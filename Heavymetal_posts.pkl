sVCan't remember this band......
p13
VDo any of you guys remember a band in the late 90's where the lead singer had real tall point black hair, used to rock his head side to side? The video was in a forest and he had a axe or a chainsaw, I can't remember the band or the video..... any help here guys?

sVLooking for some advice....
p15
VI like older metal like Iron Maiden and I've been trying to find some more bands to listen to. After some attempts I came across Skeletonwitch. LOVE the music HATE the vocals. Does anyone have any advice to other bands to look into? 
p16
sVCan someone help me figure out a metal band from late 80s, possibly early 90s?  I have very little to go off of so this is a serious challenge
p17
VOkay, so I remember a long time ago listening to this metal band and I can only vaguely remember one song that started out slow with an almost pulsating, guitar riff that was about five notes long, with a brief pause in between (reminded me almost of a helicopter) and then after a few measures of that it broke into a really fast riff with the drums playing fast like 8th or 16ths on the snare I believe.. jeez this is ridiculously vague. The lead singer's voice, though, was the unique thing I remember.. it sounded almost like he was yelling underwater. This is probably a lost cause as this is all I can remember but I thought someone might have an idea. I think I'd recognize the band name if I saw it.  I think this was from the late 80s early 90s, for what it's worth.  Thanks!

sVHow do we all feel about the new Trivium album
p28
VI know I might be late to the party but seriously, I actually enjoy the album, definitely no Shogun or Ascendancy. What do you think the redeeming tracks were? I feel Dusk Dismantled, Watch The World Burn, Caustic Are The Ties That Bind, and Of All These Yesterdays were actually fairly good tracks. Black was pretty cool, but the solo really let me down, considering that Corey Beaulieu is one of my major influences, that solo was definitely not his best. I enjoyed A Grey So Dark from the extended edition (learned to play it) but it is just more of a radio song.
