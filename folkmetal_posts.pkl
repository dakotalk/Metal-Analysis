sVWhen does Folk Metal become Metal Folk? (poor title but it's the best I could think of)
p69
VI might be thinking too much into this but I wanted to get some others opinions on it.\u000a\u000aBetween Metal and Punk we have two main genres that take influences from both, Thrash Metal and Hardcore Punk (there's Crossover and a load of others as well but I thought I would simplify it for this discussion and go with the main two in my eyes). \u000a\u000aThrash is Metal that took influence from Punk and Hardcore is Punk that took influence from Metal, both combined the same genres but focused on different sides of the coin and got two pretty distinct sounds.\u000a\u000aIs there a similar thing in Folk Metal? A distinction between Folk bands influenced by Metal and Metal bands influenced by Folk? Most of the diversity in Folk Metal I've always put down to cultural causes and different bands take on the genre but could we, for instance take Turisas and Equilibrium and say Turisas is a metal band first and foremost adding in Folk elements while Equilibrium is more of a Folk band adding in Metal elements? I'm not overly familiar with much European Folk music outside of the Scottish stuff I was raised listening too so I'm not sure how true to German Folk music Equilibrium are. \u000a\u000aCan you think of any bands that might fall into the Folk first and foremost side of Folk Metal? Saor Patrol may be a band that falls into the fringe of this as they could possibly be better described as a Folk band with Rock influences than Metal.\u000a\u000aAny input on this would be greatly appreciated, even if it's to say I'm thinking about this too much. Some times I need to here that. :)

VI'm an 18 year old metalhead from England, I've been listening to metal since I was around 10 years old. \u000a\u000aI found metal through my sister introducing me to this mysterious folk metal band known as finntroll. I used folk metal as my gateway and so moved on fairly quickly to discover power metal, black metal, more traditional bands and thrash metal. \u000a\u000aSome of my favourite folk metal bands are, Ensiferum, Finntroll, Korpiklaani, turisas and alestorm. The problem is, is that there are many bands I listen to just a couple of songs of. These are bands that I discovered when I was very young and so did not have the mind/patience to develop my interest in these bands. That's what i'm looking to do now.\u000a\u000aI need to know where to start actually getting to KNOW these bands and not just the hits.\u000a\u000aBands I need help with:\u000a\u000aEluveitie\u000a\u000aFalkenbach\u000a\u000aAgalloch\u000a\u000aArkona\u000a\u000aAmorphis (Kind of)\u000a\u000aCruachan\u000a\u000aEquilibrium\u000a\u000aHeidevolk\u000a\u000aPrimordial\u000a\u000aSvartsot\u000a\u000aTyr\u000a\u000a\u000aI need to know where to start with these bands, which albums are essential?

sVI'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert
p136
VI've never been a traditional metal fan. My music preferences range from Rush to Muse to RHCP to Metallica to Tenacious D to Cake to ... (I should probably stop before it just becomes a list).\u000a\u000aFolk Metal is something I've found that I can really get into though. I started listening to Eluveitie a long time ago, and they're still by far my favourite folk metal band (so much that I've warmed up to the "death metal" vocals that I typically avoid). I also enjoy Korpiklaani, Alestorm, and Tyr.\u000a\u000aAnyways, Eluveitie is hitting NA with Tyr and Metsatöll this year. Detroit is such a short hop across the US-Can border for me that I just *cannot* pass up this opportunity.\u000a\u000aNow, I've never been to a metal concert before. Ever. The closest thing I came to I guess was... Slash double heading with Billy Idol? And that was in an casino theatre with no floor.\u000a\u000aSo I'm not sure what to expect. I know that metal fans are all known to be extremely rad and nice people, and I know enough to leave my breakables and personal space at home.\u000a\u000aAny other words?\u000a\u000aAlternatively, who else has seen them on this tour, and how sweet was the show?\u000a\u000aEDIT: Update/review posted in comments!

Any suggestions are well appreciated, thanks!
p145
sVWhat do you think of Arkona's new album Yav?
p146
VYav has often been considered to be a classic "grower", so now that it's been out for a few months I'd love to hear your opinions on Arkona's new album. How do you feel about the direction the band is taking with their latest output? I've already heard different opinions about the changes, both positive and negative and some don't even see a change in sound and image at all. Imo Yav clearly shows more progressive and even (post) black metal-ish influences and less folk elements. I suppose some of you are familiar with their back catalogue, so I'm curious about what you think.\u000a\u000aTo anyone interested who hasn't been listening to Yav yet, here's a [link to the album on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWX1DO_rdTM).\u000a\u000aI for my part love it and would consider Yav my absolute favorite album, for many different reasons - most importantly because it's a very personal and honest album, and I''ve always been a fan of their "darker" songs. Seriously, I could go on and on about it, but for now I'm just curious about r/folkmetal's opinion.
p147
sVWhat other sub genres of Metal do you guys listen to?
p148
VI've been getting into Prog metal a lot recently, I used to be big into Tool but I never listened to anyone else. Now Mastodon Meshuggah and Dream Theater are mainstays. I also listen to a lot of Power metal, which is how I got into Folk.

p185
VSo I recently got my husband to start listening to folk metal, but I'm relatively new to the genre myself and he's very particular about what he likes/dislikes, so I'd appreciate recommendations.\u000a\u000aHe really liked Arkona and Heidevolk and a smattering of others, didn't do so well with In Extremo (apparently the bagpipes are too high-pitched?) and Tyr (not sure why, exactly). He likes Finntroll's acoustic album (or maybe he just tolerates it because our 4-year-old daughter is obsessed with it) but not their standard fare - too much screaming. \u000a\u000aAside from that, he prefers male vocals (although the deeper/richer female vocals like Arkona or, in a totally different genre, Loreena McKennitt are good too) and doesn't like too much in the way of high-pitched instruments. Bagpipes especially tend to be a deal-breaker.\u000a\u000aSuggestions?

p222
VSo I was listening to Eluveitie- The Arcane Dominion (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-hkjryDCmg) and all the sudden realized it is a tune from my childhood I loved, from the band Lothlorien, the song Dans En Dro (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T92Er46xkCo)\u000a\u000a\u000aSo this kind of blew my mind, is this awesome tune from somewhere else?
p223
sV[Request] Folk Melodic Death Metal with Traditional instruments?
p224
VBasically my favourite bands of the genre are Ensiferum, Equilibrium and Furor Gallico. I also love Svartsot's Maledictus Eris and Krampus' Survival of the Fittest. What they all have in common is that they all use traditional instruments and they aren't too "metalcore" or even chuggy death metal. It's very melodic. With Eluveitie I found there's too many dull passages with just heavy guitar riffage, aggressive drums and nothing much else going on. \u000a\u000aAre there any really good bands similar to those I mentioned above that I might have overlooked? Preferably with deep grunts but very melodic instumentals. Clean vocals just don't do it for me I'm afraid.

sVYour thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?
p234
VPersonally I'm in a stage in my life where I prefer to hear growls over everything. But folk metal is something where I have next to no tolerance for clean vocals. The only exceptions are short interludes and maybe the odd chorus if its chanted/yoiked. I'm put off bands like Alestorm and Korpiklaani and such simply due to their clean vocals. I mean I think the reason is growls and harsh vocals in general sound more earthy and non-human. Often when listening to folk metal, the folk music itself reminds me of nature, forests and meadows untouched by mankind. And the growls are almost like a primal voice of nature or something. If that makes sense. I can't explain it. lol I just like the feeling of pure isolation, and pure animalistic nature. Apart from the songs about taverns and drinking.

p246
VSongza served me up a Mago de Oz song a while back and I'm finding that I really dig them.  If you've not heard them, check them out; they have a real classic proto-metal kind of feel, like Black Sabbath or The Sword.  They incorporate folksy instruments too, of course.\u000a\u000aBut other than them, what should I look into?\u000a\u000aI've been trying to pick up Spanish for a while now.  I've had several classes in it, but I know part of picking up a language is hearing or using it on a regular basis.  Finding Spanish language music I like seems to have been difficult.  Every time I look, most of what I turn up is pure Latin music with whistles and trumpets, mariachis, sappy ballads, or pop songs.  I was really thrilled to hear Mago de Oz rockin' it on the  organ and fiddle; Finisterra just hit all of my sweet spots.  (Proto-metal feel.  Concept album.  Just a touch of proggy goodness.  Folksy.  YESSSS.)\u000a\u000aCual estan los grupos de musica que me gustan?  What are some bands I would like?  (Feel free to correct my crappy Spanish.)

sVWhere to begin with folk metal?
p355
VI absolutely love folk metal. The problem is, a lot of it is very difficult to find (different languages, etc.)\u000a\u000aSo I want to get a bunch folk metal to add to my lacking inventory of the genre. \u000a\u000aMy current favorite folk metal are things like:\u000a\u000a* Ensiferum\u000a* Wintersun\u000a* Dalriada\u000a* Alestorm (pirate metal)\u000a* Schaundmaul (not metal, but very folky)\u000a* Turisas\u000a* Falconer\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aI also like slower folk songs like Nightwish's **The Islander**.\u000a\u000aI prefer clean vocals, but if it has enough folk elements like Ensiferum or Dalriada, I'm perfectly fine with harsh vocals.
p356
sVDoes Eluveitie use the traditional Great Highland bagpipe?
p357
VI just started listening to them, and something just seems kind of different about the sound of their pipes vs the sound of pipes in other bands (Skiltron comes to mind for me). At the very least, are the somehow modified or something?

VThey look ridiculous.  I'd like to see a band that is more representative of the values I find in folk metal.  I gravitated towards folk metal because I was tired of the evil/satanic/gimmicky themes in many forms of metal.  I really enjoy the usually light hearted and fun atmosphere that folk metal has.

What instrument is it and if it's not a specialized instrument, how is that noise made? \u000a\u000aThank you all for your expertise!

sVEnergetic Folk Metal?
p537

p656
VI've been listening to about 10 or so discographies of different power/folk/viking metal bands over the past few months, and the one that stood out to me the most (and is now my favorite band) was Tyr.  They have an amazing way of putting their music together and making it seem symphonic with layered vocals.  Are there any other folk metal bands that do the same? I ask because I'm not into the screaming of most folk-metal.  It's too harsh for the grace of the melodies IMO.  I found a few that I may like already throug ht he folk metal wiki page; Triddana, Huldre, glittertind, Borknagar, and grindavisan, but they're not 100% spot on for what I really like.  So really, any suggestions?\u000a\u000aTl;dr: I like tyr's sound and how they don't scream to keep the melody in tact. More bands like this?

sVNeed some help finding scholarly works regarding folk metal
p846
V&gt;  articles in academic journals, academic encyclopedias, scholarly book\u000a\u000aI saw Alestorm's headline show in Austin on Thursday, and as part of my History of Rock course at university I need to submit a "concert report" on the show. Most of the information the professor is requesting is simple enough to gather (and I still have plenty of time to submit this assignment), but he requires at least three scholarly works that will contextualize folk metal. In addition, he also wants us to highlight any significant social movements or subcultural identity groups that folk metal stands for. Considering folk metal's relative newness, I'm at a loss for where to find any good sources on folk metal and Alestorm. Furthermore, I'm not quite sure if the subgenre belongs to any significant social movements, since a lot of it just seems to be rooted in tradition, but if anyone here has a different opinion, please share!\u000a\u000aFinally, anyone know what Alestorm's influences are? Bal-Sagoth is the only thing I'm finding online, but I'd expect some more power metal influences from Chris Bowes.\u000a\u000aThanks for any and all help, guys!

Any help would be much appreciated.\u000a\u000aPS: I was under the impression that this might be a song like "Palästinalied" that is covered by dozens of bands, so not interested even slightly in arguing about "who did it first/better."

Blending in folk music has a completely different psychological effect from just plain old metal.\u000a\u000aBlack, death, and doom metal saturate your palate, but there's not as much substance there once they whisk you off into a music trance. \u000a\u000aFolk metal's an entirely different story for me. The folk music elements construct another world where the stories of battle can come alive as the metal washes over you.\u000a\u000aI think I truly fell in love with the genre when I was listening to Ensiferum's Wanderer while doing a kettlebell workout. I finished the workout and slammed the kettlebell down to the final time they sang "but the wanderer's part is to ride alone." This music is fantastic for physical exertion, since they're always singing about rallying your inner strength to go battle.\u000a\u000a

VI was listening to the new Ensiferum album and then [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjeWql0H_0g) played.\u000a\u000aAdmittedly my favorite song in the album, and its not even metal. I have a bit of a soft spot for spaghetti western stuff in metal I guess. Anybody have any suggestions for more similar stuff I can check out?\u000a\u000aEDIT: I don't know if anybody else is interested, but I did find another spaghetti western metal band that hasn't been mentioned yet.

sVWHYBLT - What Have You Been Listening to - Idea from /r/Metal
p883
VHey guys, I came on to the sub reddit and saw very little activity. So I decided I would share some of the folk metal I have discovered recently. But then I thought actually instead of just spam, I'll put it all in one place and see if anyone else has anything to add.\u000a\u000aOf course you can write about any band here but just let us know what you've been listening to, what you like about them and anything you want to add :) I'll start off:\u000a\u000a**[Myrkgrav - De To Spellemenn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBt8im6q8xw)** - I've already posted this here but I just can't get enough of this stuff. I've been listening to this on repeat everyday at work for around 2 weeks now and I cant get bored of it. A few days ago I got in contact with Lars Jensen through reddit and he seemed like a great guy and also put me on to the fact that he is still working on follow up album to this. It's been 8 years in the works so far and sounds amazing [so far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-E1Q_yVr2U)\u000a\u000a**[Otyg - Trollslottet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4HgWPjIEY)** - Here's another one I keep coming back to, brilliant clean folk metal with some heavy riffing to remind you that this is still metal :) Love this guys vocals too.\u000a\u000a**[Lumsk - Nokken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hHUqMiFfqU)** - This song alone has so my replay ability, that riff is gripping and as hell. At first I wasn't so turned on to the female vocals but the contrast with the riffing and harmony with the additional  'folky' instruments is growing on me.\u000a\u000a**[Svartsot - Jotunheimsfærden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-FvAeMrjGo)** - Solid on every track, there really isn't much to say about Svartsot, they are simply great. Also they happen to be pretty humorous on their facebook page.\u000a\u000a**[Vanir - Hlidskjalf gynger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuvuldvxP9U)** - Another great danish band (Svarsot are danish too), this ones slightly more cheesy but there's nothing wrong with that right :) Great for having a nice uplifting time.\u000a\u000aSo that's the best of the folk from the past few weeks. On top of that I've been delving into other genres but I wont bore you with those here :) So I'll just quickly list them:\u000a\u000aUriah Heep - Exciter - Cirith Ungol - Junior Bruce - Brothers of Conquest - Buzzov - en - BLOODY HAMMERS ( I love this band) - Riotgod - Asphyx - Deathbreath - Pungent Stench - Dodsgerd (great new album from these guys) - Forefathers (this is the one you guys should probably check out if any) - Khold - Bal Sagoth - Summoning - Einherjer - Nothgard - Asmegin - Borknagar - Doomsword - Grand Magus - Weedeater - Reverend Bizarre - Count Raven - Soltice - Isengard - Naglfar\u000a\u000aWell those are the bands I finally got around to checking out this fortnight :) Let me know what you have :)

sVBands similar to Týr?
p885
VI'm new to the genre and I was wondering what bands out there have similar style to Týr? I really like their power metal-like aspect and also their melodic aspect. They also have a lack of "screaming" (don't know the right term) in their metal music so it almost seems like its not metal sometimes.

The only thing he knows for certain about it is that it had a female voice chanting in an archaic language. He thinks there might have been harsh vocals. The only folk music I had at the time was Eluveitie and Arkona, so it has to be a song by one of them. Any ideas?\u000a\u000aSongs we've eliminated:\u000a\u000a**Eluveitie:**\u000aCeltos,\u000aDessumiis Luge,\u000aLuxtos,\u000aSiraxta\u000a\u000a\u000a**Arkona:**\u000aZimushka,\u000aOdna,\u000aV Tsepiakh Drevney Tainy,\u000aKupalets

sVSearching for Pagan Metal Music Video
p1047
VHi all,\u000a\u000aA couple years back I was tooling around on Youtube and happened upon a pagan/viking/black metal music video, from I think Estonia or around around that region. I can't remember the band, or the name. Any help?\u000a\u000aHere's what I know:\u000a\u000a* there was a group of people (not band members), stomping in rhythm like in a pagan ritual, I think around a large rock or the band\u000a* at one point people were in a trance like state and then lying on the ground and shaking. \u000a* I'm pretty sure the vocals were pretty harsh, as I didn't like it at the time.\u000a* I think the band is from Estonia or thereabouts, and are considered pagan metal\u000a\u000aAny help is greatly appreciated!

p1073
VI do really like Eluveitie's style, but I'm not a fan of screaming as anything more than a small accent to a song, I prefer clean vocals, and I'm a sucker for a strong female lead. I'm also a frequent listener to Power Metal and Symphonic Metal (Blind Guardian, Sonata Arctica, Nightwish, Avantasia, Symphony X, etc.) if that helps.\u000a\u000aSongs I like:\u000a\u000a*Omnos*, *Brictom*, *Slania's Song*, and I just heard their new one *The Call of the Mountain*.\u000a\u000aCan anyone recommend me something else along those lines? Or just more generally folk metal with clean vocals? Its hard to search when you don't know what you're looking for.\u000a

sVSilly Finntroll controversies
p1102
VSo I saw Finntroll last November (3rd time for me) and have heard local folk metal fans voicing some interesting opinions about them since that most recent show.  It made me curious what folks on here think about...\u000a\u000a**1) The most recent album**\u000a\u000aA lot of Finntroll fans I know either hate it, or hate both it and the one before it, but are not very good at articulating why.  "Too avant-garde" and "too steampunk" are both comments I have heard, specifically re: Blodsvept.  And I am not sure how either of those descriptors actually translate into sound.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I like all their albums.  My only complaint is, as someone who favors black metal and its accompanying aesthetic, I liked the song topics of the old albums better (i.e. slaughtering ov Christians!), but that in no way prevents me from still appreciating the newer albums for being what they are.  \u000a\u000aSo what do folks on here think re: how the band's music/lyrics/aesthetic have changed over time?  Like, did they at some point cross some instrumental threshold for you from "silly" to "too silly"?  Do you have an opinion about the lyrics or have you never cared to translate them? etc.\u000a\u000a**2) The pointy ears**\u000a\u000aI've noticed an amusing gender-based trend in my local scene re: reactions to the whole "wearing pointy ears on stage" (as per this most recent tour) thing:\u000a\u000a**Male fans:** *(other than me)* Reaction typically entails such elements as:\u000a\u000a- Says they look stupid\u000a\u000a- Makes derogatory remark about live role-players and/or Vulcans\u000a\u000a- Complains about how the ears are detrimental to anyone taking folk metal seriously as a genre (METAL = SERIOUS BUSINESS)\u000a\u000a- [Something homophobic]\u000a\u000a**Female fans:** by contrast...\u000a\u000a- Thinks the ears are cute (especially if the girl in question owns a cat)\u000a\u000a- Appreciates "the effort" of dressing up to play a show\u000a\u000a- Is probably wearing pointy ears at the show herself\u000a\u000a- Fantasizes about being forced to spin wool and scratch Vreth's head, because trolls\u000a\u000aMade me curious what folks on here think about the ears.  Personally I'm with the local ladies about appreciating the effort (there's my black metal influence showing itself again probably) but not massively surprised at the "funny ears are a threat to my *Viking manliness!"* reaction of some of the guys + feel sorry for them if they let a show/band's music be ruined for them by something like that.  Thoughts and opinions?\u000a\u000aEDIT: because I super-fail at list formatting.\u000a\u000aEDIT #2: I just wanted to clarify, re: "black metal," I meant to provide background on what aspect of *my* tastes cause me to prefer certain lyrics/looks/etc., not to assert that *Finntroll* belongs to that genre.  Sorry if that was not clear.  Also wanted to reiterate that I personally am both pro-recent-albums and pro-pointy-ears, and am very pleased re: responses so far to see that most folks on here are apparently NOT of the mindset of certain metalheads I know IRL who take themselves way too seriously.

VI've always wondered about this. I'm dutch and I like Eluveitie and Finntroll although I usually can't understand a word they're saying(for lack of a better word).\u000aI understand mostly anything in  Dutch, English, or German I still like stuff in other languages, but I assume that's due to an international upbringing, but how does everyone else do this?\u000a\u000aAlso, from what I understand about foreigners liking Heidevolk it's the vocals, which are being caused by always having at least two vocalists singing every line. I admit it sounds pretty epic.
