VThis sooo needs to be released on dvd!
p152
aVCouldn't agree more. That should be their next re-release. 
p153
aVWith added extras, songs, etc... You know it's in a vault somewhere. Kim should get all over this. The Louder Than Love concert too! cd &amp; dvd! I've got both on video and even ripped from video to dvd but it needs an official remastering re-release.
p154
aVYou sound just like my buddy Drew. He's been wanting all of those remastered for ages. I'm hoping one day we will get our hands on all of it. I feel like the band is picking up more momentum lately which is why I love seeing fans interact on social media and groups. I know they take a lot of inspiration from peeps like us. 
p155
aVYeah, I would hope that all the social sites/ fans, etc. help push them forward. Speaking of the Louder Than Love concert video, they actually released it on cd and it had more songs on it. But it was only sent to radio stations, never a commercial release. I found a copy on ebay a long time ago, snagged it for like $60.00. I burned several copies and turned around and sold the original on ebay for $200.00!!!
p156
aVHoly crap.... have you ever thought about putting it on youtube? Is that amoral? Sometimes I never know how it's viewed. I mean we are die hard fans just trying to get a piece of something great, right? 
p157
aVI never bothered even worrying about it because I figured it was up there already. Although, I've never looked for it...
p158
aVare you in with /r/Soundgarden? I feel like you belong with us. I don't recognize your username! 
p159
aVI'm new here. New to Reddit even. I've know about it of course, visitied, etc... but just joined recently. Still learning the ropes. I've been a huge Soundgarden fan since 1989.
p160
aVPlease come to us!!! You belong here. /r/Soundgarden is calling!
