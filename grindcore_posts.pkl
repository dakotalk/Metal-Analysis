It was grindcore with bits of acoustic guitar / other acoustic instruments and some brass instruments here and there and it sounded awesome. \u000a\u000aWe simply cannot find this band anymore and it's driving us insane.

sVI'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?
p237
V I've been on an extreme metal binge as of late after several years of avoiding the genre altogether. By far, I'm most drawn to bands in the vein of Napalm Death's post-2005 releases. In my opinion, they've been rising to the peak of their career in the last few years, but I think that's likely because I value precision, a certain degree of musicality and compositional inventiveness (as opposed to just blasting and pure sonic terror, which I respect but can't really dig) as well as thick, clear recordings. I've enjoyed alot of bands, but current Napalm Death and Pig Destroyer are the two big ones by far. I like when chaos and blastbeats spontaneously transform into amazing, headbanging grooves and back again and so on. EDIT: I should also mention that I understand ND's recent output isn't strictly grindcore. So I guess I don't like purist grindcore a whole lot. Also I FUCKING LOVE Barney Greenway and Scott Hull's vocals, and very very few metal vocalists appeal to me like that. It's so real and primal. J.R. HAYES YOU SIMPLETON. Scott Hull is great too though, he can really economize.

p415
VI've always had a lot of friends that were into grindcore, but never managed to get into it myself. I'm no stranger to extreme music, and in fact love black metal and 90's hardcore. I also like a lot of the lyrical themes present in the grindcore that I've heard, especially environmentalism and anti-corporatism.\u000a\u000a\u000aOther than local bands and a 7" comp called Thrash Ahoy, I haven't been exposed much to grindcore. \u000aI guess what I'm looking for is the most entry-level pleb shit to help me understand what is good about grind and how to judge what makes good grindcore. \u000a\u000a\u000aI'm not as much looking for historically important releases (I can find that shit on Wikipedia), but instead prime examples of what defines the great aspects of the genre.\u000aThanks in advance for your help.\u000a\u000a\u000aTL;DR uninformed guy who isn't afraid of "extreme" music wants to understand grindcore.\u000a\u000a*edited for being a clump of text.

p558
VThis was a three person band, they were some really obnoxious grindcore group and I can't remember their name at all. I believe they disbanded before I even knew about them something like 5-6 years ago, and the only thing I remember about them is that in one of their videos the lead singer is wearing shortshorts, a white t-shirt, and a headband. They also have a song that has an audio clip about a minute or two in about someone's last words being put on their headstone, because they were definitely going to die.\u000aAny help would be greatly appreciated.\u000a\u000aupdated quote from that audio clip - Boy the next word that comes out of your mouth better be some brilliant fucking Mark Twain shit.

VSeriously, I've got almost nothing to work with here.  I remember it was a grindcore band's final album, them talking about how they've gone into a more "futuristic" vibe on the final album, and the track was on youtube with a still picture.  I vaguely remember it having a girl with a long green streak in her hair or something of the sort.\u000a\u000aThis is the ultimate needle in the haystack situation, but I've gone through 40 something pages of Metal Sucks (and just now realized I may have been searching for the wrong thing) and thought I'd try my luck.

VAs many of you know, Fred Phelps, the evil mastermind behind the Westboro Baptist Church, is on his deathbed. In celebration, my label wants to put together a comp, entitled "Fred Phelps: A Tribute." Any grind/powerviolence/anything similar bands that want to tell Fred Phelps to hurry up and die, and probably have the comp sent to his children, write a song lyrically matching the theme, and send it our way. Hoping to get 20 - 40 bands, so don't hesitate to join in the fun. We'll take anything grind, powerviolence, hardcore, thrash, doom, slam, sludge, even punk rock (although we might be a little picky with that last one).\u000a\u000aHere's the Bandcamp. http://dickcrushrecords.bandcamp.com/ And the Facebook. https://www.facebook.com/DICKCRUSHRECORDS\u000a\u000aLet us know on Fartbook or message me here if you want in. That old bastard's gonna kick the bucket soon, and I'd like to get a copy to Shirley while it's still fresh, so let's go go go!\u000a\u000aEDIT: A lot of people have been asking about a deadline for song submission. Which is a reasonable question. The sooner the better obviously, but really, as long as I'm burning the cdr's by the end of May or something, I don't really care.

sVGenuine Question - what do fans like about Grindcore?
p726
VI have recently given a few bands in this genre a listen, including Anal C*nt, Nasum and Napalm Death. I have really tried to identify what it is that makes this music popular to some people and, aside from the naked aggression, attitude and speed of the music, I am struggling. A lot of it seems to be primarily for shock value and the music itself just feels very 'samey'. Is that just the aggression and shock value, or is there something that I am missing that I need to listen out for or work at? I am genuinely intrigued and would welcome any input. And this is coming from someone who likes everything from neo-prog, right through to black &amp; death metal. Cheers.

p827
V I like that they're basically noisecore, but there's a high degree of intent in their sound. The drummer knows what he's gonna do to some degree, and they orchestrate their noise rather than just going nuts. I'd like the find more fusions of noise and grindcore which aren't just fucking around and making as much noise as possible. Also, grind with cool drum parts is basically like catnip for me. I like when it sounds like they're just blasting, and then you realize they're actually playing a very convoluted rhythm. Anyways, brutal stuff which eschews riffing and melody but emphasizes rhythm. It should also be noted that I really like Discordance Axis and am sick of every guitarist just recycling Slayer riffs.

sVWhat makes good grindcore to you?
p914
VI've been into grindcore for about a year now, so I'm still a newbie in the scene. I want to know what /r/grindcore looks for when they try out new grind bands.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I dig midranged and lower vocals to the higher shrieks/ screams, and I'd take groovier, riff oriented songs to non-stop blasting any day of the week. That's not to say I don't like breakneck blast beats. I just don't want to listen to machine gun speed blasts for 30 straight minutes. I'm also a sucker for half decent production. I know there's a lot of stuff out there that's pretty lo-fi, and I'm sure it's awesome, but I can't really dig it if it's borderline white noise. I also can't stand anything too thin sounding. I *love* thick, heavy low end in my grind.\u000a\u000aJust in case anyone is curious: my favorite grind bands are: Pig Destroyer, Insect Warfare, Wormrot, and Magrudergrind.\u000a\u000aSo, /r/grindcore, how do you like your grind?

VThis is the entire discography of grindcore band SASQUATCH AGNOSTIC -- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThMOKV3m08\u000a\u000aThe COMPLETE MAMMALOGRAPHY features 41 tracks &amp; 3 albums -- 'THUNDER OF THE YETI' (2007) 'GRINDHARMAGEDDON' (2008) &amp; 'IN THE CATACOMBS OF CHARENTON' (2007). This band is the brainchild of underground USA journalist Ryan Bartek, best known for his books 'THE BIG SHINY PRISON (Volume One)' , FORTRESS EUROPE (The Big Shiny Prison Vol. II)' , and 'The Silent Burning.' \u000a\u000aSASQUATCH AGNOSTIC was created to make a screaming, raging nightmare of grindcore -- like the sort of thing you'd get in a tape trade in the 90's and scratch your head saying "what the fuck is this noise?" The lyrics balance between political satire and comedic absurdity in the vein of Naked Lunch, with heavy emphasis on anarchist perception and Orwellian outbursts. Former AKA MABUS guitarist Ryan Bartek plays all instruments in SASQUATCH AGNOSTIC except the drums, and does most the vocals under the alias 'Benedict Badoglio. \u000a\u000a[DL] http://www.mediafire.com/?rutp6rfagrpxz1z \u000a\u000ayou can also download SASQUATCH AGNOSTIC and all of Bartek's books &amp; music 100% free @ http://ryanbartek.angelfire.com/blog/

V Except not just monotonous max-aggression, something that sounds really uniquely unhinged and inhuman. Creative guitar composition with a strong noise influence would be nice.

I feel like nothing really parallels the wildness of that Peel Session, but I crave less samey guitar work. It would be cool if the guitarists from Sonic Youth had a grind project.

Would anyone be able to explain to me the exact distinction between powerviolence and grindcore? Also if anyone would like to recommend some good Grincore bands for me to check out beside Rotten Sound, Cephalic Carnage, and Dr. Acula that would also be killer.\u000a\u000aTL;DR- What is powerviolence and what are some good grind bands?

sVAKA MABUS - Lord Of The Black Sheep
p1014
VThis is the long lost AKA MABUS record LORD OF THE BLACK SHEEP (2006). AKA MABUS blended every form of metal &amp; punk together in a genre-defying blasting destroyer that is best described as "grindpunk," because it has a different feel to it. Try to imagine a grind-blasting version of THE DWARVES and DK mixed with thrash/death metal sections and Frank Zappa humor. AKA MABUS burned fast &amp; hard from 2004-2006. LORD OF THE BLACK SHEEP was recorded in 2006 and unreleased until 2010. Help spread this obscure beast to grinders, metalheads &amp; punks across the globe! AKA MABUS was August Krueger (drums), General Robert Lee Simpson (Vocals/Samples) Ryan Bartek (guitar) &amp; Steve Bersche (Bass). All musicians insist you pirate this album!!!\u000a\u000a[DL] http://www.mediafire.com/?vf89673mg5zb8pi\u000a\u000aYou can listen to the full album on YouTube here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIfU2sef0zQ   \u000a\u000aThe guitarist of this band also put out many books on the underground. Free downloads @ http://ryanbartek.angelfire.com/blog/ \u000a\u000aREVIEW FROM METAL MANIACS MAGAZINE, MAY 2007: 'It's like sledding down a mountain of landmines, hauling ass like a champ to ensure you're past the next one when it blows, damn close to becoming pink snow each time. Blending grindcore, punk, industrial and thrash elements together, exposure to AKA MABUS incites an anarchic, uncontainable explosion of neurotic hate the punks, grinders, 'bangers and all chaos-born heathens into raw, demented, metallic battery will likely dig. And it bore no surprise upon first listen... A dude who expresses his inner rage towards modern humanity in any artistic way possible, 'Maniacs' writer/musician/pissed American Ryan Bartek helps man this act. I am sure others involved share and contribute to the bands message. End-bringing apocalyptic/anarcho, proto/retro, genre crossbreeding has resulted in something that's immediately familiar yet completely innovative. I need not add comparisons since it genre-jumps/mangles nonstop. Discerningly catchy, pathologically corrosive and (hopefully) morally corruptive, 'Lord Of The Black Sheep' is a f**king outstanding display of what America can produce musically, yet will remind you of its evils and contradictions in every syllable.' -Dave Brenner \u000a\u000a[IMG]http://i1338.photobucket.com/albums/o693/anomiepsyops/AKAMABUS-LordOfTheBlackSheep_zpsa0b6cb4e.jpg[/IMG]

p1086
VI have a friend who is very passionate about Metal. He loves Progressive Metal, Alternative Metal, some Black Metal, and Melodic Metal. \u000a\u000aHe despises Grindcore, though. He's a classically trained singer and a Guitarist/Singer in a Prog Metal band, and he says that Grindcore is just noisy garbage that is objectively bad music. \u000a\u000aI was defending the genre (even though I'm not a fan myself), saying that just because he doesn't understand how people could like it doesn't mean it's just factually bad music. I couldn't myself describe what's tasteful about the genre, though. This is why I'm asking this question: What is it about Grindcore you like? \u000a\u000aI mainly listen to electronic music myself. Ambient, Bass Music, Trip Hop, Drum and Bass. The only music I consider even close to Grindcore I listen to is some of the tamer Breakcore stuff. (Which if you've never heard of it, listen to this [monstrous banger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccV54B9V5HM) right here)\u000a\u000aWhat other genres do you guys like?
