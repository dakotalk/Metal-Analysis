We've made a fun video to go along with it and we'd love it you all would take the time and check it out.\u000a\u000aCheers!\u000a\u000a-Shawn James\u000a\u000aKickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shawnjamesmusic/the-gospel-according-to-shawn-james-and-the-shapes\u000aWho Did That To You video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLYc_TduONU\u000a\u000aPrevious music video from The Bear EP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH28gaXGl-U

VFrom Steve Austin (Today is the Day) Facebook\u000a\u000aUpdates! My good friend and Bassist, Randy Larsen from the legendary noisecore band Cable, has signed on to the new band I am in with Chris Spencer (Unsane), and Keith Kirkum (Weedeater). Chris and I wrote the record this last week and it was an awesome time to say the least. This isn't just messin' around, this is for real. He and I really put our all into making something that moves us and I am really proud of the end result. The next step is Randy and Keith coming to my studio in September to cut the drums and bass. If you know Randy and Keith, they are some seriously heavy dudes and I think their contribution is going to make this album devastating.

So is there any way (other than buying albums which I have done) to get them some funds, publicity, internet chatter, anything?

sVNeed helping finding a song, hopefully you dudes can weigh in.
p473
VHey guys I've been getting more into stoner metal lately, starting with sleep about a year ago and going from there into it more. I work at a music store and we get to pick what artists we put on the Business version of pandora but it won't show you the name of the song or band . I've been putting on Red Fang since it's leads to a pretty healthy mix without shitty stuff.  \u000a\u000aSo here's my thing. I've heard this sweet song a few times now and can't find who it is. I thought it was Baroness but it wasn't and like I said i'm newer to the game. What I remember most is that the chorus (or maybe the bridge) has a half time kind of feel to it and the guitars in the slower part have a rotary speaker kinda mod to them. Otherwise the song clips along nicely with some think guitar tones and deeper vocals.\u000aI know it's vague but hopefully a couple things come to mind for you guys. Thanks in advance

p539
VGreetings r/stonermetal ! I grant all of you the opportunity to hear " The Gods Of Space" A Stoner/Doom Band from Wilkes-Barre, PA (USA) we hope you like us and on my behalf i appreciate all forms of criticism.  \u000a\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/godsofspace/sets/basement-sessions\u000a     \u000ahere is a TL:DR for what I'm about to say--Drums done w/ one mic,twos guitars=SM57 Bass= Old Cardioid Mic, Vocals=Bleed from PA and overdubs.\u000a      \u000a\u000a I am an Audio engieer and this is my Band :) (no shit get to the point...) So i set us all up for a "Basement session" to get demo cuts for an EP we wanna do ASAP. I will be at the helm of the studio. We had a very basic set up in my basement which was a MXL 770 over the whole drum kit that picked up my singing that day and caused bleed on the tracks. We had SM57s on the two Guitars and a beat up Dynamic Cradiod Mic on the Bass Cab. I did Vocal over dubs with the MXL 770. \u000a\u000aComment and CRIT please :D\u000asmoke on brothers and sisters.
