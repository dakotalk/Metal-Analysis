sVRed Riot (Thailand): The Day Bangkok Burned
p6
VBangkok-based crossover thrash outfit Red Riot recorded their DIY demo on the same day that the Thai capital descended into internecine warfare on May 19, 2010 when the army launched an assault on insurgent Red Shirt brigades, leaving five dead (including an Italian journalist) and a city in shock. \u000a\u000a"We recorded these songs with the image of burning Bangkok on our minds," said the band in the liner notes. "It might be read as our sonic interpretation of the obscure situation that day due to the government censorship of the news from the frontline."\u000a\u000aThe results are chilling. Listen for yourself:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.torrents.net/torrent/484783/Red-Riot-The-Day-Bangkok-Burned-Demo-2010-%5BPunk-Thrash-Heavy-Crossover-Metal-from-Thailand%5D/

sVNot sure if this will be accepted or removed, but this is the earliest song I can think of that sounds like it has that "Thrash sound." I felt compelled to share and see if anyone else gets that vibe.

VI asked this question to Lars in his AMA and just thought I'd bring it here. I play in a thrash band in an area where it was pretty much nonexistent and we have had a really good response, but do you think it will ever make it back to the national spotlight like it was during the Big 4 era?
