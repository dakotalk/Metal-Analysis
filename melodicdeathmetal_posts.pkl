sVSymphonic Melodeath?
p6
VHey all,\u000a\u000aI have loved expanding my metal horizon thanks to all your posts, hoping you guys can help me out some more.  I love some good doom metal (Swallow the Sun, Ahab) and have enjoyed melodeath with symphonic influence (Dimmu Borgir, Zonaria, Destinity).  While I love symphonic aspect to metal, it is pretty easy to (in my mind) to have too much symphony and overpower the the great things going on within the music.  In short, I'm looking for more bands that have influences of symphonic death metal in their music.  Thank you, my brothers and sisters.\u000a\u000a**Who is ready for some At The Gates to come out or what?**

sVBands like Scar Symmetry, but with more clean vocals?
p122
VI really like the clean choruses in a lot of Scar Symmetry songs, even though the vocals are multi-tracked and a lot of people probably think they're kind of cheesy. I'm not so much a fan of the growling and screaming though. \u000a\u000aDoes anyone have any suggestions for similar bands that incorporate a greater balance of clean vocals? Spotify has not yielded anything appealing yet.
p123
sVBands with tasteful and numerous keyboards solos?
p124
VI'm looking for something in the same vein as Symphony X but with little to no clean vocals and the presence of growls\u005cscreams is mandatory lol. \u000a\u000aKalmah is something dimly similar, but I'm looking for something with more emphasis on keyboards. \u000a\u000aCould someone recommend some bands? Thanks a bunch!

sVGöteborg Melodeath (X-post from /r/Metal)
p148
V(Original post is found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/2omkmb/g%C3%B6teborg_melodic_death/), I hope to have some more succes with you)  \u000a  \u000a\u000a\u000aHi all,\u000a\u000aI'm a big fan of both In Flames and At The Gates. I Saw In Flames already a few times, last time being last oktober, when they played in the AB, in Brussels, Belgium. I saw At The Gates two times at their last 'farewell'-tour in 2008. Both at Graspop and Wacken, they brought an amazing show, and I was totally sold on them, too bad they quit shortly after that.. Or so I thought, and on the 18th of december, I'll see them in Antwerp!  \u000a\u000aNow, the last few weeks I started listening to Dark Tranquility again. I followed them quite some time ago, but for one reason or another, I lost track of them completely. Now, by listening to them again, I notice how much In Flames, At The Gates and Dark Tranqility have in common:  \u000a  \u000a* When playing [Lost To Apathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIyFHzRW0A) from Dark Tranquility in my head, it is automatically followed by a riff and lyrics from [Slaughter of the Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URhmC865SGI) by At The Gates.  \u000a* [My Negation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsyv7aPMTQ4) from Dark Tranqsuility and [Fear is the Weakness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLwa5gky-BU) by In Flames have quite the riff in common.  \u000a  \u000aJust my two cents on a few of my favorite bands. I very much like Melodic Death Metal because it has that nice melody going through the pounding of guitar, bass and drums. The combination of 'clean' vocals and grunting/screaming makes sure I keep my interest and don't fall into the "It's all screaming and I don't understand anything from the lyrics"-type of listener.  \u000a  \u000aPS: If you've noticed similar patterns in songs of these bands (or others), please point them out to me!  \u000aPSS: If you know other bands with similar sounds, please post some songs, so that I can get to know them.

p160
VIts kind of insane when you think about it. \u000a\u000aHere is an example: in Dark Tranquillity Anders Friedén did vocals for their demos and their first full length, Skydancer. DT of course also had Mikael Stanne as a guitarist who did vocals on In Flames album Lunar Strain. \u000a\u000aNow In Flames had Jesper Strömblad on guitars (and drums on Lunar Strain) who also played bass on Ceremonial Oath's first album and their demo before that. \u000a\u000aCeremonial Oath's lead guitarist during the life of the band was Anders Iwers who played guitar for In Flames in their early days before they had recorded any material. When Ceremonial Oath recorded their second album, Carpet, they were joined by Anders Friedén on vocals for one recording session (which ended up as 4 songs on Carpet with him as vocalist) who ended up joining In Flames, and Tomas Lindberg in another session (for the other 3 songs on the album). Tomas Lindberg was the vocalist for At the Gates. \u000a\u000aAt the Gates had members who would later go on to form The Haunted and the drummer, Adrian Erlandsson, is the brother of Daniel Erlandsson who played drums for Eucharist and recorded drums for 3 of the 5 songs on the In Flames Subterranean EP. \u000a\u000aAfter Eucharist Daniel joined Arch Enemy formed by Michael Amott (formerly of Carcass and Carnage (Carnage went on to become death metal band Dismember)) and including Michael's brother Christopher Amott who also formed his own melodeath band Armageddon. \u000a\u000aOn Armageddon's first album the drummer was Peter Wildoer who would become the drummer for Melodic Death/Thrash band Darkane. Wildoer also did almost all of the drums on Arch Enemy's second album Stigmata.\u000a\u000aWhew and it goes on and on! There is really no point to this thread other than to kind of just jokingly show how big of a mess the Swedish Melodic Death Metal scene was lol. Still its an interesting topic and I would love to see maybe a family tree showing what members from what bands also play in or formed other bands.\u000a\u000a*edited for mistakes/formatting

VHey eveyone,\u000a\u000aLooking for an old Melo death band I used to listen to bout 5-6 years ago. Completely forgot the name of them so ill describe what I remember.\u000a\u000aProduction had a cold edge to it. \u000a\u000aAwesome riffs, blatant ATG rip off band. \u000a\u000aMight be consider more metal core perhaps than death metal. \u000a\u000aI believe they were from Holland or the Netherlands. \u000a\u000athe album or band name might or might not have something to do with the roman era.\u000a\u000aI know its pretty vague but if anyone has any names Id love to hear em.\u000a\u000aIve been searching for this band for the past month and cant find a god damn thing.

VHey guys\u000a\u000aI started thinking back to my youth and started recalling a bunch of bands I encountered at the time. So I decided to share a couple that I guess a majority of you haven't really heard before. Some of them should be fairly unknown while some a bit more known (Absence, Satariel)\u000a\u000aFunnily enough most of these bands were actually "local bands" that I saw live at some point\u000a\u000aGothenburg had(I don't know the current sitation) a massive melo-death scene with tons of bands popping up with potential. A funny tidbit unless my memory is completely wrong. The only band that truly made it big from back then was Sonic Syndicate, however SS was nowhere near the top in the scene, they were constantly behind bands such as Avatar, Engel, Somber etc. Then they switched their style into a more mainstream approach and got their break\u000a\u000aFYI: It's possible that i've completely missed something and maybe some band is bigger than I thought, don't shoot me\u000a\u000a\u000a**Blinded Colony** (Kinda reminds me of more recent Soilwork albums)\u000a\u000a[Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73yiF8LwUcA)\u000a\u000a[Once Bitten, Twice Shy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQUZMKTx57E)\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**Arise** (Highly recommend the album "The Beautiful New World")\u000a\u000a[Dreams Worthy Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW0EUwIGMt8)\u000a\u000a[Broken Trust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVnn1AP7Vsg)\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**Marionette**\u000a\u000a[Black Hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr-v1wtb_I0)\u000a\u000a[Burn Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHYHM1NHukY)\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**Mnemic**\u000a\u000a[Deathbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGbtgCO0TD4)\u000a\u000a[Door 2.12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7cjFY3dQ4U)\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**Satariel** (Has been one of my favorite bands since I first heard them)\u000a\u000a[Black Titans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2cnepA-b5s)\u000a\u000a[Claw The Clouds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hA5Iczj9r0)\u000a\u000a[Holy Trinity (Feat.

sVBands like Whispered?
p437
VCan someone suggest bands similar to Whispered? I'm not too familiar with MDM so feel free to suggest new or old stuff. I'm coming from more of a progressive metal background but getting into some heavier stuff. \u000a\u000aMore specifically on what I'm looking for:\u000a\u000a-High energy\u000a\u000a-Abundance of solos/heavily guitar-focused style\u000a\u000a-Lots of melody, don't mind a little cheese\u000a\u000aI've seen some people say Whispered has a "Japanese" style but I figured it was just the oriental guitar and lyrical themes. However, I recently discovered the Japanese band Thousand Eyes which has some of the similar traits I listed above, so maybe there's more to it than that? I do really enjoy the stuff that reminds me of Japanese RPG music (check the solo on "Bloody Empire" by Thousand Eyes for an example, especially around the 3:10 mark).\u000a\u000aAnyway, all suggestions will be appreciated!

p461
VSo some melo death varies stylistically depending on the region, namely Swedish (or Gothenburg) which is the "textbook" melo death sound, Finnish which sometimes has a more folky or borderline black metal influence, and finally American which tends to have a more "core" vibe. So now I want to know what you fine peoples' favorite regional strain of melo death is?

p490
VMy taste in music has really developed over the years. As a kid I didn't listen to music often, but if I did it was generally something by Eminem or related rap acts. A friend of mine then introduced me into the rap/rock combo known as Linkin Park, after which I moved on to gothic rock bands like Within Temptation and Evanescence. Then came Alter Bridge, which was my first hard rock/metal act (and still one of my favorites this day), before my taste broadened to "anything involving guitar and clean vocals", the instrument I picked up myself about four years ago. Since about six years ago I listen to music pretty much whenever I'm able to. \u000a\u000aRecently I was looking into new tracks to learn on guitar, when I ran into Insomnium. Now before this I only listened to stuff with clean vocals, but something about Insomnium just made it click. \u000a\u000aThe last couple of weeks I've been listening Insomnium's Across The Dark, Since The Day It All Came Down and One for Sorrow albums almost exclusively (start to finish, not random). Especially [Unsung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns9_A3CKqPM) just grabs me and pulls me in. [Just look at this a screencap from my Last.FM.](http://i.imgur.com/wDczbSz.png) I still have to listen to their other albums, but I'll get to them soon enough.  \u000a\u000aSo that's my story of how I got into MeloDeath. Hope it wasn't too long!

VI'm relatively new to MeloDeath, and need some new bands to listen to. Lately, I've been listening to:\u000a\u000a-Insomnium\u000a\u000a-Heaven Shall Burn\u000a\u000a

sVFavorite Insomnium Song?
p635
VFor you guys that dig Insomnium, I was just wondering what your favorite songs were.  I really like a lot of the stuff off Since the Day it all Came Down but also like a lot of the shit off their newer records.  Anyways post up your favorites.  Here are my top 5 with the last being my favorite.  \u000a\u000a5. While We Sleep-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHpEzk0u6v0\u000aI actually like the cleans in this song and they contrast and make Niilo's growls all the more brutal.  The end kind of drags though.\u000a\u000a4. Mortal Share-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeIo499to54\u000aThe part from 2:58 to the end.  FUCK.  Has always been my favorite.  \u000a\u000a3. Daughter of the Moon-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTUvYutNkFg\u000aAgain, the ending section is amazingly melancholic.  \u000a\u000a2. The Swarm-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdBHZ8fFnx4\u000aBeautiful and actually can bring a tear to my eyes.  Makes me really think that yes, as dumb and stereotypical "we're all gonna die" as it is, just like the album art of the Mayflies, we're ephemeral and just going to fade away one day.  Acoustic, but still my near favorite. \u000a\u000a1. The Day it All Came Down-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpHg3k91O0\u000a\u000aThe epidemy of all that is Insomium.  Icy intro, a chorus that makes you feel like your loved one just died of cancer and brutal riffage.  This is hands down my favorite song.  \u000a\u000a"She was my sun and now the light has faded away \u000aNight condensing around me, leading astray \u000aShining image torn down, remembrance of her fades \u000aLeft but anguish and shame to haunt me in the shades"\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOkay, now lets see if anyone else is as batshit about this band as I am.

sV[META] What do you listen to your music on? Any audiophiles in here? Have you found any gear that is particularly good for metal?
p864
VI'm curious as to what kind of setups you guys listen to your metal on, mainly those who are experienced with a wide variety of headphones, amps, DACs and other related audio equipment. \u000a\u000aRecently, I have started getting into audio, (I was one of the lucky people to get a Sennheiser HD598 on sale) and as I read and learn more about people's audio setups, I figured I'd ask people who listen to the same music as I do what kind of gear they're using and if they have any special opinions relating to melodic death metal.\u000a\u000aI'm trying to evaluate if I'm satisfied with my current setup which is my new HD598's plugged into an older (2nd generation, I think) Astro mixamp that I bought like 4 years ago (It at least it beats the alternative of just plugging it into my GA-P67A-UD5-B3 mobo).\u000a\u000aThe sound on my setup is undoubtedly the best I've owned, but that bar is set pretty low. I'm overall pretty happy with my purchase but some tracks (even on flacs, not shitty 128kps mp3 or youtube) sound pretty muddy; especially with drums that have heavy cymbal usage. It tends to not be as crisp as I think it should be and perhaps blurred together. \u000a\u000aAnyways, as someone learning more about audio, I'm curious as to what you guys have to say, especially if any of you are very experienced with many headphones and would have specific gear recommendations to listing to this kind of music. If this doesn't go well I might post it elsewhere on a different sub to get more opinions.  \u000a\u000a

sVLooking for more "aggressive" style melodeth like At The Gates, early The Haunted, Soilwork, early In Flames
p895
VI'm looking for some bands I may not have heard of similar to the early "Gothenburg metal" style. I'm more looking for stuff like this for the gym, as I love Be'lakor/Insomnium style music as well but they put me in too much of a mellow and relaxed mood which is not good for lifting.\u000a\u000aWould love some recommendations!

VHi! I've posted here 8-bit Arch Enemy cover 3 weeks ago, and today I've seen it on their official facebook page. I didn't write to them and I actually don't know how they found it or mb someone sent it to them. It was absolutely unexpected. But now I'm feeling happy and want to share this feeling with you :).\u000ahttps://www.facebook.com/archenemyofficial

sVFavourite melodeath instrumental songs?
p926
VThe melodic death metal genre offers a great selection of instrumental songs. I'm pretty new to melodeath but here are some of my favourites.\u000a\u000a- Insomnium - Decoherence\u000a- Insomnium - The Gale\u000a- In Flames - The Jester's Dance\u000a- In Flames - Varmlandsvisan\u000a\u000aI've listened to more instrumentals but these are the ones I can think of any more off the top of my head. There's a couple more In Flames songs.\u000a\u000aWhat are your favourites?

sVMors Principium Est not available in US?
p928
VAfter trying to purchase MPE's new album, Dawn of the 5th Era, I realized that it was taken off of the iTunes store page. After following the online link to the album, iTunes gives me a message saying that this album in not available in the United States' store. I have also checked F.Y.E. and it is not in stock either new or used. \u000a\u000aMy question is, is there any other site besides Amazon where I can access the album? Amazon's price is around $15 without shipping, and I can;t really justify spending that right now. Or if anyone knows why MPE has pulled their music from the US, as I haven't been able to find any information on that either.\u000a\u000aThanks in advance.

p1050
VHey all,\u000a\u000aI'm looking for some recommendations on bands that are similar to Be'lakor.  Not only in how the actual music/instruments sound, but also vocally.  Imo, their vocalist is one of the best I've heard; I'm a big fan of those low, guttural growl-type sounding vocals.  \u000a\u000aAlso, I really prefer bands that use little to no clean vocals in their music. \u000a\u000aThanks!
