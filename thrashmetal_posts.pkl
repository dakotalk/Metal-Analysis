sVDo not downvote songs that sound thrash but are not made by a thrash-metal band.
p127
VI keep having genre-nazis argue with me about this all over the metal subreddits.\u000a\u000aJust because a band primarily does X genre music, does not mean it cannot make Y genre songs too.\u000a\u000aOnly upvote/downvote based on how you love/hate the song and whether the SONG's genre matches the subreddit (not the BAND's genre).\u000a\u000aWhen you downvote it, be brutally honest, say "I don't like this song." or "I don't think this song sounds thrash." However...\u000a\u000a**TL;DR: don't give me reasons like "X band isn't a thrash metal band." (no shit)**\u000a\u000aThis is a rule now, read the sidebar. You don't downvote things because a band primarily does some other genre (just as you wouldn't downvote metallica just because they 'sold out' and made rock songs; you judge each song individually).\u000a\u000aThank you for your time. Comments appreciated. Metal can only evolve if we don't constantly argue about genres.

p152
VAre modern thrash bands just dreaming of the glory days?\u000a\u000aBands like gama bomb and municipal waste sing about the past, wishing that thrash was back rather than making it so. It seems that modern thrash vocalists speak the vocals rather than roaring them out and lack the sort of passion for the genre that used to exist. If anyone can prove me wrong then I would love it but I cannot find a modern band who get me as excited as Megadeth or Testament, and THRASH is not just speed, it is aggresion, technicality, intelligence and passion. \u000a\u000a\u000aThis isn't a derogatory post, I hope to discover bands that thrill me, like [zergoth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYzAZvXSFbs) (who I am not affiliated with) Please tell me who sparks your interest in real thrash.

You see, we always see Metal Playlists on the 'Discover' tab but it's always the same old shit, we want to be different. We always prided ourselves in new music, undiscovered music, and off the wall shit you might not have been comfortable with.\u000a\u000aWe are currently on Soundrop streaming our 'Metal Delirium Radio 9/11" playlist, which is our 'new music one.'\u000a\u000ahttp://open.soundrop.fm/s/Xq6c1hVrZMrK1sK4\u000a\u000a\u000ahttps://play.spotify.com/user/metaldelirium\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the future we want to have genre specific, fantasy set lists, lesser known songs, and other cool stuff other apps and websites aren't doing.\u000a\u000aWe don't want money, we don't want to advertise, we just want you to give us a chance, share our love of metal, and share in our love of music.

VI try not to pigeon-hole myself to one metal subgenre and I sometimes hear songs or music from other bands that remind me of the aggression or riffs of the 80s/90s thrash metal golden days. \u000a\u000aDiscuss...\u000a\u000aI might do more of these monthly stickies if this one proves to be a successful discussion.\u000a\u000a**EDIT: Also try to post youtube links to good songs.**

p296
VI hope I'm not being crazy...had this album a long time ago on cassette and I swear there was a thrash version of 'Happy Birthday' as a  hidden track that always cracked me up.\u000a\u000aI can't seem to find any reference to this anywhere. I found the full album on YouTube but it cuts off after the last track. The album isn't available on Google Music either so can't check there (didn't check other sources yet)\u000a\u000aI know it's an old album from a probably not that popular of a band (although they had a few albums) but I've been trying to find this track for a couple of years. Maybe I should just order it from somewhere...\u000a\u000aAnyone remember this album? And that track?

VI really love metal. Thrash is an awesome genre of my beloved music. Perhaps it's the demographic or whatever but it's funny, I really would expect there to be a higher amount of contribution. I find myself 'holding back' suggestions to give other people a chance to peddle their wares.\u000aIt's just a rant, really, that this /thrashmetal thing just seems to be so... quiet. Where is all the input? It's a shame. \u000aIt's almost as if outside the bands that everyone likes there are a few sub-types of this genre or something of the sort that stops all us lazy bastards (and I am not exempt) from even clicking on peoples links. I would love it to be more vibrant - surely more people like this stuff?\u000a

VOk, while I've said I like thrash for a good decade, I realized recently that I don't really listen to thrash. To remedy this I've begun a band-by-band listening experience. Today I listened to the first four albums by Testament (even though I've listened to most of these before).\u000aGotta say the singer sounds a lot liek Metallica (as that is what I'm more used to), but without the frantic sound that their (Metallica) albums had. It's much more cohesive and technical then most thrash of the 80's. \u000aThoughts?\u000a\u000aMore updates as I go through my collection (almost a hundred artists within).

sV''Modern'' sounding thrash metal?
p564
VI love tonnes of 80's/90's thrash metal but I'm sick of the sound being copied by revivalist bands. \u000a\u000aI absolutely love thrash bands that have chosen a more fresh and modern sound; especially those that make the most out of beefier production. Examples would include any 2000's material by Testament , Exodus, Revocation and so on.\u000a\u000aAre there any similar-sounding thrash bands out there you can recommend?

sVCan I get some recommendations for some thrash?
p571
VIm a total music freak and I love my metal, but thrash is definitely my favorite kind of metal.\u000a\u000aLike most people it started with the Big 4. Metallica, then Slayer, then Anthrax, Megadeth....\u000a\u000aThat was a few years ago. Now I've been delving much deeper loving Overkill and Kreator, Flotsam/Jetsam, Testament, Exodus etc.\u000a\u000aBut there are so many bands it's crazy scouring through thousands just to find one good band. :) \u000a\u000aI realized my preferences tend to stray towards the Bay area type thrash ala Testament and Exodus. I adore Overkill, but aside from them, Im not a super big fan of the whole "500 mph 100% of the time" deal like, say, Kreator or something, lol\u000a\u000aAnyone got some more thrash recommendations for me?

p598
VI was reading a thread before where some subscribers were not understanding why the Big Four exists and why they are all such good bands.\u000a\u000aSo what I'm going to do is I'll list the four bands in comments and you guys can reply with **what you think is your favorite song for that band.** \u000a\u000aThis is a way to introduce some of the newer metal fans to understanding why Big Four are such great bands especially since it's been almost 30 years since the 80s and people don't get the exposure that they once had with The Big Four.

sVModern Big 4?
p616
VIn your opinion, who do you think would be 'the big 4' of today's thrash?\u000aAnd who would you rather it be?\u000a\u000aI'd say Evile (even though I don't care for them), Havok, Municipal Waste, and maybe Skeletonwitch (despite not really being pure thrash).\u000a\u000aThey seem to have the highest sales of all the newer thrash bands, and that's how the original Big 4 were decided... album sales. \u000a\u000aAnd let's just say who more than likely IS the new big 4, and who I'd PREFER are really different.\u000a\u000aI'd PREFER it to be Havok, Savage Messiah, HeXeN, and Lost Society.

sV/r/thrashmetal Do you buy the albums you like?
p817
VOut of curiosity I'm just wondering how many actually buys albums that they like? Ever since internet it is widely known that music(in physical format) don't sell as much. Spotify comes to mind.\u000a\u000aPersonally I do buy albums that I like. If I find an album that I really enjoy on Spotify, for example, I'd buy it in physical format. Why? Because I can touch it, according to me, everything that is digital is easily forgotten. \u000a\u000aAlso, when I get really old and hopefully are a grandpa. I'm gonna teach them kids what real music is all about.\u000a\u000aHow about you?

VMy label is putting together a comp, entitled "Fred Phelps: A Tribute." The "theme" of the comp is the Westboro Baptist Church. We're going for lyrical themes pertaining to the Westboro Baptists as being a hate group, and/or just down right terrible people. We're hoping to get as many bands on this as possible, so if anyone wants to contribute feel free. So far we have about 20 confirms\u000a/tracks already. It's planned for a CDr release of at least 100. We're hoping to have this out by May as well, so sorry if this is kind of short notice. It was kind of a spur of the moment idea.\u000a\u000aIf anyone is interested you can contact me on here, or at our Facebook page.\u000ahttps://www.facebook.com/DICKCRUSHRECORDS

p933
VI don't know whether to post this here or somewhere else, but I think I'm making the right choice. I've always been a fan of popular trash (Big 4, Exodus, Testament, Overkill, other stuff), but recently I checked out Kreator for the first time after constantly hearing about them. I checked out sample songs from their early days, the early 90's era and Phantom Anti-Christ. These guys BLEW ME AWAY. I'm in a country with slow-ass wifi, but I want to hear what you guys think are their best songs/albums, so that when I get home to Canada, I can buy them. Sorry for the wall of text, but I would really appreciate it if you could contribute. Please, thank you, and keep moshing.
