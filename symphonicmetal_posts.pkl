VPlease check the rules in the sidebar - no leaked tracks, please. The reason for this is that I'm hoping for some bands to discover our sub - I mean, Blind Guardian just did an AMA in r/music - and I feel it would reflect badly on us to have leaked tracks at the top of the sub. It also means that fans might think the track has been officially released when it hasn't.\u000a\u000aIf you want to make a discussion thread then I feel that would be ok, but let's avoid links to leaked songs if possible.

sVHonest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?
p102
VOK first off, I actually really liked Within Temptation's last album, *The Unforgiving*, it was a good rock album, it wasn't metal, but it had a feeling, a beat, I could drive to it, the songs had **had a hook**.\u000a\u000aHydra has none of that. The album is just crap. Not a single song on there even has a hook! There are maybe 2 total bars of music across the entire album that sound like they could turn into something good, right before the song comes crashing down to mediocrity.\u000a\u000aAm I alone in not feeling this album? Is there something I am not just getting here?\u000a\u000aThe album was apparently well reviewed, but, what the hell. Not a single hook. I don't feel it at all, and I can damn nearly listen to /anything/ and find something good about it. Even if it is in a genre that I despise, I can typically tell if a song is good. After a dozen+ listens trying to find something good in it, Hydra just sounds... boring.

sVNow that Nightwish's released "Showtime, Storytime", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?
p108
VI've been a fan ever since Once was released, so I had the chance of discovering Nightwish with Tarja. With her leaving the band, I felt like I had to get used to the new sound Anette delivered. Back in the day there was this whole "Team Tarja vs Team Anette"-thing, something I hope we fans don't have to see ever again. I wouldn't say Anette was better/worse than Tarja, it was just... different.\u000a\u000aNow, with Floor Jansen being the new Nightwish vocalist, how do you feel about her?\u000a\u000aIn my opinion, Floor's got what it takes to take Nightwish into a new era of great music. As I listened to "Ghost River" on their live album, I noticed that, aside from the melodic singing we know from Tarja too well, she was able to produce some raw tones in the song, something I haven't heard from Anette (no offense). I think Floor is a great vocalist, and I'd like to hear what Reddit has to say about it.

sVEndless Forms Most Beautiful song title meanings
p145
VPut this list together for [my blog](http://hapfairy.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/bonus-post-endless-forms-most-beautiful.html). The overall theme of the album seems to be science, nature, evolution and living a good life.\u000a\u000a1. **Shudder Before The Beautiful** - I\u2019m assuming this is the one Nightwish's orchestrator Pip Williams was hinting at when he tweeted \u201ca great rocking track that will make you shudder ;)\u201d - so looks like we\u2019re in line for another big opener, like Dark Chest of Wonders. The line features in a poem by Roy Fuller, which states "even scientists shudder before the beautiful".\u000a2. **Weak Fantasy** - Slightly strange title, this one, and a bit of a mystery. I wonder if it could be referring to believing in things without evidence?\u000a3. **Élan** - The lead single! Élan is a French word meaning spirit, zeal, momentum. Tuomas is probably referring to élan vital which was a term coined by philosopher Henri Bergson in his book Creative Evolution, to explain what he believed was the driving force behind evolution.\u000a4. **Yours Is An Empty Hope** - A reference to Dante\u2019s Inferno. This line is part of a passage about priests and holy men who are doomed because they are guilty of avarice. Most likely a dark and heavy song.\u000a5. **Our Decades In The Sun** - Taken from a quote by Richard Dawkins - \u201cThe chances of each of us coming into existence are infinitesimally small, and even though we shall all die some day, we should count ourselves fantastically lucky to get our decades in the sun.\u201d This is probably quite a positive track, given the quote.\u000a6. **My Walden** - Walden is a book by Henry David Thoreau about living in nature. The author spent two years living in a cabin by a lake and described his experiences. My guess is that this might be a ballad - we do know that it has no orchestration.\u000a7. **Endless Forms Most Beautiful** - The title track, it was already confirmed that this is a reference to a quote from Charles Darwin. \u201cThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\u201d Pip mentioned that the \u201ctitle track contender\u201d was \u201ca rousing affair, featuring the largest orchestra\u201d but it\u2019s not confirmed whether he was referring to this track.\u000a8. **Edema Ruh** - The Edema Ruh are a nomadic cultural group from Patrick Rothfuss\u2019 Kingkiller Chronicle books. They are described as musicians and entertainers who travel around trading their art for hospitality. This could be a metaphor for the band themselves. Another one with no orchestration.\u000a9. **Alpenglow** - This is the name given to the red glow on mountains just before sunrise or after sunset. Perhaps this could be a softer song, or something with more folk influences.\u000a10. **The Eyes of Sharbat Gula** - Sharbat Gula is the name of the girl with piercing eyes in the famous National Geographic photo known as \u201cAfghan Girl\u201d.\u000a11. **The Greatest Show on Earth** - The title of a book by Richard Dawkins on evolution (itself a famous circus slogan and sometimes used to refer to the northern lights - so perfect for Nightwish). As the album closer it is almost certain that this is the epic 25 minute track, and most likely the one that Dawkins will speak on. According to Pip, it has 5 parts. Apparently Tuomas\u2019s instructions were to \u201cMake it the ultimate show stopper- beautiful, melancholic, even biblical\u201d. This one is going to be big!\u000a\u000aThere's also the bonus track **Sagan** which we can assume is about Carl Sagan. Anyone got any ideas about Weak Fantasy? It's the only one that's eluding me so far.

sVUpcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014

VAt the beginning of the year I tend to do a big list on my blog of upcoming albums in the symphonic metal genre (or from bands/musicians that are closely related that people might be interested in).

Consign To Oblivion - Better with a few gems but still forgettable in my eyes. \u000a\u000a3. The Divine Conspiracy - Here is where they really try and experiment. I feel like some of the songs get lost in trying to attempt prog but lacking normal song structure doesn't make it prog. Vocals and everything else are pretty much on point though.\u000a\u000a4. Design Your Universe - I consider this their best work. Symphonic metal masterpiece. Crisp sound quality. They don't stray off from the prog completely but it's topped off with great choir work and catchy choruses.\u000a\u000a5. Requiem For The Indifferent - This album gets a lot of flak for the production quality (volume on guitar underwhelming). I can agree with that. It's definitely their proggiest album to date. Jansen's riffs just won me over for this album though.\u000a\u000a6. The Quantum Enigma - Design Your Universe 2.0. This album sees the most choir use and it's AWESOME. The quality of vocals by Simone, choir and instrumentals really just live up to their name. Lyrically, it's much less preachy(If you're a fan you know what I'm talking about) and more uplifting. In other words this album fucking rocks.\u000a\u000a**Feel free to discuss your opinions!**

VSo I've never listened to Stream of Passion, but I've been seeing them getting mentioned a lot lately with Epica and Xandria and I want to give them a proper listen. Wikipedia says they are a progressive metal band with symphonic/gothic elements. I'm not too big on prog metal, but I can deal with it if the music isn't overly complex. \u000a\u000aWhat album should I listen to first? Should I start from the beginning?

sVThoughts on After Forever?
p253
VOverall my favorite SM band is Epica... however, I have been listening to the band After Forever a lot lately and in my opinion they were very good. Whereas Epica usually is lacking when performing live (Mark's grunts suffer when he has to grunt and play guitar at the same time and Simone generally sings pretty badly live) After Forever seemed to not have these issues... in the videos of concerts I watched, Floor sang very well with only minor issues with her highest notes, and Sander Gommans (guitar and grunts) could grunt like he did on the albums while playing guitar without mistakes in live shows. Performance-wise, I think AF was overall a better band, possibly with the exception of drums and lead guitar, which are at least as good or better in Epica. \u000a\u000aThe albums Decipher and Invisible Circles (as well as the EP Exordium) also have live strings, which were mixed incredibly well in my opinion. I don't think the songwriting in AF's last two albums quite stands up to that of Epica, but their performance skills stayed sharp until they disbanded a few years back. \u000a\u000aI was wondering, if After Forever was still releasing albums and performing today, where do you think they'd rank among the major SM bands? Do you think it was a good decision on the band members' parts to break up while they were still at the height of their fame?

sVEasiest Epica songs to play on 7-string guitar?
p278
VSo I just got my seven string for Christmas, and Epica is my favorite band. Part of the reason I wanted the 7 as opposed to 6 string is so I can play Epica's music and other similar bands (e.g. MaYaN) that use the low B string. Do any of you Epica fans play their music on guitar? What are the easiest songs to start learning?\u000a\u000a(I started with Consign to Oblivion but got hung up at the short instrumental part right before "Open your eyes..." etc; I need a new song to start working on until I'm good enough to tackle CTO!)

sVWhat are your favorite themed/concept albums?
p283
VSo, in symphonic metal, several bands are known for doing heavily themed/concept albums focused around certain ideas or stories.\u000a\u000aIt'd be nice to see what people come up with, and maybe we can all find some nice new albums to listen to.\u000a\u000aMy favorites would be:\u000a\u000a1. Tristania - World of Glass (mostly gothic metal, with some symphonic influences): this one is in my opinion the best gothic metal album ever made, and Tristania's magnum opus. It deals with topics such as religious bigotry, war, depression, suicide and the end of the world. It's a very dark, depressing and tragic album, but very beautiful and with many memorable lyric snippets.\u000a\u000a2. After Forever - Invisible Circles (symphonic progressive metal): I love this album so much. It's my favorite After Forever album, and I love how it tells this continuous story throughout the entire album, with a few characters whose roles are played by the vocalists, choirs and sometimes voice actors. It deals with child abuse, loveless marriages, career obsession, bullying, escapism from reality through internet and video games, and dysfunctional family dynamics. It's a very interesting criticism of abusive families in modern society. Some would call it a metal opera because of how the album and the songs are structured.\u000a\u000a3. Epica - Consign to Oblivion/Design Your Universe/Requiem for the Indifferent/The Quantum Enigma: (it's 4 albums here, but they're very closely related thematically and lyrically): Aside from 3 of these albums being among my favorites (with TQE being my favorite album of all time), I really like the concepts and ideas explored on these albums. The "A New Age Dawns" concept, with the idea of humanity being in charge of its own fate and having the ability to repair the harm it has caused to itself and nature, as well as the idea that in modern society, people are too detached from their own humanity and spirituality and that we're driven by greed, materialism, power and a huge scientific/technological ambition to a self-destructive degree. There's also the concept of quantum mysticism, which (while pseudoscientific and likely fictional) is a very interesting way to think about the fusion of scientific knowledge with spirituality, religion and the potential existence of a deity and our connection to the universe itself.\u000a\u000a4. Nightwish - Imaginaerum: this one isn't really a concept album, but it is a themed album and it seems to have an overall strong artistic vision (especially since it's connected to the movie). It's my favorite Nightwish album, and it has some really strong melodies, a good atmosphere, as well as lyrics and vocal performances. It's also a very uplifting and dynamic album, even though it gets a bit pretentious and melodramatic in parts (such as the poem in the second half of Song of Myself), but that's sort of to be expected from Nightwish anyway.\u000a\u000a5. Within Temptation - The Unforgiving: this one is a pretty great album and I love how unique it is. It seems a bit on the linear storytelling side of things (kinda like Invisible Circles but not as structured), and I love how it's tied to a comic book story. It was really nice to follow the hype and promotion around the release period, when they were releasing the comic-book inspired short movies and music videos. It has one of the most unique aesthetics and artistic visions I've seen in symphonic metal.

sVI'm new here and I have a question
p298
VSo I've listened to some symphonic metal for a while and I was wondering about the demographic about its listeners. I'm from the US so a lot of my peers have never heard of bands like Epica, Within Temptation, Xandria, etc. Is symphonic metal considered a "girly" version of metal? This genre has been my guilty pleasure for a while. Please tell me that guys listen to these bands also.  \u000a\u000aEdit: Thank you everyone for your answers! I was kinda self-conscious about liking symphonic metal, but not any more!\u000a\u000a2nd Edit: I want to clarify that no one has actually said that symphonic metal is girly, it is just a self-conscious thought of mine and how I think other typical metal listeners might view it.

sVAny Symphonic Metal albums similar to Oceanborn and Wishmaster?
p307
VI'm not even sure I'm asking in the right subreddit. So please be kind, if I appear somewhat ignorant. \u000a\u000aIn terms of what might be branded as Symphonic Metal, I've almost exclusively listened to only two albums: Oceanborn and Wishmaster (Nightwish's Tarja-era, symphonic power metal phase). I keep trying to branch out, but I always find myself comparing other bands' vocals to Tarja's soprano. \u000a\u000aThis subreddit has been rich in suggestions. The most notable being Epica, as people say they 'sound' like Nightwish. To be honest though, I don't think I agree entirely. I can appreciate Simone, but her voice pales in comparison to Tarja's. I guess I prefer opera-like singing to Simone's - excuse the term - alternative-ish tune. I also gave other groups a listen, like Xandria, but nothing just seems to top Tarja.\u000a\u000aSo I begin to question my liking of Symphonic Metal. Can I really consider myself a "fan" of the genre if I can't seem to branch out? Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. \u000a\u000aPerhaps my taste is just too keen. It would be nice though if any of you can tell me otherwise and offer some suggestions.

VI was lucky enough to interview Zuberoa Aznarez and Gorka Elso of Spanish symphonic metallers Diabulus in Musica, who are about to tour with Xandria. And very nice they were too. \u000a\u000aThe full interview: http://npollard.wordpress.com/2014/10/24/interview-diabulus-in-musica/\u000a\u000a\u000aYOUR MUSIC IS MASSIVE SOUNDING. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT TAKES LONG 'SIT DOWN AND WRITE' SESSIONS? I COULDN'T IMAGINE SO MUCH COMING TO ME NATURALLY.\u000a\u000aZuberoa Aznarez: For us it is a very natural thing because we come from the classical scene and also the metal scene, so I think we are very used to working with each element. When I think about melody or something like that, I can hear inside me the powerful orchestra. Everything! So it all comes from our musical background.\u000a\u000aGorka Elso: It\u2019s still not easy because when you\u2019re writing, you finish the song with one hundred tracks or something like that! But it\u2019s still very natural to us.\u000a\u000a\u000aHOW CAN YOU RESIST MAKING YOUR SONGS MUCH LONGER? IT'S HUGE ENOUGH SOUNDING THAT IT WOULD WARRANT A TWENTY-MINUTE MONSTER SONG.\u000a\u000aGorka: When we write a song, when we start with a melody or a little element, usually you want to express something. You don\u2019t need too much time to express something. I love long songs. Ten minutes. Twelve minutes. But sometimes it\u2019s better to do something\u2026 well, not shorter, but only the time that each song needs. Nothing more.\u000a\u000aZuberoa: Yeah. I think sometimes it seems like a good song has to be long. It\u2019s not always that way though. I think the song is asking for something. To be short, to be long\u2026 or whatever. Doing a long song only because it\u2019s supposed to be a better song\u2026 we don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. We only make what we think the music needs.\u000a\u000a\u000aON THE SUBJECT OF THAT KIND OF MUSIC, HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO SAY TO ANYONE WHO THINKS THAT METAL IS A STEP DOWN FROM CLASSICAL MUSIC?\u000a\u000aZuberoa: I think that both kinds are complimentary. Metal music is a very rich style too, because I think you can do whatever you want with metal. It\u2019s very open to other kinds of music, not just classical music, but also kinds like folk. You can fit many different styles inside metal. A lot of metal musicians are from the classical field so I think in generally, music is music! With music, you can do so many things, and you can express so many different things. It\u2019s stupid to do only one thing, so to lineate all of the different qualities of your personality is bad.\u000a\u000aGorka: I think that metal with symphonic music is the perfect marriage, to express many different kinds of things. Each of our songs are not just symphonic or just metal. We want to do all kinds of music that fits with what we want to express.\u000a\u000aZuberoa: There are many different elements. There\u2019s classical music. Also folk. Also some electronic stuff. We never say no to something new, because every musical element can express something special.\u000a\u000a\u000aYOUR NEW ALBUM IS CALLED ARGIA. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?\u000a\u000aZuberoa: It is a Basque word. It means \u2018light\u2019 in Basque language. Some people think it\u2019s related to a Greek mythological thing called Argia, but it\u2019s another thing. We chose the name because we speak Basque here, and \u2018light\u2019 refers to the new. The former bandmates had left the band, so we had to start from scratch.\u000a\u000a\u000aWITH SUCH A DISTINCT ALBUM TITLE, ARTWORK AND MUSIC, IS THERE A THEME, OR CONCEPT OR STORY BEHIND IT ALL?\u000a\u000aZuberoa: Not really, but all the songs are related with personal things from the last two years like when the guys left the band. So it has been a very personal process because we didn\u2019t know what to do with the band \u2013 whether to continue with it. We were a bit lost. Finally we decided to continue because Gorka and me are the founders of the band, and also the main composers. It made no sense to leave it. All the songs refer to the new light we had found not only in the band, but also as individuals. We are a couple too so these last two years have been also special for us, so I think it\u2019s a mixture of a new musical path, and new personal life.\u000a\u000aYou have used quite a few languages in your music. Why do you refuse to settle on just one? Have you ever been worried about how songs might be received?\u000a\u000a\u000aYOU HAVE USED QUITE A FEW LANGUAGES IN YOUR MUSIC. WHO DO YOU REFUSE TO SETTLE ON JUST ONE? HAVE YOU EVER BEEN WORRIED ABOUT HOW SONGS MIGHT BE RECEIVED?\u000a\u000aZuberoa: Well, not really. On one hand, yes, because we are from the north of Spain, in the Basque Country, so when we started to write our songs, we started in English. Our first album was in English and some Latin words in the parts of the choir. We started only with English and Latin. So, when we decided to write a second album (The Wanderer), I decided to use Basque because I thought it really fit with the story, because the story of \u2018The Wanderer\u2019 is talking about someone very special and different and strange. It\u2019s a very ancient language. And then we eventually wrote in Spanish!\u000a\u000aHere, there are political problems because of the Spanish people and the Basque people and all that stuff, but we don\u2019t like politics at all. We only defend culture. We are Spanish. We are Basque. We are both. We don\u2019t want to enter any political issues, but if we only sang in Basque then some people would only see the political side or something like that. So, I decided to include Spanish. Well\u2026 not only because of that! (laughs) So that\u2019s four languages.\u000a\u000aGorka: And I think Italian is on the last album too!\u000a\u000aZuberoa: I don\u2019t know if in the future if I\u2019ll maybe play with French!\u000a\u000a\u000aThe full interview: http://npollard.wordpress.com/2014/10/24/interview-diabulus-in-musica/

VI get a bit OCD when it comes to labeling my music correctly, and I've been stuck on quite a few of them...the one I can't figure out most would be Epica. I've seen them referred to as many different things, and they definitely have influences from Symphonic, Progressive, Gothic, and Power Metal all in one, which makes it difficult to call them one thing.\u000a\u000aI'd like to be able to just call them Symphonic Gothic Metal (with obvious heavy Power Metal influences) but it feels kinda weird to put them into somewhat of the same category as a band like Sirenia.\u000a\u000aThere's some other bands I get stuck on, but they're either not in the Symph. category, or not worth the trouble debating. I just like to be able to call a band (or at least each of their albums) one thing, whenever it's within reason to do so (since many bands change their style up a lot).

VJust wondering how everyone else does with this. It's probably not a big problem if you live in Finland or Sweden, but I'm in North America and get weird looks when someone asks me what I'm into or listening to. Doesn't help that I'm male and don't really look "goth" or anything. I get stuff like:\u000a\u000aThem: What are you up to this weekend?\u000a\u000aMe: Going to a concert\u000a\u000aThem: Cool! Who are you going to see?\u000a\u000aMe: Um, (Within Temptation / Nightwish / whoever)\u000a\u000aThem: Oh.. um never heard of them. What are they like?\u000a\u000aMe: It's symphonic heavy metal\u000a\u000aThem: ? (weird looks) I'm not sure what that is....\u000a\u000aMe: It's heavy metal with operatic singing (or extreme choir, or some other lame explanation...)\u000a\u000aThem: Oh I see... so like Evanescence...\u000a\u000aMe: Um, not exactly, but kinda that direction...\u000a\u000aIt's rare that I get any more questions, the topic is mostly avoided after that. And if you're in a situation where people are playing music like a party, whatever you do don't put on your stuff if they're listening to White Stripes or Lamb of God or Linkin Park or some shit (although I do like me some LoG once in a while). \u000a\u000aDo you think this is an acquired taste? Or did you have an "a-ha" moment when you heard it? For me it was "wow, where has this been all my life", but the others just don't seem to get it. Which explains why I have to travel fairly far for concerts that are 2000 people or less. Sigh.

sVLet Us Burn Discussion Thread
p409
VWho has seen Within Temptation's latest DVD *Let Us Burn*? What did you think? Any favourite tracks? Would you recommend it?\u000a\u000aI'll start: I was very impressed with the *Elements* half. I'd already watch fan footage on YouTube back when the band were adamant that it wouldn't be released, so I knew what to expect, but it was great to see it in HD. It was interesting to see that the dance performances and cover songs were cut or just not focused on - I guess the band realised it was pretty weird as well. The show is impressive and interesting to watch with the orchestra, effects and staging. I loved hearing older songs like Candles, Our Solemn Hour and The Promise, and rare tracks like The Last Dance and Say My Name. Stairway to the Skies is a beautiful ending which really brings everything together.\u000a\u000aAfter that, I found the *Hydra* side a bit of a let-down. If you've seen any show on the Hydra tour then there's not really any surprises. Sharon sounds quite tired and gets out of breath a lot - perhaps because it's the end of a long tour. I enjoyed Paradise, Silver Moonlight and Covered by Roses, but I felt a lot of the Hydra songs weren't very strong and some other tracks were repeats from the show we'd just watched. The choice to do 2 acoustic songs right at the end was a bit odd and slows the pace. It was a fun show overall, but perhaps not up to usual WT DVD standards. I guess that's why they added *Elements* to it. It's a shame this meant both shows had to be trimmed down a lot.\u000a\u000aI would definitely recommend this DVD,  but I'd probably say to watch the *Hydra* side first and the more impressive *Elements* performance second.

sVSymphonic Metal with blast beats
p416
VSo as you're probably thinking, I'm a big fan of blast beats. My teen years were full of bands like Emperor, Dimmu Borgir and other symphonic black and death metal bands.\u000a\u000aMy question is what bands with a more Epica/Nightwish/Within Temptation feel to it (female vocals, less black metal) that still have a good amount of blast beats in it?\u000a\u000aI may be shrinking the options with the specificity of it, but I really do miss them since discovering and becoming obsessed with this genre.\u000a\u000a**TL:DR: Bands like Epica or Nightwish that have more blast beats?**

A beautiful process. And since the idea, the musical dream that is NIGHTWISH has been a part of me since before I was born, I am delighted to officially sail into uncharted waters with my brothers and sister. Wondrous scenes Ahoy!

p443
VI've listened to the album completely about 3 times already. I like it better after every listen. Some really good songs, some not so great. To me, this album is truly a mosaic of what they are capable of; most songs are straight up symphonic metal, some just generic metal, some a bit on the pop metal/rock side, and some experimentation (i.e., Xzibit). Some songs are reminiscent of their previous albums. I should also state that I was never a fan of The Unforgiving, so to me this album is positive step forward.  \u000a\u000aA few thoughts on each song:  \u000a\u000a1. Let Us Burn\u000a&gt; An excellent song; a great opening piece. Catchy and reminds me of their older work. Probably my second favorite song on the album.  \u000a\u000a2. Dangerous (feat. Howard Jones)  \u000a&gt;I wasn't particularly excited about this song when it was first released, but after many listens, I like it. Howard Jones' voice really compliments the song. \u000a\u000a3. And We Run (feat. Xzibit)\u000a&gt;I was most apprehensive about this song. This is definitely experimenting for WT. I was expecting this to be horrible, but was pleasantly surprised. I should note that I am an occasional listener of hip hop so my opinion may be biased, but this song works. Xzibit is able to rap successfully with the chugging riff of the guitar and his voice isn't too aggressive for the WT sound. My only gripe is that this song is more like an Xzibit song featuring WT; he had two verses compared to WT's one. \u000a\u000a4. Paradise (What About Us?) (feat. Tarja Turunen)\u000a&gt;I love this song. When they first released this song, I was instantly in love with it and got me excited for Hydra. This song is the epitome of the WT sound and of course Tarja is excellent in this song. Her soprano voice is a great compliment to Sharon's light mezzo-soprano voice. \u000a\u000a5. Edge of the World\u000a&gt;This is a good song; it took me a few listens to truly appreciate it, however. To me, it has a Silent Force vibe to it. A pretty light song where Sharon is able to demonstrate her vocal abilities.  \u000a\u000a6. Silver Moonlight\u000a&gt;This is without a doubt, my favorite song on the album for two reasons: 1) it reminds me Mother Earth and 2) GROWLS!! I liked the demo version, but the final product is leaps and bounds better. WT haven't experimented too much with growls and although not perfect, I think Robert's growls suit Sharon's voice just fine.\u000a\u000a7. Covered By Roses\u000a&gt;This is an okay song; a little too generic and "poppy" for my tastes, but I'll be damned if this song doesn't get stuck in my head.\u000a\u000a8. Dog Days\u000a&gt;In my opinion, the weakest song on the album. I never liked the demo version, and the final version isn't that much better.    \u000a\u000a9. Tell Me Why\u000a&gt;The longest song on the album, clocking in at a little over 6 minutes. A very good song. Some growls present on this song as well, but not as prevalent as in Silver Moonlight. \u000a\u000a10. The Whole World is Watching (feat. Dave Pirner or Piotr Rogucki)\u000a&gt;A nice duet to end the album. The Polish edition of Hydra features Piotr Rogucki, whereas the other versions feature Dave Pirner. Both versions are excellent. I tend to like Piotr's version a little more. This song is reminiscent of Utopia, albeit more heavy and dynamic. \u000a\u000aOverall, I am quite pleased with this album. Mother Earth will always be my favorite from them, but ultimately bands change and I like the direction this album takes. The title is very fitting as they demonstrate to their fans the different types of songs they are capable of creating. My rating for Hydra: 8.5/10  \u000a\u000aI'm curious to hear what everyone else thinks.\u000a\u000aEdit: it looks like I'm in the minority

p455
VI have yet to ever be able to experience any band live, and with Kamelot/Nightwish both coming to my area next spring, I'd love to be able to do so, now that I have the money to be able to do so. I don't have anyone to go with, but one of my best friends said he'd be willing to go just so I have someone to be with.\u000a\u000aSo, that led me to wonder about pricing:\u000a\u000aKamelot/Dragonforce - $30 normal, $100 VIP Preshow/Meet-greet/Poster\u000a\u000aNightwish/Delain - $35 normal, $180 VIP Preshow/Meet-greet/poster/Tour program\u000a\u000aI'm not familiar with pricing, but $180 seems a bit excessive ($100 is pushing it a bit, but sounds fair to me)...what would this "tour program" contain? If I'm bringing a friend along, There's no way I'm paying $360 to bring him along with that part. \u000a\u000aAlso, from what I've picked up, Epica coming to North America has been scrapped...any talks of that being re-arranged? Was really excited to see them all in one year :c\u000a\u000aSide question - Are Simone/Floor/Tommy known for being good singers, even when live? I understand nothing is going to be studio-quality, but it's a huge let down when I listen to a band live and the singer's voice is all over the place...ruins half the song for me &gt;.&lt;

sVNightwish Live?
p539
VI asked about various bands and their live performance qualities a few months back...long story short I'm likely going to pass on the Kamelot show, and go for the Nightwish one, with VIP. Apologies for a lot of questions in this one post, but I want to know what I'm doing before I spend this much money...\u000a\u000aThat being said, how has Nightwish's live performances been so far on the current tour? I'm sure it varies from night to night, but as far as live goes, I've only seen their DVDs, which, I'd imagine, is probably edited a bit to make it sound better. That could be false, but idk. If they actually sound as good as they do on the DVDs, then I'm insanely excited.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, what exactly do the VIP tickets for the Nightwish shows include? Enterthevault says "includes pre show meet and greet, poster and tour program". Tickets are $180 which is *really* pushing it, but I think it's worth it. How personalized, if much at all, is the meet and greet? Is it just walk up get a signature and leave, or do you actually get to talk briefly? I'd love more than anything to be in the presence of Marco/Tuomas/Floor, or even have them sing a note or two out loud. And what does "tour program" refer to?

Would you like to see a collaboration between genres (like Within Temptation did with Xzibit to mix metal with hip hop)? etc.  \u000a\u000aPersonally I'd like to hear a duet between Simone Simons of Epica and Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth.

p614
VSo this is kind of strange, but I'm not a huge Nightwish fan ^^^please ^^^don't ^^^hate ^^^me  \u000a\u000aI am a fan, just not a huge one. Help me change that. I want to get ready for their new album and explore their music a little more closely. I'm a huge fan of Floor and of After Forever (and ReVamp) so I really want to put in effort and familiarize myself with their discography. I have heard most of their popular songs (Ghost Love Score, Romanticide, I Want My Tears Back, Nemo, etc.), but I haven't really given their other songs a chance, which is weird because I'm a fan of a lot of symphonic metal bands (some popular and some obscure). I guess I just never cared to really take the time and listen to Nightwish (who many consider to be one of the best symphonic metal bands). \u000a\u000aSo in your opinion, how would you rate their 7 albums from best to worst. Thanks!

sVThe 25 most upvoted songs on this subreddit
p627
VDon't take this list too seriously. The number of upvotes any submission gets will depend heavily on how many subscribers the subreddit had at that time, how much other stuff was submitted around the same time, and a wide variety of other factors. I just went through the [top scoring links](http://www.reddit.com/r/symphonicmetal/top/) tab and selected "all time". I think this may also favour more recent submissions over older ones, even apart from the growth of the subreddit.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aWith that caveat, here is the list of the 25 most upvoted songs in /r/symphonicmetal:\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**THE TOP 25**\u000a\u000a1.

They are followed by Kamelot (3 songs), then Delain and Within Temptation (both 2 songs). Tarja has one song in the list, but it is a Gary Moore song covered by Nightwish and not a track from her solo career.\u000a\u000a* There are 5 collaborations in the list: Within Temptation feat. Tarja (*Paradise*), Delain feat. Marco Hietala (*Your Body Is a Battleground*), Kamelot feat. Simone Simons (*The Haunting*), Kamelot feat. Elize Ryd (*Veritas*) and Tarja feat. Floor Jansen (*Over the Hills and Far Away*).\u000a\u000a* There are 5 live performances in the list.\u000a\u000a* There are 2 covers in the list: Epica's *Imperial March*, and Tarja's version of *Over the Hills and Far Away*.\u000a\u000a* Two songs are listed multiple times. One is *Ghost Love Score* by Nightwish, with a live version, an instrumental version and the original album version. The other is Epica's recent single *The Essence of Silence*, of which the first link got deleted from YouTube and the later link was the official lyrics video.\u000a\u000a* Surprisingly absent is Nightwish's [live version of *Ghost Love Score* in Buenos Aires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brcfttchzA). There are three other versions of this song in the list, but this performance is widely regarded as the best.\u000a\u000a* If the list were expanded to a top 40 it would include these currently unlisted bands: Luca Turilli, Evanescence, Tuomas Holopainen, Xandria, Turisas and Diablo Swing Orchestra. In that order.\u000a\u000a* The biggest symphonic metal band that does not make the top 40 is Leaves' Eyes, which really surprised me. Their most upvoted song is [*Symphony of the Night*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AOVC030DoY) ([thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/symphonicmetal/comments/1tn4my/leaves_eyes_symphony_of_the_night/)).\u000a\u000a* A number of other successful bands didn't make the top 40, but there are probable explanations for those. Tristania for example is generally considered gothic rather than symphonic metal, and their recent albums are much less symphonic than their earlier ones.

sVHas Symphonic Metal been a bonding experience for anyone else?
p687
VGoing to see Sonata Arctica with my dad Tuesday and it really dawned on me that symphonic metal has been a bonding experience for us. It started with an off chance day where I had just discovered symphonic metal via Nightwish and the album Once. His car was in the shop so he needed a ride to work, and I had known about Nightwish for a couple days and had the album Once playing. When Planet Hell came on he got this look of amazement of his face and asked what this was because it sounded amazing. I told him about it and ever since then he and I have had a common musical interest with all these bands like Nightwish, Kamelot, Delain, etc. we have been front row for Nightwish (w/Floor), front row for Kamelot (w/Tommy), and coming Tuesday hopefully front row for Sonata Arctica. And no I am not embarrassed or anything that my dad is up there rocking it out with me. lol\u000a\u000aThank you Symphonic Metal! :) just something I wanted to get off my chest. If anyone sees a guy with a limp and a balding older man with a mustache at the concert in Orlando Tuesday, say hello. :p

sVKamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?
p754
VAfter over a year of being stuck on Silverthorn and seeing Kamelot preform twice, I have come to the conclusion that I prefer Tommy over Khan. I recently popped in Ghost Opera, don't get me wrong, that album is unbelievable, but I almost wish it had Tommy's voice on it. Tommy has such a range and I feel like he does Khan's stuff live better, just an overall better live performer. Aaaaand it also doesn't hurt that Tommy's kind of a heartthrob. ;)\u000a\u000aWho do you guys prefer and why?

VI often times see symphonic bands with the label of gothic metal. I've seen Within Temptation, Epica, Delain, Xandria, etc. all labeled as gothic metal at one point or another. Is there a distinction between the two genres or are they kinda related? When I think of "gothic" I think of bands like H.I.M., Lacuna Coil, Evanescence, etc.

Tell me about your favourite band and their song, or maybe the album that might get me hooked.\u000a\u000aI got hooked to Within Temptation cause of The Heart of Everything and Nightwish got me with Once. Though I do love both of their earlier works once I listen to it more.\u000a\u000aI'll try to listen to all of your listed choices.

sVExploring new Symph. Metal bands
p891
VSymph. Metal (and all the variations of it) has been arguably my top favorite genre for many years now...it all started when a friend showed me Ghost Love Score by Nightwish, and Nightwish has since then remained a top favorite band of all time (although The Poet and the Pendulum has taken its place as my favorite Symph. Metal song).\u000a\u000aThat further chained into getting into all of the following bands at some point (some more than others, such as having only heard one album by Xandria, but all from Epica): \u000aAfter Forever, Dark Moor, Dimmu Borgir, Edenbridge, Epica, Kamelot, Mortemia, Nemesea, Pythia, Rhapsody of Fire, Serenity, Sirenia, Tarja, Tristania, Within Temptation, Xandria.\u000a\u000aThere's bound to be plenty of notable bands of the style that I've missed out on so far, and I'd love some pointers on which ones I should look into first, based on the list above :3

sVWhy isn't Hydra talked about more?
p894
VI know it's a year old, and I know Symphonic Metal never gets much acclaim, but Within Temptation's Hydra is an incredible album, with nothing but top reviews. It is top to bottom with excellent tracks, and each track pushing in different directions to avoid a similar sound or boredom. I can't praise the album enough, it's incredible.\u000a\u000aBut I rarely see it discussed or mentioned. I was expecting it to at least be brought back up as a "Best of 2014" but it seems its early in the year release had it fade from everyone's minds. Why isn't it talked about more? Is it not "symphonic metal" enough? That seems to be the chorus around here lately, for a lot of things.\u000a\u000aI think it's an incredible album. And the reviews agree with me.

Lack of options to remap keys (*very* annoying for a left-hander like me).\u000a\u000a2. The crashing, obviously.\u000a\u000a3.

I brought Epica up on a long thread with a fellow metal-musician on a website and it they stopped replying! Only a couple other musicians had anything to say other than that they disliked Epica..... unless I come to subs like this where there are other fans. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Any ideas where this is coming from... I was just curious.

sVMarco Hietala to be second guest vocalist for Delain's upcoming album "The Human Contradiction".
p924
VOn their FB page, 40mins ago :\u000a\u000aProudly announcing the second guest vocalist for our upcoming album \u201cThe Human Contradiction\u201d\u000a\u000aMarco Hietala [Nightwish]\u000a\u000aWe are very excited about the much anticipated return of vocal force Marco Hietala on our upcoming record. After our collaboration with Marco on our first two albums we can\u2019t help but hearing his voice in some of the songs we write! We love his contributions on The Human Contradiction: Marco adds greatly to the power of \u201cYour Body Is A Battleground\u201d as well as to the melancholia of \u201cSing To Me\u201d.\u000a\u000aMarco states: \u201cI´ve done quite a few visitations on select albums during my career. Delain and their albums are among the most frequent. If you listen to their stuff, you´ll know why. Martijn and his group seem to have plenty to say both musically and lyrically. Keep it up mates!\u201d \u2014

p1012
VI have no idea if I am in the minority, but I can't stand it when symphonic metal bands add death grunts to their songs.  Within Temptation did it on their first album(and I think once in their latest one) and I don't find it to be a feature that vibes with the genre.\u000a\u000aAnyway, with Floor joining Nightwish, I figured I should check out the discography of her previous band, After Forever. I've been disappointed they frequently have death grunts in the music. \u000a\u000aDoes this always remain so, or did they remove that aspect later? Thanks.
