aVCheck out Manowar, Megadeth, AC DC, Dio, Motorhead etc. They are all bands coming from the same era and roots.
p35
aV&gt;Manowar, Megadeth, Dio (including heaven and hell, which was dio + black sabbath, as well as rainbow, elf, and his solo stuff), Motorhead\u000a\u000athese. \u000a\u000aalso, if you're looking for another band with polarizing vocals, try 3 inches of blood. you'll either love them or hate them. \u000a\u000aif you like maiden dig deeper into the power metal genre, manowar is a good start. \u000a\u000amy suggestion HIBRIA http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdfFqiRonO8\u000a\u000aalso try iced earth, here's them covering iron maiden's "hallowed be thy name" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PVbzO0X6dU\u000a\u000aand some originals \u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlfOaZF77MA\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jGw3QXsnTY

aVNot sure how you feel about power metal, but maybe Helloween? Pretty good power metal band from the same era as Maiden.

asVCan someone help me figure out a metal band from late 80s, possibly early 90s?  I have very little to go off of so this is a serious challenge
p39
(lp40
VThe 'yelling underwater' part makes me think of The Jesus Lizard. Hardly a metal band, though. 
p41
aVThat's not it.  Thanks though.
p42
aVDo you remember what kind of metal it was? \u000aMost early 80s thrash and teutonic metal had heavy reverb on the vocals. Everything from Metallica to Sodom to Kreator. \u000aFrom your description, though, it sounds like you're talking about [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GASMNuD3yk&amp;feature=channel) by Morbid Angel. 
p43
aVFigured it out after seeing [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/9vyrq/ministry_jesus_built_my_hotrod/).  Was Burning Inside by Ministry.
p44
aVWhere the Slime live... yelling underwater...
p45
aVAs crazy as it is that this song fits perfectly with my description, it's not it, lol.  I'll try and see if I can rack my brain further to remember other aspects of it.  Thanks though!!

There's lots that's just meh, I don't really hate that much. I've found most metal fans are pretty polarized about the metal they listen to though.
p72
aVWhy does everybody hate Dimmu so much?  Is it because they've had some commercial success?
p73
aVA lot of it has to do with sounding like ass.  I wasn't aware of their commercial success when I first heard them but still could not stand them.  And, I like some crappy black metal.
p74
aVTo each his own, I guess.
p75
aVGojira live was underwhelming. It's that whole european metal stage mantra. Doesn't make for an interesting show.
p76
aVMost of the "metal" I "hate" isnt really metal. I absolutely HATE Dream Theatre/Dragonforce, but i consider them progressive or tech rock, or cock rock or ego rock or anything but metal.
p77
aVdouble enter (line break) for nice list =D
p78
aVBad Brains is metal(punk)? You hate meshuggah(awesome)? Seems you left out some of the good nu-metal (Chimaira comes to mind). If you can hate on progressive cock rock like dream theater, why not Rush? I do like your respect to older bands like Morbid Angel, having said that where's suicidal tendencies or coc? Eh, Guess the list is subjective, but a pretty good list nonetheless. Who doesnt love deicide and slayer? Who doesnt hate Savatage?

p88
(lp89
VExcellent best album i've heard in a very long time. They really did focus on the music on this album instead of showing off.
p90
aVDefinitely the best metal album I've heard this year, I still need to hear the new Mastodon album though. I personally felt none of the songs got super bland at any point, but I feel that you can't listen to 'In Waves' the song without 'Capsizing The Sea'
p91
aVAgreed that capsizing the sea makes in waves that much better 
p92
aVOne upvote for you good sir.
p93
aVI personally really like it a lot.  I would not say that it is their 'best' per se, but it definitely does not let me down.  I would definitely say that it was one of the better albums released recently.
p94
aVit's a trivium album. clearly should be downvoted automatically. 
p95
aVTrivium's new album is ok, but it doesn't compare to their shredding of the others.\u000aYou should check out Machine Head's "Unto the Locust" album that was recently released, that's some metal for ya. \u005cm/
