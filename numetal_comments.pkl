asVLinkin Park - The Hunting Party [FULL ALBUM]
p84
(lp85
VSounds great.
p86
aVYou got a downvote because this band doesnt deserve respect anymore.  Fight tooth and nail to release your first 2 albums on your own terms, then for the rest of your career make the music your label demanded of you in the first place.   And this was after the track "Get Me Gone," where Mike Shinoda talked about the album that Warner wanted instead of Hybrid Theory, which then turned out to be what they released for Minutes To Midnight.  On top of that, the recent fiasco with Rome Ramirez, what they did to the band Dry Cell, and them being generally pretentious whiney hipsters nowadays, i just cant bring myself to give anything they release a chance anymore... my former favorite band died to me years ago... 
p87
aVWhat'd they do to Dry Cell?
p88
aVWhen the Queen Of The Damned soundtrack came out, Dry Cell was signed to Warner Bros records, had begun touring in support of their soon-to-be-released album Disconnected.  When the members of Linkin Park heard the song "Body Crumbles" they pitched a hissy fit claiming that Warner was pushing a band that had stolen Linkin Park's signature sound (the sound that they have since abandoned), mostly because of the similarity between Chester Bennington and Jeff Gutt's singing styles.  When Warner let Dry Cell go, they refused to ship the hundreds of thousands of copies of Disconnected that had already been pressed and sought legal action if they continued to perform the songs from the album, all of which they wrote before they were signed.  This effectively put an end to one of the most promising underground bands of the last 2 decades, all because Linkin Park have a history of being whiny bitches that always have to get their way 
p89
aVDamn. I always wondered why Slip Away or Body Crumbles didn't rocket those guys into super stardom. As much as I love Linkin Park, I gotta agree that they get whiney more often than any band should.
p90
aVI think it's normal thing and understandable because they aren't that young and emotional anymore. They can't make something that they don't feel anymore. I appreciate their new stuff.\u000a\u000aSorry for my bad English, I tried my best.

aVCool! Thanks, I'll definitely check some of these out!
p349
aVOne that I didn't find in nssone's list was Staind. Check out their earlier stuff like Dysfunction and Break the Cycle. Then check out their newest album just titled "Staind." In between those albums they kinda changed styles. \u000a\u000aAlso, another I don't remember seeing in the list was Adema.

p412
aVOf course, but calling it nu-metal made me really, really angry :(.
p413
aVFair enough. They're basically the definition of prog metal.

p415
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nu_metal_bands\u000a\u000aSoulfly, Divide, Disturbed, Ill Nino are good ones
p416
aVMy suggestion is to go to a streaming music service like Pandora or Slacker and put in a band like Flaw. You'll find a bunch of great nu-metal bands through this way.
p417
aVKorn(as long as its not "See you on the Other Side", the untitled album, or "Path of Totality")\u000aDusturbed,\u000aOtep,\u000aSwitched,\u000aGodsmack (technically not nu-metal but still pretty badass.)
p418
aVI loved Hypocrites, Politics, 10 or a 2way, etc. Just because you're not a fan doesn't mean they're terrible albums. 
p419
aVYou are right about that. However, if you really want to hear that more old school korn sound that made them the nu-metal icons that they are today, I would recomend to stay away from those 3 albums. Not that those albums dont have anything to offer, they are just not the best representation of the genera. 
p420
aVthe path to totality was half good half bad in my opinion. only dubstep ive ever enjoyed is kornstep
p421
aVI can understand at some degree with SYOTOS and POT, but not really with Untitled. It's an interesting fusion of Industrial and Nu-metal.\u000a\u000aEver be, Hold on, Kiss, Killing, I Will Protect You/Sing Sorrow (Rant: It's really impressive that they made two songs with the same composition) Are some really good tracks on Untitled imo.

p423
aV&gt;numetal is full of a lot of absolute shit.\u000a\u000aWhich bands do you mean?\u000a\u000a&gt;Things to stay away from (IMO)\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;    Disturbed\u000a&gt;    Papa Roach\u000a&gt;    any rap/rock overlaps like Linkin Park, Kid Rock, Crazy Town, or Limp Bizkit\u000a\u000aWhy stay away from these bands? This is just your own opinion, why should anyone else stay away from them?\u000a\u000aI would say that [Infest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF8-bYhj7I4) is one of the best nu metal albums ever. Of course after that Papa Roach changed their sound and it is no longer nu metal.\u000a\u000aBut I agree MSI is worth listening to especially [If](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UFqIucFW0Q).
p424
aVIf you haven't yet, you should try some Dry Kill Logic.\u000a\u000aOne of my favorites from them, is Nightmare\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIu6e21lOtg\u000a\u000aYou can listen to every single one of their songs here:\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkpWrtwighk
p425
aVSevendust (first and second album in particular, "Home" is my favorite) Ultraspank (self-titled album is genius, second one flopped but it has a few gems IMO), Chevelle (lots of great songs, pick one), Deftones, Mudvayne, Static-X (Wisconsin Death Trip album), The Blank Theory, Element Eighty... maybe not all technically Nu-Metal but I listen to them all in the same rotation. And Tool... always Tool.
p426
aVDeftones, Eths is also a cool French band(check out their early stuff), Ill niño, Love &amp; Death (Korn guitar player is the singer), Mudvayne( L.D.50 only), Static-X,  Taproot, Chevelle,  Coal  Chamber. That's all I can think of off the top of my head. Enjoy!

p507
aVIt's more like how the whole last half of the song just drops down into his soft singing but never picks up again. I wouldnt've minded it so much if it was just a slowed down bridge then picks right back up into the way the chorus was in the first half of the song or even heavier than that.

aVThey're still alive but they're a shell of their former selves compared to this era of their music. No Mark doing their vocals. Their second singer that they had for their *Planets* album sucked. It became some kind of pop rock crossover crap. They had a reunion with Mark for a while but that didn't last long.

Spend a weekend roadtrip getting drunk and laid visiting every shop, and asking one question:  Who's the local engineer of choice?  Tally the votes at the end, then go suck that guy's cock if you have to, but get him to make one badass track with you.  Fail here, go to school.\u000a\u000a

When Head left, they never got another full time guitarist to replace him, so when he came back there was no one needing to step aside. Ray is a great drummer in his own right, and I've been impressed seeing him play live. If David came back in any form, it's hard to say what would happen but I think Ray would get fucked over in some way.

p814
aVGood post OP, made me happy on the inside. There are so many blaring double standards toward Nu Metal that so many good bands have been swept under the rug completely. And honestly, I think the comeback that its making is much more welcome this time around. Look at My Ticket Home's new album for example. It's like Nu Metal 2.0 without all the over production, plus it was well received. There is hope, the direction Nu Metal is headed is actually pretty bright.

asVWhat exactly is NuMetal? Sevendust is not one, are they?
p863
(lp864
VNu-Metal is less of a genre and more of a wave of music (e.g NWOBHM). No one in the right mind can say a band like System of a Down sounds like a band like Linkin Park or Deftones, but their music all came out around the same time so they're all classified as Nu-Metal. Nu-Metal is more general genre mixing than just rap &amp; rock (E.G, Slipknot barely raps in their songs, but the mix of clean vocals and groovish like riffs makes them nu-metal.)
p865
aVOMG, someone who doesn't think anything rap+rock=nu-metal. Thank you, good sir. 
p866
aV I believe NuMetal is the classification for hard rock that came out in the 90s after 80s metal dried up. Most genres are descriptive of the music itself while numetal is more of a time period in metal history. Actually that may be why smashing pumpkins and STP are considered grunge, they came out along side the grunge movement...\u000a\u000aSource: rode the numetal wave to regional famousness in the latter half of the ninetes playing in a hardcore band
p867
aVYes, yes they are numetal. 
p868
aVNu-metal is a derivative of metal, hip hop, and alternative. It uses downtuned guitars, and a combination of melodic singing and screaming. Solos are very rarely used and lyrical themes are usually personal and depressive. The bass is commonly slapped and guitar riffs are usually simplistic. Verses are usually accompanied by eerie guitar tones and ambience. It is not uncommon to see synthesizers and even DJs in nu-metal bands. \u000a\u000aPopular nu bands would include Korn, System of a Down, Slipknot, Sevendust, and Mudvayne. \u000a\u000aTo easily identify a song as nu-metal, check to see if it has metal-style instrumentals, singing/rapping, and a simple song format (ie intro-verse-chorus-verse-chorys-bridge-chorus-outro)\u000a\u000aEdit: just a note: only LiP and FtL are nu-metal albums by Korn. the other albums range from electro-rock to groove metal with melodeath influence

aVFor me it was Bat Country by A7X. The first time I heard it was on Rocksmith, that Xbox game that is like guitar hero, but with an actual guitar. The preview the game gave of the song was right at the solo, and I ended up selecting it, but instead of playing it, I just listened, and it was badass. Quickly got all of their albums, then got other bands like Slipknot, and I love it all

Vother than the obvious ones i would say my favorite nu metal bands would be mudvayne and Lacuna Coil. least favorite? Mushroomhead and papa roach 
p994
aVPapa Roach has some damn good songs in my opinion, but their radio singles are shit. Last Resort is one of the worst nu metal songs ever.
p995
aVInfest is one of my favorite albums. But they just kept getting worse after that.
p996
aVI love Infest. Thrown Away is quite possibly their best song.
p997
aVi like a couple roach songs but they don't do much for me

aVStaind are pretty bad, but Hollywood undead are fucking awful imo 
p1001
aVStaind has some good songs, but I completely agree with Hollywood. Terrible band.
p1002
aVEw I totally forgot about Hollywood Undead. I can't take them seriously at all.
p1003
aVRight!? cringey as fuck, as well as bad in general 
p1004
aVI used to listen to them when I was 12-13. I cringe at the thought of it..
p1005
aVI listen to Slipknot, Limp Bizkit, Deftones, Korn, Linkin Park, Static-X, Powerman 5000 and Coal Chamber. Sometimes to System of A Down and Mudvayne. I listen to what I like.\u000a\u000aI can't get into Papa Roach. They have some okey songs, but nothing spectacular, to me. Spineshank is not THAT good, to me. It just doesn't click for me there.
p1006
aVOooh I forgot about Spineshank, I love those guys. Still, it was a bit if a stretch giving them a grammy nomination. Are you excited for Coal Chambers new album?
p1007
aVI really am. The thing I am wondering a lot about is the sound of new album. They have said it will be a lot different... For some reason I can feel that the first song they will release will have a The Negative One-feel to it. It will just punch you in the face and when it is close to the end, it finishes with power and then just dissapears.\u000a\u000aIf that made any sense! Are you excited?\u000a\u000a
p1008
aVHell yeah I'm excited! I loved Dark Days to death, still my favorite album of theirs. That album on it's own was way different from Chamber Music, which is way different from their self titled. If they continue on the path that they were on before splitting up I have no doubt their next album is gonna kick ass. Dez said himself that he's never been more excited to be in the studio working on something, so there are virtually no negatives about it in my mind.
p1009
aVHopefully, this will be mindblowing!
p1010
aVI love Deftones, Limp Bizkit, Korn and more but I don't remember. There's a band who is very confusing to me, Papa Roach. I love pre-Infest albums like Old Friends From Young Years or 5 Tracks Deep or even Infest itself, but I goddamn hate all the albums after that I just can't get into it.
p1011
aVI completely agree. I love all of Infest except Last Resort. Can't stand that song for the life of me. But its the other way around for the rest of their albums. I can't stand most of there albums at all actually. The only other ones I like are The Connection and like half of Lovehatetragedy and Getting Away With Murder. Metamorphosis was awful, so was FEAR, so was Paramour Sessions. It's so weird, I've never been so all over the place with a band. 
p1012
aVI've never been a fan of Linkin Park, and fuck Hollywood Undead.
p1013
aVI think Korn is pretty fucking horrible. But then again, I'm not really a big fan of Nu-metal. Disturbed and Slipknot is pretty much the only nu bands I listen to. 
p1014
aVIf you don't like Nu-metal then why are you subscribed to this sub?
p1015
aVWell, I didn't say I don't like Nu-Metal at all. It's just not my favorite. I try to keep a open view on metal,  and I'm subbed to pretty much all metal subreddits. If someone share some new music I can check it out and see if I like it regardless of sub genre. 
p1016
aVMore metalheads should be like you dude.
p1017
aVIf you don't like nu metal you're probably not gonna like Korn. I'm surprised you like Slipknot though, most Slipknot fans love Korn. 
p1018
aVHuge korn fan here. Can't stand slipknot. 
p1019
aVI stand corrected. Did you catch em on the prepare for hell tour?
p1020
aVI live in Canada.., Alberta, and it's busy season I the oil and gas industry right now so I couldn't get anytime off work, unfortunately no, I'd really only want to see korn. I'm sure they'll do another tour.
p1021
aVThey plan on doing a 20th anniversary tour for their self titled album so hopefully they'll give Canada a visit.
p1022
aVThat would be nice 
p1023
aVI agree with you. I'm not exactly a massive nu metal fan, but there are a few bands I like (Disturbed, Slipknot and Mushroomhead being the main ones). Korn is just...terrible. I think they have 3 songs that I like
p1024
aVYou're breaking my heart man, Korn is my favorite band lol. But I totally get it, they're definitely not for everyone. So what bands outside of the nu metal realm do you listen to?
p1025
aVMelodic death is my favourite genre, but I listen to pretty much anything. Some of my favourite bands are Destinity, Arch Enemy, Kataklysm, Metallica, Dimmu Borgir, Psyclon Nine
p1026
aVLove me some melodic death metal, just recently saw Amon Amarth live. And I've met very few people who like Psyclon Nine, I love em. If I could recommend one nu metal album that I think is one of the best it'd be The War of Art by American Head Charge. If you're into Slipknot you'll probably like it, seeing that clown helped produce it.

(lp1088
VAbsolutely love this band. Best song of the album right here. Progress is quite possibly the best nu metal album ever. 
p1089
aVYeah, Progress is one of my favorite albums too.
p1090
aVProgress is the only album I go back to and listen after about a decade when I simply lost interest in rock music overall.  And I pretty much saw every act there was to see back in those days.  Truly a horrific thing for those guy's to be so under the radar when they clearly had tons of tracks that should have been at the top of the rock music charts. I think I blame Roadrunner for not putting in effort enough as far as marketing for them. \u000aHowever,  the band's members and their good characters brought them really close to their fans.  And from what  I remember,  they really cared about the community they played in.  And you could see Pete talking with the fans about personal issues and giving them advice they normally would not get at home or anywhere else.  So did the rest of the band.  I like to think of them as people that were from the future.  They understood the problems we were facing back then.  They were full of wisdom.  And am sure they still are. 
p1091
aVIt was a mixture of absolutely zero promotion from their label (thanks RoadRunner) and being a day late and a dollar short on the nu-metal craze. Such a shame, this band was so far ahead of most, if not all, the mainstream bands at the time. Progress, along with a handful of other albums, are the ones I recommend to people who are brand new to nu-metal. In my opinion, Progress is the sound of nu metal at its finest, right along with American Head Charges album The War of Art. And Pete, along with 2 other Ultraspank members, are in a new band called Lo Pro. They're also phenomenal.

VThey're really a pretty unique band.  There isn't going to be as easy a comparison to them as most other bands.  Perhaps if you chose a particular thing that you liked the most about them it would help.  The manic singing?  The guitars?  The lyrical subject matter?
p1168
aVI *really* like the singing and drumming.
p1169
aVIf you don't already know about it there is Serj Tankien's solo work, and Malakian's side project Scars On Broadway. They aren't SOAD but it is familiar feeling.\u000a\u000aOther bands I enjoy but not necessarily System-like in no order: \u000a\u000a* Disturbed\u000a* Device &lt;- Has a song featuring Serj\u000a* White Zombie\u000a* Rob Zombie\u000a* Volbeat\u000a* Stone Temple Pilots\u000a* Audioslave\u000a* Soundgarden\u000a* Rise Against\u000a* Rage Against The Machine\u000a* Queens Of The Stone Again\u000a* Hail The Villain &lt;- Hope these guys are going to do more\u000a* Bullet For My Valentine\u000a* Alice In Chains &lt;- Really enjoy their new album
p1170
aVI think most of these are in the general ballpark. The true problem is there is nothing like SOAD other than SOAD. Serj and Scars are pretty meh. Elect the Dead and Harakiri were okay, but the was something missing. Reminds me of looking for other bands like Coheed and Cambria. Sometimes bands get lumped into a genre they truly are kinda into but mostley just progressive with a lot of influences to a particular genre.
p1171
aVMaximum the Hormone. Yeah, they are Japanese, but the energy is very similar to SoaD.\u000a\u000aEdit: single off the newest album\u000a\u4e88\u8972\u5fa9\u8b90 \u30de\u30ad\u30b7\u30de\u30e0 \u30b6 \u30db\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3: https://youtu.be/beN5ep5MrdY
p1172
aVCheck out The Apex Theory. The original drummer of SOAD was the singer and did a pretty damn good job at it. I'd also recommend Ultraspank (these guys have an album called Progress that is regarded as one of the best nu metal albums ever), Mudvayne, Nothingface, Spineshank, Cold, Unloco, American Head Charge, Ill Nino, Breaking Benjamin, and a whole bunch more. Dude if you ever want new music hit me up!
p1173
aV[Opus Dai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgqdtjRha4), for some reason they came to mind. Not a well known band, but I think they go towards that unique feel that System fills. You're not gonna find something that sounds the same, even this doesn't, but it's different from the other suggestions you've gotten on this page. \u000a\u000a

sVCan we get a blacklist like r/metal?
p1238
(lp1239
VLike the others are saying, blacklistning the big band is not needed yet because of the subreddit being so small. But the re-post rule from /r/metal would be nice, so we still could see numbers from the big and small bands and not see "Falling Away From Me" - KoRn for the X time.
p1240
aVI would say this sub is too small to start banning things like that just yet.  
p1241
aVI feel like the best and biggest days of nu-metal are behind us, and although I love the genre, I think that it's unavoidable that there is going to be a lot of re-posting moving forward. 
p1242
aVI think we should just blacklist certain songs like "Freak on a Leash" by Korn, "Rollin" by Limp Bizkit or "Chop Suey" by System of a Down.  Most nu metal fans already know those songs so there's no point in posting them.  People could still post unknown songs from Korn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Slipknot or System of a Down but not their biggest hits.

aVYeah I still like the original better, while I like screaming I think it sounds better if it is just used to punctuate the song, if the whole song is screaming it puts me off.

(lp1482
Vi started listening to this band a few weeks ago and fell in love so bad! i like all the albums, even the non industrial ones (though i'm happy it was just a two album detour) I could go on forever talking about their songs!
p1483
aVName your favourite tracks from "tonight the stars revolt" "anyone for domesday" "somewhere on the other side of nowhere" and "builders of the future". If you can't do it ;)
p1484
aVwhy leave "true force", "mega kung fu radio", "transform", "korea" ep, and "destroy what you enjoy" out? Well, I'd say that "When worlds collide" is killer and has some sexy vibe to it, "blast off to nowhere" is a pretty good collaboration with his brother rob.\u000aFrom "Anyone...?" i'd like to point out "the future that never was", it's got all the feels and is unlike any other PM5K song.\u000aFrom "Somewhere..." I'd have to say my preferences aren't so original, my favorite cuts are "show me what you got" and the sensuous "supervillain"\u000aAs for "builders ..." i think "how to be a human" is just a strong as hell single and is simply oozing with decadent vitality. The title track also caught my attention above the rest.\u000aThat being said, I like all of their songs a lot and appreciate every album. From their covers album, I think they really nailed "space oddity", which is pretty tough, considering how good the original one is. I've heard some really lame pop covers of that song and they really didn't do it justice like spider one and co. did. \u000aAlso, what do you think about their videos? I was kind of let down by "how to be a human"'s video after all the crazy sci fi the previous ones had. I understand the label won't give them a ton of money for it like before, as the industry isn't was it was back then and the band isn't as popular, but I think they at least could've put some live footage in between and some takes other than just the band playing locked up in a room.\u000a
p1485
aVFor me it's be the future that never was as well, evil world from their newest, and get your bones in my opinion is the best track of off somewhere. I never got into mega Kung fo unfortunately, just wasn't my thing. For transform id have to say song about nuthin or free. It's really hard to pick favourite off of albums because one day I'm really enjoying one song and then another day it's something else. I really like devil inside on copies and clones. Space oddity is probably my favourite as well. As far as ttsr I think id have to pick either super nova goes pop or good times roll. Also about the whole video thing, I mean the video for free isn't anything crazy, or action. Spider looks like he's having fun as per usual, I will agree the video isn't anything like bombshell but I feel like it captures the heavier feel of electronics that were present in this album and kind mixes that in with their style in this video, at least that's the vibe I get from it. Sorry it took me awhile to reply btw, keep saying i should and then forget. \u000a\u000aEdit: on my phone so I didn't really feel like making paragraphs or any of that, sorry about the rough writing. 
p1486
aVOh, never mind about the delay, I took quite a while myself. \u000a\u000aPicking up on "Builders..." having a heavier electronic side as you mentioned, I have been thinking that maybe it is because Spider is now completely in control of the band's direction. Though I like the new album as much as the older ones, this makes me think that maybe we'll never get to hear the potential of the new bass and guitar players. I thought that in this last record the guitar was a little behind in the mix for my taste, though not always, of course. Not that I oppose the full-on electronic moments that some songs, like the title track, have. What do you think about their show openers this tour? I really wasn't too big into Wolfborne, but American Head Charge gets me roking with their more agressive songs. About the new pair (knee high fox and hed pe), i don't dig Knee high Fox too much, but i could still listen them for a short while without feeling bothered. Hed pe is in my opinion the best of the bunch and a terrific opener. If PM5K ever came to South America, it would be cool if those guys opened.\u000a\u000aOh, and Wayne Static's passing was pretty damn sad. I felt it mandatory to point out. Both Wayne's work with Static-X and his solo record were very good, and I had become increasingly attached to them this last few weeks. Too bad I could never see him live, he put up one hell of a show.

aVI've never seen pm5k live and I would absolutely love to, I live in Canada so it's just as unlikely for them to come up here. I'm not a huge fan of watching shows live on YouTube personally, it never does them much justice and is hard to find decent quality ones; so as far as any of their openers go I couldn't tell you a thing on my personal opinion. Now static x was a band I was for sure starting to get into, they're good, but like most bands I can't seem to enjoy all of their music, or even that much of, I found they were quite good in small bursts, as to where I could like to pm5k for hours non stop. Since were on the topic of nu-metal, how do you feel about slip knot? Personally can't stand them. I think they're absolutely horrible, I like the lead singers side project stone sour 20x better then slip knot. Another nu-metal band that I love is korn, as unfortunate it as it is, I find they haven't been able to quite stand the test of time as well as pm5k has, in my opinion of course. I loved untouchables and it's easily my favourite album by korn, shortly followed by issues and then self titled. If you have high or decent quality headphone(100$+) I recommend giving the untouchables album a good listen... It brings a new level to korn most people don't even notice. Lots of little things you'd miss in your car. One more band I would recommend listening to, and all though they aren't nu-metal would type o negative. If you like weirder, music that to most people go "not bad..." At first glance then they're that type of band. The more listen it seems the better they get. Much like tool and qotsa. 
p1488
aVHmm... I actually do like slipknot, but I don't really listen to them that often. I know that the comparison with mushroomhead is pretty stupid and that it's a rivarly that should've never existed, but I like mushroomhead a lot better and i think they look cooler (as in having a better thought up aesthetic). I'm not too big into koRn, i used to listen to them when i was younger though. I liked ad.i.d.a.s. a lot, and a while ago i watched the video for "blind" and found the song pretty cool. The thing with them is that i don't like their sentimental songs. It's not that i have anything against heavy bands having sentimental songs, but i don't happen to like korn's too much. Still, I'll give their discography a deeper revision, especially Untouchables.\u000a\u000aOn the subject of headphones, oh yes, music is a hell of a lot better with good ones. Mine aren't too fancy, but at least they're not cheap earbuds or overpriced fashion items. The experience of listening to something good straight from the original CD or a FLAC file with good headphones is always great, and lets you discover all the little details of the production (especially with industrial or industrial influenced albums), i sure love it.\u000a\u000aType o negative is great!  I would recommend [9electric](http://www.9electric.com/media/music/), they've got a pretty good industrial sound and have a collaboration with Wayne static. Do you like industrial bands that rely almost purely on the electronics? I get a good kick out of listening to Skinny puppy and Laibach.\u000a\u000aQOTSA are pretty damn good. I've actually been avoiding them for a while because I'm still gloomy over not having been able to see them when they came over a few weeks ago (I had to choose between that and a festival that included Deep Purple, at least I enojoyed Deep purple thoroughly, they put a spectacular performance).\u000a\u000aThere's a couple of professionally recorded PM5K performances on youtube, you could look them up, if at least to hear a different take on some of their songs. I agree on most amateur videos of bands not being so enjoyable, I checked this tour's openers via their studio material. Too bad PM5K hasn't released a live album, they're tight enough performers to deliver a solid hitting one. There's a decent amount of live PM5K on "the good, the bad, and the ugly, vol. 1" but that covers their rap era only. Then there's the live version of When world collide that came as an extra with some copies of Destroy that you Enjoy, but just that.\u000a\u000aBack to nu-metal, what do you think about Dope? I checked them because Tripp Eisen (the sexual-assault-guilty guy from Static-x) played with them. I found them to be quite my cup of tea. A smaller band I stumbled upon by coincidence is Motograter. The custom instrument they took their band name from gives them a terrific sound in my opinion.\u000a\u000aOh, and just not to leave some big names out of the discussion, what are your thoughts on Nine inch nails, marilyn manson and rammstein?\u000a\u000a
p1489
aVSee for me dope... Is pretty boring, I liked one album and it was a pretty solid album, their first one I think?(one with "spine for me") and the rest was just to much screaming. I think that's why I'm rather weary when it comes to nu-metal. Some of it's awesome and some is horrible. Hearing that from a korn fan must be weird, but I think that's why I can't get into slip knot, or lamb of god, or dope, or even pantera for that matter. There's just too much screaming. I find a scream really accents a song when it's used properly and not to often.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately I didn't hear you touch on the subject of tool... Which makes me a sad character ahaha as they are my favourite band. As far as NIN goes, I really enjoy them, an yet I still have to be in the mood to listen to them, I saw them along with sound garden live this year and I can't decide which was better, but I might have to go with Chris Cornell on this one, he voice out performs Trent reznor everyday. (I'm pretty opinionated on certain things, but still love to hear other peoples opinions and am willing to re look at things). As far as Marilyn Manson goes, they've got some really damn good stuff, and I enjoy a lot of their music, and as cool as their remix's are, I feel like it's too much sometimes. \u000a\u000aI don't need how you feel about more metal like rather than nu-metal, but you should give iced earth a listen if you enjoy Metallica. They're a smaller band, not known very well, and yet I really really enjoy their music. Ashes of ares isn't to bad either, their newer and I bough one of their albums, kinda cool to listen to just to throw another name in there. \u000a\u000aNow I'm gonna throw some random bands names, all from different styles and I'm curious your take on them(I like all the bands I'm about to mention) \u000a-rage against the machine\u000a-red hot chili peppers \u000a-rush\u000a-the offspring\u000a-ministry \u000a-limp bizkit(yes they're fucking awesome)\u000a-Isis(really really solid instrumental, lacking vocals)\u000a-godsmack\u000a-Alice in chains\u000a-alien ant farm\u000a-Chevelle(very hit and miss for me)\u000aAnd I'll end with billy talent.(probably one of top favourite bands)
p1490
aViced earth is pretty solid, i haven't listened to them all that much, but hell do I respect them.\u000a\u000aI didn't know about ashes of ares, but as soon as i searched for them on youtube and found their stuff on the nuclear blast records channel, i knew i was about to listen to some ass kicking material. Thanks for that one, it's killer.\u000a\u000aRage against the machine is by now a classic, i love their stuff. I also like Red Hot Chili Peppers a lot, though as hipster as it sounds, i resent a lot the fact that they've become so massively popular, there's just a lot of jerks that have jumped the RHCP bandwagon. Not that I like them any less, I actually own Blood sugar sex magik and One hot minute on cassette tape. I like their first album best though.\u000a\u000aRush is great, again, a classic. Not one of my personal favourites, but still always impressive and a pleasure to listen to at all times.\u000a\u000aMinistry is unbeatable. I hadn't listened to them that much til this year (I started to get more into industrial this last few months, that's when i got into powerman 5000). They're powerful on every level. I'm planning to get some part time job during the summer so I can save to see them live (they're coming to my town in march! talk about cool!)\u000a\u000aI had always dismissed the offspring and instead listened to more classic or harder punk, but giving them a listen, they're actually good in their own way.\u000a\u000aLimp bizkit i really dislike, though there are other rap-rock and rap-metal acts that i enjoy, like early powerman 5000 and Motown Rage.\u000a\u000aAlice in chains and godsmack I find pretty damn good. Two big thumbs up for those, superb music.\u000a\u000aI had read a bit about Alien ant farm because Terry Corso had played with them before (and after) being a member of Powerman 5000. I just listened to one of their songs and it sounds very promising. Nice stuff, gonna make them room in my grooveshark playlists.\u000a\u000aI knew that isis was a metal band with a solid reputation, but hadn't given them a listen. I just tried them and they sound great, right up with what i had read about them.\u000a\u000aI only knew Chevelle and Billy Talent by name before checking them right now. Chevelle sounds great from what I've just heard, good rythm. The same for billy talent, i got a pleasant surpirse from checking their stuff.\u000a\u000aFurther discussing more bands, what do you think of Coal Chamber? They are one of my favorite nu metal bands, and the video for "Loco" is one of my favorite music videos. And what about Soil? Though their sound isn't so innovative, i feel that they pull it a lot more real than other successful bands, and that their angry and/or emotional moments sound pretty honest. \u000a\u000aBack to tool, i think they're very good, but not my taste too much. I don't like the singer and their complexity alienates me somewhat, not for the complexity itself, but it doesn't appeal too much to me in the way that it is. I do like stuff like King Crimson, Yes, Buckethead and Steve vai, which are also complex in their own ways.\u000a\u000aWhat about primus? I love them to the bone, and had the chance to see them for the first time at a music festival this weekend. Their set was short but manic, the crowd went nuts.\u000a\u000aA topic I've got to touch, if at least as a side remark, is glam/sleaze metal. I'm a huge glam metal nut both for the music and the looks. I hallucinate with stuff like motley crue, tuff, ratt, warrant, poison, and so on. Most metalheads dislike it, so i wouldn't be the least offended if you did too, but i wondered what you'd think.\u000a\u000aAs a last thing i'd like to make a personal recommendation, [2X.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFdSrIRgvDI)\u000aIt's kind of corny to recommend a band just because it's from my country, but hey, they're pretty good and have a lot of respect in the local scene, and, well, all the more chances you haven't heard of them.\u000a\u000aSorry if it came out too long, hehe; and for the delay, this last two weeks were pretty busy at the university, being the last two ones before the summer break, exams and all that jazz.\u000a\u000aregards
p1491
aVI tried clicking that 2x link time and time again and just got nothing, I'm on mobile so it seems impossible to touch, maybe a song along with it so I can search it up on YouTube?\u000a\u000aAlso I gave coal chamber a listen, and they're just not my style, unfortunately I'm kind of odd when it comes to music. I much more enjoy the technical side of things, and songs with more.. Emotion. Wether that be down on yourself, expressing the way you see the world etc. Even while listening to pm5k not all of their songs have some sort of deep meaning behind it, but in general a lot of songs give you a general vibe and the message their trying to get across. Like I said earlier, I believe screaming can be amazing if used well and not to often, that and their lead singer just was kind of generic. \u000a\u000aI don't mean to be an asshole when I talk about music either it's just something I spend a lot of time with, I'm listening to my music at work, at home, on the weekend. So I've become kind of hard to break out of my comfortable shell. I enjoy what kind of music I have and what I listen to, it's hard for me to get behind a new band. There's lots of times where I've given some honest chances and just can't do it.\u000a\u000aBack to montley Crüe and etc. I don't mind that kind of stuff to be honest. It's nice every once in awhile, I wouldn't consider myself just a metal head though either. I enjoy all types of music(besides country, country sucks) I'll listen to rap every once in awhile and still enjoy me some relapse or good kid MAAD city. Also well done electronic music isn't bad on the odd chance either. So I'm decently open to music. I find as much as I do enjoy metal, some if it's really damn good, or absolutely horrible, I enjoy bands that are a little weird, stick out.  \u000a\u000aI get side tracked a lot and talk to much ahah sorry about that. Anyways poison is cool, def leppard use to be my favourite band when I was younger and I still enjoy that music. \u000a\u000aAs far as primus goes, ya they're not bad, kind of cool, just a band that never quite did it for I suppose. \u000a\u000aI know you weren't big into tool, and you don't like the lead singer. Now do you not like his vocals? Or because he can be a dick? Because if it's because he can be a dick I think you should give "v for vagina" by puscifer a listen, it's a weird sound, and personally my favourite album by them. \u000a\u000aI think I touched on everything? I'm not sure I could talk about music for days. \u000a\u000aBig sugar is from my country and I think you should give them a listen, they're pretty damn good, and "all hell for a basement" has a pretty good meaning behind it, if you understood anyways, still and awesome song. \u000a\u000aHow do you feel about xzibit? Not to sure what your stance on rap is, but IMO he's probably the most under appreciated artist out there. \u000a\u000aOne last thing before I polish things up! I my favourite steams from bands like , tool, type o negative, powerman 5000, Alice in chains, and QOTSA(not in order) but if you have any music that kind of sounds somewhere around any of that stuff I'm always open for a listen! Also kyuss I kinda cool.  
p1492
aVNever mind about not liking Coal Chamber or whataver, man. You haven't sounded like an asshole at all during the conversation. \u000a\u000aOn Xzibit... I think he's pretty good at what he does, though I'm not too much intro his style of music. I generally don't dig the gangsta cliches too much and don't think too much of gangsta rap in general, but the big names like Xzibit that actually put something solid with clever lyrics here and there to help build up the whole thing do have my respect. I just listened to some of his songs, and they're quite enjoyable. I can also listen to snoop dogg and ice cube from time to time and get a kick out of it, though usually it's because I'm with friends who are into that music.\u000a\u000a2X has a strong rap element to it, or at least an influence on some of their less rap-ish songs. If the link didn't work, I'd recommend "Abuso de poder", "No vamos a ceder", and "Al choke". \u000a\u000aOut of all the stuff you've shown me that I hadn't listened to, Big Sugar has to be my favourite. The lead singer's voice really stands out, and the guitars are dirty in the best way. I don't know much about drumming, but I do like the way the drummer carries the whole thing. Good lyrics, too.\u000a\u000aOn Maynard James Keenan, well, him being a dick does alienate me a lot. I know one isn't supposed to listen or not listen to something just because of the way one of the members of a band behaves, but to me the case is too strong. On the other hand, I tend to defend my favourite rockstars til the bitter end when I'm a lot into their music. Tool's music itself has something that doesn't get to me, it strikes me as pretentious, like just being the overthought fruit of the band's work. Well, to be fair, most of the times someone dislikes music that is very elaborate, it feels pretentious, like the countless times any famous progressive band has been called pretentious. I listened to some Pussifer, and I have to say it's really well done music that I probably only understand on the most shallow level, but still didn't get to me.\u000a\u000aAbout well done electronic music, what do you think about Kraftwerk? I'm not that knowledgeable on electronic, and have mostly been getting into it this year. I still hate mainstream IDM with all my guts.\u000aI know it's kind of a lazy and noobish way to start looking, but i began listening to the "artificial intelligence" compilations by Warp records. I'd recommend anything by that label. Aphex Twin, Black Dog Productions, Speedy J have all stuck with me.\u000a\u000aOh, and really experimental electronics like Mouse on Mars' i also can listen to without ever getting tired. \u000a\u000aWhat's your take on dubstep? I dislike mainstream dubstep a lot, and there's a lot of "dubstep for connoisseurs" that I also feel is just random noise without any effort or feeling behind it. With time I've found some stuff that actually sound clever and with real intention behind it, specially Bassnectar. That guy has remixed several metal/rock songs, I got acquainted with his work after one of his remixes appeared on an official repressing of a Primus album. I do like dubstep remixes of metal songs in general, and bands that incorporate dubstep by their own on their work. Of course, I still think that many of the remixes out there are a bonehead mess. \u000a\u000aI felt like bringing out the dubstep thing because of Korn and their inclussion of it on some of their most recent work. I've come to really like that mixture, I think they pulled it off really well. What I don't like is some of the pop elements they've brought to their songs, like the hook in "never never". The beginning with the electronic sounds is quirky great, I like the breakdown, but the pop hook just feels like a flat slap. As you may have guessed, I've been listening to Korn here and there since we began these messages. My take on them is that while I'm super into their aggro stuff like Faget, Blind, Shoots and Ladders, A.d.i.d.a.s, etc. some of their poppped down newer stuff feels awkward. Getting current on the subject, what do you think of Hater? I don't know if it contradicts what I was talking about, but I liked it. I couldn't take the testimonies in the video all that serious, because they were a bit of a caricature of the 00's outcast Korn fan kids, but in the end I felt they worked in a weird pop culture way. The rest of the video  I found very very cool and cathartic.\u000a\u000aI've liked the Korn videos i've seen. Both the simpler ones like Shoots &amp; Ladder's and Blind's, which work mostly on clever shots of the band's raw energy, and the full-on cgi ones, like Never Never's and Love and Meth's. Thoughtless' video, that featured a high school outcast that vomited in his prom... that one was awkward. But all of the others i love.  Oh, and Spike in my veins' video is cool, even when it points at a critique that is kinda commonly said, the video is tight. \u000a\u000aAnd Freak on a leash's! That sweet 90s animation, it reminds me of so many good 90s cartoons. No to say the clever video itself, and the whole bullet effect. \u000a\u000aSorry if I got too sidetracked on the videos thing &gt;.&lt; I'm going to start studying to work with movies, tv, and documentaries next year, so I always have an eye on them and like discussing the subject.\u000a\u000aOn the last bands you mentioned... well, I think I've covered them all, except maybe Alice in chains. I think they're masters at what they do, last night I listened to their first album. I still have to get into what they've done with their new singer, though.\u000a\u000aSeeing that you like both rap and some rap-rock bands, I'm curious about why you're not that attracted to Powerman 5000's rap records. I myself enjoy them thoroughly, and savor them as a chance to listen to turntables and congas along with Spider One's voice, which probably won't happen again, as much as I think the turntables would fit right in, and that the congas would be cool in chill songs like I wanna kill You.\u000a\u000aSo I think that's about it. Sorry for taking so long again, and, um, merry christmas
p1493
aVAs far as korn goes I really only enjoy everything they've put out right up until LIP I honestly can't stand their new stuff, doesn't feel like korn. I enjoyed hater though, not a bad song all around and probably the only song I fully enjoy of their dubstep album would be sanctuary. Untouchables is still my favourite album by far, with good quality headphones they have so much wonky sound effects and such going on in the background you usually just miss. As far as their videos I enjoy pretty much all of them, it just always looks like their havin fun and doing them. \u000a\u000aAs for powerman 5000s rap-rock style. I feel like it's just... I'm not sure, extremely awkward, they hadn't quite found their sound yet, and while it is cool, it also sounds pretty brutual imo. Not good as far as rap goes and as far as rock goes it's pretty sour as well. I'd much rather listen to ratm and I'm not even a huge ratm fan. I've tried to listen to it and no matter how many times I listen to it, it just doesn't sound good to me. I can barely sit through a whole song.\u000a\u000aI recently got into a few new bands including "the tea party" which they are pretty awesome. As well as "the raconteurs". Both really solid bands and really really enjoyable music. \u000a\u000aI'm giving 2X a listen right now and I'll let you know what I think.\u000a\u000aThere's a local band in my area that's just recent starting, my buddy is the lead singer and naturally I think their pretty damn good. They sound like qotsa on heroin. It's really good their name is "the dead Fibers" I'm not to sure how much of it is available on YouTube. But for sure worth a listen. \u000a\u000aAnd ya merry ho ho Jesus to you! (That's merry Christmas) \u000a\u000aEdit:I mean take a look in the mirror not LIP
p1494
aVFirst time I've listened to them since "Tonight the stars Revolt!".  I'll admit I don't mind the song, but I'm not going to go out of my way to listen to more of them.\u000a\u000aThanks for bringing them back to my attention though.

p1505
aVMix of many different elements, very few guitar solos. Vocals can be very different, sometimes even in one song (like Zetsubou Billy by MTH for example).\u000aYou might see some unusual instruments (like bagpipes, flute, motograter).\u000a\u000aSeveral popular bands have a few nu metal albums and some completely different (Papa Roach, Linkin Park...) so you shouldn't confuse those.\u000a\u000aBut I do think that some nu metal bands are very different from each other, but I still like most of them.\u000a\u000aAlso if you see a lot of dreadlocks, it's probably nu metal.
p1506
aVNu Metal is Korn and anything influenced by them. Deftones were part of the movement in the 90's but began to fade away from the genre. Drowning Pool and Papa Roach had that low guitar rhytmic style in the early 2000's so you can classify them as nu metal.
p1507
aVNu-metal for me: Heavy, mostly sung and not screamed, low quantity of guitar solos, contains rhythm (as in danceable, move your body to). Metal all you can do is headbang. That's my opinion at least.
p1508
aVAt first, to me, Nu-Metal was a fusion of Rap and Rock. \u000a\u000aBut, the more I think about it that isn't what Nu-Metal is at all given bands like Korn and Slipknot who don't do any rap really in their music. \u000a\u000aI guess the best way to describe it is "Experimental rock." Nu Metal bands always seemed to be finding ways to push the envelope in regards to what you hear in a typical metal song. Limp Bizkit brought Hiphop and Rock together, Korn brought Electronic music and Metal, Slipknot essentially did the same thing as Korn but had more metal and less electronica. \u000a\u000aBasically, what I think Nu-Metal is, is the incorporation of various musical elements into Metal. Nu-Metal bands assimilate various aspects of other genres to produce something that sounds different from other types of Metal.  \u000a\u000aNow, whether or not what Nu-Metal does is any different than what other types of Metal do (incorporating other genres into their music) is up for debate. Maybe Nu-Metal is more extreme about what they take from other genres and that is what makes them unique.\u000a\u000aWhen I think of Nu Metal, I think of songs like [Nookie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTMVOzPPtiw) by Limp Bizkit or [It's Goin' Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0nyy6AcfY4) by X-Ecutioners. \u000a\u000aEdit: In fact if you listen to It's Goin' Down it seems to describe what Nu-Metal is: \u000a\u000a&gt; The rhythm projects "round the next sound\u000a\u000a\u000aReflects the complex hybrid dialect now\u000a\u000a\u000aDetects the mesh of many elements compressed down\u000a\u000a\u000aThe melting pot of a super-futureesque style\u000a\u000a\u000aThe combination of vocal caress\u000a\u000a\u000aWith lungs the gasp for breath\u000a\u000a\u000aFrom emotional stress\u000a\u000a\u000aWith special effects\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd a distorted collage\u000a\u000a\u000aCarefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage\u000a\u000a\u000aIt"s going down\u000a\u000a\u000aThe logical progression on the timeline\u000a\u000a\u000aThe seperation narrowed down to a fine line\u000a\u000a\u000aTo blur the edges so they blend together properly\u000a\u000a\u000aTake you on an audible odyssey\u000a

Vi really like the song
p1545
aVI like it. A lot of people are complaining that it sounds too much like Stone Sour, but I think that's not entirely true and not a bad thing anyway. Can't wait for the other 14 songs!
p1546
aVI did a bad thing by reading the comments on the negative one's youtube page. People bitching about it sounding TOO much like old school slipknot. So they released a song that sounds like new slipknot. Then people bitch about that. I think the thing to take away from this experience is that most metal fans are a pessimistic bunch. 
p1547
aVYeah, no matter what they do people are gonna complain. As Corey said on Twitter, the millions who can appreciate a great song are more important
p1548
aVExactly why I literally just left /r/shreddit 
p1549
aVIt's decent, but nowhere near as good as The Negative One is.
p1550
aVYeah I thaught the same. It's still a very good song but The Negative One is my favourite out of those two. It has more punch.
p1551
aVAwesome song, I really like it.
p1552
aVThis song is shit. The last one was good. It sounds like Stone Sour 2.0. I don't think Corey knows how to write a Slipknot song anymore. The clean vocals aren't the problem, it's the whole vibe of the song. There is a lack of energy, the riff is boring and the drumming isn't anything to rave about despite being one of the better aspects of the track. I am sick of seeing dumbasses blindly defend anything they put out on other websites. It's a boring track. However, the rest of the album will probably be better and this is more than likely the radio friendly track, a la Dead Memories, even though Dead Memories was far better written.

asVWhat makes Numetal that genre?
p1738
(lp1739
VI always felt like NuMetal was a bullshit term in the first place, as many bands considered NuMetal have little to nothing in common, for this i site Motograter and Lostprophets.  The misspelling and umlauts are probably what causes most people to not take it seriously at a glance, but really it comes down to personal preference, one person may be into Linkin Park and Dry Cell and just cant get into the heavier side, others may be into the more rap influenced stuff like Crazytown,there was punkier stuff like Lostprophets, and yet others like System and Kittie and gravitate towards the heavier side.  For me, personally, System was always a little out there into Prog Rock than i liked then, and lyrical content has kept me away as i got older.  But im willing to wager if you went through my cd collection back in the day you would seriously question my sanity on some of my selections, but it was all personal preference.\u000a\u000aNuMetal is just a hard genre to pin down.  I have seen bands on this sub that ive argued heavily in the past dont fit, but now that im older i know how broad and indistinct NuMetal was.  It was just a name to call the music of the day, because unlike Grunge, Hair Metal, and original Heavy Metal, there were very few unifying factors between the acts, nothing to define them as one and the same.  
p1740
aVi really appreciate the feedback. i completely agree with you on most of what you said. although im not a true numetal fan, it is an important part of music as i grew up hearing crazytown, linkin park, lost prophets, etc. now that i know what kind of music i use to listen to, now i can rediscover the music :D
p1741
aVMy personal favorite bands are Dope and Sevendust, both bands that started out lumped in with NuMetal and made healthy transitions beyond that... theres actually alot of good stuff out there, and the genre isnt truly dead yet, it lives in bands like Nine Lashes and Super Bob
p1742
aVYeah, all the rap-metal gets thrown into nu-metal, and I hate rap-metal (Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit), but like other bands categorized as nu-metal:  Sevendust and Deftones.  No idea why Sevendust gets categorized in here - they're just straight heavy-ass rock/metal.  Just some heavy guitars and great melodies.
p1743
aVnormally, NuMetal is seen as a fusion of hip-hop and hard rock, so technically bands like Linkin Park(before they sold their souls to pop music), Limp Bizkit, Rage Against The Machine, and CrazyTown were the truest embodiments of the genre, even though the term really started with Korn, Incubus, Sevendust, Deftones, and System of a Down, and to some extent early 311, all bands that i would argue never really fit the defnition to begin with.  Then you had great bands like The Union Underground that got swept up in the flood of bands that tried to sound like everyone else, instead of sounding like themselves and happenning to produce that sound.
p1744
aVMan, such a great description. Clearly I'm late to this thread but was searching to see what I'd find on here in the NuMetal world. Some of my favorite bands are Sevendust and Nonpoint, with similar sounding (more mature) rock bleeding out these days. Though, Sevendust has evolved quite nicely. \u000a\u000aI'm trying to think of how I got here from where I started. My first two albums I owned were Alanis - Jagged Little Pill and Savage Garden's first record. Alternative rock and digital pop. Then I saw a music video for Garbage - Push It and was sold. I was sort of a sheltered kid, in terms of not knowing much about the outside world, and watching that video and even listening to that record made me feel like I shouldn't be listening to it. It felt wrong, but so good. Then I got into Limp Bizkit, Alien Ant Farm, and Linkin Park. \u000a\u000aI know that was long but I really wanted to share. It's tough when people ask me what I listen to, and it's really hard to explain that I like these bands still.  Check out Candlelight Red, Nothing More, Dead Letter Circus, and Daybreak Embrace. Currently spinning those :)
p1745
aV&gt;Nu metal (also known as nü-metal or aggro-metal) is a subgenre of heavy metal music. It is a fusion genre which combines sounds, influences and characteristics of heavy metal and its subgenres such as groove metal, thrash metal and alternative metal with other genres, including hip hop and grunge. It is classed as part of alternative metal. Notable nu metal bands include Korn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Deftones, Disturbed, and Slipknot.\u000a\u000a&gt;^^^http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_metal
p1746
aVso alternative metal... but heavier? or softer? or with more hip-hopish drums? see this reply really does nothing for me.\u000a\u000a i feel like slipknot is definitely metalcore. in fact i think slipknot was the reason metalcore even became a genre. but that's just my opinion.\u000a\u000a so i move to the others on the list... korn and limp bizkit. two extremley different styles to me. linkin park and deftones really have that style in common when u slice out the hip-hop influence. \u000a\u000amy point still stands i cant seem to decipher what proper numetal is. 
p1747
aVI can assure you, [Slipknot](https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/slipknot) have nothing to do with Metalcore.\u000a\u000a[Metalcore](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/metalcore) started in 1990 with Rorschach - [Remain Sedate](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/rorschach/remain_sedate/), and the [Metalcore we know today](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Melodic+Metalcore/) started in 1996 with Shadows Fall - [Mourning a Dead World](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/shadows_fall/mourning_a_dead_world/). 
p1748
aVYeah, Slipknot started grouped in with NuMetal but quickly tore themselves out of the genre... nowadays i wouldnt know what to call them other than plain and simple Metal, as they tend to be a nice blending of all different breeds of metal, save for maybe Symphonic stuff

p1855
aVI listen to a lot of the electronic/metal hybrid stuff as well. I'd probably suggest bands like Fear Factory, Spineshank, Crossbreed and Pitchshifter. I'd also suggest bands like Sonic Syndicate/The Unguided and Silent Descent.\u000a\u000aWhat about stuff in /r/electronicore? It may or may not be to your liking there, though.

aVPitchshifter is definitely one of the most underrated bands from the 2000s. I love there stuff.

VRap is a big part of nu metal.
p1867
aVNu-Metal has a wide spectrum of sounds unlike many other sub-genres, which could one of the reasons its loved/hated so much. I know what your saying when bands like Korn and Slipknot sound nothing like Limp Bizkit. Your right,but, that again being said there very few new good new metal acts that sound the same. Except for the generic garbage bands that were looking to cash in on the sound. If you look at the big bands that survived the rise and fall, bands like Slipknot, Mudvayne, Korn, Deftones, they all have their own unique sounds besides some similarities on their first few albums. Then look at the other  good bands that may not have made it big but still make/made great music like Mushroomhead, American Head Charge, Snot, Nothingface, (hed) p.e, Nonpoint, Ill Nino, Soulfly They have an even wider variety of sounds and influences. Some blending punk, industrial, alternative, even traditional latino/spanish/native music into they're own unique sound. Then you have other band like Limp Bizkit, Bionic Jive, Stuck Mojo and again (hed) p.e who blend rap/hip hop into their sound and do it very well. I could also name Project Wyze, Primer 55 and The Union Underground but im not a fan, they're not that great, and they fell apart during the collapse of Nu-Metal. Im sure the ethnic background and environment have a great deal of effect on the sound of each band. (Hed) p.e, Bionic Jive and Stuck Mojo all hail from the west coast. Alot hip hop/rap comes from Cali. Limp Bizkit does seem odd hailing from Jacksonville Florida having a rap sound but than again an old interview with Fred Durst states that while recording their first album he was really into (hed) p.e's  1995 E.P Church of Realities with blended multiple sounds like punk,rap and even some jazz. Rap/hip hop makes up a big part of the Nu-metal sound. But than again so do so many other genres and sub-genres. Limp Bizkit has alot of metal in it just in different ways. Hope this helps..Sorry if I digressed.
p1868
aVTry listening to more Three Dollar Bill Y'All$. But I know what you mean, that's why some people prefer labeling Limp Bizkit as rapcore, not as nü metal.

VAt the time, it was just out there compared to most metal/rock out there. It mixed genres and sounds in a way that resonated with people. And the lyrics! Such dark lyrics, particularly from bands like Korn, Staind, and Deftones at the time the wave really hit...My experience with the genre as a fan is that you embrace the darkness, awkwardness, quirkiness, disillusionment, loneliness, and/or etc. that you feel as a teenager (although it wasn't all dark, I'd say generally the sound and/or lyrics tended to be dark for this genre).  I was born in 94, so most of this stuff I caught unto in the new millennium, and I carry that music and support most those bands to this day. A lot of music after nu metal was and kind of still is heavily influenced by it. Sorry if I'm just rambling here but that's what I think of when I think of nu metal ( and post-grunge frankly, though another genre I'd argue some of that got mixed in there with nu metal). I think of the basic guidelines rock/metal has to follow for me to even like it most of the time.\u000a\u000aWhy people didn't like nu metal? Limp Biscuit. Maybe some impersonators surrounding them too...Its funny cuz I love early LB, screw everyone else who always hated them. But maybe that's because I'm a little of a hip-hop fan too so the hybridization was fantastic for me when I was first discovering their stuff in high school. But yeah, everyone hated them and they seemed to become poster boys for the crappy nu metal scene. Korn was the largest contributor to nu metal along with LB but I think people liked Korn way more. They were more creative I think. \u000aI'm no expert, I was a decade late, always thought it'd have been better if I was born in 84 instead :)
p2024
aVI still like Limp Bizkit, can't wait for their new album. 
p2025
aVThere are dozens of us!
p2026
aVYea LB ruined Nu Metal. Also post-grunge bands did get lumped into the genre. The biggest problem with trying to explain Nu Metal for me is actually what is Nu Metal defined as? I actually had someone (doesn't listen to Rock music at all, only big bands and in general 30's and 40's music, my grandmother) though Insane Clown Posse was in Nu Metal. I was appalled to say the least. But when i listen to some stuff from them or other acts of the same area, I can see it. I mean when you look at wikipedia's list for Nu Metal (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nu_metal_bands) the bands are all over the place in styles. Machine Head just above Marilyn Manson?  Kid Rock, Creed, Incubus, Vanilla Ice (lol), Sum 41, are all on this list. I think we can agree at least some of these bands are definitely not Nu Metal. 
p2027
aVI think the technical definition is when you combine metal/hard rock with another style I.e korns flutter with Dubstep very nu metal but I can't really see sum 41 as nu metal... 
p2028
aVYea, decided to look it up on wiki. This is what was said,"Nu metal (also known as nü-metal or aggro-metal ) is a subgenre of heavy metal which combines metal music with hip hop, hardcore punk and grunge. It is classed as part of alternative metal."  It is still very broad in terms of what it covers. 
p2029
aVThat wikipedia list was one of the first things i resorted to, just to get a glimpse of what everyone (since of course, wikipedia is something that anything and their pets can edit and revise) thought of what really was considered nu metal or not, and it really got me scratching my head at a few, including Vanilla Ice and especially Alien Ant Farm (who i'm a big fan of).
p2030
aVYea wiki is not good for things. But as for the list, you can check multiple places and get completely different lists for Nu Metal. It's really wonky.
p2031
aV&gt; including Vanilla Ice\u000a\u000aVanilla Ice did a nu metal album.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-LNT1r6GRA
p2032
aVtbh you can say that all those bands had at least a few songs which were nu-metal in style. As for vanilla ice, he released an (really shitty) album of songs in the style, to cash in later in his career. 
p2033
aVOh wow Vanilla ice had a career? I see the whole few songs aspect but a few songs does not put a band into a genre. How would you feel if Nickleback did a Thrash song and then all of a sudden they are considered Metal?
p2034
aVlol yeah he kept trying to rebrand himself to fit into whatever seemed popular at the time, it was entirely awful. No idea who was paying for all the albums he brought out!\u000a\u000aTbh if you're going to go by wikipedia for the most accurate in genre labels then you're gonna have a bad time :p though I suppose it's accurate to say that they were all popular at around the same time as nu-metal and were probably bought by a lot of the same fans. hah I would love to hear Nickleback try to do thrash, that would be hilarious ^_^
p2035
aVI consider all of those bands nu metal. Sure, some are better than others, but all put out distinctly nu metal sounds at least at some point in their careers. 
p2036
aVWow... You are really a lot like me, in the thinking part, and point of view on the whole Nu-metal scene. And I'm also from '94\u000a\u000a... Are you my long lost twin?
p2037
aVI would describe nu metal fans as fans of music that aren't just traditional riffs/lyrics. when I think nu metal I think korn soad ratm and slipknot. They all had unique styles that weren't traditional to the normal metal/ rock fans
p2038
aVRATM is considered Nu Metal? Didn't think about that. I whole-heartedly agree with the unique styles comment, most of the bands of the mid 2000's sounded alike (I'm looking at you 30 seconds to mars, Fall out boy, MCR, Panic at the disco), this is also true for the newer stuff that I keep hearing on the radio. 
p2039
aVOmfg just fuck those bands you listed. Ratm talked about political angst and tom morello on the guitar really just bright a style that wasn't just rap/rock but gave it a metal edge
p2040
aVYES! FUCK THOSE BANDS! But is my statement true about them sounding all alike? Also RATM's Tom Morello and Serj Tankian of SOAD got together for a political campaign called the Axis of Justice, they want to get rid of the Electoral College. Really quite interesting if you are into politics. \u000a\u000aedit: more material
p2041
aVThey all sounded the same just commercialized poprock\u000aYea if only we didn't have the electoral college
p2042
aVYep, well Princeton actually did a study of the U.S. and found we are actually not a democracy anymore. We are actually an Oligarchy, or a country run by an elite class. Man I love being a Political Science major.
p2043
aVElitist with money... lets not forget the money aspect
p2044
aVThe word "elitist" is synonymous with "rich." That's why they ARE elite.
p2045
aVElitists are just people who believe a society should be dominated by a few. There is more than one way to rule a people because you believe you're superior 
p2046
aVThat study is bullshit, in my opinion. The took factors of people who have the most "influence" in our country's fate. That is because the "elite" who are "controlling" this country are the ones with the most to lose if certain legislation is passed. The average citizen doesn't give a shit about most legislation as it only affects corporations or special interest groups. These "elitists" are the ones who take the time to sit down and view each candidate as potential voters in future committee polls. If a district in PA is voting on a new Rep for the House and the old one was pro-labor rights, but anti-gun, the NRA will push to have this person removed while Steel Workers Union will push for them to stay in office. The same thing works for business owners. Once in office, the corporations/special interest groups are legally able to pay money to lobbyists to help fund a candidate in exchange for voting rights. We all could do THE SAME THING if we banded together, but we don't because we don't CARE. That's what annoys me. It's not that we are an Oligarchy, it's that the majority of this Democracy just doesn't give a shit.
p2047
aVYep, well said. But that is the beginning of the Oligarchy. I think the biggest problem in this country is that too many people "know" issues and they have an opinion on the issue with no more proof than that they guy on Fox News, MSNBC, or CNN said it. There are no individual beliefs in the majority of the country. Also as a result, our elections are not who is the most qualified but the most popular. Another problem with the government set up we currently have is that the faceless politicians in D.C. seem not to care about their constituents and if these constituents stand up against the current standard, they are labelled terrorists or the like. Some of this is because the one bad apple ruins the basket in most cases, but also this has something to do with the media in general. There are too many blind sheep in the heard, and it will be the end of things in the long run. It may not be mine or my children's generation but it will happen.
p2048
aVThe only distaste I see towars nu metal is on the internet. I have not experienced any hate or anything between nu metal and other metal fans. And I think it's because there is no real seperated fan group for nu metal, at least where I live.  \u000a\u000aI go to concerts almost once a month and go to Wacken every year and never have I ever watched someone getting shit on for wearing/hearing nu metal bands by "true metalers" or vice versa.
p2049
aVAre you in Europe? Things are a bit different for me in the Detroit, Michigan area. I almost got beat down in a mosh at a Slayer concert for wearing a Slipknot shirt. But thank someone, there was a guy wearing a nickleback shirt. Laughed my ass off then thought about it. 
p2050
aVThanks for mentioning the "where you live" aspect. I also am trying to bring that into the mix for my research as well, to see if there are any trends in locations. Where is it that you live?\u000aMy notion, from what i've experienced throughout the years, in addition to being a nu metal fan myself, is the fans seem to come from more suburban areas as opposed to big cities.. and growing up in NYC, that in itself is a tricky subject in its entirety..
p2051
aVThe fans are pretty much the same as other metal fans; some are nice and accepting of all genres of music, some are just as elitist as "true metal" fans towards metalcore and stuff. Tends to be more the former though, which is nice. \u000a\u000aAs for why there is distaste for Nu metal from the aforementioned "true metal" fans, it's because they feel like it's a watered down, crappy version of their metal, and has different origins so it shouldn't be considered metal at all. Personally I like both and I get sick of everyone arguing and being elitist about it
p2052
aVThe fans can't really be described. I have been to Nu Metal shows where it seems like the traditional metal crowd of nothing but Slayer shirts and the like, then there are the shows where no one is alike. As far as the distaste, I think it come down to the fact that Nu Metal is considered Rap/Metal to most people. Bands like System of a Down and Slipknot (although some of their earlier work doesn't fit this) don't look toward the rap side of things but to the metal side. I think what it comes down to is that there is nothing like Nu Metal, kinda like when Grunge came out no one liked it because it was so far-fetched, but over time this fades. I think we are seeing this now. To be fair Nu Metal really wasn't what it was before. System of a Down has been on hiatus for years, Slipknot is Stone Sour (let's hope the new album isn't just Come What(Ever) May redone like AHIG was), Limp Biscuit doesn't exist, Linkin Park really isn't even a shadow of their former selves. The only band that is still in the roots and trying to keep the genre relevant is Korn, and in my opinion, poorly. I can keep going, any other questions just ask. 
p2053
aVDeftones are also doing good job keeping to their roots,  their sound didn't drastically change over the years
p2054
aVNever really got into Deftones that much, don't know why. Saw them live a couple years back when they opened for System of a Down. That might be it, they were good, but not SOAD good. THEY NEED TO COME OFF HIATUS. GODDAMN IT SERJ!
p2055
aVUh, Limp Bizkit are still going. They brought out a (great) album recently and have another one out this year. 
p2056
aVReally Fred Durst is still doing music. i really thought that after the Woodstock incident that Limp Biscuit just kind of fell off. Hmmm, good to know. 
p2057
aVYeah, Wes Borland has a side project too, Black Light Burns, they're alright. 
p2058
aVyeah I was about to say.
p2059
aVWould you say that Linkin Park tried to evolve, and maybe even redefine themselves as a band, musically and lyrically?
p2060
aVYes, I think they tried to hard however. The fan base has been all over the place. It reminds me of Green Day in a way. Linkin Park, like Green Day, tried to get more into the mainstream, well radio play in general, but by this they lost a considerable portion of their hardcore fanbase. For me this is like Slipknot. I am a HUGE fan of everything from MFKR to Vol. 3, All Hope Is Gone however made me wish for more, it sounded too much like Stone Sour. This seems to be the problem in general with newer metal. The bands stray too far from the start (Metallica) and lose footing but gain it with "posers". I don't like to think of it that way but it is the easiest way to put into words. I understand that bands don't want to remain stagnant in their style and that people grow, but without your fans, especially those of us that have been there from the start, you get forgotten, much like that of Limp Biscuit and Puddle of Mudd to name a couple. I like a  band to experiment, but not to make it THE sound, I think of Path of Totality by Korn in this. Dubstep-Metal fusion sounds cool, but a whole album release of it is too far from standard.  
p2061
aVPersonally I feel that Nu Metal gets a bad rap with the "traditional" metal community due to its traditional sound of adding elements of Pop and Hip Hop to what was usually a detuned low heavy sound from a 7 string guitar.  \u000aFortunetly I was in Jr High and High School during that time so I was loving the wave of Nu Metal bands coming out.  Slipknot, KoRn, MUSHROOMHEAD, Static X, Linkin Park (pre suck period) Sevendust, and the list can go on and on.  Yes I do consider RATM Nu Metal. \u000a\u000aSo short answer, the hate comes from Too much Pop and Hip Hop for the metal crowd, too much Metal for the mainstream hip hop and pop crowd.  The market just got over saturated in the late nineties early 2000's.  But as a teenager then with serious family issues, god I loved it.
p2062
aVDon't care about other fans and don't care what any other genre thinks about nu metal really.  Nu metal is pretty refined and well produced.  I still love Limp bizkit's music - wes borland is amazing.
p2063
aVTo be honest, in my opinion, people see it as a bit 'edgy' compared to other sub-genres of metal and rock. I'm not the type of person to follow music because of it's factors such as 'coolness', or 'edgyness', and I certainly don't care about what people think of my music taste. Some people are very elitist towards their music taste, and Nu-metal is something that seems to be 'outdated' in music these days, so I understand why people don't really like it, but that's their opinion, and I still don't care. \u000a\u000aI have listened to nu-metal a bit less recently, but that's just because I like exploring music. Nothing against the music. 
p2064
aVI feel Nu-Metal derived its musical influences for a wide variety of music. That what made it stand out out and drew people to at. The same could be said about why people didnt like it. If you look at bands like Mushroomhead, American Head Charge and Static X, there was a very industrial kinda feel/sound mixed into their music. Look at bands like Bionic Jive, Limp Bizkit, Stuck Mojo and (Hed) P.E there was a big hip hop influence on their sound and style. But that the same time they had their own niche. Stuck Mojo had more a metalcore feel from time to time. Bionic Jive had downtune chugs a la Meshuggah. Limp Bizkit was more of a traditional hip hop metal crossover. But than theres (Hed) P.E who took everything from metal,punk,hip hop,rasta,funk even swing was incorperated into their sound and style. Snot was also another band that kinda blended alot of sounds together. Then you have bands like Deftones,Nothingface and newer Mudvayne that had that post grunge/metal thing going on. There was also a theatrical aspect to it as well. Bands like Slipknot,Mudvayne,Motograter and Mushroomhead brought in masks and body paint. All these things made up the melting pot of what is Nu-Metal. The musical style to the fashion sence was all affected. Remember the big baggy pants with the 12000 zippers and straps? These are all reasons why it was loved/hated so much. A less metal person could like nu metal because it wasnt thrash,death,black or traditional. An elitist hated it cuz it was washed down metal sprinkled with other kinds of music. I love it, but i enjoy alot of music so thats probibly why.
p2065
aVThe fans are thought to wear the same clothes as the people in the bands. Chains, baggy shorts,t-shirts, hoodies, eyebrow piercings and  skateboards as an accessory. There is a distaste because of general prejudice. People who don't like nu metal, generally can't stand the music at all and characterise the music's fans as imbeciles since only such a person could possibly like such music. People really hate Fred Durst too, and the content of the lyrics of Korn and the general sound of Slipknot.
p2066
aVI couldn't answer about the fans but I think the hatred stems from people not thinking of it as "pure metal" and "too mainstream" by moving away from the routes into a more radio friendly wide style (which personally I think is absolute rubbish and music should be judged on people's enjoyment of it not who else likes it and whether it makes it onto the radio)

Nu Metal then.\u000a\u000aWiki - Nu metal (also known as new metal, neo-metal, nü-metal, or aggro-metal) is a subgenre of alternative metal that fuses elements of heavy metal music with those of multiple other genres, most notably ones like hip hop, funk, and grunge.\u000a\u000aYou basically paraphrased the definition of the genre.

sVCorey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis
p2279
(lp2280
VFuckin hell man. They're both awesome. Korn is my favorite band of all time so I'm gonna be a bit biased but John really does have a unique and incredible voice, especially his range. His growls are waaay better than Corey's. Corey on the other hand has such an intense and visceral voice that you can't help but love. He has the most consistent screams out of any singer I've heard. But in the end I'd say John, he's more well rounded IMO.
p2281
aVCorey Taylor is about the best versatile rock/metal guy out there.  Jonathon does a great job with vocal melodies especially for a guy that doesn't have a classic good voice but Corey could even make a living singing clean.  He's got better cleans and can go harsher on the other end.  Jonathon does have the death skat though!
p2282
aVI pick Jonathan Davis because I'm a huge Korn fan, and I love his scat singing.
p2283
aVCorey Taylor for me, no competition. There are only about 4 Korn songs that I really like, plus some of his JDevil stuff
p2284
aVAfter seeing both bands live I have to say Jonathan. His live sets are incredibly good! Much better than his studio versions.
p2285

aVThey are two different beasts imo. They are two of my favs, but corey is continuing to improve and impress, Jon is not. 
p2290
aVJonathan Davis. Without a doubt!
p2291
aVYou guys need to listen to some metal.
p2292
aVwhat do you mean by that?
p2293
aVJonathan Davis and Corey Taylor don't really have extremely great harsh vocal abilities. Jon is OK but derivative, and Taylor is basically impossible to understand live.\u000a\u000aJon's strength, to me, has always been in the fact that he has a unique-sounding voice. He's not an amazing singer, he just sounds *distinct*. \u000a\u000aTaylor, on the other hand, has a strong voice, and his strength is in the fact that he can go from clean vocals to harsh vocals very quickly, even within the same breath.\u000a\u000aIn terms of overall vocal quality, neither of them comes close to most quality metal vocalists.

aVNu Metal isn't really Nu Metalish anymore. Look at LB, Deftones, Korn, LP, everyone really. All the major hitters have evolved into their own unique sound and the original "Nu Metal sound" has kinda been lost in that process. I personally think that's awesome.

p2473
aVI certainly wasn't trying to circlejerk, I did a search and this video has never been posted here.\u000a\u000aI also hardly think that this sub is going to cause anyone to have a newfound appreciation for a dead genre.  We are all here because we already listen to, or have listened to the stuff.

aVAt the time that I made my original comment, a post for "Blind" was still on the second page of this sub sitting at #30. Granted, it's a two week old post, but that's not a very long time in a sub this small. Posting these links is like someone going to /r/metal and posting "Master of Puppets" and "Enter Sandman". \u000a\u000aI do personally tend to see nu-metal as more of an era of rock rather than a whole genre unto itself. But there's plenty of active underground nu-metal style bands out there to listen to. /u/Mordrag_ posts quite a few. I just posted a link to an a very active band I follow called Hate Grenade.

The album cover caught my eye and I was immediately intrigued. On the song list I saw "Nightmare" and "Pain" and made the decision to purchase the album. One of the best music purchases I've ever made. Listened to the CD until it was unplayable, bought another. \u000a\u000aDefinitely check out their most recent album (I think it's from like 2006?). It's just about as good. Not as good as nostalgia always is. But it's fantastic.

See the link in my post above for an idea of how the finished product sounds vocally.  Anyway, glad you enjoyed Panicide.

p2643
(lp2644
VVoting for LP.\u000a\u000aFeel like this might be unfair because of the range that Chester and Mike achieve as two people, but they are dynamic.\u000a\u000aAlso, for the record, it's *really* hard voting against Infest.\u000a\u000a*EDIT for clarity
p2645
aVEh, I don't really look at it that way. Just think, Linkin Park has to have two singers to do what many other bands can do with just one.  Linkin Park makes it work, but it could also hurt them as much as help them.
p2646
aVThat's a fair assessment. I think it's just that when I think of them, I often look forward to hearing two very distinct voices sharing a song, particularly so on all the early material. I feel like the disparity has grown lately, with more "solo" lead vocal tracks (like "Given Up" vs. "When they Come...").\u000a\u000aSongs like "Points of Authority" I feel are the fucking best examples of how the back-and-forth makes them work as one (actually all of Hybrid Theory plays this up perfectly). It's almost like the mood of the song seamlessly shifts back and forth between their verses. They complement each other really fucking well.
p2647
aVVoting for LP. Chester is just amazing. And even though I love Papa Roach, I can't stand Last Resort. The rest of Infest is awesome, I just hate that song.
p2648
aVGotta agree with that. \u000a\u000aInfest killed, but "Last Resort" doesn't quite stand the test of time. "Snakes", "Dead Cell", "Never Enough", "Between Angels..." however, are all sooo good.\u000a\u000aChester is great; as a big STP fan too I'm really torn about the current situation, but if Scott's gotta go, Chester is a surprisingly good replacement. Shinoda really gets me though man, and as amazing as HT and Meteora are, some of his verses on the more recent... uh, "different" albums were fucking unreal ("Bleed it Out" and "When They Come for Me" REALLY pop).
p2649
aVInfest is still my favorite Papa Roach album, with Lovehatetradgedy close behind. Everything off Infest kills, but Last Resort reminds me of my awkward 5th grade experience. It got old really fast \u000a\u000aAnd Chester is surprisingly a good fit for STP. I thought his voice would be too high but he's right on point. And Mike is awesome, extremely underrated as a serious MC. Some songs that stick out to me are Reading My Eyes and Burn It Down

VInfected Rain. You might like Straight Line Stitch also.\u000a\u000aEdit to add to this (and they're not necessarily nu-metal either): In This Moment (they're pretty mainstream now so I don't know how you *wouldn't* know them by now), Halestorm, Amaranthe (power metal, 1 female and 2 male singers), Butcher Babies (they suck though; they only sell records because their singers look like porn stars), Nightwish, Lacuna Coil (both beauty/beast style vocals, NW is more operatic while LC is more active rock). 
p2712
aVStraight Line Stitch for sure. 
p2713
aVI don't really like Halestorm, In this Moment and Lacuna Coil. I think Halestorm is the only one I don't listen to (much) anymore, because I find that they're a band you can get sick of too quickly. From what you said about them Butcher Babies probably won't work out well for me, as I can only tolerate bands who don't suck. I like Infected Rain and Straight Line Stitch too. Amaranthe, however blew me away. I think they're more tech-metal, but that didn't stop me from liking them. They have some songs that make me think of 80s pop at certain parts, and I personally think that's awesome.\u000a\u000a*^Jesus ^Christ ^this ^felt ^like ^I ^was ^reviewing ^at ^certain ^points.*

aVWithin Temptation\u000a\u000aHuntress\u000a\u000aArch Enemy (maybe not nu-metal)

I'll check out the other two later.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Just checked out Huntress and Within Temptation. Huntress sounds a bit like Metallica or Judas Priest, but with the vocals of a girl. Meanwhile, like the other bands you guys suggested, Within Temptation blows me away. I cannot compare them to any other band that I know of, but if I have to I would say Dream Theater because of the way the synth is.
p2732
aVIf you liked Within Temptation (and I see you liked Amaranthe), you may like Epica. Not nu-metal, but an excellent band nonetheless

[Icon for Hire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_S9VvJM1PI) is awesome. Their breakdowns seal the deal. They kinda blur the lines between mainstream rock, nu-metal, punk, rock, pop and electronica. I just love those bands that take it all and make you bang your head to a steady, amazing groove.\u000a\u000aThese guys may be out there (System of a Down-ish, to me), but [Twelve Foot Ninja is awesome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ST85Sui43Q).\u000a\u000aPerhaps my definition of Nu-metal is pushing the envelope?

I really like their new sound and can't wait for the new CD to drop.

aVit's simple, the bass. \u000aDubstep is all about the bass, it's the bass that wobbles, in this song it's just some effects.

I found them by searching for some other bands tracks back in 2000 (thanks Napster) and stumbled across all the tracks from Strait Up and of course Absent, which remains one of my favorite tunes by them. I was 13 at the time and this felt like the perfect mix of aggressive and manic vocals I could identify with. I don't think I have or ever will hear another band quite like this. RIP Lynn.

My favorite Stone Sour album is probably Audio Secrecy. \u000a\u000aThe new Slipknot album has taken way too long. The last one was decent but my favorite is the original self-titled. If the album is good, they can take all the time they need. I really just want them to tour again.

aVI think House of Gold &amp; Bones was great, but part 2 was better. Yes, it has been too long since the last Slipknot studio album. The last one was in 2008, now the new one's scheduled for 2015 because Joey said he's going on tour with Scar the Martyr, Corey and Jim are touring with Stone Sour, and everyone else is writing, so it's been delayed for a year. Though I heard from Clown that they may release a couple singles towards the end of next year, so there's some hope there...

aVMetalcore can be really good, but most bands in the genre seem so alike to one another. To me it seems like every metalcore band uses the same formula and never dares to distinguish themselves in any way. \u000a\u000aBut what I dislike the most about metalcore is the ridiculous try-hard, heavy sound they try to create, and I also can't stand how every metalcore band these days loves to overproduce their music so much that every drum beat feels like a needle poking your eardrum.\u000a\u000aThat being said, there are still some amazing metalcore releases out there. Waking The Fallen by Avenged Sevenfold is one of my all time favorite albums, and I also like Chimaira, and even early MCR.

aVEvery Time I Die is the greatest band on the planet in any genre.

p3105
aVIt can be good. I'm a fan of Haste The Day and Atreyu. I also like Emmure, but they're deathcore.
p3106
aVi agree, my cousins really into metalcore and all these bands sound the same to me. And he knows they do, i tolled him "man, i cant tell the difference between all these bands you just showed me" and he said "yeeaah... i know" 
p3107
aVI personally enjoy metalcore and listen to it more than any other genre. But you're right, a lot of it tends to cling to a similar style and starts to get annoyingly repetitive after you hear the same elements over and over again in completely different bands.\u000aJust like in any genre, though, you might have to do so e searching before you find something unique and enjoyable.
p3108
aVAtreyu, All That Remains, Bullet for my Valentine, early MCR,  and even Avenged Sevenfold are all examples of awesome metalcore bands. I think metalcore is more like numetal than anything. Both genres have a lot of crappy bands thrown in the mix which all have the same exact sound. But if you sift through all that, you can find some really good music.
p3109
aVThe only good ones are the devil wears prada, a day to remember, and atreyu.

p3187
aVThis song...\u000a\u000aRewind back to 2003-ish. I'm sitting in the car, waiting on someone. The keys are in the ignition, and, since the parents aren't here, I can listen to whatever I want. Taking full advantage of their absence, I tune in to the local rock station. For a little bit, the music is "meh" - mostly stuff I've heard before or older rock.\u000a\u000aBut then, out of nowhere, the illest song hits the air waves. The guitar intro almost slipped by before I noticed it; but then the drums kick in, and I know this is going to be good. Bumping up the volume a bit, I am stunned as the bass kicks in; this is unlike anything I've ever heard before. The singing starts, and I like what I'm hearing. A lot. Not only does it sound awesome, but I can truly relate to these lyrics; I *live* this song. My mind is blown. This is unlike anything I've ever heard before. I continue to listen will full attention, dying to hear every second that follows, but then, mid-song,\u000a\u000a*--Complete Silence--*\u000a\u000aThe silence continues for a little bit, and, thoroughly confused, I frantically check the radio: keys are in, station is tuned, volume is up - what is going on!?\u000a\u000a*--Sweet guitar intro; Wicked Drums; Bass pounding, resonating within my chest--*\u000a\u000aThe song starts over. From the beginning. This was meant to be.\u000a\u000aThe song plays again, from the beginning and (this time) to the end. It's the best thing I've ever heard, and ends up becoming my favorite song. It gets me through 10th grade, and, eventually, through graduation and into college.\u000a\u000aTo this day it's *still* one of (if not my) favorite songs.\u000a\u000a**TL;DR** - I love this song; it's possibly my favorite song of all time.

aVI don't think there will be very many successors within nu metal. Metalcore is what's popular now, I think Nu Metal is basically a ~20 year phase that is now giving way to metalcore and whatever other -core genres. That's not to say it has died completely, but I don't think we're going to see any more new bands that can replicate what bands like SOAD, Slipknot, Korn etc did
p3319
aVi will.
p3320
aVI hate to say it, but at the moment: nobody. Why? The current trend is metalcore or other *core genres, especially deathcore because everybody is trying to out br00tal each other these days. It's going to be a while before a young crowd creates a popular scene with the cross-genre experimentation that nu-metal brought on.\u000a\u000aEverything has its phase. The base is of nu-metal hasn't truly died, but basically the only ones that care are the people that connected with it when it reached its maximum exposure. \u000a\u000aI am still constantly in search of new nu-metal style bands. They're out there, but they are few and far to be found.

aVAgreed on 36. I find taproot to be quintessential nu metal. Primer too, but not necessarily good by metal.
p3365
aVI've actually always liked Primer 55. Even got to see them recently (mainly it's just the guitarist keeping it going).

p3371
aValso [shuvel](http://youtu.be/PcOO9lPWtaM)
p3372
aVYeah I know about shuvel. I originally opted out of including them because some of the Nu-Metal fans really look down on them. Other than the demo-level quality of their sound, I really liked them. I remember seeing them live ages ago and I even still have their original CD somewhere.
p3373
aVTotally agree about the sound. But I still played the shit out of that cd
p3374
aVGood list so far, although missing:\u000a\u000aRelative Ash, Pulse Ultra, Crossbreed, Factory 81
p3375
aVI love Crossbreed, I just don't think of them as nu-metal. I think they're more like an industrial band. 
p3376
aVI'm glad to see this list and all of the suggestions. Always looking for stuff I haven't heard before. Also you may want to considers Dirty Wormz though they do lean a little more toward the rap side of it.
p3377
aVI love Dirty Wormz, but they're not as close to what I'm looking for. They're more of a rapcore band. I'm trying to find bands that are more genuinely representative of the rock/metal aspect of the genre.

p3384
aVMudvayne and Coal Chamber are probably the closest to that sound. Others that are similar but a bit more under the radar are Flaw, Snot and 40 Below Summer.
p3385
aVI love snot but don't think they sound like korn. The other suggestions are solid, though.

aVFlaw is really nice, though it doesnt sound that similar to KoRn, it is this a very nice Band. Thanks!
p3387
aVAdema or Ill Niño. IIRC Adema was fronted by Jon Davis' half brother. 
p3388
aVCorrect, Mark Chavez who was the previous lead vocalist of Adema is his half brother. Adema have a great sound and I would say it is very similar to Korn.
p3389
aVAdema sounds, from just listening to two songs, really nice and, as you said, very similar to KoRn. Thanks!

aVMy THEORY is during this time when the band really was having lineup issues, Jonathan Davis made up for it by having a bunch of supporting members on stage, his way trying to convey KoRn as a band was bigger as a whole, then the original 5 members.\u000a\u000aBut that 2nd drummer really was not needed at all.
p3554
aVI believe they took inspiration from SLipknot. It's percussion to add that extra layer I guess, on some tracks it works well I think or it might just be a gimmick.

I think he has shown more ability to evolve and change over the years. Death Trip and Machine are different than Shadow Zone is different than Start a war and Cult of Static.

aVDon't think they have songs heavier than this. But if you want to hear more I would recommend  \u000a[Between angels and insects](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxdPnBr48Hk),  \u000a[Last resort](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhJ6bE4z5vs)

aVNah, their heavist shit is the last song on this album.

VThis made my week and probably my month. I don't know why but it just hits home. It's really KoRn. I waited so long to feel the feeling of "KoRn". Almost feels like regaining one of my closest friends.

aVI saw them play last year and actually enjoyed it.

VFucking awesome!
p3705
aVI am not really a total fan of the beastie boys but there is no denying that this is awesome
p3706
aVI was in college after Sabotage came out. It was as awesome and as much of a mosh as anything I listened to at the time. You'd be at a frat party and 50+ dudes would be jumping up and down in unison. It was a rush.\u000a\u000aBe sure to watch the video to the end. That circle pit they got going is insane.
p3707
aVAWESOME PERFORMANCE! Korn and Slipknot should do this more often.
p3708
aVI really hope Jonathan sings this.  Jonathan's voice is the best voice I've ever heard for just about anything.  Pretty sure he could even sing Thrash and sound amazing, and we already know he sounds amazing singing even slower calmer songs, such as Blue Monday.

p3715
aVMessage the video uploader and ask them? Chance is they chose the song. Might be a local band or something.
p3716
aVSomeone left a message in the comments. I tried messaging direct, but last thing they posted was 5 months ago!

aVInject my brain with DOPE! I survive.
p3734
aVAs a high schooler, I appreciated this song for the lyrics and the general "fuck you" that went along with liking Dope. Nowadays, it's more about how good the music sounds. Seriously, the recording/production on American Apathy is incredible
