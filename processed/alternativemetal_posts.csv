The Louder Than Love concert too! cd &amp; dvd! I've got both on video and even ripped from video to dvd but it needs an official remastering re-release."
"Soundgarden - Mind Riot [Motorvision 1992] [Fullscreen 720p] (x-post from r/Soundgarden)","You sound just like my buddy Drew. He's been wanting all of those remastered for ages. I'm hoping one day we will get our hands on all of it. I feel like the band is picking up more momentum lately which is why I love seeing fans interact on social media and groups. I know they take a lot of inspiration from peeps like us. "
"Soundgarden - Mind Riot [Motorvision 1992] [Fullscreen 720p] (x-post from r/Soundgarden)","Yeah, I would hope that all the social sites/ fans, etc. help push them forward. Speaking of the Louder Than Love concert video, they actually released it on cd and it had more songs on it. But it was only sent to radio stations, never a commercial release. I found a copy on ebay a long time ago, snagged it for like $60.00. I burned several copies and turned around and sold the original on ebay for $200.00!!!"

"Eighteen Visions - Our Darkest Days","I really like the sound and riffs of guitar and drums in this song. Realization in general in great.
I listened to other songs from this album but didn't like them as much as this one.
Would be great to hear more stuff like this."
