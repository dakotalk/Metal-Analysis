"Panopticon - Where Mountains Pierce The Sky - [12:42]","I got this album (Roads to the North) recommended by a friend the other day and was immediately impressed. It's a kind of bluegrass-infused post-black metal. [Capricious Miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SIbKRZFmYU) is perhaps the proggiest song on the album but it's also part of a three-song cycle and I believe it sounds even better when listened to in that context."
"Panopticon - Where Mountains Pierce The Sky - [12:42]","The album before this one is really good too. It's called Kentucky and it's about the [Harlan County War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_County_War).

Edit: [Here's a fantastic track from Kentucky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eO2CUheXMfs). "

"CHON - Can't Wait",""
"CHON - Can't Wait","I think a lot of people expect the vocals to be the forefront of the song (which is reasonable considering they typically are and CHON doesn't usually have them), but I don't think CHON sees it that way. I feel like the vocals / lyrics are extremely low key on purpose, just to add another layer to the song as opposed to becoming the focus. The melodies are very simple, the lyrics don't differ much throughout the course of the song, and the songs don't seem constructed around the vocals. I quite like it- I think they fit their style perfectly (a Spencer Sotelo type singer would be overkill, no?) and just continue to add another layer of chill to their always mellowing sound. I can see how people would interpret them as boring or bland, but I don't really think CHON is aiming to be a band with a singer, just adding them into the mix every now and then."
"CHON - Can't Wait","Wow they have definitely nailed their sound. This Rocks."
"CHON - Can't Wait","Ok, I'll have to be that guy. I didn't enjoy the vocals in Ecco, and this song didn't change it. Chon has always been about cool guitars and drums for me. Adding vocals didn't work that well in my opinion, and I hate to say this because they're one of my favorite bands. But, of course, I have to respect their decision. Almost everyone so far enjoyed this, so this is probably my thing."
"CHON - Can't Wait","I don't think Drew could make himself sound more bland tbh. And can we talk about how damn boring those lyrics are? It distracts way too much from the incredible instrumentals. Semesky grew on me with Intervals but I dont see that happening here unfortunately."
"CHON - Can't Wait","Vocals aren't terrible, they are sort of ""soothing"" like the music. The lyrics are pretty awful though. Very generic love songy"
"CHON - Can't Wait","Never said they were terrible! Just bland."
"CHON - Can't Wait","I agree with pretty much all of the above statements. I also thought that while the vocals were going on, the instruments kinda took a backseat role which threw me off a bit. They were just more open-ended and spacious rather than being a forefront, dynamic thing like on instrumental tracks. It wouldn't be so bad if the lyrics were better but it just seemed too bland. Don't know if anyone agrees, but yeah."
"CHON - Can't Wait","Yeah, the same thing happens in Ecco. I really enjoy hearing difference in their playing, personally. "
"CHON - Can't Wait","I think that the vocals were fine and I enjoyed this song more than Ecco. At the same time I think it's cool to have some different stuff (because of the vocals), I still feel it's not at the same level of their instrumental tracks."
"CHON - Can't Wait","omfg

hnnnnngggggggg I can't wait for this record to drop"
"CHON - Can't Wait","Chon can do no wrong it seems. I love this track."
"CHON - Can't Wait","Goddamn I love these guys so much.saw live at the music farm and they killed it"
"CHON - Can't Wait","This makes me so happy"
"CHON - Can't Wait","It's good, and I really like when the drums pick up a little bit. I wish the guitars weren't so tame. Still really looking forward to the album, hopefully a few more songs that make me feel like my guitar playing is worthless... "
"CHON - Can't Wait","Just released another track off the new album! Lots of vocals in this one."
"CHON - Can't Wait","&gt; another track

Where's the other one?"
"CHON - Can't Wait","Wrong flair"
"CHON - Can't Wait","Fixed"
"CHON - Can't Wait","Even though I thought the vocals on Ecco were pretty decent I think that the vocals were much better on this track. They fit perfectly and didn't take away from the instrumentals but just added so much more to the song."
"CHON - Can't Wait","I don't know why but it took me until a full minute into the song to realize that there were vocals."
"CHON - Can't Wait","I hated the vocals on ecco, damn this sounds 20 times better."
"CHON - Can't Wait","Can't wait to get off work and listen to this on a computer with sound!!"
"CHON - Can't Wait","CHON kills its with every song. If you don't like this because of the vocals then piss off. They have fantastic instrumentation behind it and either way vocals are just another instrument. Drew's vocals add so much to the song and are mellow as fuck. CHON are going to explode and become headliners."
"CHON - Can't Wait","Relax man. Just not my cup of tea vocally. I've heard many people say they don't like dream theater because of the vocalist. Never told them to fuck off  over it.."
"CHON - Can't Wait","Seriously. And probably half the posts on this sub are people asking for bands without screaming. The same thing can be said for them, and nobody tells them off like that."
"CHON - Can't Wait","Was there any info released on if the vocals are in every song? I find them bland."
"CHON - Can't Wait","If the other track Sumerian previewed is going to be on the record then there will be at least one instrumental song."
"CHON - Can't Wait","I actually really enjoyed this, and it is different from other songs. The last song released didn't do it as much (even though it was great, just didn't feel new to ME)"
"CHON - Can't Wait","mmm"
"CHON - Can't Wait","Am I the only one who has an issue with their clean tone? It sounds like a shitty clean tone in guitar pro or something. That's what bugs me more about woohoo and this than any vocals. "
"CHON - Can't Wait","Maybe its just because I am currently in a long distance relationship this song is even more appealing to me with the lyrics. That being said the vocals aren't suppose to be the focal point I am guessing. Its another instrument to give it that much more depth and feeling to the song. Nonetheless this song is really amazing and will be on repeat for quite some time."

"Find a terrible review of one of your favorite albums, post it here and lol","""The amazing thing about Meshuggah’s Nothing is that in many ways it is an album that does nothing.

On the surface this has all of the elements that gave Meshuggah their distinct sound. The bizarre time signatures are here as is the meaty guitar sound and Jens Kidman’s unique gravelly bark. The production is excellent and contributes to a very clean sound that adds to the technical sounding nature of the album. And it’s heavy. In fact it’s a positively brutal sound that even many full fledged death metal bands fail to get without relying heavily on blast beats.

Though they were always heavily influenced by their rhythm section there was always a semblance on writing some sort of song which went somewhere. If you listen to the seminal Destroy Erase Improve there is a demented thrash vibe that permeates the album coupled with more melancholy moments (e.g. Acrid Placidity). There are different tempos and each song sounds like a separate song, with its own vibe and intent. Not on Nothing.

On Nothing, Meshhugah strip away any vestige of song writing. As a result it creates the impression of one giant monotonous off kilter riff that goes on for nearly an hour. The songs, if they can be called that, merge into one another to form one giant amorphous mass. There is absolutely no variation on the album except for the pointless waffle at the end.

Contributing to the monotony is that the album seems toneless and is stuck in the same speed through out. There is no real variation in the songs, the tempo at which they’re played, the riffs played or Kidman’s vocals

In many ways it’s like listening to a CD skipping on the same spot. It is undeniably heavy and it is technically sophisticated but it’s a mindless heaviness and an equally mindless technicality.

To sum it up in five words, Nothing is mind numbingly boring.""

I like writing, and don't have a lot of opportunity to do so these days, so I'd be happy to get into this in depth, I'm admittedly not a very succinct person. But wouldn't want to write a big ol' block of words if it wouldn't be productive or interest you? Let me know!"
"Find a terrible review of one of your favorite albums, post it here and lol","Sorry I don't write much and can't articulate well what I want to say but my hate towards Periphery's new album boils down to:

-Same sterile sounding master as Clear, which was like one extreme to the other coming from the muddy sounding mastering of Periphery 2.

-Songs are much more formulaic than Periphery 2 and many follow the standard ""intro-verse-chrous-verse-chrous-bridge-chrous-outro""

-Spencer's vocals sound really strained and unnatural compared to P2 (and even Clear) as if he's struggling to hit those sounds. Sounds really forced and not good at all.

-Related to the last point, the guitar + drum sound is way off and sounds shocking. The drums sound so artificial, like they were programmed in but also the programmer of the drums went out of their way to make them sound plastic or something. Really bad

-The instrumentation all across the album sounds far more basic and formulaic than Periphery 2. It's like they went from having BTBAM-tier background noise to that of a stock metalcore band like BFMV

-I don't know much about time signatures and what not but I missed completely any evolving passages like that of Masamune in Periphery 2. Every passage from this album is predictable and stock. Just one of the things that adds to the ""formulaic-ness"" of this album for me

-Lyrics are pretty garbage but I don't care all that much for lyrics plus I don't expect a band like Periphery to write decent lyrics so it's something I could overlook

All in all it just feels like a sequel to Clear rather than a sequel to Periphery 2. The mastering, guitar + drum sound and Spencer's contrived vocals make the album sound really unnatural."

This is great, thanks for checking back in! I actually agree with you on some of your points, I'll try and group things into semi-related chunks and format a lil bit, but apologies in advance for wall of text:

###Part One - Opinions on Mix/Master/Vocal Technique Are Unrelated to an Assessment of 'Progginess'###

-I'll get back to that heading in a second, just want to say this is an area where I agree with you on a couple points first. 

-**Vocals** - Only discussing technique and texture, not writing or lyrical content here. I am concerned a little bit about Spencer's vocals, like you mentioned about strain and force. While on one hand, I am absolutely blown away by the variance in vocal texture he can now produce (that was already being alluded to with the comparisons to Rody Walker on P2), it does seem as though he's relying on that mixed raspy cleans when he is up in his higher registers. 22 Faces in particular wears on me after a while, it's a cool effect that reminds me of like a [metal version of Jonny Craig's soulful rasp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0fCXsles90), but when used throughout a whole song like on 22 Faces it loses its emphasis. There's still many wonderful high parts (falsetto in Stranger Things,  Rainbow Gravity, etc.), but it seems, like you said, that some of the higher stuff could be a little forced these days. On P2, highest note was an F# on Ragnarok, and discounting the falsetto on Stranger Things, I think the highest full-voiced note on Juggernaut is a few Es. Not that that's conclusive evidence of loss of range, but perhaps. From the studio videos where Spencer discusses his daily regime of waking up at the crack of noon and then smoking and drinking coffee all day, we'll see how his voice continues to grow and change. Personally, comparing P1 Spencer to now is still an amazing improvement to my ears both studio and live, but I just love hearing all the different sounds and mixed timbres he can get. Same reason I love Rody's.

*On the other hand*, his diction has improved phenomenally. For the first time, I can tell what he's saying pretty much all the time. P2 was miles better than P1 in that respect, and Juggernaut is equally better than P2. I'd agree that it is pushing towards overly theatrical and over the top, but come on, it's a concept album about cults and murder and literally going to hell and back, it's theatre, it's Dante, it's Wagner, there is no 'over the top'.

-**Guitar/Drum Sounds** - I'll be honest, this area I pretty much disagree, but to each their own. It's odd that you feel they sound programmed, since this is the first album (I *think*, can't remember if P2 had layered some reinforcement samples on the drums) that the drums are completely live. Kick is huge, snare might have just a bit too much verb (but that's a matter of taste, really, I've always liked it, absolutely love David Maxim Micic's snare for the same reason). P1 being the programmed sterility that is the unfortunate truth of SD2. I think the mix is massive, absolutely adore the low end, like you said it's nothing like the P2 muddy-ish sound, but I love that. It's like all the low end from P2 that I loved over the self-titled, but now it's completely clear as well! You can hear what's going on all the time. Sure, we've moved completely away from any form of grunge-y mud, but they're not trying to be Mastodon or Nirvana. *However*, that's certainly a matter of preference, I can't say ""you're wrong"" if you don't like a mix, that's why not all music is mixed the same, so no worries.

-**All of this is largely irrelevant** - Personal tastes and preferences of mix or vocal style (we'll get to discussing actual vocal melodies/harmonies/lyrics in a second) have nothing to do with whether or not an album is super proggy or not. I'll give another example, I personally am not into the more traditional prog quasi-operatic dramatic vocal styles, a la Dream Theater/Symphony X/even Rush or anything. *To me*, it's just too much cheese, generally speaking, and if I'm going to listen to dramatic singing with a lot of vibrato and whatnot, I'll just stick with vocal lieder. THAT BEING SAID, I would never use that as a basis for ""oh, Dream Theater's new album is their least prog yet, because I don't like the vocals"". I know that's not your whole argument, we'll get to instrumentation and structure soon! But still, just because something's not my bag of chips (Meshuggah), doesn't mean I don't respect it or try to discount it (MESHUGGAH)."
"Find a terrible review of one of your favorite albums, post it here and lol","(2/3) 

###Part Two - Structure/Instrumentation/Meter/Lyrics/Other Aspects of Music that Have to Do With Being Progressive 

Once again, I agree with you on some of this.

-**Instrumentation** - There does seem to be less electronic elements or vocal layering than on P2. Maybe they're trying to have slightly less backing tracks when they're performing live, instead relying on the fact that they have 3 guitars to help set texture/ambience/atmosphere. I'm purely extrapolating, but since there's no guests on the albums, that attitude of ""we can do this all ourselves"" could be extended into 'guest' additional layers and tracks. I still thought that there was a ton of variance in texture anyway, with everything from acoustics in Priestess to using different ambient parts behind each chorus of Rainbow Gravity, even something like the gradual transition about a minute into The Bad Thing that eventually turns into the basis for the next section seems simple but genius to me.

-**Lyrics** - Well, the dismissive ""lyrics are pretty garbage"" being tossed out there is unfortunate, but hey, matter of taste. They're no Fair to Midland, sure, but they're certainly a step up from bland Intervals anti-establishment or The Contortionist SPAAAAACCCEEEE. All my opinion though, it's hard to balance telling a story with keeping the lyrics abstract enough so that they're not cheesy.

-**Song Structure/Formulaity** - Are there some verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus songs? Oh yeah (22 Faces, Priestess, Graveless. You could probably put MK Ultra and Hell Below in there too). 

But there's also some songs that start off like that, but then the bridge goes buck wild and next thing you know, it's 2 minutes later and you're *finally* out of the 'bridge', which more turned into a bunch of additional sections then was an actual bridge (Heavy Heart, Rainbow Gravity, Alpha). Ah yes, the Thank You Scientist method of songwriting, start normal, then double the song length with wild bridge expansion.

Then, obviously, we have the last chunk of even more atypically developed songs. Couple nested songs, with a typical song structure occurring in the middle of another typical song structure, a favorite of [The Mars Volta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pafNgzGRjFk) also was used a bunch on P2. Then we've got The Scourge and Psychosphere, which are fairly asymmetrical, they just move on and progress through the song and have a second half much different from the first half, and then finally Omega and Stranger Things, which I'm assuming you will acknowledge as being fairly crazy structurally.

*However*, if you go back and look at P2, there’s nothing more special about those song structures. Facepalm mute is verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus, as is The Gods Must Be Crazy!, Froggin’ Bullfish, Scarlet, and MAKE TOTAL DESTROY. Erised and Mile Zero have an extended bridge, while the nested song structure mentioned above occurs in Have a Blast, Ji, and Mile Zero. Ragnarok, Masamune, and Luck as a Constant are asymmetrical, and the second halves are vastly different from the first halves, which I suppose is why The Scourge and Psychosphere remind me of Ragnarok and Masamune. P2 has no longer developed songs to compare to Stranger Things or Omega. I only delve deeply into P2 because it’s what you’ve been comparing Juggernaut to mostly, I’d be happy to break down the self-titled as well, that album would actually fare better, it’s got more structurally complex songs, even if it eventually makes them drag on a bit (Looking at you, Ow My Feelings, you’re about a minute and a half too long, even though you’re in 10/4 time). And obviously Racecar wins, I’m not denying that.

*Lastly*, I think it’s worth noting that it’s not absolutely *imperative* to have a ton of wildly complicated structures to be proggy. Sure, it’s ONE of the characteristics that can be an indicator, but it’s not a be-all end-all. The Joy of Motion is fairly simple in terms of song structure, especially compared to AAL’s previous albums, but it’s still firmly in progressive territory. Hell, it’s a freaking manual for extended techniques and their applications in music, plus the songwriting itself is such improved, beautiful melodies and a great flow to the songs. There’s tons of bands in progmetal that don’t engage in super long songs with a billion sections.

-**Meter/Time Signature** - Juggernaut is wildly impressive to me in terms of meter, and here’s why: they’re smooth sons of bitches about their different meter usage. Periphery is moving away a bit from “polymeter over 4/4” that djent adores, and is actually embracing odd meters rather than trying to make everything line up in 4/4. Not that that’s completely new, P2 had some cool metrical stuff, Have a Blast in particular has a section (around 1:45) that’s in 9, and the bridge of the inner nested song is in 7. However, Juggernaut goes off the deep end and lands firmly in prog territory. Whether it’s the general configuration, like the fact that the chorus of 22 faces is grouped into 5 measures+3 measures, instead of 4+4, or the fact that Alpha is missing beats left and right, 7/4’s tacked on to the ends of phrases in the verses and the choruses. Or how about more specific constant meter changes? Guitar solo to Rainbow Gravity is structured so crazy [I made a damn chart to keep track of it](https://instagram.com/p/zVI3GFLN0G/?modal=true). You don’t even notice most of the time, which is brilliant writing. Sure, I absolutely adore Protest the Hero and CHON’s school of off-kilter meters that punch you in the head because you don’t know where the next downbeat is going to be, and I’m not saying they’re CHON or DT in their frequency of metre changes, but it compares favorably well to Masamune, which subscribes to the polymeter-over-4/4 school of thought.

-With regards to general rhythmic playing, there’s a similar amount of chugging on this album as on previous albums, additionally there aren’t any memes or completely irrelevant words in the song titles on this album, so that’s a plus!

-**Other Progressive Elements** - As [I discuss in length here](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2tf3hv/official_discussion_thread_for_peripherys/cnyx0xw), Periphery uses a ton of recurring themes over the course of the 2 albums, which of course is something that sets the prog alarm ringing. Also, the fact that it’s 80 minutes of music telling a single story is a prog lovers jam, even if you dislike the product or execution. P2’s trilogy was awesome, and this is like that but MORE. As other people have pointed out, there’s both lighter and heavier moments (or at least equally light and heavy) as have occurred on their other albums, resulting in a sonically, harmonically, and melodically diverse group of songs that make up the story. Is it “the heaviest, most br00tal album ever”? Absolutely not, and the product is certainly not quite what I expected after hearing the band discuss how kvilt it was going to be. Doesn’t mean it’s not prog. Of course, we need to address the ‘poppy’ elephant in the room still.

###Part Three - In Which ‘Poppy’ Is Not Actually a Pejorative Term, Despite Some Prog Fans’ Insistence That It Is Exclusively A Negative Quality


-Does Spencer write upbeat, catchy melodies over strange riffs? Yes. Is that really such a bad thing? Well, certainly a matter of opinion to some extent, but I think we can safely take away that blanket statement of “Poppy is Bad”. A comparison - Anyone can write a 12-tone song. Arrange all 12 notes in a row, play them in wonky rhythms, and boom! Rob Jarzombek (Note: I have nothing but respect for Mr. Jarzombek, that is mostly a joke I’m making). You know what impresses the hell out of me? The Contortionist writing a 12-tone song that [still sounds melodic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQgL1RuusvE). You think I’m putting a lot of effort into analyzing and writing about Juggernaut? Not even close to as much time as I’ve obsessed over Language the past few months.

I feel the same way about Spencer. It impresses me that he *can* write catchy melodies over the rest of his bandmates’ strange angular riffage (Mrak’s bouncy fun riffs aside). **I** could write angular melodies over angular riffs, and then no one would remember a single melody I wrote. It’s a whole nother beast to actually come up with an earworm with the instrumental foundation provided.

I too am not trying to make a blanket statement. Do I enjoy a ton of music that practically punishes the listener until they’ve sat down and really focused and analyzed it a ton to be able to follow what’s going on melodically? Absolutely. Mean’s End’s vocal lines mesmerize me, Fallujah surprised me, Persefone and Uneven Structure hypnotize me. But there’s a lot of the time where I appreciate having an ‘accessible’ melody, so even a casual listen can be enjoyable, but still have enough complicated stuff going on under the surface to be able to go back and delve into it as much as I want. That’s why Destiny Potato/David Maxim Micic amazes me. Do I see how the ‘pop’ inflections or highly stylized performance of Spencer would be a turnoff to someone who seeks to avoid anything that sounds even remotely like anything on the radio? Sure, I can even get annoyed myself at some of his theatrics. But that doesn’t mean he’s a shit writer or singer, just means it’s not your bag of chips. We’re in a genre that’s over the top about so many things, from aggression to visuals to range, I don’t think Spencer is out of place here. I don’t *like* Meshuggah, but I respect the hell out of the writing and performance of it. There’s TONS of bands like that for me, and sure, I’m ready to get pooped on if I say I respect BTBAM a lot more than I like them, but just because I don’t like a new album by an artist I do enjoy doesn’t mean I will dismiss it as “their least prog album yet”. 

### Part Four - The Epiloge In Which I Commiserate With You###

It *is* certainly unfortunate when a band you love takes a turn that you don’t enjoy as much. I know from your other comments that you do like Periphery, and just are less enamoured of the newest album, so I’m not trying to present a binary situation of “oh, you must hate Periphery”, and your situation is a bit different from my feelings about BTBAM or Meshuggah. Probably closer to Closure in Moscow for me, I adored First Temple, but the addition of more bluesy stylings in Pink Lemonade didn’t really impress me. Just that even though the newest album is not your favorite, feels weird to see it written off as their least prog album yet. People are probably bummed now that the whole band is writing stuff, and it interferes with the Misha-focused writing of the previous albums, and I get that, it makes some of the sections a little less cohesive. I mean, it seems *fair* to me to have the whole band involved in writing, but it certainly changes the product. I’m hoping he gets that solo album finished sooner or later, so that the diehard Misha fans can get more of the original Periphery feel that they crave.

Once again, thanks for coming back to this, I see that there’s already been an explosion of additional commenting, so I apologize for bringing up this whole situation, but I was in fact interested in getting your side of things more fully.

I find it really hard to hate on the quality of those songs regardless of your stance on periphery as a band.

"Find a terrible review of one of your favorite albums, post it here and lol","Dream Theater - MP2SFAM (Metropolis Part Two : Scenes From A Memory)

Dream Theater are a band of many talents and wonders. Their ambition has always fueled them to go to greater heights, and after the monolithic Awake topped the seminal Images and Words in epic scope and artistic vision, where could they possibly go next? Well, apparently the answer to that in 1997 was Falling into Infinity, which I still haven't heard in its entirety, but what came after that? I guess they didn't like the accusations of commerciality against them on that record, so they went with a complete 180 and released this, the most bloated and sprawling thing anyone had ever heard in metal. There is epic, there is canonical, there is planet-sized and then there is Scenes from a Memory, and all it really does is put me to sleep.

I mean, how am I supposed to enjoy this? It's like Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime multiplied by three, the most excessive and floridly proggy album the band ever recorded. It's boring. Nothing on here really kicks up much excitement, no matter how many notes they can play per minute or how many drum fills they can put in a four minute song before they stretch it out to eight minutes. There is some sort of conceptual storyline here, but frankly, it doesn't sound very good, and even if it were, it wouldn't save this stinker much. This album is almost impossible to listen to in one sitting, and this is coming from the guy who just sat through Tribuzy's musical torture chamber of fuckery. Dream Theater, I think you deserve some sort of commendment for that.

So the album starts off with an introduction piece, with the sound of a clock ticking and a man narrating calmly, telling us to close our eyes, take a deep breath and relax. Preparing us for the grueling chore ahead of us, perhaps? Well, whatever. ""Overture 1928"" is next, and it's another intro piece. I really don't get why bands would ever do this - one introduction piece is more than enough! To be fair, though, this is the best song on the album, with some rumbling guitar progressions and some nice build-ups. It's really all downhill from here, though, so grab your pillows and your sleeping pills and try not to hit your head on the floor when you go down.

There is really not a lot wrong with this that I can't say would also be wrong with the other Dream Theater albums, it's just that this one doesn't seem to have the emotional intensity of some of the later stuff or the exciting grandeur of Images and Words. I'm not the biggest fan of Awake either, as it just left me cold, but this is just ridiculous - it is so elaborate and mechanical that it might as well have been made by a fucking computer in itself. This has a lot of bells and whistles, and the songwriting is certainly complex, but it's too hollow, skimping out on the more personal feel that the Dream Theater songs I like have. I think another thing wrong with this is the way all of the songs are sort of seamlessly connected - this makes them feel much longer than they should, as they don't seem to have any veritable starting or ending points. It is easy to see the intention here, but it doesn't work.

Oh, and ""Finally Free"" is probably the worst Dream Theater song ever. Completely enervated, painful crap with some truly awful, awful vocals. Good god, this sucks.

This album fails to incite any emotional response, and so despite whatever nonsensical reasons people have for liking this, it's not worth picking up. Avoid.

Sometimes I think Prog bands have become too heavy and percussive in imitation of Nevermore, and then something like this abomination comes across my desk. Hakon are a UK-based Prog band, and I hesitate to even call this metal at all. I only review this because it will get promoted as metal, and so somebody needs to point out that this is in fact supremely dandified prog diddling in the vein of bands like Yes or old Genesis – except to say that would be to do a supreme disservice to Peter Gabriel and Rick Wakeman. So let's be clear: this makes The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway sound like Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk in comparison. This is so pussified that I cannot call it that without insulting every woman ever born. This is filled with pop hooks, acoustic strumming, and pop synth faux-orchestrations so candified they are embarrassing. You, the listener, will be embarrassed. I'm embarrassed just acknowledging that this album even exists. An album that is a pus-seeping offense to art."

"Find a terrible review of one of your favorite albums, post it here and lol","Death - The Sound of Perseverance

Here you have it - Death's last (and worst) album. Evil Chuck finally got rid of the little mask thing on top of the H on the logo, and in time, he would have probably gotten rid of the scythe as well if it managed to give him some bits of the artistic credibility he oh so craved. The amount of songwriting not present here is staggering; it's actually amazing they managed to record, produce, mix, master and release an entire album without writing any songs at all. Random changes in pace that have nothing to do with what was happening before, a now complete, total and absolute lack of good riffs, Evil Chuck doing a Dani Filth impersonation all the way through, and some of the worst shredding you'll ever have the misfortune to hear in your life are merely elements of the terribleness present in this album. At this point Death don't have a single trace of death metal in them anymore, so this is pretty much a full-blown extreme progressive metal album. Sounds bad? You haven't even begun to listen to The Sound of Perseverance.

Performance-wise, it's the usual Death. Basically, (mostly) everyone gives off a nice performance on their own, which turns into a wreck once everything is added together. The drumming, for one, is such a poor show of groove and restraint that it sadly manages to subtract more from the songs than actually add to them. There's no Hoglan here anymore, so what we get instead is some guy accentuating every nanosecond with every single cymbal on his kit, which I guess is technically impressive, but doesn't do anything to improve the songs. I feels like a drummer trying to play the jazziest beats ever because he would get bored otherwise, but in the end, they feel completely disconnected from the rest of the instruments. In short, it's bad progressive metal drumming. Instead of giving a feel of connection between the rhythmic and melodic elements, the drummer opts to rather show off how many cymbals can be played in the shortest possible time-span. I'm not completely sure if it's Richard Christy's fault for his lack of taste, or if Schuldiner asked him to be as loose as possible in his delivery. The only thing I've heard featuring him is that Control Denied album, but then again it also featured Chuck's songwriting; I'll throw a wild guess and simply blame them both for the mess present here.

Steve DiGiorgio left/was fired before this album was recorded, so he's not present here either. Not that he's missed, since he was mostly relegated to follow the guitars around on the preceding albums. Seriously, you would have expected Chuck to use such a good bass player in a more respectful way. Here, the bass takes on a more active role. It also has a very nice, warm sound. You can hear it thumping under the guitars at times, and it really shines on the quieter parts. However, those parts usually suck more than anything. Those middle sections of ""Flesh and the Power it Holds"" and ""Scavenger of Human Sorrow"" are complete snooze fests, and not only do they both manage to appear and go away randomly and out of thin air, masquerading their go as progression, but they contain the most extensive use of bass in the entire album just to be drowned out by Chuck's shitty, shitty soloing. What was he playing those with, a coin?

And that brings us to the guitars themselves. I'm not even going to try to make a case for the riffs, as they are a non-entity. However, if you want to know how they sound like, just picture a bunch of bland thrash/melodeath riffs with lots of sugar thrown in them, and some chugging thrown in for good measure. Let's focus on the shredding instead. It is easily and by far the worst soloing on any Death album, and it isn't even because of a lack of melodic skill, but because of a lack of pure restraint. Case in point, ""Voice of the Soul"" is an actually amazing track. It's the best later-era Death song ever because it isn't Chuck and company betting to see who plays the fastest, most pompous solo (and in his case, he always lost because he was sloppy as if he were playing with a piece of cardboard). That song works because it carries a principle of ""just write a damn song and don't get too cute with it"". Also, it doesn't feature vocals, but more on that later. I don't know of Shannon Hamm's work beyond what he did on Control Denied, but that album is probably not the best way to judge any musician present in it. He plays some actually decent leads every so and so while Chuck botches his and succeeds in giving his sloppiest guitar performance ever, and with a career like his, that's saying a lot.

The biggest problem, performance-wise, with The Sound of Perseverance is the vocals. Chuck's silly growls have always been Death's weakest point, but here he just plain out stopped giving a damn. As said earlier, it sounds like he was trying to do a Dani Filth impersonation, with a very annoying high pitched growl that sounds as threatening as, well, Dani Filth. It's a huge step down, because whereas the vocals on other Death albums are uneventful at best and just flat out boring at worst, these are downright obnoxious to listen to. Chuck maintains his ""do everything with exactly the same-sounding screech"" approach that he has always used, but this time said screech just feels like ear rape. At some points, he'll actually do this weird clean-sounding rasp, but that ends up sounding more like bad melodeath vocals than anything. At least he learned his lesson and actually hired a singer for his Control Denied album -- which is the obvious thing anyone would've done when wanting to write a pure progressive metal album. Also, his ""sss"" hisses sound horrible. ""Dreamssss ssssiiight eyeesss sss sssss sssnaakeesss"" goddammit Chuck you were not a reptile, you were a human being, you didn't even have scales.

This is all, of course, completely irrelevant once you point out the actual flaw in the album, which is the songwriting. It's obviously bad, since we know who was in charge of it, but whereas other Death albums showed elements of good songwriting deeply hidden down a sea of shit/nonexistent songwriting, The Sound of Perseverance's approach to this delicate, vital and essential part of making music is to pretty much not do it at all. You know how death metal is supposed to have a sense of chaos? Of dark, morbid riffs that hit you in the head without mercy, but that at the same time manage to find an order within? This tries to do the opposite of that. Instead of ending up with a bunch of songs whose inherent chaos gives you no chance to escape, there are a bunch of verses, choruses, solos, silly fusion sections and a myriad of other things just thrown into a blender and arbitrarily arranged. You could cut them up, paste them into other songs, trade them around, delete them, and nobody would notice the difference. There are awkward silences between sections, proving that their transitions weren't thought of at all, so a section will end abruptly to mark the start of another section that has nothing to do with either the one before, or the one after it. It doesn't sound chaotic, it simply sounds random; like a kid just writing his first song and tabbing it out in guitar pro.

There is one instance of good songwriting here, and that would be ""Painkiller"" (har har). Obviously, Evil Chuck completely mangled and butchered it and turned it into what I still believe is the worst cover ever. Those videos on YouTube of high school bands full of kids covering ""The Final Countdown"" and ""Sweet Child O'Mine"" provide a better listening experience, and in general are more faithful to the spirit of the song. Chuck sounds like an impersonation of Dani Filth doing a Rob Halford imitation. This is made worse by the fact the vocals are laughably louder than the guitars, which do useless harmonizations of the original riffs which didn't need to be harmonized in the first place. Then Chuck comes in with the main solo to completely ruin the original, doing some very sloppy sweep picking exercises in the beginning, and then turning it into a melodeath section that makes no sense at all within the context of the song. ""Thisss isss daah Painkillaahh"" No, Chuck, you're causing me pain, not killing it. Please stop it, it's mean. You are not Rob Halford. You are not Glenn Tipton. You're not even Ian Hill. Why do you do this.

Summarizing, The Sound of Perseverance is a horrible album. It's shit, and you're better off listening to ""Voice of the Soul"" on YouTube or something. Death fell so hard into the concrete below they managed to crack it, keep falling, and then continue all the way into earth's mantle -- all while sustaining horrible internal injuries. It's prog for the sake of being prog, it has terrible vocals, terrible shredding, terrible riffs, and I still have no idea what the cover art is supposed to be, but it's really ugly. Gladly, as far as I know, not many bands have gone ahead and started playing in this style consistently, so at least it stands on its own haven of awfulness. It is to be avoided.

"Find a terrible review of one of your favorite albums, post it here and lol","What the f--- is this. Seriously What the F--- is this.

Kayo Dot - Choirs of the Eye.

I was expecting something quite mind boggling from ex-Maudlin of the Well members, however what we have here is probably the non-metalheads of the group homogenizing the music ... either that or they just came to the realisation that metal isnt cool anymore, or with age theyve grown bored of it.

If I had to describe this I would say ""Post-rock noise with accompanying jazz/fusion guitar and the same sort of drumming used on the lighter/slower tracks on MOTW - Bath/LYBM and a random assortment of other instruments""

Now by that description it does actually sound good, but I think that these guys have gone past my point of appreciation, dropped 99% of the metal influences they had and said hey, hardcore and emo are popular now, lets throw in some random grindcore and emo twists in our songs to hook the suckers in.

So half way into the song you'll have a 20 second long piece of grindcore and then it will go straight back to the random experimental noise/post-rock and then at the end of the song the lead vocalist will start whining like an angsty emo kid about some random gibber that on the first listen was unintelligable.

There are some good things about the music, I like the drumming even though it doesnt really do anything, its full on jazz drumming through every song while most of the musicians just pure improv for the whole song, the guitar work is quite skilled, in fact pretty much everything here is of good quality but it was like a child that has never done a jigsaw puzzle before wrote these songs.

I apologise that I am not of these ""muso"" scenester kids with an art degree that plays jazz/guitar and listens to post-rock, noise and avantegarde music 100% of the time that thinks melody, structure and actual purposes for songs other than to improvise for 10 minutes while accompanied by a mass of other musicians just to make noises that create a fascade of atmosphere to overshadow the fact that this is a pointless song with nothing but filler and build-ups that lead absolutely nowhere.

This music is uninspired, it seems that the musicians in this band think they have done everything and outgrown their old style, and that the only way to retain ""professional musicianship"" is to create music that is abstract without coherence, with pointless buildups that lead nowhere to mislead the listener into thinking they've missed something. The bits and pieces of grindcore and emo are simply there to represent the uninspiration or passion for music that the band members seem to have lost and to hook in the scenester kids.

However there is no doubting that the musicians in this band are very skilled at what they do, and perhaps if all of the pieces written for this album were rearranged into something comprehensable that leads somewhere, with inspiration and purpose this album would have been alot better.

Maudlin of the Well - Bath and Leaving Your Body Map are probably my two favourite albums of all time, however it is clear to me that the intellectuals who composed those brilliant pieces of work have been led astray.

Summing up I give this album a mere score of 20 points for the skill of the musicians and the fact that some of the music is quite good - such as the guitarwork and drumming. Everything else just didnt quite work, and thus I am disappointed. I dont think this band should actually be on Metal archives as they are clearly not metal.

I'm sorry if I am not 'avant', 'indie', 'arty', 'original' or 'open-minded' enough to full understand this album of pure random ... I think it's just way over the top, good concept but bad demonstration.

"Find a terrible review of one of your favorite albums, post it here and lol","Metallum user review of Mastodon's Crack the Skye

**Fuckers - 12%**

This is it? This is the Mastodon album everyone is tossing as the new masterpiece, this revolutionary modern classic? This is what everyone is excited about? Holy fuck, this sucks. Fuck, I can barely even listen to this tripe. How is everyone else so enamored with it? I honestly rarely hate albums as much as I do this one, because I actually went out of my way to praise Mastodon’s last album Blood Mountain, which I still think is pretty good. But for them to put out this…it’s nothing less than completely inexcusable.

This is Crack the Skye, and it sucks so hard that I am inclined to believe it was made by a completely different band and accidentally released under the Mastodon name. I bet the record executives just forgot to check the tape; that must be it. This was a project by some no-name group of mountain-men from the Rockies; probably incestuous child-rapists without any kind of formal musical training. Heinous devil-men with blunt head trauma from falling down rocks and genitals swollen from having to pull out cactus spikes too often.

But alas. I cannot rest in realms of fantasy forever. Mastodon made this album, and it is my duty to verbally castrate them for it. Let the festivities begin:

Alternative rock choruses, obnoxiously bland guitarwork and unnaturally nasal vocals, oh my! Mastodon have conjured up something here that is so far away from metal that it’s hard to believe so many people are fooled into thinking this is some kind of a progression. Frankly, anyone who thinks this is any kind of a metal masterpiece or a progressive one is high. I do not want any of what these people are smoking, nor do I ever want to meet any of them in person.

The album kicks off with a song that nobody will ever remember after its end, one that is perhaps the most unmemorable song I have ever heard in my entire life. It is titled “Oblivion,” and I have to wonder here, how is it possible to make this kind of progressive rock so god-awfully painful? It’s some of the most wretchedly unpleasant music ever. The rumbling guitars and whiddly leads should be inoffensive, but they’re played in such a condescending, self-conscious manner that they become…vile, uneasy and despicable. The vocals don’t help. They’re whiny and obnoxious, and it’s probably the worst clean vocal performance I’ve ever heard in my life from a major band like this. Good god, he makes Ozzy sound like Dio! It’s absolutely atrocious. Everything he sings is specifically tailored to be as painful as possible. Listen to that chorus on “Divinations” – have you ever in your life heard something that disgustingly snobbish? It is sung with this horrible self-righteousness, this terrible “ironic” sort of arrogance; you can hear it in that sleazy sheen to his whiny rambling. It’s like they’re talking down to the listener for buying their album, for falling for it!

“Quintessence” has a chorus that goes “Let it go, let it go!” Fitting, in the sense that the song is pretty much a six-minute extraction of the band’s collective bowels. Completely disgusting. “The Czar” is like Black Sabbath or Pink Floyd played by morons who don’t understand the first thing about atmosphere and flow, and “Ghost of Karelia” incorporates Thrash riffing as bland and out of place as it can possibly be. The title track is stupidly heavy, sounding the most like the Mastodon I know and love, but also not being anywhere near as compelling or interesting. “The Last Baron” finishes with a whopping thirteen minutes of ridiculously boring, tepid droning and psychedelic vomit that would make Jimi Hendrix cry. It’s a dreadful song without any kind of entertainment value. Dragging, overwrought and annoying, this is a surefire way to show people how NOT to end a music album.

This is just bad all around; there’s nothing good about it. Sure, a few of the leads are pretty good, but they’re not very memorable, and they don’t rise above the sea of splooge that are the songs they’re submerged in. I just don’t get the entire idea behind this. The progressions are aimless; they do not seem to have any direction at all. The songs are ear-bleeding awful, being unbelievably pretentious in their delivery and also doubly not sounding any good. The music is just unpleasant all around, sounding dishonest, mean-spirited and just all around puerile, in both instrumentation and feel.

Frankly, I’ve figured out why everyone thinks this is so revolutionary. It’s very clear to me now. Obviously those people who praised it for that reason were praising it because there was never before anything so universally fucking annoying! That must be it! Truly, Crack the Skye is a masterclass in horrendous songwriting and aimless attempts at progression. I’ve never heard anything so wretched in tone and irritating in mood, so unbelievably boring and excruciating. It’s as if it was a dream – nothing in reality could be so senselessly offensive to my common morality!

…yeah, Mastodon suck now. Too bad, I guess.

My favorite part of the review is when he says, ""The vocals don’t help. They’re whiny and obnoxious, and it’s probably the worst clean vocal performance I’ve ever heard in my life from a major band like this. Good god, he makes Ozzy sound like Dio! It’s absolutely atrocious."""

"Find a terrible review of one of your favorite albums, post it here and lol","BM is my favourite Mastodon album, whereas CTS is my least favourite. I dislike CTS for pretty much every reason the above reviewer stated, they went for a more straightforward bland rock approach, and I can barely remember any of the songs(except for The Last Baron, which is a great song), the whole album is just a mash of forgettable melodic choruses, and bland riffs with arpeggios loudly played over them, at least that's how I see it. BM however has far more drive to it, and the really catchy heavy riffs they're known for, as well as some very creative melodies that stand out because they're used sparingly, rather than overpowering every riff. I went off on a bit of a tangent there, but hopefully that clears up why (a small minority of Mastodon fans) like BM more than CTS."

&gt;**Dear lord, when will it end? - 6%**   
&gt;**by UltraBoris**  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, this is Yet Another Blopeth Album. What the world sees in this band is completely beyond me: their song constructions are incoherent, their guitar work forgettable, their vocals either misplaced death growls or horrible whining. There is no emotion to be found here - no stirring odes to battle, no banging one's head as if up from the dead, no connection to be made with the listener. It's just... there. It is perfect background music - harmless and unaffecting.

&gt;So we start with ""The Moor"", which does just about absolutely nothing for about 1 minute and 45 seconds, before finally launching into some (relatively) heavy-as-a-motherfuck ... acoustic guitar! Actually, this isn't all that bad, and this would have served as a great intro, especially into the electric part that starts around 2.30. Holy crap, this is, while being about twice as long as it should be, is a solid buildup - add another layer at around 2.40, and some solid riffs... this actually isn't bad. Then we get some death growls - so are we trying to be brutal or atmospheric here? The dichotomy is terrifying. Then, some decent riffage at around 4:15 in, but something seems missing - maybe it's a bit of destruction, or a bit of rockage value - somehow this band seems too mellow and out of it for its own good. Even when they are trying to be heavy-as-hell death metal, they sound like they have been knocked into a coma. Throw in a little break at the six minute mark, then more death-metal stuff, before going into a little interlude later in the song. Nothiing happens for about two minutes, until for no reason the heavy part comes back. What a schizophrenic little song! It's nearly 12 minutes long too - somewhere in there is a decent 4 minute intro piece. The vocal passages sound forced and weak, and the interludes are too silly.

&gt;That right there sums up all there is to know about Opeth - too many dumb musical ideas. The riffage is just not powerful, sounding like bad Arch Enemy riffs, being played by a guitarist who has been shot in the ass by a tranquiliser dart. ""Godhead's Lament"" is more of the same stuff - including the obligatory clean vocals and acoustic guitar passage in the middle. Even when it is kinda heavy, the album is slow and plodding and boring. Black Sabbath, this is not. Also, the clean vocals seem to lack passion and delivery. The verse around 8:50 in is just so going-through-the-motions.

&gt;Benighted is a total riff monster. Well, it's not, but I felt that I should delude myself slightly in order to maintain some semblance of sanity, as this passage is totally and completely boring. It's a little acoustic piece, and it provides no rousing sense of importance. No overwhelming emotional value like a ""Waiting for a Savior"" or ""Man of Sorrows"" - this one just wants to drug you into a coma.

&gt;""Moonlapse Vertigo"" brings back the electric guitar, but again it's the clean vocals that dominate, with a lot of random acoustic passages too. Typical Opeth. No real riffs to be found here, just some meandering soloing... oh yes, there's the death vocals later in the song too, but make no mistake, there is nothing ""death metal"" about this band. Even the metalness is questionable at times - somewhere I could've sworn that metal was not about boring acoustic passages.

&gt;""Face of Melinda"" starts off with a silly passage dominated by the drums - of course, the guitars are so powerful that they could be dominated by a feather, but that is irrelevant. This sounds like bad lounge music - something I'd expect to hear at the dentist's office, or in the elevator. About 4 minutes in, the song crashes into recognition, and finally shows some signs of life. However, not too many - it is still boring as fuck, unfortunately. There is no definition to the songs on the guitar-composition level. No solid heavy metal riffs, in other words.

&gt;""Serenity Painted Death"" blazes forward at breakneck speed... well, for these guys anyway. I hope they didn't break too many bones playing at over 110 beats per minute. Again, it's not the slowness that bothers me (see: Saint Vitus for slow music done right), but the lack of inspiring me to act in any way. It leaves me flat out bored. It is unclear what they are attempting to accomplish here - the passages lack atmosphere, the solos lack clarity, and the guitar work lacks memorableness. There is no catchy riff that I can point out - no Kreator ""People of the Lie"" immediate headbanging frenzy, or an Iron Maiden ""Seventh Son"" six minute solo that is remembered note for note when it ends. Nothing. Just misplaced death vocals. Only at the end does the song pick up finally - around the 7:40 mark. That part is a bit discernable, but when the random faceless acoustic passage kicks in, you know they're done with that idea.

&gt;Finally, White Cluster. Death vocals in this one, over guitars that, again, lack any sort of force to them. The passage at around 0:41 is repeated several times, and none of those times does it appeal to me. Then that is lost, and the clean vocalist comes back to yell a few times - his voice is very horrible, very bleating. I just imagine a sheep being speared. The song nearly falls silent at around 5:10 - yes, kids, this is the modern heavy metal here. Useless acoustic passages ist krieg!!! The rest of the song does nothing of concern.

&gt;And I have managed to suffer through yet another album. It's mildly better than Blackwater Park, but still quite terrible. So many BAD ideas thrown into this one - not a single memorable riff. All hail the new metal!"

 ""This Is Spinal Tap - 20%
FullMetalAttorney, August 3rd, 2011



Devin Townsend's pedigree is unimpeachable. He's a brilliant songwriter and incredibly talented guitarist and vocalist. Some people drool at the very mention of his name, and would lick his boots no matter what he does. Much was made of the recording process, which involved symphonic elements and choirs and was simply a huge undertaking. So, the final heavy album of the Devin Townsend Project was one of the most highly-anticipated albums of the year. Could it possibly live up to the anticipation?

Put simply, no. It's a bloated, 71 minute mess, the kind of thing mockumentaries are made of. Opener ""Praise the Lowered"" starts out with some very quiet Phil Collins kind of stuff, then gets a little heavy. It's a six minute intro. The follow-up, ""Stand"", is nine minutes of build-up. Tension, but no release. In other words, this ridiculous opera starts out with over 17 minutes of intro.

The other extended compositions--the 11 minute ""Planet of the Apes"", 16 minute ""The Mighty Masturbator"", and 9 minute title track--are perfect illustrations of meandering prog excess. Random, disparate parts are strung together in endless array, few of which are heavy, memorable, or even interesting. They're punctuated by choirs, symphonies, synths, and I'm fairly certain I heard the kitchen sink in there as well. There are short parts in there that are quite good, and they remind you of what Hevy Devy can do, but they are rare and all too short.

Even the shorter cuts seem pointless. The 6 minute ""Sumeria"", for example, is a selection of random garbage played over the top of a so-so riff.

The only consistently redeeming feature of the album is Devin's own vocals. He uses his full range of growls, clean singing, and narration. The lyrics are injected with his quirky sense of humor, frivolity belying his deeper meanings. But lyrics don't matter much to me, and vocals alone don't save this otherwise laughable record.

The Verdict: This is Spinal Tap. If they had made a movie about the production of this thing, it would have been hilarious. Perhaps it is the work of an out-of-touch genius with a bloated ego and ideas bigger than he can pull off. On the other hand, given his well-known sense of humor, maybe Deconstruction is just a joke on all of us, to see if we'll just swallow any pill he prescribes."""
"Find a terrible review of one of your favorite albums, post it here and lol","He actually rated the album 3.5/5 but it's a shitting of a review

I’ve noticed something I do when I’m listening to Periphery. It’s probably not something many of their other fans do, but from my impressions, Periphery’s fanbase aren’t the most intelligent or interesting bunch. When I listen to a Periphery song, especially from this album, I subconsciously filter the instrumentation, and focus entirely on Spencer’s vocal parts. It’s strange, because many, many people do the opposite, and so often Periphery have been asked to provide instrumental versions. But I just can’t afford to have this barrage of murderous noise affect my enjoyment of the great melodies that Spencer manages to come up with.

Lets be honest, Periphery have some of the worst and messiest instrumentals I have ever heard. It’s not just the farty ‘djent’ tone that they seem to still have an obsession with, it’s also the masses and masses of parts that don’t seem to blend with each other, it’s the strange need they have for putting riffs everywhere, where maybe there should be chords or textures, but they just chug everywhere and everywhen. There’s no doubt that these guys are incredibly talented. Some of them, I even have some respect for. Matt Halpern is undeniably an incredibly versatile drummer, he can play nearly every style of metal drumming with flair and technicality (although his kit tone is pretty terrible), and I also have respect for him as an entrepreneur and businessperson, with his music lesson business and drum clinics (although I wish they weren’t so expensive), and then there’s Nolly, their new British bassist, who is one of my favourite producers ever. He has produced some of my favourite underground rock records, like Natural Tendency and The Holographic Principle, but I just wish I could find some respect for him as a bassist.

I’m generally not a fan of this kind of music, as my opinions on Animals as Leaders and the like should prove, and it’s why I hate it being called ‘progressive metal’, because I never know if an album is the great progressive metal that I love, or this messy and unoriginal style of making me cringe. Yet, above all that, I still enjoy Periphery’s music, and as I mentioned before, it’s almost entirely down to their vocalist, Spencer Sotelo. Sure, they have a good riff every now and then, like the lead riff of “Scarlet”, or some of the stuff during “Ji” or “Luck As A Constant”, but it’s covered with that vomit tone and so much damn compression that I struggle to hear it. And even their atmospheres are bad, the pseudo-electronic tones they put in are just so dried up. But, I still enjoy them.

When you listen to the vocal parts over the instrumentals, you really have to gain some respect for what Spencer has to do. Listen to any of the parts, and imagine putting a vocal part over that. There are no chords, no melodies, not even many rhythms to base your part on, yet Spencer does it so flawlessly. And he does it, basically, by ignoring everything and just flying over the top. It doesn’t mix with the music well at all, and maybe that’s why so many people hate him, but at least his parts are good, unlike those guitar parts…

But seriously, pull the vocals from this album and I’d be struggling to give it a score above 3.5/10. The riffs are sloppy and without defined rhythm or key, and the solos are beyond awful. Shit, some of these solos are from skilled players, but they all sound so forced and out of place, like the band has gone “right, solo here and here and here” and then played some random string of notes. Take the track “Erised”, which is one of the quieter ones (therefore the best), but both solos here just sound so unnatural and forced, especially the first one, coming straight out of a rather nice verse. The solos don’t hold a melody or idea for their duration, they just play seemingly random notes in a random order. As much as I hate to praise someone likeJohn Petrucci, at least his solo starts out well. Those first two or three arpeggios fit perfectly in with the music (although I’m not sure any of the last two minutes of “Erised” are necessary at all), but of course, being Petrucci, it dissolves into mindless wank within a few seconds.

But it’s thoroughly impressive how Spencer and his incredible knack for an excellent hook keeps this album afloat so long. I’ll be listening to a track, thinking “man, this one’s pretty bad, I’ll probably skip this next time”, but partway through, Spencer just hits a groove and sings something so absolutely scrumptious that I have to go back and replay it. Take a song like “Have A Blast”. The violin part at the intro is alright, but it quickly dissolves into some pretty hefty wank-core, and aside from a couple of nifty parts from Halpern (his sudden blast beat part is great), it’s a pretty dismal track. But then…

“…and it’s the thrill of life that enables us to grow. Locked in the spirit’s line, souls entwine to journey on as one.”

And then suddenly it’s incredible. I’ve regularly used “Have A Blast” as an example of a track that goes from absolute trash to beauty within seconds. And it’s not just the vocal line, during that segment I actually think the guitars finally fit with the vocals and the tone, creating a beautiful segment with a spine-chillingly good vocal melody.

But it’s not a single moment. The number of times this happens during This Time It’s Personal is ridiculous, nearly every song has some moment that redeems it from mediocrity, all of them from Spencer. The only real tracks that fail to have any moments I enjoy would be “Make Total Destroy” and the last four tracks, which I will usually pass on when giving this album a spin. I can honestly say that the only tracks I enjoy right the way through would be “Muramasa”, “Scarlet” and “Erised”, when Spencer is given enough front time to make a difference for the whole track. The melody from “Muramasa” is absolutely brilliant, and the thing that made me look into this album when the trailer was released (I didn’t expect much after the debut), but both the times it is reprised, in “Ragnarok” and “Masamune”, it feels weak and forced, and doesn’t even save those tracks from mediocrity.

“Facepalm Mute” would probably be the worst track here, messier and more metalcore than everything else, but then the chorus hits, and“NEGLECT A SENSE OF IGNORANCE TO ALLTEEEER LIEEEEEESS” and suddenly it’s fantastic. The hooks on this album are possibly the best I’ve heard in years.

“We are the dark, that feed upon the living in sooolid shadoooooawwwww”

“…if you love the guilt then let it die, a life left so clean. We’ll measure the price of misery”

“It’s noooot for meee to saywhatyouneedtobelieeeeve”

“SCARRRLEEEEEEEAAAAAAAATTTT”

This Time It’s Personal is a record I love for basically the opposite of the reasons its fans love it, and I know that full well. I can see what the haters are saying, this is pretty bad, but I just can’t say no to those hooks."

I opted instead to find a review described as ""ambivalent"" for my third-favorite album: *Frames* by Oceansize.

&gt; Though still relatively unknown to the music world, this Manchester 5-piece have managed to build a loyal &amp; fanatical following. Now onto their third album with Frames, the band will be hoping to win even more admirers. 

&gt; Oceansize's sound consists of multi-layered arrangements which borrow elements of post-rock and heavy metal to create a sense of epic brutality. Unfortunately though, Oceansize lose points vocally. Though you might be thankful to find that lead singer Mike Vennart doesn't show any glimpses of a half-baked Liam Gallagher, the wannabe American rock/emo-pop vocals the band cling onto are just as bad, if not worse. 

&gt; Even though Oceansize's Frames will appeal to many, it's also certain to dissatisfy many hardened followers of the post-rock &amp; heavy metal genres. Overall; I would be lying if I said that this record is anything other than a little disappointing.

I have to mostly disagree with this man's impressions of the vocals. ""Trail of Fire"" and ""Savant"" are two of the most vocally well-delivered pieces of music I've ever heard, and I certainly don't hear any of the ""wannabe American rock/emo-pop"" stylings this man is referring to (except maybe during a few parts of ""Sleeping Dogs and Dead Lions,"" but that's beside the point)."

Which is freaking sweet. But I can't just paste in every album, as much as I'd love to. I need help curating a list of the best 1-3 songs from each album, so that then I can start working on a new playlist. Ideally, we'll update this one as new releases come out."
"Okay, /r/progmetal– here's the playlist I've compiled from our thread yesterday.","For the albums I've actually listened to, my recommendations are:

* The Joy of Motion - Physical Education, Kascade, Mind-Spun

* Clear EP - Feed the Ground, Pale Aura (sorry, I kinda hate the Clear EP but these two are the most palatable IMO)

* Language - Language I, Thrive

* Mastodon - Once More Round the Sun, Chimes at Midnight, Halloween

* Monuments - I, The Destroyer, Horcrux, Jinn

I obviously lack several."

I don't know what else to say really, except I enjoy their take on death metal and his song is interesting to me I guess?

This song is only a small taste of what this band offers. They only released one album, but its one of my favorite metal albums.

"Non-metal flair suggestion","I recently received a lot of responses to a comment I made in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2vsrfa/the_dear_hunter_the_bitter_suite_607/) where I pointed out that whilst I really liked the song (and have now since found a new band to obsess over), it wasn't metal. A lot of people jumped down my throat saying that there is often an overlap in interests that span across other genres and so-on and that posts like that should be welcomed. It made me feel very silly that I pointed it out in the first place, because I also actually like it when we spice things up and throw in songs that have this overlap, I wouldn't have found a new band if it weren't for it. So my suggestion is obviously not to exclude this stuff, because obviously there is elements to other types of music that appeal to fans of progmetal on the same levels of interest. So perhaps a new ""non-metal"" or ""not metal"" flair could be added to these submissions if anyone, for whatever reason, wants to filter them in or out? I suggested it in that thread and a few people seemed to like the idea."

"Non-metal flair suggestion","I'm sorry that people reacted the way they did, but this is something we most likely won't implement. It's too open for interpretation, unlike our current flairs which are easily distinguishable from one another."
"Non-metal flair suggestion","That's a shame. I find myself frequently wanting to post music here that I know will catch the interest of users because of the many genre overlaps and tangential sounds that exist between prog metal and the rest of music, but am usually hesitant as I don't know how people will react. 

And im not saying this sub as a whole isn't open to having posts linking to non prog metal songs right now, but it would be cool if it there was a way to encourage posts of that nature, as well as help people weed through them if they aren't interested in or looking for something not directly related to metal. "
"Non-metal flair suggestion","Well, I don't think you should be discouraged to do so. There are many ""success stories"" if you will of people posting non metal here and being pretty much universally appreciated by users (Snarky Puppy and Reign of Kindo come to mind as examples)."

"Periphery's Juggernaut Dual Release Debuts at #15 and 16 on the Billboard 200, Quite a Milestone.","&gt;Just because every song isn't djenty wankery doesn't mean it isn't progressive. 

Really getting sick of this lame strawman that every periphery fan defaults to when I say their latest album isn't as progressive as P2. The djent honestly has nothing to do with it."
"Periphery's Juggernaut Dual Release Debuts at #15 and 16 on the Billboard 200, Quite a Milestone.","So I also believe that this is a more progressive approach from Periphery than Periphery 2. My reasons are varied but primarily steeped in the song structures and their approach to the whole album

I do conced the pop elements you reference in the rest of this thread, but I will politely point out that Periphery 2 was very poppy. I could barely enjoy The Gods Must Be Crazy because of the overly catchy chorus.

I haven't felt the catchyness of Juggernaut has worked to its detriment. Heavy heart is almost a borderline alternative track, but it might be my favorite track on Alpha, if for no other reason than that it is simply a well constructed song. Its just good, and Spencer's vocals really kick ass in the track! They fucking use an acoustic as a layering track! No djent band has the balls to do something so against the very grain of 'djent'. Those melodies are so impressive! The hooks are not bubblegum but just well constructed. That's why it works.

If you want the quintessential prog standout track on this entire double album, look no further than The Scourge, which showcases an off time build of one melody and  and one arrangement until it explodes into an entirely different key and time signature with quite possibly the most head banging riff they've ever wrote. Spencer truly shines on this track, pushing the boundaries of his role as singer. He almost hits Mike Patton levels of crazy vocals, with his raw, visceral scream, off melody singing pattern and then growling sectional lyrics. Then he fucking releases all that build up in a full on layered vocal that morphs into a chant! All from one damn song! If that isn't progressive, then you are missing it. This is the Periphery I envisioned when I first heard Casey's fucked up vocal arrangement on Inertia, the first song they released as the modern Periphery back in 2008.

Yeah, this wasn't TOOL levels of genre breaking music, but it is a fun and explorative djent album. This album is so far my favorite effort of Periphery. I really appreciate the risks they are taking. They are stepping on the toes of what YOU (as a fan) think they should put out, and creating something they earnestly wanted.
 I felt that this point definitely came across in this album release.

I say all this in respect. I up vote you for promoting discussion.

"Periphery's Juggernaut Dual Release Debuts at #15 and 16 on the Billboard 200, Quite a Milestone.","Take all the djent away from P2 and its still way more prog than Juggernaut. In fact, probably more prog than it was originally, since djent has nothing to do with prog.

"Periphery's Juggernaut Dual Release Debuts at #15 and 16 on the Billboard 200, Quite a Milestone.","P2 was a much djentier album than Juggernaut. And I don't agree with you one bit with the whole ""take the djent out of P2 and it'll still be more progressive than Juggernaut"" claim. Periphery is moving away from the djent sound, but getting proggier and proggier. In fact, they are progressing in their musicality and song writing.

P2 actually felt like a prog metal album and was indeed a progression from P1, then Clear came along and gave us 30 minutes of fun pop metal, which I was fine with since it's just a side project. I've listened to Juggernaut enough now to make the verdict that I don't like this album. It's really boring, formulaic. Spencer's vocals are overdone and don't sound anywhere near as good as P2.

This feels like it would be fine on /r/peripheryband, but a prog metal album reaching #15 on the charts isn't really that impressive. It's a high charting for Periphery, and a high charting for Djent, but really not for prog metal. Opeth, Mastodon, Dream Theater, Tool have all had much higher charting albums."
"Periphery's Juggernaut Dual Release Debuts at #15 and 16 on the Billboard 200, Quite a Milestone.","first of all, every time a popular prog metal band puts out a new album people post about it here frequently for the first couple weeks.  Not sure why you're singling out Periphery when it happens all the time here.

Secondly, Prog Metal is still a niche genre, so regardless of what other prog bands have done, it is still notable when a prog band charts in the top 20, especially when it's a young band like Periphery that is really just hitting its stride.  This isn't a band that has had decades to build a cult following before starting to chart high.  They are doing it with their 3rd release(s).  And what's more impressive is that they are doing it while releasing not one, but two albums.

As for the other bands you listed, in the US Opeth has never charted above 19.  It took DT almost 20 years to put out a top 20 album.  Mastodon's highest is 6.  Is that ""much higher?""  As for Tool, yeah they're one of the biggest bands in the world.  Does that invalidate Periphery's success?  In any case I think you're really overstating how common it is for prog metal bands to chart in the top 20 (just talking in the US here)...it's only really the upper echelon of prog bands.  So if nothing else, this news is noteworthy because it firmly puts Periphery in that group."
"Periphery's Juggernaut Dual Release Debuts at #15 and 16 on the Billboard 200, Quite a Milestone.","While I'm not really a Periphery fan (I appreciate their jams seriously) I think it's a huge deal and deserves to be shared here."
"Periphery's Juggernaut Dual Release Debuts at #15 and 16 on the Billboard 200, Quite a Milestone.","I dunno man, I think it's a pretty big deal, especially considering both of the albums made it that high. I mean, obviously no one's going to buy only one half of a double album, but still... The bands you mentioned are huge and have been together for 15+ years, as well.

"CHON's debut LP 'Grow' out 3/24, features Matt Gartska, rerecorded songs","LP and EP don't mean much anymore.  If anything, most bands use them as showing the importance of the recordings.  Many bands use LP's to signal the record as important points in their careers.  EP's are used more often as intermediary releases, or as minor releases that aren't as grand or important artistically as an LP."

That source also says they got demands for the money from their publishing company immediately upon returning to the states.  That site hasn't been updated in a while though (no bassist is listed in the band lineup).

Perhaps they're out of the debt hole, but a label won't give them a chance since they have such a bad track record.  Sort of like quitting a tour in the middle of it to go home and write a record about pizza.  Hell, I'm not even sure they're still signed to a label at this point."

"HORSE the band - I Think We Are Both Suffering From The Same Crushing Metaphysical Crisis, one of the first bands I listened to in the realm of prog metal","They're still around.  As the other comments say, they had a terrible headlining tour off their Guitar Hero popularity + Inhuman Rampage.  They were just drunk the whole time and blamed it on the sound.

Anyways, they faded back to just the power metal scene, ZP Left after Ultra Beatdown, and their new singer came in with The Power Within.  They changed style considerably on that album, keeping the guitar wizardry to ONLY the solos, which are considerably shorter on this album.  It's more a heavy metal record than anything else.

Their latest, which came out a few months ago, is a great mixture of the style they were famous for and The Power Within, giving us the guitar insanity of the majority of their work plus shorter and (arguably) more focused songwriting.  Also, more riffs.

The cheese never left once."
"HORSE the band - I Think We Are Both Suffering From The Same Crushing Metaphysical Crisis, one of the first bands I listened to in the realm of prog metal","I saw them at a festival many years ago and they were complete jerks to the crowd.

"
"Skyfall [Adele] - Celestial Fury Metal Cover","Focus on the cadence of it. It needs to have a regular feel to it. You want to create a perfect sine wave. Vibrato is nothing more than bending a note up and down repeatedly, so focus on what note you're bending to. Is it a half step or a whole step? Sometimes overbending can sound good as well, as long as it's intentional and not the product of sloppy and careless playing. Some players like to use a more violinist-inspired vibrato by increasing pressure on the string, but I find that is a less dynamic way of producing vibrato. It's far easier to use your entire hand with your thumb on the neck functioning as a fulcrum to help you more easily bend the note. Hope that helps.. I'm not fantastic at explaining these sorts of things."

"Misery Signals - Two Solitudes. IMO Absent Light was one of the most criminally underrated albums of 2013.",""
"Misery Signals - Two Solitudes. IMO Absent Light was one of the most criminally underrated albums of 2013.","Ostensibly because few in the prog community considered Misery Signals prog up until this album. Seriously though, few bands could go on a five year hiatus, lose half their band members, and still release an album of this caliber."
"Misery Signals - Two Solitudes. IMO Absent Light was one of the most criminally underrated albums of 2013.","Absolutely. This album was chilling. "
"Misery Signals - Two Solitudes. IMO Absent Light was one of the most criminally underrated albums of 2013.","Fuck Yeah! These guys have definitely evolved into a more proggy sound."
"Misery Signals - Two Solitudes. IMO Absent Light was one of the most criminally underrated albums of 2013.","Every time 'best drumming in metal' discussions I drop Branden Morgan's name. He absolutely carries this album; the drums are so massive in the mix that it's like the rest of the band realized it as he was throwing down and sat there going 'fuuuuuck'."
"Misery Signals - Two Solitudes. IMO Absent Light was one of the most criminally underrated albums of 2013.","I find he overplays pretty often. Never been a huge fan of his"
"Misery Signals - Two Solitudes. IMO Absent Light was one of the most criminally underrated albums of 2013.","Man, I really disagree. I think he does a fantastic job of knowing when to play for the song, and when the song needs him to come out. And his more 'in your face' parts are phrased well, it's not just some variation of RLRLBB RLRLBB RLBB down the toms (aka the Mike Portnoy special) "
"Misery Signals - Two Solitudes. IMO Absent Light was one of the most criminally underrated albums of 2013.","I should clarify, I don't think of him as a bad drummer in any way and as a drummer I have to respect his ability, I just feel like there are too many parts where he could have played for the song and instead crammed as many notes in as possible. I found this was more prevalent on controller than absent light though. Just my opinion."
"Misery Signals - Two Solitudes. IMO Absent Light was one of the most criminally underrated albums of 2013.","In my opinion, the problem with this album was the production. It felt too thin to me, after Controller which has some of the best metal production i've ever heard. It was crushing. I can't help but feel like Absent Light was a step back, however the songwriting definitely still kicks ass."

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, any word on instrumental Kezia, Scurrilous, Volition, or any future albums? I love both instrumental and vocal versions!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We are currently getting the Volition one together.  Kezia and Scurrilous would take some serious digging for the masters - but definitely worth doing at some point.  Volition one should be available soon."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Will there be a vinyl pressing for that? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","if there is enough interest, definitely."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","let us know when there is!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Will you guys ever play Dunsel live? IMO it's your hidden gem of a song, only has like 10k views on youtube? Wtf. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","definitely one of my favs.  It's an important one to all of us - and I actually really remember us all enjoying when we played it live.  But you are right, I think the songs which are most important to us tend to get the least reaction at shows."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Luke plz"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Glad to hear, if you do decide to play it live make sure its in Birmingham, UK. I'll be there!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Went to 3 of your shows hoping to hear it - sadly didn't happen. But I'm sure to attend at least once every time you come to Germany :)

Also devoted quite a few evenings to practicing that song's guitar tracks... the string-skipping tapping/hammer-on/pull-off sections are the hardest I think - but I love this song almost like no other.
"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I remember they played it on their Scurrilous release tour (with Maylene and the Sons of Disaster oddly enough). I saw them at the Masquerade in Atlanta, but I'd like to think they played it at other shows on that tour. It never even occurred to me that it might be one of their more rarely played songs. Shame though, it's brilliant.  "

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Dunsel is literally my favorite song out of the 5 albums I have of you guys. Like plz play it moar"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","totally love Dunsel's lyrics, who wrote them (cuz i'm kind of lazy to do a google search :D)"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","agreed, Dunsel is awesome. Love that opening riff and the whole concept"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I saw them play Dunsel back in like 2012 in a small bar in Windsor, fucking incredible!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I'm jealous mate, one of my favorite songs of all time "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Yeah they played it when I saw them in Kitchener once, it was sweet!"

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","It always bothers me how Diz gets Johnny. Johnny was always way better than Diz. How do you feel about this? Was Johnny just using Diz because it was party-time and was always playing for the end game of getting back Carmen or did Diz live out her ultimate dream of getting Johnny that she was clearly working towards the entire movie? Or maybe both? I don't know the answer but I hope deep down Johnny was just using Diz. I never liked Diz. Team Carmen for life. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I think it was both.  Johnny was clearly a 10 when Diz was barely a 5.  And that shows by how un-devastated he is when she gets impaled.  He shoots the bug for more rounds than is even possible when he should be putting her out of her misery.  If that were Carmen, he would have beat bugsy to death with his own mitts.  
Johnny was using Diz, how could you ever respect her after sergeant dude beats the piss out of her infront of the whole platoon?
Anywho, I think you are on the right track.  Fuck diz, but Carmen was a piece of shit for a while there too...after all these years I have never known what to make of it all."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","tits though"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! Just wanted to say thanks for all the inspriation you've given me over the years with your fantastic compositions. I even got you guys [permanently affixed](http://imgur.com/a/Tnf8i) to me over the last year.

Anyhow, your style has clearly changed to become more and more progressive over the past few albums... are there any artists you have been listening to that may have influenced this direction?

Where is your favorite place to play on tour and why is it The Social in Orlando?

What are some of your favorite and least favorite tracks to play live and why?


Thanks for everything man!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I have seen that tattoo before - nice one!


I thought we went a little more straight forward on Volition as far as song writing went.  The songs feel more cohesive to me.  Although I am pretty close to it and very biased.  


We first discovered progressive music with Liquid Tension Experiment.  I think we have spent every moment since then trying to be that.


I do like the social in Orlando (if I am remembering the right venue).  but my favourite place to play will always be NFLD.  Magical place where it rains booze.


Favourite tracks to play live, one from each album:  Mist, Bury the Hatchet, Bloodmeat, Dunsel

Least favs:  I actually don't have a least fav, I am more scared of certain songs than others though!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","What songs are you scared of? And why are you scared of them?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","mainly the ones where I wrote guitar lines that may have been over my head.  Sure, I can bucker down in a comfortable studio chair and get them out as no one watches - but totally different story when I am nervous on stage and people might as well have microscopes on my fingers."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","One time I told you that I was going to analyze your performance and upload a review to the forums for all to scrutinize. It was sarcasm but I feel bad now. Sorry for the added stress. :/"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","It's really humbling to know that even your mighty (and incredibly handsome) self doesn't get it perfect every time."

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I wish you guys had played Dunsel at the Toronto show! It was still incredible though."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Bury the hatchet literally gives me the chills."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","That's probably my favorite part of Volition... how the music is still insane, yet seems more thought-out and methodical instead of piecing a bunch of parts together. 

Any chance of y'all ever having longer sets? I know it's taxing to play such difficult material for an hour but it'd be awesome to have you guys up there for a little more than an hour"

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Yeah. That show with Tesseract was one of the best shows I've ever seen. I was so stoked that they played both Dunsel and Bone Marrow"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Do you boys keep in touch with Moe and Riffy? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","yes - although I haven't heard from old riff in a while.  I know both of them keep busy, I can't go anywhere without seeing riffy post about a show he is playing with one band or another.

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","That answer makes me happy :) Was stoked for the Chris guest vox on Sex Tapes and The Rod on Underbite"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","What if I told you people felt that way about your band?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Any links to their music? Not seeing em on Spotify

Edit: youtube. i'm an idiot"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Make sure you only check out the albums from ""Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes"" and onwards. They were an average skate punk band (with awesome lyrics) in the 90s then once 2000 hit they became a glorious combination of thrash, prog and punk. Their newest album, Failed States is a perfect starting point. If you're into stuff similar to PTH (I'm assuming you are) check out the song ""Status Update"". Your brain will be on the floor. 
Also I could have sworn Propagandhi was on Spotify but if not, good old YouTube will work just fine.
"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I'll check em out, thanks!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! Where do you draw influences from when writing?   Are there any besides other bands/guitarists?  I guess on a broader scope, whats your writing process like? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","The tendency is to draw influence from current stuff - contemporary music that I wanna rip off basically.  However, we always try to find ideas in older stuff (classical, soundtrack, what have you).
Writing process is always evolving - last time was done mainly sitting in front of a computer.  Where as scurrilous was painfully hashed out by jamming.  I like both ways, but am hoping we find a better balance this time."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I had a feeling there was cinematic moments! I remember when scurrilous was being made/released you guys released a video with a track from inception.  Then i heard tandem and i noticed a chord progression from inception and  wondered if if there 'night bee some connection.' "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","strange coincidence, my pals John, cam and I are listening to the man of steel soundtrack right meow (also by Hans).  I had plans of ripping on the inception soundtrack in the future but didn't deliberately on Scurrilous.  Hi Milen!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey man!  If I hear anything resembling ""Flight"" (Man of Steel) from you guys I'll have to do my best to not be a giddy faced idiot"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","the contemporary rip-off thing really resonates with me. I get a TON of progression ideas from contemp music and soundtrack type things. This may also be due to the fact that ive been listening to PTH for the better part of 9 years or so."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I feel if you guys went the route that ADTR went you would soar. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","which route is that?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Don't! ADTR sucks and you guys rule &lt;3"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Well after leaving Victory they pretty much do everything on their own their own way. They are a bit more popular than you guys, though nowhere near the talent. I feel like that's what people think I am suggesting is become ADTR. Not at all. Independent recording, touring, merch, label-free the way to be. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Writing about high-school and leaving your home down over and over and over?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, I was wondering if there were any specific exercises you did to get your right hand so solid, I've been trying to learn how to play your stuff for years and just can't quite keep up on a lot of it.

Also, I love you guys so much. Thanks for being hilarious, cool dudes and making amazing music."

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","that's not a bad idea, thanks"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I'm curious about how successful the crowdfunding for Volition was. It certainly seemed like you guys embraced it and did it ""the right way"" -- being forthright with the expenses and costs, etc. So while it seemed to me to be a huge success, I'm wondering if you guys view it the same way.

Also, any plans for a new album soon? I'm really looking forward to hearing the direction you guys go next."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Definitely a success.  It pretty much changed our perspective on the industry and our own future.  We made tons of mistakes but have spent the last year trying to slowly right all the wrongs.  If we did it again, I feel like everything would run a lot smoother.  I will say it was one of the most exciting times of my life.
New album is on the way!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I'm glad you guys got yourself out of that financial rut. I had no idea about it until you released your crowdfunding campaign. I'm glad you found a way to make it work, lord knows that the industry can turn a lot of people into cynics"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Waiting to see how y'all top Volition."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke. Any chance we'll hear more songs in a similar style to ""Mist""? By that I mean fast, melodic, almost bordering on commercial with enough riffage to keep it grounded. Personally I grew up on melodic punk rock so that track hits all the right spots for me and you guys nailed it. Truly is my favourite PTH track."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Thanks eh!
We have the same punk roots and will never be able to escape them (not that we want to).  It feels right.  
I hope we right some bangers like that in the future too!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Gotta agree. Mist hit all the right chords with me. Genuinely beautiful song with riffing and melodies that reminded me of bands like Strung Out (which is a very good thing)."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Love Strung Out man."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I don't even like punk really and i loved Mist. Half for the music, half for the idea that the band wrote it from the heart, from a place of true love and appreciation for a place."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Are you gonna write another concept album like Kezia? I love love LOVE that story and how you organized the songs on the album.
P.S. Tour with BTBAM please and thanks"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","It's cool those lyrics still resonate with people.  It was definitely all Arif on that one.  Concept albums are such a treat - I hope we can do one again in the future.  Might need to bribe riffy though."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I'll give him my first born. I'll need about....10 months on that though"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Oh yes listen to this guy PTH + BTBAM = &lt;3"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","it worked for Coheed and Cambria and BT and the BAMs, also worked well with The Kindred. Would love to catch BTBAM with PTH or Periphery. Or Haken *drools*
"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","PTH, BTBAM and Haken... I would die. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","For sure. Coheed with BTBAM is hands down the craziest concert I've ever been to. Hell hath no fury like a mosh pit during a folk banjo break during Ants of the Sky . Followed by Favor House Atlantic later on. I did not survive, had to leave the pit lol"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","As a major Coheed fan who's been to many concerts, it weirds me out every time people up front are moshing so hard. The music is not even that heavy!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Moshing isn't for heavy music, its for fun! It's an expression of empathy. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Haha it threw me off more than anything. It was fun though"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I went to that tour as well, was pushed up against the barrier for the whole show. No escape"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I came just thinking about this tour... god damnit ! "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Back in 2009 right after Fortress came out i saw protest tour with BTBAM, in flames and killswitch. Such an amazing show"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","So, where has Arif been? Is he staying with the band? Also, How much longer do you guys see yourself writing albums and touring?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I think we softened the blow with that one with out announcements when he decided to walk away.  And now it's our fault that there is some confusion over the whole deal.  For the record, he is no longer a member of pth.  However, we hope he will make an appearance or two in the future in some way or another.  Dear god, I have clouded things again..."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I don't see clouds anywhere.
Dude has his own projects, but if he has time to contribute in some stuff for his old band, he's gonna do it.
I don't see why a band must have permanent members all the time, live goes on and people move back and forth."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I'm bummed to read that."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, it's Josh Hainge from the 1:25 minute mark in Skies.

Hopefully this comment doesn't come off as seeming too self-serving; I was just wondering how you and the rest of the band felt about giving up so much of your CD to guests.  I suppose it took more away from Rody than anyone else but I'm wondering how it affected the rest of the band, too, and whether or not you'd consider doing something similar to support a future crowd-funding endeavor.

P.S.  Last time you guys were in Edinburgh, Rody offered to let me up on stage the next time you're here playing Skies; you all plan on holding that up?  (*That* was self-serving...)"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Truth is, we didn't expect anyone to pull that kind of money together for the perk.  It was one of those things we laughed about and thought ""we will take this down in a day"".   But someone bought it on the first day (someone you might know ;).  
If you can look past the huge expense - it turned into a formidable experience for both us and you (we hope).  I couldn't have imagined a classier bunch of guys coming in and laying down their parts like they had been doing it for years.
I was also proud of Rody and his ability to teach you guys and pull great performances out of everyone.  I would do it again, but not for the insane price tag."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","My internet shit the bed last night, so I didn't get the chance to follow the ama for very long after I posted...

I actually tried to pay the first day but it took me a lot longer than I expected to convince my parents to let me do it (my card didn't have a high enough limit, so I needed the help even though I could afford it at the time), so I'm glad someone bought it and kept it posted.  If you guys lowered the price, wouldn't you be worried about too many people trying to get on board?  I know if I ever see it again, I'm gunning for it unless you stick a limit of one feature per person on it or something.

As for the experience, it was fricken unreal.  Hands down one of the best days of my life even though I was too nervous to properly socialize and had to bail early.  And it was made all the better when Volition actually came out and I got to hear that my money went towards making some of the best music I've ever heard."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey man, I totally forgot about that perk. Good Job on your part! "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","What's next for Protest the Hero? Will the next album be independent? Will it feature the new members? Will it be released this year?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We just started writing!  It's always a daunting feeling - a mountain to climb, but I think we are ready...
We are currently deciding how to go about releasing the new album.  I feel like the traditional label route is asking for failure - we tried that for 3 albums.  "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","To me it definitely feels more personal donating toward the album before its even made, from my standpoint I would love for you guys to go with crowdfunding again. That being said, if you can somehow use your crowdfunding experience as evidence to strongarm a label into giving you what you actually deserve then go for it. Also on crowdfunding I really liked all the opportunities to get unique swag (guitar picks/hoodies etc.)"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","No matter how I look at a label, I am not persuaded you need them for the whole package of being in a successful band.  We have learned a lot over the years and can do lots of it on our own.  I guess that in itself is a bargaining chip?
I am still in love with the idea behind crowdfunding.  Puts you and your fans in a position of power - and we mean it when we say we appreciate every single person who contributed."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Will Protest ever come back to Kansas? I know havent heard *come to ____city* My real question is oddly specific, in Blindfolds Aside @1:08 there is like a random flat note. Any idea what that was? Was it not caught or purposely in there? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","If you are referring to a vocal line - Juice and Rody (cheese), were very thorough.  Cheese refuses to use pitch correction and it probably had something to do with them liking that particular performance despite it being off by a cent or two.  Back then, bands didn't polish the living shit out of their records as much as now.  I know, I know, it's still a polished record.  But we did make a point of leaving in stuff we liked because it was either spur of the moment, or made us laugh while we were drunk."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I did more digging and listened to couple different versions, some definitely dont have it so somebody caught it. I listened to a couple and it wasnt there so I was beginning to believe I imagined it. But I found it in this one. It's at 1:43 before ""a sin"". I actually called Metal Injection and asked Rody about it he had no idea what i was talking about but then again I'm sure you guys dont listen to your own CDs as much as I do. Love you guys, thanks for answering. Please come to Lawrence again. Please. Please.

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","After I first heard PTH I downloaded Kezia from a 'less than reputable' website to check them out, and I always noticed my version having that sound in it too. I imagine it is a blemish from whoever ripped and uploaded the album to torrent websites  - sounds like an alert from a program like MSN or something. If you watch the music video, the audio in that doesn't have that blemish."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Well I'm glad someone else noticed it at least! "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hahah yes man i hear it every single time :)"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Maybe it's just that one upload? Have you hard it on a physical or direct download of the tune?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I think it is on one upload, but that upload was the one that circulated piracy websites and subsequently was downloaded a lot. There are a few versions uploaded on Youtube (including the official audio from the music video) that don't have it, so as far as I can tell on legit versions there's no beep. Basically it wasn't something that the mastering team behind Kezia left in as the OP was thinking, rather it was accidentally added by the person who ripped the album and uploaded it to the internet.

So probably half the people that have Kezia will have heard that beep, and the other half who bought the album legit will have no idea."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","[deleted]"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","You're that guy! I listened to the radio show. That is just a bad version of the song recorded off of someones computer and that noise is just an instant messaging service going off."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Seconded. Come to Lawrence, please. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Tell us about your current rig (including what pick ups your using :))
I love tacos."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","It's mainly *cringe* axe fx now a days.
For a musician who travels, every aspect of it makes sense.  I do miss that warmth and transparency of tube though.  I still have my beloved splawns and VHT amps that I will always adore though.  You never know when those could get subbed back in.


Picks ups are always changing.  I want to try BKPs but just haven't gotten around to it yet.  I generally come back to Duncans and Dimarzios though - my first set of duncans (duncan distortion) really woke me up to the difference of a quality pickup.  I spent every dollar I had back then paying for it haha.  Memories."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I just put in my first set of decent pickups a month ago.  I chose the Seymour Duncan SH-2 and SH-5, which I read is what you use in your ibanez s. I feel like a god now. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","but Luke... what about the tacos?!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke. What colour will my Kezia vinyl be?!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I am going to Samo (where we print our stuff) tomorrow and hashing it out all out.  Very open to your opinions."

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","PINK"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! 

I believe that you and the band have existed since you were teenagers. Your previous drummer leaving made me think that you guys probably might not have had the ""regular"" life most teenagers and young adults had when growing up, being in a band with relatively big success, touring, etc. Maybe I'm wrong about all of this. 

Anyway, how do you feel about yourself and where are you right now as a person? Has being in the band for so long ever felt like ""too much""? 

EDIT: Another question, which I apologize for if it's out of line. What do you guys do for a living other than the band? I'm guessing that even since you have so many fans ready to support what you do, it doesn't pay the bills completely. I'd like to know this for myself to have a better insight on what's it like being in a position as a musician like yours.

"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","You are right - we got started pretty young.  The success part varies - I guess success to us is the ability to live, be content, and pay our bills by playing music.  

I think we kept a level head most of the time on the road - and have benefited from a very enriching decade plus of travelling the world.  Although that may not be normal, I think we are all better off for it.

Having said that though - I feel like the readjustment to normal life after a tour (and inevitably when we hang this career up) is tough and will only get tougher.  There is a lot of growth and maturation we have sacrificed to be on the road.  It adds up over the years and shapes who you are.  Ask any of our friends, we are a weird bunch these days."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke. I've got a pretty serious question.

Would you consider a burger a sandwich?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","god no."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","That's fucking bullshit and you know it. A sandwich is stuff between two pieces of bread. The Wikipedia article for burger states it's a sandwich. I work making burgers and we call them sandwiches. Fuck you, I don't like PtH anymore and I'm deleting all your music off my phone. 

Today you hurt my feelings Luke. Only a Luke would do that. And you did it. Thanks :c"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I know Rody is pretty vocal with his hatred towards Djent, but how do you feel about it?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I have been found drunkenly moshing by myself to Meshuggah while in a bus on warped tour.  Hard.  More than once.  I love the idea, but hate the name."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We've all been there"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hi Luke, you make me very frustrated because PTH is one of my favorite bands and I can't play along with any Protest the Hero song on my guitar. Feels bad, but it's a constant reminder that I need to practice more, so thanks for that.

What are some of your favorite bands currently?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Always: Mars Volta, BTBAM, Coheed, Extreme, Propagandhi, Blotted Science, Sikth

Currently: Big Wreck, Periphery, A Wilhelm Scream, Plini, CHON, Hanson"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","THE MARS VOLTA!? OH my god im bout to hyper ventilate like a 13 yr old school girl!! I cant even begin to describe my love for both protest and mars volta, my favorite bands of all time hands down.

Brody and Cedric have that voice that just hits my ears in a way nothing else can!

Its really cool to hear that your a fan!!  
 "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","CHON! YES! I've fucking loved these guys since day 1!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Extreme is a surprising one! "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Will you be seeing Periphery in Toronto? (BTW we share a lot of commonalities in bands we enjoy, especially Hanson)"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","You probably won't read this since the ama is over but since you've heard plini what are your thoughts on Sithu Aye? Would you ever have any of them guest appear or appear on one of their albums yourself?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Sweet, the guitarist of my favorite band just listed my 2nd and 3rd favorite bands as some of his favorites too (Coheed and CHON respectively). Awesome to hear.


P.S. Still waiting on those Anthology Packs on Sheet Happens :P"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","A Wilhelm Scream, you have good taste in punk my friend."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","party crasher has easily become one of my favourite albums ever I think.  It does all the things my teenage and current self would agree with."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","hey man, did you guys even had pubes when you wrote search for the truth??"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I honestly don't know.  Penises are all the same size for sure though."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Thanks for doing this AMA, Luke!

You've been a huge inspiration for the last 6 years of my life and I've had an obsession with the pth albums you've released since then. Here are my questions! 

What is your writing process and how has it changed over the years? What is your approach to writing a riff or solo? Particularly on the new volition album. 

Any chance we will see you and Tim doing guitar play through similar to those of scale the summit or intervals? 

Lastly, Do you ever learn the songs of the bands you promote on sheet happens? Which has been the most challenging in your opinion?

Thanks! 

"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Writing process on volition was extensively done with Guitar Pro.  4 or so songs were written by sitting down and hashing them out (moe, tim, and myself).  I would prefer to better balance the mix of couch writing and rehearsal space jamming on this next album.


We are planning on doing our first real guitar play through in Feb.  We refuse to do the standard 'sit in a chair' idea though.  Expect something pretty stupid.


I generally learn sections of songs and rarely an entire one.  When I am learning anything on guitar, the motivation is generally to incorporate whatever it is into my own songs (pth songs).  


All of the bands on SH are gifted guitar (and bass) players.  I have learned tons just from editing the living piss out of those books!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Why do you feel that the traditional label route is failing?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","That too complicated a question for someone as stupid as myself to answer properly.
The short answer is probably the fact the an entire industry was too slow to change."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","hey luke, how often do you almost shit yourself? any close calls? elaborate. have a splendid day"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Finally - a question worth answering.


Like all of us, I have had my share of scares.  In our band, we have an unspoken motto.  And that is ""trust every fart""."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke,

Would love to know what it was like working with Chris Adler in the studio and how much of the drums he came up with and how much were already there.

Saw you guys at KOKO in London, fantastic as per..."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","It was a pleasure.  Real good guy, musician, and drinker of Heineken.  He came up with a whole bunch of the drum ideas himself.  We wanted him to have some freedom and approach it any way he wanted.  Having said that, Cam had a lot of the drums written up with programmed sounds.  They were a guideline for chris to hint at stress and direction we saw it heading.  Sometimes he played them verbatim and other times he might as well have given us the finger.  We were happy with both scenarios."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Will you guys be crowd-funding the new album? If not, what other options are you guys considering?

If you guys decide to crowd-fund, what would you do differently?

(Definitely down for participating in round 2 of crowd-funding! Saw you in Ottawa at the end of December, thank you so much for an incredible night.)"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Not sure yet.

I would change more things than I could type here.  I hope to write a full article / column about what I view as the learning lessons from the campaign so that other bands can take it and make what they want of it.


I personally would like to do one again, but everyone in the band has to agree on something before it's a lock!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Yo Luke! It seems like the last few years have been the most volatile for you guys (strictly from the outside perspective of members moving on for the first time.) Do you think this will have a great affect on your new material? Will you guys possibly branch out to places we wouldn't expect of PtH because of the new chemistry of the group as a whole? I'm excited regardless! 

Thanks for nearly a decade of my favorite music!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","It's hard to say.  Those guys will be missed for all sorts of reasons.  BUT!  There is a new sense of focus that popped up since they left...I guess it made us remaining members realize how much we loved it and how fragile it can be.  We just want to keep pushing ourselves, while we can..."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hello Luke!
As a bassist I wanna know that now when Arif is gone, will bass lines be as awesome as Arif's. (In his own way of course.)"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","If cam records the bass, you can expect lots of treats."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hi Luke! Thanks for doing the AMA!

I'm hoping to be the first person here to ask you to explain your apparent fear of 'night bees' I hope it isn't too scary for you to talk about."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","The fact that bees, which come out at night, is a scary idea that should be pretty self explanatory.  They are obviously supposed to be sleeping or something by that point, so it makes you wonder how crazy they are.


On the contrary, I have had my worst experiences with day bees.
Long story short: Tim and I were riding bikes on a trail in toronto.  We were going fast.  A day bee flew into my neck and must have gotten stuck between my helmet strap and adam's apple (yes I have a helmet, and yes, - the adam's apple thing was an exaggeration).


Anywho, he/she was obviously pretty upset that they were stuck and kept stinging me in the neck.  After that, four things happened:

1. I grabbed the day bee in my hand to get it off.
2. It stung my hand a bunch
3. I fell off my bike 
4. The skies opened up and unleashed an unreal thunderstorm.



"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Then the idea for 'Skies'? (Sorry, it kind of fits though?)"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","The absolute sincerity in this is so good."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Thanks for answering! I will never trust a day or night bee again! And good on you for having a helmet, gotta protect that noggin!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Wow, fucking step four there, lol."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I found out about you guys from Tap Tap revenge years ago, Bloodmeat. loved the track and instantly loved the band, I wondered if this was a common thing? And what your thoughts on this are? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","That's kind of neat that you found out about us that way - seems like the popularity of that game was kind of short lived?  I know for sure that I was really bad at it.
It's cool when people find out about us like that, because who knows if you ever would have without it.  Little things like that can go a long way, we miss being in video games.  That was the best because you get a copy of the game for free (usually)."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! If you'd tell anyone that you play in a band, and he or she would not know Protest the Hero, what would you let them listen?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I definitely wouldn't push our music on anyone.  But if they insisted, I would probably show them Mist.  "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! What was the inspiration behind the video for Hair-trigger? It's just so amazing. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","kind of a funny story...


The video treatment was originally written for Tongue-splitter.  The song was named after the ability to think one thing and say the other (doublespeak if you will).  The idea for the video was to be playing crazy music while doing something else.


We quickly found out that we submitted the wrong song for a specific grant  (our gov't has a grant system for canadian artists of all genres).  We tried to switch the song but risked losing the grant.  We decided to move forward anyway, and I think it turned out better!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","So whats the story with the bees and you almost loosing your thumb?!?!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I already explained the bees.  Or tried to.


The thumb:
My brother and I used to brawl as soon as my parents would leave the house.  Exit parents, enter plunger in my hand.
I was motioning to touch my brother Spencer's face with the plunger.  He obviously didn't like that and grabbed a giant, metal BBQ spatula to defend himself.  I entended my arm toward his face and he blocked it by bringing down the spatula (with the intention of perhaps knocking it out of my hand).  He connected with my thumb which was securing the spatula.  It split my thumbnail in half and pretty much cut off the tip of my thumb.  It was hanging on by a thread.


Fearing a grounding, we wrapped it up and pretended nothing had happened.  I couldn't feel anything since it had cut through the nerve.  The rest is history but because we didn't act fast, I was apparently lucky to ""get it back"".   I will say that stitches in your nail bed is pretty intense."

Was this smile sincere? i hope so....When will you guys be returning to the Midwest?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I am angry most of the time.  If I smiled, it had to be sincere right?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! As a hungarian i couldn't help but realize all the hungarian stuff going on in Palms Read's video. What building was it shot in or what does it have to do with Hungary?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","They actually discuss that in this interview (it's in Hungarian). Not to steal Luke's thunder or anything like that though haha.

Edit: Forgot the link lol. http://nuskull.hu/interjuk/azt-hiszem-en-jo-villanyszerelo-lennek-interju-a-protest-the-heroval/"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","thanks for the clarification /u/gosca 

It was a Hungarian Hall in Toronto - I would have to look up what it's called.  And I am just not prepared to do that."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Luke, if you could describe the next album with a vegetable, what vegetable would it be?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","This question"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I got asked a similar question when I got interviewed for a job as a bus boy at Boston Pizza when I was 16.  I can't remember what I answered, but the important thing that I took away from it, was that it was a stupid question."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","A stupid question deserves a stupid answer."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Luke what's more metal.

A.  a skeleton bird devouring a human man who happens to be shredding Blood Meat as he dies. 

B.  A goat with a top hat, serving his victims red licorice chapstick before he sends them to their firey graves.

C.  Protest the Hero playing in Newfoundland.

"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","B.  It's the only one which doesn't have anything to do with us."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","What's your method for writing riffs/songs? Do you just write as you go, or do you consider the structure of the whole song when you start writing it? How do you make sure that the songs ""flow"" says right?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","If I am writing on my own, I will usually come up with a handful of riffs / ideas that will work with each other (same key, same tempo, same motif, you get it).  If it doesn't flow - it will usually get the boot.
The structure gets juggled around until something feels like a song I guess.  it's an ongoing guess and test, and I think my best spots are when I am able to stop letting the big picture of each song scare me.  Just move forward and stop over thinking your work.  You always have the benefit of taking time away from it and coming back and realizing what sucks and what doesn't."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","How much music theory goes into your songwriting, if any?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","we used to pretend we knew a lot about that kind of thing.  Now a days we go for what 'feels' right.  The odd time though, we will make a point of pursuing something based on theory."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Speaking of odd time, how the hell do you guys come up with some of your timings? Kezia and Fortress seem to be especially hectic. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, first off I want to say you're a very handsome man.

How do you dial in your live tone? Whenever I see you I'm impressed how smooth your lead tone sounds but how beefy your rhythm tone sounds. I assume you don't have time to change pickups between those riffs."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","&gt; Hey Luke, first off I want to say you're a very handsome man.

I know.

Tone wise, I think it's largely what our guy at front of house is doing.  He can take a relatively thin tone and make it sound beefy.  I am never satisfied with my stage sound - and now I have lost too much of my hearing to even trust myself..."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","&gt; &gt; Hey Luke, first off I want to say you're a very handsome man.

&gt; I know.

Smooth as hell.
"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","How much of a success was Volition to you guys?  Are you happy with how it did monetarily?  Critically?  Artistically (in your opinions)?

Favorite song off of it?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We are pretty proud of the album and corresponding record cycle.  My only regret is not doing a single support tour - headlining can get old, and doesn't necessarily put you in front of a lot of 'new' faces.  


Monetarily, I can afford to pay my bills and take my lady out for dinner every now and then.  That's something I would have never believed when we first started.


Critically is something that is totally out of our control, so as good as it feels to read a positive review, it feels pretty good to read a negative one too.  It just makes you better.


Fav song: Skies"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, thanks for being a musical inspiration to a legion of musicians around the globe! 

I had a question about song writing, how do you try to stay fresh? push yourself forward? and generally not get stuck repeating yourself? Protest the Hero is one of the few bands that continue to sound fresh and exciting album after album; it is quite impressive! "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","It's hard to stay fresh, especially after 4 full length albums.  At the same time though, it feels good to keep doing what you are good at.  In that respect, I love repetition.  


I am happy you find us ['fresh'.](http://i.imgur.com/DoJKR1t.gif)  "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","what's your favorite riff(s) to play? can be PTH or other."

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","What are your favorite places to go when you're on tour in Europe?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! What song do you feel has been the hardest for the band to write or come together with? Not only based on technical aspects, but also on obstacles the likes of writer's block or something similar."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","There is always one song from every album writing session that is doomed from the beginning.  We are never happy with it, keep changing it, or keep trying to force some clunker riff/section in because we are clearly out of ideas.  That song usually gets scrapped.  But other times, we call it A Life Embossed."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","DUDE so good! I know ya'll are touring all the time, any crazy stories from the road?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","K this is Cam typing this one cause Luke is too lazy and this one's a doozy.

So we were in Belgium in June playing a festival, and our stage manager Henry/Hank hadn't been drinking for a month or two. There were a lot of his favorite bands playing that day, so I sat him down and said ""Dude, much respect for going off the booze for a bit, but what's the point if you can't enjoy yourself? You're at a festival with a bunch of your favorite bands playing, fuckin have a beer or two."" 

Henry eventually agreed with me, and succumbed to the booze that he deserves. We were each given about a 24 of drink tickets each for the day, so he was well prepared for the onslaught.

Skip to the end of the night, it was 2am and bus call for us. We all stumble on, Henry passes out in his bunk around 2:30am, we all pass out eventually around 4/4:30.


Next morning, our tour manager is directing the driver through Munich, and decides to check his email (this is around noon the next day.) Then he says ""Um, guys, I got an email from Henry at 6am. There's no body to the message, and the subject simply says ""Lost"".""

We checked the entire bus, all the bunks, the driver's bunk. We had officially lost a crew member somewhere in Europe.

Long story short, he somehow woke up in Holland still wasted with puke in his boxers, his phone was gone, he was berated by German cops, took 6 trains (he missed his stop twice cause he kept passing out) and eventually made it back to us the next day at 11pm.

There's more to this story but it's an awful lot to type out with the amount of beer in my system."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Henry = Henry Selva?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Yes. The dude from THA"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Sorry man, Rody tells this one better."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","This is Cam.

You shut your entire hole."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","The whole hole?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Fucking amazing. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","How is Moe these days? Is he happy being(or possibly done) with school? 

Also, have you heard The Double Cuts? Brilliant group, I think!

Also thanks for having me and my brothers on your bus in Austin last year for my birthday. That was the highlight of my year hanging with yall and TSF!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Moe is good as far as I know.  We keep trying to get together because I rent a desk at an office right beside where he works.  It's pretty shameful we haven't succeeded yet.  I will ask him when I see him though.


Yes, I have heard the double cuts and agree.


No problem - you guys were fun to chill with.  I wish I could have kept up with your rate of consumption."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, massive fan here, saw you guys on the 27th of December and in August at the Moustache Club and the shows were amazing!  The music you guys make has pulled me from some really bad places and it always makes my day better!

My question is what if your favourite venue to play at?  Also do you notice a difference between hometown crowds and others?

Thanks again for the awesome music!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Venue: Danforth music hall was a pretty special one to crank off the list.  It has been there since 1919...in Canada, that's old.


Definitely notice a difference between hometown crowds and elsewhere.  We will never take our fellow Torontonians for granted.  This is the place we started and will be the place it ends."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Have you guys ever considered having Jadea Kelly join the band full time? I absolutely love every time she's contributed to your records!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Jadea has her own amazing and unique career.  Despite her fitting in with us losers perfectly, we could never ask that.  We think it's just cool our paths cross continuously."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, saw you in Edinburgh, Scotland recently. You hurt your hand during drumhead trial so hope you were ok, song kinda suffered though haha.

Anyway, I would love you guys to do some covers or even a full album of them, it's been done before I know, so would that be a thing you would consider?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Sounds like me ""hurting my hand"" was some sort of non-verbal way of making an excuse.  That song is ridiculous and I know it has suffered from time to time.  


We would love to do a set where we cover one of our favourite albums (collectively) but just haven't gotten around to it yet."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","What are some things you like to listen to that don't sound like Protest at all? If anything ever happened to the band, would you continuing writing and would it be something drastically different from what you do now? 

Thank man!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I listen to a lot of soundtrack stuff, movie scores etc. The progressions involved are always ear candy for inspiration.

I hope I would continue writing if the band broke up, but it would sound exactly the same."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke I am big fan of Protest the Hero and your guitar playing! I was wondering what is your approach to mastering some of the tricky riffs on volition? like the one in drumhead trial where you and Tim are both playing two different riffs with lots of half and sixteen note rests."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","The call and answer stuff is often my favorite. I do think however that we went too far with that section in Drumhead. The back half is almost impossible to play in time if you're honoring the album version entirely. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","How was your experience filming the divine suicide of K video?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","To be honest it was a nightmare.

That video was written, produced, and edited without our true input.  We felt strange on set, and even worse once we saw the final product. It's hard to believe now that no one stood up and said ""this isn't what we want..."" but no one did.  It was a milestone in our young days as proof of that saying ""If you want it done right, do it yourself"".

There is a reason you will never see us promote that monstrosity."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Have you guys considered using 7 string guitars at any point?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey luke, did you guys ever play Skies live ?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","not yet.  we will though - something about using a capo live scares me.  I am a pussy though.  one day."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Really ? I thought I saw you using one during Sequoia Throne in Calgary "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hairband to mute the strings"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","This guy watched the Sequoia Throne lesson"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","How important is it for you to have great FOH/TM/Tech's working with you on the road?

Examples. Capps and Hank."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Very important.  Both those guys are the best - it's going to be hard going on the road in the future without them (I think they may both be retiring).
They are my brothers."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, hope you're doing well. When you're writing, how do you match tones to the riffs written, do you always start with a base tone and expand from there or do you start fresh?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","This last album, we left that up to the dudes recording it, Cam, Juice, and Aaron from Intervals (who helped us with tone stuff).
Sure, we chimed in when we liked a tone, but left it up to them to make most of the big decisions."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey... so.. what are the colours of the limited edition record presses you're doing? Also, how has it been not being signed to a label? Everything I've seen has been ambiguous about the difficulty of setting everything up yourselves instead of relying on others. Do you prefer it this way or would you ever consider going back?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Those are going to be decided tomorrow - I am excited and have a lot of ideas, but it might be cool to poll people through our facebook or something to give suggestions.  People think their suggestions don't have an impact on the decision, but they really do.  


It has been amazing without a full blown label behind us - we still have distribution deals in place and definitely appreciate the guidance we get from said labels.  The difference is we are pretty free to follow or not follow that guidance.


It's a roll of the dice about which route is better, but we love gambling."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Did you know that your drummer can't even play Hot For Teacher?

Love you Mike...
Top of the World"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Can I have a free pair of shoes if I hype you guys on here?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Do you play acoustic at all? What's your favorite acoustic that you own?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Not really.  I had a Parker acoustic but had to sell it.  Arif would have been relieved.  He thought it was the ugliest thing he had ever seen."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke. Love you guys and seen you all numerous times. What is the most complex guitar riff that you play live?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We don't play it live much any more but the beginning octave displacement riff in Spoils is a frightmare."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Yes it fucking is."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","It makes me happy to hear that because I know exactly the part you're talking about and i have difficulty playing it fast too  :o)"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! Thanks for taking the time for this AMA! First off, you guys really played a kick-ass show here in Moncton, NB last year, hope to see you guys back here again sometime! 

Second, do you see yourselves as a band revisiting the storytelling-type lyrics of Kezia or Fortress at any point in the future? (ex. Bone Marrow, Kezia) "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Thanks!
I hope we do revisit that kind of thing - but I don't know if we could do it better.  Arif put together and awesome set of lyrics.

On the other hand, I can relate much more to Rody's lyrics which can often make the song more special to me as a whole."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","&gt;I can relate much more to Rody's lyrics which can often make the song more special to me as a whole.  

Totally understandable! Thanks for replying. Really looking forward to the new material."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Would you guys ever consider doing a Propagandhi cover of sorts? Would love to hear a Protest-esque take on one of their songs, especially since I guess your music has been quite influenced by them.

Anyways, loved Volition, easily my favorite album yet."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We would all love to do it - but I have a feeling the P fellers would hate us for it.  Those songs are as good as they are going to get, we would butcher it I think."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hi Luke:) What's your favorite book?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","No brainer:
http://i.imgur.com/lg5pxKA.jpg"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Could you explain the album art for volition? Why the vulture? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We sent Jeff Jordan the lyrics and a couple demos from the album asking him to interpret it. He liked some of the themes of interpretation in the media and elsewhere. He came up with the ""Media Vulture"" and we loved it. 

It felt good to leave it in Jeff's hands.

Google ""Lida and the Swan"" and check out the wiki. I think it was Jeff's main motivation. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","If you haven't seen it, [this](http://www.stereokiller.com/newsreviews/newsimage/original/Untitled2.jpg) is the full album art. I assume the other one is mostly so they can have a cover without some chicks tits hanging out"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! My question is what album was the most fun to record? PS. I will gladly donate if you decide to crowdfund your next album :) "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hands down it was Scurrilous.  We lived on an aboriginal reserve (the studio has two apartments they offered to people recording).  Although it was still a couple hours drive from home, it was the most remote place we have recorded.  I still look back on those days and get goosebumps sometimes.  Positive energy and an unbridled enthusiasm for the future.  Wont forget that one."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey, Luke, saw you and the band for the first time last November in Czech Republic, traveled ~3k km (both directions though) just to see you guys and I'm totally satisfied with everything. I'm still processing that I saw you live, since you're my favourite band at the moment, even though i wear my snapback every single day since then :D No question, just greetings from the small country of Bulgaria, hope to see you and the guys ASAP! Cheers!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! What was the inspiration behind the song ""skies?""...one of my favorites off of volition.  keep up the awesome work!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","If you're asking about the lyrics, you'll have to wait for Choady's AMA.

If you're asking about the music, we started off by trying to do something different (hence the capo and clean guitar intro/outro).

We felt it was an awesome way to end the album because there was something suggestive about that song which hints at where we're going in the future. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! I'm a huge fan, you guys rock my dick off. 

Just one question: how do you guitar like you guitar? 

Thank you, 

Dickless Fan"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, a couple of Q's for you!  
What are your primary warm ups on your guitar?
And also do you know when the Anthology pack on sheethappens will be available next?  Im very interested in purchasing that but its out of stock :("
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hello, first of all I'd like to say that going to see protest the hero last December in Houston was probably one of the best shows I'd been to.
As for questions

1)How long does it take for you to come up with the increasingly technical sections/leads in songs? An example being the ""Plant the Seed"" guitar lead in Drumhead Trial or something along those lines.

2)Any plans for a signature guitar or pick ups in the future?

3)Also, As someone who owns the volition tab book, would there ever be a possibility of official GP files?

Thanks!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","3) We are going to start to offer GP files this year.  We will be doing that in the face of theft though.  A GP file is like 9kb and shared instantly.  We aren't convinced people will actually pay for it when they know they can get it for nothing.  We are still going to do it though - because we both agree there is nothing like learning from a GP file."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","What about Brazil? Last time you guys came here I didn't have the resources to see the show. Yeah, sad thing.

Was the experience good, to the point of coming back here? I'm really looking forward to it :)

One more question: I've never seen any video of PTH covering any song. Am I missing something there? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","You guys should sell a digital tab book with the album. Albums come with lyrics, why not music notes?  Sidenote:  The new album is the shreadyist yet. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We have thought about that - it's a great idea.  Maybe we can offer that as a pack for the new album.  If you don't want the music score with it, you should have the choice not to ever see that mess of notes right?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Nope, should be mandatory.  You have to acapella your favorite lick to buy the albums as well.  "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, love what you do in Protest. Just a simple question from me, what is your favorite song to play live?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Most of them are a nightmare to play live haha. I personally like when we randomly bust out a cover (which is usually Linoleum).   but if I had to pick one of our songs, I would say Mist."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Im pretty sure I'm not the only one who wants to be a newfoundlander too now. I wonder if they will thank you for the influx of visitors in the coming years :D"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","And the funnest to be a part of, Mist. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","[deleted]"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, thanks for creating some of my favorite music. Any plans to tour in the Philadelphia area soon? My brother and I have not missed a show you guys have had here in ages!!!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","thanks fella!  Phili will always be on the map while doing a major market US tour.  I love ending a tour in that city - always an amazing show to go out on.  And it doesn't get much better than the Troc to me!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, you and Tim have been a huge influence and inspiration on my guitar playing. The riffs and chord progressions/shapes you guys use are incredibly unique. How do you normally go about writing a song? Where do your ideas come from?

Thanks!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I usually start with a verse.  I like em to be fast and riffy but without interfearing with the vocals.  It's my comfort zone, so starting with that is usually my gateway into a song.  We used to try and write chronologically - make sure we start with the intro, move to the verse, etc.  I don't think that's a very open minded way of approaching music for me now a days.  I like to write out a bunch of parts and then let them come together in my mind over a period of time.  I start to hum it one way in the shower and at some point, I can't 'unhum' it.  That's when I know it has to go that way."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! First of all thank you for your nice Riffing, Licking, Sweeping etc. - you are one of my favorite guitar player. 
To my questions: 
What are techniques you are currently working on or try to get better? 
What is your songwriting routine? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I have gone over quite a bit of songwriting stuff so just going to grab the first part of your question.


I am currently working on getting better at chicken picking / hybrid picking.  It's insane to hear what people can do with the technique and I have always wanted to utilize it more.  Hopefully you will hear how I have progressed in the new tunes."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Thanks for the answer! I'm looking forward to it."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Been a fan for years ever since my guitar teacher first introduced me to The Dissentience. Took part in the crowdfunding on the last album and hope to again someday if you choose to do it again. 

Now, question time. If you guys could cover any song, what would it be and why?  "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Extreme - Anything from III sides to every story."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I can definitely see you guys doing an amazing version of Warheads.  Thanks for the reply!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","[deleted]"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Truke, long time fan.

I was wondering if you have any tattoos, or tattoo stories?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","No tattoos.  I watched Arif's eyes roll back in his head the first time he got a tattoo.  It really made an impact on me. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Are you guys touring Canada? Come to sudbury again! "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Our last Sudbury show was a bit of a stinker.  Can you tell your friends!?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Not a question, just wanted to say that Volition is one of my all time favorite albums."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Shoutout to a fellow metal head and disc golfer!!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Haha hell yeah!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We appreciate that - here's hoping we can top it on the next one for you."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hello! I just wanted to say I'm a Volition backer (my name is somewhere in the vinyl :D) and I loved every step you guys took during that funding campaign. I'd do it again in a heartbeat."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Thanks a lot.  We appreciate every single person who contributed.  I hope we can do it again in the future."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Saw you guys live in Little Rock last year and just wanted to say you guys threw one hell of a concert and thanks for signing my copy of Volition on vinyl and cd! "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","thanks and no problem.  Charming city."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Luke,
PTH has been my favorite band for nearly 8 years now. Thank you for all the amazing music.

That being said, would you rather always feel like you have to poop? Or always have a slight headache? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I have one of these conditions.  It's confusing."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, I am a huge fan of your music! My question is what tips do you have for increasing picking speed? When I do some of the runs from your songs, like the end of Bloodmeat, I tend to sacrifice cleanliness for the speed. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I had the same issue (and still do).  Because my picking hand was sluggish at times, I decided to focus on getting my legato flying!  I use that to fill in the notes I can't cleanly pick.  Look up some of the masters of picking though - Paul Gilbert being a monster.  He gives tons of advice on speeding up your right hand and breaks down exactly what you need to hear.  I wouldn't be anything without his advice and ability to TEACH me properly."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, you and Tim are perfect. Actually perfect, as in without any sense of flaw. You are a huge influnce on me as a guitarist.
Is there any particular excersise, song, or scale that you find really fun to practice, something expansive? Thanks based Luke."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Guilty, as charged.
But seriously, Tim and I have been trying to play Technical Difficulties up to speed for our entire lives.  Still...no dice."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, the next time you guys play a show in Indiana, I'll buy your beer for the night. What do you guys like to drink?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","That would be lovely, but only if you buy one for Bobbo from the contortionist too - provided he is not on tour and cares to come out to the show."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Any potential for another concept album in the future?  Also, I think it would be pretty sweet if you guys could make a full tour with Unearth and Intervals."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We have toured with both of those bands, but separately.  I agree that a tour with all three of us would be magical.  


There is always potential for conceptual stuff, it just depends how far we want to take it.  Musically, we are always thinking of sneaking in conceptual ideas."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","How much did Chris Adler contribute creatively? Did he just show up and play the parts or did he write the record with you guys?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","He contributed big time.  We hashed out ideas with him and gave him free reign to do what he wanted.  He is a big reason the album turned out so great.  Tim and I had a great time jamming and laughing with him for two weeks before we hit the studio.  I remember he would be in there before us and leave hours after we did....on a shitty old bike tim leant him.  It was March in Toronto, so not ideal bike weather hahah"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","What would be your main advice to a band just starting to jam together, just starting to hit the road to tour and a band just releasing their own first album?

I realise this requires three answers but even if you only answer one that'd be awesome. Big fan, keep up the dope shredding!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I would try to tell them the importance of learning as you go.  As a young one, a big portion of our band (myself included) just drifted through the motions.  Let others figure stuff out for us (manager, label, circus clown, etc).  If we had have taken the time to understand each step, I wouldn't have had to go back and learn it all ten years later.  By all means, let people HELP you!  But don't let anyone but yourself sit in the driver's seat."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Thanks man, that is actually a problem we're facing atm when trying to decide how to focus our time and who we can trust little tasks to. It's not on the same scale but I guess we've all had those moments where we wished the guy organising the gig and selling tickets was someone a little less incompetent!

Cheeky follow up question: As fans nowadays will always torrent an album before seeing a band live, in your opinion is being able to control your own sound/output the way you want more or less important than being in control of your stage/live show?
I guess I'm asking who's better to leave to do their own thing, if need be, a producer or a tour manager?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Neither.  Make sure you love and trust both of those magnificent bastards."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","aha, I'll keep this in mind man, thanks for going above and beyond for your fans again, it's a big inspiration for people like me and the other musicians here."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey luke, what is your favourite flavour of doritos?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I haven't tried those ones where you play roulette with 1 out of 6 spicy doritos (or something like that).
I think that was an underrated and hilarious idea from a marketing stand point.  I hope those chips were hot as fuck."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","edit: cam just informed me you can do this at some pizza places.  We are going to do that right now."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Why not just have Yimmy do it?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Do you remember tea bag kid from your Glasgow show a couple of years back? It was the end of blood meat and Rody rode his face and if so, do you have anything to say to him? I'll let him know when I see him in about an hour :P"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I don't remember this specifically, but it reminded me of something else.  We used to travel around with pepper spray - don't know how we acquired it.  I remember we somehow convinced a guy at a show to spray some in his butt.  He did, and it was amazing - praise that guy."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hello Luke!

I've been a fan of PTH since the Kezia days, but what made me fall in love with the band was Fortress which is still my favorite &lt;3

When Scurrilous came out, it wasn't a concept album anymore (boo D:) and it sounded more vocal-centered. This was amped up even more on Volition, where Rody fucking nails it in every song. How was this shift of musicality within the band? What is the creation process of PTH?

Extra question, from my heart: Will Arif write lyrics again? &lt;3

Thanks for doing this!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Kezia was our only true concept album.  Fortress had some vague concepts, but I would never call it a concept album.  It is amazing to see how many people on here love the conceptual stuff - I do too, but it seemed like everyone started doing it, or pretending that their release was some deep, conceptual work.  We tend to step away from stuff if we think it's getting trendy.  It wasn't something we all sat down and discussed, the change happened naturally.  Maybe we will go back that route when everyone and their step brother stop trying to do it?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, what's the makeup of your rig these days?? Walk us through the signal path!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","She is pretty simple now.  Tim and I have an 8 space rack.  Contents of said rack are 2 axe fx unite, a poweramp (which we constantly change), power converter, and tim has a wireless unit.  We run those to front of house (di signal) and also run them through cabinets on stage.  That's pretty much it!  We don't endorse any of our amp products on stage.  The only product I fully endorse are Ibanez geets. "

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Considering how technically demanding your music is, have you ever gotten injured playing guitar? If not, what do you do to prevent injury and keep your hands/forearms healthy?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","/r/nsfw "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","In heindsight, I feel like this deserves a less joke answer.  I have never had a blatant injury in which I had to stop playing or something like that.  I have had muscle and joint pain while playing guitar which definitely affects my playing.  This is generally if I don't stretch or warm up enough.  And sometimes if I have warmed up TOO much.  That's the worst because I am sore before we even start!


We used to use these little warmup devices from d'addario.  The will apparently do wonders for your forearms but we pretty much used them because they were hilarious.  I would encourage you to try one out though.  Once you get the hang of it (takes some time - tim still can't do it on his own) you feel some muscles in there you didn't even know where in there.

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Will you go back to doing another concept album, I really enjoyed the subjects that were visited and the the way the songs were brought together?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey There, I answered this question a bunch so am not going to reiterate again.  Just wanted to make sure you didn't think I was ignoring your post."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Other than your own, are there any albums that I absolutely must get right now if I haven't done so already? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Extreme - III sides to every story"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke,

A lot of your stuff seems based in 4/4 with a lot of variation within the actual songs (what i mean is, usually your songs are established as 4/4 and then will sneak some off-time measures in there). Do you find it difficult to count sometimes while on stage, especially since, in a live setting, there is typically a bit more room for improv/not playing the ""written"" part?

Thanks for doing this!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","4/4 is always going to be the comfort zone for me.  Really stuff that's close to it as well, 7/8 being my favourite, but now a days used quite often.  Us guys in the band will generally count stuff differently - it's rare that I feel myself counting in my head, although I try to keep my foot tapping as often as I possibly can.  Focussing on just that simple aspect made me a better player.  


I have gotten lost on stage before and had to stop (pretty embarrassing), but that is usually do to the fact that my mind tends to wander when we are playing - especially if I am having a good time.  I start to think about battling my cat when I get home (we are at constant odds), or something equally unrelated to anything musical.  That's the long way of saying that I don't generally get into trouble with counting, nor do I feel the need to do it unless I am learning a new piece (5/4 gives me some trouble sometimes, don't know why hahah).   "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Awesome, thanks so much for the comprehensive response!
"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Your album Kezia really hit a note with me when I first heard it and the more I listened to it and understood how it came to be written and the premise of the album I was really hooked on you guys. It's your only journey so far into a concept album with a key theme to it and I was wondering if you have any more ideas like this lined up, or is it like you mention in Dunsel:

&gt; ""The songs we sung when we were just young
&gt; have all but lost their meaning""

Also Volition seemed to be a lot more about vocal hooks and lyrics than previous albums (although there are some absolute fantastic tunes on that album - Skies, Animal Bones), was this a conscious decision you made when writing or is this just the way you seem to be progressing as a band?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Kezia was a great ride at the time - we really wanted to put something forward that got people talking.  We had no idea the reach it would have while writing it, nor did we dream that we would still be talking about it almost ten years later.  We are very glad you enjoyed it but at the moment have no concrete plans to dive into a concept that far again.  You have to remember the lyrics were written by a fellow who is no longer writing in the band.  If we did something else conceptual, it would certainly take on an entirely new feel and direction.  I am glad we did it, but don't think we would revisit those specific themes again.  Who knows though right?


The lyrical reference is something that you will have to ask Rody in his AMA.  He wrote that set and although that line certainly means something to me - it's an interpretation (just like you) and not necessarily what he was thinking.  It's the beautiful thing about lyrics no?


I think we have settled down some in the chaos dept over the years and have found our role as a vocal-centric band.  Sure, we love to rip some riffs, but what sets us apart from other bands are the vocals.  Lots of guys emulate rody now a days, but I think he still does rody best.  We will continue to put an emphasis on the vocal lines and make sure melody and song craft is job #1"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Thanks for the great input and replying 2 days after the designated AMA! 

I do disagree with the vocals being what sets you apart. Your sound is a bit less niche than it was a few albums back but I think that's just how you've progressed and the result of losing two founding members. 

I think you could be an amazing band even without Rody. I'm probably thinking too far back from where your current mindset is but I think Fortress has been your most finely crafted 'PTH' sound all-round. Don't get me wrong, you know Rody when you hear him - what's really magical is knowing a Hoskin/Millar riff when you hear one as I feel it's much harder to create your own sound on a guitar than vocally.

Regardless, I still love the music you're producing and ever since I first heard Blindfolds Aside when I was 13 I've been a huge fan. You're one of my inspirations on the guitar and I strive really hard to emulate your sound and be able to play your songs. Keep getting better so I can keep chasing."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, thanks for the AMA! You guys are easily one of my favorite bands and I love all of your music videos. Do you guys create the concepts for them or do the directors come to you with them?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We have done it both ways.  Sometimes, a director will approach us with an idea they have already thought through.  The ""Heretics"" video concept was something Marc Ricciardelli had always wanted to do.  We are generally up for anything (especially when we were younger) and loved the idea.  Even though it had next to nothing to do with the song itself, he created a video that people still talk about today!


Sometimes we will pitch an idea to a director.  For the Limb from Limb video, I was on a kick of watching village people vids - say what you want, they are hilarious.  I thought we could do a good job of recreating it.  We were just lucky Marc Andre took the idea on with so much enthusiasm and professionalism.


Other times, we have been on tour and not had much say in a video *cough, divine suicide cough*.  Those are ones we are pretty ashamed of.


The way it tends to work now a days is marc ricc and I sit down over a couple beers and maybe a pizza...perhaps an appetizer if we're good and hungry, and start hashing out ideas.  Hair Trigger, Mist, and Underbite were all products of those conversations.  Very proud of them."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Thanks so much for the detailed response! I'm really excited to eventually receive my re-release oh Kezia on vinyl!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I got the Volition song book a while ago, and its fantastic!  After ordering it, I found out that it was only tab and not tab and sheet music like the other song books.  Any plans to release a version with sheet music included?

Also what mystic river did you bathe in to gain the skill and power you have?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Glad you asked.  Leaving out the notation was a tough choice.  We ultimately decided that if we were going to be printing hundred of them (maybe even thousands), we should have some consideration for the amount of paper being used.  The standard notation just about doubles the amount of page space needed and we decided out main customer base were people who read tab.  I still think we are right about that, but I agree that we should offer the standard stuff for those go getters like yourself.  Look out for it in the future.


I generally bathe in a river of beer and sometimes vodka when I have the chance.  It seems to keep the evil thoughts at bay ;)"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Fair enough, thanks for getting back to me!
Also I should have known booze is always the answer.  Silly me.
"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Just saying I would sell my soul for a Kezia rock opera"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","haha - on the other hand you could develop one and then keep your soul?  ....didn't think so."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Yo Luke, when you and PTH gonna be passing through Thunder Bay again? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hard to say - TB is waaaay up there.  always a beautiful drive though.  As empty as the shows may be, I think we will all still enjoy playing there....and going to the casino."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Do you ever draw inspiration from albums that people wouldn't expect you to listen to? Also, what's your current jam? 

Edit: I've seen you guys live five times now, and you were the first band I hung out with backstage (this was the UK tour with Born Of Osiris quite a few years ago). Obviously this was when Moe and Arif were still in the band, but all of you guys were really cool and I'd just like to say thanks for being humble and all that lark. All the best!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Probably.  I often hear something on jazz or classical radio (91.1 for you gta people in the know) and want to know what was going on.  If I can safely do it, I grab shazam or make sure I listen to what it was.  Those genres are neat in that way, because looking up one tune might undercover dozens of renditions of the same song or standard.  I have definitely been surprised that simple ideas can often be the most mesmerizing and lasting.


Glad we could meet you and make an impression.  I hope we gave you a beer or two."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","First off, I just want to say thanks to you and your band for being the shit for so long. I've loved you guys since Kezia and my love got tripled when Yimmy gave me a signed copy of Volition in Dublin after I didn't get the CD sent out to me. Safe to say I died with happiness after that, probably the coolest thing ever.

One thing I've always wondered is where the line ""grateful you die by Irish steel"" in Limb from Limb came from? 
"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I am glad we were able to make it up to you.  Because we were on tour when volition was released - we had to use a third party shipper for some of the perks.  Not blaming them, but some didn't make it - so many reasons that could have happened.  We just want to make sure everyone who didn't get their perk does.  It's going to be something we chip away at for a long time, but we will never forget.


You will have to ask Arif about the Irish Steel line.  I think I know / remember but don't want to sound like a dummy.  I guess I should have considered that before taking on 500 questions eh?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hi there Truke! A couple of questions. You already mentioned that you had just started the writing process. How much do you (the band itself) usually take from the ""beginning"" till the ""end"" (release of the final album)? I guess I can't wait. Aside from that, is Cam your full-time bass player now that Riff is gone or would you search for another player? Can't wait to see y'all again in Spain :D"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","The time it takes always varies.  We want to try new ways of releasing music this time.  Although the plan is still to write our 5th full length album, it would be nice to release some single songs along the way (for pay what you can or something) just to keep things fresh.  It isn't often you have a band who are free to release whatever they want whenever they want without a label or manager intervening so we want to exploit that freedom.  Also, album versions of songs have been rethought and rehashed beyond belief by the time you guys hear them.  It might be cool to hear something less refined and raw from us.  Something that can stand on it's own and doesn't have to be a part of a giant opus!


Cam is like the fifth member / ghost now a days.  His true love is being a producer and mixing bands live.  Although he is a mean bass box, you have to respect when someone wants to do their first passion.  He is welcome as long as he wants to stay - but at some point that may involve finding a more permanent bass player, yes."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey man, just wondering what song in the entire PTH catalogue took the longest to write - either because of the difficulty or structure, etc.?

As an aside, I met you guys in Halifax when you were touring through Canada for Fortress. You guys kicked ass both performance wise and as people! Which leads me to another question - how do you like Nova Scotia? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","That's a tough quesiton because some of them were written so long ago.  I often find it's the first song we sit down to write for any given session.  I remember ""Tandem"" taking a light year.  It's one we have still never played live.  It is easily in my top 3 if not my favourite song we have written though.  


Love Nova Scotia.  Want to travel to halifax and be able to be a tourist / not have to play a show some time."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke,  what kind of picks do you like?  Normal sized. .mm... ? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I like Jazz III picks.  I have lots of friends / players in other bands who make fun of me for it though.  That have moved on to thinner picks - mainly because they are better than I on the instrument now!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Will you boys play Indiana soon? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We wont be playing anywhere soon for quite some time.  We try to hit them all eventually though!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, the last time I saw you guys live in DC Rody got all fired up after someone asked about A Life Embossed. It definatly pushed the show from good to great since Rody and everyone else seemed more pumped after Rody's rant. 

Is there something specific to you that fires you up during a show? Playing a certain song? or seeing something in the crowd?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Depends how you define ""fired up""...

If you mean like excited fired-up?  I would say when people are having a genuinely wonderful time and not just standing there scared cause it's a monday night and they have to work the next day

If you mean really angry fired-up? I would say it's when some asshole thinks we give a fuck about what they yell at us in between songs.  More so if they think anyone in the building gives a fuck.

Our shows are meant to be an open forum - if you have a great one liner or just want to hear a song - we get that all the time and generally will join you for a laugh.  It's the drunken repeat offenders who we would rather boot fuck out of the show and be happy they hate our band forever afterwards."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I meant excited fired-up. I think it's really cool that you guys' shows are like an open forum. It's definitely a unique experience and one of the reasons I ceaselessly talk up PtH.

You guys have seriously changed the way I look at music and writing. Your music really helped me find myself as a musician. I am eternally thankful for that. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Appreciate it.  Godspeed with everything."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","If you could choose to be one of The Avengers, why would you pick Iron Man?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Cause he is the only one that doesn't kind of suck?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","What music is most listened to on the road? Do you guys do stuff as a group outside of playing and writing music while out of town?

Please crowd fund another album, I'd rather give you my money than Sony, and play in Hamilton more."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We tend to all use headphones on the road now.  The last thing you want to do is hear music all the time.  That rule is thrown out the window if there are drinks flying around though - put on whatever you want and let's act like fools.


On tour we branch off into groups usually.  There is the coffee crowd, the drinkin' buddies, and the tourists.  You can be none or all of the above at any given time though.


I hope we do crowdfund the next album - but who knows at this point!


We are playing Hamilton on Feb 7th.  If you aren't there, I will be forced to disregard your suggestion in the future."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Which of your guitars is your favorite? What kind of pickups do you use? Have you ever had any talks with ibanez about an endorsement? And how are you liking the jump to Axe fx. 

Thanks for being one of the most creative guitar players and song writers! I'm looking forward to hearing the new album. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I mainly have Ibanez geets these days - they are my favourite and I endorse em fully.  Don't know which is my favourite - but the LACS and J-customs tend to play themselves.  Can you bug Ibanez to make a signature model?  They will never listen to just me.


Axe FX has been a cool change.  Miss tube amps but the axe just makes travelling a lot easier."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Thanks for the reply! I was surprised to get one after so long. If I could make the call I would get you a sig! Do you notice a difference between LACS and J custom? Which do you prefer? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I am going to be trolling these questions until I get to them all.  I know not everyone will see but it's important to me to make sure I give everyone some kind of response.


There is a big difference.  On one hand, you have the lacs stuff which is completely customized by me.  This is a great thing which I would never take for granted, but I am not some master luthier with tons of knowledge about guitar builds.  It's kind of guess and test as I go.  They turn out looking like works of art, but not sure everyone would love my wood choice, neck, bridge, yadda yadda.   I like to experiment and will always be looking for my perfect Ibanez axe I think.


J customs on the other hand are in my opinion the work of tons of years to perfect the highest end catalog models.  They truly are a treat to behold.  I would be smart to design my lacs models after the jcustoms I think.
"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, I've seen you guys play a bunch of times throughout the years and you fucking rock. I was wondering, do you remember playing a tiny impromptu set at club Ansinthe in Hamilton around the time Fortress was coming out? I was at the bar with Dan Fila (he was my buddy's music teacher) and we loved it. You guys were drunk as fuck but I think it may have been the first time Bloodmeat was played? Anyways keep writing awesome shit man"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I have nightmares about that ""impropmtu set"" - I remember not knowing how to the hold the guitar that's how boozed I was.  I tried so hard to get out of that bbut remember Juice looking at me and saying ""pooky, there is no way you are getting out of this"" and then he threw me up on stage.  what a night!
Tell Dan we say hi!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hi luke. I Just wnna know : since protest is a big famous band... Whats your opinion about te music industry in these days?? I mean, do you prefer been an indepent band, check for yourself all these booking stuff and merch? Or it has been a better deal with the record label (dont know the name of yours) i have a band, and we're about to start a tour. Saludos desde México. Hope some day we can light a joint together jaja"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We are enjoying being independent now but we wouldn't have gotten here without labels.  Now a days, bands can take a serious run at a career on their own (if they are good).  Just take the time to learn all the steps as you go because when you are independent one day, you will be ready to start pwning everything on your own."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Wow! Thank you luke! I was so happy when i saw you answer. We're doing our best to go on and on. Hope some day we can share rock stage! thanks for your time. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, 

Just a question from a huge fan from the GTA:

I saw you guys at the Danforth Music Hall last month and was pretty hyped at seeing Jadea and Kayla joining you on stage. What are the chances that you guys could get Moe and Arif back for a song or two (or, y'know, a whole night)? 

(No disrespect to Cam or Mike, either, its just that 8/10 times I've seen you, it was the original lineup (with Cam working merch) and I think it'd be cool to see the same 5 guys I saw in like '08 or '09 play through Blinfolds Aside)"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I think it might be to fresh and recent to drag those guys back up on stage.  We kicked around the idea of having both those guys come back for a song but I think the divorce is still too new.  I don't mean a yucky divorce either - it was amicable and the right way to go for everyone.  Maybe one day.


Jadea and Kayla did a smash up job just like we knew they would.  I remember Kayla showed up after sound check and we asked her if she wanted to rehearse her section.  She laughed at us and grabbed a beer."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","when are you guys coming back to toronto!!! "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","we live in toronto!  I am sure we'll see you around."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, reinforce my opinions here
Kezia &gt; Fortress &gt; Volition &gt; Scurrilous (they're all great, but you gotta rank em)"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Scurrilous&gt;Volition&gt;Fortress&gt;Kezia

Kezia is a potpourri of mindless noodling and overplaying.  Can't believe anyone still enjoys it hahah.  

But seriously, definitely the weakest album from a ""musician's"" standpoint."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","lol literally the opposite, ouch. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I like the noodling, plus it was some of rodys best singing (at least for what I like), plus the great story"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","When are you guys gonna do reprints of past merch? I bought one of your shirts, the turquoise one covered in lude sex acts, lost it, and have been searching for it since. Please let me know as it was my least favorite shirt fuck you."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","That shirt was the best.  I am sure I can dig up the print file if you wanna create a one off for yourself?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","That would be fucking amazing!! Used to wear that shirt to school, nobody ever noticed just how graphic was until I pointed it out. Even teachers, haha."

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! I have participated in the crowdfunding to make ""Volition"" come true. I got a really kickass shirt and holy shit, the music is just amazing. 
All the attention you had during the campaign to the fans were just incredible.
I don't have anything to ask really, bit I wanna thank you and the band for making the music I love!

Oh right, any chance of coming to play in Brazil?

"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Thank you for your support.  It means the world to us.    I hope we can continue to impress you somehow.

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, 
I am not trying to ask you to step on anyone's toes, but who is your favorite band to tour with?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I honestly have enjoyed the company of 95% of the bands who we have been lucky enough to tour with.  We have a special bond with the Safety Fire since they never seem to fuck off from every tour we ever do.  Seriously amazing people and proud to call em my friends.  Noiche ye!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I've noticed that almost before every song you play live you practice a riff from it with the volume off right before starting. Is it like a nerve/OCD thing?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","shit!  you noticed that eh?
I think it's so I don't confuse it with another riff.  Some of our songs start similarly - If you ask Rody, he will tell you they are all the same from start to finish.  I just do it to jog my memory - but it could have become an ocd thing over the years too.  "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey luke can you and tim come give me a guitar lesson. I bought your volition tab book at the toronto show and its challenging. So yeah bring everyone over. No drugs/alcohol though and mandatory prayers/bible readings every hour on the hour got it?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Okay.  So condoms or no condoms?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke,
Any of you guys game?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Video games, not really.  Although gta5 calls out to me all the time.  I have to fight picking up the controller.

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","At this point, the guy has to hate that song with a fiery passion.  Everywhere he goes one or two people yell it at him or bust out acoustic guitars and play it....the whole way through.  If he paid me enough, I would learn it."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, love PTH, the St. John's show of the Newfoundland tour was the best concert I've ever been to. Any chance of coming back to the island soon?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","That one really was special for all of us I think.  Loved the projection images behind us when I got a chance to glance around.  I don't know when we will be back, but it would certainly be cool to get there again within this year!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Man, having both PTH, and great movies at the same time was so great!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Ayy Luke! 

Do you know the pressing colors for the coming repress of your albums? Grabbed a copy of Fortress last time, it sounds great!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I do know the colours yes.  But I don't want to give them away yet.  We kept is classy for Kezia, got quite splattery with fortress, and went all out weird on scurrilous.  I can't wait to see them."

What's your favorite part about Scotland or coming to the UK in general?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","My favourite part about scotland is an actual guy named Scott who does our merch for us.  Aside from being a great person, hilarious fella, and insane drinker...he treats his job so professionally while remembering to always treat people at the show with respect.  That's something merch guys don't always care about.


Also - our shows in scotland are almost always a blast!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Yeah the merch guy in vancover last trip through was a fucking dick. Seriously he should eat shite sandwiches"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke,  

Just a real quick question for ya. Why do you love Newfoundland so much? I am trying to plan a trip out to the maritimes this year and the level of interest the band shows for Newfoundland has always intrigued me. BTW you guys rock and if I do go out there I'll definitely be listening to mist while we enjoy the beautiful scenery. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","It's probably one of those places you just have to go and experience before you get it.  Nicest people, best albeit very small downtown area.  The ocean, the wildlife, the scenery, the food.  It never ends."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","How do you feel about Billy Talent? :D"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I think they are great.  Found a nice niche between mainstream music and keeping their integrity.  I can't think of another band that sounds quite like em.  "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Sooo.....what's up with the fear of nightly bees?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","haha I answered this earlier and it was pretty long winded.  Try scrolling up a couple hundred questions and you should find it."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! How many hours a day worth of practice would you recommend? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I used to practice a lot.  Working on technique and what have you.  Now a days when I pick up a guitar, it's generally time to write stuff.  I gotta be honest, it's more fun than practicing.  On tour though, I warm up and practice monotonous stuff a lot.  It keeps me sane.
Number of hours = how ever much you think it takes to really improve on something...anything...even just a little."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Just wanted to say it was a real honour to meet you at the Hard Rock Cafe in Toronto and have you watch my band play. You are one of my biggest idols. Keep up the good work. -Andrew of MLFH"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Fella, 
It was cool for me too - it was such a random drop in for me and it was a nice surprise to watch you guys and have free drinks somehow.  I really enjoyed it - hope you are still doing your thing."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! Pretty nice of you to pop in for an AMA. 

I've been a huge fan for quite a while and you guys have a very special place deep down in my heart...I remember that the very first metal show that I have attended was a tour that you did with Between the Buried and Me, Killswitch Engage and In Flames. At that show, I bought 3 Protest the Hero shirts because PTH designs were the most fabulous designs.

Now on to the questions : 
If you could play in any other bands, what would it be? 
Do you rather play inside a venue or outside during a festival?
What's your favorite band to tour with?

On a side note.. Does Rody still rips his shirt during shows? Every time I've seen you guys at a festival he rips his shirt. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey, thanks for grabbing those shirts - it's pretty much the main reason we can afford to keep playing.


I would definitely want to play in something a little more held back.  Although I love playing in p-test, mainly because of it's challenges, it can becomes stressful over the course of a long tour.  It's a lot of notes to play (or fuck up) every nights and if you think about it too much, it can weigh on you.


The tighter and more intimate the venue, the better for me.  I love stages which are not elevated above the crowd.  Well maybe a little bit so that everyone can see, but not much.  Inside is definitely better for me.  Playing outside at a festival in the sun at 1:00 pm feels totally wrong!


I can honestly say that 95% of the bands we have toured with have been amazing people - or in the 5%ers defence, the tour was too short or hectic to get to know each other.  Although I would have a tough time saying my absolute favourite, the bands we have toured with multiple times are generally my favourite because we have more time to hang out and get to know one another."

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Frankly Luke, I miss seeing Riffs happy face on stage. Knowing one day he'll back playing with his pals would put me at ease.
No details this? 

&amp; also what's your favorite color?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Colours: green and blue


I miss seeing him out there too - but we played so many shows together I will never regret the time we both put in.  Sometimes, you have to do something that makes you happy - and often, once you have done something for so long, it's time for something new.  I have had an awesome outlet with Sheet Happens Publishing.  I am able to split my days between the two giant projects.  Arif's outlet was and is playing with other acts, doing plays, etc.  I am just glad we both have found outlets which are still creative and musical!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","How do you play the arpeggios in Bone Marrow so cleanly? I can't seem to get them no matter how much I practice."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","they are fast enough that you can't hear the mistakes my friend..."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I saw you in Jacksonville, FL last year and it was incredible. My boyfriend's prog band is releasing their first album on Saturday, what tips can you give to them about finding success when just starting out?

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","7 years ago i purchased the same model ibanez as you had back in the day. S series 470. You had the green, and i saw you sold it and i missed out. Im a huge fan of yours and have been to more than 10 of your shows in toronto. Just wondering if you have plans on selling any of your other guitars in the future. It would mean the world to me to have a guitar used by you. Not going to lie, your the reason i picked up a guitar brother!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I only ever sell a beloved guitar if I really need the money.  It hurts me every time I need to do it.  However, I am hoping that one day I can sell one for someone or something who needs the money more than me.  I think I would feel a lot better about it for those reasons.  I hope you get one of those!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, 

1. Would you guys ever consider re-recording some songs off of The Calculated Use of Sound? A few songs on there would sound amazing with the band's now more technical sound.

2. Now that The Fall of Troy is back together doing some tours, might there be a chance that you and TFOT could do a tour together? *Please?*"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We have touched on the subject before.  It might be tough to make em that much more interesting and we would risk re doing them just to rip some hard solos here and there that we couldn't pull off back then hahaha.  (hard-solos is a great term)


We would all love to tour with TFOT again."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Holy shit, I didn't expect a reply. Thanks!

I'll see you guys next time y'all come to Louisiana!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, big fan of your guitar work. I've purchased all your books and learned every song. I play in a band and we sound a lot like protest, there's nothing I can do about it. I always wondered though, what band, philosophy,musician, or drug trip inspired you to write such difficult, nonsensical, awesome riffs on fortress. 
Thanks"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","The Fortress writing days were pretty focussed.  I and Rody lived in whitby at the time (with our parents), and I used to get up every morning pretty early and play guitar for 2-3 hrs before heading over to pick up rody.  Then we would listen to music on the trip into the city every day talking about what we could rip off (a lot of it from the radio haha).  We drank a lot of coffee, beer, and I remember a container of discarded cigarette butts which might fill a pool - but not too heavy on the drugs.  Those days were pretty open, we were just trying to do our own thing and blow our first album out of the sky.  I guess the philosophy was something like ""anything is possible"" as lame as that sounds.  There were no limitations or standards.  It was great.


Thank you for grabbing the books.  It means a lot."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke !!! I've been playing guitar for 7 years now...A question..I'm thinking about trying something new and picking up a cello to try and learn...any tips for someone learning a brand new instrument, also if you had to stop playing guitar what other instrument calls your name ? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I thought about that too for a while (violin over cello), but it never happened.  I guess it would be something I might try if I couldn't play the geet anymore.  I have heard it's a frustrating / challenging road though - I would have been more hungry in my younger days!
God speed sir..."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, cheers from Israel!
You're by far my favorite band. any chance you'll be visiting Israel for a show anytime soon?
What about a tour in Europe? planning one anytime soon?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We did three tours in Europe for the Volition album cycle.  That is a lot for any band to do from North America.  


We would love to come to Israel to play a show - that's something arif was very vocal about doing.  We are pretty much down to play anywhere these days no matter how far away it is.  Hopefully we might see you there one day."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke,

Saw you guys live in Halifax NS during Rock the Hill, was actually more pumped to see you guys than Metallica, it was a wicked show! 

I've been playing guitar for about 10 years now, and just recently started tackling your songs. I've watched video lessons that you and Tim did on Youtube and was just wondering in C'est La Vie during the verse, theres a lot of jumping around. How did you practice this? Just do it really slowly or is there a special technique you did to help you?

Thanks again, and can't wait for the next album! "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","That's awesome that you were there.  I remember playing as sideways rain was flying in our faces.  What a shot day for a show eh?  My favourite was being able to get everything off stage, crack a beer and watch Coheed play.  What a treat!


If my memory serves me, that verse is pretty scaler?  It's pretty much a harmonic minor scale haha!  It might jump around but is all based on octaves.  You got this brother and/or sister."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","[deleted]"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, you write some awesome shit. couple questions though:

1. how do you write guitar parts? do you take bits of chords and string them together or what? im a bassist looking for guitarists but id like to be able to write out guitar parts a little more.

2. Favorite axe? 

3. How did the original PTH get together?

thanks for your time and keep doing what youre doing!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I answered the riff writing stuff quite a bit already.  But if you get Guitar Pro (6 is the latest version), it will help you with your writing.  You can even start with bass ideas and branch out into as many guitar tracks as you want.  It definitely helped me with everything and has for years.


Fav Axe: my Ibanez LACS models


Pth got together while in public school.  That is not a type we have been playing together since grade 8.  Frightening to think about!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Given that your songs are progressive and almost nothing is repeated, when do you decide that a song is finished and doesn't need another riff or part added to it?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I think that was something we definitely focused on in the past.  Every part should be new, repeating a part is a ""no-no"".  That is definitely something that we have grown out of.  We still enjoy a progressive outlook on a song or album as a whole, but there is nothing wrong with repetition if it's a great part / riff.  Fear not, there is always going to be a song or two we really go for the progressive sound - they just take forever!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Blindfolds Aside or Limb From Limb?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Limb from Limb - that blatant Mastodon rip off riff is my favourite."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke. A couple of questions i forgot to ask at the Edinburgh M&amp;G if you wouldn't mind:

1. How're you guys feeling about the reunion of SikTh? Think there might be potential for that UK tour together you missed out on years ago? 
2. How do you guys go about playing with the backing tracks live? Is it an ipod panned click track and the backing panned to the other side or something similar? I'm trying to figure out the best way to do the same thing for my band. 

`Michael"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Who could be upset that Sikth is getting back together??  Not us!
It would be great to play a show, tour, or album cycle with them ahha - I think the shows would go over really well.


Playing with backing tracks has been a struggle for us to say the least.  None of us want to, but we feel we need to incorporate parts played by album guests if they cannot come with us.  I have no idea how they are triggered hahah - just a sampler I think.  Other bands use laptops, but that's for running some serious backing tracks with lots of stems / tracks.  We will never be that band."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Have you got any tours/shows around planned?

Portugal would like to have you visit!
"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","No plans to head back to Portugal yet, but we all love it there.  I once vacationed after a tour there and it was amazing.  Maybe a little too young and stupid to make the best of it, but I hope I get a second chance!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","There's always hope! Glad you enjoyed yourself during your stay, wish you the best mate"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Will you give me some of your guitar skills? I gots none. :'("
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","trade me for a better hairline?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Is there any interest from you or the other band members to contribute more to the lyric writing process? It seemed like Rody had a lot of fun and got a lot of praise after taking over for Arif. 
"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I don't think any of us want to mess with a good thing.  Although they come from completely different places, Rody and Arif are both great lyricists.  I can relate to Rody's a little more and therefor am very happy with our writing set up moving forward."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! I'm curious, are we ever going to get bass tabs to the albums?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","The Volition Bass Book should be out in March (latest).  We are also doing a drum book for it.  And a complete score kind of thing for all you GP nerds out there.

[Sheet Happens Publishing](http://sheethappenspublishing.com)	

It is harder to go back in time with the bass books because stems are hard to come by, and trust me, our memories fade faster than you can say...."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey luke!
Just wondering, between you and tim who does the finger picking on the acoustic for tracks like blindfolds aside, mist, skies etc."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","hey luke, i'm gonna be a dick and try to squeeze in two questions for the price of one.
A. for a nerdy dude in med school who doesn't get a lot of playing time any longer, any particular scales, fingering exercises, or tips on how to try to continue developing all skills, but speed in particular?
2. when you guys are writing, is there a formula or rule of thumb you use for coming up with a way to transition from one riff to another that  may be in a different key or time signature or just way different sounding from the previous line?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke,
     What's your usual preshow/general warmup? You have a lost of fast blues scale and diminished runs, although I'm more familiar with the material off of Fortress to be honest. But I've always wondered what you all do to prepare before shows, with what seems to be more tedious practice riffs at crazy tempos. I hope this wasn't vague or that you got the wrong idea haha. Any word on Cam's or Arif's warmup/practice routine would be amazing as well. I'm more of a bassist than a guitarist. Thanks for making it through this long message!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Couldn't think of a question just wanted to say been a fan since the release of Blindfolds Aside MV, saw you guys Dec 27th and y'all played amazingly one of the best concerts I've ever been too. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","[deleted]"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Why do you always use guitars that have tremolos on them? I've never heard any even light trem use in any PTH songs, just curious why have them at all?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","[deleted]"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! I've been listening to you guys since Kezia first hit the scene and PTH is by far my favorite band for a huge number of reasons. Thank you and the rest of the guys for making such meaningful/badass/mind-blowing material.

Is there anyway we (the fans) could convince you guys to re-record Kezia with todays technology? I listen to at least one song from that album every single day and I love it... but I always think to myself ""What would all of this sound like if it were recorded right after Volition?""

Also I'm curious - how are preorders going on the [next run of vinyls for the first 3 albums](http://www.kt8merch.com/store/pages/22255)? I made sure to get mine in but I was wondering how many you guys have since the initial 300 runs of each sold out within an hour. 

THANKS FOR BEING KICKASS! :D"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Just wanted to say that PTH is my all time favorite band, and of course you're one of my all time favorite guitarists. Scurrilous is one of the best albums in the history of time and it seriously helped me get through some really rough times after my mother's death from cancer in 2011. Can't wait till you guys come play in Atlanta again!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Are you guys going to do anything special for the ten year anniversary of Kezia? A re-record would be my dream come true"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Let me preface this by saying how awesome you are; I love your guitar playing.

I have two questions (or one question and one that's a series of smaller questions). 

The series of smaller questions is how do you all write your music? Do you write music that will sound good to you guys, or easy/fun to play live, etc? Do you write music with a specific time signature or time sig. changes or do you just go with the groove?

The second question is what's your favorite food?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Trukey! Wanted to get your opinion on the new Periphery album. Thoughts? Likes? Dislikes?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Sup Luke! If you could have one guitar lesson with anybody alive, who would it be and what would you want to learn?

Also i cant believe i missed protest in vancouver last year. I got my special my tshirt and album from the volition kickstart (or whatever site it was) campaign. I wore it when i met Dream Theater and the band and lots of fans have huge respect for you guys! Lots of good comments :)"

"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","When did you start playing guitar and how much did you practice to get to the point you're at now? Did you learn much in terms of theory? Also if I'm ever wandering around Whitby will I possible bump into you guys? :P I'm from Trenton so I'm not too far away, aha. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Who's Idea was it to cover NOFX?  Man, when you played Linoleum a the hoseshoe I lost my mind.
Also, any chance that you will pull out anything from A Calculated use of sound in the live show now that Arif is gone, or was our last chance for that that club show in toronto a few years back?"

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hi Luke! What are some bands you enjoy that may not receive enough or any(!) marketing or exposure?

Been a fan since the week Fortress was released. I saw you guys in Tulsa, OK w/ AILD, THA, and MyChildren a few years back, and loved the show! Even though Arif's entire bass rig seemed to die during the last song. :O

Thanks for all the music you've been a part of. Music is love, life, and medicine."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I know it's obviously a long time before you're thinking of doing another tour but will you come back to England for more shows?

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! Just want to say I remember the 2nd time I went to see you guys live (3 times so far) It was in Ottawa at Mavericks I think. I got to take a pic with Tim &amp; chilled with Moe outside, After talking to Moe for a bit he decided to head to the tour bus so I asked him If he could get you to come outside and take a picture (You being my favorite guitarist) I waited a few seconds and sure enough you walked out of the bus with smile to take a picture. Just wanted to say Thank you for that, Because I know that it's not everyone who would've done that after a really long show everyone was pretty tired. You're Awesome! I'll never forget that. "

I've been using your songs as a way to improve my guitar skills and honestly, i've been seeing quite some improvement and they're so freaking fun to play! so first, i'd like to thank you for that and creating such epic music \m/ so, 1st: do you have any exercises, routine or anything to improve your guitar playing you could share? and 2nd: do you ever plan to come to portugal? chill mate!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! Who are your favorite bands/artists currently?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! I saw PTH in Kingston- got really trashed and had an awesome time. I just have two questions for you:

-How old were you when you all started working on Kezia? 

-What was something wacky that happened to you while abroad this year?

Thanks for the great music man! Here's hoping I see you guys again soon!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey man. Big Protest fan here. Volitions is one of my favorite metal albums and Chris Adler knocked the drum tracks out of the park. How was working with him in the studio? Was there time to just sit back and talk and chill with him or was it straight up just lay tracks and leave?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","My buddy Chris gave you an enormous essay when you guys were playing a show in Florida. Did anybody ever read that?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I've seen you guys three times live now, most recently at the Wolverhampton gig back in November. Firstly just wanted to say I adore your passion and playing and thanks for all the great experiences you've given me.

Would it be possible to bring vinyl pressings to England next time you tour in Europe? I already have the Volition edition from your crowdsourcing effort, but due to high import costs have been unable to purchase any others!

Thanks!"

Here is me with the lovely Timmy. I just wanted to say that I appreciate the amounts of effort you put into your playing and the meaning behind your songs. Our conversation really helped me buck up my own writing, so thank you!

If I have to think of a good question to ask to keep your attention, I'll ask, how do you get the inspiration to write strange riffs in odd time signatures? I try my hardest to experiment and with some difficulty, it might come out well. What is your writing method with time signatures?"

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","He can do a lot of burpees. I've seen it"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke,

I was just wondering how you guys tend to settle/come up with song titles. Is there much thought put into it or is it pretty instantaneous, like ""That seems like the right name"". Who tends to come up with the titles? I guess this goes for album titles as well. 

I was just wondering since you guys have some pretty unique track names. I remember coming across Fortress and being struck by Bloodmeat. It's so self-explanatory but also really bizarre. Meaty blood - marinara with meat sauce. 

Random aside - I remember when you guys opened for Dragonforce at the Agora in Cleveland like 8-10 years ago and your snare drum broke or something, but you decided to keep going anyway even as the crowd grew kind of hostile and started booing. I always felt bad about that, but thanks for still coming back to Cleveland!"

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Kezia is probably one of my favorite albums of all time. Will The Divine Suicide of K ever rejoin the set? 

Also please please please tour with BTBAM and melt all of our collective faces."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hi there Luke! Big fan - only got into you guys with the release of Voilition but went back to all the earlier stuff and am now totally sold, you guys are extremely talented and a damn good jam.

You and Tim both have quite a distinctive tone with a lot of midrange presence. What was the motivation behind having such a prominent midrange in a genre where most bands prefer a scooped sound?
And hell, whilst we're at it, I know you were using a Splawn Nitro - what's in your current rig?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, no question from me.  Just wanted to say that Protest has been my favourite band since I was 14 and that might not sound like much, but it's eerie to think I've been listening to you guys for 1/3 of my life.  Thank you and everyone else who works with you for putting out fantastic music.  I can't find the originality that I find with Protest anywhere else.  You guys are the best.

"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Thanks for doing this Luke. I bought the tab books from sheet happens a few years ago - thanks for tabbing your music out and shipping to little old England. :o)

If you're still around, what's your favourite thing to practice? A specific song? Or perhaps a specific scale that you like to noodle around in?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Probably a bit late in the AMA to catch you, but...

Protest has one of the qualities I most love in a band, and by that I mean you guys, even as one of my favorite bands, still have so much potential. A big part of why I'm so excited by what you guys do is that I always feel like you're on the verge of the next great idea in your canon; something beyond what you've already done.

One such thing I'm often curious about is the use of additional instrumentation, particularly the acoustic guitar, piano, and string-driven passages in your albums. Even Jadea Kelly could be included in this regard. My question is, do you guys ever contemplate composing music that more thoroughly embraces instrumentation outside of the standard rock combo? I'm obviously not advocating you write ""Every Rose Has Its Thorns"" or some shit, but I hear those passages like the ones at the end of ""Mist"" or ""Blindfolds Aside"" and they really move me.

**TL;DR**, Could you ever see Protest the Hero further embracing instrumentation outside of the standard guitar/bass/drums rock format for full-length songs?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke love your work thank you for your time. 

Have you heard anything about Rocksmith? The game that teaches you how to play guitar. I am a big gamer and it peaked my interest as something to get me over the hump of learning an instrument. Would love to know any thoughts you had on it? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Which section gave you the most trouble when it came around to learning and tightening up PoT material? What aspect of it made you struggle and how did you overcome your initial issues with it?

Second, which riff/section that you have wrote is your favourite and why?

Thanks! 

PS: Protest are next-level incredible and you are awesome! "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Kezia was, and is, one of the shreddiest, technically laden albums I've heard all around, was it a conscious decision to make it that way? Coming off of the other albums, which to me sound more drawn back to a degree, how do you look back at it?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","My name is also lucas. I play guitar. Havr you accepted i am the superior lucas?"

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I know you guys are really proud of the music you've put out (as you should), but I've heard a few times that there are some guitar sections in your songs that you regret writing because they're such a pain in the ass to play live (like those stupid fast triplet runs in Sequoia Throne). So what's your least favourite riff to play from your discography?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","First thing, not a question, you're a sexy beast.

Now, the question(s), if I'm not mistaken you guys came to Brazil back in 2012, do you guys plan on coming back anytime soon? Also, how does it feel to play outside of North America? Do you feel like the response from the audience is different?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, huge fan, I've been going to your shows since the days of The Dungeon in Oshawa.

I started playing guitar almost 7 months ago and I started with Sequoia Throne.. Which was probably a bad choice, but whatever. I'm almost done with the song but I'm struggling to get [a few parts up to 100% speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwld4kmCmec). 

Were there any exercises in particular that you worked on for your speed? 

And are you offering in-person lessons at the moment? I've tried going to your bandhappy page but that site always seems to time-out for me. 

PS. I'm over in Peterborough and the last show you guys played here was ridiculously good."

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","You were at the Toronto Maximum the Hormone show a few years ago, right? I think we talked about you guys touring together. I'm sad that never happened."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hello Luke, Big fan. Do you see yourself continuing to write more polished sounding records? Just a a personal taste thing for me, but some modern metal band's guitars sound too much like synths to me. I love your guitar tones and mixing job done on scurrilous.  "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Do you think you guys will ever re-release all of 'A Calculated Use of Sound,' even if it's just digitally? I'd buy that, yo. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Any chance you guys would play through an entire album live? It could be any of them, I just think it'd be cool to see that"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I know you guys in PTH fucking love your beer. 

So what's your favourite fucking beer? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey, Luke! First off, you're a huge inspiration, and in my opinion, one of the greatest guitarists to ever live. Among the many questions I have, I'll narrow it down to three.
1. You have a rediculous tapping technique, any tips at all for speed and jumping around the strings would be amazing.
2. Who were some of your biggest influences on the guitar?
3. Have you and Tim ever thought of jumping up to 7-strings as many in your genre have done? I'm a pretty big fan of both styles; you guys can do more with 6 than most can with 8. Cheers! Hope to see you in NY at some point soon!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","When VH1 eventually makes a Behind the Music about you will the period between Scurrilous and Volition be the dramatic part they flash forward to before each commercial to keep you watching? Or was it not that bad?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! I always wonder what you and the rest of the guys do when you're not doing band stuff, any hobbies you do on the side?? Huge props on staying original through the years man, keep up the good work:D "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hi Luke, I would like to know what riff/solo/lick/part of a song struck you as ""wow, fuck thats good. We've gotta include that"" as you were writing it or even something that came spur of the moment that you really thought was great. 

PS: Play absolutely as many home town T.O shows as you can, theres something about seeing you guys in Toronto that makes me really proud and happy PTH is from here."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! 

I am curious what you think of the Exes for Eyes #ThePlatinumProject, Or if you have even heard about it? (link to their update https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJyhwQfUNvQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) 

Whats your opinion on underground bands taking this route to distributing their music?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Luke! I must know your thoughts on tone!
I've been listening to you guys since about about 08' and and you guys have been my favorite ever since. What REALLY gets PtH to ignite a flame into my soul (and not to mention give me some crackhead-like air guitar when I'm walking outside) is how you really sound to my ears. You and Tim got really know your sound expectations. 

What's your EQ set up usually like for shows?

There's something about players that have these perfect groovy and melodic chops combined with this clean distorted solid tone. People that come to mind off the top are like Alan Holdsworth, Paul Waggoner, and Mario Camerena from Chon. 

What is some groovy music that you listen to that may inspire some of the chops you have?

What are some exercises that become really cool skills after mastered?

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Just wanted to say I was very proud to be a part of your crowd funding effort on Volition and am a happy owner of the vinyl! When you write songs how do you know when you're done? Do you abide by any formula when constructing riffs?"

I guess something I've always wanted to know is, how often is it a conscious decision to write parts that reference old songs on your recent stuff?
First one that comes to mind is the ""We are, we are, we are still alive"" bit on Animal Bones, Are there other little nuggets we might have missed that are less obvious?


Also sometime back in 2008 - '09 Rody showed us he got a pink belly button piercing when he was wasted, how's it healing?"

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Luke, a while back some of you guys did some online lessons on some website I forgot all about. Would you be willing to ever do something like that again? I'm in a huge rut with guitar right now, and you are by far my favorite player. I can learn songs that are on a similar level of difficulty as your stuff, but at the same time PtH songs are so... WEIRD that it is hard to grasp how it all comes together when you learn it part by part. 

I really look forward to eventually seeing you guys live, so far you've not come anywhere near me in the states. &lt;/3"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Just wanted to say I really love your work man. I love all the albums, but I think I'm gonna have to say the Fortress is my favorite one. I love the grand nature of the Lyrics and I feel like the combo of the music and lyrics on this album paints epic pictures in my head better than any of the rest. It is a solid piece of brutal, classical infused, high art. I got it when it first came out and it hasn't gotten old to me yet. Thanks!!

Can't wait for another album. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Have you listened to Destrage? Because PTH sounds similar to them in its own way. maybe its the singing style but I dunno, check them out if you feel like it.

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","my question, who are some of your favorite artists outside of the rock and metal genres? 

thanks for doing this Luke. Got the pleasure of meeting you after a show you did at the Granada in Lawrence, Kansas around the time Scurrilous was released. My friend and I got to meet you, Rody, and Moe out back afterwards (not sure where Arif and Tim were at), our picture came out sorta blurry and when we mentioned that Rody looked over at you and said something like ""It totally captures the moment, we're blurry people!"" to which you agreed, it was pretty hilarious.

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Ok Lucas, here's the plan:
1- Start a fundraiser to get Arif back to pth.
2- Give 300k to Arif.
3- No one would turn down that offer.
4- ?????
5- Everyone will be happy."

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! Imma big ol' PTH fan here. I'm also a writer and the plot line for Kezia has always intrigued me although I've never quite understood it, can you maybe give me a brief explanation or tell me which lyrics help explain it?

btw my favorite live show ever was when y'all were in Baton Rouge, LA w/ battlecross "

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke!  I saw your show in Boston with TSF, Battlecross, and Intervals, and it was absolutely kickass, so thanks for that.

How old were you guys when Kezia was written/recorded?  Did being that young / in school affect the songwriting, structural, and musical decisions made on that album?

What is your favorite PTH album and why?

What is the best riff you have ever written?

Why was To Porter, With Love not included in the English version of Scurrilous?

Any chance you guys could throw a remake of ""Is Anyone There?"" or ""These Colours Don't Run"" our way?  That would be ideal.

And, finally, what is Drumhead Trial about?

Thanks!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero.

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey fellow,

Around the time you released Kezia, how much time did you all spend practicing each week, both individually and as a band? You all were pretty young (16, 17?) and I know plenty of players in their 20s who'd struggle to play those songs on their own, let alone pull them off as a band in a live setting."

Apologies for the late post. Blame the stupid South African time zone.

That said I have three questions:
1: Will the set-list be public knowledge?
2: Will it include Mist? My face is in need of a good melting.
3: Can I buy you guys a round of beers after the show?

Sincerely

I just want to say how much I love the lyrics in your songs, especially the ultra-feminist ones. ESPECIALLY Turn Soonest To The Sea. I think it's my favourite. It's rare to find a metal band that seems to really support feminism, by that I mean you're the only one I've found. Ever. Besides your unique sound and serious talent and skills, this is what made you guys really stand out to me. Your feminism; portrayed by dripping sarcasm and angry accusations. I love you.

last december I saw you guys live in Karlsruhe and we hung out till about 2 o'clock. [Here's a picture of you, tim and dez from the safety fire with us.](http://i.imgur.com/KpvYWzo.jpg)  
I'm the guy und the bottom right.

Now my question is this:  
Can you name the 15 albums/eps/singles, that are currently without much thinking about it, the closest to your heart? Just 15 releases that come to mind that you absolutely love. There can be several releases from one band, too.

Thanks for everything. You guys are great :)"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! Saw you guys live in Germany (first time i saw a band live) and it was amazing.
To get to the questioning part:
  What gave you the idea(s) for Kezia? I mean how'd you guys get to the thought of linking the songs together story-like?
"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke! First off I want to say that you guys have been a huge inspiration to me, and I love the music down to every note. I have a few questions.
With Arif and Moe gone, do you think the style of future albums with be any different from your past albums? Will we see more acoustic pieces? More American Tours (especially in Missouri?;) )
I think it would be great to see a ""reworked"" version of ACUOS, not that I don't love the original, but I think that it'd be really interesting to see how the band's sound has evolved. Thank you! Keep on melting faces and kicking ass!

And by the way, saw you guys in Norway when you were there.
Awesome show, you're a mean guitar machine!"

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Luke! Big time fan and fellow Whitby native! Are you a member of the Canadian beard olympic team?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I went to a show in Reno to see you guys, must've been a few years back. My friends and I got kinda lost and stumbled upon your bus. I knocked on the door and one of you opened the door. Thinking quick, I made an offering of the two girls I was with. You politely declined and gave us directions to the small venue (it was actually a bar.) After the show you signed both my friend's boobs.

Do you remember that night? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","I didn't think you'd actually keep answering all the questions but since it looks like you might I'll toss a late one in.

I think I read somewhere that you guys had 3 extra songs off scurrilous that didn't make the cut, one being To Porter With Love and then two others. Are you planning on releasing the other two at any point? 

Thanks for making such great tunes and treating your fans so well! Come back to Winnipeg whenever you can, we can't get enough of you guys over here. 
"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Might be too late but hey. . I was part of the Volition crowd funding. . Why is my name the only one with non capitals on the record.. It's cool but I was like wtf... oh Btw met you.. Love you"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Very late to the party and little thought of you seeing this, but after reading the ama a few days ago I really started listening to your music beyond the handful of songs I knew and had marked as favorites on Spotify. 

Enjoying the shit out of it and decided to try and learn at least a riff or two. The ending of The Divine Suicide of K almost made me tear up, so decided to try that song first. My hands and head hurt and I'm only somewhat clean at 25% speed. It's amazing you did this at such a young age. Massive respect.

So, a question: a: play more in Sweden? We did give you Mats Sundin so... 😉"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Are you guys gonna be in Indianapolis or Southern Florida anytime soon?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Why is the intro to Limb from Limb (or outro to Palms read) not on the instrumental version of Fortress? It's seriously the best intro you guys have ever done."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","everything you guys make is awesome but is there a chance of doing something live from a calculated use of sound, its my favourite also is there anywhere I could buy an lp of it."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hey Luke, my name is Mathew. This warm summer night here in old dusty ass AZ, you played at Club Red. Whilst listening to the last band perform before you and the rest of p-test hit the stage, I recall peaking back stage. We locked eyes, I had no shirt on at the time so you gave me a weird forwarded brow. But I believe a star was born that night. "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Honestly, it's tough to look away from shirtless dudes.  Obviously we all understand that fact.  I am glad we made something special big fella!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Luke!  You are my hero.  

Can you please tell me what is your methodology to picking your tone? I'm especially talking about your live tone where I know you don't change your tone that much between sections of the song.  Whenever I try to play your songs, I notice i'm either not using enough gain and then the tapping parts kind of fade out quickly or I use too much gain and it just sounds messy.   I have the exact same Ibanez s5470 as you have too with some barknuckle pickups and I find that despite the awesome playability of the guitar, the sustain isn't really the greatest"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","The S guitars definitely forfeit some sustain for the thinness of the body.  I moved over to RG guitars mainly for that reason.  That and they began to feel like a toy when I played them on stage and it got uncomfortable.
A kids hairband will generally help with the two hand tapping stuff.  You just have to get used to sliding here around!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Ahh that makes sense.. As far as tone goes what is your 'philosophy' on what makes good guitar tone?  Do you like mostly mids, some bass, little treble?  And what kind of effects do you use live that contribute to your unique sound, if any(i.e compressor, overdrive pedal, etc.)?

Thanks for responding!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Truke! I have a couple gear questions. What do you like about the Ibanez S series over the regular bodied line? Also, what pickups are you using nowadays? Your tone on Volition was absolutely monstrous!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Volition tone was mainly a re-amped axe fx.  We took DI signal while recording and ended up not being too happy with the final tone.  So we re amped it.  I am happy with how it came out, but would go for a more natural / organic tube tone next time I think.  Or maybe mix the two tones more.


I use predominantly RG series guitars now.  I like them for their bigger bodies, and sustain.  I haven't used S series on stage for years.  However, they will always be the ultimate couch writing guitars for their size, shape, and playability."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Just wanted to let you know I took part in the Volition crowdfund and preordered the entire discography on vinyl (Volition also) last week!

Stay cool!"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","yes, luke if you do another crowdfund we will all be back for more"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hello Luke :) What are your opinions on games like Rocksmith?"
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Not to nag, but am I seriously ever going to get my kick starter pack? "
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","We didn't do a Kickstarter campaign.  But if you mean IGG - just email us at pthofficial@gmail.com - we realize there are still some of you who didn't get their perks, but also have found a lot of those moved addresses, frigged up their address details, thought they ordered but actually didn't etc.  It will help us if you can verify your purchase and we can go from there.

And genuinely appreciate your contribution and patience."
"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","in Tilting Against Windmills, is Rody's voice echo getting cut on purpose?

"I am Luke Hoskin from Protest the Hero. Ask me Anything!","Hi Luke :) I want to ask you sorry for the people reaction at the concert in Rome, no one have asked the classical ""One more song"", no real energy from the public, I suppose that was a pretty boring concert for you guys (Even if you have played here one month ago ahah) , so i'm going to tell you that the next time the people reaction will be better.

I'm a pianist and I have a couple of things written and I've made sure to leave a lot of ""space"" for other instruments. 

You'd record from home, of course, then I'd get someone to mix the final product. 

Piano 1 is starts technical then goes into a groovy, r&amp;b sounding chorus. The verses are have room to be heavy.

Piano 2 is a bit creepy and has the potential to be the heaviest of the two.


I'm looking for the usual stuff: guitarist, drummer, dirty vocals as well as clean, stylized vocals.

Any takers?

Question: with the prominent piano texture (I'm assuming it'll still be prominent in the final product), will you be recording live piano tracks before it gets mixed? It's be a shame to leave it as midi for something like this."
"Sorry if this is the wrong sub, but I'm looking to collab. I have piano tracks done.","I, unfortunately, don't have a real, acoustic piano.

Technical instrumental music with guest solos from artists generally considered to be firmly within progmetal (Jakub Zytecki, Aaron Marshall, et al.)?

I'm really glad that's what you took from my post, though."
"Albums of 2014 Super Thread","&gt; Technical

The guitar work certainly is but their songwriting just comes off as ""4/4 backing track to shred over."" 
When they write a song as catchy and proggy as CHON then I'll reconsider.


Also implying I can't make note of an album to listen to from your post and *not* mention it in a reply."
"Albums of 2014 Super Thread","I agree with the over-emphasis of shred, not that that's a disqualifier of progmetal, ha! And even that they're not nearly as proggy as CHON, sure, but there's a-plenty of bands that aren't as crazy with their metrical configurations as CHON that are still prog.

In terms of catchiness, though, I think they certainly have that going for them. Forgettable shreddiness aside, most of the songs on the full-length have very catchy choruses."
"Albums of 2014 Super Thread","I agree that James Franco has a very catchy chorus. The music video just screams ""look how cool we are!"" and it irks me the wrong way. I realize that has no impact on how good the song is but maybe if they were humbler I'd give their albums a few more listens."

"[Album Info Request] Modern Noise- Thomas Giles","Listening to this album on All Access and it has been great. I would love to find out more about the personnel involved with album. I don't own the physical album and the album doesn't have a wikipedia page.

Looking just for the general information: Producers, mixer, engineer, and album musicians."

"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","So, I'm in a band called ""Möbius Lung."" I play guitar and write all of the music and my friend plays drums. Unfortunately, that's all we have right now. We're looking for a bassist with no luck and we'd like to eventually have a vocalist. Also, we don't have a lot of money. So, we're having a hard time growing as a band right now. I managed to buy a recording device called the ""H2n"" and that's what we've been using to record our music. We just record it live, so there's a few mistakes here and there in our songs that we've uploaded to YouTube. Currently, we've uploaded a total of 8 songs. Most of them need to be re-recorded and re-uploaded because the quality of each recording isn't consistent. So there's still a lot of work to be done... 

We're very passionate about our music and we won't give up! out of the 8 songs that we have uploaded to YouTube right now, my personal favorite is ""A Dissolving of Veils."" Let me know what you guys think and keep in mind that these are just cheap demos and they will sound much better once we get more money and at least a bassist!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZuJxQoihHs

One more thing to note is that most of the songs on our first album are going to flow right into each other. This song is one of them, so if it seems like the song just kinda ends abruptly, that's why.

===EDIT===

Here's another favorite of mine...

""Diamond of the Unseen""

"
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","If you're interested in recording better quality songs, I'd recommend getting into music production. There's all sorts of software such as amp modeling software that allow you to create quality sounding music on a low or nonexistent budget."
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","Are you talking about a college course? "
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","No, there's loads of information online. Assuming you have decent hardware, everything can be done from your computer."
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","Yeah, I have Audacity and the H2n came with a program called Wavelab. I use both of them to kinda mess around with the equalizer and compressors and that kind of thing. I don't really have advanced experience with that stuff, but I can at least say that the recordings sound a lot better after I use Wavelab to find a good EQ. "
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","Look into DAWs, man. The same people that make Wavelab make a great DAW called Cubase. Audacity and Wavelab are really basic programs for messing around with audio files, but DAWs are amazing from music production. There's definitely a lot to learn, but it's totally worth it if you're passionate about making/recording music."
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","Thanks, man! I will definitely keep that in mind. Is there a specific link you could share with me that will get me started in this journey to become better at recording music? "
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i00E-O0cafA) guy is very informative. He has a series for metal production. I'm what's called a ""bedroom producer"", so besides some midi keyboards an audio interface (Line 6 UX2), I rely heavily on software. Software can get pricey, but there are always ways of acquiring it in different ways."
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","For guitar stuff I'd recommend you get a virtual amp system.  Native Instruments Guitar Rig is one. It emulates all the equipment so you can get a fairly decent sound recording guitar into the computer.  You might even consider an electronic drumkit for the drums to make production easier, but that's up to you."
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","Well, that's where it's getting into a lot of money and we just don't have that right now. Thanks, though, for your input. Right now, our goal is to get some new cymbals and a bassist so we can start playing shows and then I guess we'll see where it goes from there. Once we start making some extra money, we'll start building a home studio, but that's way down the road. "
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","Good luck"
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","Thanks, man."
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","To be honest, virtual amps aren't what I'd call worth it.  Hard to use live unless it's AxeFX II ($2k), and the sound isn't better than a cab.  In many metal scenes, especially prog metal/djent, people have a love affair with amp sims, but they're not always going to be better or worse.  They can be expensive and you can get a Peavey 5150 for less than $700 bucks and you can use them in recordings and live.

In the end, with production, just do what feels and sounds right to you.  Maybe an amp sim is perfect for you."
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","In terms of a DAW, you can get Reaper.  It's ""free"" in that the demo is unlimited in time and content and there are no real restrictions.  An actual license is relatively cheap, too.

I've used Guitar Rig for amp emulation for a while and it gets the job done for a hobbyist like me.  A license for that is relatively pricey, but I think there's a fairly limited free version to try it out.  I also occasionally use Amplitube; it's a similar program that's the same cost.  I find each program is better at different things generally, so I mix it up.

Here's an example of what I've been able to do with all these with fairly limited knowledge: https://soundcloud.com/ryanimation02/torpedo-tuxedo
(plus crappy digital drums from the program Reason)"
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","Nice! It sounds pretty damn good. It definitely sounds a lot crisper than what I've recorded with the H2n. Thanks for the info, man. This is all a good start to my future of recording much higher quality music! "
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","Worth noting you'll also probably need a recording interface for your computer, which is another hurdle money-wise.  I'm probably not the best guy to ask for a recommendation there."
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","Well, it'll take a while before I can start doing stuff like this. I just need to start making some extra money from playing shows and selling merch or something along those lines, but if I can eventually be in a position where I can make my own music and not have to pay someone else to do it, it'll all be worth it. "
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","First off, like Bujjick stated, get reaper.  I use a 400$ daw and I tried reaper after and it literally does the same thing,  the sound quality is based in your interface.  Get a USB interface like a saffire 6 usb.  It's not the most expensive but it will record high quality tracks.  It is my recommendation to only use quick recording modules like the one you have as a reference tool for jam sessions and writing.  Next,go to http://lepouplugins.blogspot.com and download a lecab 2 and look up on YouTube how to use it.  You need impulses for the cab simulation, so you can either find free ones online,  or try out redwirez for higher quality impulses at 10$ each, I use the engl and bogner from them.   Try out any of the free amp sims from lepouplugins.blogspot.com and put them in your fx chain.   This should give you a decently high quality sound after done tweaking.  To get it set up right just go online and there are loads of tutorials.  Sorry for the long post but you can make music on a budget these days and I'm surprised when people still don't know how. So get to work :-) "
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","Well, thanks for the advice. I really appreciate all the suggestions you guys have been giving. I'm pretty surprised myself that I'm still not familiar with all this stuff... I mean I have been very passionate about all of this since I started writing music about 6 years ago, but I've just been lacking that small financial push that I really need. Other than the H2n that I managed to get with my income tax check. I've been thinking about starting up a kickstarter and hopefully getting some donations to help us get this started... I just don't like asking for money, you know? I'd prefer to earn it myself, but it's so hard right now. If I could just get enough to have someone help me record a few demos the right way so that people actually have something of good quality to pay for, I'd do that. Anyways... I'm glad there are people in this subreddit who are willing to give me some advice to get started. I'd love to know what you guys think of the song! Good quality or not,  we are especially proud of this one. :) "
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","I think we gave you advice because it's good enough to hope you get some better recordings and a full line up.  It's not necessarily my cup of tea but it is good in my opinion.  Just needs tightening up."
"My Band - ""Möbius Lung""","Well I agree it needs tightening up and like I said,  everything is in rough draft mode right now.  Once we get a bassist and possibly another guitarist,  we'll be able to bounce more ideas off of each other and change some things here and there. The way it sounds in my head is a lot better because I can imagine what the finished product is going to sound like. We're doing the best we can right now considering it's just guitar and drums. "

"Novallo - Tides (these guys are way too underrated)","I want to like this a lot, but the guitar is edited to death. At this point it's not even robotic sounding, it's just all pick attack. I enjoy clean production as much as the next guy but I've never heard anyone take it this far. Otherwise the composition and everything else is great. "
"Novallo - Tides (these guys are way too underrated)","The new album will be...interesting. The guitarist did a lot of experimenting using his AxFX to create non-guitar sounds. The teasers sound like electronic music. "
"Novallo - Tides (these guys are way too underrated)","That does seem interesting. I don't hate the idea, and I think it could be done really well. I guess the execution is what will determine whether i like it or hate it. The current stuff really reminds me of programmed guitar, like Anup Sastry's material, and given the context it just doesn't sit right with me. I'll definitely give the new album a shot, whenever that comes out. "
"Novallo - Tides (these guys are way too underrated)","Their new single is *less* edited than their first EP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz70wI49ExQ

"Steven Wilson - First Regret / 3 Years Older","so dang proggy"
"Steven Wilson - First Regret / 3 Years Older","I refuse to listen to anything from this before it comes out haha, would be doing Steve an injustice I think because his work just begs to be listened to by the album straight through."
"Steven Wilson - First Regret / 3 Years Older","Getting good now! Where is this from? Is it a full leak?"
"Steven Wilson - First Regret / 3 Years Older","Pretty sure this is official, its the first track from Steven Wilson's newest album: Hand. Cannot. Erase, which comes out in March."
"Steven Wilson - First Regret / 3 Years Older","The vid says it was posted by Nabeen Khadka, so definitely not official. I don't see any official post on either kscope or SW's channels."
"Steven Wilson - First Regret / 3 Years Older","Hmm, according to the description it was taken from Dutch Prog Rock Radio, not sure how they got a hold of it.

I'd certainly agree with your choice for Ashe O'Hara. Altered State is incredibly poetic. Matthieu Romarin from Uneven Structure also makes some really detailed and poetic lyrics. Maynard James Keenan from Tool is brilliant too: Lateralus and Right In Two are great examples.

My absolute favourite would probably be Adrian Fitipaldes. He was just great in Northlane. It was accessible, simple, uplifting and spread a great spiritual message. Singularity lead me to look into DMT and Terence McKenna - which kicked off my own spiritual journey, so I have a lot to be grateful for there.

But he has also written some really silly and weird lyrics, and I can never decide if he's a genius or just insane. And some of his lyrics are in Norwegian, which I don't understand and can't properly judge."
"Who is your favorite lyricist in prog?","If we include artists that are on the fringe of genre's Neil Peart is an amazing lyricist.

"Prog just for being prog?","Not sure this has been discussed before, so feel free to link me if it has.

First, I'm excluding instrumental music from this category because lyrics and vocals are a huge part of what I'm referencing.

In my music library I have made a distinct separation of what I consider two very different styles of ""prog"" rock/metal. I literally label bands as ""prog rock/metal"" or ""progressive rock/metal"".

To me **prog** seems to include or even require most or all of the following elements:

* Keyboards
* Concept albums
* Cheesy/nerdy themes (i.e. Sci-Fi stuff)
* Odd time signatures (sometimes so much so that it's difficult to keep the music fluid)
* Non-melodic/dissonant scales
* Value technicality over emotionality
* High-pitched or off-key vocals

Then **progressive** to me seems to be a lot less formulaic but often incorporates the following:

* Additional instrumentation (i.e. more than just guitar/bass/drums but doesn't often get stuck on one instrument)
* Odd time signatures
* Sticks with melodic scales or balances well melodic+dissonant scales
* Balance of emotion and technicality
* Various genres (quite often I consider just combining my ""progressive"" rock/metal library into one since they are often a mix of both and many other genres (i.e. jazz, blues, classical, etc.)

I tend to prefer ""progressive"" over ""prog"" 80-90% of the time. I prefer emotion most of all in my music. It's the number one most important characteristic. I value technical ability very highly, but not for the sake of just being technical. Too much focus on dissonant/non-melodic scales for the sake of being different often grates my ears and eventually turns me off. Cheesy keyboard effects and Sci-Fi themes disconnects me from the music and leaves me detached.

Examples of **prog** bands that are just too “prog” (i.e. follows the formula outlined above too strictly) for me. Now this doesn’t mean I don’t respect them or listen to them (I often come back and listen to a new album or try them again). But for some reason just the keyboards or vocals are often what push me away, even if the guitars or drums are amazing:

* Rush
* Dream Theater (though I do love Scenes from a Memory, “Pull Me Under” being one of my fav songs by them)
* Genesis
* Yes
* Marillion
* Spock’s Beard
* Savatage
* Symphony X
* Redemption
* Vanden Plas

Examples of **prog** bands that do something right (or include something that I don’t like but am able to filter out or get past):

* Evergrey
* Disperse
* Haken
* Votum
* Mystery
* Riverside
* Division by Zero

Examples of **progressive** bands I love and why (there’s so many so I sadly have to limit this by trying to pick my favorite of each unique characteristic):

* Tool: everything (seriously: song structure, lyrics, vocal style, instrumentation, production, mixing, etc were so unique at that time and still are)
* Opeth: soft/hard dynamics (i.e. vocals &amp; guitars)
* Mastodon: ~~scales~~ melodic dissonance? (these guys are hard to describe for me)
* Wretched: overall instrumentation
* Devin Townsend: production &amp; genres
* Katatonia: mood/emotion
* Between the Buried and Me: genres
* Periphery: nothing super unique but a large blend of slightly unique characteristics
* Tesseract/Skyharbor: vocals &amp; atmosphere
* Karnivool: lyrics &amp; tunings
* Gazpacho: instrumentation &amp; mood
* The Dear Hunter: genres &amp; themes
* The Tea Party: world instruments

Anyway, I just felt like putting this together. I don’t care if anyone reads it, but sometimes I like to organise my thoughts and see what others’ opinions are if they feel like reading my thoughts and responding. Now that you know my tastes feel free to recommend new bands for me or try to introduce me to someone that breaks the boundaries of what I claim I don’t like.

**TL:DR** I split progressive music into two categories: prog and progressive. Prog tends to set a formula and stick with it (i.e. time signatures, themes, keyboards, vocals, etc.) while progressive I consider literally progressive (i.e. artists that literally do something different or unique: general death metal but throw in acoustic guitars, general rock but through in eastern instruments, etc.). I like “progressive” a lot more. What bands do you like/dislike, and what categories do they fall into? What would you recommend to me that you think I would like?"
"Prog just for being prog?","This isn't the first time I've seen someone differentiate between ""prog"" and ""progressive"".  I mean, to me, you can call it whatever you want, but the word prog is really just a shortened version...but the meaning is the same."
"Prog just for being prog?","It makes me think of the difference between ""metal"" and ""heavy metal"" .  To an outsider it's all just heavy metal, because metal is just the shortened term, right?  But to me at least, heavy metal refers to the older stuff like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, while metal refers to the scene as a whole or post-NWBHM.  A similar concept could be the difference between Rock and Rock n' Roll"
"Prog just for being prog?","Not anymore!"
"Prog just for being prog?","I can respect that, even if I can't wrap my head around some of your choices. Though, I don't split it. If it does something different and interesting while being good at it, it's prog (progressive) to me."
"Prog just for being prog?","Yeah, actually I think that's what I was getting at. Part of what I'm trying to say is it seems ""prog"" is a genre. The bands in that category all tend to fit in that category, have a similar style. But ""progressive"" for me is a way to ""classify"" the unclassifiable, the guys that are so unique or diverse they can't be put in a single genre."
"Prog just for being prog?","There's something extremely wrong with throwing Yes and Genesis into a bin of ""generic prog formula"" bands when they literally helped develop the formula by breaking the mold themselves. 

You also lump Marillion into that category while Gazpacho gets a pass for being new and inventive? Gazpacho are fantastic songwriters but they owe all of their tricks to the last 30 years of neoprog. 

It's cool if you want to label bands like this, but let's not pretend it's more than personal taste. Even the rules you listed aren't applied evenly or even to the groups you say they do. Yes valuing technicality over emotion more than Opeth? Have you heard And You And I? Time And A Word? Between The Buried And Me and Devin Townsend fall outside of the group that gets the ""nerdy/cheesey sci-fi"" label? I just don't get it. "
"Prog just for being prog?","All very valid points. This is proving a good exercise for me. I listen to so much music I have to organize it well or I would have an extremely difficult time finding what I want to listen to at any given time. To be honest, you are right about the sci-fi tag. Actually a lot of metal in general falls into that. The more I go through my list the more I think it simply boils down to the damn keyboards. I really hate typical synthesizer keyboard sounds. Many of the bands I listed have that. Another guy mentioned my split also seems to be based on heaviness. That may also be true to some extent. But I still feel there's something else. What could it be? What do you think are the characteristics that split these groups? Or can they even be objectively split? Is it simply the ones I don't like are simply I don't like them for different reasons? "
"Prog just for being prog?","You appear to be a metal fan that happens to listen to some prog, rather than a prog fan that listens to metal or a prog metal fan.

I guess you came from metal first and started listening to prog acts people recommended for you.  It explains why someone suggested heaviness, and also why you hate keyboards (Jordan Rudess has some of the most creative tones, so you probably don't like any keyboards) "
"Prog just for being prog?","Sorry, but Rush? Rush? The single greatest prog rock band of all time? They basically invented hard rocking prog (obviously 21st Century Schizoid Man existed, but everything else is really soft), they have (IMO) the greatest 10+ minute epic ever written (2112), and they succeeded in changing their sound to stay relevant, even moving away from prog for a long time. Plus, they only have one full concept album. "
"Prog just for being prog?","I agree with you but lets not split hairs.  Yes, Clockwork was their only full concept album but 2112 and Hemispheres were concept album SIDES so most people call those concept albums.

Rush is and always has been my favorite band.  I'm 46 years old and I've been into them since the very early 80s.  I love that their sound changes.  My favorite Neil quote is when he said, ""When we realize we're beginning to sound like Rush, we know its time for a change.""
"
"Prog just for being prog?","Ha, that's definitely true. I'm not saying they didn't have high concept stuff, just that technically their only full concept album is CA. I like that Neil quote a lot, I'd never heard that before."
"Prog just for being prog?","I just don't like all these generic metalcore bands these days calling themselves progressive just cause they have some off-time rhythms and a bit of ambience."
"Prog just for being prog?","Agreed, sometimes people get a little to carried away with the ""prog/progressive"" tag. Dude, I drop my high E string to D. I'm progressive."
"Prog just for being prog?","Dude, my bass player listened to a Safety Fire song once. If we're not progressive now, I don't know what is."
"Prog just for being prog?","I'm a little confused at your division of genre, it just seems really arbitrary. If it all helps in your head then thats cool of course, but it just seems like you're grouping the 'heavy' prog bands on one side and the 'not so heavy' prog on another. Just boiling down Mastodon (for example) to scales also strikes me as weird. Those fuckers groove in odd times all over the place, and the scales aren't that weird, they just use a lot of those 'blue' notes or just play weird 'out' notes a bunch, particularly on the old stuff. "
"Prog just for being prog?","It does kind of look like that doesn't it? However, The Dear Hunter, (newer) Karnivool, Gazpacho, The Tea Party, and (some) Devin Townsend are not hard at all.

As for your Mastodon comment, I was trying to characterize each band I listed by the thing that stood out most to me. Mastodon was actually the hardest one for me to describe. Admittedly ""scales"" was not how I wanted to characterize them but I couldn't think of how to describe their most stand-out characteristic in just a few words. Maybe ""melodic dissonance""? Yes, they throw in some ""odd"" notes into the scale or key they're playing and maybe a few ""odd"" harmonics that creates a dissonant sound but still keep a melodic groove and sound to everything. No one really quite does that like they do."
"Prog just for being prog?","I respect your thoughts and opinions but I dunno. I just don't have the same view. Which is fine really. But you did a good job dividing the two terms ""prog"" and ""progressive"""
"Prog just for being prog?","Yeah totally Yes uses dissonant scales and uses odd time signatures exclusively, with plenty of off-key vocals.   BTBAM is always melodic with variation in instrumentation.

Also Tool wasn't crazily unique.  A metal band that got popular at the turn of the century with a loud guitar production style?  What about SOAD?

Also where the heck is King Crimson in that list?  They're probably the most progressive band."
"Prog just for being prog?","I split them as well but not the same way and not as cleanly (i.e. there is a lot of gray area).

I think of bands as being progressive bands, or progressive-x (where x is a genre of music).

If a band is doing what most people today would call progressive (Dream Theater, 70s Rush, Yes, Spock's Beard, Porcupine Tree) then they fit into the former category. 

However, if the band is doing music that is heavily progressive INFLUENCED like Styx, Queensryche, soem Iron Maiden, hell lets even lump Zac Brown Band and Ray Wylie Hubbard in there, then they are ""progressive-x"".

I think a lot of bands are progressive influenced in that they stretch away from their traditional genre.  I'm not into country music in the least but Zac Brown live is flippin' amazing - rock, R&amp;B, soul, motown, country, metal - you hear it all.  That is a prime example of a progressive-x band. (progressive-country in this case)"
"Prog just for being prog?","[deleted]"
"Prog just for being prog?","I see what you're saying, but I'm confused by rush's placement. I'm not some big rush fanatic here to defend the ground they walk on, but aren't they one of the bands that spearheaded prog rock, and contributed the most to it back in the day?

Having a hand in laying the groundwork I can understand why they would sound formulaic nowadays, but I'm pretty sure they were incredibly unique in their time. 

Your list is from a modern perspective though, so it makes sense if I think about it. "
"Prog just for being prog?","To comment on the idea and not on rush, the only mental split I make is bands who

A: benefit from the progress that prog rock/metal has made by applying now mainstreamed but previously uncommon ideas to their music, but still create something unique enough to be considered progressive

B: Heavily contribute to the progressive genre by applying techniques, styles, and ideas that are uncommon, under explored, or nigh unheard of.

Most bands nowadays are a mixture of both, some more of one , and some more of the other. No matter which way you slice it, progressive music is a near impossible to properly define genre, so in the end it all ends up being super subjective. "

**Anathema - [One Last Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs-emvLUY20)**  
*Oh I wish, I wish you could've stayed.*  
I don't think I know of a heavier song (emotionally) than this.  It's about the death of the mother of some members of the band, but the words, because they are so plain and direct, can apply to anyone feeling a similar loss (I'm still afraid to listen to this since my dog died because it's so powerful).  The last lyric (above), though, is just bare grief, and devastating for it.

**Dream Theater - [Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqHSrJ2mLo0)**  
*Her ecstasy means so much to me  
Even deceiving my own blood  
...  
Help! He's my brother, but I love her  
I can't keep away from her touch  
Deception, dishonor*  
Edward generally feels like a straight villain, but these lines allow a little bit of humanization.  For a moment, we see him not as a cold-blooded killer but as a desperately conflicted man.

**Dream Theater - [Only a Matter of Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXD4gonkJIA)**  
*Brave, yet afraid, his eyes on horizon  
in a steady-set gaze  
a mariner soon from an open cocoon  
takes a moment to summon his courage  
to stifle his grave apprehension and  
trembling, approaches the surf  
A father's benediction as his hopeful son departs  
to brave the sea of rage and conquer at all costs  
lingers in his memory  
and visions still surviving in a logic-proof shell  
that should have been held sacred, safe and hidden well  
are compromised in usury  
with every rising sun that yields no sight of land  
the hesitation cultivates within the tired man  
and rumors spread of mutiny  
and though the time will come when dream and day unite  
tonight the only consolation causing him to fight  
is fearless faith in destiny*  
First of all, in a song about a band sticking it out in the face of potential failure, this seafaring metaphor is unusual but expertly handled.  When the band lost Kevin Moore, they lost more than just a keyboard player.  Outside of the vivid imagery, Moore plays with the sounds of the words to great effect.  Alliteration (*sacred, safe*, *consolation causing*, *fight // is fearless faith*) and tight internal rhymes (*mariner soon from an open cocoon*, *unite // tonight*) help to stabilize the unusual rhythmic structure of the passage.  Counting stresses (mostly by iambs), the lines *A father's...* pattern 7-6-4-7-6-4-6-7-4-6-7-4, a very uneven structure; though Dominici doesn't sing it according to that pattern, it still underlies the syllables that he must sing, and the effect remains still.  In fact, Dominici's delivery of these lines is just as imbalanced, dividing his stresses evenly through some lines and in others being rather lopsided (listen to *and visions … hidden well*).

**Gentle Giant - [Think of Me With Kindness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z833vvmbKGM)**

Empty words, I wonder did you know -  
…  
Fare thee well,  
fare thee well,  
you that was once dear to me.  
Think of me with kindness  
Think of me.*  
It's rare to see a breakup handled with such grace.  The first of these two segments stands out to me as a sentiment so rarely ever expressed, and done so well here.  But it's the second that makes me love the song so much.  How better and more bittersweet to part from a beloved than simply to be remembered fondly?

**Riverside - [Forgotten Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU9NZUyiEbI)**

The whole set of lyrics for this song is great.  I love the portrayal of the rise and fall of a great, arrogant civilization, ending in only ruins (reminds me of “Ozymandias”), punctuated by the chilling *Oh listen to them now*.  But the crucial moment of collapse, which I quoted above, is the clear peak.  No memorial, no tale of great defeat.  They died and turned into dust.  No more.  And Mariusz sings it with a frustrated, lamentatious grit that emphasizes the tragedy.  (Side note: I recommend to anyone to play the game Journey and then listen to this song.)"

"What's your favorite lyrical line in prog metal?","I love lyrics that create their own world and atmosphere.

I don't know, imagine you are watching the sun explode: You know you are doomed, but in the face of death you become calm, accepting and appreciative of everything. Best example would be Aeons:

*And I hope you hold a place for us*

*Far enough away*

*From all the flames they like to tell us burn*

*And I hope you hold a way for us*

*But I don't really know you*

Another band that conveys a certain feeling for me in their songs is Porcupine Tree, especialkly the songs that are about Wilsons childhood. I don't really know how to say it, but for me they have this feeling of a summer holiday when you are in elementary school, with only a few things being important, almost everything being perfect, but now that you are grown up and look back at it you can see how twisted and wrong some of the things were. Best example would have to be the classic Trains:

*Train set and match spied under the blind*

*Shiny and contoured the railway winds*

*And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed*

*The hiss of the train at the railway head*

"Anup Sastry - Dreamer (Intervals/Skyharbor drummer)","I still stand by that, but I'm curious why do you disagree? "
"Anup Sastry - Dreamer (Intervals/Skyharbor drummer)","The vocals were flat and uninspired.  I'm not saying they needed screaming per se (though I would prefer that) but they needed someone with actual range.  It was very boring, poorly mixed, and pushed Aaron too far back instead of letting him do his thing.  In Time compared to A Voice Within?   C'mon now...."

"Anup Sastry - Dreamer (Intervals/Skyharbor drummer)","I disagree strongly, I'm a big fan of Mike's vocals. The comment about his range is very valid, but then again i've found it fitting to the songs. It's a forgettable album but it's very enjoyable because of Mike, I've personally felt bored of intervals after listening to In Time and The Space Within after a few listens.

"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","I hear a lot of love for Blackwater Park, but for me this album, alongside Still Life, is their best. "
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","I feel like I hold Blackwater Park in such high regard and above all their other albums simply because that is what got me into metal as a genre and I don't know where I'd be, or what I'd be listening to now if it wasn't for that beautiful record. But in all honesty, I have a really hard time placing those three albums above or below one another. They're all flawless and jaw dropping. "
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","I completely agree. I got into Opeth with Orchid, but pretty much every release, sans Heritage and Pale Communion, has continually managed to instill that sense of why I love Opeth so much. I love Watershed just as much as I love My Arms, Your Hearse, albeit for different reasons. "
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","Agree 100%. But to be fair, we have to acknowledge that just about every Opeth Album is of the highest quality and so I can see why different people have different albums-of-choice. "

"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","Not that I hate it but when Lindgren left they lost so much of that bluesy soulful soloing. Akesson is an amazing guitarrist but I don't think be fits in opeth."
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","But they threw Burden at us and proceeded to blues out like they've never done before. "
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","I can agree with you on that for sure, but solos in general are not really my thing."
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","Actually, Mike plays most of the bluesier stuff, I'm pretty sure. Peter also played those sweeping licks that I always loved, but Mike is definitely one of the most soulful soloers in metal. "
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","Heritage is nice in its own way, but it's too different for me to get behind it (with hints of that different-ness visible in watershed).

Prior to the release of Heritage, i bought tickets to a concert which fell after the release. I was quite disappointed when the concert featured almost exclusively songs off of heritage, with one or two from watershed. Not because the songs were bad, but because they were different from my expectations. I think the only older song was [Face of Melinda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGg155CcGKE) which, though a beautiful song, is basically the song of ""alright, let me catch my breath, and you in the audience can go get a fresh beer"". 

In contrast, the previous Opeth concert i attended was amazing, and i still get a rush when i remember headbanging to the relentless percussive repetition in the last couple 3.5 minutes of [Deliverance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0T-TPXS1M0)."
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","In regards to your last comment, my personal favorite Opeth groove section similar to the end of Deliverance is the one at the end of Harlequin Forest.

"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","Oooh, yes, i like that part too :)

... as well as the whole song."
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","It works for me. I like plenty of music that isn't really metal. And I can appreciate Heritage for the prog rock that it is. 

I didn't like Heritage much at all until I listened to a couple of the songs live. It was way more enjoyable than I anticipated  and really complemented the rest of their set...which had a bunch of their older and more intense material."
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","I like a lot of prog rock as well, but in relation to their other releases, Heritage is their weakest, imo. I prefer Damnation's prog-rock stylings over what they did in Heritage. Perhaps if they took what they learned in Damnation into Heritage I might be a bit more open to the album in general."
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","I like Heritage, but I think Pale Communion is a lot better. PC is easily in my top 5 Opeth albums."
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","Yeah, it is one of the only songs Opeth has made (and the only on Ghost Reveries) which garnered nothing more than a ""meh"" from me. Easily one of their worst songs."
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","One of my top 5 favourite Opeth songs to be honest, this is tied for my favourite Opeth record. It seems like the best middle ground between the old and current Opeth to me."
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","I had heard of opeth my freshman year of college in 2002. Blackwater Park was really interesting, but for whatever reason it didn't really like STICK as a band I would need to check out in my mind. I was just finding out about stuff like dimmu borgir, strapping young lad, soilwork, in flames. All I had exposure to previously was shit like metallica, pantera, megadeth, and slayer.

This whole album is really dynamic. I saw opeth live in 2005 with strapping young lad for sounds of the underground. When this song came on, everything else just clicked. 

I went home, checked out this album and the keyboardist walked through all the best instruments: Vibes, mellotron, organ, fender rhodes piano (it's tube driven so you get a real warm tone). Organ and rhodes together really sealed the deal though.

Then the groove at the end was just lightening to my brain.

Anyway, this song really stood out because of the Guitar and keyboard in the intro. It really sets the tone. When the chorus hits and the growls come out, you have that raw as fuck but damp/muted organ, in the background. I was headbanging with goosebumps the first time i heard it. The calculated precision for which they pick sounds is just so hard to explain in words. You have to pick the songs apart and listen for those little individual nuances, but god damn they add up."
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","Sounds even better with the double bass drum at [6:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kKNT3PdDkE#t=6m18s)"
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","So much yes. It's even better jamming along!"
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","I like the music but the cookie monster vocals ruin it for me.  I do want to like it just not sure how to get into that.  I'm told the two recent releases have a different style though"
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","Yeah, three of their albums have only clean vocals and are all progrock rather than progmetal: Damnation, Heritage, and Pale Communion. The latter two being the most recent; Damnation came out in 2003.  

Heritage sounds the most different of the three. PC is arguably the ""heaviest"" of the three, but not necessarily metal. Personally, I don't like Heritage but I like the other two (Damnation is way better than PC in my opinion as it has more of that Opeth sound; PC sounds like a 70's prog record).  

There are also completely clean songs from their other albums. Some examples include: A Fair Judgement, Porcelain Heart, Burden, Hours of Wealth, etc. However, A Fair Judgement is probably their heaviest song with completely clean vocals. I personally like the duality of the harsh vocals with the cleans, but I know a lot of people are turned off by the death growls. If you are trying to get into the harsh vocals of Opeth, try songs like The Lotus Eater, Harlequin Forest, The Drapery Falls, and Hessian Peel. These songs have more clean than harsh.   

Opeth is a really great band when you really delve into their discography. I hope this helps. "

"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","That intro? This entire album is perfect"
"Opeth - The Grand Conjuration (that intro!)","Yes it does!  Great answer and I will check this out.  I'm a huge Steven Wilson fan also and I know he produced some of their albums.  The later (clean vocals) ones I believe. I don't dislike all roaring vocals, In the past I've loved the music of slayer and coroner and some similar .  I just need a trigger for this band to get me into that . Thanks ! "

"Dominic ""Forest"" Lapointe has left Beyond Creation.","You could join a metal band playing fretless bass having never played an instrument before and still be fellated by the entire metal community."
"Dominic ""Forest"" Lapointe has left Beyond Creation.","I think it's quite the opposite actually. A fretless bassist often become a ""selling"" aspect of the band, which leads said band to bring the bass way up in the mix, which is exactly the case in Beyond Creation. If you are audible, people are going to notice pretty quick if you suck, fretless or not."

"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","I've been abusing all of Opeth's albums for way too long and I need some more stuff that isn't Opeth but has a similar feel. Someone recommended Barren Earth in another thread and I enjoyed it but it just doesn't cut it.  
Basically, I need prog metal with evil riffs, demonic growling and pretty melodies that isn't overproduced or drenched in sythesizers, 8 string guitars and Axe FX like 80% of prog metal bands nowadays.  
So, what have you got?  
EDIT: I don't mind if it has synthesizers, just not way too much."
"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","You'll never find another Opeth friend. They're *the* band."
"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","That's what I was afraid of :(
"
"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","Ne Obliviscaris is the closest I can think of. Imagine Opeth mixed in with some black metal and violin."
"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","I second this. It's hard to find a band like Opeth, but NeO comes pretty close!"
"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","Black Crown Initiate is sort of a more modern, heavy Opeth. "
"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","Oh yeah, I totally forgot about them, that is an awesome band! Have they made any releases after the Song of the Crippled Bull?"
"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","Yes indeed. Their album Wreckage of Stars is amazing."
"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","Just checked that album out, it's definitely got more of a tech death vibe to it but it still scratches my Opeth itch nicely! Great album!"
"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","Cool, I have to check that out!"
"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","No Edge of Sanity? Really?"
"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","I've never realised why Edge of Sanity weren't more popular. Crimson was the song that originally helped me escape the clutches of death metal into proggier pastures."
"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","Early Leprous has an Opeth vibe. [Passing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nim10BdaTMw) or [White](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pY25gvLIFQ) maybe. Not as evil as Opeth can be, but they have a bit of the same melancholy. 

I highly recommend their new albums as well. A bit less Opeth, but definitely top notch prog metal thats not ""8 string Axe fx music""

Some great ones are [Forced Entry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxAIsZldltA), [Restless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=986iAyQpr1U), [Foe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi8NyQvhCUc).

Ihsahn as well - [Unhealer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHdCJKWnvRg)(Even with Mikael on vocals, hah)"
"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","Ovid's Withering is pretty great IMO but as other's have pointed out, Opeth is the pinnacle.  Also, you might want to try Bloodbath with Mikael as well.  They're not as proggy but really dark and heavy."

"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","[Betraus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JLZ6V4--Yg) is the only band I can think of besides Barren Earth who sort of fits your description. Really if Barren Earth doesn't hit the mark I really don't think any other band ever will.

"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","Well they only have one release and it's an EP, and since they're only a small band you might as well just buy it to support them!

Then again I've never really thought much of them, so I haven't bought it myself and I'm not sure how easy it would be to do so, but they have a song to download on their [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Betraeus/app_178091127385?ref=page_internal)"

"I need some more stuff like Opeth!","I get a little opeth vibe from anciients or baroness. Isis is really heavy but light on the prog"

A couple of days ago I've noticed this [one-man-band](http://jamesnorbertivanyi.bandcamp.com/) being recommended by The Helix Nebula on their Facebook page.

So, anyway, I think this music is really close in atmosphere to Opeth of maybe around Watershed time, always keeping you in suspense, sometimes mellow and subtle, sometimes really heavy, all that great stuff.

It's all instrumental though, so beware."

"Jakub Zytecki - Debut Album Teaser #2",""
"Jakub Zytecki - Debut Album Teaser #2","Man, I was realizing the other day that it's been quite a bit it seems like since there was actually any brand new writing from him, which is just making me more and more excited for this solo album. I know there's been a couple new-ish demos up on his soundcloud and the other teaser clip, but most of his demos I've heard were originally from 2010 or 11, and a lot of those were reworked for Disperse rather than a ton of completely new ideas for Living Mirrors.

Anyway, all this to say that I love the snippets I've heard so far of his writing from the past year or 2, his use of pauses and silence is amazing now, all these off-kilter grooves are so alien, yet so tasty.  That video he made a year ago about the strings he uses [has the most ominously grooving first minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9iZljS0QKg) of pretty much anything I can think of."
"Jakub Zytecki - Debut Album Teaser #2","Jakub is a fresh breathe of air in prog metal. I've been waiting for his debut release and finally can see it on the horizon. It feels as if he's going to change the face of prog metal (even if it is in a small way, significant yet). Only other release I'm looking forward to greatly is Tesseract with the reunion of Dan. Anyways, thanks for sharing the video. I can see what you mean about those pauses!"

"Spires - Ethereal Organisms - [14:07]","This is from one of the many overlooked albums of 2014, The Whisperer, by the British band Spires. The sound is somewhere between Ne Obliviscaris and older Opeth and Imagine fans of either will enjoy this a great deal. 

I hope I don't spoil anything when I say it's a really damn good album."

"Bands with savage sounding vocals?","I like bands with wilder more snarly vocals, like more savage/animalistic than average

[Black Dahlia Murder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIKuXnzuYGs) has some good overall vocals.

If you want more of just ""brutal"" type vocal, I would suggest bands like [Creators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4xQvNAF7mM). 


If you want really ""animalistic"" (meaning like primal), I would suggest more deathcore-ish type bands like [Ingested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkw-fGnMuc) or [Waking the Cadaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcBkuLCVSkk)."
"Bands with savage sounding vocals?","Yeah I'm mainly looking for prog/djenty things. Black Dahlia Murder is kind of close to what I'm looking for, I don't really like the rest of it though. Creators sounds good, a little monotone-y though. The last 2 are too pig squealy for me"

I remember his first assessment with me was playing ""Blackbird"" and he performed it better than the original. I thought to myself, what the fuck am I going to teach THIS kid?    Later that year we formed a German metal band and performed a song we ""wrote"" called Der Frosch (or whatever ""the frog"" is in German). We got an International student to scream the title over and over while Sam shredded along with a pretty handy drummer we had, and me trying to keep up on bass. It was hilarious. We killed it on Mulitcultural Day. Good times."

When I was 12 or 13, my dad hooked me up with that older kid, got me some music lessons with him. As it turns out, that guy's dad worked with my dad in the same shop. So he came over a few times and gave me some inspiring lessons, my dad gave him some cash.

"What are your favorite ""epic"" progressive rock/metal tracks.","So, I've been listening to [""Milliontown"" by Frost*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJThffrpY1Q) and [""Learned""](https://arcaneaustralia.bandcamp.com/track/learned) by Arcane lately. Both of them are very lengthy, ambitious, and fleshed-out tracks spanning 20+ minutes. It got me thinking: what are you favorite ""epic songs?"" To lay a set of ground rules, I'd define an ""epic song"" as:

* Having a length of over 15-17 minutes
* Being a continuous piece of music over its entire track length
* It could be divided into separate parts, but it doesn't necessarily need to be.

Now, I'm sure I'm going to see ""Octavarium,"" ""The Odyssey,"" and ""The Great Escape"" posted a lot, but I'm going to go against the grain and choose a Haken song...and not the one most people would think. To date, no lengthy track has enraptured me and made me feel like pausing it would be a disservice to the song like [""Crystallised""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk9Wk96yzBY) has. Every part of it seems deliberate and nothing feels out of place. Not taking anything away from ""Celestial Elixir"" and ""Visions,"" which also fall into the ""epic"" category, I just gravitate more towards ""Crystallised."""

"Bands similar to Mr. Bungle?","Anyone know any bands in the same realm of music as Mr. Bungle? I've been looking, but I can't seem to find any similar bands. Any suggestion is appreciated! Thanks!"
"Bands similar to Mr. Bungle?","What era of Bungle? Each album is significantly different from the last. I would recommend checking out /r/circusmetal and /r/avantgardemetal for similar stuff.

For stuff like the self-titled and California, I recommend Dog Fashion Disco, especially the Adultery album. And their other band, Polkadot Cadaver, especially Purgatory Dance Party. Todd Smith takes a lot of influence from Mike Patton.

It'd also be smart to check out other Mike Patton bands. Faith No More, his solo stuff, and Fantomas. Fantomas may be the closest you'll get to Disco Volante. 

Try Diablo Swing Orchestra. Try a band called Organized Chaos (the singer has appeared in two David Maxim Micic songs). Try Tub Ring. Between the Buried and Me takes a lot of influence from Patton, though it's probably not what you want. 

I'll edit this post later as I think of more bands, though I would definitely check the top submissions from those two subreddits at the top."
"Bands similar to Mr. Bungle?","Thanks! I like all three of their albums equally

EDIT: Dog Fashion Disco sounds like just what I was looking for!"
"Bands similar to Mr. Bungle?","It kind of depends on what you like about Bungle and what you get out of them.  If you are just following Mike Patton (which is ok!) for more craziness go with Fantomas.  For more poppy (if it can be called that!) go with Faith No More.

Someone like Devin Townsend might work for you."
"Bands similar to Mr. Bungle?","Check out Cardiacs. "
"Bands similar to Mr. Bungle?","Check out [Schizoid Lloyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8cyHKs82RM), very eclectic band that is somewhat similar to Mr. Bungle, here's a review by [heavyblogisheavy with a 4.5/5 score](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2015/01/13/schizoid-lloyd-the-last-note-in-gods-magnum-opus/)"
"Bands similar to Mr. Bungle?","Yes!!!! This is great, thanks"
"Bands similar to Mr. Bungle?","I highly recommend Secret Chiefs 3. It's a band (or group of bands) that Trey Spruance (guitars from Mr. Bungle) leads. Very weird, awesome, experimental stuff.

You might also like Giant Squid, uneXpect, Sleepy Time Gorilla Museum, and Buckethead."
"Bands similar to Mr. Bungle?","As someone else mentioned, Secret Chiefs 3 is amazing. The more I listen to them, the more I actually prefer it to Bungle. I'd recommend the album Book of Horizons to start.

Estradasphere is another revered genre-hopping band that took a huge influence from Bungle. [Here's a sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c0AFEWjczY) Palace of Mirrors is a good starting point for them, though Buck Fever is their most Bungle-sounding."
"Bands similar to Mr. Bungle?","Fantomas"

"Bands similar to Mr. Bungle?","Akphaezya is pretty great.  Not quite as out there, but the singer reminds me of a female  Mike Patton. "

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1_5ul4Nr_A"
"Bands similar to Mr. Bungle?","Twelve Foot Ninja."
"Bands similar to Mr. Bungle?","[Unexpect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QdXoGrKPFk) make extremely experimental metal with circus influences. Their songwriting is all over the place. They have a female lead singer, the two guitarists are secondary lead singers, the bassist uses 9 strings and they have lots of more instrumentation to make everything weirder... and better

[Hunab Ku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6DJTD3RG54&amp;safe=active) just check this out... great experimental band with a Mr Bungle/Dillinger/Meshuggah vibe to it. their 2010 EP ""The Rewiring Process"" is a 10 minute masterpiece

check out [Heavy Blog is Heavy's Avant-Garde Week](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/tag/avant-garde-metal-week/)  for all kinds of experimental metal, some of which sound kinda like bungle"
"One Hundred Thousand - Low (really under appreciated band)",""
"One Hundred Thousand - Low (really under appreciated band)","How under appreciated? really under appreciated. Also really altrock.

That being said, just so my comment isn't completely pointless and snarky, I do like the guitar tone, thick and warm. The texture under the outro of the bridge [around 3:00 is nice, too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4nYUIoYjA4#t=183), the piano and muted guitar unison are pleasant."
"One Hundred Thousand - Low (really under appreciated band)","Hahah cool 150-300 views with studio quality music as well as studio playthroughs isn't under recognized at all. I'm glad you approve though, this sub can now flourish."
"One Hundred Thousand - Low (really under appreciated band)","Sorry, wasn't debating the lack of recognition, just think that you could put more informative words in the title than 'under appreciated'. Maybe a 'FFO: [Band Name, Band Name, Adjective]'. Glad you returned my snark though, I probably deserve it."
"One Hundred Thousand - Low (really under appreciated band)","Who gives a shit about how he labels the song, go back to listening to Periphery and just shut your mouth.

*insert nitpicky subjective opinion here, follow up with backhanded compliment alluding to musical knowledge afterword*

Definitely has an Alt-Rock vibe, the whole thing about Progressive Music is that it normally employs aspects of different genres. ;)"
"One Hundred Thousand - Low (really under appreciated band)","Are you objecting ('follow up with backhanded compliment alluding to musical knowledge') that I used them gosh darn plumb fancy music terms when, you know, trying to discuss music? Want me to tone down mah fancy book lernin'? How should I go about offering my opinion.

And yes, prog music combines aspects of different genres, but this song doesn't have a lot going on, it really does come across to me as a more straightforward alternative rock song. Not really employing aspects of different genres. Maybe they have wildly contrasting songs in their catalogue that are the epitome of prog, but then in that case those other songs should be posted, not this one."
"One Hundred Thousand - Low (really under appreciated band)","I checked out the rest of the EP, it's pretty solid. Kind of surprising they have so few views. The vocalist matches their style and tone very well.

It has been out from November, it is critically acclaimed, heralded by BTBAM fans and dissidents alike; yet, I don't feel like it is getting recognized by the herd.

"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","What the fuck? It's listed under two separate artists called Periphery, and the album covers are slightly different... "
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","Yeah, I saw that too. I was aware of the other Periphery but Spotify decided to add Juggenaut under them as well..."
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","Both albums are marked as 2014 as well. 

Not that big of a deal. It will get worked out eventually. "
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","I have bought both albums. I'm curious what people here think about them.


To me they have a very noticeably different sound than their older stuff.


Sure some songs have that old feel to them, but a lot of them like heavy heart are very different.
Thoughts?"
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","Heavy Heart sounds like pop metal, the chorus line is very catchy. "
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","Four songs in and really don't think I'll be listening to this at all.  Just sounds too much like emo pop Rock (I think its the vocals. Haven't had an issue in the past but these are a whole new level). Maybe my musical tastes have changed in the past few years but it sounds like a poor man's version of sky harbor with a touch of DT thrown in.  "
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","If you liked P2 and haven't listened to Omega yet, I highly recommend it. Reprise and Priestess are still pretty different, but the rest of Omega feels much more familiar and heavy."
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","Ya I'll give omega a spin but I couldn't even make it through alpha.  Probably go back and listen to omega tomorrow."
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","You gave up on alpha too early in the album. Trust."
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","Made it 45 seconds into scourge and just had to tap out at that point. If an album is absolutely horrendous 5 songs in, I'm not going to give the rest of it the benefit of the doubt."
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","That's funny, because about two minutes later the album really digs in and displays some of its heavier P2'ish stuff.

Do what you do, but remember that you're not really giving the full thing a chance."
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","That's true and it looks like most people generally like the album which is nice.  I love the experimental nature of prog but it might just be a swing and miss for me which happens."
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","I understand the dislike for the first half of Alpha, but the second half makes up for it in my opinion. Hell, even the second half of The Scourge is awesome. You obviously don't have to listen to it, but I'd urge you to try and power through the rest."
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","Seriously, I love the scourge. Its the song that sends you into the best stuff the album has to offer. The breakdown and building tension get me so pumped, and then all hell breaks loose and it just feels like GOOD periphery again!

I'm loving it."
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","I felt the same way you did when I first listened to the albums last week; besides a couple songs, I didn't like it at all. But the more I listen to them, the more I like them. There are a lot of melodies and musical themes that are reoccurring throughout both albums, and the more I listen to it the more I appreciate the way its all pieced together. At first I was disappointed that it wasn't musically ""Periphery 3"", but now I'm glad that its not."
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","The instruments are great.  But I've finally found myself in the anti-spencer vocals group even though I enjoyed his vocals previously. I have yet to listen to omega but I just don't see getting over the vocals on alpha.  "
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","Dope. I have a long commute to and from work every day. I have a hard time listening to full records at home, I get distracted easily. "
"For anyone interested, Juggernaut just went up on US Spotify.","Very interested in this information, thanks OP.  Now I can go back to not using Itunes again.  "

"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world",""
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","Something I noticed that really stuck out to me is his comments on the ""formula"" of pop music nowadays.

I've been noticing this when my wife plays the radio (she listens to pop sometimes), is how fucking similar the chord progressions, tempo, and keys are when you listen to the Hot 100 on any given day. A lot of the intervals of the notes sung for pop choruses resemble each other.

It feels like I'm being psychologically raped by whoever is marketing this philosophy of ~~writing~~ *selling* music."
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlNgYDotMoE) is an example of six pop-country songs played at once.  "
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","Holy shit that's crazy! Also the singer in red (cole something) sounds just like Zeke from Bob's Burgers."
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","the crazy thing is that it's still fucking catchy, even at the end when all are playing at once.

Edit: I'd also love to hear a 5 min guitar solo thrown together from all hit country rock songs of the last 8 years."
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","It's really interesting to consider the ""progression"" of cookie-cutter pop music, too. If you look back, say, 2 years, you'd find a bunch of pop songs that were 3.5-4 minutes of pop music (like basically just singing), but now it's 3-3.5 minutes were 1.5 mins of it *might* be singing and the rest of the interludes are drops. Not even interesting drops. Just a bunch of like 4:4 clap-friendly pieces.  It's boring. 

I'm a big fan of John Legend and Justin Timberlake because they actually sing and write interesting songs. 

I also think it's interesting to see how that even indie/singer-songwriter genres have become the exact same formula for the songs. Most genres have become pretty stagnant. Unfortunately. "
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","Nowhere near prog metal, but Bo Burnham has songs about Bieber-type pop and pop country, both of which are hilarious. On mobile, cannot link, youtube, etc."
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","[Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt9c0UeYhFc)"

"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","Axis of Awesome - 4 Chords https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ

49 chart topper songs using the same chords"
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","Agreed. While they sell music, they simultaneously ""buy"" attention. With enough money, those songs are everywhere - radio, YouTube, television, movies, etc. Pop music is designed to be catchy to the point of infectious, and placing it on so many outlets spreads it. Like a plague!"
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","There's a sort of lemming effect in the hot 100 stuff where when one song makes it big, tons of other songs come out that are more like variations of the previous song than actual new music. That's probably where a lot of that ""similar intervals"" stuff comes from. As far as keys, tempos, and chord progressions go, I think most pop artists just sort of pick standard ones and go from there. It's not necessarily a bad approach if you can build something unique on top of a standard base, the main problem is that most pop artists don't. "
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","Devin is a cool dude. It's rare to see such a genuine person in the music industry these days."
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","Every time I read a devy interview it just sounds like he loves making music but hates everything surrounding that. Seems like it causes him a lot of stress.

That's the impression I get, anyway. "
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","I think a lot of musicians echo that sentiment. They enjoy writing, recording, and playing, but all the other parts must really wear on them. "
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","A close friend of mine's brother has been trying to break into the country music scene for years. For some time him and his sister sang together till she just couldn't take it any longer, and he went off on his own. But they way he put out his first record was all ""business"" from what she told me. She told me he had researched everything, and they needed a sad/slow song, a funny song, a pro-america song, a love song, then the rest could be whatever. It was very much a formula. And now, he looks and sounds like every other country artist out there. He is talented, but he's putting his talent and voice in that box to sell a product."
"Interesting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world","I thought this was extremely interesting, and it certainly seems true. As an outsider, I thought I was stereotyping country music in that it seemed like there were a few song archetypes I heard constantly (i.e., a fun song about trucks and beer; a slow, sad song about an ex).  "

I hope others feel the same, because it feels amazing. "
"CHON - Story","When I first heard CHON, it was one of those things where I got down on my own abilities a little and had those creeping ""you should just give up now"" thoughts in the back of my mind.

Awesome dudes, too. Chilled and mingled after their set when they opened for AAL."

"CHON - Story","This song is very warm and angular and twinkley. I love it so much. Just great composition and musicianship here. 

I hope others here frequent the math rock subreddit as well as there are so many genre crossovers. I think next to prog metal, math rock is my next most listened to genre. Good recommendation! "
"CHON - Story","This song maybe, but i wouldn't say all their stuff is. Elliptical Illuminations is straight up prog metal. A lot of their stuff though yeah is either math rock or on the fence between the two."
"CHON - Story","The ending was gorgeous. So psychedelic."
"CHON - Story","These guys need to play at festivals. They would mesmerize the people on acid and shrooms."

"CHON - Story","This album is gonna be amazing."
"CHON - Story","Huge fan, interestingly I think this is the first time I've heard them play with more than just an amp haha."
"CHON - Story","Just a heads up guys, Sumerian is censoring any comments of any negative connotation. Chon themselves took the ability for me to comment on their posts, which according to them was because I said ""see you suck fucks at the show""? I went to see them live but was skeptical when Woohoo first released because it was identical sounding to NS. Because of this they said I was threatening them.  I've bought every release they've put out so far, and they are some straight up divas now. 

Regardless, that doesn't justify Sumerian deleting the comment that got 20 upvotes regarding Chon as a One Trick, formulatic pony. A few other posts have been deleted, I wish I had print-screened cause I joked with my lady friend as I posted my two cents that it would likely get deleted too. Sure enough. 

People's voices are being censored and it's kinda sad to be honest. "
"CHON - Story","I remember replying to your comment on youtube and I don't see it there, but my comment that is a bit critical is still there, and some other negative comments are there.

I agree their songs all sound so similar and it's because all of them are based on a maj7 chord structure. "
"CHON - Story","Im gonna have to stick my two cents and be brutally honest, this is boring as hell. Couldnt keep my interest at all. Theyre definitely talented musicians but i just dont know what it is about them, theyve always been missing a certain factor for me, it all sounds the same too."
"CHON - Story","I agree. I used to really like CHONs demos and much older material, but their last two releases bore me to death. Its bland and a little formulaic sounding. Theyre basing their whole writing style completely around maj7 arpeggios and little flurries of tapping lines interspersed throughout. I want them to go back to things like Mountains of Creation"
"CHON - Story","Yeah, Mountains of Creation has always stood out as one of my favorites. The thing I've started to notice about all of my favorite artists is that, once they become full-time, professional musicians, after their first releases, their work loses a bit of the passion and particularity of when they were doing it 100% for fun.

That being said, it's all still great, well made stuff, and I'm completely interested in what these guys will do in the future."
"CHON - Story","I dont think they've lost the passion, they've just matured a lot and their musical tastes changed. When they wrote their demo stuff they were still in their early teens. They've mentioned in interviews that before Woohoo they really started to enjoy Tigran Hamasyan and became rather heavily influenced by him in their new music. "
"CHON - Story","I think you misunderstand me. I don't doubt that they love making the music just as much as before, rather that they don't have the time to devote themselves as wholly to the writing process, as counter-intuitive as that sounds. Touring, recording, pr, and all of the other aspects that come along with their increased recognition and professional status seem to make it harder for any artist to follow through with their process as completely and freely as they did at first. It's just a slight loss of freedom, and rise in expectation. But, like I said, it doesn't mean I think any less of their current material. It's not a decline in quality, rather an increase in pressure on their personal artistry/intricacies.

I notice this in a range of musicians from Thelonious Monk, to Omar Rodriguez Lopez, to Kanye West. 

"
"CHON - Story","I agre, personally I get the impression that their song-writing itself just isn't all there yet. If you look at 
Newborn Sun, it felt kind of all over the place. The songs felt more like ""hey we are gonna jam for 3 minutes and call it a song"" rather than actually having some sort of framework."
"CHON - Story","I've gotta agree...I usually love match rock / whatever post kind of stuff you want to relate them too...but theres something about Chon that never fully stuck for me. I like it well enough - but I never get the urge to seek them out or put any of their music on unless I stumble across it. 

The newer the songs get the less interesting they are getting as well. Maybe in time it'll click for me =\"
"CHON - Story","Meh all their stuff starts to sound the same after a while."
"CHON - Story","I personally like ""reliable"" bands."
"CHON - Story","[deleted]"
"CHON - Story","I've listened through Newborn Sun maybe 10 times, what I like is that their style didn't change too much. This is their style and it is original. I think this new album is gonna be good. "
"CHON - Story","Yo, what's up with that snare?  It's total weaksauce."
"CHON - Story","Yeah, it could have a bit more snap, but I feel like their drum sounds have always been pretty underwhelming. Can we talk about the feel change Nathan kills at 3:10?"
"CHON - Story","such a cool change of feel right there, put quite the smile on my face"

"Portnoy, Sheehan, MacAlpine, Sherinian - Acid Rain- Live In Tokyo","Yeah, it was Portnoy, Petrucci, Levin, and Rudess (prior to him joining DT with the departure of Sherinian). I was actually one of the original members on Portnoy's forum back when it opened in the FII days.  I had a front-row seat watching the guy make one bad decision after another - from the entire Myung lyrics debate, the ""What would you say, if I walked up away?"" fan-slamming lyric fiasco, to the DT breakup, to the bullshit tweet pic of ""all of his riches"", to the Avenge Sevenfold fiasco, and more.  I'm glad the Winery Dogs things is working out for him.  I stopped following his projects a few years ago.  He's a talented drummer, he just takes shit way to personally and he's WAY to controlling.  "
"Portnoy, Sheehan, MacAlpine, Sherinian - Acid Rain- Live In Tokyo","Could you summarize these fiascos? I didn't realize there was a debate around John Myung's (lack of?) lyrics, I didn't see the tweet pic of his riches, and I have no idea what happened between Portnoy and Avenged Sevenfold. "
"Portnoy, Sheehan, MacAlpine, Sherinian - Acid Rain- Live In Tokyo","It wasn't between Portnoy and AX7. When the Rev died and Portnoy chose to fill in for the balance of the AX7 tour DT was on a break. AX7 ends and Portnoy has been touring but the rest of the band is rested and ready to go back to work. Portnoy demands a break/puts his foot down/whatever, and the band moves on. DT gets new drummer. "
"Portnoy, Sheehan, MacAlpine, Sherinian - Acid Rain- Live In Tokyo","Sure... It's been a crazy trip.  First of all, Myung wrote a bunch of lyrics in DT's early days.  Most fans consider these to be the best of the band's history (Learning to Live was likely his pinnacle piece).  Mike then places a moratorium on John's lyrics because he felt he needed to micro-manage them in order to fit the band's playing style, despite the outcry from fans that asked for WAY more Myung lyrics.  ""What Would you say"" lyrics come from the song ""Never Enough"", which was written about a particular MP.com user who complained about Mike posting a link to a sound clip from his extensive personal archive.  I don't know what happened to Mike that day, but he took it so personally he wrote a song about it.  The thing is, there was always a core group of people who complained about everything.  99% of us blew them off and they typically faded into the woodwork.. but when Mike writes a song about it, he offended his direct fan base.  We knew he wasn't talking about everyone, but still... is it necessary to draw attention to the minute percentage of haters??  No.   After the break up with DT, there was certainly a bunch of Portnoy hate cast upon the internet.  Mike's response?  Post a picture of him standing in from of his house with all of his cars and riches talking about how his problems were better than the common man.  It wasn't a terrible thing to do, but in the context with how things were going and the timing of it, a PR disaster. The Avenge story was after he was touring with them, he was ready to head into the studio and the guys from the band were like ""Uuuh, no... it was just a tour thing"".  The A7 guys repeatedly said they told him it was strictly a tour thing, but apparently he thought he worked himself into a permanent spot.  Awkward pony.  Perhaps it wasn't made clear, but it was yet another thing on the trail of tears.  It was just one awkward situation and bad choice after another... I, admittedly was checked out after the ""What would you say"" fiasco.  I'm doing a poor job of conveying how poorly these situations were handled in the Portnoy camp, but trust me, it drove a HUGE divide in long-time communities and inside the fan base.  It was the strangest, most bizarre band issue I've ever witnessed first hand.  "

Elaborate? He's been constantly playing with different people since he left DT..."
"Portnoy, Sheehan, MacAlpine, Sherinian - Acid Rain- Live In Tokyo","It goes all the way back to DT.  He had is hand wrapped around everything.  Not letting any of the other band members grow, never bringing in an outside Producer, involved with every aspect of the video stuff he did including the editing, and post-production.  He did it all.  Some people argued that DT was his ""brand"" and that he was a ""hard worker"", but this was exposed when the guys from A7 started feeling it - which was reported (...is admittedly speculation) why they parted ways after the tour.  And also why he has a hard time putting together a ""full time"" primary band.  Maybe the Winery Dogs can be that for him. "

"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","It's satisfying to see that people with this opinion are becoming more outspoken. It felt for a while that I was one of very few who actually abhorred the latest album.     "
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","It didn't take long for people to get out of it. Illumination Theory had clouded a lot of opinions on the album, but every time people praised it, they used this as their go-to and when the praise for that faded, so did it for the album. I like Illumination Theory too, though the out-of-place and overly long middle makes that a hard opinion to have for me, but the rest of the album felt pretty weak."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","I agree. I like the 6-7 first minutes of Illumination Theory, but kind of have problems after that. 

The album has some good moments (Behind The Veil is something I would listen on repeat for a while)."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","I love the middle section of Illumination Theory! I just don't particularly like the rest of the song! The Bigger Picture is the one song on there that I would think twice before skipping on shuffle, the rest is pretty mediocre stuff"
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","I tried a few times to listen to it but it is very underwhelming to me and the songs seem very proud of themselves with nothing really new to offer.  I really liked ADTOE and I was not expecting to like it at all.  

The best part of Illumination Theory to me is that part of it sort of sounds like FF7-battle music.  Other than that, it sounds over-processed and I feel like I've heard it all before.

I've never liked his approach to be fair."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","Scenes From a Memory is around the time he had the food poisoning incident that damaged his vocal cords, so that's probably about right. It wasn't until the past five years or so that Labrie said his voice feels like his voice fully recovered."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","I think he had that incident between the recording of Awake and A Change of Seasons. For some reason the vocals on A Change of Season, Falling into Infinity and SFaM don't bother me near as much as the albums after that. I think it also has to do with the fact that the lyrics in most DT songs are just terrible."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","I gotta say, imo, every now and then Dream Theater makes some pretty nifty lyrics. Most aren't that great, but the ones that are I really like."

Heh. I get it."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","I'm not crazy about post- portnoy dream theater. A dramatic turn of events was a really good album, but the sound was already starting to sound... over processed to me a little bit. The new album did not impress me at all. Their sound isn't good anymore, the songwriting wasn't that great, and it sounds like mangini triggered every piece of equipment on his set. 

I'm really trying not to just be butthurt about portnoy. I know he's not coming back, but I genuinely don't think mangini is right for the band. I really think I would have liked them more if they picked up marco minneman. 

Anyway, I'll give this album a shot, but I fear it will drive me down to someone who's just casually aware of them. Flying Colors is starting to take their place as my favorite prog band (not to mention symphony x and porcupine tree)."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","I feel like part of the reason I couldn't enjoy the self titled as much as I wanted to was due to the mix and production quality. Everything was too damn loud. The drums were triggered to fuck and there were no dynamics to be found on the album (Speaking as if you looked at the wave form of the album). Same with Breaking the Fourth Wall, Mangini's drums were so obviously/badly triggered, other than that, it is a fantastic performance. Unfortunately, it's not the kind of thing I can just listen to, I need to watch it, otherwise the drums just overpower everything and ruin it.

It makes me sad not to enjoy something of theirs as much as maybe I should, because I love DT, and musically speaking, the last album was pretty good (not great, but good). I hope they go back to a more organic and cleaner mix "
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","I find it difficult to make the switch from portnoys very raw and very natural sound to manginis... sound. I just don't like little decisions he makes either. Like when they played the shattered fortress (which I don't think they should do without portnoy, but that's neither here nor there) they got to the heavy part right after the first chorus. Portnoy played that with his hi hat riding open, which fit the part. Mangini played with his tightly shut. That little thing ruined a very cool part of the song for me. Well, that, and johns tone sounding like someone poured mud in his amp. "
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","That was the first thing I thought when I heard that. He totally killed the groove at that part. I could even tolerate Petrucci's tone on Breaking the Fourth Wall but so many parts were just ruined or changed by Mangini."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","Which is funny, because didn't they decide against marco minneman because they didn't like that he changed things? "
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","I was pretty sure they hired Mangini so that he could play the parts exactly like they were meant to be played. I think it's fair to give him some freedom on his own albums, Dramatic and DT, but I don't think he should interpret the other albums that he didn't participate on. "
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","Especially a song like the shattered fortress, seeing as it was portnoys song. I don't really think they should play that anymore as it is, let alone change it."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","Marco stated in an interview that he originally didn't want the job and that Dream Theater always had Mangini in mind from the get go. While Marco could have gotten the job, that would mean he would have had to put Dream Theater first no matter what and Marco didn't want that. So while Marco would have been great, I prefer him with Steven Wilson, The Aristocrats and Joe Satriani. Mangini doesn't get much of a say apparently in song writing, so maybe if he got to write some songs some good could come from it."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","&gt; Flying Colors is starting to take their place as my favorite prog band (not to mention symphony x and porcupine tree).

Judging by the bands you like, you should check out the Flower Kings and Transatlantic (although I'm guessing you're aware of the latter already)."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","Transatlantic is great."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","Yea, Flying Colors is pretty great. Neal Morse still knows how to write great tunes."

Breaking the Fourth Wall is incredible"
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","Don't get me wrong, I love him as a drummer, but it just doesn't click for me. "
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","On one hand, Minneman would have been quite perfect for DT.

On the other, I'm *very* glad they didn't pick him, so he could be part of Steven Wilson's band. The Raven That Refused To Sing wouldn't have been the same without him."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","I'm so excited for the new album. The studio updates sound so great."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","I feel like they should have taken Portnoy seriously when he said they should take a break for a few years and then get back together with something better than ever.
"
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","That clearly was the right thing to do. The process of writing in studio once a year worked for a few albums, but their writing started to become repetitive and indulgent. It's truly like they're a caricature of what they used to be. Each album since Train of Thought has been significantly worse than the previous, and there was really only so much I could tolerate.

The change in their creative process has even extended so far as to massively influence the style with which the members approach their instrument. Rudess only has one solo tone and style. Myung seems like all he plays is what petrucci wrote. Petrucci now has chops that are only suitable to composed music - he can no longer improvise.  Some of his best solos, live, and even on albums, were improvised. Voices, most of LTE.  At this point he has abandoned his original blues/david Gilmour influence, and his is vibrato is gone. "
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","Octivarium is arguably one of their best though."
"Dream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.","Songs? Maybe. Albums? Absolutely not. Every album before it is significantly better. "

It really put some  and Carnatic music (Southern Indian melody) tinge to the progressive rock/metal they were playing.

"Anyone have drum sheet music for Degenerate by Monuments?","I want to understand the complex patterns in the song but I can't comprehend them by just listening to them. Anyone have the sheet music that they wouldn't mind giving me? Thanks."
"Anyone have drum sheet music for Degenerate by Monuments?","Start getting the bass drum pattern(guitar riff basically) down with your hands with your left foot going on the hi hat pedal if you can. 
Get the tempo and feeling of the polymeters and then move the pattern down to your feet. Most of these types of songs are relatively easy to play once you know the pattern and feel comfortable with it.  

Alex Rudinger just did a cover of it which can help a lot in getting patterns. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVGXQ6oxuL8"

"COG - Problem Reaction Solution","I love COG as a band, but I am NOT a fan of the lyrical content of this song. I get that they were very much a punk band at heart, and I respect the right to sing about whatever they like, but the lyrics sour an otherwise catchy song in my eyes."
"COG - Problem Reaction Solution","I love how subjective music is and how personal it cane be, for me the lyrics are amazing. the whole sharing space lyrical content blew me away."
"COG - Problem Reaction Solution","I'm all for subjective lyrics and personal interpretation, but it's hard to think of any additional meanings for a song that pretty clearly advocates anti-US conspiracy theories and seems to insist that they're all true."

"My rough guitar tab of Anatomy Anomalies by The Contortionist","Hey guys! I've been trying to figure out how to play my favorite Contortionist song, Anatomy Anomalies, by ear as well as by watching live videos of them to see what they are playing. Some parts are extremely hard to figure out, but I've got some really cool parts of the song tabbed out. This is the first tab I've ever made so I'm sorry for formatting errors! Let's try to figure out the rest of the song!

"My rough guitar tab of Anatomy Anomalies by The Contortionist","I'll try as soon as someone uploads a live video of Robby/Cam!

"Toehider - The Thing With Me",""
"Toehider - The Thing With Me","I really dig this album.  I appreciate this song, but I find myself skipping it most of the time.  It's just so over the top it's kinda draining."
"Toehider - The Thing With Me","That's why I LOOOOOOVE it. I think this album draws a noticeable influence (mostly this song and ""Whatever Makes You Feel Superior"") from 80's rock/metal, including some of the ridiculousness of it. This song is just a lot of fun to me, and so enjoyable to jam to.

That's why I love the album as a whole, it excels in diversity for sure. You and I Both Lose (But Five Wins) is a very progressive-sounding song, and then it immediately switches to that 80's almost Boston-like sound with the next track. And then you get to What Kind of Creature Am I? And it sounds kind of like Protest the Hero, honestly. That variety gives it strength."
"Toehider - The Thing With Me","I agree with all that.  And I do actually like this song, just in moderation."
"Toehider - The Thing With Me","I'm the exact same way. I actually love this song, but I don't ever want to hear it if I'm listening to the full alubm. "

"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Limb From Limb-Fortress

This song starts off with an intro guaranteed to get you pumped, and just never stops. Catchy and memorable, and my favorite protest the hero song."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","http://youtu.be/Y0hbnrxxh5A
Fear and Loathing in Laramie

A very early PtH song from their A Calculated Use of Sound EP, it showcases the hardcore and punk influences they came from.  Between the socially conscious lyrics they have recently returned to and the proto-prog instrumentation, this song showcases both the band's early sound and the promise of what was to come."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Mist- Volition

I feel as though the song sums up what PTH is in essence. From its punk rock influences to the marching melodies that get stuck in your head. The song has a lot of heart and that's what the band is all about. (At least that's what I've always felt.)"
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","[deleted]"
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","C'est la vie - Scurrilous

C'est la vie doesn't fuck around, and is the perfect opener for Scurrilous. The whole song is classic Peachy H, with Rody Walker delivering his one of his most impressive vocal performances yet. Definitely a good listen for anyone first getting into Protest."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","This is the song that got me into them. Maybe because it felt less on the core-y end of things and more on the traditional prog metal side. "
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","I feel like every song is going to be posted in here because they have such a distinct sound that works for every song. There's only a small few that I wouldn't expect to make a potential top 10 list."

"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","**Drumhead Trial** - Volition

Starts off fast and sucks you right in with some really cool fast riffing. The lyrics on this one are so epic and the guitar riffs complement them really well. The back and forth guitar solos are insane and certainly very memorable. The guest vocals done by Kayla are very well executed and fit in wonderfully with Rody's voice. Finally, BRING ON THE STORM, BRING ON THE RAIN, BRING ON THE JESTERS AND BRING ON THE PAIN! Need I say more? "
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Preeeeetty sure it's Jesters instead of Justice if I remember the lyrics correctly but either way that part kicks ass! "
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Oh, you are correct sir, thank you!"
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Her guest vocals on this song (and the others on Volition) are absolutely perfect."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","The female vocals on this song are done by Kayla Howran, not Jadea. I'm pretty sure this is the only song she sings on, but seriously killer part."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","You're right. I've looked her up before, she's a country singer apparently. I was hoping she'd be in a more indie rock type band which I think I'd quite enjoy. "
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","**Dunsel** - Scurrilous

Protest the Hero's musical expression of their journey in the music industry and their discovery of its greedy grasp on creative freedom. Heartfelt lyrics with beautiful instrumentation. "
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","**The Dissentience** - Fortress

Though it could be argued that such praise is par for the course regarding PTH, The Dissentience is a prime example of their incredible riff and melody work, and is a stand-out for it's evocative lyrics. The last verse with the little break before Rody's final scream is chill-inducing.
"
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Hair Trigger - Scurrilous

This is a very personal PTH song, that has been their most essential driving quality throughout the years. Serious riffs and you know when you first figured out the meaning you read the lyrics 10 times. This song finishes with the most uncomparable mind numbing guest vocals from Jadea Kelly that has to be noted as their best with lyrics like, ""frozen, dripping, holiday bird."""
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Dunsel - Scurrilous

While not as flashy as a lot of their songs, Dunsel is an important part of PTH's discography. The song feels a lot more controlled than their previous work, showing how the band has matured during their time as a band. Lyrically the sing is rather straightforward, but lays out some of their feelings towards the music industry, feelings which would later lead them to move to crowd funding for their next album. "
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","I agree with this one, obviously."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","I love this one! "
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","**Bury the Hatchet** - Kezia

Rody evokes the rawest emotion of the whole album during this song (IMO), speaking from the perspective of the prison guard. His interleaving screams perfectly punctuate the guard's violent outbursts, backed by some of the heaviest guitar work on the album. This song stands out from many others on the album which, despite telling their part of a coherent narrative, tend to sound a bit ""samey"", stylistically speaking."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","**The Divine Suicide of K.** - Kezia

This is the last song in the section of Kezia that tells the story from our hero whom the album is named after. Next to *Turn Soonest to the Sea*, this song has the best lyrics on the album, and some of the best by Protest the Hero amongst their entire works. The song ties up everyone's perspectives together, referring to them all directly as well as a reference to *Blindfolds Aside*. The song ends in yet another fantastic vocal contribution by Jadea Kelly, wrapping up everything beautifully tragically. *The Divine Suicide of K.* best humanizes Kezia, allowing the listener to connect with her one more time before her execution. 

Seriously, why has no one made this album a movie or musical? It's begging to be made!"
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","I don't think you can call her a hero, more of a victim. 

Great song though!"
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Skies - Volition

This song is all over the place, constantly introducing new riffs and sections, as well as different singers throughout. If there was ever to be a song to really capture Luke and Tim's skill, this is it."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Not to mention the story telling. Everytime I hear this song I can just picture the scene in my head. All coming full circle by reminding you that all you need is your friends and those close to you, and you can overcome any adversity.
This one has my vote."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","A Plateful Of Our Dead - Kezia

This song is a perfect and innovative end to a concept album, having the band finish a story with their own perspective. The lyrics, riffs, and punkish melodies are impecable and really make you think with some large metaphors. It also ends with a beautiful instrumental piece. "
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","The ""if I believed in meat"" line prompted me to look up and find out that they're all vegetarians. Pretty awesome."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","**Skies**—Volition

This and Tool's Lateralus are my two favorite metal songs ever written. It features a phenomenal blend of style, from a clean intro displaying Rody's gorgeous vocal skill to an absurdly technical riff showcasing Tim and Luke's precision to a couple of ultra-mathy and proggy bridges, and wraps it all up with one of the most satisfying conclusions in all of music. The long low E that fades out at the end of the song wraps up the album perfectly. Overall, one of the most diverse, brilliant songs, which represents both their varying styles and their brilliantly cohesive overall songwriting."

"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","**Underbite** - Volition

Like ""Dunsel"" from the previous album, this song addresses the band's grievances with the music industry, but instead of denouncing the corporate big-wigs, this one attacks the artists who are just trying to make money and don't actually care about their music or fans. PtH are known for caring a great deal about both, so it makes sense that Rody has so many powerful things to say on the subject. Not to mention the music is top-notch."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","**Heretics and Killers** - Kezia

This is the first demonstration of what PTH was capable of when they started out. Fast, melodic up and down riffs, tight rhythmic backing with power chords and octaves, and slithering call-and-response arpeggios at the end between Luke and Tim that are pristine. Moe's odd-time signature changes, mixed with punk-influenced snare hits, guide you through the changing paces and sudden stop-starts that PTH utilize throughout Kezia and onward. Arif's bass slaps and pops at the beginning grabs your ear and reminds you that you cannot simply count him as 'another' bassist. Lastly, Rody's highs and lows are on point adding just the right amount of raw emotion and tenacity. The lyrics being belted out are complemented well by growling and a street-gang like yelling from the backup vocals. This song set the stage for Kezia and sets a very high standard for the rest of the bands discography, which does not disappoint. 

Edit: Shit, not 2-3 sentences. It stays."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Bone Marrow - Fortress

There's quite a lot to talk about with Bone Marrow. Rody's vocals are on point, the way he alternates between raspy screams and very full melodic vocals is really pleasing to listen to, and this song is the best example of how he can blend the two into the same section so seamlessly. The song goes from this real driving rhythm, to a slow dirge, to a mid-paced stomp, and finally to an instrumental piano section, and yet it works, and is a good example of Protest's style of through-composition, which is the main component of their music that has helped them stand out from everyone else."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Tandem - Scurrilous

This one is terribly well written. It's about cancer and how we deal with it inside and out. Standing by someone who is fighting and fighting with them. The last verse of the song is just beautiful. "
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","[deleted]"
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","[deleted]"
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Blindfolds Aside - Kezia

This song brilliantly wraps up the soldier's POV section of the album. It exhibits both the frantic feeling/pace that pervades much of the album along with the emotion inherent in the lyrics, and blends them well. It is a great showcase for the band's instrumental and lyrical talents, especially at such a young age. 

"
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Kezia was such a good album, but unfortunately I don't think a lot of people have realized this. I hope this track gets support it's my favorite off the album."

"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame"," **She Who Mars the Skin of Gods** - Kezia

Every part is own amazing piece all working together. It keeps you engaged the entire time, and wraps up with a great appearance from Jadea Kelly."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","[deleted]"
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Clarity - Volition

While some PTH fans probably dislike the song because of its more accessible sound, it's personally one of my favorites. Phenomenal songwriting and a really neat opening riff. Plenty of my friends that want to get into PTH or prog metal in general have asked me who to check out, and this song has topped the list every time."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Turn Soonest to the Sea - Kezia

This song has some of the same riffage going on in the rest of the album, but one thing makes it stand over the rest: the ending. When ""MAYBE SOMEDAY"" kicks in, the song reaching a whole new level of mind-shatteringly awesome. It's just a beautiful, powerful end to a phenomenal song.

EDIT: Also, as /u/AsylumPlagueRat mentioned, the lyrics for this song are amazing. It's a feminist anthem of sorts, and it's totally badass. 

&gt;I'll know our city is in ruins when our greatest source of pride 

&gt;is a monument of dicks and ribs and the gender crown we wore

"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","This song has my vote, but this song has some of the best musicianship this band had to offer. And the lyrics and vocals are so awesome."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Yeah, absolutely, the whole song is killer. The end stands out to me, though.

Forgot to mention the lyrics though, they're a big boon to this one."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","I'm gonna make a strange comparison, but when everyone starts singing ""Maybe someday..."" it reminded me of Les Miserables when they sing Do You Hear the People Sing. I think it's the most powerful moment on the entire album."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","That or the gnarly break from Divinity Within!"
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","**Bloodmeat** - Fortress

As one of their most popular - if not *the* most popular song, Bloodmeat instantly draws you in with the iconic intro rhythm that sets the tone for the rest of the song. In its relatively short timespan of just under 4 minutes, it covers a lot of ground and rarely repeats itself, making it a welcome listen after hundreds of plays."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","DA DA DADA DA DA DA DADADAooooooooohhhhhh"
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","This is the only song ever that gives me tingles every time I listen to it no matter how many times I listen to it."
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Sex Tapes - Scurrilous

This song has some of the coolest riffage from all four of their albums. It epitomizes the great tapping riffs paired with rhythm that Luke has been pulling off! It has strong blues references, and is an overall amazing song.

(Or we could just put all of Fortress on it)"
"Protest the Hero wins Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Sequoia Throne - Fortress

Technically one of the most difficult songs to play, but nothing feels like it was put in for the sole purpose of being flashy. The lyrics are fairly thought-provoking and intelligent, Rody absolutely kills the vocals. This song most sums up what PTH do and do well."

"I'm a freelance drummer who recently successfully crowdfunded my debut solo EP. The first single is free!","Great intro! The rest didn't impress me to much. Maybe because I'm not a fan of that modern guitar sound. Turns me off and I think it's overused in todays progmetal. But what I think is great is that you're a composing drummer. That's how you put the ""progress"" in Progressive Metal. It's about learning and trying and experimenting. And I always appreciat ""Solo""-projects. When there is one person having a master-plan and going through with it. Cheers. "
"I'm a freelance drummer who recently successfully crowdfunded my debut solo EP. The first single is free!","Fair enough. Not being a guitarist myself, its not about the guitar tone for me, but the composition, which is what I spent most of my time on. I left the production to the pros."

"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","I was making a joke. Usually if you post BTBAM it'll get like 50+ upvotes and people will be like ""these guys are good."" We need to make them hall of fame."

"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Telos into Bloom into Melting City is such a great transition in terms of story and musical style, and BTBAM do it seamlessly . God I love this band. "
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Parallax &gt; Black Box &gt; Telos &gt; Bloom &gt; Melting City "
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Well yeah, good point. Pretty much the whole fucking album. 

The 'Arabic' riff in extremophile elite at 8.02 needs more love. "
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Glad someone else enjoys that exact riff.
I listen to that specific riff while high and man do I zone out."
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","I just noticed your username, props. I really have to get stoned to btbam, I've listened to catch 33 in its entirety and that was almost like a spiritual experience, but btbam will feel more like she's journey I think. 

Parallax, the great misdirect and colors are on my list. 
Have you listened to language by the contortionist? "
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Love your name, as well! Protest are top 5 for me. 

Man, you HAVE to get stoned to BTBAM. It's so time consuming (which is perfect for days off or boredom), but wonderfully so. Journey is a great word for it. 
As for The Contortionist, Language is definitely a great stoner album. Honestly, any of their albums are great stoned. (I smoke/listen to albums a lot.) Not sure why it (Language) is getting mixed reviews. I absolutely love it."
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Will definitely do it, thanks dude. I love them enough to have a tattoo of Colors and a small night owl. Looking to turn that into one big BTBAM/space themed sleeve. 

You know, I've always disregarded The Contortionist as a 'core' band with too much going on out of sheer ignorance. I even decided to skip seeing them when they supported Protest in Dec 2014. But I listened to Language last week after seeing it on this sub a lot, and I'm honestly blown away by it. I hear Cynic, BTBAM, Tesseract, Tetrafusion in this album, but it's very mature and holds it's own. 

EDIT: Also meant to correct myself about Extremophile Elite, it's more of an Indian riff? very similar sitar sounds"
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","*Oriental* is a better word for that riff."
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Ehhh, I dunno. I think I do hear sitar-like sounds in there. "
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Nice, man! I have Colors on my ribs. Always thought the owl was cool, just not for me.

I think some more time with their previous two albums, and you'll come to love TC as a whole, haha. "

"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","That needs ""more love""? Everyone recognized it as the standout riff of Extremophile because it brings back the part from Spectral Reflection."
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","This is news to me, which part exactly in Spectral Reflection?"
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","At that part he says ""walking into a certain state of"" in that 5/4 pattern. Same as 8:56 in spectral reflection"
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","The pattern and vocals are the same but the riff is not. "
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","No of course not but its clearly a callback"
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","pretty sure it's Telos&gt;Bloom&gt;Melting City"

"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","dude, holy shit. thank you"
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","I really wish Blake's was from the studio. He plays it differently live and it's like watching a bad lip syncing."
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Best song on Parallax 2 IMO. This is really the big climax of the story IMO. "
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Somewhat, for me it's obviously Silent Flight Parliament. But I find Telos the most 'antagonistic' and ominous/malevolent song on the album which really gives you an idea as to what the Night Owls are. "
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","When this album first came out, I remember reading an interview in which Paul said that Telos is the meat and potatoes of the album."
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Interesting, in what way do you think he meant? In terms of story?

I think of Bloom and Astral Body being the more 'fun' songs with a bit less lyrical relevance to the storyline, fillers such as Black Box/Goodbye to everything to help build up to 'meaty' songs such as Extremophile Elite, Lay your Ghosts to Rest, Melting City, Telos. And finally Silent Flight Parliament as the one big epic on the album to close everything off. Its nice that it finishes with Reprise as the album comes full circle. "
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Apparently Bloom finishes the story from Swim to the Moon when the protagonist goes out to sea to die and gets pulled under.  They realize his special purpose and let him go.

Edit: Not Sun of Nothing, Swim to the Moon"
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Not sure if you were talking about me, but Telos is the part of the story where Prospect 2(I think it's 2, could be wrong) decides to destroy the human race and ignore Prospect 1. Telos literally means ""the end"". And it has parts from the point of view of Prospect 2's wife who he left behind without any explanation, and she leaves him a note in case he comes back and then kills herself. 

I feel like the entire story as a whole, starts to conclude from this song and everything after. Of course there are out of context parts like Bloom, but still. "
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","My Greek is a little rusty but doesn't it mean end? But yeah I think you're right!"
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Yeah you are right. The song is about the decision to destroy the human race, and Telos means the end.(of the human race)"
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","my google fu says that it's simply as you said, Telos means 'end'"
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Lay Your Ghosts To Rest for me. The part where its made to sound like its through a crappy speaker gets me every time."
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","love that part "
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","I was at the show when they played this live for the first time ever, it was nuts. It was the first off-date show they had leading in to Summer Slaughter 2012 with Job for a Cowboy and Periphery at Pop's in St. Louis. Setlist was:

White Walls  
Specular Reflection  
The Decade of Statues  
Telos  
Sun of Nothing  
Fossil Genera - A Feed from Cloud Mountain  
Disease, Injury, Madness  

Sorry for rambling, just made me remember that fucking badass show haha"
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","I saw them play with Job and The Ocean in Nashville when they were touring for Parallax I and it was such a kickass show! Job absolutely killed it too. "
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Never been a huge fan of Job, although I hear Sun Eater is a beast of an album. But I'd fucking kill to see The Ocean. They've never come here :("
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","Their energy was otherworldly. Sun Eater is an awesome album, you should definitely give it a spin... it's a pretty radical departure from their old sound. But in the best way possible. "
"Between the Buried and Me - Telos","That's what I hear and why Im interested. I was never a fan of their prior deathcore/techdeath sound but reviews kind of said that they really grew into a more full-bodied sound, almost progressive in a sense. Which sounds really cool. Don't know what to expect but its on my spotify!"

"vod - itji (all-bass post-metal sludge band)","Gotcha! Well I will say I like Vod a lot better than ELE, and am excited to hear the rest of the album. Is it just me or is the quality lower/track quieter for the song than the teaser?"
"vod - itji (all-bass post-metal sludge band)","Yeah that's possible. We went for a more natural production. No compression, everything's fine-tuned with EQs and such. That makes the sound a bit quieter, but there's a lot more dynamic range, and the quality of the sound is higher too. Just raise the volume a few notches more than usual and you'll get the same volume out! [Here's another example of quiet metal music](http://warpprism.bandcamp.com/)"

"
"Isis - So Did We","It's not dead by any means, but it's only got 10.6% as many subs as progmetal, and that ratio seems off to me. Then again, the heyday of post-metal is past us... RIP 2004-2006."
"Isis - So Did We","'Post-metal' never really had a heyday as it was based on albums like Spirit of Eden at the end of the 80's and then GY!BE toyed around with their influence before all these other outifts decided to run with it."
"Isis - So Did We","Yeah. It sucks to realize that Panopticon is almost 11, and ISIS has been disbanded for five years. I guess I can count myself among the lucky few who got to seem them *a lot* over the years, as well as twice on the farewell tour.

"[NEWS] We may not have seen the last of Opeth's death metal elements!","I'd rather have Åkerfeldt make the music he wants to make rather than force out another death metal album just because his fans insist he does. That never results in good music.

It has *everything* to do with it. Say what you will about Pale Communion and Heritage but they were both passionate albums and I really like them. They might not be your cup of tea but trust me, if Opeth decided to do another death metal album just for the sake of making money but not because they actually wanted to, that album would totally suck."

"False Awakening Suite - Dream Theater",""
"False Awakening Suite - Dream Theater","Much as I dig this track... why did they feel necessary to make it a suite? 

What is added to this track by dividing it into three parts? It's less than three minutes long, and there's no dynamic, noticeable difference between them. 

Does anyone why they chose to do this?"
"False Awakening Suite - Dream Theater","There is a dramatic pause between each section, which probably implies that they were at least trying to make it three separate parts. 

I think it was probably just a problem with the composition. I've tried to write songs with drastically different parts, and every fucking time, the two ""different"" parts end up sounding similar. If they're at all like me, they originally intended for the three parts to sound more different, but somewhere during the songwriting process they ended up putting too much effort into making it flow together for the three parts to really sound distinct."
"False Awakening Suite - Dream Theater","Okay, I see where you're coming from, but at the point when all is said and done, why still keep it as three parts? 

My theory is that they have a bunch of song title ideas lined up and wanted to burn off a few more than usual so they used all the sleep disorder ones on one song. "
"False Awakening Suite - Dream Theater","In the end, you usually stick to the original concept. They had this idea of a suite, so they tried to make a suite, but it ended up as a coherent instrumental. I bet they still hear it as a suite. They hear the differences in the melodies, the subtle changes in instrumentation, and to them these changes are much bigger than they are to us. 

I bet the original idea was to make a concept song about different sleep disorders. I bet they had this concept in mind even when this album was recorded. Sometimes, it's only in retrospect that you realize things like how similar different parts sound."
"False Awakening Suite - Dream Theater","Thanks, I see more of the process behind it now. 

I honestly wasn't expecting such a legitimate answer. Cheers. "
"False Awakening Suite - Dream Theater","[As far as I know, they mainly wrote it as an opening track for their live shows.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xFtIY8Qs8A) That's the best explanation I can give."
"False Awakening Suite - Dream Theater","Does anyone know if Mangini played the percussion on this song? It sounds like they recorded with real instruments, so it'd make sense if there was an orchestral percussionist along with the strings. But, I also bet that Mangini could play those parts himself if he really wanted to, being a former music professor and whatnot. "
"False Awakening Suite - Dream Theater","He did play them yeah

http://youtu.be/RWMjLeez49I?t=1m14s "
"False Awakening Suite - Dream Theater","In that case, I'm really impressed. That song has textbook percussion, quite top notch. Maybe not at the level of the greatest orchestral percussionists, but good enough to trick a fool like me! "
"False Awakening Suite - Dream Theater","They wrote it to become something quick that they could play over the PA right before their set. It's works in that capacity, but not in much of anything else."
"False Awakening Suite - Dream Theater","garbage. their only good song is Enemy Inside"

"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","Sorry in advance for the wall of text, but I spent a lot of time listening and thinking about the new Juggernaut albums from Periphery and below is in my opinion the story the album tells.  I hope you all like it and am inviting feedback on parts you may think I’m dead wrong about or may be on the right track about.   I obviously can’t know if any of what I’ve come up with is right or not.  

TLDR: The overarching story of the albums tells a story of a man who is born into a cult, involved in some kind of experimentation or even perhaps satanic rituals.  He is having second thoughts about everything he’s been involved in and tries to come to terms with it and grow past it, but in the end can’t do it.  In an attempt to free himself from the guilt and redeem himself, he kills those that he was controlled by.  Not finding relief, and possibly captured, he  loses his faith. After taking his own life, he serves his sentence in hell and is reborn.  There are many references to political conspiracy events in the real world which leads me to believe that the album draws a lot of influence from the stories and events of real people who may have been involved in such events.  

I’ll try to explain the story line song by song below.


* 1.	A Black Minute – The title itself seems to be a reference to multiple books by the same name, that all tell the story of murders that start small and as more information is revealed, more -crimes become involved and evidence uncovered.  More and more political figures, police and others get involved before ultimately a massive cover up takes place by those with the power and those who are guilty.   This sets the background of our narrator, a child who is born into some kind of religious cult.  The lyrics paint a picture of what seems to be a ritual taking place, with the word “sacrifice” being used.
* 2.	MK Ultra – [Literally the code name of a CIA operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra)  involving mind control that went horribly wrong, involved unknown deaths and injuries of children and adults as well.  MK Ultra is unquestionably told as the “sacrifice”, or ritual, is taking place, with a much harsher tone and tells the story of the abuse they give to the children.  Direct quotes such as “Innocent babe, shall we corrupt at such a young age” and “take this bruise as a sign that we own you now and forevermore” are fairly clear in my mind.  The elevator type music that comes toward the end of the song, signifies that the experience is all but routine for the members of the evil group, part of their life as normal as anything else, and also that the ritual is done.
* 3.	Heavy Heart – This song is a reflection by the narrator on what his life has become.  He feels bad but is trying to just let it go, “What's left with me is a memory, when the flesh moves on” showing that his mind is having trouble getting past it.  Wishing he could just go away and disappear from it all, “sometimes I wish I had wings, fly far away from this life”.  His horrible actions consume his everyday life, “these thoughts go on all day, and it takes hold of me”.  He finally finds rest (sleep), ashamed of what he’s a part of and whats happened to him, it even haunts him even in sleep.  “Resting now, their bodies hit the ground, nightmares creep over me I hear the sounds”.  
* 4.	The Event – I believe this song is the narrator dreaming, re-experiencing the atrocities he has been forced to be a part of.   
* 5.	The Scourge – The narrator awakes from the nightmare “eyes heavy, omens clear”.  He is distraught and wanting to give up, “This man, he fell apart,”  but as you’ll notice halfway through the song it begins to get a little more cheery as he decides that he needs to get it together as “I will survive.”  He also seems to point anger at those he has been involved with and may have coerced/forced him to be a part of things he regrets, “the blood that it spills shall start my serenade, to you”.  Perhaps looking to get revenge.  The end of the song also samples part of psychosphere, an allusion to what he may be planning.  
* 6.	Alpha – This song seems to the narrator coming to realize some of society’s problems with never being content.  The narrator may have been victim of this very problem, always wanting what he can’t have and willing to do questionable things to be able to reach higher places which is how he’s ended up in this situation he’s in.  “Wanting what you’ll never have and it’s a goddamn broken state of mind,” he seems to be coming to the realization that the root of most problems come from envy and never being content with what we have.  “It’s envy been eating away at the core of us, wanting what you’ll never have,”.  
* 7.	22 Faces – Another song that gets its title from a real life story of a girl named Jenny Hill who is an alleged survivor of a modern day human sacrifice ceremony.  22 faces is the name of the book about her, which is a reference to the 22 multiple personalities that she has from the trauma.  The lyrics of the song express the narrator is trying to live his life day to day and just get by while he is plotting revenge.  Life has turned into a mundane process for him as he keeps his head down and trudges through.  “Have I lost track of time? Yeah!.....Staring at the hourglass, my life, it feels like a machine, running with no direction.”
* 8.	Rainbow Gravity – Getting its name from a fairly recent and controversial theory of the universe that goes against the big bang theory, Rainbow Gravity continues the dialogue of Alpha but takes it to the extreme.  As the scientific theory states, the universe does not have a single starting or ending point, but goes back and goes forward infinitely, this song talks about the future of humanity and where it is we may be going.  “Will we fall forever alone, down in this unknown abyss” – maybe a reference to the theory.  
* 9.	Four Lights – This song is a reference to a fictional mind control experiment taking place in Star Trek The Next Generation season 6 episode 11 “Chain of command,  Part II”.  In the episode, Captain Jean-Luc Picard is tortured and attempted to be ‘programmed’  into saying there are 5 lights lit when there are actually 4 (very similar to 1984’s 2+2=5 scene). Another instrumental, setting up the scene that is about to take place.  
* 10.	Psychosphere – meaning all realms of consciousness.  Pyschosphere is the climax of the album leading up to what I believe is the scene where he kills those responsible for what happened to him.  He’s separated from his old self and is seemingly a new person and has become the bringer of destruction.  “I am a product of a mind that was never mine and now it says kill them slow”.  He knows that once he does this act he can never go back, “This is a one way road, kill them slow”.  He views this act as one that may finally free him from the guilt and burden that he’s been carrying ever since, what I suppose would be, his involvement in some kind of cult.  “Stop fucking pulling, would you release the grip and let go?! (in reference to the memories and guilt), I’ve got a life to live and a life to end,” 

 
**Omega**


* 1.	Reprise – literally meaning a repeated passage of music, this song mimics the black minute from alpha.  
* 2.	The Bad Thing – Still upset with everything that’s happened to him up to this point the narrator doesn’t know where to direct his anger, “I wish that I could throw everyone and everything,” and is just generally pissed at everything.  “I’d like a reason just to help them bleed, give me a reason come on give it to me,” he has a lot of pent up anger and doesn’t seem to care who he takes it out on.  
* 3.	Priestess-The narrator feels imprisoned still even though he’s in a sense let go of his old life.  Maybe he even is literally imprisoned by other members of the cult,  maybe he only killed his parents or a few of the members.  In this prison he lets the darkness seep into his mind and begins considering taking his own life.   I don’t think he feels as redeemed as he hoped, and is still carrying the full weight as before.  A religious song by name, and in my opinion, makes reference to one of the most religious places in the world in the chorus.  “Nevermind what is underneath the stone, this life we live alone,” The stone he’s referencing I believe is the “foundation stone” which rests in the Jerusalem which has ties to multiple biblical events in Christianity, Judaism and Islam.  Legend has it that buried under the stone was the Ark of the Covenant.  The narrator is saying that we don’t need to worry about the different religions or religion at all, and need to worry about ourselves.   For this story to make sense the narrator would have to have been religious to some extent whether by choice or forced into it since the cult like situation he was in.  Giving up his faith in this song he takes a drastic step moving forward.
* 4.	Graveless -  In graveless the narrator takes his own life, having given up on ever getting his second chance at life, he can’t escape the horrors he has been a part of and having lost his faith (in priestess) sees no other option.  
* 5.	Hell Below – Fairly straight forward you can probably guess what this song is about.  After taking his life he’s now descending into hell.  “The demons drag me down, clawing for the heavens, they pull,”
* 6.	Omega – The title track of the second album, and “end” in the sense of alpha and omega, this is the end of the line for the narrator...or so he thinks.  He continues his journey into the underworld and sees himself for what he became, a demon.   Reliving his atrocities he begins begging for pity.  “I’ve learned from past experience I am a monster…” “Take pity on a soul and grant me resurrection, grant forgiveness” He wishes he didn’t take his own life, “Regret is ripping the throat from my neck,” because now he is stuck in hell, “Now I can’t speak, I wander, here in death, I weep.”  With the final lines he offers the same advice as before, “stop bleeding on the inside, we are alive, and it’s more than enough to paint the walls that are white,” saying that we need to be happy with what we have and that being alive is enough to give us enjoyment and satisfaction.  
* 7.	Stranger Things – In a twist ending, the album continues!  The narrator continues his new life in hell, “below the hadean seal.”  An unknown amount of time has passed, but his sentence has been served “Fallen angel, you speak my name,” He’s being called upon, “The needle turns, the hourglass is spinning around,” signifying that time is up, “Give it, I want it… a sense of a fucking life,” He believes he’s going to be released.  “Take a breath for seconds in this moment,” he’s taking a deep breath, almost in disbelief of what’s happening, “exhale your death and feel life, like water raining from above,” he has gotten his life back.  “The tortured realm has released my name, I can feel my body parting with this world. Rebirth is starting from within, I’m born some place beyond your time,” he’s been released and is reborn into the world once again.  Perhaps he is born again at another such cult ritual that he was originally born as the end of stranger things is the same as the intro to a black minute, you could say that he's repeating the cycle.

"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","Great post OP, this is cool!  I've been waiting for someone to decode this album, as I'm terrible with interpretations.  You even went the extra mile and backed up your ideas with actual real life events.  Some of which I might actually research at my own leisure.  Rainbow Gravity and 22 faces for sure.  

Speaking of Rainbow Gravity, with Jake's obsession with space and such, I'm willing to bet he was the one who named the song that.  Just a thought.  "
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","[deleted]"
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","Thanks ! I bounced a lot of the ideas off my friend who turned me onto periphery /u/coffeescentedurine and he suggested I actually write it out ! Glad I did. "
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","I hope /u/iambulb sees this post! This was a wonderful interpretation, and really helps to appreciate the album beyond just the instruments and vocals. Great job! "
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","I've actually been looking at it as if the main character had some demon/entity infused with their own mind.

This would explain why sometimes the lyrics talk about ""us"" rather than ""me"". ""22 faces"" and ""Psychosphere"" also suggest to me this theme of multiple personalities (now even more so, with OPs references). 

This would make ""Four Lights"" about the main character resisting the influence of this other entity, by acknowledging only the existing four lights (as per the Star Trek episode). And the line  “Stop fucking pulling, would you release the grip and let go?!"" in ""Psychosphere"" would be this entity fighting for dominance.

I've also been assuming that either the main character is actually a woman, or there is one in the story, maybe even one secondary character that also shares a consciousness with the main one.

In Alpha, Spencer sings ""The bastard in *our* brain will chew until it bleeds"", which suggests a struggle shared by two or more identities against this evil influence that also inhabits the main characters mind.

 I can't quite place it right now, but somewhere in the lyrics there is actually a mention to ""her"".

In ""A Black Minute"" the line ""Embrace the feeling of our human skin
intertwining now in ecstasy"" seems to allude to the conception of a child during - and for the purposes of - this ritual, or the fusing of two lives through the ritual. Suggesting then, the presence of a man and a woman.

Reprise also suggests the presence of a male and a female to me, with the lines ""A sacrifice in this duality"" and ""Our blessings given as the children moan"".

Also, the OPs interpretation of ""Rainbow Gravity"" seems to be supported by the video for ""Alpha"", wherein a character plays a game called Rainbow Gravity to somewhat reverse some tragic events in his life, by bending time and space. So the song ""Rainbow Gravity"" seems to be about the main character considering the ability to turn their whole life around.

Although I am sure there are broader themes in every song (i.e. change for humanity, as opposed to change for the main character).

One of such events seems to be him running over someone after deciding to drive drunk. I have come to strongly relate this to ""Heavy Heart"", where Spencer sings ""As the water beads upon the window, turn the sad song up on the radio"". But this might be a stretch on my end.

EDIT: Had to change a word because proof reading three times was not enough to get it all right. Also, no **tl;dr** because this is actually the shorts I could make it."
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","Yes, I definitely think it's a duality thing, where the main character is half possessed but still has free will."
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","This is how I see it as well. The line in A Black Minute, ""A birthing right in this duality, moon and sun"" suggests this, as well as the corresponding line in Reprise, ""A sacrifice in this duality."" And the more literal line in Graveless ""I feel Beelzebub inside me, he's been here all along.""

There are also a couple songs/parts of songs I see as mainly being told from the perspective of the ""demon."" The verse in Psychosphere is a good example ""Stop fucking pulling, will you release the grip and let go? I've got a life to life and a lot to end."" Another example, though more subjective, is the chorus of The Bad Thing: ""Isn't this desire that you're looking for, or is insanity just knocking on your door? Give me just a piece and surely you will find everything is better on the other side."" I see this as the demon beckoning the protagonist to relinquish control and give in to his dark temptations. Just my interpretation."
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","That was my interpretation as well. I also think at the end of the story during stranger things, that when the main character is going through rebirth or being freed from possession I thought about these lines:

""Sounds of ambient voices lead me from nowhere, the skeletal mask brings a demon of the day"" 

I felt like maybe the was the story cycling and the newborn baby being sacrificed/possessed by a demon and maybe the demon was him or something with a twist like that."
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","Whoa, I actually had this same thought! That would go along with the theme of ""embracing the soul within"" and what not. Cool theory."
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","I agree with the repeating, getting reborn part.  If you watch the alpha video and with the whole rainbow gravity theory, it makes since.  I also believe that the character gets possessed by a demon at some point, which takes him to hell."
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","Fantastic summary.  I'm glad other people are into thinking critically about this stuff! "
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","This is a great post!  I'm of the older generation, so Periphery isn't a band I have ever paid much attention to in this genre.  After reading this I have listened and paid attention a little more.  

It seems like this may be this generations Operation Mindcrime.  We'll see if it stands the test of time, but I love that our music is still moving forward!"
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","That is nearly exactly what I got out of it but you went into way more detail than I did. I also got some sort of theme in The Bad Thing of the main character/demon seeing through dimensions or transcending boundaries almost as if he is able to see earth and hell at the same time.

I kind of got that from:

""Sometimes there's a crack in the world that I can peer through, to see it for what it really is""

and 

""There's an ugly face staring back, demons are everywhere.""
"
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","Late to the party here, but what do you make of Scarlet and it's pretty solid connection to the album?"

"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","Great job! Really loving the focus on the intertextuality. "

I'd say this is the closest we'll get before the band's actual statement. Though there are several things which are not essential to the story that I think you got wrong (like A Black Minute) but the MK Ultra outro interpretation is awesome!"
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","The video for alpha pretty much backs you up"
"My interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story","During the VIP Q&amp;A session in Seattle the band confirmed that the music video has nothing to do with the story. The director of the video came up with everything for it, separate from the writing process for Juggernaut. "

"Ever Forthright - Lost In Our Escape","Something closer to what we were hoping for from the new Periphery :/"
"Ever Forthright - Lost In Our Escape","Funny, I always thought Periphery should also go in this direction, but maybe a bit less intense as Ever Forthright"
"Ever Forthright - Lost In Our Escape","You can totally hear this type of stuff in the old misha and haunted shores tracks. I think in trying to make the songs more digestible, they lost the wow factor that made periphery so standout in the first place."

I found them from this [hilarious Unholy Confessions cover with subtitles](http://youtu.be/ZtMuzFA-URA) on their channel. They had a link to their music and I thought it would be another shitty deathcore nobody band. Now they are on my list of go to bands to listen to. "

"Teaser for Born of Osiris' Lee McKinney's debut solo track ""Skylasher""","yea I like TWDA too, but vocals definitely adds a layer that I think music like this needs. Not to mention not all the leads are super shreddy in TWDA and some are rather melodic or simple.

"New Steven Wilson album","I remember reading something a couple of months ago about the possibitlity of new PT in 2016, or at least a plan to start writing then."
"New Steven Wilson album","There was an article recently of Steven shutting that rumor down.  In hindsight, the rumor might have stemmed from Gavin Harrison's new album of reworked PT songs coming out soon."
"New Steven Wilson album","I found the article &amp; now that I re-read it, def not very reliable.  Shame.  At least there's plenty of amazing PT music out there anyway.

http://www.metalinsider.net/news/steven-wilson-to-possibly-resume-porcupine-tree-in-2016"
"New Steven Wilson album","I'm looking forward to this album so much.

I do have to disagree with this statement by the reviewer though : 
&gt;The second track, “Hand.Cannot.Erase” is nontraditional for a Steven Wilson album as it is a simple 4 minute pop song

Steven hasn't exactly been shy to delve into the pop music world. However Hand. Cannot. Erase. (the song) is certainly the poppiest he's gone since 1999 with Stupid Dream."
"New Steven Wilson album","And even so, that song has a lot more going on that just being a ""simple pop song."""
"New Steven Wilson album","Agreed. It seems odd coming from a reviewer who seems to have some knowledge of the PT back catalog that he would make such sweeping statements. He even mentions In Absentia and Lightbulb Sun which in themselves have some pretty poppy moments."
"New Steven Wilson album","I didn't expect another album so soon. This dude is prolific. I'm looking forward to hearing it."
"New Steven Wilson album","The last one was 2 years ago, that seems pretty standard.

Granted he does a lot of remixing on the side, but he said that's usually a relatively quick process."

"Ænimus - ""Masterpiece"" (playthrough)","I had heard of these guys before buy just picked up their album last week. Highly enjoying my purchase! One of the guitarists, Miles Dimitri Baker, has another project named Interloper. Enjoy!

He also just joined Rings of Saturn!"
"Ænimus - ""Masterpiece"" (playthrough)","Thanks a lot! That dude is crazy good.  How does he come up with this stuff? He somehow makes shred sound very tasteful "
"Ænimus - ""Masterpiece"" (playthrough)","The huge difference in style from Interloper to Aenimus is crazy to me. I would dare say it's a result of his training in classical and music theory. This is from his About section on the official Aenimus site: 

&gt; I took music theory lessons, as well as guitar lessons (electric &amp; classical). Since then I have loved writing music as well as practicing guitar to get as good as I can be, I never feel like I will be there, but I am sure no one does. My favorite types of music are Classical and Progressive Metal."
"Ænimus - ""Masterpiece"" (playthrough)","Their guitarists always seemed pretty talented, especially the 2nd lead they brought in. But they would always spam their facebook page with unimportant bullshit and I sort of blacklisted them. Can't say it was a mature decision, but neither was posting about beef curtains every second week."
"Beasteater - East of the Wall. Always makes my jaw drop.",""
"Beasteater - East of the Wall. Always makes my jaw drop.","Still can't get over how dynamic and versatile and colorful this album is. And how well this band makes their ideas and phrases flow into one another. And how fresh this album sounds 4+ years after it's initial release. I get the goosebumps every time I listen. "
"Beasteater - East of the Wall. Always makes my jaw drop.","Seeing them play live with Intronaut was one of the best shows I've been to. Every time I listen to them blows my mind.
"
"Beasteater - East of the Wall. Always makes my jaw drop.","You saw them with Intronaut? Ugh what a line up! I've been dying to see Intronaut again ever since they played with Ben Sharp last April. I can't believe in 3 months it will have been a year since that show. Time fucking flies. 

Anyway, I'm going to try and catch EotW in Jersey this February. Glad to hear they put on a good show! "
"Beasteater - East of the Wall. Always makes my jaw drop.","Yeah it was the first time hearing both, so God knows I wasn't prepared for the amazingness. Aha"
"Beasteater - East of the Wall. Always makes my jaw drop.","Listened this song, and then Obfuscator Dye and holy shit these guys are good.  "
"Beasteater - East of the Wall. Always makes my jaw drop.","I've been really trying to get into bands like this. I haven't been able to get into the black metal type vibe yet. Bands like Intronaut, Anciients, and this are something I'd really like to get into."
"Beasteater - East of the Wall. Always makes my jaw drop.","Hmm I'm not sure I'd classify this as black metal. Actually, I'm sure of it. But if you're looking to get into Intronaut either Valley of Smoke and Habitual Levitations are more accessible than their earlier works and I love both of those albums dearly. If you're into groovy, polyrhythmic music, Intronaut should be a sinch to dive into. If  that's not your bag, I'd look elsewhere. 

Anciients, to my knowledge, only has one album but I was never able to get into it. Though I admittedly never tried very hard, and I probably should as I've heard their sound is heavily Opeth influenced. 

As for this band, and all progressive metal in general, I simply suggest giving songs and albums multiple listens before trying to assess how you feel about the music. Give it a chance to stick. It takes a while for patterns and melodies and arrangements to sink in with this kind of music, but that's why i love it. 

Who are some of your favorite metal groups? "
"Beasteater - East of the Wall. Always makes my jaw drop.","Yeah, Black metal is probably the wrong term. But, the bands kind of share a certain sound that's really interesting that I haven't had the chance to dig into yet. 

&amp;nbsp;

My favorite bands are:

Protest the Hero

Symphony X

Corelia

Periphery

The Helix Nebula

Intervals

Those are the bands I listen to most often."

"New Steven Wilson material never disappoints - Home Invasion [[ Hand. Cannot. Erase. ]]","I'm not very familiar with most of his work - I've listened to a couple of Porcupine Tree albums and Raven. So far I really like this one, because it's so diverse. It's got some cool industrial/ambient songs on it, some songs bordering pop, some amazing - and sometimes heavy - 70s prog parts (Like this one) and then there are eerie, haunting songs like ""Ancestral"", which so far, is my absolute favorite."

Sure, all the songs are very catchy and fun to sing along to, but this song in particular captures so much emotion. I personally struggle with alot of self-confidence issues and feel like I can relate to the song alot. At 4:36 when all the instruments calmly roll into that repeated melody, it never fails to give me chills. 

 I also love how, inverse to typical pop music, the verse is very simple and catchy, whereas the chorus is fairly dissonant and eery. One of my favorite 'sad songs' of all time."

Migrant was a way to add lighter songs so he doesn't have to kill his voice singing on tour like he would have to if he only sang songs from Act II/Act III (also he wanted a way to express himself that wasn't tied to a concept).

"Lobotomize the Leader - Delta Orionis. Technically shouldn't be posting this because our albums not released yet, but what do you dudes think of this?","It's proficient. Sounds like you have the potential to write something interesting, but for the moment at least, I'm not hearing any new ideas. Seems like it's just regurgitated djent riffs at this point.

That being said, I'm a lot pickier than a lot of people. I want to hear something new, something I haven't heard before. That's what makes me sit up and pay attention. Not everyone's like that."
"Lobotomize the Leader - Delta Orionis. Technically shouldn't be posting this because our albums not released yet, but what do you dudes think of this?","I'm siding with this, and bear in mind that this is me being particularly critical because you're new and you asked. 

I enjoy djent and this is some pretty good djent, but I generally don't get really into a band unless there's something particularly notable about it. I enjoy it, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back to it."
"Lobotomize the Leader - Delta Orionis. Technically shouldn't be posting this because our albums not released yet, but what do you dudes think of this?","Just for curiosity's sake, check out the link I gave to the guy below and tell me what you think. I'm not expecting people to be blown away, as a matter of fact this is a better response than I had hoped because it actually is constructive criticism, so thanks dude! "
"Lobotomize the Leader - Delta Orionis. Technically shouldn't be posting this because our albums not released yet, but what do you dudes think of this?","I'm really enjoying it. The riffs are sick and I'm loving that drum tone. I also appreciate how the aggressiveness in the drums. It's kind of a pet peeve of mine when drums in a djent song are just ""bass drum on root note, snare on high note,"" so it was a breath of fresh air.

Like I said, you guys are good, it's just that there are currently a lot of djent bands out there right now so it takes something unique to make me think ""I want to spend my money on this as opposed to Animals As Leaders, Tesseract, Periphery, etc""."
"Lobotomize the Leader - Delta Orionis. Technically shouldn't be posting this because our albums not released yet, but what do you dudes think of this?","I get you dude, I feel the same way sometimes. It's hard to break that 4th wall that separate's a lot of the samey bands with the unique ones. I'm generally new to writing this way to be quite honest, its only been like maybe 6 months? In my bands next endeavor I plan to really go all out, which is also dependent on how this one does honestly. But I appreciate the feedback a ton!
"
"Lobotomize the Leader - Delta Orionis. Technically shouldn't be posting this because our albums not released yet, but what do you dudes think of this?","Hey no worries man, you have nothing to be ashamed of.

"If you like the bands in the Hall of Fame, you will also like...","If you like Porcupine Tree you will probably like:

&amp;nbsp;

*Steven Wilson
*
Band leader's solo works. Kind of self-explanatory. Generally more experimental than his main band.
[Steven Wilson - Ancestral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6bF6oKJKKQ)

&amp;nbsp;

*no-man*

Steven Wilson's band from before even Porcupine Tree, together with his long-time friend  Tim Bowness. Comparable to early PT, very mellow prog with a bit of jazz, ambient and trip-hop thrown in. 

[No-Man - Together We're Stranger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8-WLOPIHNI)


&amp;nbsp;


*Blackfield*

A collaboration between Steven Wilson and Aviv Geffen. Sounds like a pop-y Porcupine Tree.

[Blackfield - Blackfield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeSr9gtfDiY)


&amp;nbsp;

*Anathema*

Started out much heavier but became much mellower with the years, then struck gold with 2010's *We’re Here Because We’re Here*. Steven Wilson also mixed a couple of tarcks for them so there's that.

[Anathema - Thin Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiVEj5hIbOo)

&amp;nbsp;

*Nosound*

A good if if rather blatant PT clone, lead by the Italian multi-instrumentalist Giancarlo Erra. Former PT drummer Chris Maitland makes an appearance from time to time. Before you ask, yes, there is a collaboration between Giancarlo Erra and Tim Bowness. It's called Memories of Machines. Guess what it sounds like.

[Nosound - In My Fears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjXKDM5wqx4)

&amp;nbsp;

*The Pineapple Thief*

Not only the band name sounds similar. A fantastic band in their own right and very prolific.

[The Pineapple Thief - Simple As That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3GMvXXd8a8)


&amp;nbsp;

*Riverside*

Many bands from the recent wave of Polish prog seem to be very much influenced by Porcupine Tree's heavier albums. Riverside are arguably the biggest of them all but there are many others.

[Riverside - The Depth Of Self-Delusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuIflRajVvw)


&amp;nbsp;

*Lunatic Soul*

Solo project from Riverside's Mariusz Duda. A bit mellower than his main band.

[Lunatic Soul - Cold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dIoBU-mJ64)


&amp;nbsp;

*Crippled Black Phoenix*

A strange kind of genre-defying rock music. Consistently great but takes some time to get used to.

[Crippled Black Phoenix - No! 1+2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GrBji-45B4)

&amp;nbsp;

*Oceansize*

One of my favourite bands ever. Toured together with Porcupine Tree and as Steven Wilson put it:

*""[...]But our fans really dig them a lot. They've been out with us two or three times and they keep coming back and I think the reason they keep coming back is because they make new fans every time they come and play with us. And in some ways that's the biggest thrill of all for me to know that we can introduce music that I love, that we love - and I'm a huge Oceansize fan - to new people and to our fans, I mean they're super nice guys, it's always a pleasure to tour with those guys.""*

[Oceansize - Ornament, The Last Wrongs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYAF_MgV0JA)

&amp;nbsp;

Not to brag or anything but I could probably list 20-30 bands or collaborations but I gotta run. Sadly, you can't live off music alone.

"I'm new here and I'm on a search.","Hello everyone. I'm new here and I'm looking for your help. I have a wide variety in tastes among the many metal sub-genres. Problem is, I want more prog metal. I already know about DT, FW, Mastodon, Opeth, etc. They're really great bands and musicians. (DT's ""Awake"" is one of my absolute favorite albums) A few days ago I picked up Tesseract's latest album and I love it. I've never heard anything like it. I've also been trying really hard to get into Periphery but it isn't working too well. This is where I need your help.

"I'm new here and I'm on a search.","I like this. Thank you for your input!"
"I'm new here and I'm on a search.","Caligula's Horse has been mentioned. Other fairly popular groups on this sub include Karnivool (personal second favorite of mine), Between the Buried and me, Protest the Hero, Cloudkicker, Disperse, and Ne Obliviscaris. Certainly not EVERYTHING prog metal has to offer, but that's a good smattering of styles to start with.

Honestly, I'd start by choosing a singing style you tend to like and look through. Give stuff a general listen, and if you like it, dig through their discography a little more. That's how I tend to find good artists on this sub."
"I'm new here and I'm on a search.","Thanks. I will check out a couple of those as soon as I can. I know about BTBAM and have seen them live on the Summer Slaughter tour with Cannibal Corpse.

"I'm new here and I'm on a search.","Leprous, Intervals, Animals as Leaders, Myrath, Karnivool, Porcupine Tree, Cloudkicker, Disperse and Haken are a couple of my favorites and all worth listening to! As for Periphery I didn't like them upon first listen either. But after giving P2 numerous listens they're probably one of my favorite bands. Give it some time and you'll probably feel the same way "
"I'm new here and I'm on a search.","Thanks. I know of Animals as Leaders (they're from my regional area). Definitely know about Porcupine Tree. Steven Wilson is a great musician. Other than that, will definitely check out what you mentioned. Thank you!"

"I'm new here and I'm on a search.","Check out The Safety Fire. Here's the video for their song [Yellowism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0bv6zvUSPc). They play this beautiful style with lots of contrast. The music is both heavy and beautiful. Menacing and Enchanting. Like a Jagwar :D

more great bands: Protest The Hero, Between The Buried And Me, The Contortionist, SikTh, Destrage, Dionaea, The Dillinger Escape Plan, The Ocean...

I also *REALLY* love Periphery. I'm actually wearing a shirt right now :D Their newest double album Juggernaut is an emotional masterpiece in my opinion, although a bit transparent after many listens. Their other releases are great too."

"I'm new here and I'm on a search.","I'm going to second Karnivool, their first album is my favourite, but the second is still awesome after you give it a bit of time. But yeah, check them out, you won't regret it!"
"I'm new here and I'm on a search.","Riverside, Intronaut, Cynic, Exivious, Haken, Headspace, Pain of Salvation, Devin Townsend, Ayreon, Anathema, Distorted Harmony, Oceansize, Gojira.  A pretty wide range of stuff right there, and none of it really in the direction of Periphery's style of music since you're not digging that."

"I'm new here and I'm on a search.","Try Uneven Structure.  They're groovy and atmospheric like TesseracT but a bit heavier.  The vocal style is polarizing, but I like it.  the cleans aren't so high pitched.  Almost alt-sounding.  Their album Februus is pretty killer."

But yeah, the breakdown you mention was one of the last ones I conquered.  It was like the final boss of the album.  I basically just had this album playing in my car non-stop for like 3 months.  "

"Periphery - Ji","Yea Periphery 2, didn't start off as a strong one for me but really grew. Do me a favour and check out the new monuments album - amanuensis and give it atleast 4 - 5 listens.

"Periphery - Ji","Rgnarok - can't get enough of it.. Congrats on nailing Tesseract! I got concealing the faith, but Altered state will take a lot more listens. That Sax solo though...mmmm"
"Periphery - Ji","It's all about thinking about how Misha likes to put together patterns. He likes to do stuff alternating between 1 note, 2 note and 3 note patterns. You have to view it as a series of short patterns put together. Kind of hard to explain but it took me a long time to get that rhythm until I viewed it in that way and then it just clicked into place.

If ""*"" is palm mutes and the numbers are notes, it goes something like:

1 \*1 \*\*123 \*\*1 \*\*12 \*\*1 \*\*123

So you just have to ignore the palm muted notes and concentrate on the down strokes, which go in patterns of 1-3-1-2. Then he likes to throw in little grace notes to invert the pattern, but you just have memorize where those are.

"Periphery - Ji","I coulda swore I heard it was tracked with 9s.....meh 8s...whatever. Its thicker than normal. "
"Periphery - Ji","They tracked it with that awesome swirly RG8 the one dude used to own! Also, when I saw them play it live it was on 8 strings"

"Guthrie Govan - Waves [Because why not?]","Such an amazing riff. My goodness how liquid it sounds. I love that man. "
"Guthrie Govan - Waves [Because why not?]","I know...everything about his tone and approach is just so....buttery smooth.

I was watching a video the other night about his fretless interval tapping and how he was saxophone influenced or something along those lines. Guthrie's whole approach suddenly made more sense after hearing that.

I almost never listen to instrumental music any more, but damn if I don't still love Erotic Cakes."
"Guthrie Govan - Waves [Because why not?]","Ahh yes, I recall that video. I believe he said he grew up always hearing arpeggios on the sax which produced a much more liquid sound compared to arps on guitar via using a pick. So instead of using a pick he decides to master sweep arpeggio technique with multi-string tapping. So good.  "
"Guthrie Govan - Waves [Because why not?]","This whole album is a masterpiece"
"Guthrie Govan - Waves [Because why not?]","He wrote this song when he was much younger, actually. I think he said he was trying to go for a 'fretless' guitar vibe. I should get one of those..."
"Guthrie Govan - Waves [Because why not?]","and in later years he just straight up got a fretless guitar O_o https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yshLWYjMijo"
"Guthrie Govan - Waves [Because why not?]","I doubt any album will ever top this for me unless he puts out another solo album. Perfect in every single way, inviting such an incredible range and amount of emotions, just absolutely fantastic."

"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","If they're from a metal background, show them Train of Thought.  If they're from a prog background, show them Octavarium."
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","I'm a bit of both metal and prog so which album by them combines both styles?"
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","Maybe Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (one side is concept, the other is normal songs.  combines both about evenly), Images and Words (very melodic and catchy, but is also metal and prog.  one of the landmark prog metal albums), or Systematic Chaos (more metal sounding, but has prog arrangements and complicated music).  They're all different in that they combine both in different ways, but they are all good."
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","Thanks!!"
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","I second the Six Degrees. A Change of Seasons is phenomenal and a little closer to prog than metal. Awake is really dark sounding though the prog is a bit stripped down. Images and Words is my personal favorite alongside Metropolis, but it's really proggy so it may be a bit of an acquired taste."
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","I used to be a huge huge fan of DT (hence the user name). I absolutely love Falling Into Infinity, regardless of all the shit they went through with the agency while making it. Hells Kitchen and Lines In The Sand blow my mind every time (playing and listening). Images &amp; Words is a must, and another of my personal favourites is Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance (both discs). "
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","Do you still find DT enjoyable?

What other ProgMetal bands can you recommend for me?"
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","If you enjoyed DT and you are looking for a new band to listen to:

HAKEN.

Seriously.

H A K E N!"
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","Haken is godtier!"
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","I make it a special ""date"" thing. Lately I've been much more into Prog Rock, so it's like... It's DT time! And I head bang and sing like the good old days. 

A few awesome Prog metal bands I love are: Ayreon, Liquid Tension Experiment (instead of John Myung, they have the legendary Tony Levin on bass/chapman stick), Enchant, Queensryche, Symphony X, Tool, Angra.. Maybe also go back to one of the biggest influences: Black Sabbath.

I can be of much more help if you want Prog Rock!
 "
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","Depends of what you liked the most in that album. I'd go for the older stuff like Images and Words since it has the first part of metropolis or Awake because it's very good. From the modern albums I'd go for the second disc of Six degrees or octavarium. "
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","I pretty much like ALL of DT's Discography EXCEPT When Day And Dream Unite and Falling Into Infinity"
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","When dream and day unite is awesome. Try When dream and day reunite"
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","Thanks for the suggestion!"
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","Images and words and octavarium"
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","Falling into Infinity. It gets a lot of flack from a lot of fans, but the fact is, after listening to an album that is so interconnected, the lighter feeling of Falling Into Infinity is a welcome transition. It's serious, but not overbearing, with plenty of lighter moments musically. 

Either that or, if you enjoyed the theme of interconnectedness, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. It has strong motifs throughout the album and each song but has a lot of musical dynamic to it. Highly recommend."
"Best Dream Theater Albums to listen to after MP2SFAM? (x-post from r/Dreamtheater)","I'm sure I'm alone in saying this, but Systematic Chaos was a pretty good album. Not on the level of Scenes from a Memory, but still good, especially In the Presence of Enemies. 

Otherwise, go for Images and Words, Octavarium or Train of Thought.  "

If you're a Canadian or Quebecker, the lyrics would get you right away: ""*One man standing on the plains of Abraham, Watching a damaged sunrise, One man standing near the edge of a quiet Breakdown*."" This album came out in 2000. It was an interesting alternative to the Rush stuff but with still a bit of the flavor of course. [Album details](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Favourite_Headache)

It's an alternate dimension where Geddy let himself experiment a bit further. Indeed an underrated album, and we would be open for more."

"What is your early prediction for prog album of the year 2015?","Five-Way tie between Periphery, Corelia, BTBAM, The Safety Fire, and TesseracT.

Edit; Added TesseracT.  "
"What is your early prediction for prog album of the year 2015?","Tesseract is supposed to have one this summer"
"What is your early prediction for prog album of the year 2015?","predicting a toss up between btbam and corelia"
"What is your early prediction for prog album of the year 2015?","So many records still coming out, some of which might not even make it this year. 
New Faith No More, BTBAM, Code, etc. but it's really the underdogs you have to watch out for. Hell, there is even going to be a new Anthropia album.

So far Arcane's Known/Learned is the album to beat. The semi-title track Learned is also going to be a strong contender for best song of the year."
"What is your early prediction for prog album of the year 2015?","Is promise part 2 supposed to be the first song? If not, I think spotify has it all fucked up. I don't even see learned as a track.

Edit: Spotify mobile did have it fucked up. It had the two albums mixed together. Unfortunately, Learned(The song) isn't available, so that sucks."
"What is your early prediction for prog album of the year 2015?","Yeah, I hate it when Spotify randomly fucks up albums. I went to see Earth earlier today and I wanted to listen to some Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light in preparation but half the album is just gone. I mean, if an entire album isn't there, I get it, you don't have the rights etc. but it's hard to understand why they butcher albums like this.

Anyways, the song is available [on their Bandcamp](http://arcaneaustralia.bandcamp.com/track/learned)."
"What is your early prediction for prog album of the year 2015?","Corelia, BTBAM, Tesseract, Uneven Structure, Native Construct."
"What is your early prediction for prog album of the year 2015?","TesseracT."
"What is your early prediction for prog album of the year 2015?","Leprous or BTBAM"
"What is your early prediction for prog album of the year 2015?","I'm going with Corelia"
"What is your early prediction for prog album of the year 2015?","Definitely BTBAM, Slice The Cake, Ovid's Withering or Uneven Structure as top contenders. More leaning towards Uneven Structure or Ovdi since it'll be hard to top something like BTBAM's Parallax II IMO. 

Don't get me wrong, BTBAM are my favorite band and I'm looking forward to their rock opera, but there's more room for disappointment after the last album (which is not saying much)"
"What is your early prediction for prog album of the year 2015?","Already i think Known/Learned by Arcane. Been waiting for it ages and i love it. I'd be really surprised (but obviously happy) if anything surpassed it."

"What is your early prediction for prog album of the year 2015?","For me, it'll probably be a toss up between Haken's new record (especially if it ends up sounding anything like Restoration) and Black Plastic Sun by Abigail's Ghost, if it does get dropped this year. My favorite so far has been Arcane's new album. Jim Gray never fails to disappoint."
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","I've heard a couple songs by them before (Prancer, One of Us is the Killer, and another one I can't recall at this moment). Anyway, I'd really love to get into them more, but I don't really know which album to start with. Any suggestions are appreciated; any explanations are even better."
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","I'd recommend miss machine to start out with. There are a few poppier songs that I don't personally enjoy but the rest of the  album captures dillinger at some of their most intense, technical, and experimental moments. Ire works is similar, but with more experimental tracks. Calculating infinity has a different singer and is pure face melting madness. One of us is the killer has the two tracks you mentioned and is amazing as well. I'm a newer fan and have yet to listen to option paralysis, but have heard great things about it. "
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","You should definitely check it out. Farewell, Mona Lisa and Widower are my favorite off of it. It has a good combination of the sound from ire works and one of us is the killer (since its between those two) and the first album billy rymer recorded with them. Gil Sharon is fantastic on ire works but I like billy better for some reason"
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","I just took your advice and it was amazing. I think its going to quickly become one of my favorites from dillinger"
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","I personally started on Ire Works, pretty solid album IMO."
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","One Of Us Is The Killer is their most accessible album, I'd say work backwards from there."
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","That's what I did. No ragrets."
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","I'm fond of Option Paralysis's first few tracks. Farewell, Mona Lisa. Good Neighbor. And Gold Teeth on a Bum."
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","""Widower"" is my favorite track from Option Paralysis. It builds up so perfectly to such an incredible chorus."
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","One of my favorite songs of all time"
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","""43% Burnt""  from ""Calculating Infinity"" gives you a pretty good understanding of what DEP is all about. For an overall cleaner sound I would try their single ""Milk Lizard"" off the album ""Ire Works""."
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","Ire Works then Option Paralysis then Miss Machine then One of Us Is the Killer. Do it in that order then randomly pick whatever albums are left. Only do it this way because I told you so. "
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","Do what this guy says (only because that's also the order I did it and I don't appear to have died)"
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","I feel that TDEP won't ""click"" until you hear a full album.  Try Ire Works all the way through and see how you enjoy it.  "
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","Can't go wrong with with Ire Works, Option Paralysis, or One of Us is the Killer. I think I'd recommend One of Us first, as I think it's their best album by far. 

Also, if you're a Mike Patton fan, they did an EP together - Irony is a Dead Scene - which is equal parts awesome DEP, and awesome Patton. "
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","In my opinion Option Paralysis is their most cohesive and most progressive album. It's also my absolute favorite(of any band ever). Each song is a masterpiece and the whole thing is just the most dynamic record I've ever heard.

It took me a lot of time to really get into Calculating Infinity, because it is SO extremely experimental and complex, but now I love it, too. But Option Paralysis was easier. Although It got better and better, because it revealed more and more aspects of itself.

Each album is great and a masterpiece in it's own way, but in my opinion calculating infinity is the best for pure mathcore and Option Paralysis is the best for pure dynamic math/prog"
"Where to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?","DEP, haven't heard that name for a long time. I can't remember the song titles unfourtunaly buuuut... I can share you a quick story from their gig.

I was like 19 y/o when Dillinger visited my city. Without thinking I bought a ticket, gathered my friends and went there. We were so hyped up as we've saw on youtube how wild their gigs could be. During their third song everyone went nuts- wall of death etc. Then the vocalist decided to run from stage on our heads (literally stepping on our heads). I had the bruise on my forehead for like 3 weeks. I didn't care- BEST.GIG.EVER.  I wish you good luck on your journey, young fellow : )"

"TesseracT - Eden","Yeah seriously, this version just builds up so much better and the payoff at the end is such an amazing close to the album. 6:32 is freaking interdimensional!"
"TesseracT - Eden","Sunrise challenged me the first time I heard it.  I thought the opening riff was laughably simple, just the same note in that pattern.  But as the song progresses towards the end and builds back to that same riff with all those other elements on top of it it hits you like a ton of bricks.  Such amazing songwriting, I could see myself writing that opening riff easily enough but it takes a genius like Acle to turn it into what it becomes."
"TesseracT - Eden","It feels more like the original Eden is the 2.0 version and this one is the original"
"TesseracT - Eden","Favorite song off the album, love this one!

"Bands with only one guitarist?","Also, if you watch some talks Petrucci has done he talks about changing the way he plays to give a slightly thicker sound due to only having one guitarist.  "
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Thank You Scientist only have one guitarist. I saw them live with Periphery on Friday and they melted my face. "
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Thank You Scientist killed it when they were in Portland. So much energy!"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Yeah I never really listened to them but they were amazing and I immediately bought their album on vinyl. Should be here anyday "
"Bands with only one guitarist?","I was there at the Fillmore too! Band kicks ass. Got them to sign my CD too"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Damn, now i really wish i would of went over to their merch table, but i had front row and I didn't want to lose it.
"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","They were there signing after the show was already over"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","I was upset because they were the only band besides Periphery on that bill which I wanted to see, and they couldn't make it to my city :("
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Dysrhythmia

Tool"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Dysrhythmia is a great example of a prog band with one guitar player who really finds good ways to explore the space left by not having a second guitar.  I love Kevin Hufnagel's playing.  He's a fucking beast.

Cynic is also a great band with only one guitar player.  And I love  Baring Teeth."
"Bands with only one guitarist?","A lot of that space is filled by having a great bass player who uses a pick and sounds like a second guitar in many cases.  This is certainly true for Colin Marston and Justin Chancellor.  Half the time you can't even tell which part is being played by which instrument.  Love that shit."
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Dysrhythmia is a band that can be truly described as ""stacked.""  I love the sound of one guitar and one bass, especially when they're really killer players.  The guitarist that doesn't have a second guitar player to worry about can really make some dynamic and bold textural choices.  

I've come to prefer a one-guitar configuration for that reason."

"Bands with only one guitarist?","The Fall of Troy. Thomas is a beast"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Gospel"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Nobody's said Yes?"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Born of Osiris only has Lee McKinney now"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Yeah, though the only two albums with Lee McKinney being the only guitarist is A Higher Place and Tomorrow We Die Alive."
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Also, A Higher Place was recorded with a Lead and Rhythm guitar and when they toured that album they needed guitarists to tour with them (Tosin Abasi, Lee Evans). So even then their was not really one guitar."
"Bands with only one guitarist?","I honestly hate A Higher Place. "
"Bands with only one guitarist?","[Dionaea](http://dionaea.bandcamp.com/album/still) "
"Bands with only one guitarist?","The Aristocrats, Tool, Rush, Symphony X"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Erra is one of my favorite bands hands down.  I'm not sure about their albums, Impulse and Augment, but their new EP, Moments of Clarity, only uses one guitarist.  Honestly, every song on it is good, but my favorites are [Dreamcatcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI2a0firXFc) and [Lights City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZPhrc6G1mg)"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","How do they play it live though? that's the big problem here for us, they may only have one guitarist, but they are multitracking a ton.  We not superduper prog, more in the gojira progressive death kinda thing, so it might be a smidgen easier, but this stuff all has heavy usage of multiple guitars."
"Bands with only one guitarist?","I can't say for sure, but in all likelihood: backing tracks out the ASS"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","True but I've really wanted to avoid this.  I'm more of a traditional death and black metal guy, so the realm of prog is a bit new to me and so is all the layering and effects and stuff, so maybe my avoidance is just because I have no experience with it."
"Bands with only one guitarist?","well you could take the dream theater approach and have a dual amp set up for your rhythm guitars. You could also maybe try experimenting with live-looping Animals as Leaders-style"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","They have a second guitarist live, no  sure if he is part of the band or just a touring member. "
"Bands with only one guitarist?","The bassist moved to guitar and they have a touring bassist."
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Frost* has only one guitarist. Their keyboard work amazes me to the point that I wasn't sure if they had a guitarist until I looked them up."
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Alaya
"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Ayreon"
"Bands with only one guitarist?","Ayreon isn't really a band, it's a guys solo thing and each album has like a million musicians on it, they are kick-ass though."
"Bands with only one guitarist?","i dont know if you consider it prog metal but born of osiris only has one guitarist and they are pretty amazing."

"What are your top 10 Progressive Metal Bands at this current point in time?","[deleted]"
"What are your top 10 Progressive Metal Bands at this current point in time?","That's difficult to think of, but the first ones that come to mind are:

 * [Cynthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWN1TD-etW4) - Traditional and minimalistic progressive metal/rock, lots of focus on atmosphere. Clean voacls.

 * [Solefald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9aSymmizxM) - Avant-garde metal, with a black metal foundation at the start of their career. Just released their 8th album. Mixed vocals, harsh on their first album and usually clean on the rest.

 * [Vulture Industries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acZ_pm7R22Q) - Very theatric progressive metal. Mixed vocals, mostly clean.

 * [Alchemist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrbJkTqXw_k) - Sort of what Pink Floyd would sound like if they played death metal. Mixed vocals, mostly harsh.

 * [Fates Warning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIq33Igj8VI) - Traditional progressive metal. Clean vocals.

 * [Voivod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3uV_ZuPOcw) - Progressive thrash metal. Clean vocals.

 * [Arcturus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTQmWHGNGZM) - Avant-garde black metal, big emphasis on keyboards and theatrics. Mixed vocals.

 * [Gorguts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk7nb-idmdI) - Technical death metal, pushing dissonance in metal to the extreme. Harsh vocals.

 * [Sieges Even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ums7ixW-WLc) - Progressive rock/metal, very atmospheric and introspective. Clean vocals.

 * [Neurosis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omKId6Lhr3A) - Post-metal (or atmospheric sludge metal), the first in their genre. Mixed vocals."

"What are your top 10 Progressive Metal Bands at this current point in time?","I really enjoyed The Haarp Machine's first album. Too bad the guitarist is a douche and no one will stay in the band.

"What are your top 10 Progressive Metal Bands at this current point in time?","Difficult, but without giving it too much thought (and without going into things usually classified as avant-garde metal), I'd probably go with: (in alphabetical order)

* Opeth
* Orphaned Land

"What are your top 10 Progressive Metal Bands at this current point in time?","Out of curiosity, what would you include if avant-garde metal was on the table?"
"What are your top 10 Progressive Metal Bands at this current point in time?","Hmm, these definitely wouldn't all make it, but I love bands like Angizia, Unexpect, Pan-Thy-Monium, Sigh, Diablo Swing Orchestra, Akphaezya, Solefald, Ulver, Dødheimsgard, Vampillia. Now that I think about it, it's probably only Ayreon that would risk getting pushed off the list in favor of Angizia. And I'm also not sure why I didn't put Sleepytime Gorilla Museum in this latter category. "
"What are your top 10 Progressive Metal Bands at this current point in time?","I assume DT is #1 band not worth mentioning in every list?"

"What are your top 10 Progressive Metal Bands at this current point in time?","Yea, please do. I listened to the album over 20 times since i first heard it a couple weeks ago.

I'd also like to mention that my top prog metal albums will include The Contortionist's Exoplanet and Language, and Last Chance To Reason's Level 2, but I don't like the other three albums that came from those bands at all, so I can't call them top bands.

Almost all of my attention lately has been other genres, specifically old school heavy metal and doom metal. I don't know if I can even list ten, but I'll make an attempt just as an exercise for myself more than anyone else:

* Ayreon
* Fates Warning
* Jester's March
* Myrath
* Queensryche
* Threshold
* Time Machine

That's as far as I can get right now, can't think of others I'd add off the top of my head. Maybe single albums but whole bands? That's a lot tougher for me.

I also notice a lot of my favourites have been around for ages. I don't think any of the bands I've listed have been around less than ten years (with one exception).

Sorry I failed you OP, I offer an honourable seppuku in recompense."

"Mish - Fire Inside - [6:59]","Yet another young Australian band, somewhere between modern Prog Metal and energetic Post-Rock. Their debut titled *The Entrance* is already a couple of years old but a second album is apparently in pre-production, so that's nice."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","I've been wanting to listen to Between the Buried and Me for some time now but I don't know what album to start listening to first. Can you guys name the greatest albums?"
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","Colors. Just listen to Colors start to finish first."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","BTBAM has been added to this subreddit's 'Hall of Fame'. You can find their article [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/wiki/halloffame/btbam), including a list of user-voted songs!

This should give you a good overview!"
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","COLORS."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","Everyone's gonna say Colors, and that's okay, because it's an awesome album. Personally, though, I got way more into Alaska. All Bodies, Roboturner and Selkies are my absolute favorite BTBAM songs."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","The Parallax II: Future Sequence is the one that really got me into BTBAM."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","ALASKA"
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","Alaska is what got me into them"
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","Came here to say this! OP, start with Alaska. Then probably Colors or ParII. Then go back and listen to how intricate Alaska is really is, and they've stuck true to their roots. "
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","Shit, started to fanboy. "
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","The bassist to btbam is in another band called trioscapes. They're amazing check them out too."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","what /u/NMEMine said.  
  
I'd say most people are going to say Colors and move towards the future. I found everything pre-Colors unstructured and difficult to get into.  
  
edit: also check out another also band called [Black Crown Initiate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhY8-iJnZ-M). They have some BTBAM vibes going on but do their own thing."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","&gt; I found everything pre-Colors unstructured and difficult to get into.

Even Alaska?  I loved that album."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","I like Selkies and that's about it. Everything Colors and beyond, like every song on those albums, I found to be enjoyable. And I find it rare to enjoy full albums."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","I think Alaska is the most coherent and structured album by them. Every songs flows well.  I love all their  albums, but Alaska is my favorite. "
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","Black Crown Initiate are so good. "
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","A number of the links in the Hall could use some updating. Or at least the first few I clicked on."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","not my area of the sub, but I'm sure if you sent some links or items that needed to be updated to the modmail, the other mods would probably take care of it fairly quickly."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","This makes me happy that someone mentioned that band here. Black crown is so awesome and their new album is dope. BTBAM is like brie cheese of metal in my opinion."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","I went a weird way of Future Sequence, Colors, The Silent Circus, Alaska, then The Great Misdirect.

Everything other than their self titled is great. They started being prog with colors, though their earlier work has a lot prog elements.

Future Sequence or Colors is a great place to start. Mordecai and Selkies are great singles that need listening. Almost all of the rest of their material is great also. BTBAM is a bit of an acquired taste, so I would recommend actively listening. Don't just use it as background music, listen and read along to the lyrics or something.

Also, I like to use [sputnikmusic](http://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/Between-the-Buried-and-Me/617/) to figure out where to start listening to a new band. A 3.0 is good, a 3.5 is better, and a 4.0+ is great. The related artists is useful too.  "
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","As amazing as Colors is, I feel there isn't enough love for Future Sequence in this thread. Maybe because is still relatively new and people are hesitant to give it the credit it deserves."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","yes. that is all."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","I've got to echo the ""Colors"" suggestion.  A few years ago I was stuck in the computer lab at school working on a project all night and put on Colors on a whim and it changed my life.  After 10 minutes or so I just stopped working altogether and just sat and listened all the way through.  That night got me into prog metal."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","alaska"
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","I love all their records, but actually started with *Alaska* and I honestly believe it's a better starting place than *Colors*."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","Colors and onward of course, but check out All Bodies and Selkies from Alaska, although the album as a whole is a bit of a mess in my opinion. Also The Great Misdirect is a favourite of mine."
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","There are more great songs on Alaska than just those 2. What about The Primer, Walaska, and Backwards Marathon?"
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","Ah yes, The Primer is a good one. But honestly, I don't really care for the rest"
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","The title track, Alaska?! "
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","Everything they have is so good. The only ""bad record"" there put out is The Great Misdirect. That's only because it was the follow up to Colors and everybody thinks that is the greatest record they ever did at the time. 

Start with colors then go to the beginning and listen on. "
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","I feel like I am opposite of all the BTBAM fans. My two favourite albums are The Great Misdirect and Parallax II: Future Sequence.

Colors is a great album, but not my favourite!"
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","Yeah, The Great Misdirect isn't a bad record at all, even considering it's placement in their discography. In fact it's what solidified me as a diehard BTBAM fan. I love Colors (obviously haha) but it was a complete departure from this less structured sound people are talking about here, which I found a bit difficult to get into. Every song on that record is fun and unique and offers an experience only BTBAM can give.

Personally though, i feel Parallax 1 &amp; 2 can't be beat. Those dual albums create one huge masterpiece. "
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","I just kind of find The Great Misdirect kind of boring with exception of ""Fossil Genera"" and ""Swim To The Moon"""
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","Colors is their best by far. "
"Albums by Between the Buried and me to suggest?","The Parallax II: Future Sequence is the most accessible album for someone who doesn't already have a taste for Prog-Metal and Colors is better for someone who's already got Prog-Blood. Future Sequence is the better album in my opinion but if you start on Colors in order to train your brain to allow BTBAM to fuck it before listening to Parallax it will make Parallax that much better."
"Bands like Gojira?","Been listening to them since I saw them open for Mastodon a year-ish ago. Are there any bands similar to them? For reference i'd say my favorite album is a tie between L'enfant Sauvage and The Way of All Flesh  Also, sorry if Gojira doesnt qualify as prog, ill take this post elsewhere.

"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","As much as I loved Nostalgia, I am skeptical about giving this band money.  They left fans hanging for nearly two years while on hiatus and now they're asking for $15k?  Producing and distributing an album along with all those perks is no small undertaking. The obvious comparison would be to PTH.  They released 3 albums and logged thousands of hours on the road before going the crowd funding route. By that point they had already earned a lot of credibility with fans and gained a solid understanding of the industry in general.  Corelia has released an EP and played a handful of shows so I'm kind of doubting their reliability. Just my opinion but still excited for some new material regardless.  "
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","They have the material written though. All that's left is to record it."
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","Fair enough.  But recording the material isn't all there is to fulfilling the pre-orders (unless you buy digital copy only).  "

"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","Don't be a dick, recording and production isn't free. If you're going to buy the record anyway, click the first perk and buy it now to support the funding campaign."
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","Yeah, no shit. My band just recorded an EP in our drummer's bedroom on $15,000 worth of gear that we purchased ourselves. Stray from the Path recorded their [last *three* Sumerian releases for $9,500 total](https://www.facebook.com/Strayfromthepath/posts/10152668833922635). If they can successfully crowdfund that much money, then more power to them, but that still doesn't mean that I agree with the concept."
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","That's great! Glad you all had the means to purchase $15K worth of gear, for a ~30 minute EP. Let us know when you're recording a 90-minute dual-disc, high production value LP. Chances are the recording equipment is not Corelia's either, sans the instruments anyways.

I mean, OF COURSE you can record an album for next to nothing, but if you're going for the real deal, then you need money to do so. No need to shit on Corelia for going this route. "
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","Yeah, it is great, because we worked our asses off for all of it alongside going to school, working, and being with our friends and families. You do not need $15,000 to record 90 minutes of professional quality music, especially if you aren't paying for any of the recording equipment. Where and how you spend your money is your prerogative and I'm only offering a different view: I'd much rather spend my money on a band that puts their own earnings into an album before those of their fans."
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","Dude fuck off. No one wants to hear your petty whiny bs. The difference is that Corelia has a large following. You don't. That is why they are going this route for funding. Why would they manually try to earn $15,000 when they have a rabid fanbase willing to fund it?"
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","Ooooooooooooo I flinched haha"
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","&gt; If they can successfully crowdfund that much money, then more power to them, but that still doesn't mean that I agree with the concept.

"
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","Well, I agree with your sentiment. We have heard about how these guys seem to struggle with their work ethic. Regardless of how good Nostalgia is I would like to see them establish themselves, since it's been years since we've really heard anything and its only been the last couple of months that they have turned up. Now they want 15k? Ehhh... "
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","A single dollar paid by 15,000 fans is nothing for being able to **forever** listen to what is sure to be a masterpiece. I think the fact its a 90 minute double disk is a pretty great announcement.

Hell, even that merch looks sick! If i had money to burn i would totally rock that cloak."
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","I'm sure it would be good but I'm keeping my expectations in check. Shouldn't be calling something a masterpiece before you even listen to it; that's just rhetoric. "
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","True, but what can i say, I'm excited and expect great things!"
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","I've been where you are right now for many different things. More often then not I've been left burned or unfulfilled. Best-worst case scenario, you delude yourself into thinking a letdown is amazing. 

I try my best to stay off the hype train because then you can see things for what they are and not judge them against made up expectations of what they should be. Feel me?

It's good to be excited though!!!"
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","I'm usually the same! I know not to trust the hype train but I also trust my taste in music and I just can't imagine this particular band creating something i won't love.

But sure, good advice! "
"Corelia releasing 2 disc debut in 2015 get hype","Have you heard the EP?  It's definitely something special"

"Barren Earth - On Lonely Towers[New Song!]","The clean vocals are certainly different than the last front man but the harsh vocals are spot on. Will take a little getting used to but overall I love the track and have high hopes for the new album overall."
"Barren Earth - On Lonely Towers[New Song!]","I dunno, I'm not really feeling the clean or harsh vocals. The clean one doesn't seem to fit the music well, and the harsh one is a bit too raspy for my liking. It may just take some getting used to, but it's a bummer since I didn't know until now that they got a new singer."

"Intervals Releases ""A Voice Within"" Instrumental","It's available on Spotify also FYI.

I think it's interesting, particularly listening to the parts where Mike's voice once was, haering all the subtle guitar riffs we've been missing out on.  

It kind of creates a new style in that the usual ""guitars as the voice"" sounds we're used to hearing in other instrumental albums isn't there.  There's more mellow parts to each song because of it. 

The other thing I've noticed is that each song follows a more typical vocal style track with clearly defined chorus etc and not much breakout to different styles within a song, again, as we're used to hearing on other instrumental tracks.

Thanks for reading.

Huh?

Some of the guitar/keys tones are similar, but music-wise this is pretty far from anything Opeth has done, or ""should have"" done.  Sounds closer to Beardfish's wheelhouse if I had to compare it to another contemporary band."

&gt;___God &amp; Guns___ is the thirteenth studio album by the [southern rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_rock) band [Lynyrd Skynyrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynyrd_Skynyrd), released on September 29, 2009. The single ""Still Unbroken"" was released on July 27, 2009 followed by another track, ""Simple Life"", on August 4, 2009. [Hughie Thomasson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughie_Thomasson) contributed to the writing of many songs, including this first single, before his death. ""Still Unbroken"" was written after the death of original bassist [Leon Wilkeson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Wilkeson) in 2001.  The album features guitar work from [John 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_5_(guitarist\)).  It is also the last Lynyrd Skynyrd album to feature the band's longtime keyboardist [Billy Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Powell), who died in January 2009. [Ean Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ean_Evans), who replaced Leon Wilkeson on bass, also died before this album came out. This album is the first with [Mark Matejka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Matejka) and [Peter Keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Keys), and the only album with [Robert Kearns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kearns) on bass.

"Opeth - Cusp Of Eternity","I don't like this new Opeth. I thought this album (and *Heritage* too) was just bland and uninspired. It's not the lack of metal, as I really liked *Damnation* and my taste in music is quite extensive. It's a shame, they used to be one of my favorite bands many years ago."
"Opeth - Cusp Of Eternity","I agree with you that Heritage for the most part was pretty bland, but I think Pale Communion, while not heavy, was a significant improvement over Heritage. I think Opeth fully adapted to their new style with Pale Communion, while Heritage was sort of a trial run in many ways. This album also has a number of great songs, like Cusp of Eternity, Eternal Rains Will Come, and Faith in Others, while in my opinion, Folklore was the only decent song from Heritage."

"Opeth - Cusp Of Eternity","I agree 100%. I like this album, but it's not anywhere near Damnation. Watershed was where you could tell Opeth were beginning to run out of fresh ideas."
"Opeth - Cusp Of Eternity","Yeah. The last Opeth album I really liked was *Ghost Reveries* tbh, but even that album was kinda ""weird"" for me. The use of keyboards, the lack of Steven Wilson's production... it definitely had some pretty fucking great moments, but really felt like a different Opeth."

"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","I really want to like this band, because the instrumentals really are interesting. A performance at the White River Amphitheater near Seattle, WA absolutely ruined them for me.

They had the worst live sound that I've ever heard, to this day (even compared to notoriously shitty performers like Bring Me the Horizon, or Asking Alexandria, yes I listen to metalcore too). The singer would repeatedly go on these egotistical tirades about how shitty our crowd was. Pretentious is the best word I can describe him, without involving expletives.

Eventually, someone got the nerve to throw a bottle of piss at the singer. It missed, but hit the guitarists stack, shorting it out. They had to walk off stage after, the crowd finally got tired of his shit.

It wasn't anyone else in the band, it was just the singer. Is he always like that? He comes off really cocky in interviews.
"
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","Thomas Pridgen would agree with you. "
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","Well, he *was* the drummer when I saw them (2006). But wasn't he just as crazy? Didn't he get kicked out for pissing on their tour bus or something?"
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","Both he and their guitarist were known for being pretty full of themselves. The band's history of going through band members like a fat kid goes through cake speaks pretty clearly about that.

As for their live sound, I've seen vids of their performances that were really good, and some that were absolute junk. As good as they were in studio, they did seem...inconsistent live."
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","Well I mean, when you look at their later releases and there's a big blurb basically shitting on the remainder of the band that isn't Cedric and Omar, you can understand exactly why they went through as many musicians as they did.

&gt;The partnership between Omar Rodríguez-López &amp; Cedric Bixler-Zavala is The Mars Volta. These compositions are then performed by The Mars Volta Group.

As far as I was aware, Omar would basically write and arrange all the music and then tell the other musicians in the studio what to play.  I'd grow pretty tired of that if I were Jon Theodore or Thomas Pridgen."
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","This whole album! Drunkship of lanterns always gets me going though."
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","This song and album are my favorite. But almost anything Cedric and Omar do together is magic.  RIP IKEY  "
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","Love that it's using triple meter.
It's practically a waltz.
Such an imaginative band."
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","Songs in 3 aren't exactly uncommon..."
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","He just wanted us all to know that he knows what 3:4 is"
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","Is that some kind of arcane knowledge to you?"
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","Such an imaginative band"
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","Did you know that in this song the guitarist actually used an electric guitar? Maybe a little out there for some people but I think these guys are blazing a bold new trail in music that others may follow!"
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","I heard they sang the songs with words "
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","I don't know any other in rock/metal song from the top of my head...
Maybe some parts here and there, but the whole song? It's kind of a unique characteristic.
It's what is drawing me to the song mainly..."
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","3/4 is the most common meter after 4/4 for songs (or even most western music) to be in. True, in progmetal you might not have as many songs that remain in 3/4 for the entire time, but that's because prog music is often characterized by changing meters. Hell, this Mars Volta song doesn't even remain in 3/4 the whole song, the section around 2:15 changes meter. 

However, within the general rock and metal spectrum, on any given album you'll have a couple songs in 3, stereotypically the more ballad-esque songs, but not uniformly.

Example: Let's take a fairly standard rock album, let's say by Yellowcard just so that I don't have to really do any research, a band that was fairly popular for a while that is certainly one of my guilty pleasures, mainly because Longineau Parsons is a pretty tasty drummer, and the addition of violin shows that they at least *tried* to make their music slightly unique, even though much of their music was run-of-the-mill. Not that I'm making excuses for my enjoyment ;)

Anyway, on my favorite Yellowcard Album, Lights and Sounds, there's 2 songs in in 3/4: [City of Devils](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxCxccmACrQ) and [How I Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQCJRbFT79Y). And they're not a particularly imaginative band.

In metal, I pulled up literally the most recently added album to my music library, Shattered Skies' 2015 debut full-length ""The World We Used to Know"". While they're more on the progressive side of things, and have more asymmetrical or changing meters, they still have the song [Elegance and Grace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjc8EQiRpbo) which is in 3/4.

Groupings of three are quite common in music, whether it's in the overall meter (duple vs. triple) or in the classification of subdivision (simple vs. compound, compound having triplet subdivisions loved by any band going for a shuffle-y or groovy feel. In other words, most of Monuments' catalog).

However, in your defense, the constant 3 against 4 polyrhythm between the drums vs. the guitar and bass lines **is** very cool, since the guitars obfuscate the fact that there is the underlying triplet meter. It doesn't sound immediately like it's in three, only when you starting hearing the cross rhythm of the high hat and whatnot do you catch that 'waltz-ish' pulse."
"The Mars Volta - Inertiatic ESP","Of course 3/4 is the most common meter after 4/4. But that wasn't my point.

In rock and metal in comparison to 4/4 (which is called common time for a reason) the 3/4 time signature is beaten in number by such a large margin, that it is a unique feature.
Especially when used so prominantly in a song, that you could dance a waltz to it (nearly) throughout.

I'm not really a fan of rock- or metal-ballads so maybe one can find more instances of it there.

Even breaking the rythmical monotony through triplets or the switch to another time signature is a very rare occasion in rock/metal (outside of prog).

One of my personal high points in music is the merging of two rythms which seem to be working against each other at first.

"Can this be progressive? [Krallice - Telluric Rings]","...Why? Serious question. I found it completely boring and worthless compared to their other three. It was like they had no good ideas left. "
"Can this be progressive? [Krallice - Telluric Rings]","Upon my first couple of listens it honestly felt impenetrable. However, after a few more it started to open up. I just love the interplay between the two guitars so much on that album. I also felt the production was stronger than on any of their previous albums. Of course, it's all subjective, but that's my two cents on it."
"Can this be progressive? [Krallice - Telluric Rings]","I thought the production on ""Dimensional Bleedthrough"", ""Diotima"" and ""Years Past Matter"" was so similar that if you shuffled all three albums together on a playlist, a new listener would have no idea which songs came from which album. The guitar interplay is certainly one of the many things that makes Krallice great, but I thought that worked itself out best in their earlier stuff (the pinnacle being the final 5 minutes of ""Forgiveness in Rot""). "
"Can this be progressive? [Krallice - Telluric Rings]","You make good points. Ultimately though, there's just something about YPM that resonates with me. Krallice has such a raw approach to songwriting and their sound in general that it has that sort of unnamable quality to it that draws you in like that. And if it doesn't work, then it just doesn't work."

This happens in any music sub where a popular band is releasing something. I honestly think Corelia deserves to be posted as much as possible within the confines of the rules. They are not banking money like other popular prog bands. 20,000+ people don't browse the sub every day.  
  
Also, the 3 people that do hit the report button helps *immensely*. It allows me to get to things quick, especially on mobile.

"[META] Improve your /r/progmetal browsing experience","There was a point about 6 months ago when everyone was posting Dream Theater, so there'd be about 3 DT songs a day. What if there was a rule that said to not post more than one thing per band a day. So for example, if someone posts an update about Corelia, they can't post a song by Corelia on the same day. Also no more than 1 song by a band per day would be neat. Obviously there could be some exceptions, like if someone was to have posted a song by PtH, and on that same day PtH announced a release date for their next album, you could post the article.

This isn't really a majour concern, and I don't think it's that necessary unless this sub gets much bigger. That being said, there's currently 6 Periphery posts on the front page including the discussion page, whereas /r/peripheryband is practically dead in comparison.

"Let's talk about live sound","So last night my buddy and I were lucky enough to see The Contortionist/Revocation/Fallujah show. All three of thise bands feature fantastic musicians who not only excel in musicianship, but also crafting great songs.

That said, the wild inconsistency in live SOUND quality drives me crazy. Not necessarily between venues - that's a given. I'm talking about between bands playing the same gig. 

Take the first of those bands to play, Fallujah. Their sound is a very melodic and harmonious one. One of the things my ear gravitates towards is the intricate melodies layed by their guitarists. But I swear, if I had never listened to Fallujah before last night, i wouldn't have had the slightest clue what was going on. The guitars were barely audible even during the solos - smothered beneath a wall of muddled bass and vocals.

So the night moves on. Revocation is on next. Dave Davidson does a breif sound check and gets the balance he likes and they start jamming. This mix is a step up - not ideal, but this time I can discern actual riffs. I'm not super familiar with their catalogue so it was a good barometer for the clarity of sound. 

Finally the contortionist. Crystal clear sound. The bass drum is a nice balanced trigger (I think it was triggered) and doesn't overpower on the low end. The guitars are razor sharp and the bass has a nice thwack to it without muddling everything up.

So why is there so little consistency? Are some performers simply unaware of their mix or is it a question of available gear when opening versus headlining? Anyone out there with mixing experience I'd love to hear what you think.

Edit: Thanks for the great responses everyone!"
"Let's talk about live sound","The Contortionist is the headliner, so they got a full sound check.  Revocation is the 2nd band, and probably got a check at least for dave.
Fallujah probably didn't have any.

Metal shows have never had good sound in smaller to medium venues, as most of the buildings are shit and unless the band has their own sound guy there's no guarantee in quality.  As for the bands, it's hard to know how the FOH mix sounds (being on stage changes a lot and wedges/monitors have a different mix than the audience) so it's out of their control."
"Let's talk about live sound","This is not entirely true. Yes the headliner gets a full sound check, after that you sorta lost it.

The opening band gets a sound check as well, they basically can check from the time the headliner finishes and doors opening. Everyone else just gets a line check before they play.

I would say the sound difference is probably in relation to a sound guy. The headliner is making the most money and can usually afford to bring someone they trust to get their sound right. Most other bands would just use the sound guy provided by the venue, sometimes they're great and sometimes they couldn't give a fuck less about how you sound."
"Let's talk about live sound","Well, at least that's my experience playing shows in Central OH, but I guess it's different in some places."
"Let's talk about live sound","That's peculiar, I've done shows in Ohio several times as well as numerous other places, and the schedule rarely deviates from the one I mentioned. However, I don't assume to know everything and the people you work with may run shit differently! Cheers."
"Let's talk about live sound","Well, my band is a psych band so there are some differences in the venues and stuff."
"Let's talk about live sound","Live sound is a tricky one because there's so many different scenarios and variables to consider. 

On stage your mix is completely different to what is coming out to the audience. You often have no idea how it sounds from the crowd. Often the person mixing the stage sound (monitors) is different to the guy mixing the crowd sound (front of house or FOH). The performers themselves have very little to do with the FOH sound.

As for individual acts; some bands tour with their own FOH engineers and monitor engineers. Some however dont and rely on the FOH engineer of one of the other bands on the bill or the venue's own FOH engineer.

In your scenario it's very likely that each band had a different FOH engineer and as such a different level of experience.

Things to keep in mind about FOH engineers. A bands FOH engineer will know their songs and the sound they want but not the room. Mixing to the room is important. Conversely the venue's FOH will likely not know the bands sound but know how to mix for the room as it is their home field so to speak.

Another big thing that has been discussed is soundchecks. Venues are a business and as such any time they're open, even if it's not to the public, costs money. A sound check may take an hour or more. Multiply that by a three band bill and suddenly you've got 3 hours of soundchecks to be doing not including the time it takes to load and unload all the gear from the stage in between. 

Venues don't like that.

Often the headlining act might get a full sound check where, in the age of digital FOH consoles, the engineer can save a preset of their mix to be loaded up come performance time. However the other bands may only get what I've always known as a 'levels check'. Which is basically setting the gain of each individual instrument/drum in which the FOH will then do a full mix during the first song. Bands hate it but it's a business thing.

Few other things to consider: 

* The guitar and bass amps on stage produce the sound but its often the microphones and the PA that is what properly amplifies it to the audience. If the bassist has his amp turned up too loud it's very possible that it can drown out the other elements. The FOH engineer can't physically turn down a bass amp that's on stage. 

* Axe FX/Kemper/Line 6 DI vs Real Amps. Not every band can afford/wants one. Sure lots of bands run these digital models through real cabs and a power amp but a lot don't either. Sound on stage often plays a large role on the sound off stage.

* Musical composition. As with studio recording, a song's composition and arrangement can often be the biggest cause of a shit mix.

* Triggers vs mics. You touched on this and it's certainly becoming a more prominent thing in live sound. Not only can you trigger kicks but also toms and even snare if you wanted to. A controlled sample is always going to sound more consistent and can make the engineers life a lot easier. But it may not sound as natural as the actual playing. 

* Listening position. The best place to be in a concert when it comes to sound is right at the FOH desk. Not only will you hear exactly what the engineer hears but any decent venue will have placed the FOH console there for a reason. It's often the best place acoustically in the room to listen. The worst place to be for good sound? The moshpit."
"Let's talk about live sound","Sound is beautiful. It's what really makes a show fantastic when used correctly, even if the musicians aren't great. 

It can also be a hinderance to the show. Some sound guys are of the mindset of, ""let's show off my system! Let's show them just how loud this baby can go!"" This is uncomfortable for everyone. They are detrimental to the concert. 

The sound guys who walk in with the mindset of, ""how can I make this sound amazing? How can I make this show better for everyone?"" Those are the guys you want. It makes the experiance about the performers, not the 18 inch subs. 


When I saw periphery in the summer slaughter tour (Worcester, near Boston if you're curious), everybody had the worst sound. Way too fucking loud. I think they even brought their own sound guys. They all had sound checks before the show. There was no excuse, if I was wearing custom -25db flat response earplugs and it was still too loud, just turn it down. So sad to have to leave early from a show like that. AAL show in Pittsburgh was the same way. Sound guy never turning down. "
"Let's talk about live sound","It's a pet hate of my own. I hate when I'm watching a gig and the sound guy is there watching the same show as me, and its so blatantly obvious that an instrument isn't coming out in the mix, and they don't do jack shit. I saw Alcest support Opeth back in November and I was pretty excited to see them, but you might as well have been listening to an instrumental band. Not only that but one of the guitars could have done with a bit of turning up as well. The very same thing happened when Cynic supported Opeth a few more years back. Incredibly underwhelmed. However, this is not an experience limited to Opeth gigs, it happens all of the time regardless of band, genre or venue. I know support bands generally get shafted when it comes to sound-checking before gigs, but when the show is actually going ahead, what is to stop the sound guy from turning up the vocals when you clearly can't hear them? I try to stand pretty central and near the sound guys so I can get the best sound most of the time so its not that I'm standing in a bad place."
"Let's talk about live sound","Just to throw even more inconsistency into the mix: I saw Fallujah in a shitty warehouse venue about four years ago, right before the Harvest Wombs came out, and they sounded near perfect. I still have dreams about that mix. I saw the Contortionist on the Parallax II tour in a very large venue that's been around for 15+ years and they sounded like a wet fart.  
  
In my experience, it really comes down to whether they've brought their own sound guy on tour and where you're standing in the venue. "
"Let's talk about live sound","Not to be a gramps but I can tell you when I saw contortionist open for periphery they completely pwned them simply by avoiding axe fx. Real amps are still important live."
"Let's talk about live sound","Real amps are still very important, especially in venues where the PA can't compensate for the lack of speaker cabinets. I see a ton of awesome newer bands jump immediately into amp modeling and play venues where they only mic the kick and vocals- It's an awful combination."

"Hey does anyone know what the periphery trilogy is about (referring to periphery the songs ""muramasa, ragnarok and masamune"")?","Before Alpha and omega is released I would really like to know what the trilogy is about since I've been listening to it for a while now and I've got no idea."
"Hey does anyone know what the periphery trilogy is about (referring to periphery the songs ""muramasa, ragnarok and masamune"")?","Well, Muramasa and Masamune are both legendary Japanese swords which appear often in Final Fantasy, which I know at least a few of the Periphery guys love. Ragnarok also appears as a end-game weapon occasionally and is of course, the norse end of the world, a theme which runs through the trilogy and is one of the main focus points. My interpretation applies the lyrics to the real world, then delves into the idea of the universe and shared consciousness. 

It has lots of similarities with FF-XIII-2, such as the last man, the universes demise, although I doubt that particular FF game was an inspiration. If any game was inspiration it would be FF7, which could make Ragnarok and possibly Masamune the end of the game told from Sephiroth's POV. Its most likely FF7 related or just a fantasy story with none of the parallels to our world, or any conclusions I've made, intended. That said, lyrics can have many interpretations so lets do this!

**Muramasa**

&gt; *Somewhere in time, we welcomed in the fall. 
But in the distance we can see, shining clear, our demise to be.*

Somewhere implies it doesn't matter *when* the world ends or which was the last fall we welcomed before it ended, only that it will end and we can see that *shining clear* even now. Also alludes to time being a man made concept which the universe (ie: we) would view as meaningless. This is repeated in all 3 songs.

The rest could be making a remark about current world issues and how the state of the world is seemingly getting worse, but we are only getting better at pretending everything is fine. Inequality, Global Warming *(Wake up! The water is rising now)*, Political Corruption, Corporate Power, Censorship ect

&gt; *You ask these questions in subconsciousness, but still we choose to deny the flood surrounding nations.*

This line points out that humanity already knows what should and can be done to prevent all these issues from worsening and yet still can't organise and make it happen. So we ignore the problem and just continue as normal. Vote in the next idiot. 

*""We're not listening to ourselves.""*

The flood metaphor also implies isolation between nations and between us all.

&gt; *We are the universe inside of you waiting patiently.*

This awesome line hints towards the idea of a collective consciousness, the idea that we all the same consciousness experiencing life through different perspectives. I have a body, but i am not my body, so what am i? Could my ""I"" be the same as your ""I"", only we are currently different people with different believes because of our experiences and environment? All things are made from the same fundamental building blocks that create matter and energy, after all. This higher power could be considered a concept of ""God"" which might explain the religious imagery used in both Ragnarok and Masamune.

&gt; They will not live to see the day.

Politicians? They don't care about what happens to the planet because of their actions, they will be dead before it affects them. This could apply to anyone being an asshole on a global scale. Or maybe humanity as a whole, suggesting we will never come together as a people while we are alive.

**Ragnarok**

First thing to point out is that the perspective has now changed from ""We"" to ""I"". The ""We"" from the previous song is the incomplete universal consciousness awaiting after death.

My idea is that the ""I"" from this song is the subconscious of what remains of humanity, or at least one person/aspect from it. This is the interpretation I'm going to go with, partly because the other song slightly supports this idea *(""You ask these questions in subconsciousness"")* but mostly because the other ones (man going crazy at end of world) is already well known amongst Periphery fans so i would rather explore other possibilities.

&gt; *Bloodshed on my mind.*

What remains of humanity (including the speaker) have become barbaric and violent at the worlds/universes coming collapse, which ""I"" sees through his bodies eyes. This could also refer to how the subconsciousness is anticipating death and thus, its own freedom.  

Concerning whether it is the earth or the universe dying (and how the last human is even alive at the end of the universe), my idea is that with no humans alive to perceive time as moving forward, the universes collapse could in a quantum-physics/schrodinger's cat kind of way happen immediately after the last human dies.

&gt; *Set me free* 

Fairly obvious, the consciousness wants to be fully released from the physical realm and our human bodies.

&gt; *A slave to these walls.* 

The walls meaning the mind, which literally makes these fragments of a greater consciousness its slave by controlling thought.

&gt; *Forty days and nights I've spent alone.
The shadow hungry angel inside of me grows cold.*

Religious imagery. 
Shadow = Death
Angel = Consciousness

It wants release from life.

&gt; *Grant a pardon for the meddling soul.*

Asking for forgiveness for the actions of humanity that've lead to the doomed state of the world, for which he feels guilty.

&gt; *Death has made its abode on my shoulders.
It clings to the palm of my hand eternally.
Within ascendance I shall relive the slaughtering.
You'll sing to the dirt, praying for the break of dawn.*

Humanity has a long history of death, which weighs heavily on us. We carry death's abode/home, which implies safety and comfort. Death is comfortable around humanity. Implying our destiny of death isn't a bad thing. 
We shall ascend, but then also relive our gruesome history, the entirety of every single persons life simultaneously and/or eternally. ""You"" is the rest of humanity who are still yet to ascend, suffering on earth. The break of dawn is most likely the end of the world (since the fall and midnight are both before the end and the end is shining bright)

&gt; *Night will bring the presence of a ravenous demon setting out to terrify.*

The end of the world will create people who do horrific things.

&gt; *Scale the insight, for the day it lies before us.
Somewhere in time...*

Insight into the universe scales with your ability to experience it. What lies before us is universal knowledge, including the collective understanding and ability to save the world which we have nearly destroyed. But in scale of the universe, those problems were insignificant.

**Masamune**

&gt; *As I slip away... thoughts rushing through me. Angelic call?
Or a demon that's calling my name?*

Finally, the mind is letting go of the body. More religious imagery.

&gt; *Enter the intrepid state. Enter beyond what is seen to the spiritual stream of the vacant.*

Fearless as we are now one with the universe and each other. Thus ""I"" being used again, because we are for the first time since humanity began, one single entity.

&gt; *The course of ancient power, it will follow.
Fall with me.*

This could be referring to the fall that is welcomed in muramasa, meaning the fall that is welcomed when humanity dies (ie: falls) and becomes one.

&gt; *Dark and grim for a memory.
Measuring all the glory as it seemed.
Was it enough for eternity?*

This is us looking back at our past, wondering if it was worth it to transcend and become whatever ethereal being we are now.

&gt; *Foolish schemes for a destiny lined with dreams all came crashing down on me.
What will become of the energy?*

Contemplating how we foolish humans were planning their future with dreams, not realising the eternal ""life"" that awaits when everyone is dead. It also adds to the scale the insight line from before and how small our human problems were. We are now the energy, universal and self conscious wondering what is next in store.

&gt; *Salvation is so far from unholy realms of the filth infestation.
Torture the life death-bound in wretched ways.
Repent or revenge?*

Humanity was the filth infestation, which has now become Salvation. Yet seeing all the injustice throughout humanities short history, it collectively wonders whether it deserves repentance or revenge against it for inflicting so much suffering.

&gt; *There's no pardon for a meddling soul.
Somewhere in time we welcomed in the fall, now in the distance I can see shining, clear, our demise to be...
We're not listening to ourselves.*

The song ends where the trilogy began, suggesting this cycle repeats eternally. The soul receives no pardon, meaning it must eventually return to the physical, after the creation of a new universe and suffer once more in the hope that, this time, it will listen to its deep subconscious instincts of one-ness with the universe and after the next ascension, will be able to look back upon its many lives and be proud.

I'd just like to make it clear that I mostly just pulled this from my ass and i know its very unlikely that this is what the band were thinking when writing these lyrics, but let me know what you think anyway!"

The songwriting is good, the guitar work is absolutelu stellar, and the way the songs are mixed is masterful, I just can't take my self seriously by listening to a band that does these kinds of things.

Protest the Hero is absolutely goofy in their music but it feels a little more part of their own character instead of this put-up persona. There's just something about putting item names of a game in your title that feels a little more cringy than anything else I have seen in progbands. Again, this is part of personal taste, and apparently most are completely fine with it.

Bands that don't present themselves seriously – especially when they might actually be talented musicians – do themselves and their fans a serious disservice. 

Note I don't mean you can never have any fun. I mean Mastodon's an example of a band who've pretty well balanced goofy craziness with talented execution. But the tidal wave of silliness that came in with 2000s metalcore and djent is too far. "

The biggest lyrical motif is...

*Somewhere in time, we welcomed in the fall. 
But in the distance we can see shining clear our demise to be. 
We're not listening to ourselves.*

I've interpreted this as humanity not changing/adjusting to something that inevitably will bring all of humankind down. This is most likely some sort of demon invasion as hinted at throughout Ranganok. Of course... it seems our main character ends up failing in his task as that there is ""no pardon for a meddling soul"". The big change in the main lyrical motif happens at the end of Masamune.

*Somewhere in time we welcomed in the fall, 
Now in the distance I can see shining clear our demise to be.
We're not listening to ourselves.*

The change to the words ""Now"" and ""I"" is significant. Whatever needed to change in the world didn't end up happening. The end of humanity has come. The main character is the only person left alive and is looking at the face of destruction, sword in hand. Commence heavy crazy riffage as the end comes."

Okay, so I am a huge Meshuggah fan! They are my favorite band. Hell, I am currently wearing a Meshuggah beanie that I bought at one of their concerts. I also love bands like Mastodon, Gojira, Tool and Between the Buried and Me and that sort of thing. Well, recently I came across this band through YouTube's related videos and I know they're not super heavy like Meshuggah, but I have listened to this album like every day for the past week. It has really grown on me! The vocalist is a little strange and it might take a while to get used to him, but they are just so talented. My favorite song is the last one on this EP titled, ""Crystallised."" There's like this Acapella part in that song that you might think is a little weird at first, which I understand, cuz it threw me off. lol But just give them a chance. The part at 27:14 is what makes the whole song so damn good, in my opinion! Tell me what you guys think..."

"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Nah, I've been listening to all of their stuff, don't worry. Honestly, though, ""Crystallised"" is still my favorite song right now. "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Celestial Elixir is one of my personal favorites.  It's got such a big epic sound and has some of the most memorable little hooks and jingles. "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","You are preaching to the choir man. I'm pretty sure everyone here on progmetal loves Haken :) 

You should check Dream Theater in case you haven't, they are like Haken's fathers."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Yeah, I can see that now! :) Haha I just subscribed a few hours ago and didn't see any posts about Haken, so I figured I'd give it a shot just in case they weren't getting the appreciation they deserve."

"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I actually like Haken better"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","O yea, me too. But Haken is really similar to DT, they borrowed a lot of things and improved :) That's what i meant."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Haken is my favorite band! You should check out all of their other albums.  All of them are that good.  Personally my favorite songs by them are Falling Back to Earth and Streams, but that is constantly in flux."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Yeah, I have listened to ""The Mountain"" and ""Visions"" all the way through, but not as much as I have with ""Restoration."" I'm gonna check out those two songs right now! :) "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Haken is a band where there is no wrong answer when somebody asks what your favorite song is."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","So I listened to those two songs. As soon as I played ""Falling Back to Earth,"" I recognized it. I love that damn song... However, I think that was the first time I really heard ""Streams."" I really like it, too! I know what you mean, though, about there being no wrong answer. I have listened to all of their music and there isn't one song that I don't love! "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","You really should listen to Aquarius, their first album. Its probably my favorite and is much more prog metal than say The Mountain or Restoration which I feel is much more prog rock.

They can't do wrong though, I don't think there is a single piece of music they've written that I dislike."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I listened to it all yesterday and I definitely see why you love it. I'm listening again right now. It's fucking awesome, man. :)"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I'm glad you liked it :)"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Yeah, I'll check that out as soon as I can."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Aquarius is my favorite. It tells a story about a mermaid, sort of. It's very musically interesting/wonderful, imo. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKkycq9Suok)"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Yup. Listening right now. Love it!!!"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Listen for the story! It took me a few listens to figure out there was a story and a handful more to piece it together. It's my favorite album for now."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I'll listen while reading the lyrics when I get back home. I love concept albums. "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Upvote for Streams!"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Yep, we love it :-)


I really haven't stopped listening to it since it came out, so much to absorb and it just keeps on giving haha. Haken is quickly rising to the top of my favorite bands list with their consistently solid albums that take awesome new directions.

Anyways, glad you gave them a shot! Definitely check out their previous albums, starting with The Mountain, then working back to Visions and Aquarius."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","&gt; Haken is quickly rising to the top of my favorite bands list with their consistently solid albums that take awesome new directions.

In the past month, I bought all their albums and I've been pretty much listening to nothing else (besides the new BG album).

The only thing I have to say is this: it's a shame there's only 3 full-length albums (although one could say Restoration is close enough to a fourth).  Nocturnal Conspiracy is probably my favorite track overall - the first ~5 minutes should be illegal."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I don't even count restoration as an ep. Rush has albums that are basically the same length, I think hemispheres is only 34 minutes long."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","very close, 36 minutes."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Yeah they have risen to the top of my list of favorite bands within a week, which is faster than just about any other band ever has! :) "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Recently discovered them too! And I fell in love.
I absolutely love that every member of this band sings. The Acappella part of ""Because it's There"" off ""The Mountain"", blows my mind.
  "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Haken blew my mind within the very first moments of hearing ""Premonition"" for the first time back in 2011. They definitely have that quality of rapidly growing on people, moreso than any other band I can think of!"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","That was basically my experience.  I think I actually had just come across /r/progmetal at the time and discovered them here at work.  Fired up Visions in the car one night while travelling and I basically lost my mind after hearing Premonition and Nocturnal Conspiracy played in order.  I didn't even know what to do.  I called my friend and said ""I'll be in the area in about an hour.  We're going on a ride when I get there.  Be ready you gotta hear this"". "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","You can say that again! I didn't hear this band until about a week ago. I saw ""Restoration"" in a related video, clicked on it and immediately, within the first few seconds of listening to this EP, fell in love with this band!"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Love Haken! Welcome to the club. When I first discovered Visions I must have listened to it over and over again for a few months. Maybe 40 plays.  Haven't done that with anybody else except maybe Animals as Leaders and their most recent album.  Love that."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I can't wait until Haken releases a new album!!! :D "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Give it a year man. It feels like they've consistently delivered new albums since I think 2010. So that's four so far, i honestly can't wait for the next one, hopefully keeping up with the one a year trend. Their music is so perfect, I found them and April with ""The Mountain,"" and I haven't looked back since. Just waiting for a Tour of America now haha"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Yeah! Now that would be one hell of a show to see! "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Haken is currently the darling of the prog world, so don't worry we've given them a chance.

And yeah, this EP was 3rd on my albums of the year in 2014. It beat out many full-length albums. Haken is so remarkably consistent."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Out of curiosity, what were numbers 1 and 2? :)"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","This is my 2014 top ten :)

1. Anathema - Distant Satellites
2. Mastodon - Once More 'Round the Sun
3. Haken - Restoration EP
4. Intervals - A Voice Within
5. Devin Townsend - Casualties of Cool
6. Umphrey's McGee - Similar Skin
7. Opeth - Pale Communion
8. IQ - The Road of Bones
9. Animals as Leaders - The Joy of Motion
10. Phish - Fuego

It was a weird year..."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Listening to Distant Satellites right now. Thanks, man!"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","What did you think?"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","If you're asking what I thought about Distant Satellites, I liked it but I wouldn't say it's the best album of 2014. Then again, I'm not really sure what I'd say my top 10 of 2014 is. I'll get back to you on that. There's a lot of albums I still need to listen to. Restoration and Pale Communion would definitely be up there, though. "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Cool cool. It wasn't a runaway for me, it was a pretty close top 4. It had the advantage of coming out earlier in the year, which probably accounted for how high it placed. You should check out Weather Systems from them as well. That album is a masterpiece"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Yeah thanks, man. I'll do that. "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Also, I've listened to ""Pale Communion"" quite a bit in the past few weeks. I really love that album. It's soooo much better than ""Heritage,"" in my opinion. "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Agreed. Pale Communion has the groovyness that Heritage was seeking but ultimately lacking. It also has more stand-out tracks than Heritage."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Yes, my thoughts exactly."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Am I the only one who just really can't seem to like their singer? I've tried so hard. They are stellar musicians but I just don't think Ross is the best fit for these guys. Just my opinion."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","On a technical level he's kinda meh, but I think he fits in with Haken really well. He's got a nice understated style that balances out the crazy instrumental stuff. Plus in a genre with a lot of generic vocalists, he's refreshingly different. Of course it's all opinion, and even I sometimes wish I could hear some crazy soaring vocals in their songs, but I can't really imagine Haken with anyone else."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I agree, I think he has a nice style that fits in with heavier and softer moments very well. I'd love to hear someone like Russell Allen sing in Haken's music with crazy soaring melodies but not everyone can be a Russell Allen and honestly, Haken doesn't really need a Russell Allen."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","&gt; On a technical level he's kinda meh, but I think he fits in with Haken really well. He's got a nice understated style that balances out the crazy instrumental stuff. Plus in a genre with a lot of generic vocalists, he's refreshingly different.

I think this has been said a lot about Dream Theater.  Everyone acknowledges what people have to say about Labrie, but he's just part of the music and if you love DT you love Labrie.  Same goes for Haken I think.  "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","You think James LaBrie is technically meh? Have you heard songs like Learning to Live? Because that is far from meh. He's had his issues with lacking vocal power live in the 2000s, but he's hardly understated."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I just think he's a love it or hate it kinda singer for a lot of people.  People tend to say that sort of stuff about him in my experience.  I personally love his work from the early to the recent and have nothing bad to say about him. "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I can't say I enjoy him as much as I just sort of accept him.  He enunciates things strangely or something, and occasionally almost sounds like he has a country-music-singer accent of all things.  But it's not overt enough for it to be a problem I guess.

EDIT: Also his upper-register doesn't have much power behind it."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I had trouble getting into him at first, but I really like him in The Mountain and the new EP. Cockroach King and Because It's There are great. I still think he's not as great in Visions(Insomnia is really good), but still a vocalist that I've come to like more over the last couple years."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I can see why you think that and I respect your opinion, but I have to disagree. I think his vocals are a perfect fit for the music. It's weird, too, because most of the time, when I find a new progressive rock band, I say the same thing - I don't like the vocals, but the music is good. This band is different for some reason. Everything works together just right in my opinion. "
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I should rephrase. He's not a bad singer by any means and I do like a lot of their stuff with the vocals. Just a few occasional moments that make me go ""meh"""
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","haha well, I'm not gonna tell you you're wrong for thinking that. Are you talking about a part in this EP or a different album?"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","My only issue is his live sound. He doesn't have the range that comes out on the records, so certain passages sound horrible when he tries to sing them live. Whatever though, on the album, Ross is my shit. 

People say that about James LaBrie, but he grew on me, and is one of my favorite vocalists."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I agree with you exactly. I thought the same thing too about Crystalized being an amazing song but I had already thought everyone on this subreddit would have known that by now."
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","Holy fuck that is beautiful"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I know right?!"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","I really want to get into Haken. But I just can't get around to actually listening to them :D  
I still have no idea how they sound. Just that I will most likely enjoy them"
"Haken | Restoration (Full EP 2014)","You definitely will. All of their music is amazing. "

I had posted Gutter Moon a bit back, didn't catch on, hope the album gets a bit of attention. I was surprised that they released it for free, really is a great product with a unique sound, as you said. 

Fascinating guitar and bass tones, they sound like they could almost be synths (and I know there's synths for reinforcement), but it's just so thick and crunchy. Bass sounds a bit like Karnivool, that awesome fuzziness to it. Huge mix overall, getting that wall of sound going strong.

After a couple listens, [Owls is probably my favorite for now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ltBx5svW8k), but haven't really delved into it much, so that'll probably change.

Only complaint so far is that a lot of the songs seem very similar structured, about a minute instrumental intro, 1st verse with slightly thinner instrumental texture or just the bass line for accompaniment, thick verses with additional synths. Gives it a bit of same-y feeling, but once I've spun it a couple more times I'll see if they feel more distinct."

"Tony MacAlpine - Tears Of Sahara","I discovered him when he was touring with Steve Vai.
Great guitarist!"
"Tony MacAlpine - Tears Of Sahara","I discovered him when I discovered Planet X. He has an incredible chemistry with Sherinian and Donati.  Absolutely brilliant band."
"Tony MacAlpine - Tears Of Sahara","George Lynch does a solo on that song. I loved this album when it came out, haven't listened to it since. Thanks for reminding me!"
"Tony MacAlpine - Tears Of Sahara","Wow, great one. Haven't heard it in years. 

I was always surprised he got less attention than Satriani."

"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","This song gives me chills for 13 minutes straight. I always forget that's even possible until I listen to this song again. Especially that recapitulation at 9:23. UGH. I can't even handle the amount of epic. "
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","I obviously agree 100%."
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Yeah, this was the perfect one for long jogs. Maybe the most extravagant Mastodon song ever. Always dug the operatic vocal keyboards and the down and dirty metal section in...maybe 10/16? ""Cyanide he craves"" section..."
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Funny you should mention that as this accompanied me on part of my 3 mile jog today. Running never felt so trippy haha. And yeah, definitely either 10/16 or 10/8 there, grouped as 3+3+2+2."
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Haha I had no idea what riff you guys were talking about till the 3+3+2+2. What is a recapitulation? "
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","In its most simple terms it means a musical theme that is revisited. 


Going a little more in depth for the sake of of providing a TIL, a recapitulation is the third movement of a piece written in sonata form. Sonata form was first developed during the Classical/Romantic music time periods through composers like Mozart/Beethoven/Schubert etc but still persists today through many mediums of music. 

Sonata form consists of 3 main movements, or in the case of The Last Baron, sections. The 1st movement (0:00-3:15) being the exposition, much like a story, where the main theme and key (tonal center) of the piece is presented. The exposition also normally includes brief musical hints of what's to come in the 2nd movement/section of the piece (3:15-9:25) which is called the development. This is where key changes may occur and the main theme diverges into and expands upon different musical ideas. The 3rd movement is the recapitulation (9:25-11:15) where the song returns to the first melody/theme and back to the initial tonal center. Sonata form can also include what are known as codas, which can be thought of as a sort of outro, which The Last Baron does from around the 11:15 minute mark to the end.


Recapitulation. :) "

"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Exactly!  Set up my playlist for a half marathon the year this came out so that this song would carry me to the finish.  Such a great jam."
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Way off-topic, but are people generally pretty cool with you wearing headphones in marathons?

"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Yeah, no that's definitely not my intention. I don't even understand the whole comment/link karma grabbing nonsense.

I'd never intentionally try and bury other links for virtual internet points haha"
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Well you won't find any better metal discussion on reddit than in here. I don't think that people that just post Protest The Hero/Periphery/Dream Theater all the time are deliberately trying to hide posts, it's just that they don't care if other posts get buried. Unfortunately this makes it difficult to post bands that don't get talked about much on here, people only want to upvote the bands they've already heard."
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Nope, I won't. :) I've discovered that over the past few months. And it's not just because I have a penchant for progressive music either. The discussions here are always really civil, lighthearted but intelligent when need be. Just what I've been itching for.

"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Right! There's no other adjective I can think of to better describe this. It fits perfectly. And now that I am aware of the Hall of Fame it looks like Blackest Eyes by Porcupine Tree did not get deleted so I'm hoping this is allowed to survive for discourse sake, but it's fine if it's not as I'm sure all my kindred spirits on here already know and love this tune. "
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Absolutely! Only one that compares for me is Hearts Alive which I'd have to say is my say is my favorite song because it represents everything I love about the band"
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Hearts Alive is the sludgiest of sludge. Like the from scratch hot chocolate I tried to make the other night that I simmered way too long and ended up struggling to sip on a drink with pudding-esque consistency. "
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Still though, this one wins out for me, if only because of the transitions and diversity of sound. I still, to this day, struggle to figure out the time signatures between the 6 minute mark and 6:20. Love that little dose of crazy! "
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Killer end to a killer album. "

"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","I remember seeing Mastodon on the tour they did after this album in 2010. They played the entire album straight through and they had this trippy movie on a screen at the back of the stage that went with the story/lyrics. Hearing this song live was like an out of body experience."
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","If you want to relive that night, get their Live At the Aragon album. It's a recording of their Chicago performance of that tour, and it comes with a DVD of the concert. "
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","I actually have that album. They did a really good job of recording that show."
"Mastodon- The Last Baron. ""I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze...""","Totally. They even had a keyboard player to do all those parts. They were at the top of their game too, seen them twice more since then and it just wasn't the same."

"Periphery - Buttersnips","Personally one their best songs from their repertoire, thoughts?"
"Periphery - Buttersnips","Easily one of their best! I'm sad they're straying so much from their original sound, but I guess you can't be upset with progression from a progressive metal band.."
"Periphery - Buttersnips","Tell that to Opeth fans."
"Periphery - Buttersnips","True..but even as an Opeth fan myself who doesn't like their new material as much I can't expect them to pop out death metal records for the rest of their lifetime. I appreciate the direction they're going in, but it's not my favourite. Same goes with Periphery"
"Periphery - Buttersnips","I'm just glad they're playing old heavy material live again, I'm happy for them to evolve in the direction they want if they'll do a little fan service live."
"Periphery - Buttersnips","With you there, I commend them a lot for exploring new ground but at the same time I'm very disappointed at the fact that there will never be an album like P1 again. New bands won't even come close to that."
"Periphery - Buttersnips","To me, the new songs have made me think the equation for the new album is P1+P2=P3. The P1 sound is also Misha, not 'Periphery' as they are now, so it was to be expected. Still lots of classic Misha goodness in the new songs so far though. 22 Faces, Bad Thing, Graveless... They all sound dope imo"
"Periphery - Buttersnips","I agree. I'm a P2 person, but I still enjoy P1 and the new stuff immensely."
"Periphery - Buttersnips","Yup. Awesome song. Love the clean tapping section in the middle with the groovy drum beats."
"Periphery - Buttersnips","It's very satisfying to play on guitar too!"
"Periphery - Buttersnips","Haha yes it is! Really cool tapping riff/lick"

"Kamelot - Elizabeth I-III. I don't see Kamelot posted here often, but they definitely have their prog moments, and here's 12 of them.","This is correct, Epica is the first half of the Faust story, and The Black Halo is the conclusion."

Probably due to never really considering it as well as well as the fact that my first exposure to them was definitely more of the power-oriented tracks. First impressions and all that.

This shouldn't tell against the fantastic music they create, just that I haven't personally heard it yet (which probably suggests that they are particularly progressive and I'm just daft)."
"Kamelot - Elizabeth I-III. I don't see Kamelot posted here often, but they definitely have their prog moments, and here's 12 of them.","They aren't particularly progressive, but they have their moments. My favorite is [Memento Mori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnYW1xeixAE)."

"Kamelot - Elizabeth I-III. I don't see Kamelot posted here often, but they definitely have their prog moments, and here's 12 of them.","I'd definitely say they are a power metal band over a progressive band too.

Definitely mostly power though. "
"Kamelot - Elizabeth I-III. I don't see Kamelot posted here often, but they definitely have their prog moments, and here's 12 of them.","I think it's just safest to say that bands are much more complex than our seemingly well-defined genres would suggest.

"The Heisenprog Uncertainty Principle?","It seems that we've had a lot of discussion lately about what's prog/progressive, what elements certain bands have, and even about what's metal and what isn't. Maybe we should start talking about these really close examinations always fall apart under this tight of scrutiny. Thoughts?"
"The Heisenprog Uncertainty Principle?","I think the reason that we see so many arguments about what prog is/isn't it that it's never been properly defined. When the genre started back in the 70's it wasn't called prog, it was just a bunch of bands writing music that might have shared some similar traits and were retroactively labelled ""prog"". 

Then for 20 - 30 years prog essentially had no widespread media presence that could disseminate a solid definition of the genre, so isolated communities formed, each with their own ideas about what ideas were progressive or not. The internet did wonders for connecting people with bands in the style, but there are still some pretty isolated communities with their strict definitions on the genre. The Progarchives community has a vastly different standards for prog than RateYourMusic, which has different ideas than here, etc. 

Then there's just the confusing label the genre has anyway. Is it music that's consistently progressing from the most recent trend? Or is it based on the characteristics that the OG bands like King Crimson, Yes, Jethro Tull, etc had? Why take the ""progressive"" part literally but not the ""rock"" part? Would a field recording of boulders being smashed together in 11/8 for 30 minutes be the epitome of prog rock?

The arguments about metal just confuse me, particularly the ""metalcore is not metal"" debates. I'm not denying a punk influence there, but when I listen to Between the Buried and Me I think more of Dream Theater or other metal groups than The Clash. Plus there's the whole ""purity of the genre"" thing people blather on about, as if thrash wasn't the first time punk and metal crossed over.

That's my really wordy, anecdotal two cents."
"The Heisenprog Uncertainty Principle?","That's really cool lol. A periodic table for metal bands . I like the idea! Each group would mean a different genre of metal . But damn, this would require a lot of fucking planning and time . But I think we can do it."

"Advice for someone struggling with composition?","Hey guys, this is by far my favorite reddit community and I figured some of the composers and/or music consumers here might have some advice. I'm in the process of writing my very first concept album and so far it has been kind of a nightmare. I have my concept identified and have even wrote out a narrative of the story with characters, etc. I don't really have a problem coming up with riffs, but I'm struggling with piecing the music together to make a cohesive ""unit."" Things don't seem to fit together and it blows. I truly realize you can't rush this process, but I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels. I would be eternally grateful for any advice. Thanks guys.

UPDATE: just a little snippet. [Soundcloud link](https://soundcloud.com/gavin-clark/jazzmetal-run)"
"Advice for someone struggling with composition?","Hey dude! As somebody who has written a concept album, a concept EP, and is nearly done a second concept album, I might be able to offer some good advice. Melodic or rhythmic themes with variations on harmony and instrumentation that can  be repeated throughout is a very useful tool. Subtle repetition is what makes concept albums memorable. Don't be afraid to do some weird things with harmony at the end of a song to make sure that it flows into the key of the next one. Using synth pads or ambient guitar tones is helpful for getting certain songs to flow into one another. Good luck, man!"
"Advice for someone struggling with composition?","As somebody who has written a concept trilogy, four other concept albums, three more non-concept albums, and is currently working on a tenth album that contains one concept epic, I agree with this guy and will also try to throw some other advice at you. 

* Unless you're specifically going for the ""this album is really one song broken into movements"" approach, don't feel obligated to force smooth transitions. There's nothing wrong with letting a song finish and starting another one somewhere else if it feels better. 
* I tend to do a lot of my music writing away from any instruments – on notebooks in school or at work, or on the back of church bulletins. I recognize my limitations as a guitarist, so I know I have to sometimes come up with ideas with my mind rather than my fingers.
* Listen to music that's outside your typical fare. Classical, jazz, and old prog rock are awesome for getting the juices flowing. 
* With my first concept album, I wrote all the lyrics first, and improvised the entire album just being influenced by them. (I miss being able to do that...) So maybe just record yourself improvising while reading your lyrics, and listen back to see if you came up with any riffs or sections you really like. 

Hope some of this helps. Looking forward to hearing your album!"
"Advice for someone struggling with composition?","Interesting. I guess now that I think of it, lots of my favorite concept albums don't necessarily have smooth transitions between movements. That was a goal of mine but you're right, I don't think its something that needs to be forced. I wish I was on the level where I could write music away from my instruments. One thing I am able to do, however, is whistle out ideas for melodies/riffs. I have about 1000 recordings on my iPhone of spontaneous ideas that pop into my head! I should get into the practice of physically writing on a notebook though.

For me, classical, jazz, and old prog are part of my typical fare. I do, however, think I would benefit from listening to some pop, electronic, alternative stuff. Thanks for the ideas dude!"
"Advice for someone struggling with composition?","Thank you! I think I just need a little more patience and need to stop being hard on myself. I agree with you about subtle repetition, but I seem to struggle with the ""subtle"" part, haha. Appreciate your advice man"
"Advice for someone struggling with composition?","Do you mean piecing a song together from the riffs or making your songs flow from one another?"
"Advice for someone struggling with composition?","I guess I meant piecing a song together from riffs. I have lots of riffs, and I could transpose them to make them all in a key that works together, but they still never ""feel"" like they belong together. Its like I'm forcing them together for the sake of making a song. I need a new approach."
"Advice for someone struggling with composition?","I'm currently working on my own concept album with a comic series so I usually try and use visuals or what is literally happening to create a song. For example, I have a song where the main character is pacing back and forth in his apartment so I wrote a riff that runs up four notes and back down. That gets repeated throughout my verses as the character voices is monologue in the lyrics. 

I find that writing riffs beforehand without a clear intention makes it really difficult to combine them. I know that the riff is good but if that piece can't smoothly transition into the next, then I'll end up hating the rest of the song no matter how good the next riffs are. "
"Advice for someone struggling with composition?","There's not really a secret to doing this, but transitions really are everything. I think it's a good idea to listen to the bands you like to see how they do it and try to imitate that until you find your own original way of doing it. Different bands have different approaches and it'd be a good idea to play around with different ideas to find one that works for you. I suggest listening to bands who use extended Song forms a lot such as Opeth, Between the Buried and Me, and Dream Theater. Pay close to attention to how these bands move from section to section. They all have a distinct way of doing it. Try implementing these ideas into your own writing to help piece together your ideas. 

Dream Theater in particular is a good one to listen to because Mike Portnoy's role in the band was to do exactly this and it shows in the band's last two albums. While the music is fine, if you pay attention to the structures of the music you'll notice a lot of jarring transitions and a bit of a struggle to piece together songs. It's not as smooth as in the past. Study the transitions found in I&amp;W and compare those to the ones in ADTOE. Not only will this highlight the importance of arrangement, but it will also give you some good ideas hopefully.

Hope this helps! "
"Advice for someone struggling with composition?","Thanks for the input. You've kind of made me have an epiphany, as well. I couldn't quite figure out why the new DT albums sort of sucked, but I think you hit the nail on the head. It was totally about the transitions. It always was. I don't know why I couldn't see that. But you're 100% right"
"Advice for someone struggling with composition?","Yea, I didn't care for ADTOE much and while I really liked DT12, the major flaw on both of those albums are the transitions.

Check out how Opeth does it. Off the top of my head I'd say they're the best at doing this, especially if you're making riff driven music. Every single transition they do is seamless. "
"Advice for someone struggling with composition?","Everyone's compositional approach is different, but I'll share mine.  I'm not formally trained or educated in theory, but I try to use it to some extent.  Otherwise, my music sounds unpleasantly random.

If you're like me... I can chug out music that goes together in a key / scalar sense all day.  But it often does not sound good or interesting overall.  The next step is to think about melodic motifs and patterns to build music around.  

For example, I usually write rhythmic riffs with some kind of chord progression in mind, even if it's not truly chordal.  Then, when you go to write leads and melodies, think about the key notes of the chords you are basing the rhythm on and try to emphasize those in your playing.  For me, I'll really in a jazz phase so I make heavy use of 3rds and 7ths (often manifested by starting / ending a phrase or applying rhythmic emphasis on these notes).

If you're into music theory, read up on voice leading in a jazz context.  A classic example is moving the 7th of one chord to a key position (such as 1st, 3rd, or 5th) of the next chord in the progression.  I believe the standard 2-5-1 progression works this way.

And given that the new Periphery album is really topical, check out some of the [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2thywk/juggernaut_recurring_themes_compilation_video/) analyzing motifs and repetition.  This is a good example of use of motifs in a concept album context.

Finally, an excellent band you might enjoy that creates great songs from simple melodic motifs is [Special Provicence](http://specialprovidence.bandcamp.com/).  Songs like K2 have a relatively straightforward melodic pattern that they play with and create a whole song around (that I find awesome, at least).  And if you watch them live, they improvise the solos around that pattern, demonstrating true mastery."
"Advice for someone struggling with composition?","First of all, thank you for recommending Special Provicence. Holy cow, love that first track (Babel Confusion). So cool. 

I actually just purchased Mark Levine's *The Jazz Theory Book* and I understand it is sort of the golden standard among jazz students. Looking forward to working through that and learning more. I wasn't a music student in college, but I have a basic to intermediate understanding of theory. 

I find that I'll come up with the riff/melody idea first before coming up with a chord progression. I've found that if I come up with a chord progression first, I feel kind of restrained and that I'm obligated to create a melody that works within that progression. I want to break free of that mindset. Thank you for your thoughtful response, I'll definitely continue to learn as much as I can about jazz.

**EDIT**: I want to include this little quote from the aforementioned book: ""A great jazz solo consist of 1% magic, and 99% stuff that is explainable, analyzable, categorizable, and doable. This book is about the 99% stuff."""

"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","Man that's so fucking weird.. I'm listening to Autorun now and I was about to post about The Algorithm.  Crazy coincidence.  "
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","Wow. That was incredible."
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","The Algorithm is pretty great! Glad you enjoyed!"
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","Head over to /r/IDM and start checking some stuff out. Plenty of those guys draw on elements commonly found in prog metal, or are directly inspired by metal . I'm getting into it more and more myself, but my introduction was The Flashbulb. His old stuff (like 2005ish and before) as well as Hardscrabble is pretty awesome stuff. His new stuff is also awesome, though quite a bit different. "
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","What is IDM exactly?"
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","It stands for Intelligent Dance Music. It's still EDM, but I've found that a lot of electronic styles/artists that I like can be found under this category, either on /r/IDM or via Google. It was a helpful starting point when I was trying to dive further into electronic music myself. Plus it seems to me that 'IDM artists' are much more metal in general haha. "
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","Definetely check out BT - This Binary Universe [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve8WaGmyhfI&amp;list=PLA9E61F998DAFF2C0)

Doesn't have heavy guitars or what not, but it's one piece of music that tells a story. It features live orchestration and glitch elements. It's instrumental goodness that creates it's own world for the listener."
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","If you like some of the more jazz influences in prog/fusion, check out Squarepusher, particularly the earlier albums."
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","I'd need to have my music collection at hand, but check out the song  Tabris by Reso.

Also, i guess a little played at this stage, but check out the first skirllex album. Heavy as fuck and has complexity that'll keep you interested for a month or so.

Check out prodigy - start with the song invaders must die, then explore that album if you like a bit of that..

Cehck out Pendulum - start wit the song the island part 2,
""Plasticworld"" (featuring Fats and TC) 	6:21
""Hold Your Colour""   	5:28
""Streamline""  

Don't know if it's what your into, but it's stuff that makes me groove"
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","I will check that out! Thanks for the reply!"
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","&gt; Hold Your Colour

The most progressive Pendulum song is 18 Pendulum songs at the same time! ;D

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g61brCepGVE"
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","Haha make that 19! Had pendulum on in the back ground..  Who even thinks of that "
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","What kind of prog do you like? I wouldn't recommend the same EDM to someone who likes Meshuggah as opposed to, say, Dream Theatre."
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","I like both of them actually. But a little bit towards Dream Theater. Periphery is a good example of band i like that has nice EDM elements, i was looking for something like that."
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","Well, for the aggressive side I think you'd like electro house. Knife Party's new album Abandon Ship is a good example of this.

On the other hand, if you want something somewhat light and airy, I'd recommend some progressive trance/house like [BT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doedi2MI-iM), [Tiesto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPfUzoFDIC0), [Deadmau5] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKi9Z-f6qX4), and Above and Beyond (haven't listened to enough to give you a good song recommendation).

Periphery has also named [Telefon Tel Aviv] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYnmP8HOZ00) and Trifonic as influences to their electronic side, [The Flashbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iry-JfsJN6g) is along the same lines too."
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","Thanks a lot!!"
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","Take a look at [Dark Model](https://www.youtube.com/user/ModelElectronic)"
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","Try [Infected Mushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNte4dTMwe4)! They're the ones that got me interested in electronic music! (along with Pendulum, but they've already been mentioned)

Their earlier trance stuff is probably more ""proggy,"" but their [newer material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uLK4hDJC84) is just as cool imo."
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","If you want a more ""strictly"" EDM record (as opposed to more rock inspired stuff like Pendulum and Infected Mushroom) that has a lot of variety in pace, try [this jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdUjFxqN9QQ&amp;list=PLCsokAw0UtmiPuELOr8JZmOTQeIaX4sVT).

Maybe not the most accessible from a metal background, but really good if you want something different.

Edit: two more thoughts I had, [Skrillex - Recess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1qgY7GN1tY) is super agro and a ton of variety and just really good.  Another with a lot of variety and a little more chill is [SBTRKT's self-titled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1eRWKPM3HI&amp;list=PLf6tiIPq88T5o2LLNlHVBVmbpvsOyQMIU)."
"Anyone know any EDM music with prog elements?","I don't know if this really fits the EDM label, but Kashiwa Daisuke makes dope dreamscape, progressive ass electronic music.

"Job For A Cowboy - The Stone Cross. Gotta say I love JFAC's attempt at Tech Death/Prog Death, this album is awesome.","Haha, I know how you feel. I remember JFAC when they were just another deathcore band, now they're making awesome metal. Can't complain there!"
"Job For A Cowboy - The Stone Cross. Gotta say I love JFAC's attempt at Tech Death/Prog Death, this album is awesome.","Same! I'm happy to see they're experimenting. Is that a fretless bass? Very Steve DiGiorgio."
"Job For A Cowboy - The Stone Cross. Gotta say I love JFAC's attempt at Tech Death/Prog Death, this album is awesome.","It sounds like it's a fretted bass, but he's totally playing it as if it were a fretless one.  I kind of like the tone he's getting out of it; the transition between notes is just the slightest bit jarring rather than smooth on the fretless.  His playing is competent so the sound stays intact as he straight dances around the fretboard.  Most intriguing metal bass of 2014 that's for sure."
"Job For A Cowboy - The Stone Cross. Gotta say I love JFAC's attempt at Tech Death/Prog Death, this album is awesome.","I'll have to give the full album a listen later tonight before I give it the most intriguing metal bass of last year award.

"Job For A Cowboy - The Stone Cross. Gotta say I love JFAC's attempt at Tech Death/Prog Death, this album is awesome.","I just listened to that whole album tonight and I'm probably going to listen to it a million more times. It's so good!"
"Job For A Cowboy - The Stone Cross. Gotta say I love JFAC's attempt at Tech Death/Prog Death, this album is awesome.","I hadn't heard it but I have now.  Earthborn Evolution was inspirational to listen to as a bass player.  It can have the superlative, lol.  But the bass in the new JFAC record was certainly the most surprising of the year.  Never would have expected it to sound that way--stepped up in terms of complexity and melody, even given some lead lines."
"Job For A Cowboy - The Stone Cross. Gotta say I love JFAC's attempt at Tech Death/Prog Death, this album is awesome.","I'll definitely give you surprising- the bass is a big reason why I was so shocked to hear this JFAC track in the first place. I'm very impressed with their direction.

Glad I could introduce you to BC, too!"
"Job For A Cowboy - The Stone Cross. Gotta say I love JFAC's attempt at Tech Death/Prog Death, this album is awesome.","This was exactly me the first time I checked this album out.  It's pretty damn good, to my surprise.  Wonder if they still totally blow live."
"Job For A Cowboy - The Stone Cross. Gotta say I love JFAC's attempt at Tech Death/Prog Death, this album is awesome.","I don't know what era you saw them live, but in my personal experience seeing them, they absolutely went in. That was during their touring cycle for Ruination. The only time I've gone more buck wild at a concert was when I saw Meshuggah. "

"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","Wow. I've been listening to quite a few of those bands for some time now, and had no idea they were from 'Straya. "
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","I just recently started to listen to Caligula's Horse, ""The Tide, the Thief and the River's End"" might be one of the best albums I've ever listened to. It's been on repeat all week."
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","Same here. One of my favorites."
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","Good list but it's a shame they didn't list [Osaka Punch](http://osakapunch.bandcamp.com/)."
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","Yeah that is disappointing. I would say it's because they relocated to the UK but Schoenberg are moving to Canada and they're still on the list so..."
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","Recently got into King Parrot and Disentomb. Not prog in the slightest but awesome bands."
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","Hey which of these bands are prog metal? I love Karnivool and I just found Caligula's Horse. They are awesome by the way. I'm sure the other bands are good but I'm trying to expand my musical tastes. I listen a lot to Radiohead, Snarky Puppy, The Reign of Kindo, and Punch Brothers but I'm trying to listen to more prog metal. All the bands I've listen I think are progressive in some way or sort. I just like progress haha. Thanks! "
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","You'll like Arcane. Progmetal featuring the vocalist from Caligula's Horse, who have just released a [new double album](http://arcaneaustralia.bandcamp.com/album/known-learned-double-album) this week and its one of the best things I've ever heard. It features the bassist from the band who made the list, [Ne Obliviscaris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z9PKxt_9k4), but whilst they are progmetal they are a lot heavier so I'm not sure if you'll like them or not. 

[The Helix Nebula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54LTxhbYbyA) are pretty good as well, technical instrumental stuff. [Closure in Moscow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWzSxg-CjpM) are certainly proggy, but certainly not progmetal, more like progrock. Very fun, funky, Mars Volta-y kinda stuff."
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","Hey thanks! The Ne Obli...(I'm on my phone so I can't see the name of the group) weren't really my thing.  I'll definitely have to listen to more of Arcanes stuff!  The third band (can't remember their name) was pretty cool as well. Kind of reminded me of Animals as Leaders, sort of.  And Closure in Moscow...thank you. They are SICK!!  The vocals slightly remind me of Karnivool's singer Ian.  I'm listening to their most recent album right now. The ending to Pink Lemonade threw me off though haha. It's very groovy.  I like their album a lot so far. "
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","Its a shame because Ne Obliviscaris are extremely talented musicians. I don't know if you managed to sit through the full 16 minutes of that song but the softer sections are really nice and the guitar and violin solos are insane. 

I'm glad you like Arcane, the most recent release is definitely a step up from their first album, which is good but does fall short in a couple of places. But there is a fucking huge amount of material on the new album so you'll be alright there, most of the 16 tracks are about 8 minutes long, one of them is even 23 minutes long.

The third band are The Helix Nebula, I had them pegged as somewhere in the middle of AAL, BTBAM and Scale the Summit stylistically, so yeah I get what you mean. Pretty talented guys.

Now, with Closure in Moscow you've gotta be a little careful. Their most recent album was their first in like 5 years and it was a pretty distinct change in direction. If you go too far back to their first EP then they're the most infuriatingly cliche emo/post-hardcore band, first full length album is closer to the sound of Pink Lemonade but the post-hardcore influence is still there. I personally don't mind it too much but I'm not sure where your taste lies with post-hardcore, although it is a pretty loose label at the best of times. The new album however is their best work to date most definitely."
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","Yeah I didn't really sit through the song by Ne O...(sorry their name is too difficult for me to remember.) Im just not a huge fan of screaming, though I'm ok with Monuments for some reason.  I'll go back and listen to that song and try to make it through the 16 minutes.  If you can suggest another song of theirs that you prefer, I'll definitely check it out. I listen to metal on occasion.  It's not myy genre of choice.  I really love Karnivool and AAL. They are really the only metal bands I listen to. I like Monuments ok but their songs start to sound the same after awhile, for me at least.  (Not sure if Karnivool is considered metal)

With regards to Closure in Moscow, I didn't enjoy their earlier albums.  Haha, you were right.  Pink Lemonade(album) was super refreshing though.  

If you have any band suggestions let me know! "
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","Yeah that Ne Obliviscaris song is pretty in your face from the get-go. [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMRKBz89uRQ) might be more to your liking, its my favourite from their last album. A bit more subdued and atmospheric at the start, and the screams are layered with clean vocals over the top so it might be more to your taste. Again, killer guitar and violin solos towards the end.

You might like Coheed and Cambria, my favourite band of all time. Their style changes pretty dramatically between albums, and even between individual songs on albums for that matter so finding a song that represents them is difficult. Seeing as we're on the subject of progressive metal, I'll try and show you some of their heavier stuff. I'll give you a few different examples of ones you might like judging by your tastes, but I'll keep it heavy for the time being. Try to listen all the way through each of them if you can:

[The Willing Well I: From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pn3GXm5GKI)

[In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp_Now6WDRc)

[No World for Tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuqbOCXRY9k)

[Gravity's Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4zw9qMLKUg)

[Key Entity Extraction IV: Evagria the Faithful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siUaA8qxbS4) - Not heavy

Let me know if you want any more songs, or if you're not fond. I can offer other suggestions."
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","Ha it's funny you mention Coheed and Cambria. I love their last two albums. I haven't listened to their earlier stuff though( I have heard Welcome Home). I love pretelethal and The hard sell and number city.  I'll check that Ne O.. Song out!"
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","If you were to delve into their back catalogue, I'd suggest to steer clear of Year of the Black Rainbow for the time being. Despite having Chris Pennie, the ex-Dillinger Escape Plan drummer, the album itself is a bit lackluster for Coheed. The first 3 albums are generally considered their best work, though they're all pretty good, its only YOTBR that people really have a gripe with."
"It's Australia Day and Ne Obliviscaris have listed their favourite aussie bands! Damn good list.","Good list, but was looking for Divine Ascension. They're a power-prog metal band from Australia and their latest album is pretty kickass."

Okay, so I just found this band through this video: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChIjuUeAeC4

I was listening to ""I"" by Meshuggah and discussing how hard that song would be to play with somebody from /r/Meshuggah and I saw that video in the related videos. So I decided to check out their other stuff and came across this album. 

Tell me what you guys think. They are very different. They have a female vocalist, which is definitely gonna take some getting used to, but their instrumentals are fucking brilliant! I've only heard about two songs so far and I'm still trying to decide if I love it or not, but it's definitely an interesting listen. "
"Rejectionary Art - Butterfly","Dude this music is awesome. It is like meshuggah with a girl vocalist. The screams aren't as heavy as male vocals, which I guess would be obvious (no offense to girls, but male voices are naturally deeper), but I really love her singing. It is beautiful and weird. "
"Rejectionary Art - Butterfly","Yeah, man, I agree. I'm glad you like it!"
"Rejectionary Art - Butterfly","Their second album : 

http://rejectionaryart.bandcamp.com/releases"
"Rejectionary Art - Butterfly","This is great! I was getting a strong Destiny Potato vibe from this, but these guys have been around for a while and they branch out a lot more. Great find!"
"Rejectionary Art - Butterfly","Yeah! I'm glad I happened upon this! :) It's great stuff."

"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","If you've ever run into a prog metal artist on the street or airport or somewhere outside of a concert, how were they to meet? What'd you talk about? "
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Quite literally ""outside of a concert"" but when I saw Monuments with AAL and Devin Townsend Project I got there super early to get to the front row (of course.) 

While waiting outside next to this cafe near the venue (where they ask you to line up) I saw Tosin Abasi walk out of the cafe and head inside. There were a few yells from people in line but I made eye contact with him and just nodded as to say ""have fun in there."" He smiled and nodded back. 

I wish I had a more interesting encounter."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Basically the same scenario, except with Matt Garstka. He is a very cool dude."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","The two times I've seen AAL I've yelled ""Dirty D"" as Matt sat down on the kit. He either didn't care, didn't hear me or didn't hear me because he's already in zen drumming god mode."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Definitely the last one."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Dan Briggs goes to all kinds of shows all over North Carolina and books them maybe once a year, pretty cool to see him at local hardcore shows."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","I had an hour long lesson with Aaron Marshall of Intervals before a show just about a year ago right now. Very cool dude. He was really engaging, very present- not like some ""rockstars"" who act like they couldn't care less about who they're talking to. Obviously we talked guitar, song writing, production, stuff like that. I've been playing for 17 years, and I think I learned more from him in that hour than I had in the few years prior to that. He also asked where they could find good pizza. I told them right next door at Yia Yia's. They were not disappoint. The Safety Fire was there too, so I met both Dez and Jo. 10/10 would hang again."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Aaron Marshall is very chill. He recognized me a year later which was crazy."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Was it a private session? "
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Met Mikael Akerfeldt in a Toronto bookstore once. He was super polite, we talked about his preparation for the show and I pointed him in the direction of a local record store. Pretty cool guy."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","I met James Labrie on the Progressive Nation 2009 tour. My dad and I were running late (Scale the Summit was the first of the opening acts and we missed almost all of it, except the last song they played), but as we're about to walk through the front doors of the Hard Rock Hotel I see James Labrie walking through them. I start patting my dad on the shoulder just saying, ""Dad, it's James Labrie! It's James Labrie!"" (I was 16 at the time, so I was extremely excited lol) We went up to him, saying ""hi"" and shaking his hand, pretty much star struck though. Whenever my dad goes to a concert he brings some CDs with him in the hopes of meeting one of the members and getting them signed. It definitely paid off this time as I brought my own Awake album with me and I think my dad brought SFAM P2. So I got Labrie to sign my copy of [Awake.](http://i.imgur.com/NETLs7F.jpg) Unfortunately two other guys came up out of nowhere and started talking to him, interrupting us. So my dad and I, not wanting to bug him anymore, just thanked him for his time and made our way to concert. I really wish I could've talked to him a bit more, but meeting him when it was my first/only time so far seeing DT was plenty for me."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","My favorite part of shows is meeting the band members.

I bumped into Lee from Born of Osiris in Chicago occasionally whenever djent bands play shows. I think I saw him at TesseracT, The Contortionist, and VoM shows. I bumped into him at McDonald's in Milwaukee.

I randomly met Rody Walker from Protest The Hero outside when BTBAM and deafheaven were playing in Milwaukee as PTH were playing the next day. We talked again couple of days later at the IL show. Very friendly person.

The Contortionist are great dudes and they always recognize me at the shows. Their merch guy is the VIP tbh."

"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Saw Anup Sastry (Intervals) in a poutinerie around the corner of a venue in Ottawa. Too awkward to say anything, just like every Periphery meet and greet."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","I didn't even know a poutinerie was a thing. "
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Anup is a badass. Love his solo work along with anything he plays on. "
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Saw Brent from Mastodon at a small Torche show in Atlanta. I just told him that Mastodon fucking rules."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Not prog metal, but my dad and I pulled up to our local guitar center right when Victor Wooten showed up.  We said a few things, and he was just what you'd expect.  A great guy that is very humble and respectful."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Met Blake and Dusty from BTBAM outside of a show in Mesa, AZ. Super nice guys and even posed for a picture.

"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","my friend saw trioscapes and saw dan at the bar afterwards. talked to him for a little bit and said he was a super-chill, down-to-earth guy."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Me and my bud got Misha Mansoor and Mark Holcomb to say ""what's up"" to us in Boston. *creams pants*"
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","Walking into a show last summer I saw the gentlemen of ERRA pounding out some chest and arm lifts outside their van. Looked like they brought a bench with them on tour. 

I was too starstruck to say anything.

You could definitely tell that Ian had a solid pump going for their set. "
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","I met Tosin Abasi at a local music store in Montreal. Super cool guy."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","I ran into Dusty Waring of BTBAM a few hours before a show outside of Boston, just a few blocks away from the venue. I don't know if that really counts, especially since he had exchanged emails with my girlfriend and we had planned to meet. I got to hang out with Blake Richardson later after the show, which was awesome. They were both super cool.

That night, my girlfriend and I went to a hotel nearby to sleep before we had to travel again, and when we went to the breakfast area the next morning, we ended up sitting next to Michael Keene of The Faceless. We chatted him up a bit, and it turned out to be pretty awesome.

On an unrelated note, and a relatively un-proggy one, a friend of mine once started wandering around a local town where Kvelertak were playing in hopes of finding the band lost in a coffee shop somewhere. Lo and behold, they found Kvelertak chattering away in Norwegian in a coffee shop."
"Have you ever run into a Prog Metal artist outside of a concert? Who was it? How'd it go?","It's early and I don't have my glasses on so I read this as

"Bands like BTBAM","This probably gets asked a lot, but what are some bands that are like Between the Buried and Me? I have looked at the ""Similar Artists"" sections of music stores and have done some Googling, but none of the bands that I have found really come close...."
"Bands like BTBAM","[White Arms of Athena's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPpTfqlERzE) first album, Astrodama, might be a version of Colors from an alternate dimension. It's eerie how similar they sound to BTBAM at times, but they're still excellent.

The newest self-titled album, though...I'm still trying to process just what the fuck happened. My worst disappointment of 2014.

**Edit:** Also, I have to mention the band that got me into the more metalcore side of things, Last Chance to Reason. [Level 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rxnTPfyoTY) is easily one of my favorite albums. Think Between the Buried and Me if they decided to do a cyberpunk concept album about epic battles with computer viruses."
"Bands like BTBAM","I thought the new album was hit and miss, not necessarily anything like their first - not bad just way different. 

I do remember the first time I heard Astrodrama though I thought immediately of BTBAM."
"Bands like BTBAM","Yeah, I liked the singles they released and was interested in the more sludge/post-metal vibe I was getting from it. I still like 4 of the actual songs (would have been five if the drone intro to The Transition was shorted by 4 four minutes), and I appreciate that they really took some big risks and experimented, but that album just lost me too much. I've still been going back to it, so maybe it'll grow on me."
"Bands like BTBAM","I'll say it every time. Black Crown Initiate. Look up their EP, Song for the Crippled Bull. Then go to the full length.  The EP I'd a masterpiece."
"Bands like BTBAM","I was not too impressed with the full length"
"Bands like BTBAM","The full length was excellent, they just decided to get a lot heavier than their initial EP. When you consider the EP was essentially just one long song, there was a lot of different directions they could have taken the new album."
"Bands like BTBAM","Honestly, I thought the full length was okay. [But the EP is beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhY8-iJnZ-M)."
"Bands like BTBAM","I've always thought the band [The Odious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peW4wjfc894) reminded me of the musical style of BTBAM. They are more raw, but have tons of versatility and on top of that they are all great musicians."
"Bands like BTBAM","I LOVE JOINT VENTURES"
"Bands like BTBAM","[Last Scattering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0ZCxF_aZH0). I'd say that they are also an acquired taste similar to BTBAM but once you listen to their album a few times it starts to sound very good."
"Bands like BTBAM","That is pretty good! "

"Know any bands with an eastern, exotic, or tribal feel to them?","I'm really into atmospheric bands that envelope you in their sound, specifically ones that have an arabesque feel to them, such as Myrath and Jericco.  In addition, I've always loved music with traditional elements to them (Eluveitie is one of my favorite bands of all time), but I've had a hard time finding a progressive group that encorporates such elements into their music on an extensive scale.  Portions of Unitopia and United Progressive Front's tracks offer such a feel with the tribal drums, exotic flutes, and tambourines, but there has to be more out there somewhere!

For further reference, I'm way more into clean vocals when it comes to progressive music...in fact, instrumentals are fine, too. "

"Stick Men - Fugue [2010]","The good ones are virtually unknown most of the time, it's quite a shame."
"Stick Men - Fugue [2010]","I'm a non-trad biology student at my university.  One of the profs is also a heavy prog head (also a bass player) so we went to the gig.  

My wife doesn't really do prog and didn't get them until about the third song.  That third song was a structured improv and she said that seeing how the chaos coalesced into what we would call ""music"" and then decomposed again, and then back to structure, etc somehow made their style click with her and she enjoyed the rest of the show immensely.  Levin is an amazing artist."
"Stick Men - Fugue [2010]","They do take some time to get used to for sure. A friend actually recommended this band to me a few years ago and this song kind of stuck with me. What state do you live in?"

I have to be honest, I didn't like the lyrics on Language as much as Johnathan's Carpenter's lyrics on the previous two LP's. I found they lost that sciency/nature feel and went full on Philosophy 101. They are still growing on me and the music in the album is fantastic. I'm very optimistic for their next release!

"This is simultaneously offensive and addicting: Periphery's ""All new materials"" mashed up with ""Firework"" by Katy Perry","You have a bad ear...

Or you're just spouting shit without knowing what you're talking about. The *melody* (what do you mean by chords lining up?) harmonizes well within the context of periphery's chord progression.

I think where you're going wrong is in wanting the song to have the same feel as Periphery's version. The melody obviously doesn't create the same context/emotions with periphery's chords *because it's not the same melody*. But as for everything being in key and harmonizing well? It actually works quite well because it creates a vastly different feeling than Periphery's version and even sounds a bit haunting at times without there being any over-bearing moments of dissonance."

"This is simultaneously offensive and addicting: Periphery's ""All new materials"" mashed up with ""Firework"" by Katy Perry","&gt; The voicings for the melody are strange and don't follow the thirds of the chord progression, like many will.

I'm fairly certain melodies don't have to follow thirds. This isn't the 16th century.

&gt;Also I'm certain that the Perry track is very slightly sharp.

This actually suits the track really well. It's only a recent phenomenon that singers are engineered to be SO on point with their singing (if you think Sotello isn't getting a slight autotune in the mixing think again). Many singers over the last century were slightly sharp/slightly flat on purpose because it created a unique vibe.

The whole effect is to make the song rather haunting and tense. And in my opinion *more* metal than the original. Christ almighty when did metal become so *clean*?

I mean, are you really upset that the song breaks a few rules? Because rule-breaking in music makes the best kind of music.

I think I should add that if music didn't break a few rules every decade or so there would be no metal, much less periphery, and forget about periphery's jazzy moments."

"This is simultaneously offensive and addicting: Periphery's ""All new materials"" mashed up with ""Firework"" by Katy Perry","There's a big difference in a song ""breaking a few rules"" and a song breaking the fundamental rules of tonality and good song-writing.  You don't have a melody in major and a progression in Lydian because you are going to have a half step difference between the raised fourth in the accompaniment and the 4th and 5th in the melody.  Dissonances are necessary in music, but they have to be resolved correctly or it will sound like crap.  The issue with this mashup is smashing two things together that do not completely fit."
"This is simultaneously offensive and addicting: Periphery's ""All new materials"" mashed up with ""Firework"" by Katy Perry","No offense man but I actually study music at college and the truth is there simply ARE no rules as you're putting them. You can have a melody in major and a chord progression in lydian easily. You know why? Because the melody becomes lydian by virtue of the context of the chord progression.

Furthermore you're trying to argue that it sounds like crap because of ""too many dissonances"" to which I reply that you need to listen to more metal beyond periphery. This sort of thing is extremely common in metal. It's *more* common in metal, even, to have shit tons of dissonance at multiple points than it is for things to adhere to rules of harmony. The majority of metal doesn't give a fuck all about resolution or consonance anyway."

"This is simultaneously offensive and addicting: Periphery's ""All new materials"" mashed up with ""Firework"" by Katy Perry","I guess what bugs me more than anything is that you're trying to apply rules of traditional harmony to metal. It just doesn't work. I couldn't even begin to tell you how much metal is wholly chromatic in nature, totally eschewing diatonicism, yet still sounding melodic.

Because the entire point of metal is dissonance. Metal takes ugly and makes it powerful.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjhbTb3k3YE) btw is what I'm talking about. this is an entirely chromatic melody that falls on absolutely no diatonic scale (talking about the intro btw), yet still sounds extremely melodic. I suppose you're going to tell me that it too, does not work according to your ""ear""."
"This is simultaneously offensive and addicting: Periphery's ""All new materials"" mashed up with ""Firework"" by Katy Perry","This is not a chromatic melody.  It completely falls into a scale with one deviation.  The Ukranian Dorian Scale (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Dorian_scale)

Here is the sheet music for the intro
http://www.sheetmusicdirect.us/sheetmusic/song/1000149116/insurrection?redirect=1

The harmony surrounding it supports the notes of that scale.  Yes it is not a traditional mode, but it very much has rules.  And yes there are dissonances in your LoG example.

The difference is that dissonances have to be approached and resolved in a way that works with the music around it.  If you look at the sheet music link I posted, I'll point out two examples of dissonances being resolved effectively.  The first note in the melody is a minor 2nd from the tonic of the intro chord, but it resolves in the melody to the tonic.  This is a suspension, very similar to every suspension ever written going back to Bach chorales.  You'll also see that they change chords on the fourth beat of measure 2 (from D5 to C5), this is to resolve the M2 between the melody and the chords.  Lamb of God follows rules governing how to properly resolve a dissonance.  They do it very well in fact.

The problem with the Periphery/Perry video is that the dissonances are not treated and resolved effectively which gives a displeasing sound to the ear.  

Metal musicians DO give a fuck about rules of dissonance and consonance, some of them probably just don't know it.  All musicians grow up with a harmonic language in their head and it affects how they play and how they write.  Metal musicians may use more dissonances that have a grittier sound (particularly with distorted guitars), but it still fits into traditional harmony.  I bet if you talked to someone like John Petrucci or Tosin Abasi, they would be able to give you a pretty highbrow analysis of how to analyze a piece of their music in terms of metal and music's rules.

My biggest argument with your comments is that metal absolutely falls within traditional harmonic language.  Does it sound like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilGthRhwP8

Or this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8496Rk-Kl8

No it does not.  Those examples are truly chromatic music.  Metal has harmony, most of it is Western based.  It would not sound good if it deviated too heavily from some of the rules that govern what our ears perceive based on what we have heard growing up.  It is true that many bands push the sonic envelope, but many of them do so in a manner similar to jazz, by adding extended 7ths, 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths to chords.  By using more complex forms and time signatures and rhythms.  But underneath all of that there is still a sense of harmony.  True chromaticism was rejected by the masses in the early 20th century as it is not something that our musical minds can latch onto and make sense of.  

You can spout bullshit all day about metal being devoid of rules but it is COMPLETELY FALSE.  Drummers play drum fills leading into big section changes.  Most songs will end on the tonic chord.  Most songs will use some sort of mode or scale that can be described and is harmonized effectively.  Singers do not like to sing melodies that make no sense.  I guarantee you if Katy Perry was given that Periphery backing track to sing Fireworks over, she would fucking hate it, because the notes she is singing do not make sense in the context of the chords. 

Pretty much all of our statements saying metal is outside the realm of traditional harmony is wrong.  It does not totally eschew diatonicism.  There decidedly are rules.  "
"This is simultaneously offensive and addicting: Periphery's ""All new materials"" mashed up with ""Firework"" by Katy Perry","If you played the LoG Insurrection intro in numerical order instead of the musical order it's in, you'd have a 6 tone chromatic row. That's far far outside of even an exotic scale like the Ukranian Dorian. It's purely chromatic.

B is treated as the root in the melodic progression. So let's take B Ukranian Dorian: B-Db-E-F-G-Ab-Bb and compare it to whatever LoG is doing in that intro (for the sake of simplicity I've chopped the intro up into a linear scale): B-Db-Eb-E-F-Gb-G-Ab.

So we've actually got two deviations, not just one. A chromatic addition of an Eb and a Gb. One chromatic addition and you can call it a bebop scale or a scale with a blue note. However you want to slice your pie. Two and it's just chromatic.

&gt;The difference is that dissonances have to be approached and resolved in a way that works with the music around it. If you look at the sheet music link I posted, I'll point out two examples of dissonances being resolved effectively. 

Dissonances don't have to be anything. It's like telling a painter that if he uses teal he MUST use orange. He doesn't have to use shit. He's free to utilize the tools at his disposal to create art how he sees fit and if that means a fuck ton of unresolved dissonance (which metal is chock full of btw) that's how he does it.

&gt;The problem with the Periphery/Perry video is that the dissonances are not treated and resolved effectively which gives a displeasing sound to the ear.

In your opinion. And you're a minority.

&gt;Metal musicians DO give a fuck about rules of dissonance and consonance, some of them probably just don't know it. All musicians grow up with a harmonic language in their head and it affects how they play and how they write. Metal musicians may use more dissonances that have a grittier sound (particularly with distorted guitars), but it still fits into traditional harmony.

Tell that to the guys responsible for the bulk of death metal.

Even great gobs of metalcore which usually sticks to Aeolian and Harmonic minor pretty religiously is full of moments where dissonance goes completely unresolved. This is used very successfully to create tension and leave the listener hanging. 

In fact, if you take a bunch of bands often accused of being cheesy (think Trivium or Bullet for my Valentine) the common thread is often that these bands are *extremely consonant* to a fault. They spend entirely too much time obeying harmonic rules and the result is often forgettable song-writing.

&gt;I bet if you talked to someone like John Petrucci or Tosin Abasi, they would be able to give you a pretty highbrow analysis of how to analyze a piece of their music in terms of metal and music's rules.

Right. But those guys write with music theory firmly in the back of their heads. The majority of metal musicians have a rudimentary theory knowledge at best. Most of them are winging it on instinct, often doing things very very wrong but sounding very very right in the end.

&gt;No it does not. Those examples are truly chromatic music. Metal has harmony, most of it is Western based. It would not sound good if it deviated too heavily from some of the rules that govern what our ears perceive based on what we have heard growing up.

Dimebag Darrell was infamous for soloing straight tone rows with nothing resembling an actual scale behind what he was playing. There's a huge number of solos of his which pretty much go 5-6-7-8-7-6-5-4-5-so-on-so-forth. He still manages to make it sound great, IMO, though there's more than a few critics who disagree with his method.

Meshuggah, btw, actually falls pretty in line with traditional chromatic playing. There's nothing resembling harmony or scales behind their music. The only key difference between Meshuggah and Schoenberg in terms of composition is that meshuggah grooves a whole lot harder.

&gt;Pretty much all of our statements saying metal is outside the realm of traditional harmony is wrong. It does not totally eschew diatonicism.

This is the only thing you're right about. Outside of those artists on the very outer edge like the aforementioned Meshuggah or the Dimebag solos most metal typically steps outside of the bounds of harmony briefly. Or they find ways to step outside of harmony while still sounding melodic. The LoG example doesn't work because they're a mere 2 notes away from being in a legitimate scale. It works because they keep the chromatic degrees far enough away from each other that the listener's ear isn't immediately assaulted by the dissonance. There's just enough unexpectation to create tension but it doesn't sound ugly. It's the same idea behind riffing something and then in the next measure taking the whole riff down by a half step. You're stepping outside of the scale you set up with the first part of the riff in order to create tension and eschew expectation but by keeping that outside step in its own measure our ears separate it and forgive it.

And just a personal aside, IMO I vastly prefer what's being done with the KP remix of this song over the original version. I hate how clean and neat Sotello's melodies actually are. It just doesn't sound very metal at the end of the day. I want some fucking tension. I WANT to hear some slightly flat notes. I WANT the fucker to clash with the chords a little bit. Because then it would actually be interesting."
"This is simultaneously offensive and addicting: Periphery's ""All new materials"" mashed up with ""Firework"" by Katy Perry","Ukranian Dorian in B would be B-C#-D-E#-F#-G#-A-B so the only deviation is the E natural, which is a borrowed tone to outline the A5 power chord.  Why did they do this?  Because using the E# would have sounded really weird in the context of this.  They broke out of the scale to make it more consonant.

As to your comment about the painter, it's ok to break rules as long as you have a point to it.  If the painter painted a fruit basket normally, but painted the orange (fruit) teal, he should probably have a good reason for it.  Likewise in music its ok to break rules, but there has to be reasoning.  And usually ""it sounds cool"" means that it falls into some semblance of sense according to the rules of music, rock, metal, whatever.

I agree that most metal writers don't have a firm background in theory, but they've grown up listening to whatever they listened to and unless they grew up on Schoenberg, they've heard a musical language with rules.

This dude did a good Meshuggah analysis.  http://www.ahk.nl/uploads/tx_ahklichtingen/Master_research_Meshuggah_1377265300.pdf

On p 22 he talks about the various sections use of harmony.  You are correct that some of the sections use atonal techniques like bouncing between G Ab, but Riff F is a mixolydian improvisation.  And like you said, Meshuggah is the exception and not the rule.

I don't honestly listen to much metalcore, I would love to hear examples of what you are talking about.  Most of the death metal I listen to has some harsh timbral sounds as far as the vocals and guitars are concerned but they still have a harmony that makes sense, again I'd love to hear examples of what you are referring to.

With Dimebag's soloing, the number example (if they are half-steps, not sure by your notation) you give I can see a pattern that chromatically outlines a m3 from the root (5) to the m3 (8) down to a Do-Ti-Do at the root (5-4-5).  And soloing is kind of a whole other beast anyway...

Even most ""classical music"" that is atonal can be argued to have tonal influences.  The reason for this is music has rules like a language, so you can deviate from them.  But you're still going to have to provide some sort of structure to have the listener make sense of it.  And if you have grown up with hearing music and playing music it is going to be difficult to get that out of your ear unless you completely disconnect from the music making like the serialists did.  That's an argument we discussed at length in some of my theory classes in grad school.

I'm honestly not trying to be a dick I'm trying to show you the error in some of your arguments.  And I would appreciate not being knocked down, as you have no idea what my background is.  I happen to be a composer and have a masters in music, so I know what I'm saying is correct.  And you may disagree with my initial comment which is fine, but your theory is seriously flawed dude.

We are both in agreement about Periphery's singer.  I am not a fan of the recent trend of metal singers coming from the pop punk singing school.  Monument is the same way. I'm usually a fan of clean singing, but I'm more on board with an operatic/musical theater style singer like Bruce Dickinson, Devin Townsend, James Labrie, etc.  "

I mean, you're losing serious credibility when you're criticizing a metal mix for not adhering to strict rules of harmony. May as well call bebop scales wrong because of that one chromatic tone thrown in.

So many advancements in music in the 20-21st century have been made by doing things wrong and throwing harmony out the window. Periphery owes a lot of its existence to jazz which throws in clashing dissonant notes like bird seed in the park.

The melody has too many dissonances with the chord progression.  Katy Perry's melody was written for a very simple progression with only triads and contains only the notes of the original key.  Periphery's progression that accompanies Katy is not just simple triads several have added sevenths or other non chord tones. Giving it more of a listen and doing some research, I think Periphery's progression is in Lydian which would make the key of the accompaniment different than the melody (which is in major). Thus there are several notes that clash with Katy's melody.

The melody lines up fine enough in that Periphery's basic chord progression matches Katy's original, but those non chord tones that are involved in Periphery's riffs don't stick completely to the basic triad harmony that is in the original which what caused my original comment.

I suppose you could say it has a haunting sound, but I think the dissonances are too frequent and too intense for me to give this a thumbs up.

All this said, I love the underlying riffs and I like the original song.  They are much more exciting musically than the accompaniment to Fireworks.  Metal has a much richer harmonic language than pop music ever will and this is a good example of why smashing the two together will not often yield good results"
"This is simultaneously offensive and addicting: Periphery's ""All new materials"" mashed up with ""Firework"" by Katy Perry","I'm pretty sure they do. Don't know how to express this since my english isn't that good but I just think since there are additional notes to the original song by Periphery they just don't form like the same line, the same melody in your head. But everything that is layed over the original track lines up as far as I can tell. It just doesn't really work like most other mashup-songs. "

Its just... So... NOT Periphery. I know Clear is an experimental EP though, so its alright."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","I find it strange that my favourite song from that project was actually The Parade Of Ashes. Would probably have made a great Mothership song (if Spencer goes back to that, which I hope he does, he could always include it live), and I loved The Mothership's demos. Still, can see why people would dislike it."

I still can't differentiate any of their songs from each other and I've been listening to them for 2 years. ^(don't kill me)"
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","That's exactly how I feel. You're not alone. That said, I don't like their vocalist and their songs all sound the same."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","I keep trying to listen to them but their vocalist puts me off every time I gotta be honest"
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","He sounds too angsty, like he should be singing for an emo/[crabcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDzt6yI3Dw8) band. I can get a similar (better) sound from TesseracT and Daniel Tompkins is back! "
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","I felt the same way about a lot of their songs but after really listening I loved it.  "
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Agreed. It's so dance-pop, and Spencer's vocals are abnormally grating."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Personally, mine would be [Sky Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRFHR19EW34) by The Devin Townsend Project. It's just a bit too pop for my tastes, which is strange because I loved Epicloud and the rest of Sky Blue. I know Devin cited Usher as an influence for this song, and not being a fan of Usher, probably explains it a bit. It's also just a bit too basic in it's structure and pretty unexciting musically. I still like it (I'm actually listening to it as I write this, I feel so two faced), but it's probably the least interest I've had in a song by the DTP."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Similar for me, expect instead of Sky Blue it's Ih-Ah."

"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Sky Blue is weird for me, because I've never been a fan of basic pop rock, but this just got really emotional for me. Maybe it's the lyrics or Anneke's glorious voice and that part before the last chorus. I just love it. "
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Same musician, but my song is War. I have never liked it, and I really dislike that Dev's made it a live staple. If I'm watching a Dev show, that's the song I skip over."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","I love War. Just the whole swing time thing that I'm a sucker for I guess. It's also pretty relateable for me, I've struggled with sleep problems before (not in years) but the lyrics of that song describe pretty much how I felt most nights.

I think War's a cool song, personally :)"

"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","I actually prefer the latter half, it's emotional and quite fun to sing."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","For me, it would have to be Tilting Against Windmills. Rody's lyrics were obviously never on par with Arif's but he really displays he lack of intelligence and awareness in that song."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","How so?

And, my least favorite song on Volition has to be A Life Embossed. I still consider it a good song, it's just, it's the heaviest and most dramatic song on the album, and you think it's about this huge thing, what with the vivid language and Holocaust references, when it's just about... the pitbull terrier ban in Toronto."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Didn't Rody write the lyrics to Hair Trigger? I think those are my favourite PtH lyrics. Full of clever puns and metaphors."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","He did.  The only lyrics Arif wrote on Scurrilous were C'est La Vie, Moonlight and Sex tapes. "

"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","I thought that Tandem had some really great lyrics, and I actually assumed Arif wrote them."

"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","While I agree with /u/helgihermadur, I like Through Her Eyes only in the context of the album.

"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","I agree it's worth a listen,  I know plenty of people that really like the album, it just isn't for me. Too much punk sound going on and Rody's singing is laughable to me on that album. "

"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Looking at Luke's big solo moment in These Colours Don't Run is actually crazy to think that once, that was the epitome of his skill level. Now, he's a guitar god with awesome technical stuff in pretty much every song."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Definitely. His voice has matured since then and the bands technical skill has shot through the roof. "
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Wasn't calculated when they were really young? Not saying that's an excuse to like it or anything, because you did say it may not count. But I couldn't have done something like that at that age."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Yeah,  they were extremely young. They were still young when they put out Kezia. And I agree,  I couldn't have done something like that at that age or my current age. They've always been talented dudes. "
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Extremely so. My friend would trash talk PtH all day and say they ended riffs in the same scale. Maybe he was just jealous haha"
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Well yeah they were just kids.. of course it sucks. Tons of great bands have shitty first albums that they were able to bury away somewhere.

"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Dream Theater has really missed on a lot of their recent ""ballads"" like Far From Heaven, Beneath the Surface, and the aforementioned Along for the Ride.  Dream Theater has had some great ballads, like The Silent Man, Hollow Years, Through her Eyes, and especially Wait for Sleep, but the recent ones feel so boring and flat.

Still, I feel the worst Dream Theater songs are You Not Me and Build Me Up, Break Me Down.  Both have some decent moments, but should be in their wheelhouse and they miss terribly."

"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","My favourite band shifts, was BTBAM for a long time, recently it's Protest The Hero, and even more recently Periphery (Juggernaut!)

I'll go with Jetpacks Was Yes! by Periphery. Compared to every other song on their Self Titled it seems just too simple and slow.

"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Dude(tte), Jetpacks Was Yes! is an awesome song! It's certainly not as driving as most other songs, or exciting, but the lyrics are awesome, and it's still well-written instrumentally. I'd say the weakest song off the self-titled is Letter Experiment; kinda boring after a bit and not too varied.

As for worst Periphery song, though, it's either Parade of Ashes or Alpha IMO. Too poppy, instrumentally kinda boring, and generally not enjoyable in terms of vocals.

This whole album is fun, aggressive, in-your-face metal until this song.  It's kind of a ballad, but not really?  It really doesn't work with the rest of the album imo, even if it's meant as some sort of interlude."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Anything off Opeth or Katatonias first 2 records. I just hate old school death metal like that. Funny because Still Life is my favorite Opeth album"
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","The only thing I can complain about with Orchid and Morningrise is that the songs don't really flow like later Opeth at all, and just seem to be about 10 ideas put together. I like the music, just wish it worked better as a whole.

"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","I kinda wish Opeth would rerecord Under a Weeping Moon.  That song starts off so pretty.  But the quality just sounds so archaic.  "
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","This is such a refreshing post! Everyone goes on about their favourite songs from these awesome bands, and we hardly seem to highlight where our beloved bands are at fault.

Having said that, Fossil Genera by BTBAM never really struck a chord with me. I typically appreciate the goofier side of the band, but the circus-y theme just doesn't do it for me. [This part](http://youtu.be/_XX4aXkjwTo?t=7m36s) sums up my distaste. What also bugs me about the song is the fact that they've played it probably 4 out of the 6 times i've seen them, when they could've used up 12 precious minutes of their set to play something I would enjoy more :'( "

"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","I had to go down my list of favorite bands to find a song I didn't like. I stopped at Modern Day Babylon. Travelers is an amazing record. That last song before the vocal versions completely kill the end for me. Thaller Than Thall is everything wrong with djent as a genre. It's a bunch of chugs over an uninspired poly rhythm drum beat with some ambience and scales with a clean spacey type tone. It's soooooo slooooooow! Ughhhhhhhh, boring! I will skip that song 95% of the time. "

"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","5 Deep On Charlie by The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza. If your a fan, more than likely you'll disagree with me since it has been regarded as their trademark song but I just can't get into it. I think it's just taste. And yes, I do like their older stuff before Josh was in the band."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Favorite band: Opeth. 

Least favorite song: The Funeral Portrait. 

Thing is, that's not technically my least favorite song by them. If I were to be objective about it I'd probably name something off of Heritage, maybe Slither. But subjectively Blackwater Park is an impeccable work of art and a triumph of originality and there's just something a bit bland and unnecessarily repetitive to me about that song and i feel it ever so slightly interrupts the masterful flow of BWP which saddens me a bit every time I listen to that album from front to back, and because if that I'm dubbing it my least favorite. "
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Black Rose Immortal - Opeth, i just don't feel it."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","A Sight to Behold by Gojira. Hate the intro. Otherwise, I really love everything else.

A close second to Gojira is Mastodon, and for them, I'd say that I truly hate anything off The Hunter except Stargasm. Fuck Curl of the Burl especially."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Probably Milk Lizard by Dillinger.

Dillinger are my favorite ever since I've first heard Option Paralysis in the beginning of 2013.

Milk Lizard was the first song I've heard from them back in 2010. At the time I was listening to a lot of witless metalcore/deathcore like emmure, asking alexandria, blabla... I was 15 years old. A slightly older friend suggested dillinger, so I've watched the first music video that was suggested on youtube.

My expectations were high and the music was completely different, than what I expected. So I hated the song and thought the band sucked...

Nowadays I really like Milk Lizard. Especially the chorus. But I still like most songs more. I just have this weird relationship with the song."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Milk Lizard was my starting place, as well as the other more ""normal"" Dillinger songs too. I probably couldn't have gotten into them if it weren't for those, but nowadays it's their hectic shit that I love most. Noone quite like them."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","I love the songs the most, where they manage to paint this contrastful picture of beauty and dread like in farewell mona lisa, baby's first coffin or paranoia shields. Greg does a wonderful job with his beautiful voice and aggressive shouting. Great thing is, that they've had this dynamic songwriting forever and the insane contrast ever since greg joined."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Autodidact by Between the Buried and Me. It just feels like less thought and creativity went into the riffs."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","That's one of my favorite btbam songs :'("
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","What? What about all those crazy bass and piano parts at the end? That song has plenty of awesome riffs"
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","For me it would probably be one of those random songs on their first album."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","At the very least it beats Laser Speed. There's nothing speedy about that closer to Alaska."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","No way that's my favorite pre - colors song.... I hate you :( "
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Disease, Injury, Madness by BTBAM. The only sour note off an otherwise utterly flawless album. I can't explain it, the song rubs me the wrong way. The first half is annoying and I can't ever get into the song. I wonder if making a personal cut of the song and listening to the album through would give me a feeling of completion, or if I'd just be vandalizing art because I don't understand it? "
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","Haha dude don't think too deeply into that. Art is what you want to make of it. I like that song but it's definitely one of the more bland songs they've out out since colors"
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","I think that's the best song on TGM, the worst one being Swim To The Moon, which is still and amazing track, I just think the middle of the song drags on too long."
"What is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?","That album is really great, but I do have to agree with you on the dragged out bit. But otherwise, the lyrics, music, and all else are incredible."
"I've never listened to Devin Townsend, where do I start?","I know this is kinda sacrilegious of me to say, but I have honestly never even attempted to listen to anything Devin has put out. Where do I start / what should I expect? "
"I've never listened to Devin Townsend, where do I start?","Seeing that Hevy Devy is my favorite artist of all time, I shall be your guide on this epic journey! :D

* Start out with some of his more recent works like *Epicloud* and *Sky Blue*. They're a good appetizer sampler for his many different styles and then work your way through the Devin Townsend Project series chronologically. *Ki* has wonderful blues elements and it's one of his more somber pieces. I secretly think it may be the best of the DTP series. *Addicted* is a pop-metal album with many fun tunes and is one of my favorites. *Deconstruction* is considered by many to his masterpiece, due to its technicality and lavishly chaotic nature; I love the album, but it's not my favorite. Last is *Ghost*. This record is nothing but pure beauty. It's probably my most listened to Devin Townsend record. Save it for last.

* If you're in the mood for more ambient prog-rock stuff, then venture into *Accelerated Evolution* and *Synchestra*. Both are fantastic albums that feature Devin in a less intense environment, but don't worry, they still have quite an edge to them.

* Or if you're digging his heavier side, then venture into Strapping Young Lad. I recommend starting with *City* and then going through the rest of them chronologically, as well. *Alien* and *The New Black* are standouts among these releases, but they're all great.

* At any point, go through his solo albums, starting with *Ocean Machine*. They're all fantastic, especially *Terria* and the two *Ziltoid* albums. There's nothing Devin does better than an all-out, balls-to-the-wall rock opera.

* Also, DO NOT FORGET about *Casualties of Cool*. It's a beautiful, very bluesy record that I cannot recommend enough for late night chill sessions or driving down lonely roads.

Enjoy!"
"I've never listened to Devin Townsend, where do I start?","I got into Devin listening to Ziltoid the Omniscient. I saw him at warped tour with strapping young lad and will always remember the quote ""I feel like 10lbs of ass in a 5lb ziplock bag. Fuck you!"" lol. Depending on your tastes I'd highly recommend Ziltoid for comic metal genius, his guest appearance on Ayreon to get a sense of how insane his voice can be, Ocean Machines ""The Death of Music"", Synchestra/ Accelerated Evolution for pure Devin awesomeness, and of course the Ki quadrilogy with each album portraying a different aspect/genre of Devin music which all form into the whole of a fully realised genius musician. You will enjoy this :)"
"I've never listened to Devin Townsend, where do I start?","&gt; I got into Devin listening to Ziltoid the Omniscient. 

Me too, very good start I think"
"I've never listened to Devin Townsend, where do I start?","In the time you asked this question, he released two more.  Better get started!"
"I've never listened to Devin Townsend, where do I start?","The debut album Ocean Machine is pretty good to start with I think."
"I've never listened to Devin Townsend, where do I start?","The first 4 Devin Townsend albums are all great.  I guess start with the first album, Ocean Machine."
"I've never listened to Devin Townsend, where do I start?","I was in the same position as you, only it was 4 months ago.[ I slowly got into Devin by listening to Epicloud from front to back.](https://play.spotify.com/album/3J2wQEjaJGCfStdLgKFgxl) It is a great album and I really do think you will like it. It's different from other prog metal you have experienced before, I think.

Here's to hoping you enjoy Devin Townsend Project as much as I do now!

"I've never listened to Devin Townsend, where do I start?","That's pretty bang-on.  Would definitely suggest Addicted! as a starter album.  Very accessible."
"I've never listened to Devin Townsend, where do I start?","Synchestra, Addicted, Deconstruction - in that order."
"I've never listened to Devin Townsend, where do I start?","I personally love his album Deconstruction just because it's insanely chaotic. The title track is wonderfully random and shows off the talent he has that he often holds back."
"I've never listened to Devin Townsend, where do I start?","I started with Deconstruction and soon followed with Ziltoid(1). They remain my two favorite albums."

"David Maxim Micic - Daydreamers","I've discussed how in love I am with Bilo 3.0 before, so I'll try to point out something new this time: How cool will it be for David's niece (the child singing halfway through) to hear this track as she grows up? Out of the ordinary documentation of someone's childhood, that's for sure, but awesome! ""Oh, here's me as a kid, singing on a phenomenal progmetal album""."
"David Maxim Micic - Daydreamers","I love it when bands/people do that. Like in BTBAM's Parallax 2, the song Autumn (though most people dont like it) was part made by Tommy's - the vocalist- child. "
"David Maxim Micic - Daydreamers","Wow, that is cool, I'll check it out asap! I've been working on including a few friends for my own stuff, it's a great excuse to keep in touch with people and create something that is a reminder of them, using their talents to add more to your own work.

Thanks for the heads up about Autumn."
"David Maxim Micic - Daydreamers","Oh lol, no, it's just space noises."
"David Maxim Micic - Daydreamers","I love that part and how purposefully placed it is. I love how flawlessly Bilo 3.0 as an album conveys the tumultuous but exciting process that is growing up, and this closing track is the perfect retrospective. A reminder to keep a sense of innocence and wonder and to not take anything for granted. I love this album so much. "
"David Maxim Micic - Daydreamers","Yeah, it's amazing the progression from the three eps. They're all wonderful, but the difference between 1.0 and 3.0 is crazy. The organic quality of 3.0, like you said there's all this sense of wonder about it, and a ton of bittersweet nostalgic feelings. It's odd, with how retrospective 3.0 is, it sounds like it could be the closing of the saga, but there's to be one more. I have no idea what 4.0 and his new ECO/EGO thing will sound like, but I can be reasonably certain I'll enjoy it immensely."
"David Maxim Micic - Daydreamers","That acoustic part near the end is fucking amazing!

"David Maxim Micic - Daydreamers","I love that part it's one of my favorite parts in the album along with the scat solo in ""Where Is Now""."
"David Maxim Micic - Daydreamers","Yes! Also the guitar solo in that song is awesome "
"David Maxim Micic - Daydreamers","Even though i heard this a few months ago, this album, and pretty much all of David's work 'clicked' for me this week. And in all honesty Bilo 3.0 is one of my favourite albums ever. It seriously is just as good as Portal of I - which has been my favourite album for 2 years now.

"David Maxim Micic - Daydreamers","In his defense, he did link to the time of the specific song (Daydreamers), not his fault DMM didn't upload each song separately. The youtube link you posted isn't from David's channel, seems kinda bullshitty for 'Arnav Barua' to benefit any more from music that isn't his. Better the views go to David."
"David Maxim Micic - Daydreamers","Sure, that's why I also suggested the Bandcamp link, where you can directly purchase the music. As it stands, he still submitted a link to a full album stream, which is against the rules of the subreddit. I'm not trying to be a jerk, just trying to help keep the place clean from posts which break the subreddit's rules."
"David Maxim Micic - Daydreamers","See, I agree with you that according to the letter of the law, he submitted a link which technically contained a full album stream. However, his post was titled about a specific song, and the link went to that specific song, so it seems that taking the *spirit* of the law logically, he submitted a 1 song link, that happens to contain the rest of the album surrounding it. He didn't title his link ""DMM - Bilo 3.0 (check out daydreamer, it's my favorite!)"" submitting the album for consideration as a whole, he focused in on the specificity of the content desired for listening. Just like if you submitted a single song that happened to be part of a youtube playlist of an album, it'd still be okay.

I'm not disagreeing with you, and it's certainly a matter of semantics regarding the interpretation of the rule, I'd be curious if a mod could clarify for future reference."

"Intervals ""A Voice Within"" to be released in Instrumental form.","I think you will be able to hear them a lot better, I wonder if the mix is adjusted from the final mix or if the vocal tracks are just removed.

On another note: I did notice a big shift in composition from In Time to A Voice Within where the chorus guitar/bass parts are plainer to 'make room' for the vocal part. This is done by design to make sure there isn't too much going on when there *are* vocal tracks. This contrasts the composition of In Time where the lyrical bits are done by the lead guitar. I noticed Tesseract also does this 'making room for the vocalist' a lot as listening to their instrumental album is actually pretty boring in a lot of parts."
"Intervals ""A Voice Within"" to be released in Instrumental form.","That is what good bands do, make room for the vocals. I bet you they could release it without fixing the mix and it will sound great.  Why? I have a feeling the record was mixed as a instrumental record with vocals on top.

"Intervals ""A Voice Within"" to be released in Instrumental form.","Could be!

"Opeth - When","I will never not upvote an Opeth song in this sub"
"Opeth - When","One of the best Opeth songs."
"Opeth - When","Yep, it's in my top 20 Opeth songs"
"Opeth - When","Haha I love that that's a legitimate thing. "
"Opeth - When","There are so many amazing songs that it's hard even to make a top 20 though. "
"Opeth - When","Definitely one of my all time favorites. I still listen to it at least once every few days, usually every day though. "
"Opeth - When","I got into Opeth back when downloading music one song at a time (with a dial-up modem) was a thing. The tracks I grabbed from MAYH were ""April Ethereal"" and ""Demon of the Fall"". I remember once I finally heard the full CD and ""When"" kicked in, I was just like *Oh my gosh, the whole album is this good.*"
"Opeth - When","Opeth was my first metal band too.

When I was younger, think 14 or 15, like most kids I listened to the rock/pop playing on the radio. In the after-school center, we had this room with a pool table and a stereo where the older kids could bring their CDs and play them. At the time, one of the more popular poprock bands had released a CD that had some hard rock songs on it, most didn't like it, but I did. And I played it everytime I could. One of the youth workers there came up to me one time and suggested I listened to some metal and handed me a copy of *Ghost Reveries*. I came home and listened to it and never looked back."
"Opeth - When","I got to metal via radio rock, buying Filter's ""Title of Record"" (""Welcome to the Fold"" is *really* heavy for a 1999 MTV viewer), then getting Deftones ""White Pony"" (ditto ""Elite"", easily the heaviest song I'd heard at that age), then my first proper metal album was Living Sacrifice's ""The Hammering Process"" which I listened to nonstop until I got into more Solid State Records stuff. Extol became my favorite band of that group (for good reason), and that led me to other progressive death metal like Opeth. "
"Opeth - When","I discovered those two first as well, and I just listened to them without hearing the rest of the album.  Luckily, one time I didn't change the song after April Ethereal ended, and I was introduced to this beautiful masterpiece. "
"Opeth - When","Followed by Ghost of Prediction. "
"Opeth - When","That's the prequel. "
"Opeth - When","damnit."
"Opeth - When","That riff at 4:25 is impossible not to headbang to."
"Opeth - When","MAYH definitely my top Opeth album"
"Opeth - When","Ah, my first Opeth album, favourite to this date."
"Opeth - When","I agree. While their later albums like Watershed and Deliverance are still great, I doubt any band, including Opeth, will ever create something as amazing as My Arms Your Hearse again. I still think Blackwater Park and Still Life are pretty close behind this album though. "
"Opeth - When","I think My Arms Your Hearse is one of the better sounding albums I've heard, mastering-wise. The way the guitar tracks blend together, drums, incredible vocals. The compositions are great, but coupled with the amazing sound... you might just be right. Something better might never happen. I might be biased though, sentiment and stuff.

The other albums are close, true, Still Life being almost there (Godhead's Lament!). Anyway, I'm pretty sure Opeth can't succeed in making a bad album :) I absolutely like the way their music evolves, which might be the reason that although my music tastes changed over the years, Opeth was always around.

One of the best bands in history for sure.
"
"Opeth - When","I think the only thing that I don't love about this album is its mastering. Sorry, but I think Steven Wilson's sound is much better suited for Opeth. It's much more dynamic."
"Opeth - When","What works for me in MAYH is they took the harmonies they always had to the next level and made them sound exceptional using ""only"" mastering. I mean, I can easily distinguish individual guitar tracks in their later albums (which is good!) but there's something unique about MAYH guitars that makes them sound *great* together, even though they ""blend"" so much. Still dynamic, still have power, they're just different compared to newer albums, or any band at their time.

Whether it was deliberate or not is another story -- I don't know, and don't really care. I just love the way the album sounds. Again, I might be biased due to my sentiment.

Either way, MAYH is an album that really shows that Opeth didn't settle for dull metal of the 90's. They're always ahead :)
"
"Opeth - When","I had a really good system in my car, before it was stolen. 2x10 alpine subs in an infinity band pass box and 800 watt dual channel Rockford fosgate amp powering it. I cranked up my car only to hear the intro to this song. Bowu Ba nu nah... Then the screaming and double bass kicked in, and I almost shit my pants. I had apparently let the riff play once and turned my car off leaving me only one play through of the acoustic part. I'll never forget that absolute fear from music. Still makes me smile to this day. "

"Opeth - When","The unseen Akerfeldt is the deadliest."
"Opeth - When","Ahhh the memories I have attached to this album."

"Opeth - When","That must've been one popular guy."
"Opeth - When","This is the song that got me into Opeth..holds a special place. "
"Opeth - When","i dunno.....Akerfeldt's vox are too gutteral or clean...LAME.SELLOUT.NOT AS GOOD AS WHAT I WANT TO PREFER.

"Polyrhythmic Movements Over a Groove (Troy Wright demoing various divisions over Physical Education)","Just though it was cool the methodical way he goes through a bunch of different feels. I know when I feel stuck or like I've run out of ideas when writing (sadly, programming) drum parts, it can be fun to try to find a different beat unit to emphasize, see if it brings out the groove in a better way."
"Polyrhythmic Movements Over a Groove (Troy Wright demoing various divisions over Physical Education)","There's something viscerally satisfying about polyrhythms. Thanks for this"
"Polyrhythmic Movements Over a Groove (Troy Wright demoing various divisions over Physical Education)","Troy's a beast of a drummer. He does some pretty intense polysomethings in this one - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHb8iZvwJ5w
As a guitarist I have to say, drummers are the best."
"Polyrhythmic Movements Over a Groove (Troy Wright demoing various divisions over Physical Education)","Eww that was FRESH. Eric's face at 3:15 is freakin' hilarious!"
"Polyrhythmic Movements Over a Groove (Troy Wright demoing various divisions over Physical Education)","Breaking this down in my head finally helped me understand polymeter vs. polyrhythm. (I like polymeter better.)"
"Polyrhythmic Movements Over a Groove (Troy Wright demoing various divisions over Physical Education)","If I understand correctly, those are polymeters because they're all in 4/4, just not necessarily in some common beat like half note or quarter note. If it was some 5/8 against 4/4 feel then it would be polymeter.

If all this is correct then for me polyrhythm is waaaaay more hard to ""get"" than polymeters. Those come more easily for me"
"Polyrhythmic Movements Over a Groove (Troy Wright demoing various divisions over Physical Education)","Polyrhythm is such a misnomer in this genre. If you had a 4/4-5/4 polyrhythm, the duration of both would exist in the same measure. They would essentially be at different tempos. This would be hard to make musical and near impossible for one drummer to accomplish."
"Polyrhythmic Movements Over a Groove (Troy Wright demoing various divisions over Physical Education)","It's difficult, but not super impossible. You're absolutely right about the durations of polyrhythms occurring in the same space, I would just veer away from notating it as a 4/4 - 5/4 polyrhythm, since using time signatures implies you're talking about polymeter. Usually for polyrhythm I've seen it as 4:5.

I'm just expanding further on what you're getting at here, if people are still curious more about the concept. '2 against 3' being the most common polyrhythm, where even eighths occur simultaneously with eighth note triplets, so the first of the even eighths and the first of the triplets would line up every beat. Impressionist piano music for example loves that shit, gives a great fluid texture.

In your example, 4 against 5 would be 4 quarter notes (we'll make them quarters for clarity's sake) at the same time as 5 dotted eighth notes. After 4 beats, both cells would be back to their beginning. This isn't particularly difficult for a pianist or drummer or something to accomplish. Granted, it gets much harder quickly as you work with smaller subdivisions, e.g. 4 sixteenths vs. 5 quintuplets is a pain, I just kind of mash 'em together and make sure the beats line up, usually too fast to worry about exact precision, usually just for texture anyway.

 Key idea being that polyrhythms are different subdivisions (creating different speeds for the two cells) that line up on repetition, while polymeters are equal length notes, just varying numbers of notes in the patterns (5/4 and a 4/4) causes desynchronization of starting point.

EDIT: /u/Something_Unclever is got this shit under control, I just wrote a ton of words to muddy the waters ;) 

Can be frustratingly tricky to describe the difference textually, been thinking of making a video with examples outlining the differences and how to recognize various patterns. Also would want to delve into common compositional methods to truncate or extend patterns to make 'em line up all pretty to 4/4 or whatever (10/4 if you're Ow My Feelings)"
"Polyrhythmic Movements Over a Groove (Troy Wright demoing various divisions over Physical Education)","Not drumming but still, got some nice 5:3 patterns in there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCFlVAavwOU"
"Polyrhythmic Movements Over a Groove (Troy Wright demoing various divisions over Physical Education)","So then (based on this and /u/Michael_Caine's reply below) I was wrong and/or the video is mislabeled? 

You're right that it would be difficult for ""one drummer"" to pull off, but when I think of poly*rhythm* (as you stated it) I think of multiple instruments, say a guitarist and a drummer but the guitar is playing in 4/4 at one tempo and the drums are in 3/4 at another tempo so that the measures sync up. Whereas a poly*meter*, according to your description, would be the guitarist and drummer having equal quarter note length so that three measure of 4/4 for the guitarist syncs with four measures of 3/4 for the drummer. (This would be much easier to pull off on solo drums and is essentially what is being done in the video.)"
"Polyrhythmic Movements Over a Groove (Troy Wright demoing various divisions over Physical Education)","I usually avoid thinking of polyrhythm as instruments playing in *different* meters and different tempos, it's usually the same meter, just being subdivided in different groupings (e.g. - subdividing into triplets vs. sixteenths), that's why polyrhythm makes sense to use a ratio notation rather than metric. 

Polymeter more has to do with desynchronization caused by different lengths of *phrases*, where a 5-note quarter note pattern will gradually offset if played simultaneously with a 4-note quarter note pattern, even though they have the same individual beat rhythmic values.

In the video, the Physical education groove is always 4/4, and technically Troy keeps playing in 4/4, he just changes the subdivision of the cymbal stack hits, which is why they change speeds, so it is indeed polyrhythm.

Like I had mentioned, super annoying to describe purely verbally. There was a link I've referred to a bunch of times in the past when trying to be clear with writing about it, let me see if I can quick grab it.

EDIT: [This link has a couple very clear visual examples](http://music.stackexchange.com/questions/10488/polymeter-vs-polyrhythm)"

"Polyrhythmic Movements Over a Groove (Troy Wright demoing various divisions over Physical Education)","Yeah, some work better with the groove than others, but it blows my mind when people have the comfortable-ish facility to switch it up like that. Like, when you're writing parts, how do you decide which feel to go with?! So many options! "

"Periphery joining In Flames and All That Remains for Spring North American Tour","I may be the only person who doesn't dislike their newer stuff. I were a bit disappointed at first but it has grown on me. I feel a lot more connected to the albums as a whole when listening to their new music (3 latest) versus their old. It's hard to explain but when u listen to their old stuff I find these ""Holy shit this is a good song"" and in their new there's more a ""Holy shit this makes sense"". 

For example Take This Life is a real killer song but Paralyzed from their newest album is a wonderful song which fits perfectly with the rest of the album. "
"Periphery joining In Flames and All That Remains for Spring North American Tour","Well I have to admit I haven't given Siren Charms many spins. There are no original members left after the departure of Jesper so I suppose it was inevitable that there would be a drastic shift in style. I thought Deliver Us was an incredibly strong track from SOAPF, but I was disappointed in the rest of the album. Siren Charms seemed to be a bit of the same stuff so I just didn't have the patience for it. I, unlike many IF fans, did quite enjoy A Sense of Purpose"

I'm sure there may have been some irresolute feelings and and a few unanswered questions regarding my departure from the band last year, but for everyone who supported Polyphia and me individually in spite of that, I deeply thank you, and assure you to know that all of your love and support did not go unnoticed. Alongside all of the soul searching, and everything I had the privilege to experience in my time away, one of the biggest things that got me through it all and brought me back home was the love and support from all of you out there who believe in us and what we do, and for that, I am very grateful and excited to reciprocate that gratitude to all of you with the music we will make from here, forward.

"Has anyone else checked out Beardfish's new album, ""+4626 Comfortzone""?","Their new album just came out in Europe, today. It's up on YouTube and various torrent sites already. Gave it listen through on YouTube earlier and it was decent. Nothing particularly struck me. I actually really liked their second to most recent album, The Void, and I love everything else before that. Slightly let down, but I'll have to listen to it a few more times before I make up my mind."
"Has anyone else checked out Beardfish's new album, ""+4626 Comfortzone""?","Like you said, I find it just okay.  But one listen isn't really enough.  It seems pretty similar to the void compositionally, but stylistically less heavy. It just doesn't stand out like Destined Solitaire, the Sane Day, and Sleeping in Traffic(s) managed to on first listen.  Instrumentally it's pretty awesome, but it just feels like it's missing some important, indescribable element that Beardfish is known for. I've felt this way about the previous two albums as well."

Full disclosure....i am now 44 however i am not too old as the saying goes.  I love loud music but when i have paid money to see a band play i want to be able to hear the damn music not a vast group of locusts attacking the venue!
I want to go to shows but i am seriously considering not going anymore.  
I have been to so many concerts in my life since my dad was the ticket manager for a big entertainment venue while i was young so i know what loud is and what completely distorted hell is!!!!!

It isn't about, ""drowning out the crowd"" as some people on here have suggested. It's about the sound guy being deaf / not giving a proper fuck about the audience. Their goal is to show off their sound system, to see what it can do. Their goal ought to be making the show more enjoyable. If anyone in the crowd is even conscious of the sound guy being there, something is wrong with the whole situation.

My hypotheses for this is that they either have the sound mixed for the headlining band and can't be bothered to change it up for the openers, bigger bands have their own sound engineer/ actually care what they sound like, or they just fluke out and the staff at the venues literally don't give a shit how the bands sound and just care about your money."

He just drowned out the vocals, the first band's sound suffered hugely as a result. The headliner (YOB) were experienced enough to stop and tell him to turn everything down and the vocals up through each monitor which solved everything. I'm inclined to agree that some sound guys are just assholes and bands need to know how to handle them."
"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","That's pretty much it. Also, depending on the show, they also come in with their own gear sometimes, I mean, the opening act's playing through some shitty Chinese brand 24 channel desk from 1992 while the headliner's got some crazy modern digital desk with racks of all sorts of audio goodies. When my band was opening for a big band, we got a pretty awesome desk(I'm not sure if we shared it with the headliner), but our sound guy was specifically instructed by the promoter, the headliner's management and the headliner's sound guy that the SPL was not to exceed a certain amount. Anything above that all the way to what was deemed safe was reserved for the headliner. So yes, headliners get priority. After all, that's what you're paying to see. "

"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","So here's the deal: some sound guys understand the equipment they're using. They know how to operated it and that's about it. They may even have been a musician at one point.

The difference between an ok sound guy and a good one is their knowledge of the room's acoustics and the affect the music is supposed to achieve when played to the audience. If the sound guy doesn't understand these concepts you will have shitty unbalanced overblown sound every time. 

The music needs to be louder the bigger the room is so that the furthest listening spot still has adequate volume levels. However this needs to be taken into consideration compared to the area right in front of the speakers or in front of the stage. Not only does the amplitude change but the quality of the sound changes, too. 

The decent sound guy has been in the space enough and has monkeyed with the equipment to find this balance throughout the room. Great sound guys can estimate this from venue to venue based on experience. 

Now on the listener end, you have to understand standing right up near the stage is going to be ridiculously loud if the venue is big. Even if it's a smaller venue the musical affect the performers are trying to achieve may require a higher volume to make the music resonate (literally) In the listeners' bodies and minds. Think really low bass notes or in heavier music the chugga chugga of palm muted guitar. This sound wave literally moves you. Quite the feeling. Very enjoyable if you have earplugs. 

So as much as it is a frustration for you there are just a lot of elements in live sound that can go wrong that aren't necessary related to the sound guy. All of this still doesn't take into consideration the instruments and equipment settings of the musicians, which could also cause problems if they are set up in such a way that doesn't work well with the space. There's only so much a sound guy can do without telling the musicians that their stuff just sounds bad so then some form of compensation has to be made, unfortunately this can result in further problems. 

Earplugs are a good idea anyway but they definitely aren't the only fix to the issue and they may not be the best. 

Try different places in the room. Try talking with the sound guy (if your ever get the chance- maybe in small venues) and see if they're hearing the same thing as you. They will probably tell you to duck off (I'm leaving the typo) but some guys haven't been jaded by people telling them the sound is shit and will take the advice if it is presented in a reasonable fashion. 

But all of this is only my own experience and is more from the performance side as well as the listener/audience side. I know a few sound guys and have had conversations with them about it but it isn't indicative of all scenarios. 

Also, before you try to correct my usage of affect, please look it up when concerning musical performance; affect is correct. :)"

"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","I'll just put up the disclaimer that I'm not a sound guy but I've worked around them enough to know the basics and logistics of how and why they make decisions. Here's my two cents as someone who works in the production industry:

- First - and I know like 30 other people have said it, but it can't be overstated - always wear ear protection. Unless you're watching an acoustic jazz trio or a singer songwriter at a coffee shop you have to protect your ears. If you get decent plugs (NOT the yellow/green foam ones) they can also actually affect the levels of the sound so everything comes through clearer. I hear a lot of people gripe about sound at shows that I've thought sounded fine. Difference? Plugs. With that out of the way, lets move on to some of the other issues.

- Position in the room - Please take into consideration your positioning in the room relative to the sound system. The audio engineer's job is to make sound loud enough to cover the whole room while setting the mix to sound best AT THE POINT OF THE BOARD. The board is usually 30-50 feet from stage indoors and 75-90 feet from stage outdoors. If you're standing in the first row, this might be why you only hear bass. Subs are generally ground stacked in front of or on the sides of the stage while the PA or line array is flown higher to get better room coverage. It's entirely possible that you're missing the high end because it's shooting over your head. This is the fault of the VENUE and not the engineer. Venues don't want to pay another $5-8000 to get proper sound right in front of the stage because the majority of the crowd is covered (and usually those up front are people enamored enough with the band not to care).

- Touring engineers - As others have mentioned sound systems and acoustics vary from venue to venue, and it can take a lot of experience in one specific room to make it sound good. However, touring bands usually bring a sound engineer with them. This creates all sorts of little issues because they're not familiar with the room and possibly the equipment. Usually tour engineers are seasoned enough to work their way around most problems, but unknown factors do occur. Is there a balcony in the back? Usually that traps quite a bit of sound and they boost to compensate. If the venue has a digital board they're not familiar with it can take them longer to perform somewhat simple tasks. Just keep in mind that they're probably not sitting on their hands back there.

- Stage volume - A lot of bands want to crank their shit to 11 on stage. This can create some real sonic problems because the engineer has to be able to mix the sound for the back half of the room while the front half gets blasted by both PA and stage amps. By the time the stage audio gets to the back it's gone through 100 rows of bodies and pretty much negated itself so they only hear the PA, but the front half is saying ""WHY THE FUCK IS THIS SO LOUD MY EYES ARE LITERALLY MELTING!!!"".

There are a lot of factors that go into the decisions that sound guys make and the answer can't always be to ""turn it down"". They have to make sure the whole room gets coverage (it's actually in most contracts). That said, if you're hearing actual audio clipping and distortion, that's probably because the venue's system sucks ass and they did want to pay for someone to come in and beef it up a bit so it could handle the load.

TL;DR: There's more at work here than the sound guy."
"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","I agree and i dont want to be that guy that just blames the sound guy.
I do know that we need something better with all of the electronics out there and the scientific knowledge.  
The fact that a place can say ""hey play here"" and thats all it takes is ridiculous and unfair to the bands that have to make their way by touring.  They just want to be heard and this is the translation they get.  Marble mumbo jumbo!!!
Maybe i am too old but damn i do love loud music that you feel so maybe i can come up with something to make this world better."
"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","Well, I am 24 and have been feeling like you about this for ever. I commonly use earplugs at shows. 

However, I really like the power of all the acoustic waves hitting you outside and inside. I like to feel the bass in my stomach, and the kick drum. And I think it would be really underwhelming to go see a show that just plays quietly.

It's true that it sometimes is badly mixed, but a well-mixed, loud enough concert is just awesome. Then, it should be warned that the sound can cause ear damage, and earplugs should be distributed for free at the entry, for those who don't have their own."

"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","I do live sound for a living, and I think there are many things in your post that you're not taking into account. First of all, if a band is very loud, it's not necessarily the sound guys fault. Quite often if a band is too loud and the vocals are muddy, it's because the band themselves are too loud without any PA reinforcement. Full drum kits and guitar stacks are very loud instruments, and sometimes they compete with each other to the point that they become an unruly mess. 

I've dealt with bands who were playing with 2 Fender 4x10 combo amps for each player, totaling to 6 amps. If you have any experience with Fender combos, they're staggeringly loud, even with the volume set to moderate levels. The band I was mixing for had all of their amps on 9, which is unheard of for a room I was mixing in (500-600 cap venue). This, in turn, made it so that no matter how loud I turned up the vocal in the PA, the guitars would still drown them out. I asked the band to turn down, and they wouldn't. With the PA hitting limit (as loud as it can possibly go), the vocals just couldn't compete. 

I assume this is a common problem in metal, especially so with the mentality that metal has to be a loud genre. That, in itself, is another point to take into consideration. You keep bringing up symphony concerts and jazz gigs for things that are a respectable volume. If you ask any person on the street which is going to be loudest between a symphony, jazz, or metal concert, we all know that the metal show is going to be common answer. My point here is that if a band is really that bad sounding, either A. talk to the band and let them know that they're too loud. Many bands want a good sounding show just as much as you do. Or, B. if the band has a touring FOH engineer, talk to them. Sometimes they'll just write you off, but you never know. 


Something else that can be an issue, especially with the muddy vocals, is improper mic technique. I've seen SO MANY metal vocalists who have horrible mic technique. This can cause muddiness, thinness, or general lack of volume overall. This, along with cymbal and guitar bleed in the vocal mic can ruin an otherwise acceptable vocal performance.


On top of that, some bands are just plain hard to mix. The other night I was filling in at FOH for a friends band at a local venue. They play instrumental, synth-filled prog. There were 3 bands before them, 2 indie and one pop-punk (it was a strange show). The first 3 bands all shared a drum kit. That kit was so easy to mix, and so well tuned that I didn't really have to do much to get a great mixing going with it. Then came the headliner. No matter how much I tried, I could NOT get that drum set to sound good. The toms had no attack, weird resonances, and a general muddiness without a perceivable tone throughout. The snare was super loud (even unmic'd), and the cymbals were crazy harsh and loud. I could only get the kick to a useable sound. The guitar sounded OK, but the guitarist had an axe-fx and didn't have pretty much any of his sounds level-matched, so I had to ride his fader all night. The bassist's tone was fairly thin and honky, and EQing the honk out took away all of the character and intelligibility of the instrument. All of this on top of a very harsh backing track made for the mess you've been describing. So, sometimes it comes down to badly tuned/maintained instruments and mediocre players. No matter how hard the guy at FOH will try, the band will sound like a mess.


Lastly, you've been saying you don't want to wear earplugs, and while you're obviously free to not wear them or not *want* to wear them, it's becoming extremely commonplace to do so. If you get a nice pair of [These Earplugs](http://www.amazon.com/Etymotic-Research-ETY-Plugs-Protection-Earplugs/dp/B0044DEESS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425329697&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ER-20), I guarantee you that you will be able to hear the band clearly. They take away all of the harsh high end and shitty, muddy boxiness that can cloud a mix. Added to that, PAs are becoming more powerful and efficient pretty much by the year. The days of yore where a PA was strictly for the vocals, and eventually the vocals, kick drum, and keys are essentially gone. You can pump pretty much as many dB into a venue as you see fit for a fraction of the price, space, and weight than ever before. Sure, some people may take this too far and generally mix far too loud, but I assure you that there are plenty of sound people just trying to do the best with what they're given, be it bad players, bad instruments, loud bands, and bad singers. 


TL;DR: Don't just blame it on the sound guy, man. Some of of genuinely care and want the show to be as awesome as possible."

Furthermore if it sounds shitty, turning it up to bleeding levels is not the answer.  I know you know this and I'm sure plenty of sound men would agree in saying that their profession is full of idiots.
Yes i have been comparing the jazz and orchestral shows but in all honesty how many of us would rather hear the show instead of cower away!!!
It isn't simple i know.
But when in doubt don't turn it up.

Im hoping that some musicians will see this and try not to be so loud on their own.  Quit competing for sound on the stage and listen to your sound man (if you have hired a good one)

Just because Scale the Summit has their own sound man doesn't mean he is smart.  He may know what he is doing but when the room won't allow you to turn it up that loud then you shouldn't because you only hurt the band!!!"

The Contortionist is one of my favorite bands and both times I've seen them (at different venues) the sound has been so blown out that I had trouble hearing the parts even though I know them by heart. I'm really butthurt about it in regards to that band especially, since they are one of my favorites and they focus so much on dynamics and ambience. But almost every metal show I go to is like this. Fuck hearing any metal band for the first time live, I can't tell what the fuck is going on in the song if I don't know it before the show. I'm not sure if the sound guys think they're entitled to crank everything because it's a metal show or what, but this bugs the piss out of me too. "

I saw Scale the Summit with Fair to Midland (and others) and everyone's volume was fine until Fair to Midland came out. Either they didn't do a sound check or their sound engineer is Helen Keller.

The place was an old church and it was painful.  I stuck paper towels in my ears.
There was a point that toward the end the crowd was getting into it and head banging a little when the sound guy thought it would be a good idea and turn it up even louder and everyone stopped moving and couldn't get into it!    I saw it.

Thats like making your steering wheel out of knives and the solution would be to wear a vest to protect yourself!!!"
"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","Wearing ear plugs is a trade off for having music that causes a physical reaction. Want your chest to shake every time they hit the kick drum? Probably should wear plugs. On top of that they help to even out the frequency response from both speakers and subs so less of the sound gets muddled. Frequencies have a tendency to override each other creating a ""muddy"" sound where you can't distinguish one instrument over another. Plugs help to reduce this muddiness to give you more clarity (good plugs at least).

Also, wouldn't you want, like, gauntlets for a steering wheel like that?"
"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","This. Also with tube amplifiers for guitar and bass it's basically required for them to be loud before those vacuum tubes have enough juice behind them so they don't sound cold/sterile. It's annoying but it's the truth for high wattage amplifiers (which have some physical differences in their transformers/types of vacuum tubes they use that have a very real effect on their sound). "
"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","In some cases the gain knob also acts as a volume for tube amplifiers, so they have to be set at a certain level before they provide the desired distortion."

"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","""Harsh and raw"" might work for an indie band or your typical rock/metal band.
Because their gear might be a bit warm, muddy, and not cutting through.

Most prog/metal bands have a crunchy harsh compressed tone that cuts through already.
From the kick drum up to the vocalist.  

An example is the bands who use axefx.  Usually the guitar sounds thin, tinny, or just way to loud in a live setting.  Which is what most bands who go for a prog/djent/metal sound use nowadays.

Not shitting on the gear in anyway, but I certainly wouldn't mix those bands with the thought that this needs to be more ""harsh and raw"".

I understand not wanting to wear earplugs, but the fact of the matter is that wearing them will solve your problem 90% of the time.

"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","as a former sound guy, I used to struggle with this as well, especially in smaller venues. When you're a house guy and the guitarists have their amps turned up to 11, there isn't much you can do. You can ask the guys to turn it down so that you can have a better chance to mix and balance, but that could be a longshot given on the personalities at play.

What you have to take into account as well is that headliners always sound check first, and usually, for as long as they want. So this means that openers have to deal with a board/system that's already mixed and can't really fuck that up. This is where you'll usually find that openers sound like shit compared to headliners; it's just a result of show politics."

"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","It's not always the sound guy's fault. Plenty of bands playing in small venues will have guitarists who insist on turning it up to eleven and bleeding out your ears all on their own. All a sound guy can do at that point is try to compensate. Really though, standard volume for rock and metal shows in the US is too loud to safely endure without ear plugs or filters."
"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","I would say the problem lies more in balancing the mix.  Metal in general has a crazy low end that is very difficult to control.  "
"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","While I do agree that sometimes its hard to pick out the instruments, you have to look at it from the sound guy and band's perspective. If it's too quiet the crowd drowns out the band and that would be awful. The sound guy also has a responsibility to make the band sound the way that they want to. It is difficult for some sound guys to get a good, consistent sound every night because some of them are using a different mixing board every night. Also, every venue is different, so they're dealing with an entirely new acoustic environment."
"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","One band I saw, and enjoyed live, was Meshuggah at The Marque Theater in Tempe AZ. They were not attacking my ears and brain with a terrible wall of cacophony. I have tinnitus bad, and I'm starting to wear plugs at band practice now, and when I go to concerts, or gigs. Maybe it was the sound guy was on point, or Meshuggah's own crew?

At smaller venues like The Mesa Underground, beneath the Nile Theater in Mesa AZ, the sound is always terrible. Saw Glass Cloud, and they were great, however. But I could not stand Scale the Summit. They were WAY too loud, especially for an instrumental band. Their cleans pierced my ears!

For Periphery's Juggernaut tour, they plaid in a new venue for Club Red. Big and spacious, maybe the sound guys weren't used to the acoustics yet, but that entire show was fucking loud as shit. Especially standing stage right by the huge ass stacks. Woven War was god awful. Their vocals were way too loud, couldn't hear any instruments, and they left my left ear numb and buzzing. The drummer was the only entertaining part. Periphery rocked, but, as any headliner in the same vein, it's hard to hear with the crowd so loud. Not to mention the damage done by the open acts on my ears. I've seen Periphery before, and they are always mixed beautifully by Alex Markides. In small venues like Joes Grotto, and even spacious ones like The Venue of Scottsdale.

TL;DR: Some, or most headliners have a crew who know what they are doing. Sometimes it's the crappy venue. But I agree, let's fix this shit, as a musician, having tinnitus sucks, and could become a problem. Thanks inconsiderate sound engineers!"

"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","Yeah, a local venue here in salt lake city has ruined countless shows for me.

Even with earplugs it was just terrible mixing.
I had to feel like an asshole with my hands over my ears to even attempt to have a clear picture of what they were playing.
Which is hugely disappointing, cause they are so amazing live, especially with their newer line up.
This is a smaller venue and these bands don't bring in people in droves, but that isn't an excuse to not have a decent engineer.

I've only been to a small handful of shows there where the sound actually had a decent balance. And I've seen way more than just metal bands there, I saw a local indie band there a couple weeks ago and couldn't hear a word out of the vocalist's mouth because the kick drum and snare were so damn high.

I've been to a lot of great metal shows with excellent engineers at the helm. I've also been to a few where the only thing you could hear was a rolling wall of bassy noise and indecipherable clashing mid to high end. Yuck.

Problem is the venues I think. Metal shows aren't expected to draw very heavy crowds. That's not always the case, obviously, but that's the reasoning at work when the owners of the venue decide that instead of paying a quality engineer for that particular show they'll give that untested kid who's been begging for a job a shot that day instead. Because he's practically going to work for free.

It also has to do with metal being the odd man out when it comes to *how* it should be engineered. A lot of guys who do perfectly fine when it comes to engineering a live country, rock, pop, rap, etc. mix have no idea what to do with a sonically dense super compressed metal mix. In their minds, based on the one or two albums they listened to before the show, metalheads obviously like it loud and distorted so ""lets just crank it up."""

"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","Our main venue here has cement floors and brick walls with no sound absorption materials of any kind.  They crank it up so loud you can't make sense of any instrument.  Even an Opeth concert during acoustic interludes are washed out by sound waves just being bounced around everywhere."
"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","A lot of the time it has to do with additive mixing practices (can't hear it?  Turn up what you can't hear vs turn down masking elements) but some of it is out of the hands of the engineer.  Amps, etc, on stage are usually turned up to a ridiculous level and you are competing with them, and if the band uses wedge monitors instead of in-ears you're going to compete with those suckers blasting at 100dB+ for the band as well."
"Who is sick of going to see a band play and the sound guy has it turned up so loud that you cannot discern any instrument from the other??!!","I still think its great that some bands don't make it big, because you easily see them live without fear of it selling out in an hour, they wont be crazy expensive and its not going to be filled with morons just going to see what band everyone is talking about.
However with these shitty venues they have to play at and the lack of sound quality that the owners wont care about since it will cost more money im starting to think that we are in a catch 22.  
I wouldnt mind to pay more if i knew the sound would be good.
The Contortionist, Fallujah, Revocation and Toothgrinder all for 16 dollars is a freakin' steal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I would've paid triple!!!
So for that i am grateful.
Especially since the singer for Toothgrinder fell down trying to climb up the balcony....pretty entertaining.

Listen, if we dont speak up, then this will keep happening, sound guys wont do their jobs right, bands will keep being selfish with their instruments and how loud they want them and shitty venues will keep making money.  
This ""metal"" mentality that many people have is foolish!!!  There are plenty of metal fans that are intelligent and want great sound and would rather get what they paid for.
I keep hearing ""If its too loud your too old""  I'm sick of it!!!!

"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","I'm really disappointed. Somebody expressed that he doesn't like Periphery's new record. For whatever reasons. Doesn't matter. That's not why I'm upset. What I really don't like is that every single one of his comments in the thread was downvoted to at least -5. This is not how I know this sub, normally we have proper discussions about our different tastes without having to downvote somebody who doesn't agree with our tastes. I think it's really childish and simply not what this sub should represent, which is a community with many different tastes, with the common factor that we like progressive metal. If our tastes diverge, we talk about why they do, what we like about a band and what we don't like about them, and then understand that different people have different tastes. No need to be negativ about anything. At least this is what I would like the sub to be."

The guy wasn't saying they suck and should be murdered, he just found the new stuff poppier (in however he perceives it) and it doesn't have to affect anyone else's opinions on the music.

"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","This has always been a big problem with the internet. One guy states an opinion likes it's a fact, another guy disagrees, 10 page long argument ensues.

"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","Well, I always thought this subreddit to be above that in a sense."
"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","Look on the bright side - it only happens in Periphery threads."
"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","Was it his opinion that people were down voting? Or the way he expressed it/ was he making valid points or just saying blatantly untrue things? "
"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","This is approaching the crux of the issue. He/she was doing the ol' ""my opinions are the indisputable facts of the matter"" style of writing, rather than presenting opinions in a way that would foster discussion instead of kneejerk retorts and downvotes. Absolute statements are almost never going to result in pleasant exchanges.

I've had differing opinions on a lot of things around here, and I'm certainly capable of being a bit tactless in some of my postings, and those are the ones that get the most (deserved) flack. On the other hand, when I keep my tone non-aggressive and, you know, leave room for people to have different thoughts, I've gotten some great in-depth responses, even when we have irreconcilable differences of opinion (e.g. - had a huge multi-day argument about Pink Lemonade that still managed to end on a good note). 

EDIT: Misspelled 'aggressive' like some sort of Neanderthal. Fixed it."
"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","I believe it was the guy who said that Juggernaut was Periphery's least progressive album. I agree with him in the true sense of prog, but it definitely fits under the prog label.

He then went on to describe the album as pop metal. 

It's pretty obvious why he got downvoted."
"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","Albeit, he probably should've expressed his opinion a little more gently, but he isn't necessarily wrong in my eyes."
"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","My issue was that he seemed incapable of saying anything beyond those points. Saying it's pop metal is fine, but what makes it 'pop'? I'm assuming it's the flamboyant vocals, but that was never brought up. He just kept saying pop metal and listing some songs over and over. He also kept saying P2 was more progressive, but couldn't seem to expand on that point either. Differing opinions are fine and can lead to some awesome discussion, but you should be able to explain what about the music makes you feel that way."
"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","Some of those posts deserved downvotes. Not all of them, but some. "
"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","Honestly, *in my humble opinion* (urgh), I kind of agreed with the guy, at least if you look at Juggernaut: Alpha, a lot of the songs aren't *that* proggy on it. And if you like proggy music, that's probably a negative. From what I've gathered, a lot of people on here do in fact prefer Omega, which is the *proggier* of the two albums.

Heck, if you, for example, go on the [sputnikmusic page for Periphery](http://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/Periphery/11436/), Omega has a higher user score - I'm willing to bet that's partially because a lot of prog fans listen to Periphery, and a lot of them found Alpha a bit less appetising than Omega. I know I did.

But they're both neat albums so whatever. Omega was on perma listen for me last week. I think it's weird that they released two albums at the same time but it again, kind of emphasises the dissonance between the two - the fact that Juggernaut wasn't one single album.

I think the dude probably suffered from neg inflation."
"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","Okay um,

1. I don't think it was his opinion that was downvoted, it was more the fact that he came into a Periphery thread about something Periphery achieved to badmouth Periphery. While it's completely valid to dislike the band, his comment wasn't really constructive and had a derailing influence on the thread.

2. I don't like Periphery either, in fact I don't consider them to be prog at all, at any point in their existence, so it's really annoying that of late this subreddit has been infested with their fans and bloated with posts centred on the band, when better artists could have more exposure. They're a pop rock band. They do not belong on this subreddit.

3. Nonetheless, I have taken the road of just ignoring them. I don't think going into Periphery threads and shitposting is a good way to express anything."
"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","&gt; While it's completely valid to dislike the band

I don't dislike the band, they are in my top 5. I was just expressing my disappointment with juggernaut. I even said I would prefer they make music they want to, rather than music which will please fans of the old albums. But that still doesn't make me like juggernaut and that's all I'm saying"

It's those types of statements that have a ""derailing influence"" on a thread, because you seem to be stating your opinion as fact.

You are obviously entitled to express your opinion, but if you aren't careful about how you write said opinion, then what could have been a constructive discussion turns into a classic internet argument."

"Regarding the discussion on the Periphery Billboard thread...","I kinda agree with what he says. It's definitely not as wanky as past Periphery records and some of the songs are simpler. That doesn't mean the prog and wank aren't there though. What's bothering me the most is when people are talking about Alpha and Omega in absolutes. It's Alpha is shit pop metal (wtf does that even mean) and Omega is Dj0nthurrderr. There's shit on both of the records that's all over the place. There is content for everybody here. "

---

&gt;

&gt;The [Canadian federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada) does not regulate pit bull-type dogs, but one provincial government and some [municipal governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_government) in Canada have enacted breed-specific legislation banning or restricting pit bull-type dogs. The following table discusses a sampling of the restrictions in force.

&gt;In *Cochrane v. Ontario (Attorney General)*, 2007 CanLII 9231 (ON S.C.), Ms. Catherine Cochrane sued the [Province of Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario) to prevent it from enforcing the Dog Owner's Liability Act (DOLA) ban on pit bull-type dogs, arguing that the law was unconstitutionally broad because the ban was grossly disproportionate to the risk pit bulls pose to public safety, and that the law was unconstitutionally vague because failed to provide an intelligible definition of pit bulls. She also argued that a provision allowing [the Crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown) to introduce as evidence a veterinarian’s certificate certifying that the dog is a pit bull violates the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence.
The presiding judge ruled that the DOLA was not overbroad because,

&gt;&gt;


&gt;""The evidence with respect to the dangerousness of pit bulls, although conflicting and inconclusive, is sufficient, in my opinion, to constitute a 'reasoned apprehension of harm'. In the face of conflicting evidence as to the feasibility of less restrictive means to protect the public, it was open to the legislature to decide to restrict the ownership of all pit bulls."" 

&gt;The presiding judge found the term ""a pit bull terrier"" was unconstitutionally vague since it could include an undefined number of dogs similar to the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier.  The judge also ruled that the government's ability to introduce a veterinarian’s certificate certifying that the dog is a pit bull created a mandatory presumption that the dog was a pit bull, and that this placed an unconstitutional burden of proof upon the defendant. 

&gt;Ms. Cochrane and the Attorney General of Ontario [appealed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal) different aspects of the decision to the [Court of Appeal for Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario).  In *Cochrane v. Ontario* (2008 ONCA 718), the Court of Appeal reversed the lower court's ruling:

&gt;


&gt;* It agreed with the lower court judge in finding that the “overbreadth” claim failed because the legislature had acted on a “reasonable apprehension of harm.”

&gt;* It disagreed that the definition of pit bull in the Act was insufficiently precise and restored the original wording of ""pit bull terrier"" on the basis that, when read in the context of “a more comprehensive definition,” the phrasing “a pit bull terrier” was sufficiently precise.

&gt;* It reversed the trial court and found that the government's ability to introduce a veterinarian's certificate certifying a dog was a pit bull would constitute proof only if the defendant failed to answer the claim: it was therefore a tactical burden, rather an evidentiary burden. 

&gt;On June 11, 2009 the [Supreme Court of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada) declined to hear further appeal of the case, thereby upholding the Ontario ban on pit bulls.

&gt;RW: Well first of all, pit bulls are a mutt breed. And there are a ton of myths that exist that have been perpetuated by media. You know? It’s just not feasible or right that they could ban and put to death any breed of dog in this country, and the fact that we have the largest territory in all of the world that does that – puts to death thousands of dogs every year – and this is put in place to stop dog attacks? It’s not. It’s not doing anything at all. I’m not just saying with this that we need to do away with the ban and wash our hands of it, because then nothing’s going to happen. We have to look at Calgary’s model. If you look at Ontario in 2005 when they put the ban in place, there was about 5000 dog attacks, or dog bites, sorry. In 2009 after all those years of BSL (Breed Specific Legislation) there was still over 5000 dog bites. Now when we look at Calgary, in 2005 they had about 2000 dog bites. In 2009 because of this new model that puts ownership more on the actual owner – there’s higher penalties, it’s harder to license a dog, it’s harder to get a dog. There’s education in the school systems. In 2009 they had just over 100 dog bites. This is a model that is in place and it’s working. In Ontario, we have a model that’s not only putting innocent dogs to death, but it’s not working. It’s costly and it’s ineffective. It’s costing tax payers more money than they even realize, and it’s a myth! The girl who lived beneath me in the last house that I just moved out of has a pit bull. She has a purebred fuckin’ American Staffordshire, and she’s saying ‘oh yeah well you know they have an air bubble in their brain, and when it pops they attack.’ And it’s like, ‘you own this dog and you’re spreading this lie. And it’s a lie, it’s all a lie! On the fuckin’ American Temperament Testing Society they rate, I think it’s 84.7 percent pass rate. This is just a dog like any other. Of course there are some vicious ones but there’s vicious bichon frise. Every animal, including human beings has this tendency that there are vicious ones of us all. And I mean, it’s no different with dogs and I think something has to be done about dog attacks with BSL, it’s just the exact wrong thing. Also, it affects a lot more dogs than we even realize. Because it is a mutt breed – there is no just ‘standard pit bull’ – the definition of a pit bull or a bully-type breed in Ontario is medium sized, short hair, short snout, large brow. That’s a boxer, you know? That’s a ton of different dogs, none of them are necessarily pit bulls. That effects more people than we even realize. It certainly affects some people very close to me, and I think it’s an incredible injustice.

&gt;MN: Is that what inspired you to do all this research and become well-spoken on the subject?

 
&gt;RW: I suppose so, and also I rescue animals, and I would like to start fostering pit bulls hopefully when the ban is lifted to attempt to lift the stigma. My girlfriend and I adopted a dog last year, and she’s just the greatest. We want to remove the stigma not only from adopting animals but from pit bulls themselves. A lot of people think ‘oh, when you adopt a dog you can’t have the kind of dog that you want, and they come with problems and you have to sort them out’ and it’s like ‘sure, that might happen’ but you can pick any dog because there’s hundreds of thousands of dogs who need homes. What really needs to fuckin’ happen is breeding needs to become illegal. These fuckin’ assholes that are like breeding these animals that there is an abundance of in the wild are terrible people. I don’t care if they fuckin’ go out of their way to be nice or be wonderful in a social setting – this is a fuckin’ injustice. I think breeding is some of the worst shit you can do. I’ve been there, I’ve experienced it – I’ve been to a breeder’s house and it’s disgusting. It’s greasy as a skillet and I don’t care nice they are, they’re bad people. *laughs*"

"Question about the Devin Townsend Project","So I just recently got into Devin Townsend's stuff and I'm really loving it. Retinal Circus has completely convinced me that I absolutely need to see this guy live. My question is does he bring all of that stuff with him or was this just a one time show? Like how often does he put on a huge show like that? "
"Question about the Devin Townsend Project","I catch him every time he comes to town. 

No, he doesn't bring the full Circus gear with him, but that doesn't detract from the show whatsoever. It's still one of the most powerful, funny shows you'll see live. 

Sadly, Anneke rarely tours with him in the states. He normally just uses her backing tracks. "
"Question about the Devin Townsend Project","ahh that is a bit disappointing! But I don't think it will stop me from catching him if he comes near me. Thank you for the answer!"
"Question about the Devin Townsend Project","Definitely see him if you get the chance. I've seen him three times and he always puts on a spectacular show."

"And So I Watch You From Afar - A Little Bit of Solidarity Goes a Long Way",""
"And So I Watch You From Afar - A Little Bit of Solidarity Goes a Long Way","The overly long title gives it away that this is more along the lines of noisy postrock, but AWIWYFA has always been a bit of a grey area for me, since they're energetic enough and occasionally heavy enough, if it was mixed a bit differently could sound like metal. The mix on their second album 'Gangs' was even closer, especially the drums, such as on [Search:Party:Animal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFXcfEQ2Gv0), which has a great groove.

Really I just wanted to post this because it's probably in my ""Top 5 songs in 5"" (ha!) list, right up there with [Vicarious by Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOKV9Stri_M)."
"And So I Watch You From Afar - A Little Bit of Solidarity Goes a Long Way","I think post-rock can fit comfortably in a few different genres, depending on their style.  I certainly enjoy this album."

"And So I Watch You From Afar - A Little Bit of Solidarity Goes a Long Way","Was not expecting this kind of sound from r/progmetal, but was pleased nonetheless! Thanks for sharing.

FTFY"
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","Amen to that."
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","Sound Awake is fantastic, but Asymmetry is a work of art (I'm a sucker for concept albums. Alter Bridge's ABIII, Contortionist's Language, Periphery's new album). I love both. Never really clicked with Themata. "
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","Themata takes time, and it's a bit nu-metal, but it's an *incredible* collection of songs "
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","Considering the drums for that album were all written and recorded by Drew, their lead guitarist, that album is amazing."
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","Each of their albums are they're own sound in themselves I find. I've never heard anyone not liking Themata though, every second of that album is pure bliss, it's catchier than ebola. "
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","Asymmetry is concept record?

Edit: I forgot what FTFY is short for.."
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","You know, I never really got into Themata either. I think that's because I listened to Sound Awake first. Sound Awake is concept album, as well, by the way. About a guy trying to escape the church, I believe? Something like that."
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","During my first listen through this album, I though they could have stopped at ""New Day"" and they still would have made the world a much better place. After finishing the album, I don't think I could live without any of the other songs. This one included. So good."
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","I've been listening to this one a lot lately. The melodic switch from ""I needed to know"" to ""oh no, this can't be happening"" halfway through the song might be my favorite moment in any Karnivool song, and the 9/4 groove after that is bliss. I'm so psyched for that North America tour that was rumored."
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","My personal favorite is the gradual buildup from when the song goes mostly quiet up until the ""AWAY!"" line. Such a perfect build up and release of tension; I literally get goosebumps every time I listen to it."
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","It's honestly so hard for me to pick a favorite song. Everything they put out is brilliant. "
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","Illumine gets almost no love (I don't think the band like it, they don't play it live really), but it has such a badass bass-line/groove, I can listen to it all day."
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","It is pretty underappreciated, especially when you consider how well it and ""The Caudal Lure"" fit together."
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","Totally.  The Caudal Lure's intro breaks my brain every time."
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","I'm trying to get into these guys, after reading the comments, I should do a full run through of this album?"
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","Yes! "
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","Absolutely. Sound Awake is one of those albums where the songs themselves are great, but the entire album is an experience and fits together so perfectly. It's easily the most well-constructed album I've ever heard. Call me biased but if Fables from a Mayfly didn't exist, this would be my favorite album."
"Karnivool - Deadman. In my opinion, this song is their crowning achievement","Hearing this live last year from the front row and then chatting with the guys in a small club in Brasov was incredible."

"Haken - In Memoriam","Fuck, My personal favorite album by them. I remember, the first time I heard them, it was with this album. Somebody recommended them on here to somebody else, and I decided to go listen to it, and the path came on, and I was like it's okay, kind of reminds me of a more upbeat tooł song, and then atlas song came on, and I actually heard the instrumentation, I think I cried by the end of the album that first time, it was so beautiful. It IS so beautiful. And it's been a year now, I've (legally) purchased every album by them, and I'm anticipating the release of their next album, because if they keep up to their previous pattern, it should be around August to November of next year. "
"Haken - In Memoriam","this is by far my favorite song on the album.  Everyone i know either loves or hates this band because they ""sound like dream theater"", which honestly is pretty on point.  I can sympathize with those who don't connect with the style, even though I'm a huge fan of both this album and all things DT.  That said, this song seems to be undeniably appealing.

"Haken - In Memoriam","Dream Theater? Fuck no, these guys actually have voices that don't sound obnoxious. The instrumentation and writing in terms of harmonic and rhythmic concepts is way more interesting. And you actually hear homages to other prog progenitors like King Crimson instead of just being entirely self referential. I don't think these guys sound like dream theater at all. "
"Haken - In Memoriam","im sure they have other influences, but they dont sound like DT at all?  cmon... I could literally point out riffs that they ""stole"" or were massively influenced by.

This entire album's structure even seems loosely based around the structure Scenes from a memory.  quiet opening sets the themes before the first real song.  Song starts, does some proggy shit, but then goes into a bluesy riff to break it up and be like ""aight we're ready to go"" .

home/paradoilia are at basically the same place in the album, and are both the ""phrygian dominant"" sounding song on the album.  finally free/somebody both start quiet after the song that might have been the ultimate climax of the album.

i can keep going and be more specific, but you're in straight denial if you think these dudes arent MASSIVELY influenced by DT.

listen to that song off their new EP, i think its called ""the dark eternal night"" or something, if you need more evidence."
"Haken - In Memoriam","Vocals in this one are so powerful. I love how this, by comparison, is among their shorter songs, but it still has so much intensity packed into it."
"Haken - In Memoriam","This is such an amazing band, and I fucking loved that album. It satisfied a musical craving I didn't even know I had."
"Haken - In Memoriam","Does anyone else know of bands similar to Haken and Dream Theater I really like both of these bands and want to find more music like them. I just have a hard time sifting through music trying to find stuff I like."
"Haken - In Memoriam","You would enjoy Circus Maximus and their album Nine."
"Haken - In Memoriam","Love CM, but I would suggest starting with their first album The First Chapter, as it is more in keeping with the music of Haken/DT. Then listen to the rest in order, as they are all fantastic."
"Haken - In Memoriam","Agreed, First Chapter and Isolate are both more solid starting points imo."
"Haken - In Memoriam","Just started listening to the album... Holy crap this sounds awesome!"
"Haken - In Memoriam","They aren't too much like Dream Theater, but I also recommend [Seventh Wonder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDKiemSbFhs) to anyone that likes Circus Maximus."

"Mike Le Rossetti - Djent Jazz Funk - Absolutely incredible guitar playing. [xpost /r/djent]","I like the idea, and yeah, some great playing, but I wish it all blended together a little more smoothly. Each style is mixed really well, but entirely differently, so when the djenty parts enter it's so much louder and dominant, wish the funk was similarly prominent.

Also don't know if making one chord diminished in your 4-chord progression and adding some clean lines really counts as 'jazz', but that's opening a whole different can of worms. Overall I enjoyed both the music and the idea of it, think it could certainly develop into something awesome."
"Mike Le Rossetti - Djent Jazz Funk - Absolutely incredible guitar playing. [xpost /r/djent]","Idk I think it was pretty well blended, I think the fact that it was a bit of a harsh ""transition"" between the styles is what makes it so cool, it is djent after all."
"Mike Le Rossetti - Djent Jazz Funk - Absolutely incredible guitar playing. [xpost /r/djent]","For sure, abrupt transitions are fine, it's just more of the three levels of volume that make it seem like they don't go together. Cleans=quiet, funk=medium, djent=LOUD."

Almost every comment on Sumerian's page and YouTube are just guitar heads complaining about it being quantized or sped up- Yeah, no shit, it's done for effect.

Off of One, Concealing Fate is drop Ab, so that rules out most of the album unfortunately. Not sure about the rest?"
"Tesseract - Of Matter","The vast majority of their material seems to be in some variant of drop A: AEAEAD or something like that. I just tuned to a more typical drop A; they don't often push into the very very high end of the range anyway. As long as you have that low A you can pretty much take your pick."

Hey man it's pretty early to call that. Someone might insult Periphery or BTBAM RIP dat poor soul. "
"Tesseract - Of Matter","What's so hard to understand? He's saying djent is boring. He's right. "
"Tesseract - Of Matter","Metabog?? Abodean Skye Metabog??

If so, nice to see you here and I fucking love Abodean Skye and Purity."
"Tesseract - Of Matter","Heh.  It is indeed me!"
"Tesseract - Of Matter","Djent is boring but this album pure magic. "
"Tesseract - Of Matter","But that's not how it is at all. And I don't think their intent on this record was to throw as many notes in the tracks and movements as possible, I think the intent was to create an experience out of an atmosphere. They use the reverb, the delay,  even the vocals not necessarily as solitary instruments but rather as ingredients in a metaphorical soup. 

But, I understand some people won't like it and that's okay! I hope I didn't come off snide or cynical, nor do I mean to change your mind, only to explain (my interpretation of the album)."
"Tesseract - Of Matter","Well, you're on /r/progmetal so you can pretty much expect almost all the songs to be the djentiest djent that ever djented a djent."

"3 - The End Is Begun",""
"3 - The End Is Begun","I saw this band when they opened for Dream Theater, Opeth, and Between the Buried and Me on the Progressive Nation tour back in 2008. I was only 16 at the time and had just started experimenting with prog. Their live performance absolutely blew me away and completely sold me on the genre. From that evening on, prog metal has become an absolutely vital part of my life so I really feel like I owe a lot to them. Much love and highly underrated. "
"3 - The End Is Begun","That tour was the first time I ever heard them as well. I was really blown away by their set, and they just looked like they were having so much fun."
"3 - The End Is Begun","I saw them during the same tour. They are one of the few bands whose live performance is significantly better than their studio recordings."
"3 - The End Is Begun","I recommend listening to the whole album, it flows so well. It's a whole experience."
"3 - The End Is Begun","This is probably one of my favorite albums ever. I really like their older album Wake Pig too. So much talent here!

Dude, if you like this band check out Joey Eppard's(the lead guitarist and vocalist) solo album.  It's really good as well.  

Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93-XcS7zjz0

and on his solo album: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_IKgh7F_m0"
"3 - The End Is Begun","I saw this band in concert with coheed in 2006. I hadn't heard them before but I was instantly sold. I bought Wake Pig, and slowly fell in love with their whole discography. When this album came out I couldn't stop listening to it. One of my highest rated albums. I think if they were picked up by a different label they could be more widely appreciated."
"3 - The End Is Begun","I haven't heard 3 in forever. They had a song on a metal blade records sampler disc I got at the first Mayhem Fest. "
"3 - The End Is Begun","I watched these guys play a show at The Tabernacle I believe, may have been the Alabama Music Box before it closed down. They played with Coheed and The Dear Hunter and it was fantastic. Wonderful band live, I highly recommend seeing their show if the opportunity every arrives."
"3 - The End Is Begun","These guys are crazy good live. I first discovered them opening for Porcupine Tree back in 2007, and they blew the roof off. Really impressive, and they were touring behind this album at the time and opened with the first 3 songs. I was initially disappointed slightly that the album didn't do the live performance justice, although I loved it as well.

They really seemed to have some momentum after this with the Prog Nation tour that I think they really wasted by dropping an album of oddities and re-recordings rather than a new album proper (which eventually came and was really good), and by really keeping most of their touring local to the Woodstock-Hudson area.  I still got to see them at two smaller venues in Philly in 08-09 or so.

I do recommend checking out their whole catalogue. TEIB is my favorite (all killer, no filler), but their earliest stuff has a much different vibe - less progressive metal, more funky influence."
"3 - The End Is Begun","I have recently gotten into 3 and I am stoked to see it get posted here. I saw this was Josh Eppards brothers band so I checked it out out of curiosity, and now I am hooked. Cool to see them pop up on my front page. "
"3 - The End Is Begun","They really don't have a bad album (well Summercamp Nightmare wasn't great, but certainly not bad either). Even their debut, though not tacitly prog and certainly not metal at all, is a great, unique record."
"3 - The End Is Begun","Never heard anything quite like this before and im loving it!"
"3 - The End Is Begun","I saw them open for Porcupine Tree once and immediately got this album.  I've never gotten around to checking out their other stuff but this is a good nudge to do so."

"Horse The Band - Arrive","I love HORSE The Band but are they really progmetal?"
"Horse The Band - Arrive","I'd say Desperate Living could definitely fall into the prog category somewhat. Especially the song Rape Escape."
"Horse The Band - Arrive","Weird, that's the one I originally thought about posting. I figured Arrive had more metal to it though."
"Horse The Band - Arrive","Wasn't really sure where else they fit. Post-Hardcore refused them. They're definitely proggy, and have some metal elements to them."
"Horse The Band - Arrive","Really? I've posted them there and seen them posted with a welcome response. And they weave in and out of post-hc and metalcore I'd say. Some definite prog elements here and there tho. Especially on Desperate Living and A Natural Death. Idk if I'd consider the other records to have much prog influence in them. "
"Horse The Band - Arrive","Weird, I'd see them more of a post-hardcore band than progmetal but I'm glad to see them getting some recognition!"
"Horse The Band - Arrive","posthardcore and metalcore have strict rules on what bands to post. /r/progmetal is more open."

"I am thinking of purchasing a 7 string guitar, anyone have advice on what to get/stay away from?","So I currently have a Schecter C-7 Blackjack.  It has been my pride and joy for about 5 years now, but I might want to get another one.  
I have looked into getting an Agile Septor 727 RN CP TOM, I have an 8-string Agile and they seem like a decent manufacturer.  I have also looked at a Sterling Music Man JP70 7-String because I know that they make high-quality guitars. I was just wondering if anyone here had some advice on which one to get?  Or if anyone thinks there are better options out there?  Also, I write/play primarily prog metal/death metal/metalcore stuff. Thanks a bunch."

"I am thinking of purchasing a 7 string guitar, anyone have advice on what to get/stay away from?","I figured that much, I just thought that because I would be using the guitar for prog metal music this might be a good place to ask as well."

"I am thinking of purchasing a 7 string guitar, anyone have advice on what to get/stay away from?","Awesome! Yea the Sterling is a tad out of my price range but I'd rather get something I know will be good than to get a cheap guitar that turns out to be shit.  Thanks for the response!"

"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal",""
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","A lot of Prog Metal these days seems to be a contest of ""Who can incorporate the most jazz into their sound"". Eventually these Prog Metal bands will just be Jazz bands haha. Not that I'm complaining, love me some jazz."
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","In my opinion, a lot of the prog metal is just the modern jazz fusion with basis more in rock music, or the mature metal of today. "
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","That would be true if Jazz Fusion was much less common these days, but Prog Metal should still be able to cite metal as an influence. Bands like CHON are great, but it's more Jazz than metal."
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","I do know what you mean, but for anyone outside of metal, it still sounds like metal. It's hard to explain, but it's like someone just stating something is jazz. Well is it bop, big band, dixie, hardbop etc. they're all vastly different, but the outsider will call it all jazz. "
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","I think a lot of people that enjoy progressive metal can take a look at the artistry and complexity involved in bands like CHON that are more jazz than metal and draw very close parallels.  Doesn't help that bands like (dont shoot me, just off the top of my head) AAL do a pretty good job of getting the really heavy and the pretty jazzy in their albums."
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","I'm kinda getting tired of. AAL was my first taste of it, some I guess some of BTBAM's stuff. Then I got into Ever Forthright and liked it at first. Same with Octopus. I was cool for a while, then I just started to skip the super jazzy songs."
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","Ever Forthright kid of overdid it, I think.

However, whatever this kid is doing is unlike other stuff I've heard, and if I'm not listening to prog/progmetal, I'm listening to jazz. He does some weird shit."
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","Jazz isn't for everyone, and I'm not sure it should be what Prog is about, considering Jazz isn't inherently progressive. Still, sometimes a big fucking splash of Jazz in a metal song can be fantastic."
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","Agreed. I just think I've been oversaturated too much for my taste. I still love it. Mestis is probably my favorite instrumental act out now, but that's more latin fusion than jazz at most parts. Also, it's not really metal."
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","I love stuff like this, like Plini, Plini is fucking awesome. And as a guitarist this stuff is just so much fun to play. I mean, I love melodeath but playing it's not nearly as fun as playing a Chon song."

"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","I definitely wouldn't call this unreal. Sounds cool but the production is very underwhelming and the thumping should have been left out- Reminds me of local metalcore bands who just learned to sweep for the first time. The chord choices are all fantastic, though."
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","wow and he plays drums I hate this guy. "
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","The only difference between him and you is the amount of work he's willing to put in ;)"
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","I would disagree with that. While there is some truth to what you're saying (that without discipline, none of that would be possible), I think some people just ""get it."" You can practice technical skills all day, and know theory inside and out, but in my opinion its that little bit of magic inside certain individuals that makes the theory/technical skills truly come alive. I dunno, just my two cents."
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","It seems to me that all of the really amazing guitarists have one thing in common. They practice all day, every day. They live, eat, and breathe their instrument.

I've yet to see someone with that amount of passion for what they do that doesn't also have the creative spark to go with it. The hard work is what makes it possible to find the spark inside of you, everyone has it, but not everyone is willing to push through the uncomfortable bullshit that comes before finding it."
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","Or, it could be that the reason you still have yet to see someone with that amount of passion yet doesn't have the creative spark is because those people are all just still practicing in their basement and no one is recommending their youtube videos."
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","The creative spark will come after time.
After years of consistent playing, the dots start to connect themselves. As well as listening to a wide range of music exposing yourself to new ideas."
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","Yeah I have no doubt he works hard but he definitely has a knack for music more than other people. Otherwise he'd be nothing special. Really looking forward to hearing more of his music."

"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","Eh.

Surely I'm not the only one who finds this stuff to be absolutely unbearable? And it's not because I don't like jazz, I love jazz, when it's a sax or a trumpet over piano and drums, but just playing jazzy chords at random times with no feel for melody just seems like showing off. Maybe it's just the guitar tone though

It's better than djent though, thank god that fad's gone."
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","pretty sure he's not playing them at 'random' times.  "
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","I kind of agree. He sounds like a derivation of Animals as Leaders, which are highly hit or miss for me. I don't like the overly quantised djent sound that this kid and AAL have. 


I don't find it unbearable though, it just doesn't excite me in the slightest. "
"Holy shit it happened... More from ""Owane""! This kid is unreal","Djent gone? I mean now that the sound has had a change to merge a bit with progressive metal as a whole (or other various forms of metal), there's certainly less music that solely identifies with 'djent' as it's main genre or characterization, but it's certainly not *gone*."

"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second"," I've been listening to a good deal of Dream Theater tonight for no apparent reason. I'm not a dedicated fan to their work but I do of course appreciate it all and thoroughly enjoy listening to it.  
  
 We all know Labrie gets a bad rap sometimes but I want to talk about how amazing he sounds in songs such as Octavarium and Forsaken. There are plenty more but they stick out in my mind. I have to say he's one of a few singers that evoke a totally different feeling in me. There's something grandiose and epic about his voice that really draws me in.  
  
 I just wanted to show some love for this extraordinarily talented man that I'm not even a huge fan of. "
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Whenever someone bad mouths LaBrie, I always wish they'd listen to Ayreon's ""Human Equation"" album. No matter what you think of his work with Dream Theater, I think we can all agree he was amazing on that album."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Strangely, I almost always like him better in non-DT stuff. I just can't stand it when he tries to sound like Hetfield. The heavier phase DT through in the 00s didn't play to his strengths."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","As a singer, working with different producers makes you sound differently. When Petrucci is producing he always seems to be searching for the ""perfect"" take (correct pitch, speed, volume etc.) rather than the most emotional take, which can make LaBrie's voice sound dull and less powerful than it should be."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Awesome performance on an even more awesome album."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","uhh, i thought he was absolutely terrible on that album.  Which is weird because he was pretty decent on Ocatavarium and they botth came out the same year."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","[deleted]"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","I may be majorly biased as a huge fan of the group, but I definitely agree with you. 

Yes, his voice is not everyone's cup of tea, and yes, it certainly isn't as powerful as it once was either. But over the years he's come to regain much of that power and can certainly hold his own in a live setting now. 

Just compare a number of live recordings from the Falling into Infinity/Scenes from a Memory era to how he's sounded on the last two or three tours. He's undeniably improved as a vocalist. He knows his limits/strengths now and sticks to them for the most part.

To me, he complements the music of Dream Theater perfectly. His voice is distinctive and gels with their music better than any other singer I could see performing with them potentially. Grandiose, soaring moments balanced with sensitive and emotive ones. 

Great singer overall, and one deserving major props for what he does and the work he's done to get where he is presently.
"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Wait, you're suggesting he got *better*?

He was undeniably at his peak in 93-94, before the vocal chord poisoning. "
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","No, not saying he's at his best now, just that his voice as it currently stands is better than it was post-food poisoning. I agree that he was at his best in the 92-94 period, I'm just saying that as of now, he's recovered quite a bit of what he's lost.

He's certainly not where he was during the Images/Awake era, but he's been steadily getting better since recovering from that food poisoning, and is sounding quite good now. "
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Live, maybe.

In studio i still prefer SFAM era"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Yeah, in studio he's moved away from his old operatic style to more of a snarly generic tone. He still has his moments, but his studio peak was definitely the 90s"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","personally, i feel james is better than their 2nd vocalist, [charlie dominici](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l326glc1XQ)"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Their first vocalist wasn't much better. Especially considering he may or may not have gotten John Myung so angry the other band members had to restrain him."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","John Myung has emotions?"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Apparently he doesn't take kindly to being introduced as ""And on bass, from the jungles of Korea..."""
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Absolutely. Charlie isn't a bad singer, but he was the wrong guy for DT. That said, there's still a charm to that first album, warts and all."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","[like this, for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5OmzUEm504)"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","My favorite by far is [The Killing Hand.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oez4tDWeEHA)"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","I agree. The Killing Hand is actually spectacular. I can't say much more for basically the rest of the album, though. "
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","I've always felt LaBrie is an extremes kind of guy: he's either really good or really bad and almost never in the middle. He's very inconsistent basically, but when he's on he's fantastic. He's gotten markedly better live over the years (see the Live In Tokyo to see how terrible he used to be) but he's always been pretty good in the studio. He's just one of those really polarizing singers that people tend to either love or hate. I've actually started to like him less over the years based on comparisons to others... I listen to Michael Erikson for example and LaBrie sounds much worse all of a sudden to my ears. 

But hey, if James LaBrie is the WORST part of your band then you're doing pretty damned good! :) "

"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","I tend not to be a fan of happier songs, but Take the Time is just amazingly infectious and has so much enthusiasm. James LaBrie's vocals are perfect for it."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","I would probably hate LaBrie if it weren't for those early albums, I can only ever dream of reaching the notes he hits in Take the Time. It's definitely on my list of top 5 DT songs ever. "
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","LaBrie makes the song shine, but really, everything about it is killer. The guitar/keyboard part at at 4:49 is so awesome, and actually the entire instrumental section just doesn't get mentioned enough when it comes to DT instrumental segments. I like to whistle along to vocal lines, but when I reach the high notes of Take the Time I'm stuffed - not a chance. "
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Haha yeah, Take the Time is probably the song that made me fall in love with Dream Theater as a band."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","For me it was Stream of Consciousness."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Let's not forget his solo work. Static Impulse and Impermanent Resonance are two of my favorite albums, and I like them better than even the last two Dream Theater albums."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","I think his solo stuff suits him much better than the DT stuff as well. I dislike his vocal style when used in the context of DT, but in his solo stuff he's actually really good. "
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","I always thought he peaked on Live at the Marquee...so early on. He sounded unbelievable on that album. I still love some newer stuff though, I find the heavier songs suit him more.

But that's not to say Scenes from a Mem isn't a perfectly sung, classic prog-metal album...Labrie is also amazing there. I love Count of Tuscany too, phenomenal and me and the wife always sing along to it. 

But yeah sometimes I feel it's take it or leave it with him. There's no doubt though that when he shines, it's literally blinding and there doesn't seem anyone better suited to Dream Theater. He's a true anomaly in some cases. The songs you mentioned in your post and loads of others, old and new, he can just sound amazing. 

I just can't pin down what's missing sometimes. Then other times I realise. I still go to see DT though."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","&gt; I always thought he peaked on Live at the Marquee

His performance in The Killing Hand is the performance that I fantasise about doing. His range is incredible in that song"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","&gt; I find the heavier songs suit him more

Really? I think the heavier stuff can get pretty cringeworthy."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","All a matter of personal taste, I guess...I liked the heavier style of Dream Theater - everything from Train of Thought to Black Clouds....that ""era"" of the band did produce some cracking heavy tunes....but overall yeah its definitely a mixed bag for me. I prefer the heavier music style generally, even though Scenes is my favourite of all of them which falls out of that range I guess. As I say it's a mixed bag from start to finish but I do love some of those heavy moments..."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Yeah a lot of their heavier stuff is pretty awesome but I personally don't think LaBrie's voice is suitable for that kind of music. Just my personal opinion, of course."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","I love me some Labrie. Didn't care for him at first, took a couple years in fact, but now I really respect him as a vocalist. I recognize that he had a hard time for awhile, but I think he's recovered pretty well. I've seen them live 4 times since systematic, and he gets better each time.

Check out his solo albums if you haven't, he sounds great in them.

"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Most people don't understand how manly the dude is. The reason his voice is the way it is, is because he was in Chile and he got food poisoning. He vomited so hard and so much, that he RUPTURED HIS VOCAL CHORDS. And he recovered and chose to keep on singing. Pretty badass imo.

&gt;On December 29, 1994, while vacationing in Cuba, LaBrie was stricken with a severe case of [food poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_poisoning) from contaminated shrimp and while vomiting, he ruptured his vocal cords. He saw three throat specialists who all said there was nothing they could do except have him rest his voice as much as possible. However, on January 12, 1995, and against doctor's orders, he was on the [Waking Up the World Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Up_the_World_Tour) in Japan promoting *[Awake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awake_(Dream_Theater_album\))* album with his voice far from normal.  LaBrie has said he did not feel vocally ""normal"" until at least 2002. LaBrie has said that this was a very hard time for him as a singer, and depression as a result caused him to consider departing from the band, although his bandmates supported him and told him to stay. After the *Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence'*s [World Tourbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tourbulence) he discovered that his voice had fully returned. He has said that his voice was fully healed by time and training.

"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","you are a lovely bot"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","I'm not sure DT would have made it big time if it weren't for Labrie. His singing on Images and Words is outstanding!

That being said, he has plenty of cringe moments"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","What could have been.  He had food poisoning in 1994 from some bad shellfish and ruptured his vocal cords from all of the vomiting.  This was right after Awake.  He's still an exceptional singer, but you can tell the difference between Awake and Infinity/Metropolis 2.  The parts they wrote for him were nowhere near as high and exciting.  He said right around BCaSL he recovered, and that was his strongest album since awake.

Also nowadays I feel like he doesn't have the chops to sing some of his high notes from earlier songs.  He really strains on some and seems tentative on them as well.  I'm not crazy on his parts for the post-Portnoy albums, he doesn't really have many standout performances.

I loooove him on Human Equation. The lower area of his voice has a lot of depth and Arjen wrote to that.  He also had some very impressive screams like the one at the very end.

All in all, he is one of my favorite metal singers, but I think he missed most of his prime singing years afflicted by the ruptured vocal cords.  "
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","I duno man. I'd say his chops are fine. He pretty much nailed Innoscence Faded on the SCORE! DVD, and he really belts it out during the ""mothers for their children"" section of Illumination Theory."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","I'm not saying he can't belt it. But you can tell he has much more trouble than he did on awake. He owned awake and sailed for those high notes. His approach had to be very different after he got sick.  I've heard him say in interviews that he didn't feel really strong in his voice for 10-12 years and those were the best singing years of his life. "
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","He still hits the notes, but you can tell that he's putting all his effort into just hitting them. Back in the day he'd smash the note and then do whatever the hell else he wanted to do with it. He had so much control and he could pretty much do what he wanted with his voice, thats the biggest thing thats missing now. The absolute range is still there"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Since every time people talk about him, no one mentions the live album where he sings the songs from the first one, the one with Dominici, I think it must be consensus that he was HORRIBLE in that one. Seriously, he throws some highs in the songs that are absolutely terrible."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","i love him, but it took a while to get used to. i can see why a lot of people are put off, but i think he suits the band well."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","He sounds best when he is most raw. The more overproduced I've heard him, the less satisfying. DT's newest album for example, is one of the most lacking vocally, spare Illumination Theory. That is because he sounds robotic for most of the album but really gets raw and dirty in Illumination Theory. Secondly, for a long chunk of his career he was dealing with getting over food poisoning, which really messed up his range for a while (which lead to him requiring a bunch of studio effects in the meantime). Overall, incredible singer but has lately been held back by Petrucci's writing style and production.
"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","I used to really love JLB on the older DT stuff, his voice suited their music perfectly... But all their new stuff (SC and forward, but ADTOE and beyond especially) I dunno, he really annoys me :/"
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","Forsaken has always stood out to me as what sounds like Labrie straining against his vocal range. I'll listen to it again, but I vividly remember when he says ""forsaken,"" it really bothering me."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","He's got a great voice, and it's easily recognizable too. But even though he's near-perfect on studio albums, he's pretty annoying on live recordings, imo."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","He used to really over do it with his vibrato in the past, but he's really got it under control in recent years. I wonder if he started working with a new vocal coach."
"Can we talk about James Labrie for a second","I love DT and have a been a huge fan for many years, but I really can't stand Labrie i think he's awful and DT would be so much better with a different vocalist."

Which really shows how progressive and original they are with their music, but often times leaves old school fans in the dust. I still remember when TiA was released and it received a lot of flack from old school fans since it deviated so much from the debut album, bu the Portal Tapes were evidence that the original sound was already being moved away from."

The problem is that the list is only 10 bands long and I can't think of a reason to bump Cynic and Animals as Leaders off there considering how influential both of them are."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","You can sure as hell bump Periphery.

Nothing against Protest the Hero, though. I just got a copy of Scurrilous in December and already listened to it about nine million times.

EDIT: Oh, shit. I accidentally dissed Periphery. "
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Huge fan of heaps of those bands but for me it's gotta be Symphony X! A lot of the others are more of a new generation in my eyes, which I think should have its own hall of fame in about a decade haha."

Just think about the bands they'd have to replace in order to make the list. Every current band that's been voted in is a giant of the genre and holds a deserving spot. "
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Hey, I'm not complaining. It was meant in good humour. It's nice that we have such a diverse genre with such incredible depth that there are so many candidates that are so deserving of a place. "
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Gotcha."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Sorry, I just want to clarify.

The Hall of Fame is limited to so many spots so if a new band is to be inaugurated into it they have to *replace* another well-deserving band? Or is the Hall of Fame a list that we can simply *add* new, well-deserving bands to?

I think I know the answer is the latter but your wording suggests the former."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","You are correct on that it's the latter. Our current plan is to stop at 10 bands (for now). 

What I meant by saying ""think about the bands they'd have to replace,"" I was trying to get at the fact that if someone is surprised that a band has not been voted in *yet,* then that would imply that necessarily one of the current bands would have to have lost the spot in order for the unvoted band to be in the list at this very time. "
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Ah, I see. I was just curious if there was some arbitrary decision to stop at the current number and I just missed it somehow. Eight would be an unusual number to pause at although ten would be leaving out huge names in the scene still, it seems a good point to pause for a while.

Thanks for explaining."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Haken all the way"
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","I *almost* voted for Haken. I didn't because in my opinion they're too young of a band to be in a *hall of fame*. They've only been making music for 4 years (3 LPs and 1 EP)."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","i'm curious, that's only one LP less than Tool have released. Considering the strength of all three of Hakens LPs and the EP as well, what is the reason that Tool have made ""enough"" music, but Haken haven't?"
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","I'm not OP but my guess would be the Tool has been making music for 25 years, even though they've only had 4 albums + Opiate. Haken, from my minuscule research, has been making music for 8 years. I personally don't mind either way but that could be his/her logic."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","I guess that's true, although they haven't made any for the past 8 years too."

I am not a fan of too much ""djent"" except for Tesseract and maybe Animals as Leaders. 
Why is that once a band picks up a Guitar of 7 strings or more does it have be ""djent"" ?"
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","I'm actually not a fan of djent either, but the reality is that it's fused into what's considered prog metal, for better or for worse, and that's not about to change. That doesn't mean we're (the mods) going to turn a blind eye to it and pretend it isn't legitimate, though. I think most of us don't really care for djent, but again, that doesn't matter one way or another in regards to how we run the place. "
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Not complaining about this sub ;) . Just a general observation of prog metal and increasing popularity of djent over ""traditional"" progmetal like DT, Symphony X, Ayreon over the past 4 years or so. 

If ya got 7+ strings ...use them all equally ;)"
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","In regards to your last comment I think you'd be surprised by a lot of the material a band like Periphery (kind of the flagship for the whole ""djent"" thing) has. Some of it is chuggy and overly rhythmic, but there's a lot of melodic playing and intricate harmony in many of their parts. I don't mean this in a negative way toward you and totally respect you may not like their sound but the whole open string chug chug chug is only a small piece of their sound. PII is probably the best album to listen to for guitar work that goes beyond what most people think of as djent, and PI has a lot of cool stuff too."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Yeah Periphery claim to bring djent out into the open, but they hardly play open note-fret #1 on the lowest string constantly. Bands like Periphery and Animals As Leaders use it as part of the composition but I think what bothers many people is the over use and composing around the ""djent"" sound rather than use it as a part or addition to the music itself.  
  
While they have their fans, bands like Volumes, really oversimplify their sound and can deter some people to categorize as ""djent is bad."""
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Animals as Leaders! Rockin' it out since the debut"
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","I voted for Haken, Sikth, Intronaut and AAL."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","It's more than likely bound to be Periphery. Just from their popularity alone over the past years and the release of Juggernaut still ringing in listeners' ears today would propel them to get the most votes."

"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","The thing with periphery is that they're so new compared to any other band in the hall of fame.

It was pretty god damn bad.

Nocturne was an absolute fucking masterpiece however."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","I liked Digital Veil better. IMO the non-harsh (not exactly clean either; I guess I'd call them aggressive cleans) vocals on Nocturne were a bit hard to listen to. But the shredding on that album was unreal."

I totally voted The Human Abstract though, still a bit early for some bands like The Contortionist and Animals As Leaders"
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","My thoughts exactly with The Contortionist and AAL. They'll have plenty of time, and with three albums each, there's definitely a ways to go for them.

Although I did vote for Periphery, despite the fact that their first album came out in 2010. But they're still a 10-year-old band, so I think they're a fair choice for Hall of Fame."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Yeah, Midheaven sucked. I love Nocturne and Digital Veil though. The thing for me is though, is a band with only two noteworthy albums who are no longer even active really deserving of a hall of fame spot? Let me reiterate, I fucking LOVE THA. But I just don't think they quite reached that level. Which is a damn shame, because they absolutely could have."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","They also had an EP, so I guess they're sort of qualified. But I definitely think they had influence on bands like Art By Numbers and others who followed the neoclassical style."

"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","&gt;Fates Warning and Queensryche aren't that good

Subjective and overall worthless as a critique. 

&gt;Cynic is overhyped

Subjective again and unanalytical, again. 

&gt;and had a huge dead period

Why does that have anything to do with how influential or definitive a band is?

&gt;I've never even heard of PW and Watchtower.

I'm afraid this is no one's fault but yours. It would be more worthwhile to do some research rather than blindly discount insanely important bands. 

&gt;Ayreon has a six-album (including multiple double albums) concept spanning thirteen years, plus a wealth of other material both with Ayreon and related projects.

It seems you're basing your standards off of the pure volume of content a band has released? That doesn't make much sense. 

Ayreon is a great project, and like Bujjick, I'd have no problem seeming them in the HoF. But I'm sorry, they just aren't as important or influential as you're making them out to be. That's not even comparing them to all of the bands I listed off. "
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Did you miss the part about it being a six-album *concept suite*? 

It's not just about quantity, obviously. But quantity matters. Quality matters. FAME matters. Progressiveness matters. If Dream Theater wouldn't exist without Fates Warning, does that mean Iron Maiden should be in the HoF? 

To me, the prog metal hall of fame should be about who represents the genre of progressive metal the best and the brightest. Ayreon is that. "
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","&gt;Did you miss the part about it being a six-album concept *suite*?

I could theoretically write and release a six-album concept *suite* of my own. But the virtue of the fact alone that I've done this doesn't really mean anything. 

Fame doesn't necessarily matter at all, in my opinion. Well, it matters in the sense that naturally the most famous bands *will* make this list--that's just how voting works. Please familiarize yourself with the Hall of Fame's purpose: ""[bands that are] hugely influential and/or essential to the genre of progressive metal."" No where is fame in and of itself a constituent in order to meet this. A band can be as obscure as the dying sun and they can still easily have a place in our list (whether or not they have a chance of getting in is another question altogether). These same things apply to bands with a small backlog of material. In some cases, all it takes is one album. 

&gt;Progressiveness matters.

That it does. Which is why it's bizarre that you don't favour any of the bands I listed off earlier. Those are the very bands that literally invented the genre and represent the meaning of progressiveness in its truest original sense--and frankly, it's hard to engage in a discussion like this when you haven't even heard of some of them. 

&gt;If Dream Theater wouldn't exist without Fates Warning, does that mean Iron Maiden should be in the HoF?

Why would it? Fates Warning and Dream Theater are both progressive metal bands. This is a list for progressive metal. Iron Maiden is not progressive metal. I don't understand the purpose of this question. 

&gt;To me, the prog metal hall of fame should be about who represents the genre of progressive metal the best and the brightest. Ayreon is that.

Another utterly subjective statement that could easily be replaced with X band for any given person. 

 "
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","You're missing just how influential all those bands you're dismissing are/were.  Not to discredit Ayreon cause I'd be perfectly happy to have him in the hall of fame, but each of those other bands is far more historically important."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","The fact that you don't know Psychotic Waltz while knowing Ayreon so weird.  Ya know Agony from The Human Equation?  That's Devon Graves (Buddy Lackey) and his main band used to be Psychotic Waltz.  Also, Ayreon's albums aren't all the same concept, so that makes I sense to say six album concept.

Also, Watchtower is a very influential band in the prog metal genre.  Influence is one of the most important factors in a hall of fame contest.  It's your fault you don't know them.  What if someone doesn't know Tool and says that's why they shouldn't be in the hall of fame?  It's a shitty reason to say they aren't deserving when your ignorance is the cause."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Well what do you know. Thanks for pointing that out.

""The Final Experiment"", ""Into the Electric Castle"", ""Universal Migrator"" parts 1 and 2, ""The Human Equation"", and ""01011001"" are actually all part of the same storyline. So, yeah, six album concept suite."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Well, that's interesting.  They all are pretty much different, but I guess Arjen maybe said they're the same universe.  I guess it's a six album suite, but it would be hard to say it's the same concept.  So were both right, it just depends on personal definitions."
"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","They're quite definitively linked together in plot and general theme (whether you consider that ""concept"" might I guess differ. They're definitively part of the same story): the message that's sent back in *The Final Experiment* is the same war that *Universal Migrator* is telling the story of the last people surviving; *Y* tells the story of why the war happened (Aliens!), *Electric Castle* (released 10 years prior) introduces said aliens. Human equation is the only one that's more tenuously linked, it could be more considered a side-story in the same world (it's driven by the same reason that was explained in the track ""Forever of the Stars"" in *Electric Castle* - spoilers and all).

Where they all were only tenuously linked together until it's release, *Y* (01011001 is binary for Y) linked them all together conclusively, and has many explicit and direct links to basically every other album."

"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","I'm not necessarily against their inclusion, I'm just attempting to justify why they're likely not in the list.

"Click to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame","Rush are in a somewhat awkward spot when it comes to the history of progressive music.

double string quartet + bass, 1 or 2 percussion (might have to take out a lot of the cymbals or sub in something else for balance, but snare and tympani/bass drum), 1 trumpet, 1 trombone or french horn, piano, harp. Almost a modified Pierrot ensemble, especially if you added a singer."

"Animals as Leaders- Tooth and Claw","I still think their self titled was their best, since it was a bit more of a raw demonstration of pure guitar work how-the-fuckery.  I do like this album 2nd best as it's a bit better blend of their first and 2nd albums, since after my many....many re-listens to Weightless, I've started to think they did a bit too much of the synthesized and offbeat clean stuff and that fell away from the groove of the album as a whole.  Joy of Motion really has a fantastic groove throughout, and doesn't have any low spots."

http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=49897

&gt;Daniel: All of your albums thus far, are connected by an elemental theme. Are you also planning on including the Chinese elements of metal and wood in the future in addition to air? (“Remission” is fire; “Leviathon” is water; “Blood Mountain” is Earth; “Crack the Skye” is the fifth element/aether/quintessence).

&gt;Bill: Yes. We have been thinking about that, the Chinese elements. Because there are a lot of elements out there, not just four or five like some people think.

&gt;Daniel: So do you think that after touring, the next plausible concept would be air element in order to complete the elemental suite?

&gt;Bill: Well, I don’t know. This album is more of an aether based record. But air, I don’t know. It would be something like wind or air I believe, but I don’t really know because we have not crossed that bridge yet.

"Ghost - Ghuleh / Zombie Queen","""A place to discuss music and anything else related to progressive metal.""

Progressive rock relates to progressive metal, bro.

I've posted artists like Anathema and Steven Wilson and there's barely anyone who has an issue with it."
"Ghost - Ghuleh / Zombie Queen","First bud, slow your roll.  People even in this elitist of a community, they like the song. 29 uprons is rather high for this subreddit.  A few things will mark the signs of prog music.

Tonally: Odd, novel, expermental, or unique sounds for a given instrument. 

Virtuosity: In prog rock and especially progmetal Olympian skill level and racing for new limits is key.  It's not necessary, but a machine like execution is required.   There's Braindrill at one end of the spectrum and Cloudkicker at the other.

Melody and Rhythm:  In this you should hear a wider palate of note selection and arrangement.   Longer and more complex phrasing.  

Song structuring:  From the likes of Opeth and Ne Obliviscaris there isn't a formulaic pop structure.  Each song has it's own life and mood linked to the song structure.  There's also the stylings of BTBM who do a zillon riffs off usually one progresson.  Basically each song will not follow some kind of rigid verse chorus verse chorus format.        


While Ghost is a awesome band they're not progressive at all.  They sound like Blue Oyster Cult which is a painfully dated sound.  It's a nice novelty that they have merged that sound with Satanism, but that has nothing to do with musical merit.   They have very simple song structures, melodic voicing and rhythmic style.   The songs are not uniquely arranged.  They employ a very sparse note selection.     Rhythmic phrasing is minimal and has a pop sensibility riding hard on 1234, even on their few song with different time signatures they still ride the down beat on quarter notes. Which bands like Meshuggah and Periphery do as well. They just treat it much differently.    Is ghost tool in this area? No. Even a goofy band like protest the hero is light years ahead of ghost in the rhythm department. 

With all of that said IMO that's what makes Ghost enjoyable.   If you're eating nothing but stake and lobster some times a greasy hamburger is nice.  "
"Ghost - Ghuleh / Zombie Queen","I disagree that complexity and musical virtuosity is essential for music to be progressive. It's certainly common, but I think unusual song structures and musical creativity is much more of a prog staple. Granted, my definition of prog is much wider than for a lot of people (for example I think most Queen albums are pretty progressive)."
"Ghost - Ghuleh / Zombie Queen","I'm in the same boat as /u/helgihermadur here. I believe the creativity behind this particular song makes it progressive. It starts out dark and wonderfully creepy and crescendos into this bizarre surf rock tune. And it's a bit lengthy, which sets it apart from most other pop-y songs that don't exceed four minutes. I know length's not everything in progressive music, but I don't think that's a detractor here.

Regardless, I'm sure this will get downvoted into oblivion like everything else I've posted on this particular thread because it fits outside of what a lot of you believe what is and isn't progressive. I don't mean to come off as pretentious with this next statement, but I like to believe I know what progressive music sounds like, seeing as I grew up on artists like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Yes, Jethro Tull and other great prog artists of the 70's."

"For my prog head friends - The Human Transcripition - Korean Language by Felix Martin","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_hhXZ48gc&amp;feature=youtu.be

This song is part of THE HUMAN TRANSCRIPTION. Several speeches, each in different languages, were converted into musical pieces by extracting the notes from their regular spoken voices. For fans of James Franco and Seth Rogans ""The Interview"".


In this instance, Korean is the language transcribed. It is important to note that the many different speakers in this composition all sound enthusiastic, and often speak from hi pitch to low pitch, or vice versa. Korean is very tonal and rhythmic, which made this transcription an enjoyable challenge. No modifications, alterations, or editing was done to the voice.

There are no political points of view or any other aspects associated with this project other than the extraction of melodies from the language and mood; in other words, to see how language and music naturally reflect.


Guitars - Felix Martin
Bass- Kilian Duarte
Drums- Phil Galatioto "
"For my prog head friends - The Human Transcripition - Korean Language by Felix Martin","Such a disappointment that this hasn't got much more hype than any other album out there. You deserve a big AMA in this site! Sadly people is too busy hearing the same 5 bands over and over again. 
Cheers from Spain Felix, such a groundbreaking project.

"Isis - Wills Dissolve","Been hit with the flu and Isis (as well as Cynic's newest have pretty much been on repeat) they're nice and heavy but they don't worsen the situation. Isis was just so amazing. Kinda bummed I got into them after they broke up. "

"Isis - Wills Dissolve","jeez, *The* Ocean ^^"

"Wide Eyes - Terraforming (2015 New Album Stream)","Haven't listened yet, but I've enjoyed a couple of the new tracks they had already put out. Samsara was a step up from Volume in that many of the tracks felt more distinct from each other, hoping this one continues that trend! 

Only one guest solo this time around (David Maxim Micic), will miss the extra ideas from others but it seems like everyone's so busy these days, must be hard to coordinate."

"[Animals as Leaders - The Woven Web] Cover, first time posting here","I think he is, just not very well and with awful technique. The thumb shouldn't be moving at all. If he was playing it perfectly, I'm sure the guitar wouldn't have been this low in the mix."
"[Animals as Leaders - The Woven Web] Cover, first time posting here","You're either really tight and spot on, or you could raise the volume from your guitar so that it sticks out just a bit more. Otherwise i must say i'm really jealous of that thumping technique of yours :/

"Steven Wilson's Hand. Cannot. Erase. has leaked.","Not posting a link since that's against the subreddit rules but I thought some of you would be interested.

Also, it's sounding pretty good so far; less poppy than the singles made it seem."
"Steven Wilson's Hand. Cannot. Erase. has leaked.","After a listen I REALLY like this one!
Reminds me of a more polished Insurgentes, or a fusion version of The Incident."
"Steven Wilson's Hand. Cannot. Erase. has leaked.","Contrary to many here, I've never been much of a Steven Wilson fan... But this sounds fantastic!"
"Steven Wilson's Hand. Cannot. Erase. has leaked.","Same! I'm not a fan at all but it's hard to dislike the instrumental parts, especially when Marco Minnemann and Guthrie Govan are a part of it."
"Steven Wilson's Hand. Cannot. Erase. has leaked.","That's probably a big contributor for me, the album feels far more vibrant than a lot of his other stuff for me."
"Steven Wilson's Hand. Cannot. Erase. has leaked.","Yeah, I noticed this just a few minutes ago. I'm not going to download it though, mostly because I like to buy the albums, and also because I don't mind waiting.

"Steven Wilson's Hand. Cannot. Erase. has leaked.","You and me both brother!"
"Steven Wilson's Hand. Cannot. Erase. has leaked.","He's coming closer to Porcupine Tree here. It's basically one half Steven Wilson as we know him, and a quarter each to early and late Porcupine Tree.

EDIT: Onto Happy Returns now. Gonna have to listen a few times, but this would go close to being the best thing Steven Wilson has ever done, across all of his work with all of his different bands."

"Steven Wilson's Hand. Cannot. Erase. has leaked.","Bought the album, but couldn't possibly wait. It's sounding very, very good so far. Need around 4-5 more listens before I can decide where exactly I place it in his discography, but it's definitely in the top end."

"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","I realize the clean vocals posts come up all the time here, but I realized today that sometimes I want to listen to some really heavy kickass prog metal, but with entirely (or almost entirely) clean vocals. The one song that I consider to be exactly what I want here is Porcupine Tree's ""Shallow"", but preferably a band where almost every song is like that. So what's your favorite proggy heavy metal band with minimal harsh vocals? "
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","Tesseract! One has some harsh vocals on it but I find it to be overall a much more heavier and emotional album than Altered State (which is still pretty damn good and entirely clean). 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGCn6g95PBY


Devin Townsend has been mentioned. He doesn't do much harsh vocal stuff these days and when he does it's usually very tasteful and minimal. Z2: Dark Matters has some very heavy riffs but also tends to lend itself to sounding ""grand"" before ""heavy"", if that makes sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9AcP3VHiak#t=2192


Katatonia's latest albums have had crazy heavy moments and use entirely clean vocals. They're not all that progressive though but still have great balance between heavy riffs and clean sections similar to Opeth in that respect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moZwgUex4aA


Breaking Orbit have some heavy stuff similar to that you'd find on a Tool album. It's not in your face heavy like Katatonia or filled with blast beats like Devin but it still counts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCE8DqZHjek


Caligula's Horse are slowly becoming a popular name here on /r/progmetal and in the progressive scene in general. They're great a mixing the heavier, at times djenty, riffs with wonderful clean passages. That and Jim Grey has the voice of an angel. Also check out his other band Arcane. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVvOPSupIsg


Destiny Potato. If you're familiar with David Maxim Micic's BILO EP's then you'll like this. It's his current full band project so think BILO heavy riffs + female singer. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_iGVxpeDmI


Demians is a one man project by Nicholas Chapel from France. He plays all the instruments, sings and engineers it all himself. Mute is a fantastic album that is incredible varied yet flows exceptionally. This song starts slow yet builds towards the end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfT_HjleDQ


Haken. Because we can't have a conversation about clean singing prog metal without mentioning Haken. They're like Dream Theater+.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8v_evgiS4

"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","You *have* to check out Caligula's Horse. I like their newest album more but they're both good. It's a little different so don't just write it off right away. Give it a couple listens, you won't be disappointed."
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","I discovered ""The Tide, the Thief and the River's End"" a few weeks back. I've hardly been listening to anything else since."

"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","while I prefer Dan over Ashe (both of them are fucking amazing), I couldn't help but notice that Dan has a lot of troubles hitting the really high notes from Altered State live. Especially Nocturne and Resist."
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","He hits notes that Ashe wouldn't even attempt live (literally). Ashe would sing the lower harmonies and blend in to the backing track, but Dan belts the high stuff and they use much less backing tracks with him."
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","Dan actually hits notes live, that Ashe couldn't hit. FROM THE ALBUM THAT ASHE SANG ON."
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","Ashe's melodies and harmonies were incredible, but there's no question that Dan is technically the better vocalist."

"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","And its just a fucking fantastic album on top of that.  Their best by far.  I wasn't sure how I felt when I heard it was all clean but the dual vocal harmony is amazing and the instrumentation just keeps getting better.  Top 5 of 2013 for me."

They are Kevin Moore (ex-Dream Theater keys), Michael Portnoy on a lot of the drums, and Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos (FW bassist Joe DiBiase is on a lot of their material, too). Moore's vox are so quiet they're almost whispered. They use a guest vocalist here and there, one of them being Mikael Åkerfeldt.

Speaking of Fates Warning, you need some of them, too.

"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","Just throwing some shit out there based on that porcupine tree song and what you said.  Warning: I'm a big fan of high-register male vocals and post-hardcore.  SO if you don't really like that, my list may not be that great.  

[I Am Abomination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTrBzvGmtBU).  Absolutely love this album (didn't really like the previous ones).  I don't think there's any screaming. 

[Artifex Pereo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tli453fW6yk).  One of my favorite bands right now.  It's more just progressive than progressive metal.  I would prefer progressive over metal if I had to choose, so that's why I love this band.  About 95% cleans.  

[Hail the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYlAaa3GhDE&amp;list=RDPYlAaa3GhDE).  Again, more progressive than metal, but they can get heavy.  What's even cooler is the drummer is singer.  Seeing him do that live is pretty incredible. About 80-85% cleans.  

Ohh yeah, [Intervals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Var6j5gD2qM)!  Some do not like the voice, but it's good enough for me.

Protest the Hero?  

Edit: I guess older [Dear Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqQ7kRj-vqY) stuff could be considered pretty progressive.  But again, not really metal.  "
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","Came here to mention I Am Abomination, they're top notch!"
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","[Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vluBFWv4mE) never use harsh vocals but still sound heavy as fuck."

"
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","The new contortionist album has a good mix of both but it seems to lean more towards clean vocals for most tunes. It's also just really beautiful. It's called ""language"""
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","Seconded. Language I isn't traditionally heavy, but there is totally a degree of heaviness there. The vocals are top."
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","As a fan of [Last Chance To Reason](http://youtu.be/rPE-OeriXTQ), I was pleasantly surprised when I heard Language. Michael Lessard is fantastic."

"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","I would say Tesseract. Also, certain Periphery songs fall into the category of ""heavy and mostly clean singing"""
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","[Haken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NdXqroDz9c#t=140) can get pretty heavy. "
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","Arguably Voivod, especially Nothingface, Angel Rat and The Outer Limits. The other albums are heavier still but also contain less prog."
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","I wouldn't say they got less prog, The Outer Limits has Jack Luminous on it, which was a pretty big deal for them."
"What is the heaviest band you can give me that uses almost entirely clean vocals?","Ok, a lot of bands have already been covered, but I think I have a few new ones...

"PROTEST THE HERO Frontman Rody Walker's Hilarious ASKING ALEXANDRIA Audition","I totally get that, I just personally think it was kinda uncool of a guy in a band to decide to make a video to make fun of another band just because he doesn't like them. Apparently this is an unpopular opinion!"
"PROTEST THE HERO Frontman Rody Walker's Hilarious ASKING ALEXANDRIA Audition","Its a completely valid opinion:)"
"PROTEST THE HERO Frontman Rody Walker's Hilarious ASKING ALEXANDRIA Audition","you are so right man, that's generally why i like the prog community cause most of them seems reasonable and accept all kinds of music genres. I do love rody and PTH I've would probably like this video if he didn't make fun of a specific band."
"PROTEST THE HERO Frontman Rody Walker's Hilarious ASKING ALEXANDRIA Audition","Dude, I like metalcore, and ""real"" metal of all types....but I still can't stand this band."

Old avenged sevenfold is great.

Old trivium is great.

AA is fucking HORRENDOUS."
"PROTEST THE HERO Frontman Rody Walker's Hilarious ASKING ALEXANDRIA Audition","I jam ABR and ETID daily. Fuckin solid bands."
"PROTEST THE HERO Frontman Rody Walker's Hilarious ASKING ALEXANDRIA Audition","AA's newest album isn't half bad tbh. Their vocalist has come a *long* way."
"PROTEST THE HERO Frontman Rody Walker's Hilarious ASKING ALEXANDRIA Audition","That's fine, and I can see why you do (there is plenty of metalcore out there that I like way more than AA), I just thought that a guy in a band making a video making fun of another band just comes off as mean spirited. Apparently other people here do not agree. "
"PROTEST THE HERO Frontman Rody Walker's Hilarious ASKING ALEXANDRIA Audition","I hear what you're saying, and it's a valid opinion, but it's pretty innocent stuff. My intent certainly wasn't malicious, just a little (in my opinion) harmless fun.

I certainly did not expect it to garner the attention that it has."
"PROTEST THE HERO Frontman Rody Walker's Hilarious ASKING ALEXANDRIA Audition","I hear ya, it wasn't that bad all things considered. Thanks for taking the time to reply."

"Piano solos from Tim of PTH including the interlude from Spoils","This is going to seem like a dick comment, so I'll be complimentary first: I like the composition. The ascending arpeggios are nice, have enough movement and the addition of color tones that are allowed to ring give the chords a great feel beyond just the basic major/minor tonality. He does a good job of voicing to some extent as well, really bringing out the melody notes.

That being said, it would be nice to hear a recording with someone who can play evenly, both in terms of getting rid of the rhythmic unevenness, and with some more shaping of the line beyond ""melody notes BANG LOUD"". On Spoils, it sounds really nice, I'm assuming because of a bunch of quantization of the midi piano, would have been nice to hear it like that, but with a more organic live touch and resonance from the grand they recorded on."
"Piano solos from Tim of PTH including the interlude from Spoils","This is exactly how I felt. Tim definitely can compose some piano pieces, but his dynamic tendencies don't improve the music."
"Piano solos from Tim of PTH including the interlude from Spoils","I appreciate the feedback. Definitely the original recording of Isosceles was recorded in midi and after the performance quantized and everything snapped to the grid. With this recording, I wanted it to be a little more real and unedited. Aside from it being hard to edit piano without making it sound edited, I didn't really want to have this edited to sound 100% perfect. This was definitely an example of listening back to something and not being 100% happy with it but I thought it had some character.  

I would agree with you that my playing could be refined and I probably could have spent a lot more time getting the perfect takes. It definitely is a little sloppy and falls off the grid a touch.  Anyway, on the next batch hopefully I'll have some more time and can put in a better performance.

Thanks for checking it out and for all the nice things you said about the tune.
-- Tim"
"Piano solos from Tim of PTH including the interlude from Spoils","Wow, thanks for stopping by to respond! I completely agree about the difficulty with editing piano, the resonance of the instrument makes it so hard to get a clear enough break in sound to make a cut. I recently finished up recording a piano trio ep and and having to record larger sections to get to stopping points makes it so much more stressful, especially since 'studio' stuff is supposed to be note perfect, makes it hard to focus on musicality when you're so worried about just the technical accuracy. When I was sending in auditions for grad programs and jobs and whatnot, I always would just use live performance videos, since then it'd be okay to have the occasional mistake ;) I'm not consistent enough for studio work, when I record I usually just say 'screw it' and [use the take with the best average playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzre9s1lCMc).

Do you happen to have a transcription/sheet music to Isosceles? Not that I'm trying to turn this into a dick-measuring contest, I would just genuinely like to see the layout of the arpeggios, like I said I really like the colors it added, figured I might save some time asking before I delved into transcribing anything!

Thank YOU for making such cool music!

So many 'modern' guitar guys are playing these instruments that it will influence the buying decision of a beginnee kid who's listening to all this music.

"There's more Animals As Leaders, and you haven't heard it.","If you're as much of an AAL addict as me, there being more Animals As Leaders music somewhere out there totally new to you is a pretty exciting concept, and it might well be the case. There's an ever growing collection of music by Tosin Abasi, Javier Reyes, Matt Gartska and Navene Koperweis lurking on the internets. If you missed out on one or more of these, hopefully you'll find something new you love. If I've missed anything, let me know. 

* [REFLUX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e73z1gy1Ks) (Abasi) - Not my sort of thing but this is Tosin in the early days; interesting to see his roots. 

* WAVE OF BABIES (AAL) - This is fairly well known, but a great AAL track released before Weightless that doesn't feature on any album. [Check out the live performance at EMGtv.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt-RoSzsEKA) 

* [OPTIMIST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4gTgM0UepQ) &amp; [PESSIMIST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UItUYIwkFcc) (Abasi) - Two standalone tracks released by Abasi and Misha Mansoor around Joy of Motion time and with some similar vibes to both that record and Periphery. 

* [MESTIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lBOgvLam90&amp;list=PLH22-xSMERQrgi1kWmox2vvoJ2o-z0scd) (Reyes) - A solo project by Javier under the alias Mestis, with one album out (and possibly the only one that will ever be released?) called Basal Ganglia. Clocking in around the 20 minute mark, it's short and sweet. Really sweet  in fact, this is one of my favourite albums with heavy AAL influence and some of Javier's unique Latin jazz flavour that crept into the Joy of Motion album in tracks like Para Mexer. [Check out the live performance of Tomato- sorry, Te Mato at EMGtv.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Ps3q_DbUw) 

* [TRAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBX8an0PY5c&amp;list=PLC82B49CF43E5229D) (Abasi+Reyes) - Basically a prog supergroup that wrote a jazz album called Lingua Franca and it's fucking awesome. Again, definite moments in here that have a very AAL feel to them. 

* [NAVENE-K](http://navenek.bandcamp.com/music) (Koperweis) - Solo project undertaken by Koperweis when he parted ways with AAL after production of Weightless. This stuff is quite different to AAL with electronic and percussion driven music with a minimalist angle. Some sick drops, beast mode drumming and the keen ear can pick out some lingering AAL influence in the melodies. 

* [ENTHEOS](http://www.metalsucks.net/2015/01/05/entheos-former-members-faceless-animals-leaders-launch-new-project/) (Koperweis) - Bookmark it, favourite it, write it down, set it add your damn desktop background, whatever. Navene has formed a new band that have a first EP to release in the near future, and you don't want to forget about it. They've finished making it from what I can gather and the promo clip glaring around somewhere out in the ether sounds dope. Be ready for this shit.

* [FLESHWROUGHT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZGljDQmavE) (Koperweis) - A band in a very different area of metal to AAL but featuring Navene's monstrous drumming.

* [ANIMOSITY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvMplYSUCWY) - Another pre-AAL band featuring Koperweis. Deathcore fans rejoice.

* [TWO MAN TRIO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuEHZ6pNx4c) (Gartska) - Some crazy musicianship going on here. Matt's outstanding rhythms and a dude playing bass and keyboard simultaneously, hence Two Man Trio. 

* [HYPHENS](https://clyp.it/j12wobas) (AAL) - A demo for Weightless. Probably the earliest collaborative work for AAL out there, the first album being written by Abasi alone. You can spot moments in here that would later be used in the track Weightless, a very cool listen. While we're at it, [a demo of The Price Of Everything And The Value Of Nothing can be heard here.](https://clyp.it/dwkt1cyo)

* AAL EXTRAS - There's a [vocal cover of Behaving Badly by Kelela Mizanekrostos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baEuKEDw72E), and it's really cool. The original is nice to watch, but there's also a [remastered version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDb9R3Pv7w) by an AAL fan that improves the sound significantly. There's also a [Behaving Badly &amp; The Price Of Everything And The Value Of Nothing medley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnlXhTksH-w) they play live and there's a drum cam of it on YouTube. 

These are all easy to find on Google, hopefully I've introduced you to something new here. Here's to hoping for a fourth AAL album! 

"
"There's more Animals As Leaders, and you haven't heard it.","I have a demo version of the song Weightless that was released even before the self-titled. I also have a demo of the Price of Everything but it doesn't differ very much from the album version. I'll upload them when I get home from work!  

Here are the two demos I have, I believe I got them from PureVolume a long time ago.

[Animals as Leaders - Hyphens (Weightless demo)](https://clyp.it/j12wobas)  
[Animals as Leaders - 1st Idea (The Price of Everything and Value of Nothing demo](https://clyp.it/dwkt1cyo)

I was actually really disappointed that the bit at 4:21 in Hyphens was only used once in the studio version of Weightless. That was what made the song for me, honestly.
  
Some other interesting things:  

* Navene is either sampling or using the same effect from Do Not Go Gently in [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G5sSbTEBWU)  
  
* Bulb posted almost the entire self-titled album nearly four months before its release [in this thread.](http://smnnews.com/board/showthread.php?t=198139) I still remember hearing Tempting Time for the first time and being absolutely mind fucked.
  
* Reflux was also comprised of Evan Brewer on bass and Ash Avildsen (CEO of Sumerian Records) on vocals.

* Navene also played in one of the earliest and greatest deathcore bands of all time, [Animosity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Psk61luXiE). Evan Brewer played bass with them as well."

Nothing but love for present and past members. "
"There's more Animals As Leaders, and you haven't heard it.","Reflux was my favorite band when I was 17. Hearing Tosin play live for the first time totally blew my mind. He was only about 20 at the time. My band played with them a couple times. Back then he wasn't famous yet, so he was super cool and would always spend a bunch of time talking to me about guitar, and technique, and what he was listening to. He was (and still is) a huge inspiration to my playing."

"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Hey, /r/progmetal, after browsing in a few other subs, it's come to my attention that we don't have any sort of collaborative music sharing thing going on, with the exception of our (awesome) Hall of Fame. 

So, I'd like to propose we make a couple Spotify playlists:

1. A playlist for newcomers as well as those looking to get into other bands, featuring material from our Hall of Fame Selections and a few other popular songs by artists perhaps not in the Hall, and

2. An /r/progmetal 2015 playlist, featuring new/recent material from anywhere in progmetal that we'll update as the year goes by. 

We'll vote on suggestions in this thread, and I'll keep updating the list as suggestions pass.

**EDIT 2: THIS OP HAS CLASS TOMORROW, AND MUST SLEEP. FORTUNATELY FOR YOU, OP WILL BE UP AT 4 AM PACIFIC STANDARD TIME TO CURATE YOUR SUGGESTIONS. OP LOVES YOU ALL. Also, I'd appreciate some All New Material (djent djoke, sorry) so I can begin compiling the 2015 playlist. Thanks, /r/progmetal. We're making something awesome :D**

**EDIT 3:** Okay, everyone, I'm back in action! I've gotten a crap ton of suggestions for the introductory playlist, and it's freakin sweet. I think it's time we start compiling a list for songs made within the last year– 2014-present– as our ongoing 2015 list.

**EDIT 4: OP HAS RETURNED.** Back to the grind.

**EDIT 5: [I've published the playlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2wt2y8/lets_make_an_rprogmetal_2015_spotify_playlist/).** Definitely still a work in progress, but that's what we've got so far. I'm going to stop updating this thread, so work can continue in the [new thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2wy40j/okay_rprogmetal_heres_the_playlist_ive_compiled/) where I've posted the playlist. *Thanks for all your help, guys! :D*"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Ne Obliviscaris should definitely be Painters of the Tempest (Part II): Triptych Lux.

Haken: Pareidolia, Celestial Elixir or Visions.

Destiny Potato: Indifferent

I wish I knew more about the other bands to help out."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","You've helped enough :D

Thanks for contributing!"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","&gt; Pareidolia

Seconding this for Haken. Visions is stellar but too long for an intro mix IMO"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","As cheesy as it may be, I really enjoy Arrow + Knww = Adventure Over by Sithu Aye. It's hard for me to remember song names that are instumental, so there may be better songs that other people could nominate."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","This has been recommended more than once, so I'll have to take your word for it- it's going on the list!"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I nominate Steven Wilson's ""Ancestral"" as a track in the 2015 playlist. "
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Oh right, I'd say you should have a playlist that's exclusively clean vocals for people who want to get into the genre but (like me) don't dig the growling. "
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Then help me get some songs together :)

I'd love some suggestions for clean bands. I know Haken is mostly clean, and I think Chon(?). We can divide up the main playlist by vocals, like this sub breaks up posts."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Bigger bands:

Dream Theater

Porcupine Tree

Tool

TesseracT's Second album

Recent Opeth

Some Periphery songs

Haken

Karnivool

Some lesser known bands:

Jolly

In the Presence of Wolves

Dream the Electric Sleep

Thank You Scientist


Just a starting point, there's a ton more. "
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Already have most of those; thanks for reminding me of Karnivool and ITPOW especially. Could you recommend a couple songs for the newcomer-friendly list?

Edit: I'm stupid; I forgot this was you. Thanks, anyway, though :D"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Wonderful idea!

If you're interested Dream Theater made a playlist some time ago with the big names: https://play.spotify.com/user/dreamtheaterofficial/playlist/1bp91GYL09nbf1runqSE0v

"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","...they made a playlist titled Prog Metal Mastery and put themselves on it. I don't even know what to say."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I call that the Kanye West effect"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I don't get the hate on Dream Theater. Their recent stuff is a bit meh, but their earlier works are really nice. They were also the first band this subreddit included in the hall of fame."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Yeah let's do it bois. my favs/suggestions:

Protest the Hero

Periphery

Chon

Sithu Aye

The Helix Nebula

Devin Townsend

Plini

TesseracT

Tool

Between the Buried and Me

Animals as Leaders

Anup Sastry

Other stuffs???
"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","HAKEN!"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Okay, so out of the bands you listed that I know, I'm going to start listing songs for each:

PTH - [C'est La Vie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKZ-eKBJ9dw)

Periphery - [Ragnarok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyHFVtgsCzI)

TesseracT - [Lament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C99SU-IjYQ)

Devin Townsend - [Kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nubJjB95VdY)

Tool - [Ænema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCEeAn6_QJo)

BTBAM - [Swim to the Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhkpCjmXHTU) (might be too long for newcomers to get into, though, so I'm not sure)

AAL - [CAFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfzWpp0hMc)

And, aside from that, I think bands that deserve mention are:


* Ne Obliviscaris

* Monuments

* Vildhjarta

* Sikth

* Haken

* Mastodon

* Gojira

* Porcupine Tree

* Cynic

* Meshuggah

* After the Burial

* Veil of Maya

* Corelia

* (Shorter songs by) Dream Theater

* The Human Abstract

* Glasscloud

* Destiny Potato

* Red Seas Fire

* Reflux

* Chimp Spanner

* Cloudkicker

And that's all I can think of for now, but more will come later, rest assured.

All the song suggestions I put up are up for debate, so if you have any recommendations, then please let me know! I think this assortment would best suit a ""Getting into Prog"" or ""Best Of Prog"" playlist, rather than a 2015 playlist. Just my opinion."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Don't forget about the old schoolers!  Symphony X and Blind Guardian.  Angra is another good one, though might lean more towards power metal.  Planet X &amp; Liquid Tension Experiment for those who want their instrumental fix.  Not necessarily metal, but The Mars Volta shouldn't be overlooked.  Ayreon for sure as well.  "
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","My suggestions for classic late 80s/mid 90s:

&amp;nbsp;

Dream Theater - Metropolis Pt 1 

Fates Warning - Guardian

Psychotic Waltz - Into The Everflow

Death - Crystal Mountain

Cynic - Veil of Maya

Symphony X - Of Sins And Shadows

Atheist - Unquestionable Presence

Threshold - Paradox

Voivod - Le Pont Noir

Neurosis - Souls At Zero

Mekong Delta - Heartbeat

Opeth - Under The Weeping Moon

Devin Townsend - Seventh Wave

Queensryche - Revolution Calling

Anacrusis - Sound The Alarm

&amp;nbsp;

I tried to keep it under ten minutes. Thanks for nothing, Opeth."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Haha, awesome! Gonna add these to the list for sure. I was confused for a second but then remembered that Veil of Maya got their name from the Cynic song. I appreciate your help.

Also, I should be shot for forgetting Neurosis (at least Scott's in Crack the Skye, though) and Opeth.

EDIT: I'm sorry, but I might not be including Death. I understand they were progressive as hell, and completely fucking amazing, but they just seemed to click better with a different movement. I hope you understand &lt;/3"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","""bubble dream"" by Chon.
we should hit a two birds with one stone with ""moonrise"" by Sithu Aye and Plini (it was on a collaborative EP they did).
I don't know why Intervals hasn't been included but ""Epiphany"". I like ""obzen"" by Meshuggah but I like ""New Millennium Cyanide Christ"" a lot better.
Maybe some Born of Osirirs, I was thinking ""Absolution"".
A progressive metal list does need some Rush so I was thinking ""YYZ"".
 "
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I love BOO, as well, and I was considering putting Follow the Signs or XIV+Behold, or maybe even Automatic Motion.

EDIT: Holy shit, Intervals! They totally slipped my mind. I think I'll go with Tapestry from their first album, but I'm not sure what to use from their second album."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I for one cannot wait to listen to this playlist! 


As for Plini might I suggest [Selinium Forest](http://youtu.be/5fNhD_lP1F4) 

And for Dream Theater [Panic Attack](http://youtu.be/5hDs6mCVAKs)

*Edit: I love Opeth and Orchid and Under The Weeping Moon as need much as the next person, but is that really the best song we can think of to represent their sound and get people into them? Maybe [The Leper Affinity](http://youtu.be/9xRPG0-qVks) or [Reverie/Harlequin Forest](http://youtu.be/nIo3lpXrc5A) 

Also, can we add both Maudlin of the Well and David Maxim Micic to the list? [The Blue Ghost/Shedding Qliphoth](http://youtu.be/S2lEROcrYjc) by Maudlin is breathtaking. As is [Smile](http://youtu.be/6LZ40VkdHuI) by Micic. :) "
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I think Maudlin of the Well was already suggested, so like I've already said about ninety times in this thread, I'll consider it for sure. I think I'll stick with Pull Me Under for DT, but I'll definitely add some other songs by them into the list. As for Opeth, same. And thanks for the Plini suggestion! I haven't heard many for them."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Here's some:

SikTh

Meshuggah

The Contortionist

Cynic

Last Chance to Reason

Vildhjarta"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Cool, thanks. I replied to another comment with a more full list of the bands I wanted (I forgot TC!) in the playlist for getting into prog metal. If you can offer any song suggestions, I'd appreciate it! :D"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I nominate:

The Safety Fire - Glass Crush

Irepress - Diaspora

Scale the Summit - Odyssey

Jolly - Firewell

"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Jolly seconded. Joy is my personal favorite of theirs. What a great band. "
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I love Scale the Summit! Thanks for your other suggestions, too; I really appreciate it!"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Exotic Animal Petting Zoo and The Safety Fire.

I do not believe Chon belongs up there."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Thanks for the suggestions! I've opted to keep Chon, since they seem to be a popular choice in this sub, although I personally do not listen to them very much myself. Safety Fire is great, though, and I'll probably put Exotic Animal Petting Zoo up there because I know they have some fans here."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Some extra song suggestions since you asked:

Monuments - I, the Creator (if you're going for new, if you want older I suggest Degenerate ^or ^both...)

Sikth - Hold my Finger

Glasscloud - She is Well and Nothing Can Be Ill

Anup Sastry - Nemesis

These are songs that I find to be high quality, and representative of those bands while not being their most popular. Hope it helps."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","You're awesome :)

I just started listening to Monuments, but wasn't so sure if I wanted something from The Amanuensis or maybe a little older, so I'll take your word on that second suggestion. Thanks so much!"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","For Porcupine Tree - either Trains or Blackest Eyes for newcomers.

"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Thanks! I was going to go for Anesthize, but it *is* quite long. Trains is awesome (PT is awesome in general, but you know what I mean)."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","It's a tough choice. I once made an into to progressive rock mix CD.... let me dig up the list. "
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Okay, so I lied about going to bed right now, and I'm going to reply to you. I'll probably hit the lights before you find it, so thanks in advance and I'm anxious to see that list tomorrow morning :D"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","It is apparently only saved on my ipod, which is in my car in the garage.... since I am going to bed now too it won't be until tomorrow that I can retrieve it. "
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","This thread needs way more [Oceansize.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFkyrRqzkIQ)

"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Wow, what a great sound! Very unique."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Glad you enjoyed!  They did 4 albums, a handful of EPs and a live collection that is absolutely must-have. Unfortunately, they self-destructed a few years ago and are no longer together.  Quite possibly my favorite band noone has heard.  No two albums are alike!"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Interesting sound. Very cool."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Glad you enjoyed!  They're one of my favorite bands.  Choosing one song was pretty difficult.  Ask me again tomorrow and I may pick a completely different one."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","And The Ocean"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Song Suggestions:

The Helix Nebula: Sea of Suns

Destiny Potato: Indifferent

"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Get some Fellsilent in there! Oh, and Cloudkicker!"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Bands I think are missing from the list: 

* Pain of Salvation
* Persefone
* Pan.Thy.Monium
* Ayreon
* Orphaned Land
* Sigh
* Kayo Dot
* Maudlin of the Well
* Sleepytime Gorilla Museum
* Unexpect"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Yo, I'll be honest, I only know Ayreon, Unexpect, and Pain of Salvation out of that list. But I'll see if this gets some positive feedback and I'll definitely consider throwing them in. Any song recs for those bands?"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Difficult to pick tracks, but here are some recommendations:

* [Persefone - Consciousness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_LtFlqBtuU) (Unfortunately split into two tracks on Spotify.)

* [Pan.Thy.Monium - Thee-Perenth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfPKfHpaZyY) (A very underrated band. One of the first progressive death metal bands ever, doing some really proggy stuff in the early 90s.)

* [Orphaned Land - Halo Dies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xgxQR78wM) (A very unique Israeli band mixing progressive metal and middle eastern folk music.)

* [Sigh - Equale I) Prelude II) Fugato III) Coda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVkQzE8vsVE)(Probably Japan's most famous experimental/prog metal band.)

* [Kayo Dot - The Manifold Curiosity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik-Fp2defYk)

* [Maudlin of the Well - Secret Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnLX1y2G8-w)

* [Sleepytime Gorilla Museum - Babydoctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7FeVPoMlC0)

There are loads of other great bands one could add too of course. These are just some of the ones I missed the most."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Okay, I'll check these out for sure! Going to start assembling a playlist on Spotify now, so I'll add these in as I get the chance to listen to them."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","[Chon - Fluffy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEsdAIQwphE) has been one of my favourites from them :)"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Thanks! I believe this one was already suggested, too, so I'll take it into serious consideration!"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Skyharbor - Allure"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I've heard that one. I think I'll use it."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I nominate Rush's FULL 2112 Suite , The Odyssey by Symphony X and if you want a longer song by Dream Theater then I nominate DT's Octavarium  "
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I was actually going for shorter, newcomer-friendly songs as an intro to prog. But thank you for your suggestion anyway."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Ok then , how bout Another Day or The Answer Lies Within or even The Dark Eternal Night"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I don't agree with A Wolf Among Ravens for After The Burial. I'd recommend Pennyweight or Neo Soul because they have a bit more variety.  Although, that's only my opinion. Cool list, none the less!

Also, I'd recommend Dysphoria (or the weather front song from Subsume if you want something newer) for Cloudkicker. "
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Harken: Atlas Stone. Visions and Pareidolia

Cynic: Veil of maya, Carbon-based anatomy, Integral Birth

Chon: Bubble dream, Dew, Fluffy
Those are my suggestions!

Also! I'd suggest some The Mars Volta aswell! Goliath, Cotopaxi, Roulette Dares(the haunt of)

Edit: Formatting."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Mars Volta is going for up for sure, and I already have Veil of Maya for Cynic. Thanks for your other suggestions, though, I didn't really have anywhere to start with Chon!"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I've noticed a couple of mentions of Karnivool but no one's suggested any songs. 
I think either Themata or New Day. 
Themata is a bit less progressive but is a good introduction to the band but I think New Day, as a song, has everything."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Thanks! I'm not much of a Karnivool listener, so the suggestions are appreciated."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I'd say New day, Themata and We Are. :)"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I'd throw a few more in:

**Distorted Harmony** - Kono Yume

**Caligula's Horse** - A Gift To Afterthought

**The Mars Volta** - Day Of The Baphomets

**Pain Of Salvation** - A Trace Of Blood

**Riverside** - Second Life Syndrome

**Seventh Wonder** - Welcome To Mercy Falls

Each song is the one that got me into the band so for that reason I think they'd all be good picks. Especially Caligula's Horse, I reaaally like that one right now"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I'll definitely throw in Caligula's Horse, Riverside, and Pain of Salvation. I'm not sure about the other bands, though."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Man Distorted Harmony is definitely worth the listen. Kono Yume is what got me into them, and their album they released last year was really well done. Every Time She Smiles is one of their new album or As One. "
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Chimpspanner - [Under One Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNJBYW2SKjQ)

Would you guys stretch to The Mars Volta at all? I know it's not strictly 'prog-metal, but I love [Viscera Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4K_PHn21dc)"
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Mars Volta is prog enough for most of us in here, so I'd say yes."

Sithu Aye - Hypatia

These songs in my opinion show case these artists the best."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I love Cypher! RSF's first album was as good as debuts get."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Are we limiting it to one per artist? Seems a bit restrictive when a lot of artists have such phenomenal discographies."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","No. I'm just not very good at updating every artist with YouTube links when I'm ultimately trying to make a Spotify playlist. I'm going to consider 1-3 songs for each artist with a few exceptions."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","Some suggestions I have are:

More examples of Meshuggah since they are such founding fathers to the genre and have so much material. On top of Obzen I would add a track off Contradictions Collapse [(Humiliative?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAPn8Jz6qL8) and one off Koloss [(Demiurge?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xD-KJSjIxw).

Something by [The Ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba7y1ZYFODw).

And maybe some [Deftones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTPn4Jlrjb0) for being prog-pioneers as well."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I'll for sure get some more Meshuggah on there. I've been super-busyish over the last couple days and will update the playlist ASAP."
"Let's make an /r/progmetal 2015 Spotify playlist!","I don't know if I would consider them prog, perhaps more stoner/sludge power trio rock, but they have a ton of prog tendencies, so I'm going to go with it.

If King's X is prog-metal, so is this.  (And I love King's X.)

"Fates Warning - Pieces Of Me",""
"Fates Warning - Pieces Of Me","I love this album. 

Still remains is one of my favorite songs, especially the intro and outro to  it."
"Fates Warning - Pieces Of Me","agreed, though this one is probably my second fav from the album"
"Fates Warning - Pieces Of Me","Probably my favorite album of theirs. Definitely need to re-listen to it tomorrow."
"Fates Warning - Pieces Of Me","I think this is the first time I've seen a Fates Warning song that isn't on their first four albums. It surprises me that their later material (like this) isn't posted more often because it is some fantastic stuff."
"Fates Warning - Pieces Of Me","Agreed. Honestly, I think this album and FWX are my favorites. Another Perfect Day is an awesome song."
"Fates Warning - Pieces Of Me","Man what a task it is to narrow down a favourite Fates Warning album. I simply can't do it, they're all so good and different.

I'll have to listen to FWX more, I just picked it up late last year and have only heard it a few times. I do remember it impressing me though."
"Fates Warning - Pieces Of Me","I like it quite a bit. I kind of just jumped straight into Fates Warning and downloaded their whole discography in one fell swoop and had no idea where to start, and FWX was one of the first albums to immediately grab me. It's not mindblowingly awesome or anything like that but the songs are catchy and well-enough written that they were able to stick with me long enough to hold my interest before I got to meatier albums."
"Fates Warning - Pieces Of Me","I'm going to listen to FWX right now. Since we've been talking about it, I've realized I could use more Fates Warning in my life. Such a great band, always willing to switch it up and make something brand new and awesome with every release.

Have you heard their latest album yet? I've only heard songs here and there. That one and Night on Brocken are the only albums I haven't heard in full. I'm really looking forward to one day finally listening to Darkness in a Different Light, I've only heard good to great things about it."
"Fates Warning - Pieces Of Me","Actually no I haven't - FWX is their most recent one that I've listened to. I'm going to go have to go track that down and give it a shot when I get home from work! Thanks for the heads up!"
"Fates Warning - Pieces Of Me","No problem, but don't take my word for it as I'm just going on other people's opinions and the few tracks I've heard. It could still be a stinker... Nah, this is Fates Warning we're talking about, there are no stinkers!

FYI, FWX is really impressing me again. No tracks are really standing out individually to me but the album as a whole is just beautiful."
"Fates Warning - Pieces Of Me","Yeah, that's kind of how I felt about it too. None of the songs really struck me as particularly incredible on their own, but there's a definite degree of consistency that most albums don't pull off - I can't think of any songs on that album that I *don't* like off the top of my head, and like I said earlier, I still find myself singing Another Perfect Day in my head pretty often."
"Fates Warning - Pieces Of Me","It's a really spectacular album for how consistent it is. There isn't a weak moment, I was digging it all the way through and it kept drawing me in again and again. My attention didn't stray despite being distracted on the Internet.

Thanks for getting me to listen again. I would have eventually, but it made my Friday just that much more enjoyable."

This will be the central hub for discussing this album. 

As usual when we link to an official album stream, songs from the album will be barred from posting for the duration that the thread is stickied. Those who make the argument that this inhibits discussion are without grounds--this thread will contain comments for every individual song on the album(s) so that there can be threaded discussion for them if people desire that. Also, general self-posts regarding the album will remain admissible, though we recommend people use this thread if at all possible. "
"Official Discussion Thread for Periphery's Juggernaut (full album stream included)","One thread of conversation I'd like to have is identifying thematic elements that recur, or any similar passages between the songs. There's been a couple obvious ones so far that I'll put at the top of this list, feel free to let me know when you find more, and I'll edit them into this post with credit! Bonus points for obscurity ;)

EDIT: Now with links to timestamps, check it out for yourself! Always interesting to see the context of each reference, placements in the individual songs and the albums as a whole, rather than just hearing random snippets of music and not knowing where in the song they came from. I've added others' contributions, feel free to let me know if you find more, I'm super curious. I tried to arrange the list so that songs that are tied together are grouped together consecutively on the list, rather than jumping around willy nilly, but there's still some jumping. If you don't wish to click all the links I've embedded, /u/Oglethorppe has streamlined the process and compiled [many of them into a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCEStZIzdpY&amp;feature=youtu.be).


1.) **A Black Minute/Reprise/The Scourge/Psychosphere** - [Black Minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDDZyf3qzVw#t=40) and [Reprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayHDT6XC27g#t=28) have the same opening vocal melodies, which also appears in the [opening section of Psychosphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRBkVp_bB_E#t=61), as well as 
in a slightly more cheerful form at the end of The Scourge (around 4:20). Sorry, can't link to the stream for The Scourge, the youtube version cuts out the last minute or so! -credit in part to /u/hoosiermetal, pointed out Psychosphere to add to the list!

2.) **A Black Minute/Reprise/Omega** - In the opening section to A Black Minute, the [vocal melody at 1:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDDZyf3qzVw#t=59) has the lyric ""Embrace the feeling of our human skin"". In Reprise, this melody [shows up at 1:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayHDT6XC27g#t=65) with the lyrics ""I'll learn the feeling of a soul within"". Finally, the melody makes another appear appearance in [Omega at 9:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MQiuc06jIU#t=559), this final time with the line ""Embrace the feeling of a soul within"". This especially is interesting showing the character's change and growth through the story. -credit to /u/Oglethorppe for the heads up, although I had to do some of the grunt work tracking it down in Reprise ;)

3.) **A Black Minute/Graveless/Priestess** - The outro section [beginning at 3:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDDZyf3qzVw#t=203) in A Black Minute is also heard towards the [end of the bridge in Graveless at 2:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx4TCGGMRJE#t=164). At first it's sort of buried under all the vocal layers, but you can pick it out as recognizable. Furthermore, this reappears quietly right at the [end of Priestess at 4:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8SvF8MLrHI#t=277), just a single guitar line playing the melody softly. Cool find! -credit to /u/amongstravens and zac tiessen, along with /u/ntLKM adding additional info.

4.) **Reprise/Heavy Heart/Rainbow Gravity** - First appearing in the lead guitar line [around 1:05 in Heavy Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEygCZ4LrEA#t=67), the motive reappears behind the vocals in Rainbow Gravity during the choruses (first heard quietly buried in the [mix at 1:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POtsMdLISs#t=99), and much more [prominently at 3:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POtsMdLISs#t=232)). Later in the albums, it shows up again at [:36 in Reprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayHDT6XC27g#t=39), beginning on the words ""Death has come"". -credit to /u/randyoung for helping me flesh out this entry!

5.) **Psychosphere/The Scourge/Four Lights** - The epic explosion [at 2:30 in The Scourge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VURtvVKyGU#t=149) brings with it an angular, stepwise, and steadily pulsing guitar melody. This melody comes back in a big way at the [end of Four Lights, at 1:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fji7XbhQ-P0#t=101). This is interesting that this section in Four Lights has a melody from The Scourge, but a rhythm guitar part that comes back in Omega (see next entry). Finally, there is another quick appearance of this melody [in Psychosphere at 4:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRBkVp_bB_E#t=256). At 4:08, there is a break where a guitar plucks single notes with delay, when this phrase repeats at 4:16 the recurring melody is added in. -credit to /u/hazgarv and /u/ntLKM

6.) **Four Lights/Omega** - The rhythmic riff at [1:40 in Four Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fji7XbhQ-P0#t=101) shows up in a faster version subdivided in 16ths rather than triplets at [1:30 in Stranger Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYy6_3bem_g#t=90). -credit to /u/Oglethorppe

7.) **Omega/Alpha** - [Chorus from Alpha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-BFadGJ3Kc#t=55) occurs again at the [end of Omega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MQiuc06jIU#t=608).

8.) **Alpha/The Bad Thing** - In The Bad Thing, the vocal lines [""fly past the trees, ascend to holy air and breath""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sNIbcqxYL0#t=73) occur in Alpha [during the growled bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-BFadGJ3Kc#t=219). They have been changed to add a word, to ""fly past the *withered* trees, ascend to holy air and breath"". -credit to /u/Oglethorppe

9.) **The Bad Thing/22 Faces** - In 22 Faces, a vocal line in the bridge [""Tearing a hole inside, I'll bury your life""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUeWJjZB_nQ#t=152) appears as well in the [chorus to The Bad Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sNIbcqxYL0#t=119). -credit to /u/Oglethorppe

10.) **22 Faces/Stranger Things** - The vocal [chorus to 22 Faces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUeWJjZB_nQ#t=44) shows up at around [2:06 in Stranger Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYy6_3bem_g#t=125). The melody is modified just a tiny bit, but it's generally the same intervals and in the same key.

11.) **Stranger Things/Psychosphere** - [Psychosphere at 2:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRBkVp_bB_E#t=141) has a harmonized vocal line ""sadistic aura"" that reappears in [Stranger Things at 3:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYy6_3bem_g#t=219). Same vocal melody and layered harmonies, but the words have changed to ""majestic aura"". Pretty cool that the opening and closing tracks of each album have elements in common with each other. -credit to /u/Oglethorppe, and /u/blakarmor725 for a bit of correction

12.) **Sranger Things/A Black Minute** - Aaaand we're back to the beginning. As a bunch of people have figured out by now, there certainly is a sense of cyclical storytelling going on in the albums (see /u/jardantuan 's post below for one such lyrical example), and that is reinforced by the 'music box' elements. The final [25 seconds or so of Stranger Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYy6_3bem_g#t=426) are in fact the 'forward' played version of the reversed sample that is the [very opening of A Black Minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDDZyf3qzVw&amp;list=PLH22-xSMERQp9Jq_FLpgQ57BHZEm132Nz).  -Credit to /u/jardantuan and /u/iAmTheEpicOne

13.) **Alpha/Priestess** - Near the [end of Alpha at 4:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-BFadGJ3Kc#t=270), the lyrics ""Step out in the rain, feel life in our veins"" sort of reappear near the [end of Priestess at 3:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8SvF8MLrHI#t=237), although changed to ""Step out in the rain and feel the deep sorrow"". -credit to /u/SpongebobCuntpants

14.) **Omega/The Bad Thing** - [5:10 in Omega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MQiuc06jIU#t=308) has the lyrics ""transcending boundaries of affliction"", which, although dissimilar in melody or harmony at that point, is evocative of the [similar wording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sNIbcqxYL0#t=85) in The Bad Thing about transcending earthly boundaries. Once again, showing progression of the character through the albums. -credit to /u/amongstravens

15.) **Omega/MK Ultra** - The surprising 'elevator music' section of MK Ultra contains a couple of cool progressions and licks, one of which [occurs at 2:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGROCglsafE#t=145). This exact snippet of material also can be found in [Omega at 4:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MQiuc06jIU#t=257) with a more expected guitar/drumming texture. -credit to /u/randyoung

16.) **The Bad Thing/Barney** - I haven't edited this in a bit and no one's probably looking at it any more, so I'll just add this one for personal amusement. The Mraky riff in the bridge to The Bad Thing [lines up with this video of Barney Dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmDH5Z9MXGQ), which clearly is not coincidental.

  FOUR LIGHTS/OMEGA 
     
I'm pretty sure near the end of Four Lights, at 1:40, It's the same as the Stranger Things riff at 1:30, but played in triplet form.

  THE BAD THING/ALPHA
     
Just lyrics, but the ""fly past the [withered] trees, ascend to holy air and breath"" from The Bad Thing / Alpha.

  22 FACES/THE BAD THING
     
The obvious one, the final line of the Bad Thing's chorus in 22 Faces, ""tearing a hole inside, I'm buried alive. Dweedle Dweedle.""

  OMEGA/A BLACK MINUTE
     
Omega reprises A Black Minute as well, and possibly Reprise too, at 9:20, ""embrace the feeling of a soul within,"" akin to A Black Minute's ""Embrace the feeling of our human skin"" at 1:00.

  STRANGER THINGS/ PSYCHOSPHERE

Stranger Things at 3:43, ""majestic Aura"" as ""sadistic horror"" moment in Psychosphere at 2:23.

"Official Discussion Thread for Periphery's Juggernaut (full album stream included)","The music box at the end of Stranger Things is the same as the music box at the end of A Black Minute.

More interesting though - A Black Minute opens with that same music box played in reverse. I don't have any software that could use to check this out, but it sounds like the first twenty seconds or so could be the last twenty seconds of Stranger Things played in reverse. 

Which would be interesting considering some of the lyrics in Omega:

    I'm lost within my own soul 
    A ghost within times of old 
    The clock turns back but is this real?

And later in Stranger Things:

    Fallen angel, you speak my name 
    The needle turns, the hourglass is spinning around 
    Give it, I want it 
    A sense of fucking life

They're awfully similar though."
"Official Discussion Thread for Periphery's Juggernaut (full album stream included)","OMEGA/THE BAD THING

At 5:13 in Omega, the line ""transcending boundaries of affliction"", which is similar to ""transcend these earthly/their fucking boundaries"" in The Bad Thing.

Zac Tiessen pointed this one out:

A BLACK MINUTE/GRAVELESS "" . . . 3:22-4:16 from this song is echoed in ""Graveless"" from 2:46-3:04 . . .""

I forget which songs have it, but I know it's in Strangers Things, Four Lights and A Black Minute: the music box noise at the end.

This has been one of my absolute favorite bands for going on 6 years now, staying in rotation for me even as my tastes have really shifted away from prog and metal. So I was weary heading into this album. But then they started releasing the singles. I enjoyed them all, but the last two they released, Graveless and Alpha, really stuck with me in particular. I was really struck by Periphery's growth in songwriting. I got my hands on the whole album a couple of days ago and have been listening to it on repeat pretty much nonstop. I can happily and safely say it's hands down the best Periphery release to date. From front to back this album is a perfect mix of the beautiful colorful leads, groovy without ever being derivative rhythm guitars, virtuosic drumming from Matt, and Spencer's ever improving vocals. 
Some of Spencer's vocal melodies and lyrics struck me as a bit over the top or cheesy on Clear, but here, in the context of this very emotive and well crafted story, every line feels like it has purpose. 
I'm on mobile and am getting tired of ranting but I really have so much to say about this album. Incredible release.

"How to go about approaching a Periphery or Animals as Leaders Drum Cover?","I've gotten myself familiar enough with the double pedal and I want to go outside my comfort zone.  AAL and Periphery are definitely bands that I want to start covering except their drums are so complicated and excessive to memorise...can anyone tell me how they approach learning these songs?"
"How to go about approaching a Periphery or Animals as Leaders Drum Cover?","Slap on your v-neck.

(I'm sorry.)"
"How to go about approaching a Periphery or Animals as Leaders Drum Cover?","I absolutely love this comment lol."
"How to go about approaching a Periphery or Animals as Leaders Drum Cover?","I'd start working on limb independence, helps with those complicated kick/snare/power hand parts with hi-hat chicking. Study the parts that are giving you trouble, listen to the songs over and over to get the patterns in your head, practice over and over, play to clicks, all that good stuff."
"How to go about approaching a Periphery or Animals as Leaders Drum Cover?","Break the songs into chunks. Maybe 8 bar phrases. Learn it slow, speed it up once you have it 100%. Then start connecting the phrases like legos.

Since im a guitarist, i dont know which songs are easier. Maybe a drummer on here can tell you their easier songs for drums. Or the drum subreddit?

Good luck, prog music can be extremely challenging but rewarding! 
"
"How to go about approaching a Periphery or Animals as Leaders Drum Cover?","Drummer here. Periphery and AAL are pretty advanced shit. OP, You say you've just gotten familiar with double kick? How long have you been drumming? Cause there's a lot more to these songs than the double kick. 

But to answer the question, I'd work out the share/kick patterns first. Work on keeping a steady pulse over that pattern, or just get familiar with it somehow. Then just piece the rest over top. Like add in the accented hits first, or add everything and work on the accents after. Whatever works for you. Do this for however many chunks of the song you need. 

There's a great video out there of Matt Halpern describing the 'pulse' and how he plays around with it.  On my phone so can't really search for it, but it shouldn't be hard to find. "
"How to go about approaching a Periphery or Animals as Leaders Drum Cover?","Ive been playing for 8 years. Normally when i approach songs it's not as hard so I've tried to challenge myself and am finding it a lot more difficult than usual."
"How to go about approaching a Periphery or Animals as Leaders Drum Cover?","Ragnarok is a pretty easy song from Periphery if you wanna start there. 

This guy has a good cover of it (although it is not quite iddentical to the song).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pjOMNl91xg"
"How to go about approaching a Periphery or Animals as Leaders Drum Cover?","like maximumrocker said, break it into chunks. watch live performances as well. Drumcams, workshop events, shit like that. Even drum covers that other people have done can help you

gotta soak it all up and hope your legs dont explode"
"How to go about approaching a Periphery or Animals as Leaders Drum Cover?","Get some software for phone or ipad that slows down the tracks you're trying to learn.  Create marker points for each section and loop them.  Work on each looping section individually at a very slow speed until you can play the beat then increase the tempo gradually by 3-5bpm only increasing when you have played the part correctly. 

Once you're done this agonizing task you can try to play the entire piece slowly without loops, slowly increasing the tempo in the same manner.  If you have the ability you can also use the slow down software to help you write out the drum parts on sheet music to make it easier to learn each of the beats."
"How to go about approaching a Periphery or Animals as Leaders Drum Cover?","I just sit down with the song, play the first 10 seconds over about 5-6 times, then try it out until I think I have it, then play it with the first 10 seconds.

Then I repeat this process for each 10 second chunk of the song.

It does take a long time to do but like anything in life the more you practice it the better you get at it."
"How to go about approaching a Periphery or Animals as Leaders Drum Cover?","When I'm trying to learn Periphery or Monuments I sit down with VLC and Guitar Pro and tab out the song (there are guitar pro drum tabs out there for older/popular songs, but they generally aren't formatted very well). You can slow the songs down in VLC to figure out the exact parts. 

After that, I just practice each riff or section seperately until I have them memorized and can comfortably play them over and over. Then it's just learning the transitions and being able to nail them. All in all, most of the time the songs aren't too difficult to learn, just time consuming. I'd say prepare to spend 2-4 weeks of practicing every day depending on your ability. "

"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","I am typically a technical deathmetal fan with a little blues rock sprinkled here and there.

But for years and years I have always loved a couple of bands that were outside of my typical range and I never explored the genre further until now.

I have adored Coheed and Cambria and Protest the hero for years. Recently I started looking for more bands like them and have found the following which I really enjoy:

* Corelia

* Periphery

* The Mars Volta

* Antemasque

* Closure in Moscow

Can anyone suggest more bands based on these that I might like? I typically like high pitched singing mixed with growls if thats any help.

"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","Listen to Black Crown Initiate. Their album ""The Wreckage of Stars"" has a blend of prog/tech death/post metal and they have great clean vocals that contrast nicely with the barking/growling vocals. Their EP ""Song of the Crippled Bull"" is also really good. For starters though, maybe start off with the songs ""Great Mistake"" and ""Purge"" from their full length. I'm on mobile so can't link.

Besides that everyone seems to be giving pretty good suggestions."

"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","You have quite a span in there. Prog metal/rock is a big field to play in. You should try **Tesseract** and **Skyharbor** (same guy singing in both bands). If you want to try something a little different, check out **Karnivool** (I recommend them to everybody...). Maybe you should check out **Between The Buried And Me**. While not entirely my thing, they are really loved by this subreddit and they make very complex songs. I just can't stand their kind of harsh singing. Should be no big thing for you coming from tech death."

"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","[The Safety Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy1mbDmaXXE) - One of the most unique prog metal bands, can´t think of any band that sounds like them, both their albums are amazing but the latest one is more consistent in terms of sound and flow. This song is a collaboration with the singer of 

[Between the Buried and Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi_TafYAcd8), prog metal legends that you HAVE to check out. Their 2007 album Colors is widely regarded as a masterpiece, where the band started to distance themselves even further from their metalcore roots and songstructures to create this album that can also be regarded as one big song as all the songs flow into each other seemlessly. Another big favorite of mine is

[The Contortionist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48oRWWhNezo) - Their debut album ""Exoplanet"" is mostly a straight up deathcore release with lots of progressive parts sprinkled in between, a favorite of fans who prefer their heavier side. On their follow up record ""Intrinsic"" they focus much more on dense atmosphere with jazzy chorld progressions, but still with many heavy and groovy parts (my favorite album by them). Their last record Language was also well received and is a continuation of them finding their own sound, this time even less heavier."

"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","Okay so I made this list of 74 recommended albums recently to give to a friend, it's rather extensive and you will definitely find something you like. Everything is labelled by genre and even has a suggested song link embedded. 

It's also not all progressive metal so there's some oddball choices in there but they're still great albums.

"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","I think if me and /u/Rollosh made a compilation list the world might implode. 

Macross 82-99 is great. FutureFunk itself is a great genre to kick back and jam too. Check out Groovy Godzilla as well, he's on that list."

"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","In a surprising move for this sub, nobody has yet mentioned Haken. Not a lot of growls at all, but the high-pitched vocals are really good, and they tend to be a favorite around here."

"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","I can't believe no one's mentioned Dream Theater yet, or maybe it's just understood. Metropolis pt2: Scenes from a Memory is probably their best album, and Octavarium is incredible (the song, not the album)"
"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","I think if you're on this sub, there's a pretty high chance that you've been exposed to DT even if it's not your cup of tea. I won't say they ""invented"" the subgenre but they've influenced it tremendously and were definitely pioneers. They're kind of a staple. Love DT. "
"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","Please check out our Hall of Fame (clickable from the top left of the page). "
"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","Since they both have former Periphery vocalist Chris Barretto, you'll probably like Monuments and Ever Forthright.  Musically, they have a ton in common with bands like Periphery, Tesseract, and Animals as Leaders.

Since you mention you like a mixture of high-pitched singing and growls, you'll probably like a lot of what melodic death metal has to offer.  Check out some Mercenary, Scar Symmetry, or Into Eternity for some that fit your description.

I can't link to YouTube at work, but here are some song recommendations from the bands mentioned.

* Monuments - Atlas
* Ever Forthright - Screen Scenarios
* Tesseract - Nocturne
* Animals as Leaders - CAFO
* Mercenary - World Hate Center
* Scar Symmetry - Ghost Prototype I: Measurement of Thought
* Into Eternity - Timeless Winter"

"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","Based on the bands you've listed Between the Buried and Me, Skyharbour and Tesseract would probably be worth a shot. If you're into tech death I'm sure you've probably already hear Focus by Cynic but if not all their other albums are great too. If you don't mind instrumental I'd also try Animals as Leaders, Cloudkicker and Scale the Summit"
"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","So this is not progressive metal or progressive rock. In fact this doesn't even come close to answering what you asked, but you said you like high pitched vocals mixed with growls. I'd like to suggest a fun band that is more thrash.  So put on your denim vest, crack open an ice cold beer, and enjoy 3 Inches of Blood:

"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","I'm a bit surprised no one has said this yet, but Dream Theater. Probably one of the most sell known prog metal bands out there. They not known for any growls, but high voice is one of their most well known qualities. "

"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","Check out Erra, they have a nice mix of high vocals and growls.

You should also look into Job For a Cowboy's newest album if you haven't already, it's fucking incredible.

Definitely check out Between the Buried and Me. I would start by listening to Colors and Parallax II.

Animals as Leaders is an amazing instrumental band, absolutely worth your attention.

Monuments is a great band who have released two awesome albums, and they have a good mix of harsh and clean vocals.

Chances are good that you've heard Fallujah already, but if not, their most recent album is my favorite album of last year.

Beyond Creation is great technical death metal/progressive metal if you haven't heard of them.

The Dillinger Escape Plan is awesome mathcore, with a good mix of clean vocals and harsh. One Of Us is the Killer is a pretty awesome album.

Yeah, this seems like a good starting list. Hope you like some of these!"
"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","Thank You Scientist, TesseracT, the Contortionist (check out their newest album, it's the tits), Protest the Hero. You've probably heard of these and I'm site others will mention them. "
"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","Tool, Porcupine tree, Karnivool, Jolly, a lot like birds, sianvar, hail the sun, circa survive (have some proggy things), pain of salvation, a perfect circle, glass cloud, "
"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","If you like Corelia please go support the recording of their new album. It's gonna be epic. "
"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","How has no one mentioned Meshuggah? They're one of the biggest influences on prog metal along with Dream Theater, though their sounds are completely different. Meshuggah is definitely more prog/tech-death, their earlier albums like ""Contradictions Collapse"" and ""Destroy Erase Improve"" are pretty thrashy with odd rhythms, and they eventually developed the whole ""djent"" sound with their albums ""Nothing"" ""I"" and ""Catch Thirtythree"" which used downtuned 8 string guitars, medium, groovy tempos, atonal/chromatic melodies and chord structures, and heavy use of polymeter (guitars and bass pedals playing in various oddball time signatures while snare/cymbal sticks generally with 4/4). Personally my favorite is Catch 33 as it is one long 45 minute piece of music but Destroy Erase Improve, Nothing, and Obzen are great albums that showcase their old/mid-career/newer styles."
"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","If you like Tech-death you will like [Rings of Saturn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6oSVDU_Tvg)

"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","A lot of people say that Protest the Hero is the band most similar to Dillinger Escape Plan in terms of vocals and song structure. I am a huge DEP fan and when someone recommended PTH to me I was instantly hooked. I would recommend starting out with ""Widower"", ""Black Bubblegum"", and ""Milk Lizard"". If you're looking for harder stuff they have that too!"

These bands sound literally nothing alike."
"Can any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?","Vocals and song structure= transitions from hard screaming to melodic singing, raging guitar and drums to piano. They may not be the same in terms of instrumentation, but otherwise I disagree. "

"IQ - The Road of Bones","I liked Subterrania a lot.  It's not as heavy, maybe just more of a prog album.  First IQ I ever got was their first album, Tales From The Lush Attic, which is purely prog, but if you like early Genesis, I think you'd love it.  "

I can see how the vocals could get grating, but I'm a big fan of Geddy Lee so personally I really like them. If you're still on the fence, I'd give [Ride of the Chechen](http://raijumusic.bandcamp.com/track/the-ride-of-the-chechen-2) and [Our Fate Motive](http://raijumusic.bandcamp.com/track/our-fate-motive) a listen, they're 2 parts of one song with loads of interludes and sections, as well as more vocal diversity than the OP."

"King Crimson announce UK and EU dates","Not to mention it's King fuckin' Crimson! They ought to be required reading for this place."
"King Crimson announce UK and EU dates","Haha that was my immediate reaction. I just listened to In The Court of the Crimson King again on Sunday night in an attempt to show my bf the origins of prog metal and ease him into some of the heavier stuff I'm into and it just blew my mind all over again. Like it does every single time I spin that record. 

I also facepalmed hard when his first reaction was, ""oh yeah! Kanye West totally sampled this!"" 

King Crimson's music is timeless!"
"King Crimson announce UK and EU dates","Speaking of Kanye, I first heard KC when they were sampled in Power, that led me to look into their back catalogue, and now here I am a regular in /r/progmetal."
"King Crimson announce UK and EU dates","That's completely awesome! :D Out of curiosity is that how you got into prog metal in general? What did you mainly listen to before discovering the sub genre? "
"King Crimson announce UK and EU dates","I'll try and remember. I've been into metal since 2007/2008ish, and I think by the time Power came out I had already heard Leviathan by Mastodon, or some other prog metal band. I found out that my favourite part of Power was sampled from KC, so I looked them up, found out they were progressive (which at the time I mostly knew as the stuff my guitar teacher always told me about, but at that point I had never listened to much). I then looked up their songs on youtube, thought it was great, so I decided to look up more of these progressive bands. Since I was already into metal, I decided to listen to the names I'd heard of, like Opeth, BTBAM, Barren Earth etc. Eventually I stopped listening to regular metal bands and just started listening to Prog mostly. Probably not as interesting as you would have hoped, I might have made it sound like I was a hip hop fan that converted to Prog Metal haha. I did buy My Dark Beautiful Twisted Fantasy when it came out, but that was an unusual purchase for me at the time."
"King Crimson announce UK and EU dates","Haha no I love hearing about how people end up down the progressive metal rabbit hole. Always interesting! I was mostly asking because, as I said, I've been trying to get my bf into the sub genre, even just into harder rock and grunge like APC, AIC etc over the past few months and was interested to see how predisposed to liking the genre you were.

Apparently pretty predisposed haha. 

Also, sounds like you had yourself a pretty cool guitar teacher! "
"King Crimson announce UK and EU dates","What's Adrian up to these days?"
"King Crimson announce UK and EU dates","Unfortunately not taking part in this. Instead the very mediocre Jakko Jakszyk is on vocals for this tour."
"King Crimson announce UK and EU dates","KC without Belew is a cover band.

/Aw snap! Bring on the downvotes..."
"King Crimson announce UK and EU dates","Not going to downvote, but what about their great cataloge in 1969-1975?"
"King Crimson announce UK and EU dates","The John Wetton-fronted KC is outstanding. The first album is pretty darn good, and was probably pretty bewildering when it came out. Personally, I always feel like the public opinion on it (especially on Reddit) is a bit overblown, at least in comparison to '72 onwards. The Belew-fronted stuff is my hands-down favorite band (maybe Zeppelin comes close for me). All the '72 and onwards groups are electrifying. For me, the '70-72 period is weak and never gets played at my house. Jakko is a fine musician, but to replace Belew with him is sacrilege to me, and I skipped the tour, which I have never done since '95. 21st Century Schizoid Band was boring as hell and now KC  has become that. Never thought Fripp would get nostalgic.

Of course, that's just my opinion, man. 

"
"King Crimson announce UK and EU dates","I guess it's mostly just because every era of Crim is different.  I guess everyone has parts they don't like.  I personally don't think that the 80s was that good beyond Discipline, but you probably like Three Of A Perfect Pair and Beat.  I love Larks Tounges, Starless, and Red.  Everyone has a different idea of the best Crimson.

Anyways, even bad Crimson is better than most bands in their good era's."

Songs like Dream House, the title track, and the latter half of The Pecan Tree. Their music just gives this overwhelming emotion that I haven't been able to experience in other songs before. Their songs give me goosebumps on every listen.

Then again, I completely understand why anyone wouldn't like them."
"Deafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)","I think Sunbather is an incredible album but sometimes I wish I could have an instrumental version of it to show my friends just because the vocals have such a high bar of entry."
"Deafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)","Seeing them live really cemented it for me.

To each their own, though. "
"Deafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)","I can see that happening, maybe it's just something that doesn't really carry through recording. Never going to happen in this dump I have to call home, though."
"Deafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)","I saw them live and the whole time I just stood there wondering ""Do these guys actually know how to play their instruments or are  they just all attempting to play as fast as possible?"" It sounded like a group of people all trying to play a different song on top of each other. I don't see the appeal.

"Deafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)","What's the matter? Can't handle a pink album cover?"
"Deafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)","I'll be the middle(wo)man here. Ever since it's release I've thought this album is really, fantastically ok. It's the epitome of alright. It's not memorable, but it's not bad. It's some black metal and it's some post rock, both of which, to me at least, sound like what I've come to expect from those respective genres, and I can take it or leave the final product that is Sunbather. 

What it is is severely overhyped, and *that's* what irks me. I don't get it. "
"Deafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)","Yeah, I really never understood the critical adoration - and I'm a fan of the album. It kind of seemed like most people writing about it just really wanted to use MBV words like *swirling*, etc, and just be viewed as diverse. 

I think Cult of Luna's *Eternal Kingdom* and *Vertikal* are both superior albums and neither got the kind of love that *Sunbather* did."
"Deafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)","Oh Cult of Luna are massive. When it comes to mixing in post elements into metal CoL definitely take the cake for me. Their melodies and pacing and layering speak to me more, but I also just enjoy a doomier more brooding and sludgy sound in general so that could be part of the why haha. "
"Deafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)","I'm really only learning how far CoL's influence spreads well after the fact. 

I live in Nashville, TN, and from the moment I picked up *Somewhere Along The Highway* until today, I can probably count the number of people who know who they are on both hands - and I introduced them to half that number. I've consistently been one of only two to order their output from my local music store. Which is a bummer."
"Deafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)","When they play this song live it is absolutely insane. So many emotions in the last half of the song, easily some of my favorite lyrics and just moments in music."
"Deafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)","This band really does split the metal community as a whole. A lot of people, like myself, enjoy the record for what it is, while others might loathe it for a variety of reasons. 

What I don't understand is why so many people are quick to call it garbage. Yes Pitchfork did get a whole bunch of hipsters on the hype train for this album, but the fact that an album like this is so universally hated for that reason is ludicrous. "
"Deafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)","I almost want to blame George Clarke for that. He works his ass off on stage, sure, but he's the only black metal / post equivalent to David Lee Roth Rockstar emotes I've ever seen."
"Deafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)","His stage presence was hilarious. It was like watching a depressed Michael Jackson front a black metal band. And I don't know if he writes the lyrics but they can be pretty bad at times"
"[Discussion] Periphery canceling their appearance in Philly tonight. The rest of the show goes on as planned.","From their facebook page:

&gt; To our dear friends in Philadelphia,
&gt; We are extremely upset to inform you that we are not able to make it to your fine city to perform for you today.
&gt; There are two members of Periphery who are currently battling illnesses/ailments that sadly require full on bed rest. Doctors have been seen and they have strongly advised us to take the immediate, necessary time off from performing, to stop the symptoms from getting much worse on both accounts.
&gt; We are working with our team and the promoters to find a new time/date to come and perform for you all, but today we will absolutely miss you.
&gt; On a positive note, Nothing More, Wovenwar, and Thank You Scientist are doing just fine, and will still be coming to Philadelphia today to absolutely destroy for you.
&gt; We will continue to update you as information comes in, and we genuinely thank you for your understanding and empathy in this shot situation.
&gt; Please still enjoy the show today, and we'll do our best to get back to you as soon as we can.
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; Periphery

Tampa saw a truncated performance from these guys a few weeks ago, with Spencer stating he had strep throat. A song was played instrumentally, for that purpose.


I am curious as to the plan to remedy this for those who paid to see Periphery. I was only interested in TYS and Periphery when I went. TYS played for about 20 minutes, followed by the shit sandwich that is that radio metal that filled the time between TYS and Periphery. I would not be happy about going to a show like this and would expect a full refund.

Edit: This actually may be the last day of their tour. Seems so shady, despite them being sick. I feel so bad for anyone who wanted to see them and now are stuck w/o the money for their tickets and no show worth seeing.

Edit 2: Looks like full refunds being offered at ""point of sale"". So, I guess you either see the venue or whatever ticket broker you used.

"[Discussion] Periphery canceling their appearance in Philly tonight. The rest of the show goes on as planned.","I completely agree here. Like I said, when they came to Tampa, they played a short show. I doubt they did this for NYC. Instead of giving that time to TYS, they just let us all leave early. Thanks guys.

More on topic of this song, I do like the addition the acoustic guitar, varies the texture in a nice way, that's one of my few occasional quibbles with his music, there's a bit of sameness to the texture throughout. A consistently excellent sameness, but a sameness nonetheless.

Although the progression around three and a half minutes is so crunchy, love it, really reminds me of CHON with all the extra color tones.

"Strange sound in Dream Theater's Rite of Passage","Hey guys,

I was just listening to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJqAO6cwvfw, and I noticed that there's a strange high-pitched tone at 4:52.

Anybody noticed this before? I've listened to this song dozens of time and never picked up on it! I think it's Petrucci's guitar, he probably hit a fret, but I wonder why they didn't do another take (he would have noticed it)? Any theories?"
"Strange sound in Dream Theater's Rite of Passage","I don't hear any high pitch guitar noise at 4:52, do you mean the one at 4:47? Because that's a standard pinch harmonic used a lot in metal.

EDIT: Ok I think I heard what you're talking about, it's very faint, I had to jack up the volume to really hear it, It sounds a lot like metal striking metal. I guess they thought it brought character to the mix, I don't know, it's not really that noticeable."

It makes me extra-proud to have delivered the master of what I consider the most daring, technical, fresh and mature album we’ve done.

"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","I think it has to do with chart placement more than anything, because that helps a band in multitudes of ways.

Wow, I said this about a few songs, but seriously: at parts, Heavy Heart's vocals sounds EXACTLY like something from Coheed and Cambria (namely In keeping secrets). I like it, but it will take getting used to in a few parts.

"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","I got the double t-shirt preorder pack. Clicked. Did not regret."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Currently on my second listen through. This album honestly blew me away, and I'm even more excited to figure out the story. There's something about the darkness and depth to the songs that makes the concept even more engrossing to me. Yay for graphic novels"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Hmmm. As some one who is not a fan of Peripherys past releases, this has actually surprised me a little bit. I'm still not a fan of Spencers vocals (a statement hang worthy around here, I'm sure) as I find them quite over bearing and over the top, but the instrumental work in this has me more intrigued than anything they've released before. I can't say Iove every song here, but there are shining moments that may have me coming back... "
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","As much as I love Spencer as a vocalist, I have to agree with you. He can be so over the top sometimes. Like His Work on P1 was sick because it was mostly his screams mixed with his great cleans and it was super interesting. On these past few releases though, I feel like Spencer has taken over the band a bit. Their songs no longer have that raw, guitar fueled sound of their first album, Spencer has shifted their sound to a much more poppy upbeat feel. Every song he sings, his vocals go so over the top that sometimes they just get distracting to me. It seems like Misha has simplified his guitar playing a lot to allow Spencer to be the focal point, And I feel like they lost a lot of technicality and sacrificed it for Spencer's catchy-ness.

I still love this band, and will continue to buy everything they put out and enjoy it, I'm just sad that Spencer's vocals have become so predictable. When you go so over the top for everything, it all just becomes bland."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","[deleted]"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","This is spot on what my friend and I have both been thinking but couldn't formulate into words.. I hope Bulb does more solo work again."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","My two biggest complaints about periphery, and what has always kept me from really being a fan, are: 1) The tones are occasional so far down the digital rabbit hole that they sound extremely brittle and 2) Spencer's vocals just sound juvenile and out of place in the world of metal.

But I've always LOVED the instrumental portions of Periphery's music, from a compositional foundation anyway. I think Misha is capable of brilliance.

Two things I'm noticing about this record: 1) The tones are much more beefed out and professional sounding. This doesn't sound like your typical ""my band is really influenced by Periphery and we recorded this djent song in my bedroom!"" which ironically Periphery has always kind of sounded like. I guess they've been guilty of caricaturing their own style I guess. Over-reliance on digital processing to make up for a poor acoustic recording environment can do this kind of thing to a record. But on THIS recording I feel the weight of the guitars a LOT better. 2) Spencer's over-the-top melodrama is toned down a lot. Still not really a fan, but it's not nearly as over-bearing as it's been in the past and it sounds like his balls are finally starting to drop so there's that...

If they continue in this direction I might be a fan."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","That might have something to do with the fact that it wasn't recorded in a bedroom and they actually rented out a studio space this time around."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","It shows."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","And they actually used cabinets :O"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","All the tones are still made with their AxeFx units, but I agree that the sounds are very good. Nolly's mixing and production on this album is top notch. "
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Yeah there a definitely a handful of awesome parts that I love, but there are also a few songs that seem totally bland to me. I felt the same way about PII at first, but then it grew on me, so hopefully that will be the case with this one.

I'm with you on Spencer's vocals. He's incredibly talented and writes some great vocal lines, but there's a nasally aspect of his voice that I can't stand. It's okay for the most part, but on some of the trickier vocal parts it really stands out. On the other hand, his growls have gotten sooooo good.

Definitely going to have to give this 10+ listens before I can form an complete opinion though."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","wow, this is going to be the best album of 2015 and 2015 just started. So much awesome."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","You forget that BTBAM is releasing an album this year. "
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","And Intronaut. "
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","And Tool! Right guys? Please? Can we have it this time?"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","You bet! Pre-Order the new Tool album and get a copy of Half-Life 3!"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","While were at it, lets assume Necrophagist will release something."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Isn't Tesseract also working on a new album?"

"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","That's a pretty bold statement."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","So what you're basically saying is you can see approximately 1 year into the future? Can you give me next week's lottery numbers please?"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Honestly pretty underwhelmed by the whole thing. I'm definitely going to give it many, many more listens, but it isn't blowing me away right now."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","this is only alpha, we are still missing omega."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Yeah... Periphery I &amp; II were instant favourites for me. Here I'm liking a few parts; a few songs but I'm not amazed yet. It'll be on repeat for a while indeed.

Edit! Eh, 3rd / 4th listen it's really starting to grow on me. I'm really enjoying the atmospheric / ambient feel on the record in a bunch of the tracks. Heavy Heart, Rainbow Gravity + Hell Below, Omega, Stranger Things are my top tracks thus far. "
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","[deleted]"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","I am with you. I listened through it once(both a&amp;o) and started again and noticed towards the end of the second time through I wasn't really paying attention anymore. I'll keep trying though. It's not bad...just not really what does it for me. "
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Same here. There are definitely a few gems, I'm really enjoying Priestess, Hell Blow, and Heavy Heart. I don't think Alpha really stands out by itself, whereas Omega is definitely interesting. I do think it's probably a bit of a grower."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Where are you guys getting Omega?"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Google, can't post links here."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Fair enough, I can just wait for my pre-order haha"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Oh good, I'm not crazy. They sound great, but everyone raves about their music and I always need to force myself to turn on one of their albums to see if maybe this time it will finally click. I wondered if it was because I'm not a musician myself so maybe something just pass by my notice that are really amazing if you know what they are actually playing, but every time I turn on Periphery my mind wonders, it just doesn't engage me. "
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","you haven't even listen to the whole album"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Really? I actually have."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Not Omega. So no."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","I downloaded the leak last night, so once again I have listened to both albums."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Psychosphere is the jimmy jam jawn smash. "
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","These guys hit a home run that rebounded back and they hit it again.

Seriously this is awesome"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Am I the only one who thinks heavy heart is really really boring?"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","I thought heavy heart was one of the best tracks on the album.
"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","It's different. Not that there's anything wrong with it, that is. It's fantastic, but it's just one that's growing on me a bit slow. After listening to both albums though, Omega takes the cake as the better half. Much heavier and meaty, especially the last 3 songs. Congrats though guys!"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Well, let's just say that I'm very happy about putting in a pre-order for this album."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","I really really enjoyed Alpha, but Omega absolutely blew me away. It's so heavy and dark and i'm glad it lived up to the hype in my opinion."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","I thought this was fucking fantastic."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","I'm really digging the Coheed influence in the sound."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","This album really goes well with Diablo 3. Just throwing that out there."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Was getting into you guys with PII. But, I just spun both these. Holy hell. These albums are groovy as fuck. "
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Excitement is an understatement.

"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","I would delete this so you dont get banned"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Yeah, I just read the sidebar. Oopsies."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","My opinion definitely echoes that of those who are put off by Sotelos vocals. I've been listening to periphery since before P1 so I'm not just hating, I'm legitimately disappointed. From a professional musical career standpoint for the band, adding vocals made sense. You can appeal to a wider audience and be a ""complete"" group to be accessible to more mainstream labels/tours. But with that addition they sacrificed what got them here; rhythmically deep and creative songwriting that take time to ebb and develop throughout a single track (most notably on tracks like Racecar). They have glimmers of this in P2 and Jugg, but nothing like in P1 and before. The vocals detract from anything interesting that's happening instrumentally and breaks the immersion of the listener. "
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Loving it so far, Nolly you are my hero I can't wait to see you guys again. "
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Are they gonna release Omega too? "

"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","[deleted]"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Is it just me or does the bass really overpower everything else in the mix?"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Where did it go?"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Ah, The instrumentation is cool as is the atmosphere and melody but does anyone else here think the singers voice is winey and annoying?

It just reminds me of too many emo/screamo/core/whatever bands singers from the 2000's and ruins it for me.

I wonder how his growl is. I feel like a lot of singers over do it and ""over sing"" because they feel like they are the spotlight/center of attention.

Sorry Misha. You're a cool dude and I've been listening to your music since you had a ""bulb"" MySpace."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","I have always disliked the Vocals in this band, the cleans at least. To me, they are very whiney and just obnoxious. Really takes me out of the music anytime they come in. Really like the instruments, but I can't stand the dude when he sings."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Yeah this. Instrumentals would be awesome."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","With ya there, it bothers me at times because there's really interesting instrumentation happening but his vocals are distracting"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Love that album by the way^"
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","I'l listen to the whole thing later, but I'm finding it kind of hard to get past the vocals which, to me, seem very cheesy and remind me much of bands like fall out boy or something. I like the complexity and varied nature of it, especially the jazz fusion-ey mix after the first part but the heart and soul of the band just seems a but...lacking.

Edit: couldn't do it."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","Bring at least 15 changes of pants. You will jizz them."
"PERIPHERY - Juggernaut Album Stream","First listen, Alpha not that much memorable, Omega jsut started but then again, PI was the same thing, then listened to ""New Groove"" and heard the band with new ears.

So far, Sylosis' is a much stronger album, let me finish this and wait to see if BTBAM will destroy my mind again.

EDIT: Hell Below is something, huh?

EDIT2: Meh. I had so much hype... back to Sylosis.

EDIT3: All the songs are good. Best album of January"

It's a very poorly designed venue in my opinion...there's only one exit for everyone to file out of so it's just one giant, slow moving cluster fuck. If there was a fire or something it would get really dangerous very quickly."

"Dream Theater - In The Presence Of Enemies","Probably one of DT's most underrated songs."
"Dream Theater - In The Presence Of Enemies","why is everything ""underrated"" on this sub?"
"Dream Theater - In The Presence Of Enemies","TBH, this song is rarely discussed/mentioned in this sub or elsewhere. The word may be overused, but this definitely fits the bill."
"Dream Theater - In The Presence Of Enemies","The ""Slaughter of the Damned"" section (6:03-9:17) is absolutely one of the band's highlights. "
"Dream Theater - In The Presence Of Enemies","Their best song by far. Atmosphere, build-ups, solos, everything."
"Dream Theater - In The Presence Of Enemies","Love this song.

And Systematic Chaos as a whole, for that matter. Talking about underrated, that's a DT album that has that title for me."

Periphery was so fucking tight though, the crowd was going crazy. Mark and Misha both I believe let a couple people finger their guitars ;). Nolly got his fan out at the end and cooled off the audience. Oh and spencer grabbed this kids gopro and ran around the stage with it. "

Modern Day Babylon is another solid one. Anathema isn't metal, but their new stuff is all clean vocals and they're amazing. Animals as Leaders, too, even though someone already mentioned them. I just have to reiterate how amazing they are. If you like Protest the Hero, I would recommend Destrage, but they do have a pretty good mix between screaming and clean vocals. Other than that, I think that's a pretty decent list."

"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","Skyharbor's first album is mostly singing with some screaming, but their second album has no screaming whatsoever.  It's less metal instrumentally as well, and goes more into hard rock territory.  Not a bad thing, but I wouldn't necessarily classify it as ""metal"" (personal opinion). TesseracT is same singer as skyharbor before he left the band for skyharbor.  They are more heavy on the screaming, but ""April"" specifically by them is a brilliant song."

More symphonic than progressive, but they're one of my favorite bands so +1 for Epica"
"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","I'll add [**Plini**](https://plini.bandcamp.com/album/other-things) and [**Wanzwa**](http://music.wanzwa.com/album/wanzwa-iii) to your list of vocal-less albums.

Both of them are super cool; Wanzwa is weird, psychedelic, trippy prog rock that just doesn't give a fuck about limits or boundaries or what's acceptable. It's too weird for some, but I've loved every album. Plus the dude who does it, [**Marty Eason**](https://soundcloud.com/marty-eason) is a beast and does other things too.

Plini is wayyyyy more chill. Mostly focused on guitar, he shreds up something bad, but totally has his songwriting DOWN. He's a great dude too always [doing things for charity](https://plini.bandcamp.com/track/ko-ki) and what not. Real down to earth type. His trilogy of albums will be complete in March and I recommend grabbing a [pre-order](http://plini.bigcartel.com/).


Lastly, I'll mention [**In Via**](https://frames.bandcamp.com/album/in-via). They are a bit more prog-*rocky* but the way they write will give you visions if you close your eyes and listen. I was high, but only on the tunes. "
"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","Oh wow, I've never seen anyone mention Wanzwa here! That first album is *out there,* it's fantastic. A ton of weird, awesome songs.  
  
Also, Plini- Absolutely phenomenal, SUCH good song writing! With that said, everyone also needs to hear his original project, [Halcyon](https://halcyonofficial.bandcamp.com/). This is some of my most favorite music that has come out in the past five years alongside CHON and a few others. So sick."
"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","Yes. I remember listening to Halcyon back when!

Because of the name they're really difficult to search for, but combinations of ""3 band"" on YouTube should find their stuff.

"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","[The Safety Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0bv6zvUSPc) are perfect for you. They have a very unique style of songwriting with influences from Meshuggah, Periphery, Protest The Hero, Dillinger Escape Plan, Sikth, with a beautiful haunting voice, with occasional yelling or shouting.

Protest The Hero, Dillinger, Sikth are also highly recommended.

"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","I strongly suggest you to *try* and like harsh vocals. I was in your position a while ago so I know how it feels to love a band's instrumental but be unable to listen to it because of the vocals.

Fortunately I found some bands that I just could NOT not listen to and after a while I ended up enjoying the vocals. Now I bloody love harsh vocals, not all of it, of course, but things like [Adrian's lows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJhq7k5K5Zo) are just so damn good.
[Within The Ruins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-F_r9z5ZiM) and [Eluveitie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iijKLHCQw5o), as I like to say, Stockholm Syndrome'd me into liking harsh vocals and I'm thankful to them for that.

So as a opinion from someone that was were you are, try to like it. Listen to BTBAM more, find another band you love the instrumentals and keep listening to it, you might eventually like the demon voices :P

===========

But aaaaanyway, on-topic, give [Wings Denied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZYbFY9XkZU) a try, they're pretty damn good and the vocalist shows up in the sub sometimes, really nice guy [and he's an amazing vocalist too].

Have you tried much power metal? Some of that stuff has a similar vibe to prog with lots of good Bruce Dickinson style singing: Blind Guardian, Sabaton, Iced Earth, Stratovarius. "
"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","Prog Metal similar to BTBAM, without vocals:

- Modern Day Babylon
- Wide Eyes
- Walking Across Jupiter
- (some of) Animals as Leaders

The best Prog without vocals:

- [All those above, especially AaL]
- CHON (like AaL but very upbeat and happy tone to it, chill)
- Plini (ambient, incredibly chill, like Cloudkicker and Tycho had a baby)
- Sithu Aye (very similar to Plini, slightly more heavy)
- Cloudkicker (varies quite a bit, can be heavy, can be very chill and minimalistic)
- Polyphia (flashy, party djent)

The best Prog Metal/Rock with clean vocals:

- Twelve Foot Ninja (everything; reggae, funk, rock, metal, dubstep bits, awesome vocals mostly clean, one of a kind, just awesome)
- The Contortionist (specifically Language- xtra proggy, beautiful, mostly clean vocals)
- TesseracT (one of a kind, been mentioned, Altered State is magnificent)
- Uneven Structure (some harsh vocals, atmospheric, great cleans)
- Tool (hovers between Rock and Metal, Prog nonetheless, all clean)
- Dead Letter Circus (similar to Karnivool, more like Prog Alt Rock)
- DispersE (been mentioned, brilliant, fantasy-style)
- Rishloo (similar to Tool, very underrated)
- Lesser Key (up and coming, with Paul D'Amour who was in Tool, Rock-ish, a little like Deftones)
- Persefone (quite a bit of harsh vocals, very technical, pretty unique, great few tracks that are instrumental)
- Shokran (mostly harsh vocals but instrumental version of their latest album is available and incredible, technical oriental)
- The Safety Fire (been mentioned, I'd describe as Prog Indie Metal)
- Northlane (bit of a stretch, mostly harsh vocals, but check out Quantum Flux, great lyricism and technical drumwork)"

"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","Vanden Plas has some magnificent work I think often flies under the radar far too much. Let's see, I'm not sure where to tell you to begin though.

Their earlier albums, The God Thing and Beyond Daylight, are great. Both of which have a more melodic and less metal sound.

Skip Far Off Grace.

Then there's the latest three: Christ 0, The Seraphic Clockwork, and Chronicles of the Immortals: Netherworld Path 1. All three are story-driven concept albums. And all three are amazing. Christ 0 has a great blend of melodic and metal. Seraphic is probably the heaviest. And Chronicles turns it down a notch to create an amazing atmosphere and ambiance.

If you're on the fence about sinking your teeth into a full album, here's a VP starter kit that I think has some decent variety:

- Porcupine Tree (later albums - earlier stuff is more on the rock spectrum, but still great)  
- Tool  
- Areyon (and other things involving Arjen Anthony Lucassen)

"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","TesseracTs album Altered State"
"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","Obviously depends on how heavy you want it while also being clean, but scrolling through I haven't seen anyone mention these yet:

**Gazpacho** - akin to *Anathema*, perhaps, but less epic in scale, not very heavy.

**Quidam** - they're not active any more, but check them out, fairly lightweight as well.

**Redemption** - this one is more metal than the other two, *Snowfall on Judgement Day* is one of my favourite progmetal albums.

**Riverside** - they've been mentioned, but deserved reiteration, great emotional prog, possibly more rock than metal but still fairly raw and heavy at times.

**Synaesthesia** - Almost psychedelic at times.

**Kingcrow** - More in the same vein as *Anathema*

**Nevermore** - wanders between prog metal and power metal, worth checking out.

Also check out stuff where *Devin Townsend* is involved, potentially *Neal Morse* as well if you like the more synth based melodies, although you seem like the more guitar-heavy type. My taste might be too light for you altogether, but sharing anyway.

Oh and some of the heavy stuff I listen to - **Ne Obliviscaris** could be worth a listen, they do have quite a lot of growling sometimes but there's also clean vocals and longer expanses of instrumental. Another one is **The Ocean**, they have both instrumental and vocal versions of most of their music."

"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","Leprous is cool.  If you like Townsend and Haken you should like them.  "
"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","I'd like to reiterate how incredibly good Karnivool's ""Sound Awake"" is.  Also, Asymmetry is their third major label release and contains minimal screaming (as in, two sections in just a couple of songs) and is an interesting concept album.  Start with Sound Awake though if you check them out.  

I wouldn't say The Contortionist is without growling vocals, but the song ""Language I"" off their most recent album, Language, is brilliant and contains clean singing.  I would look up that song specifically.  

Opeth has been mentioned before, but their catalog is huge and may be hard to sort through for someone not familiar with them.  Damnation was a very quiet and introspective album they did which is dark, but not traditional metal.  It's non-metal from a metal band.  Watershed was their last effort that could be classified as anything near traditional metal.  It does contain some growling, but it's mixed in with a lot of clean singing and non-metal instrumental sections that make it worth checking out.  Heritage was a complete departure for them, and is more in line with 70s acid prog like King Crimson.  Those three specifically from Opeth are all great albums and drastically different offerings."

"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","I see Babylon and Atoma mentioned here so need to throw in another Middle Eastern reference. How about Israel's finest, Orphaned Land?

Also, how about Deadsoul Tribe? Very low-key under-recognized band with some metal influence and a little Jethro Tull flute sprinkled in to get your prog juices flowing."
"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","I know a lot of people have mentioned them, but I''ll reiterate. You need to check out Cynic if you haven't already. They've been doing this since '93 and each of their albums feels completely unique. If you don't like one, you're bound to like another. They're one of the kings of the genre, in my opinion."
"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","How about Klone? French prog metal band. Throw in a saxophone every now and then. They get pretty heavy sometimes with some harsh vocals but never really reaches that ""death metal"" kind of harshness."
"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","I'm not sure how ""prog metal"" they are, but I love Polyphia's new album ""Muse.""

"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","I can't recommend Ayreon, or anything made by Arjen Anthony Lucassen, enough! Like you, I really enjoy progressive metal without growling vocals. Growling ruins the music for me, since what I most enjoy is the amazing melodies you can find in the progressive genre.

If I should recommend a specific album, I would pick [Ayreon - The Theory of Everything](http://youtu.be/TQFmfZCcrYw). This is an amazing concept album, which tells a continuing story about a genius who can't express himself. The story itself brought me to tears (I should say, I am easily moved by music, but this one is special), and the music never ceases to amaze me. It's sad I will probably never get to hear this album live, because of the many different artists involved, but it is really worth picking up and listen to."

"Can anyone recommend me some progmetal bands WITHOUT growling vocals?","I was in your position a year or two ago when my friend showed me Periphery. For a very long time P1 and P2 were the only prog albums I had, that is, until he showed me Tesseract (Altered State is magnificent, also definitely try April off of Tesseracts earlier album Concealing Fate. A bit harsh but the overall song is very clean). Later I discovered Intervals, Volumes and Sithu Aye. I don't think anybody has mentioned Sithu Aye yet, he's a one man spacey prog outfit who shreds incredibly hard and most of his material is available on his bandcamp for free sithuayemusic.bandcamp.com , my personal favorites are Invent the Universe and Pulse"

"The Dillinger Escape Plan - Understanding Decay","Love this album, but to call it prog?"
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - Understanding Decay","I'd defend the label. I think they have and showcase a ton of different influences in their music and the way they dilute and play with time signatures is mind bending. Is it mathcore? Yes. It is also progressive? Yes. "
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - Understanding Decay","Fair enough. I myself have often wondered what exactly is the difference, if there's any, between prog and so-called mathcore. The definition of the latter reads like something that applies word-for-word to prog."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - Understanding Decay","Most progressive metal I feel, is structured in a more classical way. Whereas Mathcore or Mathrock is a lot more ""all over the place"" and hectic. They are pretty similar though, definition wise. They share a lot of the same characteristics. "

"Good Guitar Effects Pedals for Prog?","Hey, first of all- I'm not sure if this question is allowed here. If it isn't, I'm sorry, and I'll delete it. The reason I ask here instead of /r/guitar is that I think I'm more likely to reach my 'target audience' here.

But I wanted to get this community's opinion on what are some good electric guitar pedals for prog metal playing (and additionally what amps/setups you use?). 

I'm looking for a suboctaver, a customizable delay, that sort of thing. Not against multipedals, but they tend to be (in my experience), quantity over quality.

Also, really interested in getting another wah. Best wah I ever had was a Zoom, nice gain, good range, etc.

Any suggestions?

Edit: Forgot to mention that I have a Jackson Pro Soloist (SL2)."
"Good Guitar Effects Pedals for Prog?","[Strymon Timeline](http://www.strymon.net/timeline/) is a great delay pedal. I don't have one, but I've used one.

edit: not sure what you mean by a ""suboctaver"" but the [EHx POG2](http://www.ehx.com/products/pog2) lets you add layers of -2, -1, +1, and +2 octaves for some amazing density. "
"Good Guitar Effects Pedals for Prog?","Hey, that's pretty much exactly what I meant by a suboctaver, thanks.

But man, that delay pedal looks pretty nice. The built-in looper is a nice touch, too."
"Good Guitar Effects Pedals for Prog?","You could get a Line 6 M9 for delay chorus, and misc..  

If you want standalones, there's the Line 6 Echo Park and the DL4.  Their Digital Delay is just my favorite delay sound. But there's tons of good stuff out there, and preference is a big part of it.

For reverb, for general use, the Hardwire RV-7 is awesome.  For octo/shimmer, the Strymon Bluesky is the best.  And it has a saveable preset so you can toggle a shimmer verb and a more regular verb.  If you need to save cash, the Line 6 Octo is the 2nd best, and their regular verbs are really good too.  That would be the Verbzilla pedal (no presets though).

Chorus/Vibe I really love my BBE Mind Bender.  But the new EQD Sea Machine (V2) looks sweet too.  It's not out yet I don't think.

Wah and volume I will always go Morley.  Pots are for suckers.

"
"Good Guitar Effects Pedals for Prog?","Thanks for the great list! I'm gonna have to do a lot of research, and see if I can source a few of these to try out. :)"
"Good Guitar Effects Pedals for Prog?","Get an MXR Carbon Copy. I had one and would just play with it for hours on end. It's perfect for clean delays and I honestly wouldn't recommend anything else. "

"Anyone know when Plini is releasing new album?","Hey! I am currently listening to what I think is the final master of the new EP, so won't be too long now :-) Sorting out options for physical stuff (wanting to do a special edition box-set for the EP trilogy and a shirt or two) at the moment as well, and as soon as that's all figured out I'll make a proper announcement, start getting stuff made and taking pre-orders!

As mentioned, Simon from The Helix Nebula is on bass, my dad also played some double bass on one of the tracks which was cool. Chris Letchford did a sick guest solo on the first track, and I had a young and insanely talented Polish buddy of mine do a solo on the last track (I'm sure most of you know who I'm talking about). Most exciting in the lineup for me is the drummer, in my opinion the best prog drummer around right now :-)

And yep - trying to sort out some local shows with the Helix Nebula at the moment, UK Techfest is happening in July and some other stuff beyond that is on the cards too. Really excited and I love you all for taking an interest and the encouragement!"

I much prefer the 'Gentle' version of the song. The 'Storm' version is honestly probably one of the least interesting things Arjen has written in 15 years or so.

"Queensryche - The Mission (Live Video)",""
"Queensryche - The Mission (Live Video)","Anyone know when this video was originally recorded?

I'd think late 80s to early 90s based on a few key clues:

* That hair man. That hair!
* It's like, a double guitar!
* Look at the clothing!

By the way, no one cares what the band members look like and who they are. That's obviously not objective facts that could suggest when it was recorded.

A young-looking Geoff Tate? Nope, don't care. It's all about the *style* man. Which brings me to another clue:

* The *style*, man."
"Queensryche - The Mission (Live Video)","This was on the ""Empire"" tour and I think this video was recorded in May 1991. They recorded three nights of the show and released it as Operation:Livecrime.

I saw this tour and didn't know much about the band.  They played all of Operation:Mindcrime and it was amazing."
"Queensryche - The Mission (Live Video)","You lucky duck! No knowledge of what you're getting into and you get to see Queensryche in their prime putting on the entirety of one of the greatest metal albums of all-time. It must have been something else.

If only I was into good music as a child, I could have gone as well!"
"Queensryche - The Mission (Live Video)","Operation: Mindcrime is one of my top 10 albums of all time, love it!"
"Queensryche - The Mission (Live Video)","I got drawn in by listening to ""The Mission"" on vinyl. About six songs later I didn't know where the time went.

Operation: Mindcrime is truly one of the masterpieces of my lifetime."
"Queensryche - The Mission (Live Video)","It's so sad how once the Lead Guitarist (spacing on his name) left and Tate took helm, the band fell dramatically. Now that Tate's out and La Torre is in, the band sounds a lot better.

I saw them live in Renton, WA for free, with La Torre. Man did they sound great, I even got a drum-stick from Scott Rockenfield that was tossed into the crowd."
"Queensryche - The Mission (Live Video)","Chris DeGarmo is who you're thinking of. When he left...Queensryche just changed. It's like a really subtle shift but I don't find any post-DeGarmo stuff interesting. And I especially think Tate's new album is bad. The LaTorre album is...meh. kinda okay. I just really miss DeGarmo"
"Queensryche - The Mission (Live Video)","Yeah the new stuff is decent. I meant the live performance of the older stuff is more proficient."
"Queensryche - The Mission (Live Video)","Chris DeGarmo? Once he left the band did go downhill dramatically, but I don't know that the quality declining was solely because Tate took the helm. He had a lot of credit and was involved with the material right from the start.

Actually, the band as a whole seemed to do a lot together as a group early on. I think the problems came after Tate seemed to dictate the musical direction the band was going to take with no input from the other guys. If you look at the newest album with La Torre, there's a lot more group involvement in the song writing department.

Anyway there's no way we can know for sure what happened after a certain point. All I'm looking forward to is another Queensryche album. And in spite of all I said about DeGarmo, if he was mentioned as involved in the album I might just poop my pants from excitement."

I love Periphery I, and I also love Periphery II and Juggernaut. It's laughable to  me that a fan base is actually so divided over this. If you prefer old Periphery then fine, that's your opinion that you're completely entitled to. But when people start doing this shit, arguing that ""new Periphery sucks"", and ""bulb should go back to writing all the material""... well it makes the whole fan base look like a bunch of elitist hipsters. "

This post did come across much more negative than I originally intended, but I stand by it.

I also already commented on the fact that in no way am I saying ""new Periphery sucks"", and I don't know where you're quoting me on that from anyway, so stop putting words in my mouth.

"With all this praise for the new Periphery, it seems a lot of people have forgot how much better they used to be...so here's Letter Experiment.","People are talking about periphery here a lot because they just released two records, not because they forgot their old stuff.

Better to just post the song. "

Something about that opening riff just reminds me of some old P1 tunes.

I still love Jetpacks, Buttersnips and Totla Mad, though. It's just kind of a dense album and not as varied as the later ones."
"With all this praise for the new Periphery, it seems a lot of people have forgot how much better they used to be...so here's Letter Experiment.","Haha, actually our opinions are almost complete opposites here. I can't listen to that beginning riff of Rainbow Gravity without craving Icarus Lives!"
"With all this praise for the new Periphery, it seems a lot of people have forgot how much better they used to be...so here's Letter Experiment.","Maybe Im just a bigger fan of Bulb than I am of Periphery. Their first album was like 90-99% Misha's work and it was beautiful. As soon as the other members began collaborating I began losing interest. They just became so tame. 

I still agree Juggernaut is an amazing album on its own, I just can't understand how everyone is able to jump on the ""Jugg is their magnum opus"" bandwagon. If you held up both albums and told me to pick which one was a better representation of the bands talent, there wouldn't even be any contest. If you tried telling me Juggernaut was a better album, my response would be ""You're confused.""

I know I'll get hate for it, but it's my opinion."
"With all this praise for the new Periphery, it seems a lot of people have forgot how much better they used to be...so here's Letter Experiment.","Haha, I mean it's all opinions. Some people just like the added elements that newer members brought, and some people can't get enough of Misha's writing. Neither one's right or wrong, and I doubt people suddenly dislike P1 just because they might prefer Juggernaut; it's just the newer shinier album and it's getting talked about. I'm sure general perception will change as Juggernaut exits the honeymoon phase or grows on people. 

But hopefully no one gets blasted for going against either circlejerk. I think it speaks well of the band that they've already got such a diverse discography that they've got people divided into camps based on only 5 years of existence as a group."
"With all this praise for the new Periphery, it seems a lot of people have forgot how much better they used to be...so here's Letter Experiment.","See, I do enjoy the styles of the other members as well, Clear was an awesome EP to be able to hear everyones styles. Nolly blew me away with Extraneous, Mark's Pale Aura was the shit. I love Matt's style and work too. 

People seem to be twisting and misinterpreting my words and assuming this is just me bashing Periphery's new stuff. Its not, thats not at all what Im getting at. Multiple times I've said that I still love them and their music, no matter what it is.

My opinion that people seem to be missing is that I was let down with the direction they took. Their first album was so good, and I was really hoping their second album would be along the same lines and in the same style, which is where I was very let down. I still appreciated P2 for what it was, but I couldn't, and still can't, keep from wondering what could have been if they hadn't gone down this new road.

Long story short: I love Periphery, I always will, I just hear the new stuff and can't help but wonder what they could have been."
"With all this praise for the new Periphery, it seems a lot of people have forgot how much better they used to be...so here's Letter Experiment.","Sorry, I didn't mean to imply you didn't like the different writing styles!

I just meant there are infinite facets to their music and limitless ways to perceive them, and all views are valid. I figure you know this, I just latched onto the Juggernaut bandwagon thing and wanted it out there in case anyone came in here wanting to downvote people who don't completely love the new stuff, haha. 

Btw Pale Aura is indeed the shit, I love Mark's style and picking out his parts!"
"With all this praise for the new Periphery, it seems a lot of people have forgot how much better they used to be...so here's Letter Experiment.","Don't be sorry! I totally agree with you, and in many ways I love what they've added to the band and what the band has become, I just sometimes wish Periphery could have done its thing (with Bulb as the mastermind) and had the new lineup be something different.

I don't know, maybe I just need Bulb to release more things, but I really enjoyed Bulb's style with Spencer's harsh vocals on P1. I guess I'm just having all sorts of mixed feelings about the album right now, lol."
"With all this praise for the new Periphery, it seems a lot of people have forgot how much better they used to be...so here's Letter Experiment.","I remember defending Spencer so hard when this album came out, and he got so much hate online. Then Periphery II came out, and I realized... goddamn, he was actually kinda mediocre on this album. His cleans sound so throaty and forced, and his harshes are pretty monotone.

"I made a Video if myself playing Rainbow Gravity by Periphery with a Tab if anyone wants to learn it!","Nice man.  I want bkp's in my next guitar, which is very possibly going to be a custom Jackson.  I have custom dacts in my [Ibby](https://imgur.com/a/RImI3) now."
"I made a Video if myself playing Rainbow Gravity by Periphery with a Tab if anyone wants to learn it!","Oh dude that's sick. I always thought the natural finish ibanezs were the coolest ones"
"I made a Video if myself playing Rainbow Gravity by Periphery with a Tab if anyone wants to learn it!","It took a long time to find a cheap 7 in a natural finish, and I was about to just buy a black one and do it myself.  Snagged this rg7321 on CL for $250 already finished/tone knob deleted/dacts in it.  Had it set up and now it plays like a frikkin dream.  

Still wanna find another 7321 in black to do myself, they go up quite often in the $200 range."

"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Got the twin albums in the mail today and I have to say I am so *blown away* with what they have created. It is really heavy without sounding like they are trying to be the blackest most brutal band out there and that's an achievement as far as I'm concerned. What I love is the way the music (especially the vocals) really manage to convey the intense emotions the character in the story is experiencing, very moving. The artwork is fantastic also. I need to hear it some more but the real stand outs are:

* The Bad Thing (SO POWERFUL, both emotionally and musically, I lose my mind every time I hear the transition from the end of the first chorus into the 2nd verse. *chills*)
* Alpha
* 22 Faces
* Heavy Heart

Being one who really digs concept albums in general, I have been reading the lyrics and listening to the songs and I have a rough (and brief) estimation of what I think is happening in the story, though I may be way off, it will be interesting to hear what they say when they eventually talk about it.

* **ALPHA**: So I think it starts during a satanic cult birthing ritual in an old cathedral in the forest (judging from the artwork) where the mother is bathed in the blood of the circle while the child is being born, and the onlookers pore their hatred and negativity into the child in order to create a demon. The child grows in the cathedral where it was born, in total isolation, the only people he comes into contact with are the cult, and as he grows, the hatred builds inside of him until it overwhelms him and the darkness takes over.

* **OMEGA**: At this point he becomes the embodiment of all the evil and filth that had been poured into him from inception, strikes out and slaughters everyone. There is a brief mention of a girl locked in the same place, growing up, who may have been his only companion, however briefly, and fears what they have turned him into (what is underneath the stone), and manages to escape and run away. He starts to realise his own demonic destiny, believing that what soul he may have had has been destroyed and this leads him on a Journey down into the earth (""there's a crack in the earth"") where he is being called by Beelzebub. Once he arrives he has an internal struggle, believing that he is sin, destruction and unholy filth, yet he yearns for forgiveness and begins to repent. This begins to heal his soul and he is drawn up into the light above, to his surprise.

I'm keen to hear what everyone else thinks.

Either way, killer albums. Fucking stoked."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I've been listening to this album on repeat for the past few days. It's honestly incredible, so well crafted. This is definitely their magnum opus. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","am I the only person so far who thinks it doesn't even come close to P2...?"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I thought that at first.


Then riffs got stuck in my head.

I actually saw them last night and was more excited for new stuff over PII stuff.
"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Different songs been stuck in my head for days now."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Last night was badass dude "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Was it just me or did they sound weak at first? Seems like their levels were off or something. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Now that you said that, yeah maybe a little bit. I was having a hard time making out the guitars. Everything beyond that was on point though. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Yeah it got heavy as fuck once Icarus Lives was over"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","&gt;then riffs got stuck in my head 

That's the thing, Juggernaut is much less of a prog album than P2.  Clear was a fun little detour, but by the time I reached Omega I was getting bored of the pop metal shtick. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I'm not sure if I agree with that. Juggernaut isn't really pop metal. Sure it's got some poppy tracks, but so did PII (Scarlet, Ragnarok). Juggernaut is definitely a grower. I didn't care for it after my first couple listens. Somewhere in the last few days it sort of clicked for me. Now I'm finding little parts of songs all over other songs and having a blast with it. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Periphery will never shake that 'pop metal' label and it's because of Spencer's vocal style really. And to be honest, if you're not a fan of that, then you haven't been since they released their first album. I like your subtle pun too. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","haha, glad someone picked up on that. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Out of all the other way more applicable for that description songs off P2, you go with Ragnarok? That was like, the furthest thing from ""poppy"" on that album."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Lol, yeah you might be right. The vocal part at the end just strikes me as poppy."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Eh, fair enough I suppose. Haha. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Give it time man. All Periphery grows on you."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I was actually disappointed the first time I heard the double album. Then, the second time around I found some of the riffs stuck in my head. The third time around, I found myself humming the tunes uncontrollably. Now, I really feel all the reviews that Juggernaut's got are justified. It very well maybe their best stuff, yet."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Very much my sentiments. I'm listening for these recurring riffs and themes, deciphering the story and trying to piece it all together.it's gets increasingly more fun. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","oh no, the youtube comments are full of people that argue over and over about how this stuff doesn't compare to P1 and P2 and so on and so forth. I can say unequivocally though that even though I really enjoyed both of those releases and their compositions, they literally don't hold a candle to this new material. Mainly because of how much their sound has shifted over the years. I find it hard to compare the previous albums even to each other let alone these two albums to anything that came before it. 
Different strokes for different folks though. :)"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I like them both quite a lot, though I like P2 more."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I'm not a huge fan of most of P2. It's a solid, well-crafted album, but it's just not for me.I just feel like Jugg is a mix of the best parts of their previous albums. 

Also,Spencer's harsh vocals sound really good, and his cleans aren't quite as irritating to me. 

"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I really love Juggernaut, but I also like P2 *way* more. There's no song that immediately grabs me here like Ragnarok or Scarlet. It's a good album, but P2 is still their standout work IMO."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Who knows, I'm glad there is no definitive periphery album and that the consensus is quite divided across all 3 records. I personally think p1 is untouchable but each album shows growth, development and delivery on different levels"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I've been like a vulture stalking it's prey, while waiting for these albums."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","....[you?](http://www.metalsucks.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/protestthehero-volitioncover.jpg)"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Hehe yeah. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Volition! "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I still cant get over how amazing the songs Omega and Stranger Things are. Omega feels straight out of a BTBAM Album, but with that Periphery catchiness we all know and love. And Stranger things is such a simple song at heart, but they do so much with it."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I really like one of Spencer's new vocal techniques where he just yells. He's not screaming, not growling, just straight up yelling his balls off. Listen to rainbow gravity for an example. My personal favorites right now are Rainbow Gravity, Psychosphere, Graveless, Omega, and Strange Things. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","My personal favorites are Rainbow Gravity, Omega, Priestess, The Hell Below, and The Stranger Things. This album as a whole might be my favorite of all time, but I'm unsure of that. However from Priestess through The Stranger Things, it's definitely the best ~30Minutes of consecutive music I've ever listened to."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","There's no ""THE"" in those song names. Its just ""Hell Below"" and ""Stranger Things"""
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Who cares?"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Just letting you know... Before you get the wrong names ingrained in your brain. 

Its like calling Periphery ""The Periphery"".

Just trying to help, didn't mean to come off as rude."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I love Misha and the Peripheries."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","[deleted]"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I love *The* Misha FTFY ; )"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Yeah my bad, my comment comes across as really snarky. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I'm pretty excited for this release.  Ya know, I used to be one of those ""Old Periphery"" fans that didn't welcome their shift from Periphery 1 to 2 and I was worried about Alpha/Omega.  I started when there was no Periphery 2.  I started off on Racecar, so when the Icarus EP first was released, I heard Frak and had that raging erection but then quickly lost it when I heard Eureka and Captain On.  Then P2 came out which I still liked (now love), but something was missing.  Clear came out to which I initially thought was abysmal, now I love it.   

But then I sat down and said, ""Yo I gotta stop being a fucking dickhead"" and embraced their style.  I realized they never changed, they progressed.    

I was just talking to my friend earlier today about The Bad Thing.  I love the lyrics.  The first verse ""Sometimes there a crack in the world that I can peer through"" and the second verse ""Sometimes there's a hole in the earth that I can step through"" both blow me away.  That concept sounds so fucking cool to me.  "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Totally man. You get so caught up in wanting a band to sound like they did when you first fell in love with them but if they did you'd get bored because they would be stale. Periphery are always moving on and I love them for it. I must admit I struggled a bit when Opeth brought out heritage, but I'm all in with pale communion, so I understand where you're coming from."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I will admit though.. I really wish Periphery played Racecar on the regular.  I'm very lucky to have caught them on their Frak the Gods tour.  That was the only tour they played it and the way it's looking, the last tour they'll play it.  Hell, I'm lucky to have caught them with both Bois and Murphy in the band.  

They've come a long way and I'm very proud of them.  
  "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Racecar is a great song, but due to it's length, they could in the same space play 3 other songs that are also fan favourites, so I can see why they don't."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Let's just say your not really an old fan if you hopped on at Racecar. Lol."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Well actually it was Oxmodius and some of bulb's demos that got me started on them.  Actually, I didn't even know bulb was a part of Periphery back then because I just listened to songs off youtube's side tab.  Jumping from song to song.  But when I listened to their debut album, I listened to songs like Jetpacks, Light and Icarus to start.  And I was like, uhh, this sucks..  

One time I was listening to Itunes on shuffle playing Dead Space and Racecar randomized, and I was like Oh shit wtf is this??!!?  That's when I guess I considered myself a fan.  Which I guess still isn't that old of a fan.  But I tell you what, when I first seen em as opening acts there weren't many people there for them.      "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Juggernaut may seriously be a contender for my all time favorite album. That's a really good take on the concept too, I've been trying to interpret the lyrics and your explanation makes a lot of sense."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","It was a very basic interpretation, I feel like there's some nasty shit that happens during Alpha that I didn't go into detail with but it all contributes to the increasing insanity of the character. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Just saw them last night in Arizona. 

Ah-mazing!! By far one of the best shows I've been to. I really am impressed by Juggernaut so far, especially seeing it really is the first album that the entire band has contributed to, rather than remakes of Bulb's old songs. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","They fucking killed it last night "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Since you have the lyrics would you mind posting them? Or maybe take a picture or something? Mine hasn't even shipped yet "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I second this!"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","These albums...they're incredible"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","The albums definitely did not disappoint and I really like that Periphery explores music rather than cementing into one style. The only thing I dislike is some of the clean vocal lines. Spencer has phenomenal vocals, without question, and some of his best work is present on Juggenaut, yet there are times where it sounds completely out of place. It's jarring to hear one weird note when he sings one word, followed by a perfect phrase. Rainbow Gravity is an example after the beautiful guitar solo.  

""Can we find a place where we can finally think for ourselves?"" Really good. 

""We can fly. We can soar."" The note he sings soar sounds so bad to me. 

""Staring in the face of what we chose to accept, but can't ignore."" Amazing. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Yeah, I feel the same way. 95% of the time, I enjoy his vocals, but there will be a few moments, where I kind of cringe almost. But, as a whole this album is one of my favorites all time."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I know what you mean, 95% of the vocals are like FUCK YEAH! And there's just a couple of cringe moments. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","[deleted]"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","[deleted]"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I would love this album so much more if I didn't feel as though Spencer threw up all over it. We get it dude, you can sing. You don't have to treat every song like its a fucking vocal solo."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","He needed a producer for this instead of doing it all himself."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","They said it was going to be a more vocal focused effort as a whole, and he's in a band literally comprised of producers. I'm pretty sure they're happy with what he did with it."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","This. To put it as someone did above, I feel like 95% of the time I'm cringing and 5% of the time I'm like FUCK YEAH! 


Is Periphery just not for me? :( I tried to give this release a fair shot, I really did. I've listened to it 3 times through now. But Spencers nasally all-epic-all-the-time-gasp-when-I-end-phrases vocal style really hinders my enjoyment of, what I think is, well put together instrumental work. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Spencers vocals on the first album will forever be his best, before he got a big head and decided he had to go over the top with absolutely everything. I still love this band, and this is a great album, I just wish Spencer would re-evaluate his role in the band and realize it's not all about him.
"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I don't see it that way personally. I agree that his work is best on p1 however I feel that given Spencer's versatility and room for growth they decided as a band to push the narrative through him. And of course he's one of his own biggest proponents, but the final album really proves that he's almost as much responsible for peripherys success as Misha "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","We can fly. We can soar is actually pretty creative and cool to me. I'm suprised to see how opinions differ. Its actually interesting. "
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I'd say that one line is probably currently my favourite one on the record! It's delivered in such a unique way and gives me chills."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","[deleted]"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I'd say you pretty much hit the nail on the head with the story line, although I'd say there's probably more to fill in for the Alpha section. Also the way I interpreted it on my listen through of Omega, I'd say he kills himself to rid himself of the pain, and then he is forgiven and ascends to holy air where he can finally breathe (possibly heaven?).

But yeah, your description is really good! have my upvote!"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I agree with the suicide part.  All the lyrics in Graveless point to that conclusion, plus Hell Below is right after, so that'd be a perfect flow in the storyline."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","My interpretation is similar, but not exactly the same: I believe that the female character in Alpha is one of the ""mothers bleed hung upside down"", perhaps a satanic/cultist ritual where children are the goal: perhaps to turn them into demons, perhaps not. ""22 Faces"" is a clear reference to a book called Twenty-Two Faces, which actually tells about children who have been subjected to ritualistic abuse and because of that, they've formed new personalities and traumas. MK Ultra also seems to be speaking about children who are ""forced into mind control"" or corruption or so. I have to dig into this. I have to connect all the pieces."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Either way, mind control that is forced through ritualistic abuse seems to be one of the most central parts of the story. I believe that, in fact, this mind control might be satanistic possession, in Graveless it is mentioned that one of the characters (which is more focused upon in Omega) that he or she has felt Beelzebub all along within him. Perhaps the character has realized that he is horrid, and has done horrid things, and apparently commits suicide. Thus he or she falls in hell, but eventually - deserves another chance at life. ""Demonic children"" and ritualistic abuse on both mother and children seem very Rosemary's Baby-esque themes, and Spencer had just finished watching it when he started to wrap up the concept."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Fucking. Shit. *"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","YOU CAN'T SAY THOSE WORDS ON THE INTERNET!"

"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I'm sorry guys.. I've made a huge mistake. I hereby renounce my membership of the No Cuss Club. What I have done is unforgivable. The only thing left to do is commit ritual suicide to preserve what tiny shred of dignity I have left."

"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I really hate screaming and growling or whatever its called in music, but it actually works pretty well with this band. I feel like its balanced with the clean vocals, so the screaming doesn't overstay its welcome. Might be a good transition band for me."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Try listening to Hessian Peel by Opeth. Also a good balance there. I used to hate screaming/growling when I was young, it just took me being exposed to it for a while before it **clicked** and I loved it. It may happen for you too."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","That's exactly what happened for me too.  Periphery II was my transition album from hating screaming to loving it.  I just thought of it as an instrument and suddenly a switch was flipped."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I've listened to the album a few times through and I couldn't really piece the whole story together but from what I heard I didn't really get that story from the lyrics. "

"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","I got my double CD yesterday and waited listening until I laid in my bed in the evening. Just two hours ago I listened again, while riding bike. I actually took a bike tour just to listen to the albums :D

And I love both. I think Juggernaut is the best thing Periphery ever did. It has everything I love in music. Dynamic songwriting with contrast in both the vocals and the instrumentation, amazing singing with great harsh vocals, a really engaging groove, some mathcore-esque riffs, some chillout parts in between, some catchy choruses(heavy heart, for fucks sake!!!), complex lyrics... I could go on and on about this record.

I'd say this would be hard to top this year, but with releases from Slice The Cake, Xibalba, The Crinn, Ion Dissonance, Amia Venera Landscape, maybe Meshuggah, maybe Converge, maybe Dionaea, maybe Rivers of Nihil and more coming.... you know my point"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","It might just be my interpretation, but doesn't the last line of the album (The skeletal mask brings forth the demon of the day) seem to imply that his repentance and acceptance into heaven was all a delusion?"
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","That's a good point I never thought of it that way. It would be fitting for the crimes (?) he committed."
"So Juggernaut is f***ing my s*** right up","Once again I find myself late to the party but hey whatever. 

Dude nice summary! I always thought the cultists let him go to do the demons bidding in the real world. So he became a killing machine. I figured by Reprise he has started murdering children in his demon-controlled state.

Your explanation of Priestess (or the girl rather) really was awesome because that's the only song I couldn't figure out. 

Anyway I'd say we're at least 75% in sync."

If you enjoyed it, I encourage you to do more. It's impressive hearing ethereal compositions like that being interpreted as prog.

I kept trying to catch a glimpse of your gear and software, too. Care to give any insight on them? I haven't recorded anything in a few years and I'm impressed by how rigs keep getting smaller while sound keeps getting better. And you've got a really clear and balanced sound."

"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","Literally blew up one of my earphones listening to this yesterday.

It was lovely."
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","I was doing the headbanging frown face the whole song."

"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","Confirmed for brown note "
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","Racist "
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","This has got to be the heaviest song Periphery's put out"
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","Depends on what you mean by heavy. It's not very brutal or technical. Just super low tuned to me. Imo, Four Lights is heavy as fuck. "
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","Four Lights is one of the heaviest moments on the entire album. That and the end of Psychosphere."
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","That riffage on Four Light is magnificent!"
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","""It's not very brutal or technical"" I think that's the point, at least for me. I consider ""heavy"" and ""brutal"" as different categories of extreme metal. For me Meshuggah is the heaviest band but certainly not the most brutal (would probably be some tech death or grindcore? dunno, not something I really listen to)"
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","Most brutal... Dethklok. "
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","Heavy does not = brutal or technical."
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","Imo it does. Low tuning does not equal heavy. To me, this song lacks vigor to make it their heaviest song put out. I see why people might feel that this is heavy and that is their opinion. It is heavy, it's just not THAT heavy. I just feel the tuning makes it SEEM like it's their heaviest. To each their own."
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","I don't think low tuning makes something heavy either (though it doesn't hurt). Heaviness is a certain quality stemming from a real hard hitting groove for me. Technicality, while nice at times, certainly doesn't make something heavy IMO. In fact I think too much technicality can ruin a good heavy groove. But too each their own indeed. I love these discussions because everyone feels heaviness as something different."
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","For me it's a tossup between this and MK Ultra with Four Lights as a close third. MK Ultra is just so fucking raw. "
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","I agree, Mr person has always been probably bulbs heaviest song. Mk ultra has also very similar mixing ,it has that punch and raw feel like the original. Rainbow gravity is definitely amongst similar ranks "
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","This song gave me a hell below. "
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","The music perfectly fits what's going on in the lyrics (If I'm correct, the character in the story is on his descent to Hell).

The jazz interlude at the end made it for me though.  It reminds me of elevator music, which also fits in the whole descending feel."
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","youtube link got DMCA'd. still seems to be on grooveshark for anybody who has no moral quams stealing music (I don't)"
"Hell Below - Periphery (Juggernaut: Omega)","Parts of this remind me of the second half of Massamune, which until now I believed to be their heaviest moment."

"Guthrie Govan - Erotic Cakes (2006) - [3:50]","I feel like he would have said 'not meant to sound good' as a way of highlighting it's dissonance rather than meaning it's not supposed to be enjoyable. Guthrie has a rather self deprecating sense of humour so I wouldn't put it past him!

"Amplifier - ""White Horses At Sea // Utopian Daydream"" (FFO Steven Wilson/Porcupine Tree)","Their self-titled album is probably their next best. If you find you liked what you heard there and maybe want something a little more fuzzy and raw, check out Insider. Echo Street is a softer album as a whole and has a lot of songs like this one, but the pacing's a bit uneven. Mystoria I haven't listened to a ton, but it seems to be a more mainstream effort from them, in some ways similar to Insider-era stuff."

[Periphery, - Omega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwNQlNd0vyA&amp;list=PLVWT5waYZYnnGk0f6fuQffLUekGazg5ez&amp;index=6): Cannot recommend these guys enough. Their First, Second, and Third (Recent, Double album / Concept record) are all FANTASTIC and unique. Some people dislike Spencer as a singer for various reasons, dunno how you'd feel about it. Regardless, 6 fantastic talented dudes. Heavy, Catchy, Melodic all around. 

[The Contortionist, - Primal Directive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvPnewykSU4): A song off their first record. It's about the human race leaving for another planet. It's Heavy, Groovy as all damn fuck, with amazing tasteful ambient/instrumental sections. Their second and third records are also great too, though for the third record they changed direction a little in their sound in a way I'm not a fan of. All 3 are worth a listen though.

[Ne Obliviscaris, - Painters Of The Tempest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTiX-xAgBi8): A little Melodeath metal. Their first record is great. Love it to death, the melodies that can happen between Singing and Violin and their guitarists blow me away. Their second record is even better which is what I've linked here. 

[TesseracT, - Concealing Fate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBXVDyR7YC4): Their first record is heavier overall since the vocalist does harsh stuff, while the second is a little less so. But both groove like hell.

"I've exhausted my resources and need some help.","The Ocean. I think they're probably (to the bands you mentioned) closest to BTBAM. I think The Ocean are way better though. Check out their newest album called Pelagial. It's a concept record about the ocean itself. The deeper into the record you get the darker, heavier, and denser it gets. It's in my top 10 favorite concept records of all time

Plus it's humorous- a band called The Ocean releases an album *about* the ocean titled a fancy ass way of saying *the ocean*. Cracks me up. The only one beter is Black Sabbath's song Black Sabbath on the album Black Sabbath.

"I've exhausted my resources and need some help.","Alright, I may be a bit biased. But if you like BTBAM you should like Black Crown Initiate. Here's [their EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhY8-iJnZ-M), they do have a full length, but their EP is just... perfection.  
  
If you like Protest the Hero you will like [Sikth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTy_FKOAI4w). They are basically an earlier version of Protest the Hero.  
  
I have to go with Intervals if you like Animals as Leaders. Here's their instrumental EP [In Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyBrxxUWO28). Their full length is very good IMO but everyone points to this EP as their definitive work.  
Their drummer, Anup Sastry, also releases solo material constantly, which you can find for free on bandcamp. I'm very partial to the [Titan EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WvRGUiRGoo) and the [Lion EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vZW4jlKuSY). He released a full length as well called [Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1OBJm3dcdQ) which is really good but I like the EPs more.  
He records the drums live and also records guitars live. But to note, he doesn't play guitar, he records one note at a time and arranges them in the software. Crazy as hell but very talented.

"Danny Carey of TOOL and Brent Hinds of MASTODON collaborated and released two songs under the name The Legend of the Seagullmen","litigation? is there a lawsuit going on?"
"Danny Carey of TOOL and Brent Hinds of MASTODON collaborated and released two songs under the name The Legend of the Seagullmen","There is. Although they've kept most of the details out of the public eye. Essentially what is happening is this:

After the contract fiasco with Zoo regarding the number of albums and merchandise rights (circa 1998-2000; we can thank these lawsuits for the delayed Lateralus and the release of Salival as a means to settle what they were obligated to do), Tool took out an insurance policy to try to prevent and protect themselves in the future. With the suit that the 10,000 Days designer and manager brought against the band - demanding to be paid as an equal with the other four - the *Insurance company* they hired to shield them from something like this **is also suing them**.

I'll have to find the source, but Adam Jones admitted that this has not only delayed this ""future album"" we've heard about for years, but that it also may prevent them from ever being able to record and release as Tool at all.

It's an incredibly convoluted clusterfuck, and really sad that the main roadblock to them returning are greedy, capitalist opportunists.

Edit: Someone linked Adam speaking about it briefly above."

"Danny Carey of TOOL and Brent Hinds of MASTODON collaborated and released two songs under the name The Legend of the Seagullmen","They got sued over someone claiming they were owed credit for the 10,000 Days album artwork. According to Adam Jones they've been stuck in the resulting legal battle for years and that's why they haven't been able to get any work done on the new album.

"City in the Sea - The Ocean [Off one of their heavier albums, Aeolian]","Sounds like an awesome time, I saw them live before and they were one of the best live performances from a band I've ever seen. Too bad they were only opening, their songs are so long and epic they only managed to fit 3 or 4 in the time they had."
"City in the Sea - The Ocean [Off one of their heavier albums, Aeolian]","Yea man it was wild. Each band on summer slaughter only had a measly 25 minutes set. So, night before, Robin and the band are telling us that Robin has been having technical issues on his equipment on this tour but they've figured it out. Sure enough, they only play 2 songs because of said issues. That part sucked but I can't complain since I got to hang out and party with one of my favorite bands for two days non stop. They made up for it when they headlined and played pelagial in its entirety on the next tour."
"City in the Sea - The Ocean [Off one of their heavier albums, Aeolian]","Doood I'm jealous you got to experience that. Gonna definitely be looking out for their shows. Idk if they've ever headlined a tour in Canada but to see them rock a proper setlist would be epic.."

Now if they would just drop the new album that they promised us like, a year and a half ago I would be happy."
"Veil Of Maya - Conquer","I don't understand how you can hate [id] or The Common Man's Collapse, both were produced by Michael Keene and you can really hear it. And yeah, Misha's influence on Eclipse hasn't really done a lot of good for me, though I love his work.

This song is my favourite on the album though, and it works so well without having a trippy breakdown on it. A lot of tracks and riffs I missed when first listening to it as a younger, more naive metalhead, I've only just started to notice and really appreciate recently."
"Veil Of Maya - Conquer","Soon... soon..."
"Veil Of Maya - Conquer","My theory as to why people like CMC so much is that it sounds a lot like Born Of Osiris' *The New Reign*. I think there's a lot of fan overlap between the two bands."

"Veil Of Maya - Conquer","You think? I remember learning it a while ago and thinking it was one of the easier songs from them I learned."
"Veil Of Maya - Conquer","Yeah, it's definitely not their most complex song, but it's above my skill level."
"Veil Of Maya - Conquer","For real, I thought all of their songs were beyond me. But I just buckled down and learned songs like It's Not Safe To Swim Today, Mark the Lines, It's Torn Away, Entry Level Exit Wounds, Mowgli, Namaste, Wounds, and Pillars. You can do it, I have faith!

"What is the most overrated or underrated band?",""
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","I was going to mention a few newer albums by established groups that I think are being viewed too kindly based on previous albums, but then I remembered a few younger groups that have recently been sending people into insane frenzies. I nominate: The Contortionist, Ne Obliviscaris, Periphery and (God help me) Corelia. 

Do not get me wrong, they've all (except for Corelia) shown dramatic and mature progressions in their sound. I even think they've all (except Corelia) released some forward-thinking albums that could prove influential down the road. 

That itself is probably *me* overrating them, but god damn if some people can't handle anything less than perfect praise of some of these groups. Also, I know some of these comments were made in jest or mockery, but do we need to proclaim everything ""album of the century"" 3 hours after it leaks?

They're great bands, but there is no way they can live up to the hype that's been surrounding them. Let's just all calm down and accept that they're not perfect and won't satisfy everyone. Not even Corelia. Yet. ^I ^take ^back ^what ^I ^said ^about ^them ^^Nostalgia ^^is ^^the ^^best ^^30 ^^minutes ^^of ^^life ^^ever ^^^please ^^^hurry ^^^on ^^^the ^^^new ^^^albums

"
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","I know what you mean when it comes to The Contortionist and Periphery. Good albums but not masterpieces. But the new Ne Obliviscaris was IMO the best album of 2014. Just saying. Also super hyped for Corelia! There is no way the new Corelia isn't in the top 3 albums of the year."
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","If I didn't have a couple of darling favorite artists release last year I'd be right there with you, and in terms of extreme progressive metal that isn't djent or deathcore I do think they're leading the pack right now. 

And I don't think it's unreasonable at all to call something album of the year right away, especially since Citadel was released towards the end of 2014. I did legitimately see quite a few ""album of the decade/new millennium"" comments when it started streaming though. After spending a few months with it I still think it's definitely something special and a potential classic, I just cringe when I see labels like that applied before people have a chance to let stuff sink in.

I'm both hopeful and apprehensive about Corelia. I know they had some drastic lineup changes that could affect the writing, and I'm honestly kind of worried about the double album thing. I think Ne Ob did it right by keeping Citadel at a reasonable length, because it's very rare for an album to go over 60-70 minutes without me getting fatigued by it. We'll see though!"

Boy, are you going to hate the next Potmos Hetoimos album. "
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","You know, I've always kind of wanted to see someone attempt a legit triple album. Not a compilation, not a live album, not a soundtrack, like a band (or person in this case) just writing and recording a ridiculous amount of music. How in the hell do you pace something like that?

Thank you for mentioning him/them, by the way! I just listened through Recurrence and then a few tracks off of The Greater Gospel and I like the diversity I'm hearing. I'm definitely going to check out the rest of their stuff and The Paragon Trisagion when it's released!"
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","You could check out Kenn Nardi's Dancing With The Past. It's basically 20 years worth of material on 157 minutes. Absolutely massive, both in size but also in quality."
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","First thing I thought of was Periphery. They are extremely good, but Alpha/Omega is.... Just great? Its like a game made by Nintendo. Its supposed to be good, and it is, but nothing you haven't seen/expected before.

I had no idea Contortionist was a band that got significant love, though. 

I hope Corelia's new album is worth all of this hype, because I will die if its a let down."
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","Gotta say I don't understand all the hype with periphery. It's weird, I WANT to like them because I love the idea of a slickly produced meshuggah-sounding band but less heavy and with some clean vocals, but in actuality I can't stand Spencer's voice, and their albums sound extraordinarily overproduced to my ear at least. The drums at times sound more like EDM drums, to the point where it's like, why are they even trying to use acoustic drums and go through this whole process of compression instead of just using synthesized samples. And I like the guitar tones but even on monitors it's all muddied up by way-too-present bass kick. Don't get me wrong at times the writing excites me but in the end it's overshadowed by the emo vocals and EDM production.

On the flip side I can't say I agree about The Contortionist, I mean, I wasn't crazy about the vocalist on their first two records and the writing was a bit haphazard but they showed promise. I really do think with their new vocalist and Jamie King producing Language that they took a gargantuan leap forward and I'm excited to see what else they come up with. ""Masterpiece"" is definitely an overused statement just in general but IMHO they deserve some real credit. Also back to periphery, I know I was kinda shitting on them but it is really cool they finally put out a concept record, so just because I don't personally care for it doesn't mean they don't deserve props. I mean, lots of people definitely love their shit so clearly it has ""struck a chord""....heh"
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","Everything you mentioned is why I can't listen to Periphery too. "
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","I was absolutely ecstatic when I heard Mike Lessard would be joining them full time, and I agree that it's their best yet. It did take some time to grow on me, but I still think that a few songs meander a bit at points and could have been trimmed, even though the album's only ~45 minutes as is. 

When it hits, though, it hits. Thrive is possibly one of my favorite songs ever. Like you said about their previous albums, I think they're still a bit haphazard in their songwriting (Arise feels too quirky and off-kilter to me besides the B-section, and I tend to blank out near the end of Integration and the middle of Ebb &amp; Flow), but they're definitely realizing their potential more and more, and I think they'll top Language with the next album.

As for Periphery, I think you're spot on and those are all very valid criticisms. I just happen to love them for all of the reasons you described, haha! As much I like them, though, I think people do overrate them by treating them like they're above critique and objectively amazing. Thankfully, judging from your positive comment score the downvote brigades have calmed down."
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","That's so funny! It's ironic because I feel like I sound/am trying to sound really ""old"" (""this stuff sounds different! And that's bad!!!) But as I said I love the concept of periphery but idk I guess the emo vocals just remind me too much of my awkward high school years when emo was so huge, or something. And the edm-esque drum production..... Whelp no psychoanalysis on that one so maybe I am just getting old!! Fuck"
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","It's not really a question you can answer really. I could sit here and say that Between the Buried and Me and Periphery are massively overrated because I don't like either of them and tons of people do, but that's not them being overrated it's just that I don't like them. The fact that tons of people do enjoy their music kinda shows they're not overrated, seeing as they're just stating their opinion.

As for underrated, give Gazpacho a try. Not prog metal really, more like a mix of Porcupine Tree and Radiohead. They're well worth a listen and I don't think I've ever seen them mentioned on reddit"
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","I wish more people thought like you."
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","Why so many downvotes, i thought it would be a good topic of discussion. :("
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","It just promotes flaming and arguments.

Person 1:""BTBAM is overrated"" 
Person 2: ""Fuck you BTBAM is perfect.""

It just devolves into stuff like that usually. Not much discussion there. People usually leave what they don't like alone, until a thread like this comes and opens up that kind of environment."
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","Oh ok, that's reasonable then."
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","I agree. Think this kind of thread helps bring some redditors back down to reality. Albeit, some become hostile and annoying."
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","What exactly is ""reality""?"
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","Just being rational and realizing your favorite band may have flaws. and that it is okay."
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","Overrated: Anathema, Animals as Leaders (and related), Periphery, Protest the Hero, Between the Buried and Me, Caligula's Horse, The Contortionist, Destiny Potato (and anything Micic does), Haken, Intervals, Karnivool, Leprous, old Opeth, Trioscapes, The Safety Fire, Tesseract

All of the above (except Trioscapes and to some extent BTBAM) are bands that I really enjoy, many even being favorites of mine. But I think they are overrated, especially in terms progressing (vs. Progressive which is the genre) metal music.

"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","Since when is The Ongoing Concept prog? They play them on my local station... Just sounds like typical metalcore to me."
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","Well, they have a decently novel sound, as far as Metalcore goes, and they do the whole mashing of genre's thing way better than most (Metalcore+Ragtime+Western-style saloon music). Also, the last song on Saloon was fucking incredible for a closing song. Are they adventurous? A little, but they are up there with Periphery and Protest the Hero if you ask me and go beyond them by consistently drawing on one or two other sounds that really set them apart."

"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","Most underrated: Headspace

How is this band not more well known in the prog metal circle? Damian Wilson's voice is pure sex, Adam Wakeman and Pete Rinaldi are probably the best keyboard/guitarist duo I've ever heard (keep in mind, that I'VE heard), and *I Am Anonymous* is easily in my top 10 or so favorite albums. Seriously, go listen to [Invasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjFDvEMNGiY). Like, right now.

Most overrated: Opeth

There's a reason I saved this until second. I've never been able to get into this band other than a select few songs, mainly because I feel like most of them are either a) the same death metal song with awesome guitars but overbearing growls, or b) the same softer song, that, while sometimes beautiful, get a bit boring after a while. Still waiting on the moment where someone shows me something that makes them click for me, but for now, I don't get them."
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","Have you listened to Opeth's newer stuff? Little to no growling if you're ever looking to try them again."
"What is the most overrated or underrated band?","Underrated: Threshold

I don't think you'll find another band in metal even beyond prog that has put out such consistent quality music (songwriting, lyrics, etc) with as many line-up changes as they have while maintaining their core.

They're really the only band that gets me excited in the genre (along with Tesseract, who is a half step below). When I saw them live last year and they played this song (before the album was released) I remember thinking that in 10-15 years this section will stick out like a sore thumb and people will mock 2014. But overall a great record. I bet Tosin eventually completely moves away from djent."
"How to Tosin","I was attracted to their music because they seem to write a musical ""song"" that is appealing instead of just showing off skills. I find it more accessible than other djent or prog. He was great live when I saw them too"

They're not the first, nor last to throw a `000000` riff in a song.  It's only 8 seconds of the song, too.  Nothing compared to corridor of chameleons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C8oK88_3AU

"Just saw The Contortionist live.... Holy.Titties.","Just got back from the Toronto show as well. First time seeing any of the bands live, and it was great! The Contortionist was indeed fucking amazing. 10/10

What'd you think of ToothGrinder, Fallujah, and Revocation?"
"Just saw The Contortionist live.... Holy.Titties.","i got off work so i missed the first two but Revocation were really sweet. reminded me of when I saw Trivium right when Ascendency came out, great crowd and you can tell they're about to make a big leap."
"Just saw The Contortionist live.... Holy.Titties.","I hadn't heard of Revocation before this tour announcement, but when I did I really really enjoyed listening through their discography. So much great music by them. I agree they played great."
"Just saw The Contortionist live.... Holy.Titties.","Big leap? They've already got 4 full length releases on Relapse and an EP."
"Just saw The Contortionist live.... Holy.Titties.","In notoriety?"
"Just saw The Contortionist live.... Holy.Titties.","&gt; notoriety

yeah"
"Just saw The Contortionist live.... Holy.Titties.","Toothgrinder was great! My brain automatically associated them with grindcore when I heard their name so I never checked them out prior to the show, so I was pleasantly surprised with their spastic style of prog metal.

I was DYING to see Fallujah as their latest album was probably my favourite of 2014. Their set was really intense, I just wish the guitars were a bit louder. The whole band is so tight with their instruments, especially that drummer!

I think Revocation had the best sound mixing of the night. Dave absolutely slayed! I'm actually surprised that the crowd had so many Revocation fans; I wouldn't think there would be a whole lot of crossover between fans of The Contortionist and them. Witch Trials was easily the highlight of the set (dem solos)!"
"Just saw The Contortionist live.... Holy.Titties.","I wasn't sure what to expect from Toothgrinder at first either, but I listened through their two (Unfortunately short under 20min) EP's before hand and really liked them. Hopefully they put out something a little lengthier in the future!

Fallujah played well but I never really got into them. Gave The Flesh Prevails a bunch of listens and it never really clicked with me.

Loved Revocation, great song writing and tasty riffs/solos. Witch Trials felt like the perfect closer song."
"Just saw The Contortionist live.... Holy.Titties.","I didn't realize they had another EP on top of Schizophrenic Jubilee, I'll check it out! I hope this band gets bigger, they deserve the attention.

I can understand why people wouldn't like Fallujah. It wasn't until their Nomadic EP when I started really enjoying their stuff. The Flesh Prevails has a different feel compared to that EP, perhaps give that a spin and see how you feel about it. If they had made a whole album with Nomadic-style songs I would probably bust a nut, although I still love TFP."
"Just saw The Contortionist live.... Holy.Titties.","Yeah their earlier EP doesn't appear to be on iTunes, rather on their [bandcamp](http://toothgrinder.bandcamp.com/) (Name your price, $0 or more). I prefer Schizophrenic Jubilee but this one is still pretty solid.

I'll check out the Fallujah EP for sure."
"Just saw The Contortionist live.... Holy.Titties.","I have seen them 10 times already and this lineup is really awesome. This tour was cool as they did some new sounds live such as adding the 8 bit intro to Oscillator. Their last headliner with Intervals and Polyphia was nuts when their old singer came on stage during Exoplanet trilogy.

In short, The Contortionist are awesome live."
"Just saw The Contortionist live.... Holy.Titties.","Saw them in the UK a few months ago and damn they were incredible.  Their singer is absolutely hypnotic live, couldn't stop watching him stumble around the stage."

Secondary Edit: I am pleasantly surprised with the amount of responses, also ever so thankful for it too! I can also present the fruits of your commenting labour, the playlist so far ladies and gents: http://grooveshark.com/#!/playlist/Awesome+Proggy+Metal/104500900
Of course still a work in progress, but quadrupled in size since your excellent contributions 
Also a quick apology if my answers are terrible and nonsensical in places, I respond/type at the end of my working day, which is a very long day aha.
Peace and love!"
"Bands Like Plini","It's weird how you use all these longer words, but spell so many of them incorrectly.

Anyway, my unhelpful comment aside, here's some ideas! In no particular order:

1.) [Gru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygiq6AMBGko) - Very spacey atmosphere, fascinatingly kinetic grooves. Also has a very distinct lick vocabulary when soloing.

2.) [Widek](http://widekmusic.bandcamp.com/) - Like Gru, but slightly more aggressive with a bit more chugging. Both are from Poland, and Widek features Gru on *many* tracks, so if you can't get enough of Gru solos on his own album, here's more!

3.) [Cloudkicker](http://cloudkickermusic.com/music) - While I would say that some of his releases are a bit on the aggressive side enough to deter casual listeners, bunch of his stuff is more crossover into post-rock/metal. Fade, Subsume, Let Yourself Be Huge, Little Histories.

4.) [Theo Young](http://theoyoung.bandcamp.com/) - He's like Plini. That's a good thing.

5.) [Axel B. Egenaes](http://axelbe.bandcamp.com/releases) - Just one 3-track ep so far, but nice mix of additional synth and piano textures, less completely guitar-focused.

6.) [Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN0q19AZLbSc_SBpOL-zmb7RzZ5aWsmKy) - Rather cheerful instrumental, arguably not really metal even, but a lot of upbeat grooves. Fun.

7.) [Animals as Leaders](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH22-xSMERQpG4M9HshhXUJ9OKMNlwU8T) - Joy of Motion specifically has very beautiful, perhaps less aggressive songs. Maybe avoid a few of the heavier songs (Kascade, Tooth and Claw, Mind-Spun and Nephele).

8.) [Maybeshewill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9cUYMvcBmQ) - If you've got GIAA on your playlist, I'd put in Maybeshewill, easily my favorite post-rock group, 2 most recent albums specifically are gorgeous.

I've tried to stay within the boundaries of 'completely instrumental, not super heavy', hope that helps!"
"Bands Like Plini","Sorry Michael, unfortunately this work computer has to run IE so I don't have spell check to cover up my real lack of intellect that I try to hide with articulation.
Polyphia is someone I added onto the playlist shortly after this post, I believe a guitarist from Plini is a member of Polyphia?
But you have given plenty for research, thank you for the lengthy answer, god speed sir!

Edit: Holy fuck Theo Young is incredible."
"Bands Like Plini","Theo young is amazing, its absolutely criminal how little exposure he has."
"Bands Like Plini","Yah, I didn't find his ep until at least a month after it came out, completely surprised me out of nowhere! I've since gotten him to do a guest solo on an ep I've got coming out, and that surprised me too, bit more of a nice Zytecki fusion feel. Damn versatile guy."
"Bands Like Plini","The range of his guitar play on that EP alone is mind blowing, actually purchased his EP, hope he comes to the South of England at some point would love to watch his play.
"
"Bands Like Plini","Plini is one dude. And he isn't in Polyphia."
"Bands Like Plini","Correct you are, been traversing through so many bands I'm in a muddle."
"Bands Like Plini","That being said, the guitarists in The Helix Nebula tracked for Plini's records."
"Bands Like Plini","Well, the bass player did. Chris Letchford (Scale the Summit) and Plini are playing the guitar parts from what I understand "
"Bands Like Plini","Scale the Summit are incredible, there new album is in HEAVY rotation in my playlist now! "
"Bands Like Plini","Glad you like Theo, I certainly agree with you! I see similar reactions whenever I mention him as a recommendation, it's great that people are digging his ep."
"Bands Like Plini","CHONNNN"
"Bands Like Plini","Chon are in the playlist broski! They're so funky, LAV IT!"
"Bands Like Plini","David Maxim Micic"
"Bands Like Plini","His stuff has a bit of harsh vocals, though, don't think that's something OP is looking for."
"Bands Like Plini","his 1st album has no vocals at all"
"Bands Like Plini","I've never heard it because I can't find it."
"Bands Like Plini","[Here you are](http://davidmaximmicic.bandcamp.com/album/bilo-10-ep)"
"Bands Like Plini","Oh, there's his bandcamp, forgot about that! Thanks a lot."
"Bands Like Plini","[deleted]"
"Bands Like Plini","Nitpicky, but track 4 has vocals. Not sure about any actual lyrics, but it has vocals. The main melody shows up in every subsequent DMM release, including the Destiny Potato album. "
"Bands Like Plini","[Exivious](http://exivious.bandcamp.com/)

Might be more aggressive than what you're looking for for your shop, but try it on your own.  Especially the new album since you seem to like fusion metal and post-rock."
"Bands Like Plini","I do indeed, so many bands I want to play so bad but can't i.e Corellia(maybe some of there instrumental songs, Sounds of Glaciers Moving, most beautiful guitar tone I've ever heard), Caligula's Horse, Distant Signals, Abscent Distance, Irepress, Aviations and many more!
But I shal check those out in a appropriate enviroment, heh."
"Bands Like Plini","Try [Io!](http://iomusic3.bandcamp.com/album/timeframe) He's a redditor! But hasn't been very active musically."
"Bands Like Plini","I'm surprised noone's suggested [Outrun the Sunlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuY4QQig3vw), they seem right up your alley."
"Bands Like Plini","They have been added swiftly, thank you sir!"
"Bands Like Plini","Two buddies I didn't see mentioned yet - [HAAMOJA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztha4RuNoUM) from Taiwan and [Clement Belio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vadBSlqCHiU) from France. Both great in my opinion although kinda hard to judge what ""like me"" is haha."
"Bands Like Plini","HAAMOJA are fucking awesome man! Thanks for that, I see Plini himself has commented on that EP, must be good heh. Something very Devin Townsend like with Clement, which is awesome!
Edit - Oh wait you're Plini, holy crap thanks for dropping by dude, If you can't tell I'm a big fan of yours, Tarred and Feathered is my favourite song at the moment, obsessed with it! Keep up the incredible work!"
"Bands Like Plini","[i built the sky](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6Lhr1TPKDnU)

[StarSystems](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h1lcKWSN_CY)

I love this type of music, like you said it allows us to listen to our proggy stuff without other people being weirded out haha. Plini and these other bands are a staple for car rides with my friends and family."
"Bands Like Plini","I'm more worried about negative Trip Advisors such as;
""Lovely food, but a terrible racket out the speaker system"" 
But I'm with you brother, the Car is such a great place to open up close family/friends musical tastes to some truly wonderful and talented artists like Plini! We shall convert the heathens one car trip at a time!"
"Bands Like Plini","God is an Astronaut is more like post-rock, but if you like Plini you can try Mestis, Exivious, Chimp Spanner, Scale the Summit, Canvas Solaris, Pomegranate Tiger, Special Providence, Step in Fluid, Gru, Widek and Angel Vivaldi. :)"
"Bands Like Plini","Thanks dude, would explain why I have never seen God is an Astronaught on this subreddit before, maybe I shall explore Post-Rock slightly more.
Thanks for the help bro!"
"Bands Like Plini","You're welcome ! 
Well, Post-rock is not progressive nor metal so, this explains why you have not seen it there haha ! But post-rock is great ! If you like full intrumental post-rock such as God is an Astronaut I'd recommend you Russian Circles, MONO or Explosions in the Sky."
"Bands Like Plini","Russian Circles!! Dayum I forget about them, they are perfect, thank you for reminding me, I've also seen Explosions in the Sky in a few of my related videos whilst searching, they are next on my list!
Thank you pal!"
"Bands Like Plini","Another good band is If These Trees Could Talk, another post-rock band you'd like if you're a fan of God is an Astronaut."
"Bands Like Plini","Russian Circles is so good! I can't stop listening to Enter."
"Bands Like Plini","Post-rock is one genre I enjoy a lot, so here's some recommendations:

- [LITE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlWiRjIcjOk) is a Japanese one, it's Math-rock rather than post-rock, but still fits your needs, I think.
- [Long Distance Calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km0SXsjTFzI) is one of my favorite post-rock bands, but be warned that they like to put some short movie dialogues and things like that in their songs, and some songs have vocals, like [this amazing one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsR0cgJRw-Q)
- [Macaco Bong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjF0Wr_vHg8) is a Brazilian [my country] one that I don't really know how to classify, but they're really good and instrumental only, AFAIK.
- [And So I Watch You From Afar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRD8z4cTjTM) is a more energetic band, compared to most of the post-rock ones.

- And of course, [If These Trees Could Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfJBiR9f9t8), my favorite post-rock band. "
"Bands Like Plini","LITE are great fun man, added! 
If these Trees Could Talk, also added, absolutely gorgeous! 
Long Distance Calling: Well I was trying to avoid vocals, but if the vocals are featuring the legendary Jonas Renkse, exceptions can be made, his voice is perfect for Post-Rock. Dissolving The Bonds is one of my favourite songs ever."
"Bands Like Plini","If you like GiaA check out Maybeshewill. One of my favorite post rock bands! "
"Bands Like Plini","Gru, Scale The Summit, Widek, The Contortionist, Cloudkicker."
"Bands Like Plini","I love Cloudkicker, suprised they didn't come to me before. Shall begin exploring the others, that you for the reply sir!"
"Bands Like Plini","Trees on Mars is a pretty cool new band that has a guest solo by Plini on one of their songs."
"Bands Like Plini","Very nice, added bro thank you 
"
"Bands Like Plini","Check out [Ode to the Vulture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZbpg3BKuGw), it has a pretty sweet solo to it. "
"Bands Like Plini","Harvs is good.

For Giants are like Intervals pre-vocalist.

Toundra are more post-rock, but more aggressive that most other post-rock bands.

Glass Skies are good and proggy.

Walking Across Jupiter are good, but more aggressive.

NOK NOVUM just had an album drop. "
"Bands Like Plini","+1 for Widek, been listening a lot of him lately.
Also the Steve Rothery (from Marillion) solo album is nice."
"Bands Like Plini","[Mestis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfF6Rxd1VfU)!"
"Bands Like Plini","I like this, therefore, I like you. Thank you friend!"
"Bands Like Plini","Dude you would love ""Chon"" or ""The Physics House Band"". They are fucking amazing. A lot of good music coming out these days

Edit : Really good song by TPHB https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdxZ4eoLMn4"
"Bands Like Plini","Yeah I do love Chon, great fun. Good in my playlist to have some upbeat bands like Chon and TotoRo, changes the pace a little. Thanks for the comment."
"Bands Like Plini","Chimp spanner. Intervals. Angel Vivaldi. I think you'd like all 3 if u don't already. "
"Bands Like Plini","Thank you for that friend, also love the Name, Soilwork are bouse!"
"Bands Like Plini","XD"
"Bands Like Plini","One I haven't seen on here: [Their Dogs Were Astronauts.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P4qtM2MT6Y)"
"Bands Like Plini","Kinda like Vjildharta....I fucking love it!! Bit too extreme for my playlist but favorited, thank you very much for the introduction!"
"Bands Like Plini","Walking Across Jupiter.   One of my favorite instrumental albums.    It's always been a name your price on Bandcamp.  So good though"
"Bands Like Plini","I remember stumbling across these a while ago, love the heavy guitars over serene synths. Call me crazy, but a slight Gojira-esk-ness to them."
"Bands Like Plini","Shokran: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3Xd6SWFCs"
"Bands Like Plini","Shokran are awesome, bit to aggressive for my shop, but I'm joining you in the Shokran love brother.

Edit: That is the most awesome album art I've ever seen, also god DAYUM Shokran are sooo good."
"Bands Like Plini","They are amazing and they have a new album coming this year, I'm pumped"
"Steven Wilson - Home Invasion",""
"Steven Wilson - Home Invasion","He's drifting back to his style of song-writing in Porcupine Tree. Heavy shades of both early and late Porcupine Tree.

Glad that the album dived into experimentation after the radio singles on the front end."
"Porcupine Tree - Cheating the Polygraph. A very heavy song left over from the Fear of a Blank Planet sessions.",""
"Porcupine Tree - Cheating the Polygraph. A very heavy song left over from the Fear of a Blank Planet sessions.","I love the Nil Recurring/Blank Planet pair. The way the songs overlap and meld, the re-configured choruses and motifs. It's very smart. They play all the songs from both on the 'Anaesthetize' live album- which is well worth the time."
"Porcupine Tree - Cheating the Polygraph. A very heavy song left over from the Fear of a Blank Planet sessions.","One of my favorite percussion performances of the decade.  Stunning technique and execution. "
"Porcupine Tree - Cheating the Polygraph. A very heavy song left over from the Fear of a Blank Planet sessions.","Probably my favourite drummer of all time :) I love the fills in this segment (particularly the finger rub on the drum skin @ 6:47) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5nAA_QXBPY#t=397"
"Porcupine Tree - Cheating the Polygraph. A very heavy song left over from the Fear of a Blank Planet sessions.","GH is a sickeningly talented man."
"Porcupine Tree - Cheating the Polygraph. A very heavy song left over from the Fear of a Blank Planet sessions.","The live version of this song off the Anesthetize DVD is even better to be honest. You should give that a listen as well."
"Decortica - Duality (from A New Aesthetic)",""
"Decortica - Duality (from A New Aesthetic)","Not technically prog metal, more influenced by it, but I see Deftones and similar posted here occasionally so some of you may appreciate it. One of the best Kiwi rock bands in a long time."
"Decortica - Duality (from A New Aesthetic)","Now we're talking...  "
"Decortica - Duality (from A New Aesthetic)","And now im twenty bucks poorer but three albums richer.  Thanks for the tip on this band. "
"Decortica - Duality (from A New Aesthetic)","No worries :) Thanks for supporting them!"
"RED SEAS FIRE - Blood Bank (OFFICIAL VIDEO)",""
"RED SEAS FIRE - Blood Bank (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Man, they've come a long way from their s/t in 2011. I remember hearing the breakdown in Timeframes and being so confused at first. Definitely what got me into djenty music. "
"RED SEAS FIRE - Blood Bank (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Because their name reminded me of The Safety Fire [I know, I know, not really similar] I gave it a listen with pretty high hopes. But they're a pretty run-of-the-mill djent band. Not a bad band, but nothing out of the ordinary.

But the lighter part at the end was really good! I liked it quite a bit."
"RED SEAS FIRE - Blood Bank (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Nolly came from this band."
"RED SEAS FIRE - Blood Bank (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Nolly is one of the members from TSF? I don't usually know the names of band members."
"RED SEAS FIRE - Blood Bank (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Not TSF. Red Seas Fire. Nolly was originally from RSF. Nolly as in Nolly from Periphery :P "
"RED SEAS FIRE - Blood Bank (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Well, I had mentioned TSF, so I assumed it was from it. Like I said, I rarely remember band member names :P"
"RED SEAS FIRE - Blood Bank (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","I love this band but keep getting really unlucky and missing them live to the point where I've even had tickets but not been able to get there."
"RED SEAS FIRE - Blood Bank (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","That sucks -- I'd kill for them to come to the US."
"Secret and Whisper- Warrior (Southern Arrowwood)",""
"Secret and Whisper- Warrior (Southern Arrowwood)","I like Secret and Whisper, but I wouldn't say they are metal. They're definitely rock. Still good though."
"Secret and Whisper- Warrior (Southern Arrowwood)","I mostly agree, but I see them in kind of a gray area. It's a pretty fine line between metal and rock in my opinion. Especially when you get in the category of progressive. "
"Secret and Whisper- Warrior (Southern Arrowwood)","I agree with you there. There's a lot of grey area with art in general, which is why it's so amazing. Nothing is clearly defined. Art, and music, truly is a reflection of who we are."
"Secret and Whisper- Warrior (Southern Arrowwood)","So true. Glad we agree. I had doubts about Secret and Whisper fitting in this sub too, but I view them as *just* heavy enough to push it over the edge. This song just has a great powerful feel to it. "
"Secret and Whisper- Warrior (Southern Arrowwood)","I love his vocals. Their first album is really good from what I remember. I have a lot of saddening memories from a few years ago that seem to surface. It makes me pretty sentimental."
"Enslaved - In Times (OFFICIAL ALBUM STREAM)",""
"Enslaved - In Times (OFFICIAL ALBUM STREAM)","what a way to start the week!"
"Enslaved - In Times (OFFICIAL ALBUM STREAM)","FINALLY. "
"Enslaved - In Times (OFFICIAL ALBUM STREAM)","New Enslaved album streamed for free by Nuclear Blast themselves?

Today is a good, good day indeed."
"Enslaved - In Times (OFFICIAL ALBUM STREAM)","I was surprised the album didn't fade out halfway through."
"Enslaved - In Times (OFFICIAL ALBUM STREAM)","I can't wait to see them with YOB!"
"Enslaved - In Times (OFFICIAL ALBUM STREAM)","Ya, so stoked.  The decided to skip out on my town when the were touring with Amon Amarth.  Thankfully they are kicking it off here headlining, which makes up for it."
"Enslaved - In Times (OFFICIAL ALBUM STREAM)","Hmm, wasn't a fan of those beginning screams."
"What are your favorite prog metal songs? Share!","Yeah, what are your most beloved tunes? Just list a couple, I'm interested to see what I might be missing out on and what's everybody into!

"Just curious, how many of you guys are music majors?","Progressive music has alot of deep musicality and tonal depth. How many of you guys are music majors? Or how many of you guys love diving into the depths of the music and studying the little intricacies? "
"Just curious, how many of you guys are music majors?","I wish I was, or had at least studied music in more detail. Theory is hard when you're trying to figure it out on your own!"
"Just curious, how many of you guys are music majors?","Yeah man. I feel I do ok without theory. It just makes it more challenging sometimes. You say you are the same and your stuff comes out pretty good 😉"
"Just curious, how many of you guys are music majors?","Unfortunately, a degree in Music wasn't very realistic for me. I am thinking about pursuing a degree in some sort of audio engineering related field."
"Just curious, how many of you guys are music majors?","I personnally would only recommend that field if you're more interested in the more technical sides of AE or are willing to combine it with a dual major or a minor in electrical/mechanical/computer engineering. Or choose one of them with a minor in AE if it's possible. I only say this because pretty much everyone I know who majored in AE at my university has ended up working at guitar center or something like that and has been unable to find anything better or anything steady at all. It's been this way for 6-8 years for all those guys now. If you're mainly interested in mixing/mastering/sound design I'd recommend just using the vast resources on the Internet and honing your craft at home. Invest your money in good equipment and spend your time practicing and not going deep into debt. Not trying to crush your dreams just giving you my experiences. "

"Just curious, how many of you guys are music majors?","I was a composition major at university of Akron for a semester and dropped out because my parents said they wouldn't support it, despite putting both my sisters through school for violin and cello performance. I was in theory class with classical and jazz musicians and I knew all the answers and no one else knew jack shit. The classical kids thought I was a rockstar because I liked to party once a week, and the Jazz kids saw me as a nerd who would do their homework for them. I was like, ""fuck this, I'll write the songs they teach to these goofbags."" Now I bus tables 15-20 hours a week and am working on about 5 different rock opera while honing my vocals and pro tools skills via pop and hip-hop collaborations, and maintaining performance through solo acoustic arrangements of 20+ of all those songs. I don't get laid, obviously. I like to analyze most music but I love prog metal because of the atonality of bands like periphery, Sikth, the faceless, rings of Saturn, and of course the Meshugganer dudes. I purposefully do not analyze it much because I love the feeling of being in space and/or death and destruction and/or jumping around with bunnies in the woods I get from bands like that. Although I definitely took the time to figure out the time signature of ever forthright's ""little Albert experiment.""

"Advice for my first prog show","Hello, thank you for reading this. Here is my dilemma. Both Haken and Chon are playing at the same venue on the same night only 30 minutes apart.

http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=5629145&amp;pl=webhall&amp;REFID=whsite

If you were in my shoes who would you see? I really like both bands and have been stuck on this for a while. I thought about Haken first because it is their first American tour and 3rd show in the US. Kind of special right?

But I also really enjoy Chon and would love to see them live. 

Again, who would you choose? Thank you for reading this!"
"Advice for my first prog show","Haken, for sure. Chon tours the US fairly often. Haken does not come here often at all. "
"Advice for my first prog show","Haken. Seen them once live and it was amazing.  
  
Oh maybe because I haven't listened to Chon yet, so I *might* have a biased opinion."
"Advice for my first prog show","I would go to both concerts since I would regret not seeing the other band if I chose to see one band only. "
"Advice for my first prog show","I would love to do this but problem is they are playing at nearly the same time on the same day. I would have to try and sneak into the other show where I can be kicked out promptly and see neither band and leave sad"
"Advice for my first prog show","Why can you not buy two tickets and go to both shows? I've never listened to Haken but Chon is one of my favorite bands- I'd go see Haken just because they may not be back for a while / until the next album cycle. "
"Advice for my first prog show","Definitely Haken.  Chon not only tours often, but they're about to drop a new album anyway.  Once that happens, you can expect to see them everywhere.  "
"Advice for my first prog show","I think the show he's seeing would be for Chon's new album."

"Steven Wilson - Ancestral","Wow. I was a bit underwhelmed by the first couple of singles released, but after listening to this and Home Invasion, my hype for this album shot skyward."
"Steven Wilson - Ancestral","Too early to call this the album of the year?"
"Steven Wilson - Ancestral","I don't blame you for it, but I'd be waiting to see how BTBAM VII turns out."
"Steven Wilson - Ancestral","Did they say it would for sure be released in 2015?"
"Steven Wilson - Ancestral","Apparently they've already finished recording. That's a hell of a post production cycle if it isn't coming out this year.

But yeah, this album is amazing."

"Steven Wilson - Ancestral","I'd say Juggernaut still has this beat out"
"Steven Wilson - Ancestral","I don't think I could even compare the two. "
"Steven Wilson - Ancestral","Wasn't this the song they teased with Ninet's voice? Wonder why it was taken out for this release, I was really looking forward to hearing the whole section with her voice."
"Steven Wilson - Ancestral","That's Routine you're talking about - and it is, imo, the best song in the album."
"Steven Wilson - Ancestral","Actually I just found this out yesterday on /r/StevenWilson, but Ninet was actually supposed to sing ""Go back if you want to."" It's in the first studio update towards the end, but in a Dutch interview that Steven and the band didn't really feel like her vocals were suited for that part.

However, I think that the original version with her vocals will be on the demo version of the song."
"Steven Wilson - Ancestral","Yup, I was wrong. Someone took the mix of the studio videos and mashed up the way the song was originally planned and it was sick. I prefer it over the album, tbh:

"Rush - Caravan",""
"Rush - Caravan","They did a really good job of modernizing their sound on this album."
"Rush - Caravan","I remember hearing this for the first time and thinking ""damn, the masters [Rush] are learning from the students [specifically Dream Theater]""! The whole album definitely has some of Rush's heaviest stuff."
"Rush - Caravan","Rush has been one of my favorite bands since I started liking music, and I never really considered them Prog Metal.  This song I can agree with, but I always see them classified as prog metal.  Do you think they really fit into that label?"
"Rush - Caravan","They're kinda prog proto-metal occasionally, in the same way that Led Zeppelin is sometimes considered proto-metal.  At the very least they're heavily influential on early prog metal bands."
"Rush - Caravan","I heard this live pre-release as an encore track on the Time Machine tour... It was my first concert.

Great stuff."

"Porcupine Tree - The Rest Will Flow","Indeed. I just put that because there's almost always some moron that wants to debate what is and isn't metal or what is and isn't prog each time I post something that isn't clear cut."

"Porcupine Tree - The Rest Will Flow","I still can't get it past my head that Steven Wilson wrote a happy song. "
"Porcupine Tree - The Rest Will Flow","Right? It's fucking beautiful though."
"Porcupine Tree - The Rest Will Flow","I love this song and this album and nearly everything Wilson has put out, but you could have picked a heavier and (imo) better song off this album. Lightbulb sun, hatesong, Russia on ice."
"Porcupine Tree - The Rest Will Flow","Russia on ice.. man I haven't heard that in forever.  Going to go listen to it now."
"Porcupine Tree - The Rest Will Flow","They've done some amazing stuff but that song would be in the top 3 for me."

"Psycroptic - ""The World Discarded"" (new song)","The production and riffs are amazing, I hope the vocals won't ruin this album."
"Psycroptic - ""The World Discarded"" (new song)","There are very few tech death bands I'd say I love, but this is definitely one of them. Never gets old."
"Psycroptic - ""The World Discarded"" (new song)","I agree! I'm a huge fan of Joe Haley's guitar work, even though it seems to be a contentious subject other places on the web. It's fascinating to me that guitarists of his technical ability seem to mature into a preference for structuring riffs rhythmically instead of concentrating on flashy stuff. Vogg's work on the latest Decapitated record is another example of this trend. "
"Psycroptic - ""The World Discarded"" (new song)","My favourite thing about Pyscroptic for sure is definitely the guitar work, I don't get why it's so contentious like you said. I also loved the drumming on Blood Mantra."
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire",""
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","I'm not sure if Ghost Reveries is the ""best"" Opeth album, but it's definitely my favorite."
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","Yep, this and Damnation are my favorites :)"
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","Same. It's quite a masterful experience. And that applies to bot GR and Damnation"
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","I'm glad i'm not the only person that feels this way haha. Right now Damnation, Ghost Reveries and Pale Communion have the most plays from me, in that order."
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","Nope it's their best, GR was easily their peak, went downhill Watershed on wards. "
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","I hated Watershed when it first came out but have been giving it another chance lately. I now register it as 'not bad'. I don't know if my tastes changed or it just makes sense in context (understanding that they were going into Heritage sound next) but there's some good stuff on that record"
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","The riff in Hessian Peel is one of the greatest Opeth riffs ever. 

You know the one. "
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","The first 3 songs on watershed are really good imo"
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","I would say 90%~ of fans cite Blackwater Park as the peak. I very rarely here GR as being cited as such. And do you think they went downhill after Watershed because of the prog direction they took and there not being much death metal? Because that's a poor way to judge the band, imo. "
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","Whilst I love Blackwater Park, Ghost Reveries for me will always be the best album they made. BWP comes 2nd for me, but only slightly. Perhaps I favour GR because Ghost of Perdition is my favourite song from Opeth all together. 

I feel they went downhill with Watershed itself actually. Without turning this into a whine about genres, Watershed for me was just a poorly made album, it has good *parts* in songs but not good songs themselves. Heir Apparent is one of their heaviest songs, but it's still crap. So I wouldn't call it the change in direction, just the songs are more forgettable. Whilst I tend to skip Atonement, Hours of Wealth and Isolation years on GR because I feel they are just filler for the remainder of the rest of the songs that are 10/10 for me, Watershed just has average songs throughout in my opinion.

As for Heritage and Pale Communion, they are just bland and wasteful to me, it's not that they aren't death metal, Damnation is a brilliant non Death metal album, them two though just waste your time with songs that don't go no where, fail to impress or even interest me. I've given both complete listen throughs a good few times, each time I lose interest and just left thinking ""That was it?"". Needless to say, it's been a steady let down from Opeth for me since around 2008, shame really."
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","I feel like you're missing out on GR as a whole if you skip Atonement, Hours of Wealth and Isolation years. The ending of Hours of Wealth leading into The Grand Conjuration makes both those songs so much more powerful. I'm just as big of a fan of Opeth's soft songs as I am their heavier songs, so this is all just my opinion. But I feel that's what Opeth is all about....or at least was about until their change of direction."
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","I thought it was good, but it doesn't compare to My Arms Your Hearse and Still Life in my opinion, although trying to choose a favorite out of so many amazing albums is still really hard."
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","I also really like Blackwater Park. "
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","Definitely my favourite and probably my favourite prog metal album of any band."
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","Love this album, Reverie / Harlequin Forest is my favorite song."
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","Love that jazzy soft break in this one. "
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","I feel like I am the only one who considers Watershed as their favorite Opeth album"
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","Right with you buddy. I just find myself constantly listening to Watershed the most.

For me it's got the right balance of the newer prog stuff, technically cool riffs, really heavy metal, some beautiful melodic singing, folk stuff and a whole lot of just weird and dark sprinkled through it as Mikael was really going through his Scott Walker phase."
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","Yes, that's why I love it so much! The balance :)"
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","I like Watershed over Ghost Reveries at least. But nothing touches Blackwater Park."
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","Blackwater Park is their best by far. Amazing album. "
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","I would probably put Still Life before BWP, but both are amazing albums. Just comes down to opinions."
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","Its my favorite too, but that may be because it was my first Opeth album"
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","Dat groovy intro! Ugh so good. 

Also, I can never get enough of the rhythm and music that accompanies Mikael when he sings the lines, *""wept for solace and submit to faith. In his shadow I am choking, yet flourishing. Master!""* Now THAT is a transition. "
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","I hated this song the first few times I listened to the album. Not sure why, now it's one of my favorite songs of theirs."
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","The intro, first growl verse and then the clean singing section are all so good. This is one of my favourites from GR, but it doesn't seem to get much attention"
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","This will finally be played live in October. I really wish I could go :/"
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","This was the first song I heard from this album back then and I was blown away!  It's still my favorite on the album. IMO very underrated. Would love to hear it live!"
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","I'd flip my shit if I ever was fortunate enough to hear this live. One of those perfect Opeth songs. From the soft midsection onwards this song just fucking slays, musically and lyrically. One of my favorite guitar solos ever as well. Last album with Peter and Lopez, first one with Per as a member. Super random, but I remember dipping out of a homecoming dinner at Olive Garden to go to Circuit City across the street to pick this up. Ahhhh, homecoming, this song, Circuit City, the nostalgia. "
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","I'm glad you guy like this album. "
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","This was the first Opeth song I've ever. I was blown away when I first heard it. Then I listened to the rest of the album...."
"Opeth - Beneath the Mire","This is definitely my favorite album with Still Life behind it. I would then say Damnation comes in at number three. I fucking love Opeth!"

"Devy's Z2 Question, ""we find a lone moon...a strange moon made of bone and dust.""","On the last track, Dimension Z, Ziltoid and Blataria end up seemingly alone on a distant moon made of bone and dust... Now if you listened to Devin's Casualties of Cool, the story in that one is about a man on...a far away moon, where he discovers the moon is actually a monster, and he ends up building a bridge out of bones at one point, because bones were scattered everywhere.  Do you think this is the same place?  Do you think it was just a little ""easter egg"" or are we going to get some insane blues/prog hybrid album?"
"Devy's Z2 Question, ""we find a lone moon...a strange moon made of bone and dust.""","I think I saw on Devin's twitter or something that he says it is in fact the same planet.  Dunno what that means for future releases, but at least you know that for sure now."

"Dream Lineup (Prog Metal/Djent/Whatever)","For me it would pretty much be if Brandon Baker (ex-Veil of Maya vocalist) joined After the Burial, or if Tosin Abasi had made being part of Born of Osiris a permanent thing. That's actually how I first heard of him, right around the time the first AaL album came out he was a touring guitarist with Born of Osiris and I was like ""Damn I didn't think they had a black guitarist, who is that guy?"" 

I'm a little leery of just throwing a bunch of random guys from different bands together because the whole is not always equal to the sum of parts, know what I mean? Seems hard to predict who would actually play and write well together and who would just add up to a wank-fest."

I'm in a Baltimore-based band and we're looking for a vocalist with a wide range of harsh vocals. I would label our music as progressive metalcore, but we like to experiment with a lot of different genres when writing our songs. We have a lot of musical influences from a plethora of different metal subgeneres. If you or anyone you know is interested in this, or is looking for a band to be a part of, feel free to hit me up!

I was, to my suprise, able to hold the attention of my class, which consisted mainly of average 17 y/o's. 

It remained quite interesting to play this song in front of the enite class, from beginning to end, amongst some other DEP song fragments and although they seemed a bit shocked at first, once I started explaining how this sort of music devoloped, they actually seemed quite interested.

I used to be in a pop punk band back in 2002.  We opened for Dillinger, haha.  It was a pop punk show - like 5 pop punk bands - and then Dillinger closed the show.  Oddest crowd you have ever seen.  We played right before Dillinger, and when they got on they started by saying something to the effect of ""That band sucked, enough pop punk garbage"".  My band mates and I were so happy they mentioned us haha."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","I don't know if they are any more, but I feel like Dillinger used to be such dicks about bands that don't break the mold. Greg especially. I've read interviews from the early aughts where he shits on bands like Atreyu and Avenged Sevenfold for being generic.

Like, calm down dude, you *just* joined this band. I'm all for idiosyncrasy and artistic integrity, but the elitism is annoying, and shitting on younger bands who are just trying to play their music and have a good time is weak. You don't seem like you're too upset over it, but it irks the shit out of me."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Yeah.  Now that I'm older I really frown upon anyone judging anyone else just because of the music they listen to.

But as far as Dillinger, I just took it as ""part of their image"" and brushed it off.  I feel like if a metal band makes fun of a pop band it's just pandering to their fanbase.  Like a metal band is supposed to hate pop bands.  It's a shame that's the way it is."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Word, it's all just a part of the larger metal elitist trend, and I think that judgment is one of the main things alienating any newer would-be fans. Sometimes I feel like a lot of metalheads are *trying* to distance themselves, and it kind of sucks."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","It's ironic that Greg would be a dick about bands not ""breaking the mold"", when he just formed a supergroup that sounds pretty generic."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Right? Killer be Killed is good, but the only thing they *really* have going for them is star power."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Wings of Feather and Wax fucking rocks, but it's so vanilla. It's like anti-Dillinger."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Funny story. When i saw DEP live it was after 7 bands including periphery and animals as leaders. Feel alseep leaning against the wall during their set whike this was blaring and strobe were at full speed."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Summer Slaughter? Haha they were calling us out on not being an active enough crowd, but they played after most of us had been there for 7+ hours. Still such a sweet show."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Yep! Summer slaughter. I give them props for those creepy ass gifs on loop on their background screens"
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","This is one of my very favorite favorite songs from one of my favorite bands.  I always say that I listen to so much metal that I'm pretty much desensitized to it.  It doesn't really hype me up or anything, most metal I treat as casual listening.

But this song is the only song I'm aware of that can make me involuntary headbang.  It's one of the most aggressive songs I've ever heard.  Just the way it's mixed and the attitude in the guitar riffs somehow got conveyed through the mic and through the mixing, it's just fucking gnarly.  

Honorable mention to Bleed by Meshuggah. I know we've all heard it dozens of times, but it's one I think is not overrated.  It's is a titan of groove. "
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Probably the best concert opener ever."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","God damn it this song live is one of the craziest things I've ever heard"
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","It was so sick seeing them live when they opened with this!"
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Not prog metal"
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Just so you know, we had a short discussion about this album a few weeks ago:

http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2sdimu/the_dillinger_escape_plan_understanding_decay/cnor4tb"
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","i wasn't there for that, but i'd agree with the point that progressive metal or music in general seems to be more classically structured and the dynamics and weirdness seems to be branched off from classical structure. DEP doesn't fit that description. "
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","TBH, I also think DEP isn't prog. The reason you're getting downvoted is because you didn't actually try to explain your reasoning, which is actually something a lot of people would've agreed with."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","i don't really care about the down voting, but yea that's definitely why. just some useless 2 cents i didn't really think i'd have to dive into. "
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Enlighten me, please."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","well, it's obviously just my opinion. But DEP has always been a hardcore band. Very chaotic with poly-rhythms and layering- which i don't think makes a band progressive. Progressive to me is more about melodic elements and that band's sound in a particular time period. I will admit that DEP, ever since Ire Works, has become more dynamic musically, but again i don't think that necessarily makes them progressive metal- or even metal. Wasn't trying to ""enlighten"" anyone."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Nice! I disagree, but it would have been very cool to have your well-stated opinion in your original post. DEP obviously isn't writing 12 minute songs or three part suites in classic prog fashion, but they incorporate so many outside influences and have turned their original metalcore sound on its head in a way that I would consider prog."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Are they mathcore / metalcore?"
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","TDEP is very much a metalcore band. I don't use the term ""mathcore"" but it usually refers to very technical, chaotic metalcore."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Mathcore to me was more about having weird time signatures and the effect it produces "
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Yea, of course. They were a part of like a second wave of mathcore/math metal in my opinion"
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Who was in the first wave?"
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","I'd say bands like Botch or Ed Gein "
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","I'm not sure about Ed Gein but after reading through Wikipedia  Converge, TDEP and Botch all produced a mathcore album within a year of each other."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","Ed gein was earlier I'm pretty sure, of course I could be wrong again. But then I'm not sure. Although I've heard bands from the 80s who were proto mayhcore in a sense. "
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","I know you explained yourself elsewhere, but I just wanted to give my two cents. I feel like progressive music itself isn't a clearly delineated genre, more of an avant-garde attitude toward making music, which can exist within any genre. The very nature of prog is always shifting and changing because falling into a pattern and putting limits on the music goes against the very definition of the word ""progressive,"" in my opinion. Dillinger may not be straight metal per se, but they're definitely heavily influenced by metal, especially with their newer stuff, so I think it has a place here.

Also, how in the hell are you being downvoted? I don't even have the option to downvote on this sub, lol."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - ""Prancer""","I agree with what you said about the time it came out, which was one of my points. And one of the reasons I don't consider it prog.

"Savatage - Prelude To Madness / Hall Of The Mountain King","Great band that are criminally no longer with us for no real discernible reasons...! I was always in the Zak Stevens camp. I love Jon Oliva but personally I don't think he's even close to a good vocalist - a great personality and driving forced behind the band, and an average keyboard player - but a great song writer.

I fell in love with them when I saw them supporting Judas Priest in 2001, they had a new singer called Damon something...Jiniya or something like that...anyway that dude commanded the stage like no other...totally captivating. That was the Poets and Madmen tour for them I think...

Anyway I got into Zak era Savatage and basically went nuts for them for years...loved that guy's voice and everything he did on Handful of Rain etc...but this truly is one band that have split their audience down the middle by line up and directional changes...I felt real hostility on their old message board when talking about Zak era stuff...!"
"Savatage - Prelude To Madness / Hall Of The Mountain King","I go for Jon Oliva as the lead singer of the group

He and his late brother made a fine team together but to each his own , I suppose."
"Savatage - Prelude To Madness / Hall Of The Mountain King","Yeah I can't argue Cris was an amazing guitar player...I can see why people are in the Jon camp and also why they see some of the Zak stuff as massively fucking pretentious...but I dunno, parts of Handful of Rain can bring me to tears, some of the lyrics affect me quite deeply, they really resonate...I dunno it is a case of each to his own as you say - personally the thing that sticks with me is how this band can be so take it or leave it to so many different kinds of people, even the hardcore fans...it's not like Ripper era Priest or Van Halen and Roth splitting, or whatever...it's so much more divisive than that! Either way though, no matter which era you prefer, they have released some absolutely stonking metal and prog metal tunes - and they have always put on a fantastic show which I was lucky enough to see twice - a real gem in the metal world and a worthy addition to anyone's collection of metal! I'd take Jon back as singer just to see them live again and releasing albums...the real tragedy is that they are no longer producing music under the name of Savatage."
"Savatage - Prelude To Madness / Hall Of The Mountain King","If only Criss Oliva was still with us....

"Savatage - Prelude To Madness / Hall Of The Mountain King","I will never forget the first time I heard Hall of the Mountain King.

I was a sophomore in high school, stoned out of my mind, watching metal mania with my good friend. This was a typical weekend for us and we knew most of the songs being played on this show...or so we thought...

This magical song came on and we both thought it was the greatest thing we've witnessed in a very long time. The music video and continuous metal screams the singer gives near the end blew us both away. I miss these kind of nights...

I ended up buying the album and went through a pretty big Savatage stage for a while.  "

"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","Played this loud on my telly with the lights off. I fucking cried my eyes out. Absolutely wonderful song, and I can't wait for the full record."
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","I love that he's showing more of his storyteller side. ""When I was thirteen I had a sister for six months"" is a chilling line to start a song, almost a complete story on its own."
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","an odd song to release out of the context of the whole album but I guess he wanted to show a song that showed the theme of the album.  "
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","Feels like a teaser thing rather than a legit song release."
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","Yeah this song seems like one that would benefit more from its context within the album as a whole. That said, I still found it quite beautiful and a nice taste of what is to come. And the video for it was gorgeous as well."
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","People are hating on the song in general expecting Steven Wilson to be a generic progressive rock artist... but he's so much more than that. While certainly not a song you would hear in Raven, it certainly carries the signature SW emotion."
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","Not what I expected, but I loved it! I wonder why Lasse Hoile didn't direct."
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","Lasse's style is generally really bleak and dark which doesn't seem to be what Steven was going for here. I guess that's why."
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","If I recall, Lasse's doing some other work somewhere for the album, maybe for the deluxe edition book and whatnot.  It seems Steven's reaching out to work with other artists, as he did with Hajo Mueller and Jess Cope on Raven material.

Plus Lasse seems to be working with other musicians lately (directed Anathema's last DVD for one) so he might just be busy.

Your point is probably also a factor."
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","I watched this and then bought tickets to one of his shows. 

I had an opportunity to see him in Blackfield a few years back. During the 'Welcome to my DNA' tour. But SW father passed away when he was supposed to play. So, unfortunately yet very understanding, he canceled. 
That was my only opportunity to have seen him because he rarely tours anywhere around where I live. 

Now I'm second row! 

I'm very excited. My dream show is seeing SW play! Woo! "
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","I saw him in 2013 during the Raven tour. He was brilliant."
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","That's awesome. I really wanted to see him on that tour. I swear I didn't take that album out of my car for a solid 8 months. Haha. I still listen to it and get goosebumps. "
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","So simple, yet so beautiful. I love everything this guy does."
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","Beautiful song, but I really hope the narration is for the video and not part of the song or all over the album."
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","Pretty sure it is on the song. Definitely not all over the album, maybe a few more bits here or there."
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","I also hope it stays song specific. There's a [site](http://handcannoterase.com/) with lots of journal entries by what I guess to be the ""protagonist"" of the album?"
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","I found it kind of boring :/ I hope I enjoy it more with the whole album. "
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","Cute song. 

I want Ancestral tho :("
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","I can't stop listening to this. "
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","For a hoot I shazammed the song and it was identified as ""Perfect Life (Grand Union Mix)""  which is listed as a ""special feature"" on the BD version of the album...   So I am not too sure if this is the actual thing we we'll be hearing on the album itself..  "
"Steven Wilson - Perfect Life","It's like a read a middle chapter in a book. Really odd single but the song is pretty cool."
"Looking for Prog Metal bands with unique vocalists","I know that's a bit of a broad request, but I've just noticed that a lot of the bands posted on here all have that same sort of tenor vocalist, and I'd like to find something more interesting. Some examples would be Fair To Midland, Twelve Foot Ninja, The Faceless, etc.

EDIT: For clarification, certain tenor vocals are ok, I just get tired of bands that sound like Periphery and Intervals
EDIT 2: Also, I'd prefer there to be at least some clean vocals, but I'm totally fine with mixed vocals."
"Looking for Prog Metal bands with unique vocalists","Mastodon (three vocalists I believe, one has this really great gravel always in his throat)

Dog Fashion Disco (baritone singer, I believe)

Biomechanical (kind of schizophrenic with the vocals in a way that kind of reminds me a little of Sikth, but if one dude was doing it)

Children of Nova (singer is a Tenor, but the tone he has is pretty cool and his style is a little more operatic)

Nevermore (singer was a professional opera singer at one point and you can tell if you listen to Year of the Voyager, their live album. Dude doesn't burn out like a lot of singers seem to.)

Cynic (their newest album aside, and maybe Re-traced, they used a lot of vocoder vocals. Even still, Masvidal does have a very soothing style of singing and keeps a nice, soft tone)

Diablo Swing Orchestra (styles of singing covered: opera, swing/jazz, and more all with two singers, I think)

Mike Patton (pretty much everything)

Daniel Gildenlow (again, pretty much everything, but I would start with The Perfect Element Part 1)

Disperse (kind of similar to Masvidal's style, but with more 'oomph' at times)

Estradasphere (pretty much everything)

The Great Gamble (A Bass/Baritone singing Dream Theater/Symphony X style vocals over similarly styled music)

Symphony X (Russel Allan is a beast of a vocalist, vocals ranging all across the normal Baritone range and from gravelly and demonic to clear and angelic)

Ihsahn (black metal styled harsh vocals and cleans that are somewhat reminiscent of Masvidal, in that they are quite soft compared to many other singers, but can be powerful when need be)

Kamelot (Siege Perilous-Poetry For the Poisoned since that is the era of Roy Khan who brought a kind of poor-man's Warrel Dane style, though he is no slouch)

Orphaned Land (very Middle-Eastern tinged music from THE Israeli Prog Metal band and the vocals have the same tinge to them)"

"Looking for Prog Metal bands with unique vocalists","I've found [Amenra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kX2HiyRs6o) to have pretty unique harsh vocals.

"Looking for Prog Metal bands with unique vocalists","Bro, if you love Fair to Midland, you have to give [Rishloo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtgOEKrd2EE) a try. Andrew Mailloux's range is on par with Darroh's, and even outshines him in certain places. This is coming from someone who idolizes Darroh as well :P

As for other ""unique"" vocalists go, hard to sift out, but out of thos that haven't been mentioned, you've got [Dream the Electric Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-juOIqUAQNA) (higher register that sounds a little like the previously mentioned Children of Nova), [Headspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwNw4XLYpKQ&amp;spfreload=10&amp;noredirect=1) (grandiose style, Damian Wilson is a house, also sings for the band Threshold), [Cog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmo-I9wBmjM&amp;spfreload=10) (punkish, Flynn Gower wasn't even supposed to sing for them, oddly enough), [Eden Circus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbDith4ymNY&amp;noredirect=1) (gravelly, I think of Death Cab for Cutie sometimes for some odd reason), and [Anubis Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFXTwxzJdn4&amp;spfreload=10&amp;noredirect=1) (another ""grandiose"" vocalist, with a German flair)."
"Looking for Prog Metal bands with unique vocalists","I've given Rishloo a few listens, and I really enjoy them. The vocals feel like a combination of Maynard from tool and Darroh. I just wish Mailloux did some of the throat singing that Darroh does. Dream the Electric Sheep are really interesting, both vocally and instrumentally. Headspace is amazing, his vocals blow me away. Eden Circus was good, but didn't wow me. I already love Anubis Gate, so I'm always glad to see someone mention them."
"Looking for Prog Metal bands with unique vocalists","Raiju."
"Looking for Prog Metal bands with unique vocalists","Cog have one of the most unique vocal styles I've heard.  Unfortunately I think it's one of the reasons people are put off initially, but worth checking out :) Someone below mentioned them too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOTFUmK3Uw"
"Looking for Prog Metal bands with unique vocalists","Schizoid Lloyd - vocalist is a low baritone and has a really full voice (many of the other members contribute vocals too, though).
And seconding the people who mentioned Devin Townsend, Pain of Salvation, Disperse and Uneven Structure."
"Looking for Prog Metal bands with unique vocalists","Some bands that come to mind are Evergrey and Katatonia.

Both have very emotive vocalists that are quite atypical for prog metal."
"Looking for Prog Metal bands with unique vocalists","Check us out @Derivate we do backing vocals live sometimes, but there is only one singer on our brand new EP! It's in the line of Mastodon, BTBAM... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IKgmTJHAbo"
"Looking for Prog Metal bands with unique vocalists","Try [Means End](http://meansend.bandcamp.com/).

I don't know much about classifying vocalists but the vocalist's style doesn't have that poppy element you find in Periphery or Intervals.  It's more operatic.  

The instrumentals are weird melodically, to say the least.  One unique element is the near-constant SATB choir harmony track that adds a spacey / dreamy feel.

"Leprous - Waste of Air","This comment made my head spin. Could you have worded it differently?"
"Leprous - Waste of Air","I said ""least best"" instead of ""worst"" because I actually think Leprous is a great and extremely talented band, so even what I perceive as one of their weaker songs is still pretty darn good. But I think the composition of this song is too...aggressive (in the chugging guitars and, particularly, in the ""YOU ARE A WASTE OF AIR"" vocals) compared to the complex instrumentation and vocal melodies/harmonies that I think make them great."
"Leprous - Waste of Air","They are indeed a cut above most prog bands these days. Can't wait for their new album"
"Leprous - Waste of Air","I dunno, the ability to periodically use aggression but not just rely on it is another thing that makes them great.  You get songs like this one and Contaminate Me (and the bonus track Bury from Coal) without getting burnt out on everything being really heavy.  Makes them more dynamic as a band."

"Haken - Pareidolia","I'm so partial to the ""*Cockroach King*"" that I can't fully agree with you, but it's definitely a close second. That said, ""*The Mountain*"" is such an amazing album, that is really quite hard to choose."

"Haken - Pareidolia","Haken is slowly replacing Dream Theater as my favorite band. I remember first discovering Aquarius and loving it, then when Visions came out I was even more excited. The Mountain just completely blew me away, and Crystallized off of their new EP pretty much sealed the deal for me."

"Haken - Pareidolia","Haken has the sound Mike Portnoy wanted DT to become. "
"Haken - Pareidolia","Except they all had to have a more jazzy approach, which then hardly ever did (perhaps a bit in the post-Berklee times). Ruddess could add the classical vibe to it, but I don't think that Petrucci would ever move in the jazz phrasing path. Dream Theater are more metal, Haken are more cross-over between metal, old school prog and jazz/classical. I think this is why they are widely considered as the next evolutionary step of prog (a.k.a. *the next Dream Theater*)."

"Haken - Pareidolia","This whole album is amazing. I saw them live in Leamington Spa last year. I was a bit worried before, as I thought that if the singer had a bad night the band would sound dreadful.

I really like the Saturday Jam #1, too, that was originally how I'd stumbled across him, a video of Maciej Dzik from Disperse [playing through it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31TA5yRQ6E), such a nice song. Apparently Maciej is doing drums for Owane's album, but who knows when that'll be..."

What's that thing on the top of his guitar though? I always see people with that but no one really explains what it is."
"""Owane"" - Saturday Jam #3 ... This kid deserves some of our attention","It's to avoid string noise. I play an 8-string guitar myself and I have a similar improvised contraption close to the end of my neck. It's really helpful if you don't want any random open strings to start resonating while you're playing, and that's bound to happen with that many strings. With a 6-string guitar your palm is big enough to mute most of the strings but that won't do the job when you've got 8 strings."
"""Owane"" - Saturday Jam #3 ... This kid deserves some of our attention","It's just his sock being used as a capo lol"
"""Owane"" - Saturday Jam #3 ... This kid deserves some of our attention","Haha ah that helps a bit then. Sometimes you see them having some kind of felt thing on the top that isn't on any fret though. I guess it limits the feedback or something, but I never really found a product or anything that comes close to those things."

The solo to Racecar always slays me when you listen to the 8-bit version.  It's out there on youtube.  "
"Another Year - 8bit - Animals as Leaders","It's interesting how a lot of prog metal fans seem to get into The Reign of Kindo. I discovered them from one of Luke Holland's drum covers."
"Another Year - 8bit - Animals as Leaders","It is interesting! I love them too, even though they're not remotely metal and only progressive here and there. Maybe prog metal fans are just more likely to appreciate great songwriting and musicianship even if it doesn't really fit in the genre?"

"Another Year - 8bit - Animals as Leaders","And here I am thinking that AAL couldn't be any better. This sounds ridiculously good. "
"Another Year - 8bit - Animals as Leaders","I love how meta it is that there's an 8 bit version of a reference to a funny video online in this song.

For those who don't know, the song has a joke reference to ""the lick"" when the lead guitar first kicks in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krDxhnaKD7Q"
"Another Year - 8bit - Animals as Leaders","The Lick has been a recognized thing since long before that video, it's a purposefully referential bit of melody in a lot of jazz solos. The recent crossover to its use in progmetal is funny, though! "
"Another Year - 8bit - Animals as Leaders","Well yeah, I was assuming it was pretty old like that, someone would have HAD to have pointed it out before the dawn of youtube. But it didn't become widespread knowledge before that video :P"
"Another Year - 8bit - Animals as Leaders","Awesome work! This tune in particular was practically composed for an 8-bit remake. Such a strangely upbeat and different sound for AAL, which is why I love it, it's an abrupt island vacation in the middle of dank prog metal grooves."

It is IMPOSSIBLE to screw up filming these guys. They're insanely violent on stage but nail the songs every time. Crowd response is huge and the room buzzes from start to finish.

MowwMoww: I'm not sure if that's accurate. I chat to them pretty often and that's the first I've heard.

"Nothing More - Mr. MTV (Closest thing to Fair to Midland you'll get)","Their sound is pretty awesome, but this album has the worst lyrics I've heard in a very long time. It ruins the music for me."
"Nothing More - Mr. MTV (Closest thing to Fair to Midland you'll get)","Yup. Vaguely anti-establishment mediocrity, or vaguely philosophical/religious questioning. That's definitely an area that FtM was amazing, they really had wonderful lyrics.

Same reason why I didn't actually post the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXxHwOkYEYs) for this song, fairly cringey to go with the lyrics. Would rather just try to focus on the timbres than actual words."

I'm ambivalent towards NM's lyrics. They're certainly not Pop Evil levels of bad, and songs like ""Jenny"" and ""God Went North"" are personal and do feel like they have some emotion attached to them. That being said, there are definitely some cringe-worthy lyrics on here."
"Nothing More - Mr. MTV (Closest thing to Fair to Midland you'll get)","So lyrically nothing special, but the range of vocal styles and instrumental textures make this a pretty cool song, especially the bridge is a bit of surprise. This album swings from metal to altrock, but quite a few memorable earworms. I miss FtM, so it was nice to find something similar (catchy tunes, cool if not overly complex guitar work, easy to follow song structures that still can throw a curveball once in a while).

I haven't listened to any of their earlier stuff yet, had checked them out a couple months ago when I saw they would be touring with Periphery and enjoyed it a lot. Speaking of which, their live show was great, some cool elements that really put on a show beyond just playing the music. Could have been gimmicky and cheesy, but they pulled it off really well."
"Nothing More - Mr. MTV (Closest thing to Fair to Midland you'll get)","While I'd hesitate to call these guys prog, they certainly have some easily identifiable influences. It's cool to visit their Facebook page and see bands like Twelve Foot Ninja, Karnivool, and Fair to Midland quoted. 

Their newest album actually ended up being one of my favorites last year. Out of any band that gets mainstream play, I think these guys were the most deserving of the number 1 single they got. Looking forward to seeing them in February."
"Nothing More - Mr. MTV (Closest thing to Fair to Midland you'll get)","Their last album, The Few Not Fleeting, has some songs that definitely remind me of FTM. This album, not so much but the song God Went North might have you thinking of FTM"
"Nothing More - Mr. MTV (Closest thing to Fair to Midland you'll get)","Just saw them last night and they put on such a cool show. Made a new fan."
"Nothing More - Mr. MTV (Closest thing to Fair to Midland you'll get)","It's cool. I wouldn't call them prog though. More like metalcore. "

"The future of Djent?","So, the latest Periphery Album were both loved and hated. Everyone can at least agree that Juggernaut is a long way from their first EP. 

Bands whom were previously against the sound as well as the use of electronic effects have now adapted to the sound. And if history has taught us anything, adaptation is the beginning of the downfall, as well as mass production. The smaller bands who used Djent based sound now has had their one hit and now retracts to their main fanbase.

Periphery has in some ways been the ""face of djent"" as in the way of they should have some credit for making people aware of the sound. And people have been criticising Periphery for ""going too poppy"" on their last album. Do you guys think that now that record-companies has sucked out the last of the djentlemen or do you think the wave has yet to hit it's peak?

TL;DR: Is Djent going to become bigger or smaller?"
"The future of Djent?","To be really honest. It peaked before the genre had really taken off. "
"The future of Djent?","http://www.lefthandedtoons.com/toons/drew_bassbear.gif"
"The future of Djent?","I feel like the 011000110000011000 stuff is getting old, but I think it has given a great gift to the scene in that more interesting time signatures and rhythms are more widely accepted. I'm sure the djent won't die out for a long time, as we see more ""mainstream"" bands like Nothing More carrying that influence into a more general light, but the types of bands we most commonly discuss here are going to move onward from it. Just my opinion."
"The future of Djent?","I agree. The elements of it are quite fun. But like Bulb/Periphery did help inspire a generation of bedroom guitarists to learn poly rhythms and syncopation through his own work and his love for Meshuggah. Subgenres of subgenres can only last so long, you're definitely right, but I kind of hope history whittles it down to the gems. i.e no Northlane or anything.

Edit: grammamamer"
"The future of Djent?","Lower tuned guitars. "
"The future of Djent?","Wouldn't it be awesome if Djent got as big as Dubstep did? Seeing Djent breakdowns in the middle of Britney songs.  I mean, I would hate everything it stood for, but it would still be hilarious.

The popularity of genres is not what is interesting about music.  Where music is most interesting is at the fringes of genres, that's where the interesting stuff happens.  Djent is a genre born at the fringe between Progressive metal and Industrial metal.  It'll happen again some place else.  Progressive rhythms on mid-rangey guitars isn't going to disappear - it's where you can take that stuff that matters."
"The future of Djent?","Meshuggah was doing this before anyone, and they exposed people to 'djent' long before Periphery.  

It was at it best before all these derivative 'djent' bands formed. "
"The future of Djent?","Not saying they invented Djent, but they were the reason the sound got mass-produced, and record labels found bands that played with Djent-sound as well."
"The future of Djent?","No one was doing djent before '98 so they did invent it."
"The future of Djent?","I meant Periphery."
"The future of Djent?","oh lol"
"The future of Djent?","I wouldn't be surprised if more electronic elements get implemented and we come full circle back to nu-metal. 

As far as the future is concerned, it's all a matter of what Meshuggah does. Everything djent related begins and ends with the band that ultimately started it. Everyone else is playing catch-up to that sound. 

Periphery has the ""pop"" sound down to a tee, but aren't necessarily pioneers of the genre, Bulb aside."
"The future of Djent?","That's kinda funny, I've been thinking lately how a lot of djent is not unlike nu-metal in presentation. Ultimately it's just another gimmick-based metal sub-genre that seems to follow the novelty-mainstream success-backlash-disownment formula as we have seen before with nu-metal and metalcore (and its many derivatives). You could even argue that's what happened to glam rock and grunge in the 80s and 90s respectively, but the music culture has changed a lot since then.
You have to progress or be swallowed whole once the collapse comes."
"The future of Djent?","I see that one can think that, that is what I meant. I'm not saying they are the pioners of the genre but they are the reason lots of record labels started to mass-produce these bands. IMO Periphery is the most popular band with the ""Djent"" mark on them. They've grown bigger than Meshuggah but they have a unstable fanbase, as fans of Meshuggah will be there 'til the end."
"The future of Djent?","I don't know where you get this information from. Meshuggah are a much bigger band. I've watched them headline a festival and seen them with Periphery as support. "
"The future of Djent?","Well, mostly its off hits on official music videos and plays on for example itunes, spotify etc."
"The future of Djent?","Meshuggah have about 15 years extra worth of album sales. "
"The future of Djent?","Yes, but they are not known for the Djent. And I'm not saying they are worse than Periphery, I like Meshuggah more. But when it comes to the popular Djent-type scene right now, they are less popular. "
"The future of Djent?","I'd completely disagree. They are the beginning and end to the genre. "
"The future of Djent?","So you think that their sound is what defines the Djent-hype?"
"The future of Djent?","Well, between them and siKth. Yeah."
"The future of Djent?","But... Neither Meshuggah or SiKth are catchy. How can they lead the pop-djent when they make good music well thought out music instead of catchy tunes?"
"The future of Djent?","What are you on about? "
"The future of Djent?","I think your on the down side of the genre. It feels a bit like Deathcore in 2009. It was good for a good while but then you grew tired of the sound because it got stale. Then in 2010/11 a fuck ton of new bands released music that took off into the stratosphere and started djent as a genre. The only difference between then and now is that the core bands of djent never really embraced the label to begin with. I don't think Misha ever intended to call Periphery a ""djent"" band. Same with Tesseract and the Contortionist. That's why they latched onto progressive metal as a genre. They've left it for greener pastures and everybody else is stuck making 0000 000 00 0 000000000 on a 8 string drop f geetar. I'm not saying it all sucks. There's a clear divide between the best, the good, and the shit with djent more than most genres. "
"The future of Djent?","Once everything gets too poppy then people will rebel against that sound and we will have grunge djent."
"The future of Djent?","and then Post-Grunge-Djent! Nickelback but with 8-strings **cringe**"
"The future of Djent?","Djent has no future"
"The future of Djent?","Vildhjarta's ""thall"" sound is the next step in djent I think. Personally not a fan of djent 95% of the time, only Vildhjarta and Meshuggah really use it well (Periphery have a couple of tracks that use it properly such as The Walk)."
"The future of Djent?","You think so? I like Vildhjarta but I can't see that the general metal scene will appreciate this sound. For me it's more of a heavy niche-sound for those who wants to go deeper. "
"The future of Djent?","There are certainly great artists making music that incorporates a lot djent elements and a few that will continue to do so.

But the demographic is growing up.
"
"The future of Djent?","djent is to metal as dubstep is to electronica. It started off cool when other countries were doing it for years before it reached the U.S. and then the U.S. fucked it up by making it more accessible, then dumbing it down, then over producing it, now there is a new djent metal band every fucking day- just like dubstep producers. 

not prog metal"

"Karnivool + The Contortionist North American Tour leak!",""
"Karnivool + The Contortionist North American Tour leak!","Oh fuck yes"
"Karnivool + The Contortionist North American Tour leak!","If this is real than my life has officially reached it's climax. Holy shit. "
"Karnivool + The Contortionist North American Tour leak!","Personally, I think Karnivool is one of the best bands to come out of the last decade of music.. possibly even longer than that.  Surprisingly though, I've tried to introduce many friends to them with similar musical interests, with little success.  Their loss, I suppose."
"Karnivool + The Contortionist North American Tour leak!","It might be because you're hyping them up a bit too much.

I mean they're good... but ya..."
"Karnivool + The Contortionist North American Tour leak!","When I introduce a band to someone I try and leave my own opinions out of the conversation.  I can hype them all I want on a website where at least one or two other people are most likely going to agree with me though."
"Karnivool + The Contortionist North American Tour leak!","For what they are I mean I agree that they're the best thing at what they are....since Tool.  I mean they're basically Tool.

The Contortionist on the other hand, was pretty boring on the BTBAM Parallax tour when I saw them.  If it was with someone else I'd probably go and see it, I really enjoy Karnivool."
"Karnivool + The Contortionist North American Tour leak!","I've been a fan of Kanivool for years but never had the opportunity to see them live since I live in Ohio.  I've heard very good things about their live performances so to me it wouldn't matter much who the openers are.  The Contortionist I can't say I'm a fan of, but their recent album I think is really interesting, much more so than their previous efforts, which were basically just scream-only djent albums with slightly more rhythmic complexity than the average.

On a side note, I get where the comparisons to Tool originate, but I hear a lot of people compare bands to Tool simply because Tool doesn't fit into any traditional category of music, and neither do Karnivool.  I simply don't seem to hear as much similarities in their music as some do.  I don't compare any band to Tool, really.  Tool is Tool.  Hopefully they grace our ears with another album sometime this decade."
"Karnivool + The Contortionist North American Tour leak!","That is a very unfortunate opinion of TC's first two albums."
"Karnivool + The Contortionist North American Tour leak!","I have never been able to appreciate Tool, yet I am an enormous fan of the 'Vool.

I am broken, I know."
"Karnivool + The Contortionist North American Tour leak!","You are not alone. I like a couple Tool songs but for the most part I find that they're being complex just for the sake of being complex and that a lot of their discography is just a mess of sound in odd time signatures and isn't particularly meaningful. Karnivool may have the *sound* of Tool with the beautiful guitar work and driving bass, but 'Vool has meaning and purpose to the complexity of their songs. Also Ian Kenny."
"Karnivool + The Contortionist North American Tour leak!","I hope they have a show in Toronto!"

"Looking to expand my listening catalog, bands similar to Dillinger Escape Plan","Greetings, 

I started listening to Dillinger Escape Plan about 3 years ago, and really got into them about 2 years ago. They were really my first introduction into prog metal! My favorite album is Ire Works and my favorite song is widower. I like Greg's vocal range, and I essentially slowly started to enjoy their heavier and noisier tracks. Widower is my favorite melodic track, and Milk Lizard (I know it isn't the heaviest) is my favorite heavier track. I particularly like how Greg's throatier vocals go from somewhat understandable, to all out reckless vocals. 

I read a bunch of interviews with Greg in particular and worked my way backwards based on their influences. Nine Inch Nails came up, and Trent is okay, I prefer his movie scores and instrumentals. I have been trying really hard to get into Mr. Bungle, but a lot of it sounds like strange circus music. I like ""California"" okay. I prefer Patton's work with Faith No More. 

I like everything I have heard from Tool. When I was a wee lass without a very developed musical taste I bought just by chance the BTBAM album colors, and really liked the track ""Prequel to the Sequel"". I'm also a big fan of Mastodon and Baroness. Not prog, but I was raised on Southern Rock, bands/songs with Southern Rock influences I would probably like."
"Looking to expand my listening catalog, bands similar to Dillinger Escape Plan","Definitely check out Sikth."
"Looking to expand my listening catalog, bands similar to Dillinger Escape Plan","Ire works is my favorite Dillinger album as well! They're definitely one of those bands that sort of walks a line between progressive metal and a more hardcore punk sound.

I'd check out Protest the Hero (insane guitarwork and excellent vocals), Converge (mathy hardcore, very little clean vocals, but definitely one of Dillinger's heavier influences), and Exotic Animal Petting Zoo (especially their album ""I Have Made My Bed in Darkness;"" weird ass guitar effects and a good mixture of heaviness and softness).

Based on your favorite Dillinger tracks and your other suggestions, it seems like you might like more straightforward metaly stuff. Try Hark, I've been jamming them a lot recently."
"Looking to expand my listening catalog, bands similar to Dillinger Escape Plan","Omigosh! I'm listening to PTH: Volition right now and I already really like Rody's vocals. I'll check out the other recs as well! Thanks."
"Looking to expand my listening catalog, bands similar to Dillinger Escape Plan","Hell yeah. I'm just suggesting shit as it comes to me, so if you're a fan of that vocal style, you may enjoy The Fall of Troy (I'd recommend the album Doppelganger) and Coheed and Cambria.

Another that just came to me is The Human Abstract. Their album Nocturne is beautiful. "
"Looking to expand my listening catalog, bands similar to Dillinger Escape Plan","i'm gonna suggest some noisier stuff that might fall more into the range of mathcore than progmetal, but they're the bands that i know of that are similar to DEP

The Hirsch Effekt is probably the most similar that i know of. [Fixum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPtyCR8S3S0). [Absenz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfBiPXtLTrQ). they've got a pretty diverse sound and go all in between slow/melodic and crazy/noisy.

Psyopus has a bit less range (pacing-wise, at least) and is more consistently noisy, but they're just as experimental and mind blowing as DEP. [The Pig Keeper's Daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIiYwKO88aY). [X and Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVOBHtm0r0).

The Crinn - [Meat Eating Machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqN8Gupjc4g) (note that the video uploader accidentally repeated the song,  it's not actually that long)

An Isle Ate Her - [Easy, Charles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi-0_9fV_Gk). this one's got weird vocals, but i personally think the music is worth getting used to them.

Car Bomb - [This Will Do the Job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4nBM8MtX-g). oooh, trippy album art.

okay, i've heard that Botch is really similar to DEP but i've never really listened to them, so i looked them up. and yeah, i think you'll like em. [Transitions from Persona to Object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Q87LFycXI). they're new to me, and i'm really digging it.

lastly, these guys aren't very similar to DEP, but i saw that you were enjoying Protest the Hero. if you like them then check out [Raiju](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcjup4uxzEQ)."
"Looking to expand my listening catalog, bands similar to Dillinger Escape Plan","Psyopus might take some getting used to, but it's sooo worth it. Fucking Arp is an alien."
"Looking to expand my listening catalog, bands similar to Dillinger Escape Plan","No one has recommended Toothgrinder? [They just released an EP and music video not to long ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3PagrocKk). They are a recent hidden band that needs to explode in popularity. The first thing that comes to mind is DEP when I listen to them but they are just *really* good."
"Looking to expand my listening catalog, bands similar to Dillinger Escape Plan","Best EP since Hunab Ku's rewiring process"
"Looking to expand my listening catalog, bands similar to Dillinger Escape Plan","Edit: Added more bands I've enjoyed. 
"
"Looking to expand my listening catalog, bands similar to Dillinger Escape Plan","Someone else recommended [Botch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brqZ6jZiOFE), which I would second. They aren't as dynamic as DEP, nor do they sing much, plus 90s metalcore production can get kind of claustrophobic, but they're truly an awesome band. It might sound a little dense or lacking in range at first, but over time you'll pick out what makes them so legendary.  
  
My other recommendation would be [Intronaut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVcxDsY3vv4). The vocals are all in the throat and depending on where you are in their discography, they range from growls to yelling to singing. They're usually lumped in with Mastodon and Baroness and though they don't have a Southern rock sound, they should bring something to the table that you'll enjoy."
"Looking to expand my listening catalog, bands similar to Dillinger Escape Plan","Dillinger are my favorite band alongside Meshuggah. So obviously I listen to lots of music that have ""similar"" styles. Even better when they have influences from both those bands.

Some of my favorite ""mathy"" bands are Botch, Converge, Sikth, The Safety Fire, Equal Minds Theory, Torrential Downpour, Toothgrinder, Exotic Animal Petting Zoo, Car Bomb, Psyopus, Rolo Tomassi, Destrage, See You Next Tuesday(Psyopus with more Death Metal/Grindcore), Dionaea, The Crinn, Carnivores At Grace, Every Time I Die(southern influenced), The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza, Sectioned, Cave In, Protest The Hero, Enabler, The Chariot, Coalesce, Ion Dissonance, Hunab Ku...

I hope that was helpful :D There are some more heavy and some less heavy bands in there. some with southern influence, some more hardcore, some more metal, but all very good in my opinion"

"Remember those rumors of a Karnivool US tour? Looks like it's not actually happening :(","This is one band I'll never understand. They seemed poised for greatness after the 2nd album. Then the 3rd album was a disappointing mess (being harsh) then they refuse to tour the US after successfully touring Australia and Europe like mad. 

I think this is a band that is afraid of success. "
"Remember those rumors of a Karnivool US tour? Looks like it's not actually happening :(","Completely disagree with regards to Asymmetry. While it didn't have quite the same immediacy as Sound Awake, it really grew on me with it's subtle, understated intricacies. The production, while less digestible at first really lends itself to a more live band feel which makes the soft parts feel more delicate and the big parts even harsher and uglier. I love asymmetry, and think cuts like Aeons and Eidolon are some of the best Karnivool songs to date."
"Remember those rumors of a Karnivool US tour? Looks like it's not actually happening :(","Sounds good. What about Themata?"
"Remember those rumors of a Karnivool US tour? Looks like it's not actually happening :(","I didn't get Asymmetry when I first heard it, actually, but it really grew on me. It has even more of that Karnivool *ick*-ness than Themata and Sound Awake. Their music has that feeling of *existence is nasty and shitty - but maybe that's ok*, which is so much more important (I think) than the metal bits.

I wish I could see Aeons live. Someday... (but apparently not in April...)"
"Remember those rumors of a Karnivool US tour? Looks like it's not actually happening :(","Asymmetry was fucking beautiful man "
"Remember those rumors of a Karnivool US tour? Looks like it's not actually happening :(","Asymmetry is about the most original and well written rock album in recent history. 

Seriously, maybe it goes over people's heads, but the intricacy of their writing is astounding.

Go listen to aeons like five hundred times."
"Remember those rumors of a Karnivool US tour? Looks like it's not actually happening :(","I think it's an overreaction to call Asymmetry a ""mess."" Yes, it was less polished and arguably not as good as SA, but that's like trying to be better than perfect. SA's one of those once in a lifetime things where everything on that album just fell into place in exactly the right way for so many people. Yes, bands always strive to be better than their last album, but how many fall into the trap of trying to make their defining album over and over again and sounding stale?

Asymmetry was Karnivool stepping back from the precisely-made trappings of SA and making their sound more raw and organic. There may have been some unneeded filler and some songs that were a little weaker, but it was by no means terrible. ""Aeons,"" ""Sky Machine,"" and ""Eidolon"" were among my favorite tracks of 2013, and it easily found its way into my top 10 albums of that year. It's a shame it gets shit-talked by fans as much as it does."
"Remember those rumors of a Karnivool US tour? Looks like it's not actually happening :(","[deleted]"
"Remember those rumors of a Karnivool US tour? Looks like it's not actually happening :(","You need to listen to the album a couple of times with some good headphones.  The album is what it's called: asymmetric.  Chaotic.  Disorderly.  The time signatures clash, guitars battle each other, the drums are cacophonous.  The bass is distorted and booming.  It's a lot to take in the first listen.

But the album is all about finding the order in the chaos.  Listen to it a couple more times, and you'll see that it is creative, thematic, and cohesive.  Ian sounds (imo) amazing, he really belts it out at points.

I'll admit that Sound Awake still remains my favorite Karnivool album, but Asymmetry has some of my favorite tracks they've put out, including Nachash, Aeons, and, most importantly, Sky Machine."

"Solefald - World Music With Black Edges - [7:56]","I'm surprised there are not more Solefald fans on here. The new album, Kosmopolis Sud, came out the other day and it's pretty damn good. It's also very strange, as one would expect from Solefald. There's passages (apparently) inspired by Dutch Techno, percussionists from Zanzibar and much more. ""Bububu Bad Beuys"" is especially odd. World Music isn't just a phrase here.

In my opinion the best prog album of the year so far. At the least it's the most original."

"Royal Thunder - Shake and Shift (Couldn't decide if this is prog metal or some hard rocky prog)","They are pretty borderline, but yeah, w/e, still quite good.

"Liquid Tension Experiment - Rhapsody in Blue","Loved what they did with the Gershwin piece, but what I can't figure out is why the super tame video/lighting effects? Of course their collective musicianship is extraordinary but I've always loved a show to have some kickass lighting and visual effects as well. "
"Liquid Tension Experiment - Rhapsody in Blue","I mean, their tours were more of just a few shows that are organized to be very cheap, so that's probably why.  Renting Lights/Video is really expensive, and when the tour is 10 dates it's not really worth it."
"Liquid Tension Experiment - Rhapsody in Blue","Yeah it was a reunion tour and it seems like they wanted to keep it more casual as well. Still doesn't take away from what an awesome interpretation of the original they performed. "
"Liquid Tension Experiment - Rhapsody in Blue","I really hope they do another tour, but it really depends on JP.  Mike and Jordan actually have a good relationship and always have since the split, but from my understanding, John isn't too happy about Mike."

Working rock shows are some of my favorite gigs so I'm more surprised that such a famous band can't get a budget together. Most venues have existing setups with house technicians anyways "

Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is the sixth full-length studio album by progressive band Dream Theater, released as a double-disc album on January 29, 2002 through Elektra Records. Excluding the A Change of Seasons EP, it is the first Dream Theater album to feature a title track."
"Dream Theater - Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence","Of course I know it's an album, but what he linked is not the full album, it's the title track."
"Dream Theater - Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence","its not just the title track, its the entire album. for example, listen here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIsQyhfS-YI&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=1006

this is very clearly _The Test That Stumped Them All_, track 4 of the 6 Degrees album.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIsQyhfS-YI&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=2363 Here is _Losing Time/Grand Finale_. the final track of the album.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIsQyhfS-YI&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=1196  Here, this is _Goodnight Kiss_.

The entire album is 42M 2S, which is the exact amount of time that Wikipedia reports the album length as being:

Total length: 42:02

We, the fans, may see  this as a single song/entry in DT's repertoire, however for all intents and purposes, this is listed, labeled, and marked; as a singular album in it's entirety.


[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVMIk3xYaYo), however, is the Title Track of Octavarium, all 24M 1S of a 75M album.


Edit: I love DT just as much as anyone else, however if the rules are to not post full albums, don't post full albums."
"Dream Theater - Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence","It's allowed, I'm calling it.

Disc 2 of Six degrees, which is all of what was posted here, is one song.  Read the wikipedia article you yourself referenced.  The 6 Degrees suite is explicitly described multiple times as a single song, broken up into 8 tracks.  To post the full album, he'd have posted the songs on Disc 1 as well.

Are you confusing the term ""album"" and ""disc?""  Or ""song"" and ""track?"""
"Dream Theater - Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence","Are you not overall familiar with this release? It's a two-disc album. He only posted disc two, which is composed of the SDOIT title track. "

"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""",""
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","The last 3 mins or so in this song are just magical....one of my favorite moments from TC"
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","Even better live."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","I cried.

Actually, everyone cried. It was beautiful."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","This and Casualty. Best songs on Intrinsic IMO. Hell, the whole fucking album is a masterpiece. "
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","Intrinsic Contortionist is best Contortionist imo"
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","I think I like Intrinsic just a little bit more than Language, but I like the line-up on Language far more. I feel like the whole band, as a collective, just have this awesome chemistry with each other now. They're phenomenal live. "
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","Probably around once a day I find myself skipping to the 3-minute mark and listening to one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've ever heard."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","""Please do not miscalculate my tone"""
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","The tapping section is one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard "
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","Amazing when performed live, they totally immerse themselves in the music.  Particularly at the end of this track."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","Cameron always looks like he's having a blast playing live hahaha! They were in Norway in November but I didn't get to see them which bummed me out quite a bit..."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","I saw them in Denver...front and center right in front of Mike. Easily the best show I've ever seen!"
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","They only did about a half hour set when I saw them sadly, would love to seem them blast out a good 1.5hr set doing the best of all three albums.....then when I think of it I'm like well I guess they'd have to play all 3 albums in their entirety.  Its seriously hard to think of a track that wouldn't be worthy of a live rendition."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","They NEED to play Feedback Loop. That's one of my favorite songs and they have never played it live to the best of my knowledge."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","Dude I would kill to see Feedback Loop and Exoplanet! I saw them in October and it was amazing but they played mostly Language stuff."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","I've seen them play feedback loop live. Can confirm, it was awesome. 

Best song i've seen them play live though is Oscillator. That long ambient section near the end... Just magical."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","I went to see them in Joliet, Illinois last year and they played Oscillator. Everyone was moshing in slow motion during the ambient part at the end. It was incredible "
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","That sounds amazing. When/where was this? I've loved them for years but I only got to see them in October at a small place in Syracuse."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","I think it was back in 2012. It was before they changed vocalists, and right around when Intrinsic came out.

I haven't had a chance to see them play anything from Language live yet though"
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","When they played Language 1 into Language 2 it was amazing. I'm not a big fan of Primorial Sound, tho. I thought that was boring. They finished with Flourish and that was really good, even with Mike instead of the old vocalist"
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","When my friend saw them, they ended up having way more time than expected and said, ""So it looks like we actually have enough time for one more song... except... it's three songs.""

And everyone cried tears of joy."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","It was Causality that peaked the show.  There's something about live progressive that really hits you on an emotional level, I was in complete awe."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","This is fantastic. Thanks for the share. "
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","You need to go listen to this entire album right now. I've been following these guys since Shapeshifter in 2008, and I personally think it's the best thing they've put out."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","Already on it. Thanks though :) "
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","Saw these guys open up for Protest the Hero.... Literally the weirdest thing I've ever seen. Dude yells for a little then goes to the back near the drumset (still visible) and faces away from the crowd on his haunches. Stays that way up to 5 minutes. Freaking weird. 
"
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","Yeah the vocalist does look like he isn't experiencing the same world as the rest of us, but I think he just really feels the music on such an intense level and he isn't afraid to express that in his own way and I think that is also reflected in his skill as a vocalist - one of the reasons Language at least for me was one of the best albums I've heard. The passion and feel is there"
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","Mike Lessard easily has the most unique stage presence I've ever seen from a singer, and it completely fits. Just like u/icecubenscc I was kinda weirded out the first time I saw them play (also opening for Protest) but the second time I saw them I knew what to expect and his stage presence was captivating. That combined with his incredible vocal skill make him even more fun to watch and listen to"
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","I have a lesson with Cam tomorrow. Do you guys want me to ask him about specific songs or anything? I'm definitely going to learn Anatomy Anomalies, Cortical, and Feedback Loop."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","I want to know what their *exact* tuning is. They say standard in interviews, but they're definitely tuned to like G#. I just need to *know*.

Also if you could post tabs or a video of how to play [this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJyIhPMSS5Y) from Feedback Loop I would love you a lot."
"The Contortionist - ""Geocentric Confusion""","Luckily I have a very good idea of what their exact tunings are. There are 3:

1) A# D# G# C# **F** A# D#

-Contact

-Vessel



-Dreaming Schematics

-Anatomy Anomalies 

-Sequential Vision (not entirely sure about this one)



2) **G#** D# G# C# **F** A# D#

-Primal Directive

-Flourish

-Expire

-Advent

-Oscillator

-Exoplanet I-III

-Holomovement 

-Feedback Loop

-Causality

-Geocentric Confusion

-Cortical

-Solipsis



3) A# D# G# C# **F#** A# D#

-Axiom (although you dont even play the low string on this one)

-As far as I can tell, the entirety of *Language* is in this tuning.




What part of Feedback Loop are you trying to link? The video just starts from the beginning of the song. I really want to learn from [this part](http://youtu.be/rJyIhPMSS5Y?t=1m43s) part of the song onwards, especially the lead guitar part. Also, [here is my rough tab of Anatomy Anomalies](http://i.imgur.com/drDrvMJ.png)


EDIT: [Here is a clip of me playing one of the leads from Anatomy Anomalies](https://vid.me/ro8W) (its so short because it was an Instagram clip)

"Periphery show Ft Lauderdale...","the show in ft lauderdale was great. very solid performance by everyone. including Nothing More and Wovenwar(they were fantastic). But I was a really disappointed by the fact that Thank You Scientist weren't able to make the show, and also the fact that Spencer developed strep throat. (I know these things happen and I'm not blaming them for it). it lead to playing only so many songs and some had to be played instrumental. I guess what I'm trying to say is that all in all my friend and I didn't feel we got our monies worth. Misha if you ever read this please come back soon and play scarlet (I didn't get to hear it D:)

edit: grammar"
"Periphery show Ft Lauderdale...","I know a lot of people around here would almost *prefer* an instrumental Periphery set/tour haha That sucks, didn't know Sponce had strep. Hope he gets better soon. As a singer there's nothing worse than not being able to sing"
"Periphery show Ft Lauderdale...","A couple years ago I saw them with Protest and TSF, and they played a full instrumental set. It was magical. I don't mind spencer though, especially on a lot of the new songs."
"Periphery show Ft Lauderdale...","Damn, I'm going to the show mostly to see Thank You Scientist... I'd be pretty frickin bummed to not see them. "
"Periphery show Ft Lauderdale...","Damn, that sucks that they had to do some songs as instrumentals. I saw them in Tampa (which was the previous night) and Spence was able to make it through the set. Although, their set was incredibly short for a headlining band, which was rather disappointing. "
"Periphery show Ft Lauderdale...","Dang, what a bummer. Hopefully TYS car troubles are fixed, and Spencer's vocals are healed by the 28th."

"The Ocean - The Origin of Species + The Origin of God","I don't care how much love The Ocean gets, this band needs more. They are far too good to ignore."
"The Ocean - The Origin of Species + The Origin of God","I agree. The Ocean blew me away the first time I saw them in concert. Had no idea who they were before... it was glorious. "
"The Ocean - The Origin of Species + The Origin of God","These were the first two The Ocean songs I'd ever heard, so damn amazing. I listened to this album weekly with Crimson for about a year."
"The Ocean - The Origin of Species + The Origin of God","After falling madly in love with both discs of Precambrian, I avoided their newer stuff for the longest time because I didn't think it could measure up, especially knowing the major lineup changes.  Boy was that foolish.  Last 3 albums are amaaaazing and I like that they're sticking with this vocalist, he brings a lot to the table.  I see a lot of people trashing Anthropo/Helio for some reason but to me they're pretty even with Pelagial which seems to get a lot more love.  "
"The Ocean - The Origin of Species + The Origin of God","I love both albums but for me the biggest problem is the amount of pure filler on both, especially with heliocentric. I found myself having to make separate playlists that removed a good chunk of the songs just to get through repeat listens."
"The Ocean - The Origin of Species + The Origin of God","Hell yeah, love this album and it's counterpart, Anthropocentric. What a unique group. "
"The Ocean - The Origin of Species + The Origin of God","Such a fantastic band live. Greatest memory would definitely be Loic pulling me in to scream vocals with him, and then him subsequently jumping onto my face. Lol."
"The Ocean - The Origin of Species + The Origin of God","Heliocentric is one of the albums I have to listen from start to finish. It's a great experience every time."

Also the entire thing was engineered by Sam Vallen also of Caligula's Horse."
"Arcane - Learned (Jim Grey of Caligula's Horse's other band) - [23:16]","Listened through the new album a couple of times. I like it more than the last but I still think Jim's work is better with CHorse. Idk, maybe the albums will grow more on me. Still is great though"

"New Saturday Jam by Owane!","How about Plini :p"

"Wilson wouldn't lead Porcupine Tree reunion",""
"Wilson wouldn't lead Porcupine Tree reunion","Bad headline is bad. This makes it sound like he wouldn't be involved, when he just doesn't want to do all the writing."
"Wilson wouldn't lead Porcupine Tree reunion","Which totally makes sense.  His solo project lineup is fluid, so if he wanted to write for those guys again, he could do it under his name.  There needs to be a reason to go back to PT that makes it more distinct from SW's solo stuff."
"Wilson wouldn't lead Porcupine Tree reunion","I was afraid of this but definitely saw it coming. Wilson looked bored on the last PT shows, and the Incident seemed half-hearted to be totally honest."
"Wilson wouldn't lead Porcupine Tree reunion","Not sure if you read the article but Wilson has always said he is willing to reunite at some point. He just said he wouldn't do all the writing for the next possible record, it would be a band effort."
"Wilson wouldn't lead Porcupine Tree reunion","Wait PT is no longer?"

"The Kindred - Decades","Ill say it like I said last time I saw The Kindred posted. If you get a chance, see them live. Amazing stuff."
"The Kindred - Decades","Saw them live with Protest the Hero, right after they changed their name from Today I Caught the Plague. Awesome live band for sure"
"The Kindred - Decades","Saw them at that tour, too. Mike Ieradi had to play twice, haha."
"The Kindred - Decades","I agree with you completely! These guys blew me away with their live show."
"The Kindred - Decades","This whole album is put together amazingly. The atmosphere never gets off track. Had no idea who these guys were until the PTH tour, but I've been a fan since.

If you're looking to get into the band, Dreambender seems to be the big hit. Everbound, Decades, and Heritage coming in after. "
"The Kindred - Decades","Yeah check out their only album as Today I Caught the Plague. It's called Lore. Same guys, just a name change since they wanted to go in a new direction. That album is also very good progressive metal."
"The Kindred - Decades","I like both albums. I think I like Lore a bit more than their newer stuff, but they're a great band."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream",""
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Stranger Things, what a finisher to an amazing album. Definitely my favorite song of both albums, Spencer killed it."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","And Omega before it. It's the new Racecar."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Omega was a close 2nd! But that emotion and energy in the last line of Stranger Things just blew me away. Omega as a whole is my favored album of the two."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Oh, definitely."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Agreed. That song hits in all the right ways, and Spencer somehow manages to make that last note sound like the end of something huge."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I couldn't agree more."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I've been listening to the two a lot. Omega has my favorite songs overall in the title track and stranger things and hell below but alpha seems to have a better flow to the album. Truly both are masterpieces tho. Periphery has mastered their craft here. 

I keep listening to omega (the song) and I just want to hold the world collective and shout it in their face that THIS is awesome music. But alas no one I know listens to this in Jamaica and I'm sad and lonely :-( lol"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","From the first second you can tell the song is really something special. A song hasn't hooked me like this since Racecar."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Love the whole album aside from Priestess.  Not sure why everyone is getting off to that song so hard.  They seem to think because it is slow and emotional it is totally gr8 and if you don't like it it's just because you want heavy.  But honestly it's just not a very good song.  No cringe worthy moments but still, really boring progression and the song falls very flat and doesn't go anywhere.  It doesn't make sense where it sits on the album and not just because it is a soft song among heavier ones.  The previous song doesn't lead into it in any way and it doesn't go anywhere to connect it to the following song.  Only song on both albums I really don't like in its entirety, and it pretty much is the only reason that Alpha stands out as the better album for me right now.  Pleasantly surprised at how much I like them both as a whole though."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Hell Below is probably the most ridiculously heavy song I have ever heard. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Definitely the heaviest I've heard from Periphery, that's for damn sure."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I could *feel* Hell Below. Jesus that song didn't let up."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Except when it busts into a jazzy piano reprise of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Gotta love that these guys never take themselves too seriously."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Glass Cloud's *Perfect War Forever* is also in Drop Db -but this song is mixed far better. So heavy."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Db... as in two and a half steps below standard Meshuggah tuning?"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Db is only a half step down from drop D, and only 1.5 full steps down from standard tuning.  I don't know what Meshuggah plays in but that's not that low.  BTBAM plays in C# standard which is the same thing, but all the strings are tuned accordingly.  On a 5 string bass that puts your low string at a very floppy G#"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Have you listened to the song? It's the Db *beyond* the one you're talking about.

Edit: If we're talking standard tuning, this is how far below tuning each band goes -

BTBAM - 3 semitones down

Periphery (7-strings) - 8 semitones down

Meshuggah - 10 semitones down

Infant Annihilator - 12 semitones down

Periphery (this song) - 15 semitones down"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I'd only heard the song once at that point and it just seemed so absurdly low to me it didn't seem reasonable haha.  Must have heavy as shit strings on those shits. My bass is solid wood neck built through and btbam tuning makes me go pretty loose on the lower strings even with pretty tight action"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Yeah, he's probably on a 6-string bass for this, and I'm sure his bass is a good as money gets."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","He said he recorded it on a 7 string, so I'm betting he used some kind of octave pedal. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","7-string bass?"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Lol no, guitar"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","At first listen I thought I was listening to Meshuggah, and that's not a bad thing at all"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I thought you were exaggerating, but holy shit. Born Of Osiris sounds like Katy Perry next to this."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","It reminds me of the band [Emmure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4v5F98dmgA). They used to be OK, nowhere near as good as Periphery, though. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Yeah, I can hear that reminder of Emmure too and I'm probably thinking about it a bit too deeply.  Love the track.  I believe it was Misha who said the song is essentially a parody of itself; a song that wouldn't have worked on a PI or PII without the rest of the concept album / vibe to support it.  This style is reminiscent of Emmure's gimmick that got them huge back in the day."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I hope /u/iambulb has some good health insurance. No way imma be able to fix all these new holes I got on my butt after listening to that. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","He's the kind of guy who'll still take you out to dinner after a night like that."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Is anybody else totally blown away by Priestess? I don't think I've ever felt such an emotional vibe from periphery in a song on every level from instrumentation, vocals, lyrics, and just the tone of the song. The album obviously has other stand out tracks, but this one takes the cake for me because it just seems so out of left field for them in my opinion."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I think it shows how versatile they are as musicians. To showcase the heaviness of Hell Below, the length and complexity of Omega, the rhythms of Rainbow Gravity, the riffs of A Black Minute and Heavy Heart, and throw in some jazzy interludes along with the acoustic of Priestess. All of this whilst having a story line with cathartic and impressionable moods and themes. That's pretty fucking special. I don't think I can name an artist besides Periphery that can do that."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","It's really cool. I get an Opethy vibe in certain parts for sure. Great track and album."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","It reminded me of skyharbor in parts. I love it."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","The last minute sounded like Opeth to me"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Near the end of ""Omega"" where Spencer repeats the chorus from ""Alpha"" gives me chills every time. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","That chorus revisit is the most well-crafted reprises. It feels so natural with the song. The only problem is after listening to the song Alpha so many times, I've grown accustomed to that weird time signature in the Alpha chorus."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","See, I am used to it on Alpha as well, but I actually prefer the epic scope and sound of that chorus in Omega more. It has a stronger feeling to me. But to each his own, especially when both are fantastic! "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","God damn. Juggernaut will be the album to beat this year."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Dat bass tone though. Unreal. 

You got sand, Nolly. Boy's got sand!"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","The bass tone... is like. What I've been looking for in music production my whole life lol... Nolly truly deserves ""getgood"" status."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Nolly Isgood."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Nolly GotGood"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Straight up; Nolly should produce an After the Burial album.  The lows are so warm and audible throughout this...  Would be a winning combination of band and producer."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Oh my god, I seriously cannot think of another producer who would be a better match for them. The production of Wolves Within really hurt that album... which is a shame, because the songs on it are absolutely killer. Just imagining ""A Wolf Amongst Ravens"" with a more refined sound and audible bass has my ears tingling."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I'd love a reproduced version of that album. I love a lot of the songs but I end up skipping them in my car because they sound like garbage with zero balls."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Does anybody else cringe when people in this subreddit refer to absolutely anything clean as ""jazzy?"" I don't know what it is, but it seems like how a 5 year old would describe something."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","You're not jazzed about the jazzy?"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Perhaps an issue in other posts, but this album is filled with legit jazz and fusion sections."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I can't remember the entire album right now but which parts are jazz?"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","The end of Hell Below and (I think) Rainbow Gravity.  It's not your traditional jazz (Big band, or combo stuff with the big cats), but something more contemporary-influenced, especially in the chord changes"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I didn't really hear anything truly ""jazzy"" in this album for sure.

Except for maybe the end of Hell Below."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Jazzy for those who havent really heard real jazz. Anyone who falls in the category,  hit me up, we can go to my grandma's house and fire up the jazz mix cds ive made for her."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I'd definitely say that the outro to Hell Below and MX Ultra are very jazz-influenced, though not by traditional jazz, so to speak. Also, the ""alphabet""-part in ""Omega"" - so delicious! "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","The thing I love the most during the song Omega, is the tempo shift during the clean passage at the end of the song.

So good."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","They do occasionally get kind of jazz-fusion during the medium gain moments. I wouldn't call it jazz but you can definitely hear the holdsworth influence on mishas playing. The solo in rainbow gravity off of alpha shows it along with guthrie and petrucci influence all melded into a unique amazing style"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I think it's fair to say there are true jazz sections.  Not something you'd hear from a Davis album, but maybe something you'd hear in contemporary jazz."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I hear what you're saying for sure. My original comment was aimed more at people who hear a clean section in some dj0nttt and call it jazzy. But to your points, I would still say most of it is not jazz. Maybe the part at the end of hell below, but I'm not sure about anything else. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Fair enough.  Also I was wrong about it being Rainbow Gravity.  Its the end interlude of MK Ultra I was thinking of"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Now that I've heard this one in a better sound quality, I have to say the album is a grower, but it grows. I enjoy it and it makes for a nice addition. I don't think Periphery has gone ""concept"" album only and I struggle to imagine them not making a true P3. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Good to see I'm not the only ""grower""."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Another here. They're my favorite band, and I'm gonna be honest, hearing them at first actually disappointed me. I just thought they were alright, but I gave them more time, and this is probably just as good as P2 for me, personally!"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","You seeing them live? I'll be at the Seattle date."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I'm in Atlanta. Saw them last week! They killed it. I see them every time they're in town. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I'm in Atlanta area, too. They put on a damn good show that night. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Those last three songs alone make Omega the clear winner amongst the two albums."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I think this one was better than Juggernaut:Alpha. I didn't lose my interest in any of these songs like I did in the album before; shame it was so short though. This album feels and sounds great. Really a great work of prog."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I wish this had been the longer of the two albums. I was satisfied when alpha ended but was dying for more by the end of omega. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","They are actually both around 40 minutes long. Omega is only 2 minutes shorter than Alpha

"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Yes. I couldn't have said this better myself (which is probably why I didn't say it)."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","They are actually both around 40 minutes long. Omega is only 2 minutes shorter than Alpha"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Right, but I was okay with Alpha ending after 42 minutes (i.e. I liked Omega way better)."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","&gt; Right, but I was okay with Alpha ending after 42 minutes (i.e. **I liked Omega way better**).

Haha well thats why! I totally agree with you though. Omega is better than Alpha
"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Omega is my favorite song from any of Periphery's albums.

Omega the album, is my favorite of the two.

The songs that really stuck with me: Omega, Priestess, Rainbow Gravity, Hell Below, MK Ultra, Four Lights"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Was Omega also your favorite Pokemon remake?"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I feel like I'm the only one who noticed the timing of these two releases. 
Periphery III: Hoenn Confirmed.
"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","The outro to Hell Below sounds like a character select screen on a Mario Kart game.  And I love that"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","This album seems to have more standout songs, more notably the last 2. I wouldn't call the song ""Omega"" the new Racecar, but something very different entirely.

Not to mention Stranger Things; such a soulful song. Both songs sound so Periphery yet not at the same time. I feel that Misha has taken on alot of influence from AAL's Tosin Abasi. Some of the chord progressions in these songs feel very jazzy and unexpected from Periphery. Sure, there was always some jazz-fusion solos and passages (see Racecar) but it feels so much more fleshed out now. The outro to Hell Below sounds straight out of The Contortionist.

So, having listened entirely to both albums now, I can say with certainty that this is my favorite album from them. Seriously can't wait for my preorder to finally arrive.

"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I actually preferred Omega to Racecar. But, they are both tremendous songs. The jazzy passages are so cool, and it's interesting how they follow some of the heavier songs (MK Ultra and Hell Below). These albums are excellent. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I didn't mean that one was better than the other. I love Omega, and I'm sure it will take over Racecar as my favorite song of all time soon enough, but it's delightfully different in many ways. 

I agree about the jazzy outros especially, I enjoyed alot of the electronic interludes in P2, but they felt just a tad bit overdone. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Yeah, I think people are just saying it's the new Racecar because they are awesome songs, that are over 10 minutes. Yeah in regards to P2, I liked it in Have a Blast, but they're a bit much over the course of the whole album. Still a great album though."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Why is this on century media and not Sumerian ?"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Century does their international releases I believe."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I just miss spencer's old vocal layers."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","his singing is terrible. he needs a pop punk band. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","His singing is absolutely not terrible by far. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Ask and you shall receive - Spencer's doing vocals for From First To Last alongside Periphery. [Dead Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW0hcmGP1eI) B)"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","In the past i would strongly disagree with you... but now.."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Just. So good. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","[deleted]"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Is no one gonna address Priestess? I'm absolutely in love with that song. "
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","I liked P2 but I must say Juggernaut is very meh for me, most of the riffs dont sound unique to me and the vocals don't work on any level for me (alpha sounds like..)"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Give it time and repeated listens and that opinion may change. As another poster said, this album is a bit of a 'grower'."
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","Definitely. First few listens the album was super meh for me. Around 4 or 5 listens I was starting to get into it. 

I'm around 11 or 12 by now and I'm seriously loving these records. Alpha is a little more upbeat than previous Periphery stuff at times, but still has plenty of heavy stuff. It really does grow on you. I'm loving it. 

Omega is even better - And holy balls, Hell Below (Heaviest song ever written I'm sure), into Omega ( :O ) then Strange things is the most kick ass ending to a record ever. Spencer KILLS IT so so hard on Strange Things. This is the best stuff they've ever written.

Periphery is love. Periphery is life. ^Now ^if ^only ^the ^Toronto ^Show ^wasn't ^19+ ^so ^I ^could ^go ^:(.

"
"Periphery Juggernaut: Omega Full Album Stream","&gt; Periphery is love. Periphery is life. Now if only the Toronto Show wasn't 19+ so I could go :(.

Yeah its really weird... Not sure why its 19+ because Periphery played the same venue last year and it was all ages... I've been to like 10 concerts at the Opera House and this is the first 19+ i've seen.

If its any consolation, Periphery will probably come back soon (end of 2014) and you should be able to see them then."
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","---

Welcome to week one of /r/progmetal's Album of the Week series. Each week we'll pick a new prog metal (or prog metal-related) album to showcase for the sake of an open, comprehensive subreddit discussion. The albums are all moderator-choices and the order of said albums has been randomized so that there is no discernible pattern. Without further ado:

---

#**Band:** Nokturnal Mortum

#**Album:** The Voice of Steel [(cover art)](http://i.imgur.com/4EJfOV0.jpg)

---

**Released:** December 26, 2009

**Country:** Ukraine

**Flavour:** Black, folk, psychedelic, blues

---

**Why we picked it:** Nokturnal Mortum has spent the majority of their career in relative obscurity playing a brand of synth-heavy black metal. However, with their most recent release, *The Voice of Steel,* they really hit on something different. The album is incredibly difficult to characterize, as it incorporates so many different stylings and influences. At its core, it's black metal that makes use of traditional Ukrainian folk instruments and melodies (see *The Voice of Steel* and *Ukraine*). But to me, this album stands out due to its numerous oddball elements. The dream-like, ethereal, at times psychedelic, soundscapes are one of such examples (see *My Dream Islands* and *White Tower*). One of the most special moments on the disc is probably the bluesy soloing that occurs in the latter half of *Valkyrie,* an absolute standout track. Rather than going on about the little things that make this album special, I'm going to simply say that it's the amalgamation of all of them that makes *The Voice of Steel* a journey. This musical achievement is  something that no one else is really doing, or has done before (at least in this way), and is one of the most progressive things I've heard in years (in an aural sense, rather than technical). If you don't listen to the full thing right now, I will fucking kill you.

"
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","I came into this skeptical, however, there are some nice proggy elements here that set it apart from the black metal bands, and a somewhat of the musical departure from the metal we hear on this forum sometimes.
The symphonic aspect is well done and the concept seems fleshed-out.
I enjoy the rawness of the guitars, doesn't sound like a meticulously designed sound profile imitated through an Axe-Fx.

However, subject matter wise, this is quite controversial. 

BTW, who will be picking album of the week? The only way this works is if it rotates or we should make a weekly drawing to see what user would like to select the album, with some obvious rules (i.e. no one band gets back to back weeks, no recent releases that are spamming the front page anyway) 

Edit:
Ukraine: Enjoy the Gaelic string intro melody. The guitars are incredible, albeit simple, but the harmonic construction on the record is layered perfectly, and with amazing tone. Soaring melody with nice string harmonic back drop. This is a great track. Def. not something for the purists.

"
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","Thank you for keeping an open mind while checking out this album. The purpose of a good chunk of our AotW choices are to broaden the horizons of our subscribers and challenge their notions of prog metal. 

I have personally already catalogued all of the albums that are to account for a over year's worth of AotWs. Expect to see a fairly eclectic variety that again, will not have any discernible pattern in regards to order (because there isn't one; the list has been randomized by a script). No one band will ever have more than one of their albums featured, at least for the first year we run this. As well, AotW will generally not feature new releases, as that's not its purpose. "
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","Thanks for starting up the album of the week again! I'll be sure to give it a listen when I get home!"
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","No problem! And update us when you've heard it. "
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","This is really, really good. I'm typically not very big on Black Metal, but this was very well done. I could definitely listen to more stuff like this. Is their newest album a similar style?"
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","I like how these guys are trying to add something new to the genre. We've all heard the typical ""listen to this trem riff"" blackmetal band.

Sidenote; I really wish black metal didn't have such a lo-fi aesthetic attached to it's recording production. It's a shame that a lot of this music can often be overlooked by outsiders simply because the record sounds like an amateur demo. I get the harshness of the sound ""adds to the aggression"" or whatever but you can be just as aggressive and not sound like a garage band. /endminirant"
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","As happy as I am that we're getting weekly discussions back, I don't think these guys deserve any attention, since their vocalist is an outspoken racist. Will still give the album a listen though."
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","If it's good music, it gets featured. Extrapolitical issues do not affect this.

However, it's probably still worth noting that (in an albeit very vague post), the singer recounted on his views in 2014. https://www.facebook.com/nokturnalmortumofficial/posts/10154629159940487"
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","Hmm, I had never seen this before. Thanks for showing me this."
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","You're welcome."
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","Nice concept for a black metal band"
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","Yes. It's something that black metal purists will reject, but also something that doesn't really have a concrete place in any other music circle. Which is why I love this album so much. "
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","And too think that I don't like the whole genre of black metal as a whole (it's too harsh for my ears) but the fantasy-sque lyrics are good.

After all , most dark/black metal bands sing about Tolkien right?"
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","Nope, that would be Satan. "
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","Oh.

Are there some black metal bands who sing ln a clean voice and sing about non-satan themes?"
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","Sorry, yes there are many that are not Satanic, I was just being snarky. Most of the Satanic bands are the Norwegian ones that emerged in the early to mid nineties, and even then many of them were doing it just for show, not out of legitimate belief. 

As far as clean singing goes, harsh vocals are a requirement for something to be considered black metal, as far as I'm concerned. You'll find some bands that combine harsh and cleans but as far as I'm aware, you'll find none that only have cleans. "
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","Thanks"
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","You're welcome, Phillip. "
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","I was only vaguely aware of Nokturnal Mortum, mostly due to their very questionable political leanings (although it seems they somewhat grew out of it). I never actually listened to any of their music before.

Voice of Steel is an excellent album, no doubt. It reminds me a quite a bit of the more experimental USBM bands like Wolves In The Throne Room, Krallice or Panopticon, perhaps Nachtmystium, but the combination of folk elements and Floydian soundscapes is still very unique.

Favourite track: White Tower. I just hope it's not a song about white supremacism.
"
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","I've only recently been really getting into black metal ( I crept in through Enslaved's discography in reverse order). I enjoyed this album way more than I was expecting. I'm not as eloquent at describing music or how I react to it as other users but I would love to keep these albums of the week going.

How are you guys planning on choosing which album to present?"
"/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)","Nice to see you're not going with an obvious pick, I would've never guessed this would ever be an album of the week here. It's not really an album you would really call progressive metal, but I think it certainly is progressive, so it fits, and it's something completely different than the usual music posted here, which is good.

Anyway, this is a really great, and also a really fun album. I absolutely love the juxtaposition of the thundering rhythm of the guitar and bass guitar, and the more light-hearted keyboards and folk instruments on top of that. And just like with the instruments the switching between harsh and clean vocals works really well too, it keeps the music varied and it keeps me engaged. Whereas lots of black metal is very rhythm-based, and tries to invoke a hypnotic sound, here the folk melodies add a whole new dimension to it, and makes it a lot more accessible and fun to listen to. Whenever I listen to the album I routinely catch myself humming along with the melodies, which hardly ever happens with black metal. I haven't really followed the band since the release of this album, but I do sure hope they're still active (metal-archives says they are), and are making new music, because I'm dying to hear where they go from here."
"The Afterimage - The Unseen",""
"The Afterimage - The Unseen","Their EP Lumiere is coming out this year! So pumped for it."
"The Afterimage - The Unseen","EP? I NEED A GODDAMN ALBUM! Seriously, I love these guys."
"The Afterimage - The Unseen","I think they said they are in the process of making a full-length that follows the EP too."
"The Afterimage - The Unseen","In the event that you're a guitar player, this is a perfect tab of the song: http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/t/the_afterimage/the_unseen_guitar_pro.htm

Without bothering to search, I'll assume one of the band members tabbed it out."
"Scale The Summit - Atlas Novus",""
"Scale The Summit - Atlas Novus","While I love the intro on this track as much as the next guy, I really think the section [2:28-2:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0kUpcCSzn8&amp;t=148) is the highlight of the song (and possibly the entire album) for me.  Its just so beautiful."
"Scale The Summit - Atlas Novus","For me, [The Great Plains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-9zmGNb-Gk) is the ultimate STS song"
"Scale The Summit - Atlas Novus","Underrated band, and underrated album IMO. "
"Scale The Summit - Atlas Novus","One of my favorites of all time. Also, they put on one of the most enthralling live shows I've ever seen."
"Scale The Summit - Atlas Novus","Damn I love this song. So much tasty tapping. "
"Scale The Summit - Atlas Novus","Fuck I love this band. "
"Scale The Summit - Atlas Novus","Probably my favorite Scale the Summit song, also the song that got me into them. Just a great album."
"Scale The Summit - Atlas Novus","One of my favorite bands, and one of my favorite songs by them. Love these guys. Still waiting to get a 6 string to finish learning to play this."
"Scale The Summit - Atlas Novus","The bass on this album is some of my favorite shit to both listen to and play.  Mark Michell was a great choice as their new bassist, fits the band perfectly and brings just enough new flavor from what Jordan (also fantastic) was doing."
"Scale The Summit - Atlas Novus","This came on shuffle this morning. Put me in the best of moods. :) "
"Scale The Summit - Atlas Novus","Way overrated band. Still like a couple songs, but way overrated."
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt",""
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","Born in Winter is my favorite off this album. Completely different from anything else I've heard from them, and I guess the most ""prog metal-ly"" song on the album.  

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suG-c_i2fBQ) for those who haven't heard it. Wait for the metalz, it happens, don't worry. "
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","The entire album is pretty rad, Born in Winter is no exception!"
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","I completely agree with you. Born in Winter is by far my post played song from this album. His voice, the atmosphere, the mood changes, they all form a really beautiful song."
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","Same here. I prefer FMTS and TWOAF over L'Enfant Sauvage, but this song alone is one of my favorite Gojira songs overall."
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","FMTS is one of the best albums of the new millennium IMO.  "
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","I hope they play it live soon."
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","definitely my favorite song off the last album. the guitar during the verses is awesome"
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","That got me hooked to the song as well. Not to take away from the tapping, but the verse riff is badass. "
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","The verses are so heavy and the change around 1:45 is really fun to play on drums. I can only consistently/cleanly play the blasts in this song at 95% tempo though:( 


Really been digging Gojira lately, just need a few more listens on their earlier LPs


EDIT:
Woops I was listening to All the Tears when I wrote this comment. lol...
I was referring to The Gift of Guilt with the heavy verses though."
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","Aw yeah, Gojira that I haven't heard"
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","Go listen to the whole ""L'Enfant Sauvage"" album, it's really worth it."
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","I feel like an idiot now because I really like the first song on the album (Explosia) but I haven't gotten around to listening to the rest for some reason."
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","L'enfant Sauvage is incredibly good. I'd definitely recommend a listen(or more), if you haven't heard it before."
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","I did the same thing. I had this album for a year before I made it past the first song on this album and realized how good it was. "
"Gojira - The Gift of Guilt","i agree. this album is amazing"
"Breacher - Offerings To Lugus",""
"Age restrictions at shows","A friend and I have been superhyped about going to see Devin and Periphery blow the roof of at a show in Stockholm this month. It just couldn't get better, Devin AND Periphery! 

Anyways, I go to book our tickets when in horror I see this text: Åldersgräns 18 år. 

My dreams were crushed. I wouldn't be able to see the 2 bands that were hyped the most. 

With a heart impaled and tears in my face I accepted my fate and fell down in the lonely abyss below. 

TL;DR it sucks to be 17."
"Age restrictions at shows","I have a love hate relationship with the concept of 18+ shows. 

On one hand I understand that most of the time it's the venue that stipulates it's 18+ due to their liqueur licences (at least that's why here in Australia) and it sucks to know that there are fans who don't get the opportunity to see their favourite bands play because they're not of age. I missed the chance to see Porcupine Tree tour here for this exact reason.

On the other hand, every single all ages show I've been too has been full of the most disrespectful crowd members. Yelling at the artists, talking during songs, picking fights, you name it. So I will always attend the 18+ shows if given the choice to avoid that behavior. "
"Age restrictions at shows","I've never been to a show with problems with the crowd. Everyone have always been happy and you always seem to find new nice people at the shows. This may just be the case for shows in general here in Sweden as the metal culture is more than established here and everyone is there to have fun. 

The liqueur license thing is probably the reason it's 18+ (nice to know Sweden and Australia has something in common) and I know that. Still sucks but I guess I'll have to accept it. "
"Age restrictions at shows","Ahhh the culture thing could definitely be it. 

One thing I've noticed here is that they'll put a more ""age appropriate"" opening act on before a bigger band at an all ages show to fill the room. Generally it's some semi-popular core band that gets the crowd all rowdy.

"
"Age restrictions at shows","Try calling the venue and ask what kinda id you'll need. I was at a show that was 15+ a few weeks ago. But to of my younger friends were going who are both 14 .they called ahead and the venue pretty much said that if they looked it they'd let em in. "
"Age restrictions at shows","Dude I feel. Red Fang and Opeth within a day of each other here, just months before my 18th, as well as many other tours including Enter Shikari, Suffocation + Decapitated, Architects, Psycroptic + Disentomb and sleepmakeswaves all before my 18th too. If Periphery or Devin Townsend do this to me I will probably cry."
"Age restrictions at shows","I spy an Australian.

Devin Townsend and Periphery toured here last year so you'll have to wait a bit ;)"
"Age restrictions at shows","You got me, I'm Australian. I'll try to hide my goon and thongs better next time we guess the nationalities around here. Hopefully Periphery include Perth in the dates this time, and as long as its after the start of August I'd be able to go. Fingers crossed."
"Age restrictions at shows","I cried when they didn't tour WA "
"Age restrictions at shows","Yeah, I've had some similar occurrences. However, because of the US alcohol laws, it's 21 + over, further elongated my attempt to see a few shows. I missed the Winery Dogs when they came to Seattle :/"
"Age restrictions at shows","just go anyway and give it a shot.  "
"Age restrictions at shows","In my economical situation that's not really an option. And I have a babyface so I don't look a day over 15..."
"Age restrictions at shows","as in you can't afford to go? that's a different story.  Like I said, I'd try to go anyway, who knows...."
"Age restrictions at shows","I can't put €30 on tickets and then get denied entrance. That's a third of my monthly income and I need it for other things if I can't see the show. "
"The Dear Hunter - The Bitter Suite [6:07]",""
"The Dear Hunter - The Bitter Suite [6:07]","I'm giving you an upvote because I clicked the link and I really liked it. They're a band I've been meaning to check out for a while and I'm very impressed. However, by no stretch of the imagination would I consider this metal."
"The Dear Hunter - The Bitter Suite [6:07]","Part of the reason I love this sub is that we *can* post some stuff outside of metal as long as it's halfway relevant. All the other music subs take themselves way too seriously."
"The Dear Hunter - The Bitter Suite [6:07]","&gt; A place to discuss music and anything else related to progressive metal.

From the sidebar. Most people would not consider Porcupine Tree or Steven Wilson ""metal"", but they're still posted and discussed here because there's a huge overlap between their fans and fans of ""prog metal"". If it appeals to the majority of the sub's user base while still being at least tangentially related, I think it definitely has a place here."
"The Dear Hunter - The Bitter Suite [6:07]","Right on the nose."
"The Dear Hunter - The Bitter Suite [6:07]","[deleted]"
"The Dear Hunter - The Bitter Suite [6:07]","Agreed! Also your flair is super awesome. 


So I had never really listened to these guys before now and I have to say I'm loving what I just heard. Couldn't help but think of BTBAM during that quirky swing kind of mid section that happens right after the sweeping chorus. Really original sound. Thanks for sharing, OP! "
"The Dear Hunter - The Bitter Suite [6:07]","You might enjoy 'The Color Spectrum' - that album was my first Dear Hunter experience and it absolutely blew me away. It's a really diverse set of songs, grouped by ""color"", that span multiple genres (the songwriting is out of this world). Fair warning though, it's 2.5 hours so prepare for a long journey hahah.

"The Dear Hunter - The Bitter Suite [6:07]","Their songs do vary quite a bit. They tend to be more rock than metal. One of their songs a bit closer to metal would be [In Cauda Venenum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je0iLECqtAA), but that's been posted here before. "
"The Dear Hunter - The Bitter Suite [6:07]","They definitely have some music that gets fairly heavy. "
"The Dear Hunter - The Bitter Suite [6:07]","&gt;However, by no stretch of the imagination would I consider this metal.

People need to lighten up about this, and it's not just this sub. The fact of the matter is that many genres overlap and present qualities that line up well with those we enjoy in ours. I find that I most appreciate these subs during posts like this, where someone introduces something outside our box into the mix, with an understanding of what it is about music in general we like. I guess some people hate fun but still..."
"The Dear Hunter - The Bitter Suite [6:07]","By no means do I hate fun, generally speaking I have no qualms with these kinds of posts, after all I did just find a band I have just become a little bit obsessed with because of one. But I guess I pointed it out, because, errrr, I dunno, it wasn't keeping with the theme of the sub? Could be a good idea to list non-metal suggestions under a separate flair though?"
"The Dear Hunter - The Bitter Suite [6:07]","&gt;Could be a good idea to list non-metal suggestions under a separate flair though?

I think this is a great idea. There should *definitely* be a flair for what amount to musical cross-posts. "

"[Buckethead] Thanatopsis - Axiology on vinyl","**Travis Dickerson**:

&gt;I would love to repress Axiology. However, there is just no demand for it. No one is buying CDs anymore. I wanted to do it for the 10th year anniversary
but it really makes no economic sense.  So it's not looking good. Thanatopsis first CD is about to go out of print as well.  I have been toying with doing a short run of Axiology on vinyl but the retail price would be around $25. Not sure of the interest there either. It's looking like we have passed the CD singularity and will now be ( in best Steven Hawking voice) stretched into spaghetti.

&gt;I've added a [poll](http://www.tdrsmusic.com/forum2/index.php?topic=2866.0) just to get some idea of demand before I commit to anything.
I don't want to pre-sell anything because the last time I did we came way short and I'm still out of pocket on the repress I did anyway. Also, I don't want to collect money and have to refund 30 or 40 transactions. I would need  75 to 100 people say they would commit, then I would need 75 to actually pre-buy a repress. I really don't think there is anywhere close to that demand but for the sake of those that are encouraging me and would like to see something happen, I'll at least explore the idea.

&gt;If there is an interest in vinyl, It would probably be a pressing of 200 only as a commemoration of Axiology's 10th anniversary. I would probably remix it to tape and remaster for vinyl and do a 180 gram pressing. I might sign and number the editions sold to the pre-sale buyer, something like that.

&gt;The poll above has an option to just repress the CD, that might be the most practical option for most people who want to actually listen to the record, but I just don't know. I think most people who are interested in Thanatopsis have the CD, but i may be surprised, let's see."

"Tool: Hooker With A Penis. Heavy as fuck and funny as hell.","Lateralus and 10000 Days are catchier albums so they may be the best starting point, specifically the songs Lateralus, Schism, The Grudge, The Pot maybe too.

Ænima and Undertow are both darker and more evil, but they're both fantastic in their own right. Ænima is probably their best album so if you like what you hear I'd say just listen to that full through to really enjoy them. "
"Tool: Hooker With A Penis. Heavy as fuck and funny as hell.","So like basically anywhere haha :) "
"Tool: Hooker With A Penis. Heavy as fuck and funny as hell.","I'd start with the Aenima album myself. It gives you a good idea of what they're about. Stinkfist, Aenima, 46&amp;2 are good entry level tool songs."
"Tool: Hooker With A Penis. Heavy as fuck and funny as hell.","Tool has significantly changed over the years. Each album seems to get more and more complicated both rhythmically and acoustically. I'd start at the beginning and work your way from there. Opiate, Undertow, Aenima, Lateralus, 10,000 Days. Their first hits were [Hush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF_WKwbueG8) and [Opiate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt0Zqo-vOFM) and are both a great way to get a sense of what this band is about. Undertow is a brilliant album (may be my favorite) with [Flood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cNR2Td2lIE) being one of the epics. It starts slow but the payoff is well worth it. I'll let you discover the rest. Enjoy.

"Periphery - Stranger Things, what a closer","And the high and long note shortly after that... Spencer really nailed the vocals on Juggernaut in my opinion."
"Periphery - Stranger Things, what a closer","Spencer wrecked the vocals, it's insane. It legit makes me angry when people say he's terrible or he got worse since P1 cause he's done nothing but improve tremendously, lol. You don't have to like his vocals, but to say he's bad is just straight wrong. "
"Periphery - Stranger Things, what a closer","Here's my opinion, I think Spencer has an amazing voice, one of the best I've ever heard. It's his *singing* that can really piss me off sometimes, perhaps irrationally, but this is all subjective.

His cleans on Omega (the song) and Stranger Things are great because he doesn't add that annoying flair to the singing like he does on much of Alpha (the album).

His harsh vocals are right up there with my favorites, and I really respect how he can whip out like six or seven different screams, growls, what have you."
"Periphery - Stranger Things, what a closer","Yeah, I can see where you're coming from with not liking his ""flairiness"", or what have you. It's a bit much for this genre of music at times, but it usually doesn't bother me that much. In either case though and you seem to agree, his cleans aren't inherently *bad* by any means."

"Periphery - Stranger Things, what a closer","[deleted]"
"Periphery - Stranger Things, what a closer","I thought he's improved drastically so far. Although, I think his style is pretty poppy I absolutely think he's a terrific vocalist. The hate he gets is nature warranted for that reason, but I do not think it takes away from his vocals. It's his nature and I think he's awesome. "
"Periphery - Stranger Things, what a closer","Exactly this, yeah. The guy has some serious talent and creativity with his voice, from plain menacing shouts, and cleans that seem to turn harsh for a single word throughout the lyric.
The only thing I don't like is the occasional nasally quality his voice takes in some songs, most noticeably in Heavy Heart."
"Periphery - Stranger Things, what a closer","I find it just downright ignorant to say he's a bad vocalist. People on MetalSucks say this all the time and I just think ""how in the actual fuck can you objectively say something like that?"" "
"Periphery - Stranger Things, what a closer","Had a guy on Facebook tell me he thought MK Ultra was a bad song because he had a couple of really shallow reasons to not like Spencer's vocals/vocals are bad. I was like. Dude. Come on. "
"Periphery - Stranger Things, what a closer","Yeah that sums up MetalSucks.net commenters. What it boils down to is basically just ""that's like, your opinion man."" You can not like the guy's style of vocals, you can even not like the band. But to say that there's a member in Periphery who isn't talented is just plain ignorance. Those people make my blood boil. "
"Periphery - Stranger Things, what a closer","I thought the same. Exact. Thing. "
"Periphery - Stranger Things, what a closer","It rivals The Last Baron and White Walls in terms of closers, and I don't say that lightly. "

"Mastodon - The Motherload","Unfortunately with the way Mastodon usually uses their vocals in the context of Albums, especially Brent, it seems like it's almost impossible to replicate. It seems as though they really struggle with vocals on live performances. "

"Mastodon - The Motherload","I agree. But when it comes to horrifically out of tune vocals what else can I say? Don't see people attempting riffs that are impossible for them. "
"Mastodon - The Motherload","Actually for a while that's how Protest the Hero was writing some of their gnarlier riffs. The only difference is that eventually they learned how to play the riffs."
"Mastodon - The Motherload","Yeah. I do the same and a lot of people do. But they the learn how to do it properly before showcasing it. "
"Mastodon - The Motherload","I tend to go easy on musicians who are doing extended tours. Singing like that night after night is exhausting (I speak from experience) and, yeah putting on a great show is important, but i sympathize with why one night might be rougher than the others."
"Mastodon - The Motherload","Very true. But I saw them before their touring cycle had begun. I though it was just a case of not being used to playing it live but I guess not. I really wanted this album to push mastodon towards being European festival headliners in a few years to come but I feel this won't happen now. "

Would you be interested in a very casual collaboration project? I'm a pianist and have a couple of completed drafts that I would like to turn into se very tasty progmetal.

I don't have access to a real piano, as a Casio Privia is the best I could do for the moment, but I'll be getting higher quality instrument packs when the time is right. Here are two samples with plenty of room for guitars, drums and vocals.

This sounds pretty relevant to the Juggernaut Alpha cover with the birthing rite involving blood. Possibly Scarlet and the blood spilled by those observing the birthing rite are synonymous? "
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Yeah, alot of lyrics seem to fit in well. ""slave thats born in a dark world of disease"". to ""selfish lies, i'm diseased"" from Stranger Things. Also, ""scarlet robes and sadistic minds surround me"" from Heavy Heart."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","My mind is blowing so much linking the lyrics of Scarlet to this concept, holy shit."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","There's a theory explained in the comment section. Thanks to ""InLovingMemoryOfficial"" for the posible meaning behind this awesome (and funny) clip:
""It looks like the video game grants him the ability to view past memories/troubles.  His life seems to be displayed linearly on the street with all the identical houses, each one representing a different time in his life. As he moves from house to house, he views different negative memories and mistakes, progressively moving forward in time.  He eventually reaches present day, where his virtual self meets with his real life self.  Some crazy stuff happens and he now seems to be able to go back and fix everything that went wrong (catching the trophy before it breaks, not flipping out on his parents, not driving drunk).  then at the end i guess he sort of just comes to and realizes what happened? any other thoughts?﻿"""
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Um yeah all that explained was the obvious parts... "
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","well the game he is playing is called rainbow gravity, which is a theory on how the universe came to be.  The game is a lot like the theory in the way it plays."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Lol, Scarlet video playing on the TV at the house party. Then the mustard ship at the end was great!

I'm beginning to believe Scarlet is apart of the concept of Juggernaut. "
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Apart or a part?"
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Lol, good question. Hard to say."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","The fact that he mentions scarlet in like 3 juggernaut songs helps."

"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Thanks"
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","This sucks so hard."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Seriously, The song structure is so bland compared to what these guys have come out with in the past. The song pacing is so boring too, its basically verse-chorus-verse-chorus-instrumental break-chorus-hur dur breaks etc. Plus it sticks in 4/4 the entire time so I don't get how this could be considered prog. I really don't get why everyone still has such a huge hard on for this band"
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","&gt; I really don't get why everyone still has such a huge hard on for this band

Because taste is subjective. 

You can croon all you like about how think people only like them because they're the 'in' thing but most people are just going to look at you and not give a flying fuck over your opinion, because that's all it is, an opinion. 

I could say the exact same thing, wondering why people get such a hard on for ripping on an obviously popular band, because you want to know what IS objective? Success. 

Ripping on a band because they're successful just makes you look like a fucking prick, especially finding threads that are quite obviously in support of said band.  I suppose you can go start your own thread saying how much you hate the album, but don't be surprised if you get literally no response except from people who want to join you in your echo chamber. 

But hey,  what do I know,  I like periphery and i'm a big fan, so not like you're going to give a fuck about my wall of text either, but I don't care. 

I just wanted to waste 5 minutes typing out a rather long and drawn out 'fuck you.'"
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Don't worry. If you read what he said, you'll realize that he probably didn't even listen to the song cause it's literally all incorrect."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","I like their unique aspects but i don't like the fall out boy style of singing."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","What I was getting at was that it's ok to dislike a band, it's subjective.

What I have beef with though is people deliberately posting trash talk in threads that quite obviously support the band in question.

I could sit in an emo or punk subreddit all day and post about how much I hate punk, but that's both a waste of my time and only serves to make me look like a prick with a superiority complex.

tl;dr you can dislike a band, but the people that do like a band don't really care for you gassing about hating them."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","I actually agree with his criticism. Not that I can't still enjoy what they offer."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Definitely not 4/4 the entire time, makes me think you didn't even listen to it. The last half alternates between 7/4 and 8/4. The chorus alternates between 8/4 and 7/4. 

Your layout of ""verse chorus verse chorus instrumental chorus hur dur"" doesn't even take into account the last half of the song. It's okay to not like the band, but your literally wrong with everything you said. Not the opinion part, but the facts.

edit: Even the verses aren't entirely in 4/4. They cut a beat out before the ""wanting what you never have"" parts."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Periphery only plays in 4/4. Ask misha."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Anything can be 4/4 if you count whacky enough."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Pretty much the summary of Meshuggah's career"
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","""Oh no, they're just 27th notes, I promise."""
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","'Just slap some drums on top, add a backbeat, call it a day' 

4/4 would compose again. "
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Not ALWAYS but frequently I'd estimate."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Periphery doesn't play only in 4/4, but mostly yeah"
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Captain On is not in 4/4, and is one of the smoothest odd time signatures you will hear. Other songs have much more obvious sections that are not 4/4. The 7/8 solo section in Have a Blast, for example. "
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Captain on is very much in 4/4 dude. Sections may ""sound"" like the time signatures are changing, but that's what periphery does. I'm listening to captain on right now. 1-2-3-4. 1-2-3-4."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","[deleted]"
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Go back to the beginning and count with me when the rhythm section comes in. It's 5(2+3)+4+4. Or 5/8+8/8. It changes to 4/4 at the breakdown around 1 minute, and then switches back. 

It may sound like 4/4 to you because it's very smooth, but it's actually 13/8. You just gotta count."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Sorry dude. Misha wrote it. He says it's in 4/4. Count the drums. "
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","/u/iambulb want to shed some light for us?"
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","The drums aren't in 4/4 either, there is no 4/4 backbeat anywhere. I'm not sure what you're counting but the only time that song is in 4/4 is the breakdown. The rest is 13/8. If you count the drums they pretty clearly outline this. "
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","I'm beginning to think, due to your username and insistence on strangely incorrect info, that you're a troll account. In which case, you're doing a pretty good job! 6/6, would get mildly frustrated reading your comments again."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Nice try deflecting. But you're not more correct then the person who wrote the music. Sorry."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Oh, most of the second section of 'Alpha' is not in 4/4 and is in a sort of half time, or 'straight' 7/8.  They also use this throughout the first half of the track as a cool little tag in the verse when the drums go into half time.  There are probably more examples on Juggernaut as well, but I've only listened to it twice.

I definitely agree that Periphery mostly write in 4/4 and are known for utilizing a 4/4 pulse over oddly timed riffs, but to say that they only write in 4/4 is ridiculous and there are a number of examples of them using odd times."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Exactly my thoughts. PI was okay I guess, a few songs were really great but as a whole, not so much. PII was great as a whole, but no song really stood out. Now they've gone full pop-whore."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Yeah... This album is far less prog than P2. Such a shame"
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","I disagree and would say that this is the most progressive album they've made. Re-occuring themes and riffs extending over the course of an 80 minute album, including an 11 minute Omega that goes through at least 3 separate phases. The album still maintains syncopated rhythms, time signature changes and theoretically complex music, cornerstones of progressive metal. Whilst P1 and P2 had the latter they had nothing like the extensive overarching picture that *Juggernaut* which is a huge progressive feature in itself."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","song structure is too formulaic tho."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","You need to go back to P2 and double check those structures, tho.

**Songs with Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus**

Facepalm Mute

Scarlet

Make Total Destroy (plus a pre-bridge, I s'pose)

Erised (plus epilogue extension)


There's *plenty* of simple-structured songs on Periphery's back catalog, Icarus Lives + Jetpacks + All New Materials + Captain On.

Perhaps *more importantly*, complicated song structures is just ONE possible element of progressive music. Yes, Language by The Contortionist is amazing in its elaborate song layout, but Animals as Leaders' Joy of Motion doesn't have a ton of complicated structures to the songs, yet no one is denying that it's progressive music. Plenty of other elements of the albums are amazingly complex."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Captain On is so weird but so good, considering it's only 1 riff"
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Each to their own. I'd agree looking at the songs separately it's not the proggiest but if every song was proggy on the record it would end up being incredibly tiresome to listen to. Not to mention with the storyline how disjointed the album as a whole would feel."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","I honestly don't understand why they are so popular - every time I try listening to Periphery, they sound like all of the other generic emo-core bands out there. Whats their distinction? How are they different? "
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","It's because they're complicated without being obnoxious about it. Listen to something like [Captain On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkaUUzugdY), which feels so smooth and even despite the fact that it's in 13. You don't even notice.

The music is accessible to a casual listen, but stands up in complexity to intense scrutiny. Spencer is admittedly a divisive aspect to the band, but it is impressive that he manages to figure out catchy (or 'poppy', for people who insist on using that term as if it's something derogatory) melodies to go over strange chord progressions, atypical meters, and angular riffs.

Is it as immediately noticeably complex as BTBAM or The Contortionist or TYS or PtH? No, because usually there's a quarter note pulse somewhere that you can latch on to and bob your head to, so it seems 'simple'. And that single layer is indeed simple, hence the accessibility to casual listeners. But there's a ton of crazy shit going on with every other layer."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","A bit late to the party on this, but I have been a HUGE fan of Periphery II and the Clear EP and did not notice how frequently they are outside of 4/4 until I started listening to A/O. I can't stop spinning A/O, there's just so much amazing instrumentals coupled with great vocal hooks. Anyways, I totally agree with everything that you just said and have only realized it lately."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","This is probably one of the most ""poppy"" songs they made. They have loads of heavier  and proggier stuff. Check out the song Omega and tell me they're just another emo band. "
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","I don't know... I've done that, and even saw them live a couple of times. They just seem like the Katy Perry of Death/Metalcore to me."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Dude they're just a poor man's between the buried and me, everyone is just riding the hype train it's bound to stop soon.

Edit: words."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","*they're

*man's

*it's

And they're quite different from BTBAM, comparing bands that are very dissimilar just because they're in the same genre is silly. Is BTBAM a poor man's Tool? No, that's apples and oranges, silly comparison, as is this one."
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","No Tool and Between The Buried and Me would be some what of a silly comparison to some extent, but you could compare them. That's why we have the yearly top album of the year. It would be red apple to green apple. "
"Periphery - Alpha (Official Music Video)","Listen to MK Ultra or Hell Below. I'm not sure where you're getting an emo vibe but I can assure you those songs will kill it."

"Artists similar to Chris Letchford's solo album?","Oh dude, don't even get me started! Listening to everyone speak about what their vision of the group is and watching them take on new tunes for the first time is so insightful. I've been obsessed with Ultrahang for the past three or four years so when I saw the trailer for this way back in 2011, I freaked out. It made it's way online briefly in 2012 and then was taken down, finally being made available in 2013. I just wish I could purchase it on DVD."
"Artists similar to Chris Letchford's solo album?","I love his album! I really live Scale the Summit though. I hope they're planning on releasing new material soon."

"Artists similar to Chris Letchford's solo album?","Yeah I've been a fan for a long time ! I didn't know there was any connection to StS though. Thanks for the suggestion!"
"Artists similar to Chris Letchford's solo album?","Sometimes he gets a little flack for some of his writing, but I adore most of Pat Metheny's output, he writes such fantastic chord progressions, always goes places you wouldn't expect, but sound really smooth. He's got sort of a progjazz/fusion group that plays wonderful wonderful music.  

Hell, you want to talk prog, probably my favorite thing the Pat Metheny Group has done is this 5 part singular composition called The Way Up, and all told it's about an hour piece. Recurring motives, cool grooves and meters, and a ton of different textures. The way it's written, it's hard to tell where the structured material ends and the improvisation begins. You can watch/listen to it [live in South Korea!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4JJbY4Qv6c)"

"Noise prog?","So I'm a big fan of both noisy rock music (mostly shoegaze/noise rock) and prog so I'm wondering if there's any prog rock/metal around with a more dirty/lo-fi-ish sound. Any recommendations are appreciated!"
"Noise prog?","Steven Wilson's album Insurgentes has a fair bit.

"Noise prog?","Travel Now Journey Infinitely by Trinacria was a one-off side-project from members of Enslaved and a Noise Rock band called Fe-mail. It sounds just like you would expect.

Sadly, besides the brilliant [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwKI_ozpKI4), it's mostly just an average album and never quite lives up to its potential - despite the unique sound."

"Noise prog?","This is one of my biggest musical interests for the moment. I love songs like ""Aly,Walk With Me"" by The Ravenettes where there is a good 10-15 seconds of some beautiful, dissonant feedback, but I've yet to find a good metal band that literally uses noise and feedback artfully rather than just turning up the gain on their amps. "

"Dir en Grey - Vinushka","I haven't listened to these guys since Withering to Death and now I feel a need to go download a shitload of their music again. "
"Dir en Grey - Vinushka","Love these guys, I got into them at the height of my weeaboo phase and they're one of the few things still left over from that time.  Awesome band."
"Dir en Grey - Vinushka","Dude! Same here! I had a huge weeaboo phase too, but this band has prevailed."
"Dir en Grey - Vinushka","I totally love this band. Have only found the time to listen to Uroboros and Dum Spiro Spero (which are now amoing my favorite albums), but I'm excited like a child for their new album Arche. Amazon take their time to ship it here...

Just yesterday I've listened to the Uroboros live album for the first time. My god was that an awesome performance!"
"Dir en Grey - Vinushka","They are also a good band to listen to while studying, if you can't understand Japanese. Still a fantastic band. "
"Difference between the terms ""experimental"" and ""progressive""?","I've heard these terms many times, sometimes interchangeably, and they seem to refer largely to a certain genre of music. However, I'm still somewhat unsure how to define each term or how to describe them to people who are unfamiliar with them. Also is there a difference between the two? Thanks!"
"Difference between the terms ""experimental"" and ""progressive""?","Experimental consists in throwing the rule book out the window whereas prog is sticking to the parts of the rule book most rock/metal bands tend to never even scratch. Really, Experimental is very meticulous about how they craft the song to get to that idea they have in mind and nothing is off limits, even the song itself is secondary (meaning, they care little if it is comprehensible to others), whereas Prog is more about meticulously crafting the song, with the idea of it only slightly influencing the final product and the final product needing to be something the fans would expect/what will sell. 

 Rarely are either actually progressive (in the strong sense of the word, as in, it's definition). However, more progress tends to come from Experimental groups than in Progressive groups. 
"
"Difference between the terms ""experimental"" and ""progressive""?","I think prog metal tends toward elegance and epicness, incorporating other styles and ideas into something that is generally well polished, refined and ambitious. Dream Theater, Opeth, Porcupine Tree, Mastodon are good examples. The reddit alien drawing at the top of the subreddit is a good caricature of this style.

Experimental metal also incorporates other styles and ideas but they are often less congruent and more chaotic/random (Unexpect, Dog Fashion Disco, Diablo Swing Orchestra, geez these names really say it all), or it can sometimes actually strip metal down to a more basic form that tends to have a narrower appeal (Meshuggah, Lightning Bolt)."
"Difference between the terms ""experimental"" and ""progressive""?","I'd say that progressive generally has a more progressive character to it. The use of chord progressions in a rather more progressive way in order to progress a song is a common feature in progressive music.

Experimental music has more... experiments. The bands experiment with certain experimental ideas in order to experiment on their sound and produce experimental music.

Joking aside, they're just random words when used without a context. For instance, progressive trance and progressive house are not ""progressive"" in the same way that prog. rock or prog. metal are. Experimental music, well, you could say that noise music is experimental, but then again there's a genre called noise music. You could call free jazz experimental, but there's a whole lot of free jazz, some of it waaaay wackier than other free jazz. In terms of metal and rock progressive usually means the song's structure, harmony, rhythm are arbitrarily more ""complex"" than a ""non-progressive rock/metal"" song. Experimental stuff can push these features even further (Unexpect, for example) or taking an ""anything goes"" approach (Mr. Bungle might be a good example).

There's also 20th century classical music and if you're into experimental and weird sounding stuff, it's the biggest jackpot ever and it'll probably make you question quite a bit just how ""experimental"" modern bands are. Then again, you could compare common practice period music (baroque, classical, romantic) and prog. rock/metal, and while it's a totally unfair and (largely) unnecessary comparison, in purely technical terms prog. bands are vastly more simplistic. I'm just trying to say that the ideas of music being complex, progressive, experimental, etc. are all extremely relative when you start using them as something other than specific genre names."
"Difference between the terms ""experimental"" and ""progressive""?","I would say that ""progressive"" is trying to improve while still having a general sound. ""Experimental"" would be branching out to completely different sounds and concepts."
"Difference between the terms ""experimental"" and ""progressive""?","I would say that 'progressive' is trying to push pre-existing boundaries, whereas experimental has no such boundaries. Its difficult. maybe experimental music could be considered progressive, but progressive music isn't always experimental kind of deal. Fingers and thumbs. I'm not sure. I can always tell the difference between them by my own definitions, although I can't always define them exactly. 

Edit: words and shit
"
"Difference between the terms ""experimental"" and ""progressive""?","What I think an Experimental song is: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ95g8uGlkI

After, the album this song is from, is an extreme departure from the three solo albums from Ihsahn, not because the sound is nuts and heavy as fuck ('cause it can be), but because he implemented blow instruments into the songwriting and that is completely out there, when it comes to metal. The fact that every single song on it is excellent, does no harm either. Be it insanity, chaos, despair, regret, elation, excitement... You name it. Ihsahn managed to convey and pass those concepts, wrap them around impeccable execution and blow everything you think doesn't work in metal away.

And a progressive one:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfZMTDcqKnQ

I know it is an entire album but the album is actually just one song. The concept is still the same during all of its duration and both versions, with vocals and instrumentals only, paint a very distinctive story. This is a trip to the depths of the ocean and/or of the human mind. I remember the first time listening I was so taken out of everything that when Benthic started playing, my body was waving together with the main riff, feeling the pressure and the waters passing through me. The band managed to turn their name into song and making sound into water is no easy task."

"Cloudkicker - It's bad. We're hit, man, we are hit. [HQ]","This song is the perfect musical capture of that moment when you realize something intense is about to occur, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it."
"Cloudkicker - It's bad. We're hit, man, we are hit. [HQ]","The best thing about cloudkicker is that he has albums for every mood and its hard to say which his best album is. However, Beacons is something special. There is ridiculous amount of power in the album. He really makes amazing use of repetition, not only on this album, but in all his work. "

I don't like much of no Heroes at all, but the [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hcUxV7BmSc) is pretty dope. Axe to fall is maybe the slowest album. I'm sure others will disagree. The first track, [Dark horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9wZDd_GgPs) is awesome though. Finally, their newest album, All we love we leave behind i really like.

"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","The albums leaked a few hours ago (**don't share links to illegal downloads.** Mark announced an album stream for tomorrow, if you can't find a download link). 

What does everyone think of it?

Juggernaut: Alpha has quite the few pop-ish moments, I noticed. It takes some getting used to. In fact, the whole album might take a while to grow on me because this clearly isn't classic Periphery (not a bad thing). Reminds of The Dear Hunter, even though this album is more ""all-over-the-place"", in terms of genres, which I find hard to appreciate at the moment.

The second album is more like P2, I think. I like it a lot more than the first half. One gripe I have is the fact that Omega isn't the album closer. That track is, in my opinion, the best Periphery song to date. The last chorus, reprising Alpha's chorus, works perfectly. And the breakdown is fucking amazing. Then Strange Things comes on and, while it's not a bad song, it kind of just drags the album on unnecessarily.

Keep in mind I have no clue what the lyrical content is about.

Sorry if I'm doing something illegal, mods, but I think this is ok.

Edit: I'm hearing it for the second time, I forgot to mention how much I love the melody reprises throughout the album. And how much I hate that the album has these 1 second pauses between songs, even though they're clearly supposed to seamlessly flow into eachother. I hope it's only a problem in the leaked files.

"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","I think the pop nature of Alpha is representing the not so dire aspects of the story at that point and it takes a turn for the worst halfway through. Musically though I absolutely love both albums, they're so varied and extremely heavy. It sounds like Periphery but it's stuff they've never done before. "
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","Also what to add the story about the album is kinda related to the book ""The Shining.""  Matt said he was rereading that book while working on the album. Go read up on it and the story makes a lot more sense."

"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","I totally agree with this part. I really think some parts of the album just come off as more ""poppy"" because they are there to be theatric and serve the story.

"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","They have fucking done it. Periphery is raising the bar in the metal scene.  

Periphery is one of the few bands that has endless creativity and tight band chemistry. 

Periphery I, II, and Juggernaut are all so drastically different, yet each one was a phenomenal album with no filler, as in every song had a purpose. 

I can't wait to see where these guys are a year from now, 5 years from now, and 10 years from now and so on.  

Misha Mansoor is truly this generation's Jimi Hendrix, in my opinion. He knows how to produce and he knows how to play his instrument. He has produced and helped write on AAL's self titled and Joy of Motion. He has produced VoM's Eclipse and wrote 2 songs for the Halo 2 anniversary soundtrack. And he is extremely humble, which is something I highly respect.

His accomplishments speak for themselves. But Periphery isn't just Misha, it's Nolly, Jake, Matt, Spencer, and Mark. They were drawn to Misha's vision for Periphery and now are a supergroup as a result. 

Finally, Periphery has worked with Jeff Loomis, Guthrie Govan, and John Petrucci. 'Nuff said.

There is actually not a song on these two releases that I dislike. I'm really finding the flow and overall compositions of the two releases to be really complimentary of each other. Where I feel that Alpha has run its course with the more pop-ridden elements Omega comes in and balances the entire situation out. 
Idk about everyone else but the song Priestess is one of my favorite songs they've ever written."
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","Little late to the party but I always thought it was some person BORN during occult and devilish practices. Like so he could harbor the soul of a demon or the devil or something. By then you get to heavy heart and I imagine a teenager growing up with a literal demon inside him. So that's where the poppy sadness comes from. With alternating thoughts of coping with a demon I inside you and trying to live a normal life like that. 

By psychosphere, I imagine our protagonist has committed his first string of cultish murders himself but on a small scale. By reprise, he's sacrificing dozens of children to lucifer. Can't really explain priestess. 

By graveless, he's sacrificed himself whether out of defiance or subservience to the evil one. The rest of the album then involves his journey into hell, his seeking for redemption from whoever and eventual release amongst the stars.

Hand. Cannot. Erase."
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","Coming back to this comment after listening the shit out of both albums... Both great, but too different to compare I'd say. Steve Wilson isn't even metal, just has some influence from it. That's not a bad thing either. Hand cannot erase is beautiful, poppy, yet super proggy (took me forever to figure out that 21 count phrase in ancestral)

Personally, if I HAD to pick I'd say juggernaut but that's only because I'm a metal head. 

One thing that both albums get right is that they don't go for a ""proggy sound"" but are still very progressive in nature. Which honestly is how progressive music should be. Going for a ""prog"" sound is no more progressive than any other genre of music"

Wow, this is excellent scream-sing post-hardcore lyric writing right here, dude.  
  
I'm definitely going to give the full double album a few listens but I simply preferred the metalcore sound on the S/T to anything on PII or the singles I've heard from this.

"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","I'll say this: I typically am the one who gets upset when bands try new things. I set unrealistic expectations on music most times and its something I have to work on.  Having said that, I wasn't a huge fan of these riffery tracks as they debuted them. I can tell you the turning point was about 5 listens per song for me.  The Bad Thing, was the first one.  Suddenly the chorus got really catchy to me which begged for more listens.  I've listened to this stream all morning and I thought I only appreciated the later half of the album.  Now the only song I have a problem with is the ""Black Minute"" but I can already tell its growing on me.  I think you just have to take time to listen to these tracks to appreciate them. Its a different style so maybe the time it takes to enjoy it won't come as fast as say maybe some of the tracks off of the self titled album when we all first heard Periphery and that's ok too.  You can't force it either, just have to naturally shed those expectations on your own and see it for what it was intended to be.  Just think about how awesome these tracks are going to sound when their next album comes out. Just like how PII was to PI. Its human error man and all in our heads. "

"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","Awesome man, thanks for the share."
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","I absolutely love Juggernaut. Periphery has been one of my favorite bands these past few years and I'm glad that each album has a different feel to it. I'm pretty sure I will be listening to it a lot in the coming months, much like how I did with Periphery II.

A few things I'd like to note about Juggernaut that really stood out for me:

* The atmosphere is amazing. It's dark and mellow. It's exactly what I wanted to hear. As soon as I heard *The Scourge* back in November, I knew from the very beginning that it was going to an album I was going to love.
* Has anybody noticed that towards the end of certain songs (*MK Ultra*, *Priestess*, *Hell Below*, and even *Omega*) it has a jazzy elevator music vibe to it? It's pretty cool and it's something I noticed when *Hell Below* finished.
* Juggernaut ends right where it began. The best example I can give is how it was in Octavarium. At the very end of *Octavarium* you can hear *The Root of All Evil*, which is intentional. Well Juggernaut does that too, but I can't determine if it's intentional to the story or not. The same piano tune from *A Black Minute* is at the end of *Stranger Things*, which makes me think that the story sorta goes in circles.
* From what I'm gathering right now from the lyrics (I may be completely wrong of course, I'm always lost without knowing the actual lyrics) that the main character was on the verge of death as a young child but there was some sort of sacrificial ritual that gave them back life. The character lives in seclusion and her family is some sort of cult. I'm trying to piece that together with everything in the album, but I'm pretty sure it's supernatural stuff. Another alternative theory I have is that the main character has some telekinesis/telepathic/psychokinesis powers and that person is tapping into the minds of others. Maybe all of their voices get in her heard and she rebels? I've also got a pretty huge hunch that the main character is a female. That's mainly based off of hearing ""she"" somewhere on the album, but it makes sense since the [most visible person on the Alpha cover looks like a female](http://i.imgur.com/ZJYmp6T.jpg).

Overall I think I'm going to be making this one of my favorite albums ever. I've enjoyed it the many times I've listened to it today. It was worth ordering the t-shirt/physical CD bundle, buying each released song, and going to the concert. I can't wait until the CDs come in so I can actually have a higher quality version of the album. "
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","I really want the Cds and artwork so I can really get the entire feel of the album. The lyrics seem like they play a massive part in the mood and tone of the songs this time."
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","Rainbow Gravity = Icarus 2.0 and its gr8"
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","I've seen a lot of comments about the story, and just wanted to say that my friend sent me a picture of an interview with Halpern in Drum Magazine where he said that the story revolved around ""a child born into a sadistic cult, his escape and subsequent life choices.""

If this is true (and I think it more than likely is), the only concrete event I think I've found is in the Scourge which I believe is his escape (""I am now free""/""I will survive"").

Speculation: On Matt Halpern's kick head is the full Alpha cover and in the background you can see many sets of eyes. So I think after the child escapes the ""22 Faces"" still haunt him, very vague I know. And my friend also has a theory that the elevator music shorts are the main character going in/out of the ""crack in the earth"" mentioned in The Bad Thing."
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","Oh right, the elevator music. The first time I listened to the album I spouted a decisive ""what the fuck"" when I heard the ""Laser Speed""-like outro in MK Ultra."
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","My initial reaction was somewhere between a ""this is interesting"" and ""fuck yeah"", probably something like ""this is fucking yeah"" "
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","Sounded like something out of the Gran Turismo menu screens to me :)"
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","I personally don't think their albums are more poppy. Like I understand where people are coming from but I just think they had certain visions for certain songs or ways they wanted to go about with the writing progress. Also they experimented a lot more. Like its the first time (I guess) they do something somewhat jazzy. They also showed that they can be heavy if they want but what's the point of making a whole heavy album? That seems like something they'd do on another project and I think they of all people would find it extremely boring. Specially since they don't listen to much heavy stuff. 

On another note they REALLY stepped up their game as far as how well the vocals go with the music. Spencer has always been one of my favorite vocalists because he always seems like he's out there to prove something due to how some of the fanbase feels about him. But in the periphery II everything just seemed really off with him. Like his vocals despite being great and much better than their first self titled didn't seem to fit. But this time around he just stomped it to be honest. This has become my favorite release from them. Mostly because I really wasn't expecting anything specific (as much as I want every periphery song to sound like zero from clear). They brought new stuff and really did a great job of making it fit well. My take on this release. "
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","I am absolutely loving the albums.  I've enjoyed Periphery's previous albums, but this is something else completely.  This is their opus in my opinion.  What has everyone thought of the story?  I'm still trying to piece it together.  It has a kind of Bioshock vibe to me.  Potential spoilers beyond this point? From what I've gathered our main heroine was born with esp or some kind of power to see glimpses of other dimensions.  The world she lives in during Alpha controls her and limits her abilities.  She feels trapped and wants to be free(Elisabeth from Bioshock Infinite anyone?).  In the beginning of Omega she manages to enter a rift to one of these other worlds.  ""Transcend these earthly boundaries.""  She finds things are much darker on the other side.  Still piecing together the occult bits that dominate Omega.  It sounds like she is trapped and forced to die over and over again.  The shared musical themes in this parallel universe seem to reinforce this idea.  Or maybe I'm completely wrong lol?  Any ideas?"
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","Is it just me or is Priestess one of their most awesome songs ever?
Anyone else get a definite Opeth vibe with it?"
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","Mark is a big Opeth fan and was the one who wrote the main theme/riff of this song so I could definitely see how something like the note shifts in ""Hope Leaves"" could be an influence. That was a run-on sentence. "
"[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega","Epic run on sentence that was. I just thought the other day too that the entire ending section from 4:13 onward just sounds like it could have come from Damnation. Almost reminds me of To Rid The Disease."

"I want to recommend a band","Because I have been enjoying this artist so much over the past few weeks, I thought other would enjoy it too.  

It's Thank You Scientist. They're such and incredible and talented band. I saw then open for Periphery and I honestly think they were the best out of everyone that played that night.  

They also opened for Coheed And Cambria since Claudio signed them on his personal record company. 

Let me know what you think."
"I want to recommend a band","Oh trust me dude, /r/progmetal is well aware of Thank You Scientist. I believe they actually did an AMA all the way back in 2013. They're an incredible band. I've seen tons and tons of live shows but I can confidently say that I've never seen a live guitarist perform better than Tom Monda. Every single note is crystal clear. He can shred just as fast as Jeff Loomis. His note choices are impeccable. His sense of melody, groove, arrangement, all of it is top notch. Not to mention the fretless guitar.  
  
I actually booked and played with Thank You Scientist in a small basement venue last April. I think we had maybe 15 people turn out? Their next tour was direct support for Coheed and Cambria and following that is the current Periphery tour. What a huge jump to make. It couldn't happen to nicer people, either."
"I want to recommend a band","Oh they get plenty of love around here, don't worry! Fantastic band, they were one of my favorite openers for Coheed yet. I seriously can't wait for their next album if [Blue Automatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDJBL1gqHxE) is anything to go by. 

By the way, shoutout for /r/thankyouscientist! "

"Tool - You Lied [9:17]",""
"Tool - You Lied [9:17]","This song is a cover from justin chancellor's old band peach"
"Tool - You Lied [9:17]","Man I haven't heard this in years. Tool was kind of a gateway band for me but it still holds up IMO"
"Tool - You Lied [9:17]","Yeah Tool are one of those bands I've never really tired of. Every year at some point I seem to go on a big Tool kick again."
"Tool - You Lied [9:17]","I became obsessed with Lateralus during my junior year of high school, and a decade later it's still my favorite album. 

I've listened to plenty of amazing music since then, but I don't think anything will ever quite surpass the effect that album had on me when I first discovered it. 

(Some albums that have come close: Karnivool's Sound Awake, TesseracT's One, Telefon Tel Aviv's Immolate Yourself, the first Periphery album)."
"Tool - You Lied [9:17]","Same thing with me.  Came out when I was 13.  Heard Schism on the radio while staring at the stars in the middle of the night out in the country at 1 in the morning.  That was back when they weren't clipping long songs for airtime.  It was a very spiritual experience.  Told my Mom I wanted the CD for my birthday, and being as she liked rock too, I was able to listen to it as much as I wanted in the house.

Later, bought the rest of their CDs with birthday/Christmas money within the next 3 years.  Made me really introspective at an important time in my life, and it was a blessing, really.  I started discovering my own spirituality, became infatuated with art and music, and started learning how to play guitar.  Am now 26, and spend a large amount my time playing and writing music(on my own, not in any bands).  I had a fairly shitty childhood, and went to a pretty racist school(I'm white, but grew up in the ""ghetto"" if you will).  So, after dealing with stupid shit all day, I was able to go home and lose myself to music and art.  I give Tool the majority of the credit for my love of art."
"Tool - You Lied [9:17]","Funny thing is that I've devoted a huge part of the last decade to music (generally writing and recording on my own) and writing fiction. Tool was definitely a catalyst for my appreciation of music.

Oddly enough, Schism never quite grabbed me when I first heard it on the radio."
"Tool - You Lied [9:17]","I'm telling you man, it's that breakdown part half way where everyone stops and Adam plays alone(that A note section), and Justin slowly joins back.  As a kid, I was obsessed with astronomy and the stars, and I was lucky enough to camp at someone's property in the country that night.  That song was just perfect.

"Tool - You Lied [9:17]","Please go and read up on U-G, or check out Tool Archive's youtube page.  The band and their legal team has been dealing with a lawsuit for a long time now that keeps derailing the album's production, and some of the guys have had personal things going on too that have come up."

\* Jem Godfrey is the founder of the band, and wrote/recorded everything for the 1st album, then got in John Mitchell to record real guitar work, and Andy Edwards on drums. Some songs still have the original programmed drums as well as Andy's on them, dual-tracked. These days they're more of a ""proper"" band, although they're sporadic with releases. I'm quite the Frost* nerd…"

"The Contortionist - Vessel. This album has really been hitting the spot this week.","They've actually *gained* members since then. After the bands' first two records (Exoplanet, Intrinsic) they changed their vocalist and bassist. They also got a keyboard player. So they in total went from 5 -&gt; 6 members.

If I remember correctly Jon Carpenter (Singer) left to be a dad/with his family.

I think that had a large impact on their sound  - Mike (New singer) has a focus on harmonization with his cleans, with some okayish harsh vocals - which is a pretty drastic change from Jon's vocals.

I don't know exactly why Chris Tilley (Old bassist) left."
"The Contortionist - Vessel. This album has really been hitting the spot this week.","I wonder how much influence the bassist had on the writing. Can you recommend anything with a similar style as exoplanet? I'd recommend no consequence, monuments and sikth if you haven't listened to em yet"

Amazing heavy grooves through out the whole thing, contrasted with beautiful ambient/instrumental sections, combined with super powerful vocals and lyrical themes - the human race looking for a new planet to live on.

"Destrage - Neverending Mary","One of my favorite songs off of TKiFO.  The beginning is just in your face aggressive metal, and the ending makes me want to bust out my not so sweet dance moves.  Actually, the end *may* be my favorite riff off the album."
"Destrage - Neverending Mary","Nice chorus, but I hate that snare somewhat unreasonably &lt;.&lt; it was st. anger quality bad. And after research, it turns out that it's pretty much like that in every song ._."
"Destrage - Neverending Mary","Nah it doesn't sound nearly as ""baseball bat hitting trashcan"" sounding, and the way the song is mixed you can't hear the snare nearly as much as St. Anger. That being said, it's not great. "
"Destrage - Neverending Mary","Really? I think the drums sound great. They aren't over produced and ACTUALLY SOUND LIKE LIVE DRUMS which is something missing from a ton of modern metal. "
"Destrage - Neverending Mary","Possibly! Maybe 'm just jaded by modern production techniques and so on :)"
"Destrage - Neverending Mary","I understand, what with super clean production becoming more and more popular (largely, imo, because of bands like Periphery and TesseracT). I'm also a huge Destrage fanboy and am possibly biased in that sense :) but yeah, I dig the more raw sound TKiFO offers after listening to so many drum machines haha"

"Vola - Gutter Moon - uplifting and beautiful ""Mew + Metal"" (FFO: hmmm... Being, The Algorithm, DMM, Voyager, some strange combination of those?)","I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I love the wave of cheerful/uplifting metal of the last couple years. Nothing against more aggressively-oriented music, and there's certainly times when I just want to be energized by some loud metal, but most of the time I want groove and melody, and this has it in spades. 

Almost some post-rocky textures, the synths in particular remind me of Maybeshewill or something (I Was Here For a Moment, Then I Was Gone in particular), but I haven't gotten such a nice vibe from a djenty song in quite some time. Closest I can think of off the top of my head would be the guitarist from Uneven Structure's [major reinterpretation of Admit Defeat](https://soundcloud.com/worc/admet-des-faits-monuments) originally by Monuments. "

"The mods are asleep, post Necrophagist- Stabwound","I agree with you a bit on DLC, I didn't care for them much. But what do you mean by soft? As in clean vocals? Because Contortionist just released a *very* prog metal album called Language, and it's 95% clean vocals, and it's amazing.

"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","So, I love concept albums. Most of us here do. And I recently had my mind blown by [heavyblog's BTBAM breakdown](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2012/07/24/prognotes-between-the-buried-and-mes-the-parallax-part-i-introduction/), which got me to thinking about some of my other favorite endings to albums. You may or may not have had similar experiences with these albums and songs, but I'd be curious to hear your input on some of my favorite ambiguous endings:

* **Isolate** (Circus Maximus). What exactly does the ominous clank and cut-off of the music represent? To me, the final lyrics (""I'm a survivor and this is my destiny"") represent our protagonist finally defeating his insanity. But then what about the orchestral bit that follows? It's positive. Perhaps a bit exhausted, but definitely hopeful. And then the sudden clank. It's a plot twist! Does it represent a relapse back into insanity, or was he never in control of his mind in the first place? His triumphant declaration could just have been shouted at padded walls....What do you think it all means?

* **The Great Escape** (Seventh Wonder). What does the final instrumental section represent? It obviously mirrors the opening section, in which Earth (""Tellus"" from Wiseman) says a tearful goodbye to her destructive children (humanity). But the final section has no lyrics. Interesting! Does this mean that Earth has forever lost her voice (humanity's sins were irreversible)? What emotion is being communicated? My current head canon is ""forgiveness,"" but I'm undecided whether this comes from a dying mother earth or a now thriving one sans humanity (as they tragically perish in space, unbeknownst to Earth). The final section is positive, trails off, and feels more definite than the first one, though still tender. What's your head canon?

* **V- The New Mythology Suite** (Symphony X). What does that last three-note cello bit mean? I might be reading too much into this, but I really feel like that motif is the final word in the story: the moral, the summary, the feeling we're meant to leave with as Atlantis slips forever away. I take it as one part cautionary (learn from Atlantis's technological hubris), one part sorrow (everything I've ever known is forever lost), and one part hopeful (whoever hears this tale won't repeat the same mistakes). What's your take?

* **King of Terrors** (also Symphony X). The song closely follows Poe's short story, The Pit and the Pendulum, but does it part ways at the end? In Poe's version, the protagonist is saved by French soldiers moments from his death. So why does King of Terrors end on such a menacing fade out? Does it represent the fading terror he leaves behind as he is taken to safety, or is it maybe a dark creative license taken by the band...Is the final ""...LAST"" really his last breath?

I apologize for the wall of text that maybe not very many will relate to, but I had to get these thoughts written down somewhere, and I don't know of a better community to share them with. Cheers if you read it all."
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","That HeavyBlogIsHeavy BTBAM article is super interesting. I'm just listening/reading through the story of the prospects, their stories. Thanks for the link."
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","Oh man, such a wonderful journey. I'm glad you're enjoying it :)"
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","Dude, yeah. Just finished reading / listening through the whole thing.... it's insane. All these references to the Night Owls and the Prospects throughout BTBAM's discography. I've listened to all their albums' countless times, but with the story to Parallax II sorta explained it's even better. This idea of ""Night Owls"" watching over us and predicting our futures is creepy as fuck, too.... especially at midnight haha. 

The whole album creates really interesting (and at times creepy) images and appearances for these characters and places in my mind. A really interesting story, wow. Really sweet stuff. 

Also interesting is (the 2 year old, but whatever) comments where people are like ""what if this...."" or ""I think...."" and go in a completely different direction than the write up.

Fantastic music and story telling. I'm blown away."
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","&gt; Fantastic music and story telling. I'm blown away.

100% how I feel.

If you like horror movies, The Fourth Kind is about as close to a cinematic representation of the Night Owls as you'll find."
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","I'll check it out, thanks"
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","I didn't even know Isolate was a concept album. I knew that the Great Escape *song* was a story, but I didn't think album was a concept album either."
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","I didn't either for a time! Isolate is a concept album about one man's battle against insanity. Totally interesting!

And The Great Escape isn't technically a concept album, though some songs are independently connected:

* Long Way Home is the prequel to Alley Cat, involving a protagonist named Jackie who grows up in an abusive household and ends up with co-dependency issues.

* King of Whitewater is about a Swedish legend of a river sprite that lures people in with violin music and then murders them...

* Angelmaker is about a woman who ran an orphanage for profit and horribly mistreated the kids.

* Move on Through is about how music helps people cope with life.

* Wiseman is about a man predicting what will happen in The Great Escape.

* The Great Escape is about humanity bailing on the Earth they destroyed, flying into space to their death. Basically Wall-E, but with the opposite ending."
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","I guess thinking back to Isolate now, it makes sense. I never listened to it looking for a story, but in songs like A Darkened Mind, Abyss, Mouth of Madness, that is incredibly obvious. The whole album actually matches up with that plot but those songs came to mind instantly. "
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","Persefone's Spiritual Migration has an instrumental final track, it basically reiterates much of the thematic and motivic material throughout the album in kind of an anti-overture. I think it's kind of a representation of the cycle of life and death that is sort of discussed in the album, as the album speaks about the concept of *samsara* prevalent in many Asian religions. "
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","Love that album (and song)!"
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","Hm, I'll need to listen back through that album. I adore it for the music, but I admit I've never really dug into the lyrics. Good thoughts!"
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","And don't forget ""Core"", which is a clear concept album, with one story told from three intertwining angles. I love it just as much as ""Spiritual Migration""!"
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","Wow, I can't believe I stopped at shin-ken and SM...Persefone is an incredible band, and I now require Core in my life."
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","What's interesting to me is how The Contortionist's album **Exoplanet** ends. 

• ""This extra solar vessel, orbiting the cluster.
Ejects the sample pods of the Eden passengers.
As for us, we must migrate.
This exoplanet has failed.""

- Exoplanet III: Light

It's obvious the passengers failed their objective. The songs title is Light however. Light is supposed to benevolent, yet they fail? What's next? And the undulating pulse at the end is ominous and eerie. Is it a beacon? An SOS to the pods or the colony? A beacon not shut off at the colony, that says, ""Exoplanet is A-OK, colony is thriving"" that will doom future comers? Such a poignant way to end a concept record.

Another TC album, **Intrinsic** centers around a fabricated dream realm, and the main character is being tested on, or is he?

• ""Sensing a new wave of neuronal presence in the field / Entropic clues
tells me this is not a dream / I'm melding into surroundings The terror
and the fear feels as if it's mine alone""

- Solipsis

From Solipsis, an interesting title. Solipsism is the philosophy that only I exist and everything outside the mind is a fabrication of my mind. The song is short, but brutal, full of awkward time changes. Making it jarring and quick. A reference to the character's thoughts? The next song is an synth-filled track, with bits of vocals saying ""I can feel/see"". Did he get lost in his mind? Did he create this reality (including the experiments) and now he scrambled his brain and created an existence in stasis? Is he in a stasis because of the dream testing, and now holds the key to creation/God?
"
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","Really cool thoughts here!

I think I need to give The Contortionist another shot. I saw them live with BTBAM and even bought a copy of Intrinsic. Didn't hate it, but didn't really love it either. Everyone here seems to love them, though, so I'll give them a few more spins, as well as checking out Exoplanet and Language.

From your thoughts here, it sounds like there's loads of story and context in their music that I hadn't noticed at all. Thanks for bringing this band back to my attention!"
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","Language is a masterpiece, but I can't listen to it as often as the other two. Intrinsic was definitely  sleeper record. While Exoplanet is regarded as their best, and it really has its moments, Intrinsic was never given a fair shake.

Exoplanet is beautiful light music written around lots of heavy passages. The contrast is nice and serves its purpose. It makes the narrative more severe.

Intrinsic is heavy passages written around pretty music. Different flow. Lighter tone, not enough moshing. Just kidding, it has its brutal moments and because there aren't as meany heavy moments, it amplifies the severity of our character. Makes the brutal parts cooler too.

Anyways, Intrinsic's story is a little subtle, but is definitely there. Here's what Jon Carpenter said,

&gt; Intrinsic‘s lyrics were aimed to be a science-fiction inspired conceptual storyline. It’s like a handful of puzzle pieces. Instrumentals that have different feels and styles. The Contortionist has always been about contrast, the heaviest and then the most beautiful. This provides a very wide range of emotions to write over. We want the listener to feel the ups and downs and to get engaged in the content. When piecing it all together lyrically… I wanted the concepts to be present without being overbearing. The fans who go looking for the details will find them and the casual listener can listen to any song and enjoy a small piece of the puzzle. Never leaving the boundaries of the mind, the first five songs range from mind/brain phenomena and reality theories to religion and mind trips. The last five are from the perspective of future patients coping with a shared reality scenario; a narrative on the potential of using technology to achieve a perfect dream you could feel and control with ease. There’s an eerie uncertainty to how a person’s psyche will react to that degree of extended consciousness.
&gt;"
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","Ah, so I stumbled on their worst album then. Exoplanet and Language, here I come!"
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","Haha, I wouldn't say that, but as far as fans think, Exo is god tier and Language is a masterpiece. Poor poor Intrinsic. Enjoy! Language is a concept record too, but not a story record really. It's more spiritual and such. Haven't read the lyrics in their entirety yet."
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","Big fan right here. I think language is the worst. Exoplanet is my favorite by far. Just my opinion though. "
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","[deleted]"
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","I'm inclined to agree with you. I like it, but Language I and II are pretty ill. Sad that's the best from the record. I was super stoked for it too. Intrinsic is a very close second to Exoplanet, I think. Wish Carpenter could have stayed."

"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","Maybe since the Exoplanet failed, they released the sample pods hoping they will be found by someone/something else or land on a different planet? Last ditch effort by them. "
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","A desperate measure which only makes their end even more weighted. I love it ending like that."
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","I also did a quick mini-writeup on Exoplanet a while back regarding concept albums and how they tend to ""revisit"" certain aspects of itself, but from a musical standpoint rather than storytelling.

There may be more, but these are the ones I've found.
"
"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","I remember reading your comment someplace regarding some of these points.  Haven't noticed the beeping in Vessel, I'll have to give it another listen. Wonder why the pattern 5 is significant."

"Do you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!","Nice find! That's rather an excellent article and very interesting.

To add to the list: I really like the ending of Appearance of Nothing's album ""All Gods are Gone"". The song is called ""The Rise and Fall of Nothing"". Unfortunately I don't have a deep analysis of it, I just think it's a great ending. 

I love the contrast between the quick pace and hard drums present throughout the album and the very ominous sounding and slow ending to the whole thing. Also, I'm a total sucker for unsettling sounding piano pieces."

"Full stream of Chaos Divine's new album 'Colliding Skies' is now on SoundCloud","https://soundcloud.com/chaosdivine/sets/colliding-skies

&amp;nbsp;

... and it's quite good. According to [their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/chaosdivine/posts/10152871958088122) this stream is courtesy of Heavy Music Magazine and should disappear after this week, so best listen to it while you can.

&amp;nbsp;

If you don't know Chaos Divine, they're a great band from Perth, Australia, self-described as 'Progressive Heavy Rock', which roughly translates to 'mostly clean Progressive Metal with occasional tasteful Death Metal vocals'. Their previous album, 2011's 'The Human Connection', is one of my favourites and this new one sounds great as well.

&amp;nbsp;

The new album was [successfully crowdfunded](http://www.pozible.com/project/180797) last year and can now be pre-ordered [here](http://www.nervegas.com.au/?rf=kw&amp;kw=colliding+skies). It will be released March 6th.

"Deftones - Gauze [Got this song in my head and this album on repeat this week]","They're metal, and pushing on the progressive side with unorthodox writing styles (6 string versus 8, drop a# versus drop e, no knowledge of music theory) used while still being melodic "
"Deftones - Gauze [Got this song in my head and this album on repeat this week]","All their songs follow standard song structure (verse-&gt;chorus-&gt;verse-&gt;chorus-&gt;bridge-&gt;conclusion).

That's not progressive in a lot of people's books. Just because they use low tunings or odd time signatures doesn't mean they're progressive. Heck, Red Hot Chili Peppers play in drop D - you going to argue they're progressive? Mountains by Biffy Clyro is in 15/8. but it's not a progressive song. Hey Ya by Outkast is in 11/4 - is that prog metal?

&gt;no knowledge of music theory

man, now THAT is prog."
"Deftones - Gauze [Got this song in my head and this album on repeat this week]","I'm not saying that they are special because they play in drop tunings, but because both Chino and Steph play two COMPLETELY different tunings (as in Chino plays drop A# while Steph plays drop E). Also, what I meant by the Deftones having no knowledge of music theory while still being progressive was that they are still able to make well flowing songs without having a set idea of what they are going to come out with. Granted, that's more experimental than progressive, but I still believe that they fall in the same vein. Again, everything I'm arguing for is my opinion. I just believe that the parameters I set for a band to be progressive has been met in my eyes. I won't try to persuade you to have the same opinion as me, I would just like to validate my points."
"Deftones - Gauze [Got this song in my head and this album on repeat this week]","I agree to an extent but I think Deftones definitely have a lot of prog elements, and their older stuff influenced a lot of bands."

"Question regarding Matt Halpern's (Drummer of Periphery) technique?","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKlSU6aABRc Trying to figure out how Matt Halpern is constantly dribbling ghost notes on his snare drum....(skip to 4:00...shows a GREAT example of this) I KNOW the Moeller has to be involved (I know how it works) but I don't know how to keep it constantly dribbling like that without tiring myself or tensing up my arms....if anyone can help me figure out exercises for that that'd be greatly appreciated."
"Question regarding Matt Halpern's (Drummer of Periphery) technique?","You're in luck! I took a few lessons from Matt years ago and I also asked about ghost notes. Here's the exercise he gave me, it's basically a variation of a Thomas Lang exercise but with ghost notes incorporated.
So R=snare K=kick r= ghost note snare

R K r K R K r..... count up to 8 or whatever then switch to your left hand. once you good at it you want to start doing variations like

R K r K L K l K R K r K L K l K....expert mode incorporate ghost kicks as well."

"Question regarding Matt Halpern's (Drummer of Periphery) technique?","It looks like he's using his fingers to bounce the stick more and using ghost notes mostly in between the bass drum hits which might help with the endurance. "
"Question regarding Matt Halpern's (Drummer of Periphery) technique?","Matchstick grip at 4:00 combined with the Moeller technique. It's an exaggerated whipping technique that allows gravity to do most of the work. E.g. : When playing the accented note(s) he is creating momentum and allowing the rebound to drag and rebound multiple times with his other fingers."
"Question regarding Matt Halpern's (Drummer of Periphery) technique?","Just hit the snare lightly? He is using a lot of fingers instead of wrist. There's no real secret to it"

"Dream Theater - Blind Faith (Because of a recent great album post.)","I know it's a bit of an odd choice for a favorite DT song, but this might be mine.  I can't put a finger on it really, but I think it's a mesh of different reasons.  Nostalgia for one, since this was my first DT album, and the fact that the riff at 5:42 has been one of my favorite things to play for years now.  The piano interlude is really nice; the crazy-unison-keyboard-guitar part at the end that somehow doesn't feel like just wankery and is still awesome... And I think the fact that it's just kinda upbeat and softer on the metal side gives it a wider appeal.  

In addition, I think this album was DT's peak, and they've been rolling downhill since (not always far downhill, but downhill).  I could probably fairly say this was their last GREAT album, even if there have been some really good ones since.

"
"Dream Theater - Blind Faith (Because of a recent great album post.)","I think I'm going to have to agree with you, although the fans of DT's heavier side will hate you for leaving songs like As I Am from Train of Thought out of the list. My favourite thing (by far) in this song is Portnoy's playing - although the entire song is fantastic. That 5:42 riff.. daaaamn. "
"Dream Theater - Blind Faith (Because of a recent great album post.)","Actually I'd be pretty surprised at someone having As I Am as their favorite DT song, that one's really straightforward and relatively plain.  Is that really a popular one?  I'd be putting my money on things like Metropolis Pt 1, Change of Seasons, Glass Prison, Octavarium, Dance of Eternity, etc etc.  The one's that are more signature DT."
"Dream Theater - Blind Faith (Because of a recent great album post.)","It was the first song to pop into my mind because I remember a good friend of mine idolising As I Am and Endless Sacrifice. Had to be a song after SDoIT. Speaking of Octavarium: I hated the entire album since I first bought it as a kid back in 2005 'till about a year ago. The song isin't bad at all!"
"Dream Theater - Blind Faith (Because of a recent great album post.)","Oh yeah Octavarium is actually one of my favorite songs, and some of the others from the album are good, but there's some big weak spots in that album."
"Dream Theater - Blind Faith (Because of a recent great album post.)","I agree that this one is great, but Train of Thought and Octivarium were both pretty great in their own ways."
"Dream Theater - Blind Faith (Because of a recent great album post.)","My favorite unison section ever!"
"Dream Theater - Blind Faith (Because of a recent great album post.)","Absolutely, it's so glorious. 

6DOIT might be my fav DT album. "
"Dream Theater - Blind Faith (Because of a recent great album post.)","I've said this a number of times recently, but this is probably in my top 5 DT songs. Just so good in every way. It's only behind Learning to Live and a couple of the epics.

This is my favorite cd at least from the perspective of Jordan Rudess. Scenes has some great stuff, but I think he shows a bit of restraint throughout this cd, hardly ever over playing, and the keyboard sections in this song are amazing."
"Dream Theater - Blind Faith (Because of a recent great album post.)","Not to say say I dislike lyrics Petrucci writes, I love them, but whenever Labrie writes the lyrics to one of their songs it always stands out so much to me. I love the bridge: 

And still life pushes on/With or without you/We've got to carry on/Our will, will guide us to/A place where we belong/
Know there lies the truth/I am the believer who gives purpose on to you

Also, dat unison is insane."

"What is your favorite interlude or intro?","I've always thought this was often the case with a lot of bands I liked in the early 2000s.

This whole album was actually good, but **Shadows Fall**'s ""Casting Shade"" and ""Prelude to Disaster"" were so incredible. They lent such good *balance* (that was a pun, who knows why?) to the album. "

"
"What is your favorite interlude or intro?","I love that slow fade in of the double bass on the drums. It goes from nice and peaceful to the insanity that is the rest of the album. So awesome."
"What is your favorite interlude or intro?","Speaking of **Devin Townsend**, ""Effervescent!"" which leads perfectly into ""True North"" really had me falling in love with Devin. His ability to do so many styles, so well, so honestly, while maintaing the essence of who he is, befuddles me. This man has to be schizophrenic. It's so different from his other, equally awesome stuff. "

as for me, one of my favorites is Swan Lake by The Agonist. it's an a capella performance by their vocalist who layered her voice multiple times. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsrkEmFUR4c)"
"What is your favorite interlude or intro?","[The Crusher](http://youtu.be/bNz0SbDsNoQ?t=6m14s), by Shadow Gallery, the second part of “Cliffhanger 2”, from *Legacy*. My favourite fully instrumental interlude in prog metal. Not even the guys from DT have come close to building such an epic."
"What is your favorite interlude or intro?","The Ocean - Siderian. How it builds up to Rhyacian is amazing.

"What is your favorite interlude or intro?","I've recently really fallen for the intro of Gamma Ray's [Rebellion in Dreamland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9sTRjFHJn8). I have to listen to the first minute or so multiple times whenever I listen to it."

"What is your favorite interlude or intro?","In all prog metal I've been listening to recently, it would be Symphony X - Seven. Very fast, angry, and in-your-face."
"What is your favorite interlude or intro?","Despite the fact that it is fairly long, I thought the intro to [**Nowena 9.10**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kX2HiyRs6o) **by Amenra** was perfect. The whole thing serves as the perfect contrast to the mind bending intensity of the rest of the song."
"What is your favorite interlude or intro?","Yes - [Starship Trooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKftiJS30Cs)"
"What is your favorite interlude or intro?","Not sure if this is my favorite but I think [Epipelagic](http://youtu.be/As8CbyJRPmU) by The Ocean does a perfect job of setting the mood of the album as well as blending seamlessly into the watery sounding note of the next song. I think it fits in even more when you take into consideration the album's concept of sinking deeper into the ocean/mind as it sounds like you're on the surface of the water (and in a cave for some reason)."
"What is your favorite interlude or intro?","The last time this kind of thread was brought up, I mentioned my love of [Rishloo's ""My Favorite Things""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UElrfsoFEo0) and [Cire's ""Tryptamind""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELKUE1usUhg), so there they are again.

As far as intros to actual full songs go, [""Upgrade^Brigade"" by Fair to Midland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt0Rzd0quFs) is so fulfilling, especially that last set of notes before the verse proper starts."
"What is your favorite interlude or intro?","If you consider the ending 2 minutes or so of Protest the Hero's Palms Read an interlude, than that is my favorite."

"Tommy of BTBAM's Instagram Post. Can't tell if he's just playing around or if it could be new material","Honestly metal vocals often sound really funny by themselves but once you layer the vocals and add music it's night and day."
"Tommy of BTBAM's Instagram Post. Can't tell if he's just playing around or if it could be new material","You know how some metal bands release instrumental versions of their albums? Somebody should release a vocals-only version of their album. "

"Emergence - Silver Lights (FFO: Wide Eyes+Vocals, Kadinja, Astraeus)",""
"Emergence - Silver Lights (FFO: Wide Eyes+Vocals, Kadinja, Astraeus)","So the two guitar players from Wide Eyes, with their ridiculously frequent output, have this other project, Emergence, that is pretty much the more aggressive side of Wide Eyes plus some pretty crazy vocals. The growls aren't my bag of chips, but I can't deny they're quite explosive, and the cleans are intense. Remember I'd found a demo of this song on youtube a bit ago, didn't realize the album had come out!

Specifically about this song, the vocals right at :40 or so to finish that section are amazing, and my two favorite guitar grooves are both a little later in the song, 1:50 and near the end at 3:15, particularly remind me of Kadinja.

Check out the [rest of the album here](https://emergencemusicproject.bandcamp.com/album/emergence)."
"Emergence - Silver Lights (FFO: Wide Eyes+Vocals, Kadinja, Astraeus)","To add; that's the vocalist of Conducting From The Grave!

"Emergence - Silver Lights (FFO: Wide Eyes+Vocals, Kadinja, Astraeus)","Been listening to this album on a daily basis since its release. Definitely a great listen all the way through. Everything is super tight and sounds great, the production is really outstanding. "
"Vocalist Search (plz halp)","Greetings citizens of Prog metal,
Just putting it out there that my band is currently looking for a vocalist. Preferably in the Baltimore area, looking for someone with a wide range of screaming vocals (growls, yells, etc) and if you can sing as well that's a bonus. If you are interested in finding a band plz hit me up plz.

"Vocalist Search (plz halp)","I hate labels because the I feel like there's a pretense lol but I guess you could say progressive metalcore ish, we like to experiment a lot. Influences would probably be periphery, contortionist, BTBAM, some Erra, northlane (kinda) and disperse here and there. Stuff in that vein. If you like that type of stuff give me a shout"
