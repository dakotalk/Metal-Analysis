"Estatic Fear - Chapter IV (neoclassical doom/goth/black)","Estatic Fear is one of my favourite bands within the more ""atmospheric"" spectra of the metal universe with their stunningly beautiful atmosphere. A true masterpiece. [Chapter IV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPR4gLwXpZ4)

This band (and this album, their latest) are a favourite of mine for some time.. I recommend checking out all of their releases.  They are from a really great Spanish scene which does not get near enough recognition.

"The Blind Guide - O, Morning Star, The Carrier Has Grown Weary of His Route",""
"The Blind Guide - O, Morning Star, The Carrier Has Grown Weary of His Route","So for serious, what is it about SLC that produces interesting atmospheric metal bands? I used to think it was all the guy from Gallowbraid doing different projects, but now I'm thinking that's not accurate. Gallowbraid, Caladan Brood, Ered Wethrin, and now this. I think there's one more that I'm forgetting about."
"The Blind Guide - O, Morning Star, The Carrier Has Grown Weary of His Route","well, the funny thing about slc is that we have a music scene that is very alive in all aspects. Music from all genres is constantly being created and performed. Metal is no exception by any means, but the funny thing about what you said is that my roommate happens to play the lead guitar in a band with one of the gentleman who is behind the projects of calladan brood, gallowbraid etc. so I have totally met him and he is great! Yes salt lake seems lame, but in reality it's awesome and we have a swarm of great music here haha. I'm really hoping to keep making more in the near future here.
edit:just realized I posted this w/ my regular account haha. whelp I guess the secrets out"
"The Blind Guide - O, Morning Star, The Carrier Has Grown Weary of His Route","I'm from Utah, actually, although I live in Texas now, and it seems like all this stuff started happening after I moved :/"
"The Blind Guide - O, Morning Star, The Carrier Has Grown Weary of His Route","Hmmm when did you leave? As far I know that guy has been making those projects for quite sometime. As far all this music gong in it has always been that way. I suppose you become more aware of it as you yourself play in groups, and just get older in general. Know what I'm saying? "
"The Blind Guide - O, Morning Star, The Carrier Has Grown Weary of His Route","Ya. I moved at the beginning of 2013, but I already knew about Gallowbraid. The others have come out since then, and I didn't find out Gallowbraid was from SLC until I moved here. Looking forward to seeing what else my home state comes up with :)"
"The Blind Guide - O, Morning Star, The Carrier Has Grown Weary of His Route","Since you're some kind of insider, can you tell me if Gallowbraid has a site where I can buy their MP3s or something? All I could find was an album on Amazon that said it had to be imported."
"The Blind Guide - O, Morning Star, The Carrier Has Grown Weary of His Route","I haven't been able to find anywhere to buy electronic versions, but you can buy the CD from here: http://www.northern-silence.de/"
"WANTED: images","I'm thinking it's time to spice up the appearance of the subreddit, so I'm looking for an image for the header bar, a new alien, and anything else y'all think would be nifty. 

Theme ideas also accepted. This thread will be open for a while as I tinker, and feedback and criticism is always welcome."
"WANTED: images","if you need any help doing the CSS let me know, I've customized a few subs in my day. Wouldn't mind something kind of cliche like foggy mountains and dead trees..."
"WANTED: images","Ya, that's what I'm thinking. Instead of black I'm going to go dark bluish gray, I think. Just need some good images for the header bar to pick from.

I'm basically getting around to doing it now because I'm doing the codecademy.com course and I actually know how now :)

I was also thinking skulls for upvote and rainbow for downvote. I think that'd be pretty droll. I'm also not serious unless everyone likes the idea :)

EDIT: if you wanna, throw something together and I'll put it up. I was planning on doing it for practice, but if you actively want to do it, we can see what you put together."

"Agalloch's new album is up in full on NPR. Enjoy!","So what's your opinion?  I'm finding it pretty boring but I'm not all that surprised (for me, each subsequent album since Pale Folklore has been a small step down).  Love the Musk Ox tracks though.  Best track on first listen was Vales Beyond Dimension, or the last section of Plateau of the Ages.

Agalloch is still a wonderful band after all these years.."
"Agalloch's new album is up in full on NPR. Enjoy!","After a first listen, I think I like it. It's more subdued than anything else they've done, but it's also more intricate. There's a lot of subtlety there, which for me was sometimes lost in the noise in Marrow. I'll have to give it another 20 listens and see how I rank it against the others. And for the record, my favorite of theirs was Ashes Against the Grain. :)"

"Agalloch's new album is up in full on NPR. Enjoy!","Nice.. yeah most newer Agalloch fans don't appreciate Pale Folklore but to me its easily their best.  I love John Haughm's ""imperfect"" style of drumming and I think it suits the folk aspects of the music so well.  The first two albums are genuine masterpieces, and although I still enjoy the more recent stuff, it doesn't quite measure up in terms of allure, mystery, and charm."

"
"Holy crap, Agalloch has actual music videos, and they're awful.  Sad, really","What don't you like about this video? It has everything I expect from them, really; natural landscapes and metal. I love this video. I don't enjoy that the song is cut and shortened, but that's my only complaint.

"Nocternity - Valyrian Steel (Blood Of The Dragon)","I highly suggest you try listening to the album from the beginning. It's one of those albums that got progressively better for me each time I heard it. The mixing and atmosphere of this album make it a bit inaccessible at first, but it's a very intentional sound that makes itself more apparent after a few listens. A very cold sound.

This is indeed an atmospheric black metal classic that everyone should at least be somewhat familiar with, IMO.

EDIT: Link to the full album: [Nocternity - Onyx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FuYZL5UiBM). Stay for the intro at least!"
"Nocternity - Valyrian Steel (Blood Of The Dragon)","Over the years its worked its way into the company of the very most rarefied black metal albums.. It really is a beast.  Its a mystery as to why there is not more output from them, a couple songs here and there every few years and little more (and nothing coming even close to the sound nor the quality of Onyx).

My favorite thing about this album is easily the drums.. so close to just obliterating everything else, its a rampaging battery of sound that perfectly suits the mood and style of the guitars/vocals.  I will always come back to this album."
"Nocternity - Valyrian Steel (Blood Of The Dragon)","One of my favorite black metal albums! Also my favorite track on the album. This is definitely atmospheric, which isn't synonymous with slow/ambient! The guitar tone is perfectly mixed for an icy wall of sound, and almost nothing comes close to the sound Nocternity achieves.

I have to say, it took me some time to ""come around"" to the Nocternity sound, but this is the song that eventually captured me."

I can't seem to find much information on them, but I really, really like what I'm hearing. I love this new generation of bands growing up on Agalloch, the influence runs deep with this band; I imagine they got their name from In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion (""this pantheon of oak, this citadel of stone"").

Thank you for turning me onto this band, next paycheck I'm buying an EP."

"Gallowbraid - Ashen Eidolon","He also said that he wasn't going to release anymore music in this style because people compared him too much to Agalloch and called his music ""Hipster metal"". Even goes as far as to say that he should never have released music he wrote in high school. 

I am really not sure what to expect of this release. Its a shame he let people get to him like that."
"Gallowbraid - Ashen Eidolon","I think he needs to pay more attention to the people who liked it and less to the people who didn't. Fuck those people. There's an entire genre like Agalloch and many of those bands are excellent. And, you know, found in this subreddit."
"Gallowbraid - Ashen Eidolon","That is a shame. "
"Gallowbraid - Ashen Eidolon","There is a sixth track that was released in the ""Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer"" compilation! Called Earthen Throne. Or if you already knew about that one you're probably missing the bonus track on Ashen Eidolon called Stone of Remembrance.

I feel that it works very well with the black metal aesthetic....it's very strongly pronounced, with much accentuation is available to use, and in general I just really enjoy it. It's been something I've worked hard on for many years, and seeing as there's not really any market for me when I get my degree in 6 months, well...why not utilize what I've been studying for most of my life?"
