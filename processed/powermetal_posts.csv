"Last Performance - Under cover of Darkness","Considering the lack of an upvotes and no comments, I was expecting this to be poor.  Not bad, though.  Nothing great, but the decent production, decent symphonic elements, and great vocal melodies keep this song a bit interesting.  I just wish more was going on besides her vocals, plus I am not incredibly huge on her voice."

"Buying Different Formats of Music","With bands such as Blind Guardian, Orden Ogan and Nightwish releasing multiple versions of their new album, this brings up the biggest question; which one should you get?

Is there a difference between getting the standard version, the digipak version and the Earbook version other than price?

What of those who want vinyl? Do you get absolutely everything or are you fine with one format of music?

And as with the case of Orden Ogan, do you need superfluous items such as a bust or is it not needed?

This is mostly for my knowledge as I'm unsure on what to get for these bands."
"Buying Different Formats of Music","Get the one that has the most value to you."
"Buying Different Formats of Music","The differences depend on the specific product. For exampe, with Blind Guardian's new albums:

* There is the standard CD.

* There is the Digipak with a single bonus track.

* There is the earbook with two bonus tracks

* There is a deluxe earbook which also includes a vinyl with alternate mixes for two songs.

* There are various vinyl versions with a single bonus track.

Digipaks have a sturdier build than jewelcases, and earbooks are significantly larger and may contain more content.

Ultimately what you get is what has the greatest value to you."
"Buying Different Formats of Music","The only thing I'm confused on is what is the difference between the earbook and digipak versions? Is it one bonus track or is there another difference I am unsure of?"
"Buying Different Formats of Music","I usually buy digipaks, not a guy for vinyls. Whatever the nicest CD version is, I'll go for that.

If I REALLY like them I'll buy the japanese version for the bonuses (although im not sure if Blind Guardian does those...)"
"Buying Different Formats of Music","I'll buy the standard versions of the CDs, and if the bonus tracks impress me enough, I'll see if I can hunt down a download on itunes or amazon."
"Buying Different Formats of Music","I would recommend uncompressed (CDs, for example) for Nightwish and Blind Guardian. Compression like MP3 can take out a lot of the soundstaging. It wouldn't be bad for cheap speakers, but if you get higher-end headphones, you start noticing"
"What happened to the mod?","I noticed there is no mod box thing on the sidebar. What does that mean?

I went to internet archive and dialed a month back to see if the box was there and it was. /u/speakmouthwords still exists but it's not as /r/powermetal mod. http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/about/moderators This has nothing and it should show the subs moderators. Soooo, what gives?

**EDIT:** R.I.P /u/SpeakMouthWords. You were a good wizard, may your dreams be of dragons and epic crusades.

All hail /u/Edledhron! our new mod.

All hail /u/Mushmancat! our second new mod and prelude to madness.

All hail /u/Phyralis! our third new mod. Quite the crowd."
"What happened to the mod?","It seems that /u/speakmouthwords has stepped down. He sent out invitations to myself and three others, so who accepts among them will be your new mod team it seems. It is a bit of a sudden change, but we'll make sure that things continue to flow well. 


Edit: As far as the future goes...

1. I've stickied the latest power metal releases thread, so you all can enjoy that.

2. The power metal awards will continue operation soon, I'm just waiting to hear from our former glorious leader on where things currently stand for those.

3. With the other mods and with all of you, we can discuss what things you'd like to see in the future: more weekly threads? Making use of the subreddit wiki? Etc."
"What happened to the mod?","All hail the new king!"
"What happened to the mod?","It's for the best. Congratulations! :D"
"What happened to the mod?","I've moderated a subreddit of similar size.  

To warriors here, go easy on the mods.  They provide a service to you and are not paid.  If you have a request of the mods, do not create self posts saying something like ""I think we should have the mods do blah"" or ""I'm having some issue."" Instead, use the [message the moderators] link in the sidebar.

To the new mods, good luck, and don't let a handful of false warriors upset true metal.  Reddit's spam controls are decent, but not great.  Reddit administrators aren't helpful dealing with problem users."
"What happened to the mod?","Self-moderation has worked pretty well here so I would really only want to see faster reaction to spam and maybe a theme day every so often.

I hope you three have a bit thicker skin than it was shown many on this sub had a while ago"
"What happened to the mod?","There will be one more joining us, assuming he accepts the position.

Nothing too much will be changing. Like you said, self-moderation has worked well, and so long as it continues to work well action will only be taken against that content which really doesn't belong (spam, overly-aggressive unpleasantness, etc.).

Speaking personally, I would like to try out having more regular, 'official' posts (weekly threads, album discussions, etc.) That will depend on community reception though, but it's something to try out.

My current idea for the wiki is to move the essential album list and associated posts there, as I think that would be better organization-wise. We can try out some other stuff to flesh out the wiki as well.

Speaking of the essential album list, after the 2014 awards are over with, that being reexamined has been a popular topic, so I'd like to explore the extent to which people want to see it changed.

I think there's also a handful of users deserving of flair which can be addressed soon.

This has sort of turned into the 'future plans' post, but it's just a rough sketch of things I'd like to see. You guys and the other mods can chime in too! The basic gist is that /r/powermetal is going to remain the subreddit that you know and love, hopefully just with a few new bonuses too for subreddit enrichment -- and nothing's final. Once the dust has settled a bit, and the awards are over, we can discuss the matter more deeply."
"What happened to the mod?","oh, I also have a small specific request. If you could [update the stylesheet](http://www.reddit.com/r/powermetal/about/stylesheet) and add this line:

`.link .score.unvoted{color:#666666;}`

That would be great. The current unvoted score count is pretty hard to read, depending on the window size due to the background. This just makes it a bit darker. It fits nicely on line 167.

http://i.imgur.com/TEU50Lo.jpg"
"What happened to the mod?","Done."
"What happened to the mod?","Ahah - I thought something looked different!"
"What happened to the mod?","&gt;.link .score.unvoted{color:#666666;}

ah, the most metal of all hex color codes
"
"What happened to the mod?","you can actually just use `#666` and it'll still work"
"What happened to the mod?","I'd be interested in album discussions, maybe the top new release of the week? Although I feel like we could just end up with the same people, namely the more active/influential members of the community, doing most of the posting."
"What happened to the mod?","That's pretty much what happened the last time we had regular album discussions. However, we do have some more people now, and I think if the threads were 'stickied' they might have more success. I'll be starting them up after the awards are over."
"What happened to the mod?","More regular posts to instigate discussion would be fantastic.  The weekly releases is a great start, and I hope that continues (looking at you, UnlostHorizon!).  I love the idea of album discussions; a great start would be Beyond the Red Mirror.  A single thread for discussion of the album, with a suggestion that people sort comments by ""new"" to keep the discussion flowing.

I am not sure what the wiki might entail.  The problem with creating a wiki, in the traditional sense at least, is that there are so many other archives (Encyclopedia Metallum being a big one) that already have much of what is necessary.  The wiki pages would need to be unique, I.E. the essentials list, or maybe band history, or extensive lists of interviews, etc.


Re-examining the essentials list seems like a no-brainer to me.  Either it gets updated, and people are more content, or it stays the same.  Maybe some guidelines to suggestions, such as not albums you personally enjoyed, but albums that had an impact on the power metal world.

As for flair, I will be keeping an eye out, as well as Edledhron (he has already addressed a few) to see who is deserving of flair.  Contribute more and be a positive member, and your chances of receiving bad-ass flair increase!"
"What happened to the mod?","&gt;and I hope that continues (looking at you, UnlostHorizon!)

Unfortunately I don't think we'll be able to count on him for those. Unless someone else takes it over, I can start with those next weekend.

&gt;a great start would be Beyond the Red Mirror. A single thread for discussion of the album, with a suggestion that people sort comments by ""new"" to keep the discussion flowing.

Definitely agree with that. I'd like to get through the awards first though - that'll be a week or two depending on how voting goes. The good news is we already have over 100 submissions!

&gt;The wiki pages would need to be unique, I.E. the essentials list, or maybe band history, or extensive lists of interviews, etc.

That's what I'm thinking. The essential album list, pages for our past awards, links to the AMAs we've hosted, etc.
"
"What happened to the mod?","No no, we can't count on him - was just making a point, in-case he is lurking.

Aye, makes sense, though the magic of the new album might wear off a bit at that point.  Actually... it's Blind Guardian, who am I kidding?"
"What happened to the mod?","Maybe have some resources for finding new music. Sites like [this](http://www.music-map.com/blind+guardian.html) or [this](http://www.gnoosic.com/)."
"What happened to the mod?","What about work on a hall of fame similar to what /r/progmetal is doing?"
"What happened to the mod?","It's something we can bring up when we start having those discussions. Personally, I'm not in favor of that. I prefer an album-based approach, and their process is rather ...inefficient at producing a finished list."

"Review: Judicator – ""At the Expense of Humanity""","I read the review and heard the snippets, and it really did sound alot like Blind Guardian, but less ""adventure-y"". I had never heard of the band before. The cover art is also rocking, the use of only a few high contrast colours makes me think of the artwork on a KMFDM album (I know, industrial band, not metal). "
"Review: Judicator – ""At the Expense of Humanity""","The title track is one of my favorite tracks of 2015 so far. Looking forward to this one

EDIT: Also, someone in my family just heard they've got cancer (which is the subject matter of the album) and will probably be battling cancer for the next decade or so. He's religious and this album seems to have an at least slight religious undertone (e.g. ""God's Failures"" probably referring to a good man being struck with cancer). I just wonder if it's a good idea to get him this album or if it'll trigger shit."
"Review: Judicator – ""At the Expense of Humanity""","Sorry to hear about your family member. 

John Yelland isn't religious, so it's more likely to be critical of religious faith than anything. Probably not a great fit for someone who's religious."

"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","Awwww yissssss.

To this day, Emerald Sword remains my favorite song"
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","My favorite song and the one that got me into this genre"
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","If I were to choose my favorite power metal song of all time, this would definitely be the one. Either that or Wisdom of the Kings which coincidentally comes right after. "
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","I like you."
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","Exactly the same here!

I first got into power metal when I was wandering around the cd section of a large retail where I saw ""Symphonic of War"" by Magic Kingdom. 

""Pretty cool artwork"", I thought. I wrote down the name in my phone, came home and googled it. I ended up reading a review somewhere that mentioned ""Rhapsody of Fire"" and I clicked the youtube link for ""Emerald Sword"".

Then it all began. I liked that song so much that I all saw and heard for a week were motherfucking dragons and swords.

Symphony of Enchanted Lands is absolutely amazing!"
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","It really is a timeless classic. That and Holy Thunderforce are my favorite Rhapsody songs."
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","Holy Thunderforce will forever and always be my favorite Rhapsody song."
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","How could a power metal fan's favorite song not [be this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf2fCD1hrow)"
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","Imho, that's not even Pathfinder's best song. I mean, the instrumentation is absolutely fucking awesome, but it breaks all my windows!"
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","It's not everybody's taste really, I personally love it but I've heard people complain about the erratic changes in vocal pitch, which I get how some people could find it annoying."
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","It reminds me alot of the vocal style in Lost Horizon, which can only be a good thing imo."
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","Pathfinder imo is the band that comes closest to Lost Horizon, my favorite band of all time."

"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","Why have I never seen this before?!"
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","This was the first Power Metal Song i listened to by a band other then Dragonforce. Fantastic song, and I'll always remember this as the song that really brought me into the genre."
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","Everyone's favorite gateway into Power Metal! GLORIOUS!!"
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","Awesome to see how this song has brought so many people into Power Metal o.0 It wasn't the first PM song I ever heard, but it was the first one to make me wonder ""is this some kind of specific genre? Because I want more of this!"" "
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","Dawn of Victory was my first one. I used MSN at the time and there was a voice... emoticon (or whatever those were called) with the intro my teenager self randomly found. It went from ""this song is pretty cool"" to ""Rhapsody is awesome"" fairly quickly."
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","This was the first power metal song I've listened to and it was what got me into the genre (I was already listening to a lot of symphonic metal via Nightwish and Epica before though)."
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","Silent Dream by RoF brought me in, Dawn of Victory is what I found later, that song full out javeline threw me."
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","El classico"
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","Don't have time to listen to it before I sleep, but I'll always vote this song up. First thing at work tomorrow!"
"Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword","I also love the [acoustic version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o30a7PZgc9c) even though it's not by the band nor does it share the melody and it's really only the chorus"

"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","So here's the thing. I was going to make a 2014 in power metal thingie, but it would be extremely biased to bands I was looking into. This is what happened:

-In late 2013 I started editing power metal articles on wikipedia

-On the list of power metal bands, there was like 2 Canadian bands. I'm a Canadian guy, so I was interested in whether Canada really had any power metal. I started looking into newer bands (since most stuff on wikipedia is a few years behind unless it's super popular). 

-I actually found a handful of bands that were awesome, and that's when I added a couple of newer Canadian PM bands to Wikipedia. Been watching them over 2014 and a bunch released new material. Overall I'm pretty impressed. However, here I intend to talk about all of the bands I looked at, not just ones with new material.

So here's where I tell you about them, which ones I looked at, which ones were eh, which ones were great. But before that, I'll just point out other releases in 2014 that I particularly liked:

* Sonata Arctica - Pariah's Child
* Alestorm - Sunset on the Golden Age
* Noble Beast's self-titled debut

Anyways, let's get on with this. I'll put them in alphabetical order. Generally if I couldn't find their work on youtube, I didn't look into the band (so no split up 80s/90s bands unfortunately). Wall of text time!

"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","Great list and write up! Though did you forget a 'recommended' tag for Borealis? You, rightfully state them as being in the top five and give quite a bit of praise, but I didn't see them as being recommended."
"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","Whoops, sorry, wanted to post this quickly, now it's fixed."
"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","Awwww, thanks for the shout out with regards to Unleash the Archers.

The Samandriel one cracked me up. I met them on the first 70K cruise and they gave me a copy of 'Awakening'. I'm not ashamed to say that I use it as a coaster. Their keyboardist, however, is a super super cool guy and I'm pretty sure he's best friends with the guys in Viathyn, so if either ever gets big, I'd expect a tour with both of those bands."
"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","What about Kobra and the Lotus? I really liked [Soldier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEeJImSaaFo), and need someone to tell me if their other stuff is worth listening to."
"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","I saw them live in Toronto with arsis and sonata artica and wow they blew my mind. Blew my mind and the other two bands out of the water in my opinion they were amazing. Great with the fans after too, offering autographs, photos and just chatted with the fans. "
"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","Nowadays they've sort of just become standard heavy metal."
"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","The guitarist/singer/mastermind behind shadowblade has been playing for kobra and the lotus for a while."
"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","Thats fine. I didn't say they were bad. Just probably not what I'd recommend to PM people."
"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","I know. I was just throwing that out there for a fun fact I guess. :)"
"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","3 Inches of Blood is easily the best canadian metal band.  The squirrel vocals comment made me laugh though. "
"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","That's the only way I can describe it. I mean it still has good pitch, it's just so odd to me. I totally get why they are good, but I don't see many power metal fans being big fans of them.

Speaking of great canadian metal bands, I would say Rush (not exactly metal but idc), but if we're talking modern metal, I'd be one to say Protest the Hero has a lot of good stuff. I'm not exactly a fan of them, but they've got a lot of talent."
"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","Rush has had some songs straddle the line between hard rock and metal (BU2B) on the last few albums, it's kind of interesting."
"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","I've always been interested in discovering more Canadian music but didn't see this until today, so this is an awesome list. I'm currently going through it and really enjoying some of the songs you linked to. Very thorough with great commentary."
"Canadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)‏","Not sure id they are still active, but look up Forgotten Tales. Their debut album is quite good and I know that they have at least another one or two. "

"BLIND GUARDIAN - Beyond The Red Mirror - In The Studio (OFFICIAL TRAILER #6)","This will probably be an unpopular opinion but I'm honestly not all that impressed with the album, I liked the previous one much more. It has really good moments but all in all it's pretty average, and the overuse of backing chorus vocals was kinda annoying. It also lacked the pure metal energy of previous albums since they focused on the epic orchestral sound so much. I was expecting more songs like The Holy Grail.

I'd give the album a 6/10."
"BLIND GUARDIAN - Beyond The Red Mirror - In The Studio (OFFICIAL TRAILER #6)","Agreed. I thought it lacked the perfect mix of epic and agression from the previous album. There are some great moments in there and Twilight of the Gods is an absolute blast, but the rest didn't stand out all that much. Still a good album though."
"BLIND GUARDIAN - Beyond The Red Mirror - In The Studio (OFFICIAL TRAILER #6)","It will be an unpopular opinion because this subreddit sucks Blind Guardian's dick to hell and back. They're not infallible and this album shows it."

"What's your favourite power metal album cover art of this year?","Wow. So much quality. Now i can clearly see this Power Within logo, to the right from this guy brain."
"What's your favourite power metal album cover art of this year?","And the second one, to the left from his brain."
"What's your favourite power metal album cover art of this year?","The art really does match the album title, as well."
"What's your favourite power metal album cover art of this year?","It's kind of odd; on the whole, the cover looks *super* busy and hectic. But, if you know don't know what to look for, the space in between the band name and the title in the center is almost empty, and you snap to it.

I'm no artist, but I think that design choice does an excellent job drawing your eyes to the important parts of the cover before you go visually exploring the rest."
"What's your favourite power metal album cover art of this year?","I thought this album cover was one of the least interesting this year. It's kinda intricate I suppose but as far as pm artwork goes it's not all too inspiring. Come to think of it DF haven't had decent album art since Sonic Firestorm...and even then..."
"What's your favourite power metal album cover art of this year?","Edguy - Space Police, aka the album i hated then loved."
"What's your favourite power metal album cover art of this year?","I don't think I've loved a single Edguy release post Hellfire Club."
"What's your favourite power metal album cover art of this year?","I'm on mobile right now so I can't link to it, but for the love of Hansi, someone post the cover to *Fantasia* by Estate. "
"What's your favourite power metal album cover art of this year?","[Here you go!](http://i.imgur.com/AetRmf0.jpg)"

"[Savatagurday] Savatage- Edge of Thorns","This is the song that got me into Savatage. I think my brother or I downloaded this song from Limewire. I found the album at a record store a while later and bought it."
"[Savatagurday] Savatage- Edge of Thorns","One of the all time great guitar solos."
"Is it possible to buy a digital download of the earbook version of Beyond the Red Mirror?","I always just buy digital music, but can't seem to find the full 12 track version of Beyond the Red Mirror anywhere. I would hate to not be getting the full version of the album (plus the cooler artwork is nice), but I don't really want to order a CD either."
"Is it possible to buy a digital download of the earbook version of Beyond the Red Mirror?","I don't think so - you could always just buy the Deluxe album and find Doom through ""other"" methods. I don't think it's worth the $50 for a song that is just okay. I do wish that they would release a PDF of the earbook though, I would love to look at the art and read the story."

Edit: 3 weeks away today..."
"BLIND GUARDIAN - Beyond The Red Mirror - In The Studio (OFFICIAL TRAILER #5)","I don't think it's exaggeration to say that that's the best orchestration I've heard for a metal song ever. Sacred Worlds and Wheel of Time I already considered to hold the title of best symphonic metal songs, but it looks like the band has taken it to another level.

That sample at the end....!"
"BLIND GUARDIAN - Beyond The Red Mirror - In The Studio (OFFICIAL TRAILER #5)","That sample was very ""And Then There Was Silence"" ..I think it's safe to say they are going to epic our faces off."
"BLIND GUARDIAN - Beyond The Red Mirror - In The Studio (OFFICIAL TRAILER #5)","Maybe i'm getting too hype, but I have a feeling this could be as good, if not better than Nightfall. "
"BLIND GUARDIAN - Beyond The Red Mirror - In The Studio (OFFICIAL TRAILER #5)","Agreed, the parts they've shown so far have been unbelievably good.

hype"
"BLIND GUARDIAN - Beyond The Red Mirror - In The Studio (OFFICIAL TRAILER #5)","Impossible.

"Imperial Age - Anthem Of Valour. I'm in love with this violin",""
"Imperial Age - Anthem Of Valour. I'm in love with this violin","Gonna be honest, I was a little confused about the violin shoutout, but then I got to the solo....

I'm glad solo violin is growing in metal. Only other major example I can think of is the guest violin in Keldian - Sundancer, and of course the violin in the majority of Ne Obliviscaris' stuff.

But yeah, we need more."
"Imperial Age - Anthem Of Valour. I'm in love with this violin","I don't care what anyone says, that was a fantastic album. Also Battle Heart fucking rocks."
"Blind Guardian - The Script For My Requiem",""
"Blind Guardian - The Script For My Requiem","I love the transition from the thrashier sounding verses to the more melodic chorus. The glorious choir of Hansi's gives me shivers every time the chorus comes around."
"Blind Guardian - The Script For My Requiem","Far and away my favorite BG song."
"Blind Guardian - The Script For My Requiem","Over the span of their career I find it hard to pick *one* song that's my favorite, this is definitely one of the better though."
"Blind Guardian - The Script For My Requiem","ONe of my favorite songs of theirs. That opening riff is fucking awesome."
"Ragnarok Juletide - We Celebrate at Christmas Time",""
"Ragnarok Juletide - We Celebrate at Christmas Time","This is from the new English language album of the Finnish Raskasta joulua -project. It seems that everyone from Northern Kings is included with addition to some other singers from the Finnish power metal cream."
"Ragnarok Juletide - We Celebrate at Christmas Time","this is incredible"
"Battle Beast - The Band Of The Hawk",""
"Battle Beast - The Band Of The Hawk","Their songs about Berserk are really good "
"Battle Beast - The Band Of The Hawk","Man this album remains one of the best metal debuts in the last decade. How did they ruin it so badly with their two follow-up albums."

"Iron Mask - Holy War [5:14]. I'm still somewhat new to Power Metal and this has become my favorite song.","God, Goetz Mohre is such a fantastic vocalist.

That guy just needs to get on joining a new band, power metal needs his voice.

The band is otherwise a talented bunch of individuals. But mostly Dushan Petrossi, the guitarist. He's something of a Yngwie clone, but he's a good one."
"Iron Mask - Holy War [5:14]. I'm still somewhat new to Power Metal and this has become my favorite song.","Great album, good start to being ""new"""
"Iron Mask - Holy War [5:14]. I'm still somewhat new to Power Metal and this has become my favorite song.",":)"
"Iron Mask - Holy War [5:14]. I'm still somewhat new to Power Metal and this has become my favorite song.","My favorite Iron Mask song! I love how Petrossi goes all out in his playing in the ending. "
"Iron Mask - Holy War [5:14]. I'm still somewhat new to Power Metal and this has become my favorite song.","This whole album is golden. But i can't decide which song from this album is my favourite. Holy War or [Freedom's Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n45uDcnNTmk). Can't choose."

"Symphonity - Evening Star","Or a Judas Priest or Tyr cover :-)

Olaf Hayer sounds a lot like Kotipelto in parts of this song. Or maybe it's just me. Good find, you always post solid stuff."
"Symphonity - Evening Star","\m/

Big Olaf fan - he's criminalally underrated"
"Symphonity - Evening Star","Most of this album was gold. _Gates of Fantasy_ and _Bring Us the Light_ are probably my favorites."
"Symphonity - Evening Star","So, about power metal band names..."
"Symphonity - Evening Star","@/u/Snake_Byte you like pretty much every band I like man, haha. I didn't know any one else even knew about these guys. "

I end up following the history of musicians I wanna hear more from and these guys popped up way back thanks to Olaf."

"Light Bringer - noah (2011, Japan)","That is the best Japanese power metal I've ever listened too, I mean its the only Japanese power metal song I've heard but you know."
"Light Bringer - noah (2011, Japan)","I can't tell if that's a compliment for the song or a dig at it.

Either way, we all gotta start somewhere. "
"Light Bringer - noah (2011, Japan)","Already found my second one and I like that, seems like I'll be up all night find Japanese power metal :)"
"Light Bringer - noah (2011, Japan)","I wrote [this article](http://www.metal-observer.com/3.o/a-beginners-guide-to-the-world-of-japanese-power-metal/) last summer, and I think it's your best bet for getting into JPM. "
"Light Bringer - noah (2011, Japan)","Where 5150 at lol, I'm a new fan and I already think I know better than you."
"Light Bringer - noah (2011, Japan)","5150 is rather obscure compared to those bands in the list. Besides, I'm saving doujin and touhou bands for another article :P"
"Light Bringer - noah (2011, Japan)","It's unfortunate this band is on indefinite hiatus.

I'm sure that Fuki will continue to grace us with her fantastic voice in other projects, but losing Light Bringer, at least for a while, sucks."
"What are some songs about sunless worlds, and lands where the gods are gone?","This is for a D&amp;D project I'm working on. I can think of a few off the top of my head, Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods, and Rhapsody of Fire - Magic of the Wizards Dream. Might you fine folk assist me with some more?"
"What are some songs about sunless worlds, and lands where the gods are gone?","Blind Guardian - Mirror Mirror has a similar vibe to it, not sure about the gods aspect though."

"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","I've been thinking about this since it's now March. It might be a good way to introduce people to new bands and stimulate discussion. I don't know if something like this has been done in the past since I've only joined the subreddit in January. Would you people be interested? 

I understand these tournaments are essentially popularity contests, so it might be beneficial to pair the big names against each other (like Blind Guardian vs. Stratovarius) and smaller names against each other (like Almah vs. Shaman). I know sometimes people get upset that their preferred group might lose due to popularity (just look at the Ultimate-Guitar bracket contest lately), but we already exist in a subreddit of rare taste anyway, so I thought it would be interesting.

If anyone is interested, please post your ideas below. We could decide who does pairings, who sets up brackets, etc. Maybe the Mods could help too.

Just an idea. Thanks! 

Edit 1: How about we do two separate brackets? One for popular legends and another for underdogs? 

Angra, Avantasia, Blind Guardian, Dragonforce, Edguy, Hammerfall, Helloween, Iced Earth, Kamelot, Lost Horizon, Nightwish, Rhapsody of Fire, Sabaton, Stratovarius, Symphony X, etc. for popular.


Adagio, Albion, Altaria, Angel Dust, Aquaria, Armory, Brain Storm, Cellador, Excalion, Hammerforce, Labyrinth, Pagan's Mind, Powerwolf, Scelerata, Seven Kingdoms, Skywings, Stormwarrior, Tiluland, Twilight Force, Winterage, etc. for less popular


There are some bands where I don't really know where there popularity fall: Dark Moor, Dragonland, Falconer, Galneryus, Pathfinder, Nocturnal Rites, Theocracy, etc. 

Edit 2: Users have recommended albums instead. Should we do multiple albums my a single artist like several Blind Guardian and Stratovarius? You guys should list some albums for recommendation."
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","I like the concept, but Blind Guardian would inevitably win such a thing.

We could try best album of 2015 so far, then there's only a 90% chance Blind Guardian would win it."
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","BG in all 3 categories? lol ""THATS HOW GOOD THEY ARE"" "
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","It all depends how the brackets work. If you do it like NCAA, a band like Blind Guardian (obviously a #1 seed) would cruise to the finals facing weaker competition, whereas a band like Dark Moor would face stiffer competition.

Although, to make it easier (and actually get 64 entrants) we can do albums of bands, which would be more fun since some people have different opinions on albums of bands (Nightfall in Middle Earth is highly praised while Battlions of Fear is not)"
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","No lie....I honestly prefer Battalions of Fear. And its for the simple reason that there's not as many backing vocals in the choruses as there are in nightfall. I prefer to hear only one Hansi at a time... but going back to the subject, Albums&gt;Bands in general for brackets. "
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","I like it too for its simplicity and being more speedy and thrash like. I used it here as an example, so no hate."
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","Albums is a good idea, as the style of bands also progresses over time. Allows people to vote specifically for what they like, and it's easier to compare albums than it is bands and entire discographies."
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","I think we could make this a weekly/monthly sort of thing. Obviously, we couldn't call it march madness, but still. Like, one month we could do what OP suggested. One month/week we could just vote on our favorite albums from X band (Blind Guardian first, obviously. Also excludes Nightfall ;D)"
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","I'd be interested in seeing whether Blind Guardian or Sabaton would win.  I'd really like to see it though."
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","I think RoF would be up there too, though they don't technically exist any more."
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","eh, RoF would get stomped. They have popularity but not like BG or Sabaton."
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","I'm a huge BG fan myself. RoF would be a close second but you're probably right when you say they'd get stomped."
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","This is a good idea simply because you paired up two bands I'm familiar with and whose material I enjoy, but don't know which one I prefer (Almah vs. Shaman). It would be interesting to see where loyalties fall in difficult situations like that.

But man, where's all the USPM? Got to add some Crimson Glory, Heir Apparent, Liege Lord, Manilla Road, Virgin Steele..."
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","Probably put USPM in a separate category if we don't want it to get drowned..."
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","Personally, I am all over the USPM lately so my votes would likely be aimed in that direction more often than not.

Although I do see your point, much as I could pretend otherwise my vote is only worth one point. The USPM stuff would probably get drowned out without it's own category."
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","it's not even that it's worse, it seems there's just more of non USPM around here (or in general as well)"
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","Yeah it's just less-widely known or maybe less widely appreciated? I certainly didn't know it was a thing until maybe a year ago and that's pushing it."
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","We should keep popular albums and popular bands out. "
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","I'm thinking we could do this with a bunch of albums...

and then use it to construct the new essentials list?

(depends on what you think the purpose of the essentials list is. If it's the most popular stuff, this would obviously work. If it's more like ""mastery of the genre"" or whatever, popular vote might not be the best)"
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","as long as I can DDOS the voting with votes until the one i want wins

jks"
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","We'll be happy to run this - just a couple things:

1) Bands or albums?

2) How do we want the initial bands to be decided? And how many?"
"Should we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?","I'd say albums. People can spend a couple of hours listening and then vote, whereas bands are much harder to get a feel for.

Maybe a rule like only 2-3 albums per band allowed, so smaller/ newer bands aren't at a disadvantage."

You don't have to use tapmusic.net. If you're not using last.fm just say what stucked in your head this week. But I still highly recommend it, since it makes stuff a lot easier. Cheers!

"This week i've been listening to... #1","**[Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep1B_aIFPDE)** - This is still getting daily listens!

**[Orden Ogan - Ravenhead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZrT_w2TAIU)** - The reaction to this didn't seem to be that great, and it's not a fantastic album, but an enjoyable one.

**[Triosphere -- The Heart of the Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0)** - A favorite album from last year.

**[Kamelot - Silverthorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSylbQEHhVo)** - The recent Kamelot news has returned me to listening to this album. Love it, easily tied for best Kamelot album with...

**[Kamelot - Epica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO7r4Oc3gfk)** - Some fantastic and classic songs on this record.

**[Steven Wilson - Hand. Cannot. Erase.](https://soundcloud.com/steven-wilson/first-regret-3-years-older)** - Moving away from power metal now, this is the wonderful new solo album from prog rock maestro Steven Wilson. Seriously check it out.

**[Periphery - Juggernaut Alpha/Omega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sNIbcqxYL0)** - It's djent. It's pop. Some people find those things horribly offensive, but I enjoyed these.

**[Summoning - Old Mornings Dawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-wZTxJoDCQ)** - Quite a nice album. Very atmospheric."
"This week i've been listening to... #1","I was a little lukewarm on the new Orden Ogan at first, but it grows on me with each listen. I don't even mind ""Evil Lies In Every Man""'s intro anymore."

I can see you also listened to Noble Beast! Holy crap, I still cannot believe their awesomeness. This album is just sooo good, I almost hate myself for ignoring all the time until now.

I made a little visit to Dubsteb this week with Nero (is it even dubsteb?). Anyway, I knew them for quite a while and it was mainly the ""oh, I kinda miss these dudes"" factor that pushed me to listen to the whole thing and I have to say I enjoyed it more than I thought. It's badass. Well, apart from that, I discovered quite a few new Power Metal bands this week. Vorpal Nomad is the band of this dude who makes the covers of ALL Power Metal releases. You know exactly who I mean (*cough* hooded men *cough*).

I want to talk about the new Manilla Road. Please. It's out for more than two weeks now and nobody seems to care. It's a shame. the first half of the album is at least comparable with their old stuff. Seriously, give it a listen.

Edit: Also, Dragonsfire is an awesome neat Traditional/Power Metal band from Germany with cheesy coolness and good riffs and stuff. Enjoyed all of their stuff. Unfortunately their bassist and vocalist died last week, R.I.P. ..."
"This week i've been listening to... #1","So I'm going to post [my collage](http://i.imgur.com/jO3Ht0Z.jpg) once again, because why not. I was trying to get into Kamelot's other album than The Black Halo and no. It's not going to happen. The Black Halo is too good and I can't accept that their others album aren't even as half as good as Halo. You can also see Merging Flare here and I still can't get enough of this album. It's amazing. Wasn't expecting that much awesomeness from this band. Seventh Wonder is also my recent discovery and this album is sometimes too sad for me. Can't handle the feels sometimes. Ravenheart - Valley of the Damned is basically Freedom Call-ish band, but their debut is incredible and especially [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIGRof8l1HE).

"This week i've been listening to... #1","I'll listen to these albums again. Maybe something will break with me. But their first album is just bad. You can't deny it."
"This week i've been listening to... #1","first definitely is bad, but starting with The Fourth Legacy is where they got really good. Fourth Legacy, Karma, and Epica are all great albums (although I reckon Fourth legacy is the weakest), and are very similar in style to the Black Halo. I'd be surprised if you didn't like them"
"This week i've been listening to... #1","You were right. Karma is so damn good. Forever is my second favourite song from them now. Thanks!"

"This week i've been listening to... #1","**Orden Ogan - Ravenhead** makes me sad that I just got this album a week ago, but worth the wait. Catchy and fun, so I'm going back to listen to their older material and see if it can catch me.

**Edguy - Savage Poetry** remember when Edguy made amazing music? This album proves that Edguy was once on top of their game.

**Brainstorm - Downburst** always dig listening to these guys every so often and they've gotten a few more listens as of late with their style of PM.

**Demons and Wizards - S/T** amazing album. Not enough can be said about this album.

**Iced Earth - Framing Armageddon/Crucible of Man** these albums often get a bad rep, but I thoroughly enjoyed going back and listening to these back to back, much like Metal Opera I and II.

**Metallica - Kill Em All** sometimes you hear a song off of an album and you want to listen to the whole album. Great album and a rare album where there isn't a weak song on the album (except maybe the bass solo...)"
"This week i've been listening to... #1","Love this idea.

Here's [mine](http://tapmusic.net/lastfm/collage.php?user=Paranoid2028&amp;type=7day&amp;size=3x3&amp;caption=true) still very similar to last week overall.

Beyond the Space, Beyond the Time is still a daily listen at this point and Awakening the World and Tales of Ancient Prophecies get a couple of their tracks played every day at the moment too. In fact, it's a similar story with Symphony of War and Element pt1.

I gave The Last Sons of Perylin a spin the other evening. Not quite sure what i make of it though but i usually need a few listens before i decide whether i like an album or not.

I checked out the opening track on Cradle to the Brave and liked it but i didn't have time to listen to the whole album at that point and then i promptly forgot about it completely, so i'll have to get stuck into that fairly soon too.

Last couple of days i've had Battalions of Fear on because my Blind Guardian discography is basically just Somewhere Far Beyond, Imaginations From The Other Side and Nightfall in Middle Earth. I'm starting from Battalions of Fear and going through all the albums i don't have/haven't heard yet. I wasn't sure on Battalions of Fear after my first listen because it's quite different from the BG sound i was used to but, after a few more listens i definitely do like it.

And then Threshold, well, i think i listened to one of the songs on that album somewhere along this week so that'll be why it's up there. I don't think it's a fantastic album by any means but i do still enjoy it to some extent."

"This week i've been listening to... #1","My last.fm has been nonexistent since I switched to Google Music years ago.

I have been listening to Ascendia - The Lion and the Jester. It's one of the best symphonic metal discs I've heard in years. Those of you who like Kamelot/Serenity/Symphony X need to go hear this disc.

I've also been revisiting the Bruce Dickinson solo albums and the golden era of prog metal aka 93-98. Some stars from that era would be:

Empty Tremor - Apocolokyntosis

Mayadome - Near Life Syndrome

"This week i've been listening to... #1","I don't use last.fm or whatever makes those collages, but here is what i've been listening to the last week or so. 

**Power Metal**


[Noble Beast- S/T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPn2e5zG1Lk): My album of the year from last year and I don't see this not getting regular spins anytime soon.  Its just too good. 

[Visigoth- The Revenant King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvMGT4wZ1N0): Not quite Noble Beast's self titled, but this is damn close.  This is my early contender for album of the year.

[Savatage- Gutter Ballet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQZYTnxzeRk): A timeless album that should be owned by everyone. 

**Non-Power Metal**

[Black Crown Initiate- Song of the Crippled Bull EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZpm3-68xZo)- This has been on steady rotation for the last year and a half.  These guys should be on everyone's radar because they are fucking amazing. 

[Ensiferum- One Man Army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl0ptqc2Jss)- The overall album is pretty hit or miss, but Axe of Judgement is pure energy and I hope they play it live, because its going to be so much fun. 

[Lich King- Born of the Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb0D0-aMhpY)- Seeing these guys later this week, can't wait.   They get better with each album. 

[Aborted- The Necrotic Manifesto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFIDFsfa3F4)- They bring the brutality. "
"This week i've been listening to... #1","Savatage deserves a lot more love around here. I guess it's just because USPM in general is not that popular in this sub"
"This week i've been listening to... #1","Dunno, the fapping to noble beast is pretty high, and they're US"
"This week i've been listening to... #1","USPM isn't just about being from the US, its a style in of itself. Think more like old school Savatage, Jag Panzer, or Helstar. "
"This week i've been listening to... #1","I know that, I still class Noble Beast along those lines."
"This week i've been listening to... #1","Yeah the general riffing and aggression definitely is, though the vocals tend more to the European side of things. In any case their debut is excellent."
"This week i've been listening to... #1","We did have Savatagurday for a while, not sure what happened there. We could always do it again..."
"This week i've been listening to... #1","Savatage put out a new album???? Oh, it's Gutter Ballet. Still amazing an album, I gravitate towards Hall of the Mountain King more."
"This week i've been listening to... #1","Enjoy the Lich King show! I'm a longtime fan of theirs and only finally got to see them in 2013 (I think that's when it was) and it was both hilarious and brutal."
"This week i've been listening to... #1","I can't wait, I really hope they play predator."
"This week i've been listening to... #1","Ensiferum's new album is sweet. I just love when they're singing about decapitating, killing, pounding, smashing, slashing and also suffering, hate, revenge and other poetic stuff. That's how I like my folk metal."
"Sonata Arctica - GravenImage",""
"Sonata Arctica - GravenImage","Such an underestimated song.

It starts so slow and with such a calming melody and then you have the keyboard starting to support the song (3:52) and to just bring it back into the calm part. (5:05)

The song is so well written.... it was one of the reasons which made me buy the rest of their CD's.
That song and this one:

"
"Sonata Arctica - GravenImage","This song hooked me into sonata."
"Sonata Arctica - GravenImage","Lyrically one of my favorite Sonata Arctica song."
"[Savatagurday] Savatage - Gutter Ballet",""
"[Savatagurday] Savatage - Gutter Ballet","Their best album. "
"[Savatagurday] Savatage - Gutter Ballet","So, was the riff for Cliffs of Gallipoli actually ""borrowed"" from this song? I've heard it was, but they don't sound close enough to me."
"Dream Evil - Crusader's Anthem",""
"DragonForce - Fight To Be Free",""

"I love this song....I am blown away by the chorus every time I listen to it. Do you know similar songs you can recommend. Thx","The song actually sounded quite dumb at the beginning, but holy hell did it get epic.

A few songs that come into mind:

* [King of the Nordic Twilight, Luca Turilli](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyB-PsfqGG4). Check out the whole album
* [Luca Turilli's Rhapsody, Ascend to Infinity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa392iMvCcw) Most of the Ascend to Infinity Album
* [Newer Xandria albums](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GBcPMDqmdk)

"I love this song....I am blown away by the chorus every time I listen to it. Do you know similar songs you can recommend. Thx","I need to listen to it again......I am really not sure about his voice."
"I love this song....I am blown away by the chorus every time I listen to it. Do you know similar songs you can recommend. Thx","That was awesome thx 4 post.  I like Angra's Nova Era."
"Lost Horizon - Perfect Warrior",""
"Lost Horizon - Perfect Warrior","So good. It's a shame they only have two albums out."
"Lost Horizon - Perfect Warrior","Yeah a real shame. I don't get why Wojtek doesn't contact Daniel and ask him to do the vocals like he did for Harmony. He said numerous times that the third LH album is written, so contact him and pay him or include him in the profits of what the album makes. Make a kickstarter/indiegogo. Maybe i am oversimplifying this (most likely i am), but it's a shame just like you said."
"Hell's Guardian - Middle Earth [Lord of the Rings Metal Cover]",""
"Grave Digger - War God",""
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?",""
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","Just an FYI, this song has more than one male vocalist. Roberto Tiranti does the really impressive whistle register during the slow part of the song. "
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","so, in the beginning it's Pathfinders' vocalist? (first 30 seconds)"
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","The parts done by Pathfinder's singer are real, he can hit pretty high notes with his falsetto screams.  His head voice isn't bad either.  But the person singing during the slow part is Roberto Tiranti of Labyrinth fame.   He hits a B5 in his falsetto there.  

"
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","so in the first 30 seconds, where the vocals go really high it's pathfinders own vocalist and during the slow part it's Roberto Tiranti? or partly Roberto Tiranti, like, backing vocals?"
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","Yeah I'm pretty sure that's the vocalist of Pathfinder.  If you ever listen to  Fifth Element you can hear him showcase his range in a number of songs, the best one to hear is The Day I Turn Back Time where he hits B5 at the end.    If I recall in Beyond The Space, the only part where Roberto actually sings is in that one section..also another neat tidbit Bob Katsionis of Firewind plays the keyboards in the keyboard/guitar battle at the end of the song. "
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","forgive me but I don't really like firewind, I liked their songs but now that I know they can't play them live, I don't like the songs or the band anymore. Saw them live once and they were bad ... really bad. do you think I should give them another chance? I will check out fifth element with the song you recommended :D"
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","I don't generally like them either, I like some songs because of the instrument playing but other than that meh.  However Bob is pretty good, he has some good solo stuff. 

Also this is how they should have sounded live.   

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGykrC-I21A&amp;list=PLmn0MCbZJXT1R308DCtljjPxYDCDjmsZx&amp;index=5"
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","this sounds pretty neat! I saw them at graspop, 2009 or 2011, could be even both. The vocalist couldn't hit his high notes and the drums were really basic. the guitars were really good but the sound didn't come through good enough, perhaps because it was open-air. well the total package didn't sound as I was expecting, especially when you know they're really good on album"
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","Yeah wasn't them as much as the sound production and singing isn't always easy for everyone lol especially at those kind of venues..everyone is drinking etc.   Well if they drink that is. "
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","I think so, i heard someone talking about how this guy uses a whistle technique or something? can't remember"
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","whistle notes is a real technique, that's correct :) thank you for your comment. check out adam lopez, he hit the highest notes ever by a male singer, it's in the whistle register :)"
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","Yeah, I hear a B5 at like :26-:27 in. Is that Tiranti or Kostro though? 

I've honestly never given Pathfinder much of a chance after hearing their one single all those years back; wasn't impressed."
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","That's Kostro.  Someone told me that Roberto only sings in that one part. 

It's more believable if you listen to some other Pathfinder stuff where Kostro is the only one singing, he can hit the B5s too. "
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","Seems like Roberto is doing most of the heavy lifting on this one"
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","I have been able to hit every note in this song; the range is real, for sure.  However, how it sounds might have been given some help from the studio.  Between polish and echo, it helps the higher notes sound a lot more pure.  That said, maybe there are people that can sound like that - if I can hit those high notes with a struggle, I am sure there exist some people that can hit those high notes without said struggle.

"
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","thanks :) you must be pretty impressive if you can sing like this :D"
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","a bit too overproduced... and when you can no longer make out even a syllable, you're getting too operatic for metal, imo"
"Beyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?","Tiranti&gt;you. Buhlee dat. "
"Freedom Call - Island of Dreams",""
"Freedom Call - Island of Dreams","Just listened to this album this morning. Always enjoyable."

"Bane of Winterstorm - The Warlord's Last Ride","Pretty damn good. "
"Bane of Winterstorm - The Warlord's Last Ride","Aah man, can't wait till these guys put together another album!"
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost",""
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","This song is great when played on a CD, but seeing Russel Allen sing it live, now thats a life changing experience. I have always held the belief  that Symphony X is ten times better live than in album format."
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","I can only imagine the energy. I haven't seen them yet but they are near the top of my list of must-see bands. I love the *Live at the End of the World* album though, I play that over the studio releases. Hopefully they come to Australia. "
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","I'm not ashamed to admit that /u/ametalfellow and I may have sobbed a bit when Symphony X played this on the 70K cruise in 2014. The atmosphere during this song was ridiculous.

Russell dedicated the song to the band's very good friend and (former) sound guy, Nate. He mentioned that ""the last time we played this song, Nate was with us and now. . .he's no longer here. But we know he's on the ship watching over us. So this one's for you, Nathan."" That was a bit touching."
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","Truth. I was unabashedly crying for pretty much the whole song... and the ""Triumphant champion of Ithaca"" part of the odyssey, because duh."
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","Aint no shame in crying at a metal show. First time I heard hallowed be thy name live I was in tears. Eveeytime I listen to the Beast over Hammersmith version I get choked up at how perfect it is. "
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","Tears of mithril."
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","Well shit. I can't just walk into /r/powermetal and see this without stopping to listen.

Holy fuck what an amazing song. If you were to ask me what my favorite song was, I'd have to say this."
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","Eve Of Seduction from the same album is absolutely my favourite from Symphony X. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbTSLVx7dgE"
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","I always thought that guitar riff in the beginning is amazing, but sounds even better when it starts up again after the chorus. "
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","Love that one, such raw intensity"
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","This was the music that brought me to Power Metal after branching out a bit from Dream Theater in high school.
Thank you for posting."
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","Same here! Metallica ----&gt; Dream Theater ----&gt; Symphony X and the world opened up after that. I am very fortunate to have seen Symphony X live twice. And the fact that Russell Allen can sing live just how he does on albums blew my fucking mind. "
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","Holy hell, are you me? This is pretty much the exact route I took between high school and now. Unfortunately, I haven't had the chance to see Symphony X live yet, but would've killed to see them on tour with Dream Theater."
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","You're welcome!"
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","That bridge has one of my favorite Russell Allen vocal performances ever. So many emotions. All the emotions."
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","This is probably one of my favorite albums ever and definitely my favorite song from the album. Incredible."
"Symphony X- Paradise Lost","I love how people have this assumption that anything heavier than Metallica must be black or death metal and then I show them stuff like this and say it was composed by a metal band, and a damn good one at that. 

I love shredding solos and thundering drum parts, but there is something about slower ballad-type songs that just really hits home when they're so well-done. 

The lyrics are spot-on if you've read Paradise Lost, too. As a British Literature major in college, that scored huge points with me. "

"Sabaton - Smoking Snakes| | Sent over seas to be cast into fiyah; Fought for a purpose with pride and desiyah","Went to their gig in London recently. Went with a Brazilian guy who was hoping for this to be played (because it's about the Brazilian Expeditionary Force) and a moment came where a random crowd member had to choose between this song being played next and Lion From the North. This got chosen and we lost our freakin minds :)"
"Sabaton - Smoking Snakes| | Sent over seas to be cast into fiyah; Fought for a purpose with pride and desiyah","Going to their concert in a month. Can't freakin' wait."
"Sabaton - Smoking Snakes| | Sent over seas to be cast into fiyah; Fought for a purpose with pride and desiyah","Every time I see lyrics for this song, it has the line ""Cobras Fumantes, viva esta su memoria"" (Spanish for ""Smoking Snakes, alive is their memory"") at the end of the pre-chorus.

But it sounds so much like he's saying ""Cobras Fumantes, eterna e sua vitoria"" (Portuguese for ""Smoking Snakes, eternal is their victory""). Which makes less sense, given that they eventually lost. Still, it's all I can hear when I listen to that line."
"Sabaton - Smoking Snakes| | Sent over seas to be cast into fiyah; Fought for a purpose with pride and desiyah","Yes, the correct line is ""Cobras Fumantes, eterna é sua vitória"". From the video's comments, 

*The confusion with the phrases: ""Eterna é sua Vitória"" and the phrase that appears in the CD booklet, ""Viva está sua Memória"" is that originally, the phrase that came out in the booklet was the first choice, but the band changed the phrase sung to the music as it sounded better, and the company behind the booklet did not change at the end, so the phrase went wrong in the official letter.*"
"Sabaton - Smoking Snakes| | Sent over seas to be cast into fiyah; Fought for a purpose with pride and desiyah","They lost? Nope, they didn't. Brazil helped in the invasion of Italy, and the Allies succeded.

Maybe you're talking about the specific skirmish between the Nazi and the Drei Brasilianischen Helden, so yes, in this case they lost.

And yep, the line is ""Cobra Fumantes, eterna é sua vitória"""

"New release: Engage - Don't Turn Back (Deluxe Edition)","Hey everybody!

I was in a band back in the mid 2000s called Engage and we played around Virginia, USA for a little while.  We recorded 2 times during our stint together and I just released all of our tracks so that they're available on spotify, Amazon, Google play, iTunes etc...

The style is Power Metal of course, very fast, melodic with clean high vocals, lots of double bass, lots of shredding and harmonized sweeps and what not.  

Please check it out and let me know what you think, I hope you enjoy!

We do not still play together, we all kinda moved on to other stuff.

We just purchased equipment here and there, read a lot and just played around with mixing until we got a good sound.

I know why they do it (it's discussed all the time), but I really hate all these ""bonus tracks"" bands release on different versions of albums.  All I want is your music - why won't you just give it all to me for one price?  Even as much as I love Blind Guardian, I don't know if I'd buy the same album twice for one extra song."

I told you this already but apparently you can't comprehend it with your mushy brain: Cheesiness is the main ground on which GH is being criticized. We're only deeming that argument invalid because this ""cheesiness"" is intended and quite enjoyable if you can appreciate that. By making fun of what those people are saying, you're technically making fun of yourself, because it is your own argument to begin with, we merely turned it around.

- Reasoning: Cheesiness is a determinant of musical quality

**Argument B**:  
- Gloryhammer is good because they're cheesy  
- Reasoning: cheesiness is a determinant of musical quality

Both arguments use the exact same reasoning. First saying A then making fun of B is essentially to make fun of your own reasoning.

Both arguments are equally flawed. "

"Gloryhammer - Angus McFife (just found this band, where were they hiding?)","So why this discussion? Other people have said they have more merit than their cheesiness.

"Gloryhammer - Angus McFife (just found this band, where were they hiding?)","Haha, I will whole heartedly agree that such reasoning is terrible. I have never understood it as reasoning nor have I ever used it myself.  

I think this album only has 1 great song, and 1 good song, and for much more logical reasons. 

The great being The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee. This is a solid power metal song and I feel it is hard to disagree. It may be generic, but generic does NOT equal bad. This is very well done generic. It has a nice galloping intro and verse, and the chorus contains very catchy melody lines with great keyboards and unarguably amazing vocals. The guitar solo is also the best on the album.

Angus McFife follows under nearly the same thoughts. The only difference is minus the guitar solo. Once again. Catchy, generic, strong vocals, and decent instrumentation.

After these the album falls off hard, being less catchy with less inspired instrumentation while continuing the generic path. 5/10 is a very fair score for this album.

The fact that every positive comment involves this band not taking itself seriously is cringe worthy and everyone who commented as such should feel bad.

All of this said, between their instrumental potential, their solid production, the fantastic vocals and the occasional nice melody lines, I AM interested to see what they do next."
"Gloryhammer - Angus McFife (just found this band, where were they hiding?)","I really like Amulet of Justice and I'm not sure why, maybe it's because in this fictional world there's an amulet FOR JUSTICE and it has its own destiny. It's also a really fast song which I love."
"Gloryhammer - Angus McFife (just found this band, where were they hiding?)","In my defense, the nonseriousness is only one of my main reasons for liking Gloryhammer, I didn't feel like listing them at length. I find the lead singer's vocals to be enjoyable, he hits some great notes, like some of the powermetal greats can. I like their guitar tone, the tempo to their songs, and believe it or not, the story content. It's poorly written from an English standpoint, but I find that endearing for the most part.

"Gloryhammer - Angus McFife (just found this band, where were they hiding?)","I like that they sing about undead unicorns"
"Gloryhammer - Angus McFife (just found this band, where were they hiding?)","From what I've listened to of Gloryhammer so far, it's either:

1. overly standard chorus/verse/chorus power metal with nothing interesting for me

2. playing as if they wished they were rhapsody

As for the lyrics being cheesy, i don't have a real problem with that, but the lyrics being interesting are usually the only thing that redeems otherwise nothing-special songs instrumentally. In this case, I couldn't really call the lyrics interesting.

Also, for Angus McFife, I can't help but say I'd rather just listen to a more energetic version of the pre-chorus and chorus in an extremely-structurally similar song: [The Quest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KHzN0XOn6A#t=63)"

I'm just don't get why this bothers you. The way I'm reading this--and if I'm wrong, please elaborate--is that people should admire or appreciate the simple fact that a goal was accomplished, regardless of their opinion on the means used to achieve that goal."
"Gloryhammer - Angus McFife (just found this band, where were they hiding?)","Like I said it depends how they present their feelings. Saying they dont like it and presenting their opinion as fact are pretty distinct. And whether they can appreciate it regardless of liking it is really all about the person.

"Gloryhammer - Angus McFife (just found this band, where were they hiding?)","Ugh. I'm so tired of people using ""cheesy"" as a blanket term to defend any and all power metal. It doesn't mean anything.  It adds nothing to the discussion, its just something power metal fans throw out just because they can. 

As for haters gonna hate, I don't even completely hate this band like Twilight Force.  I don't even hate them.   I think I gave them a 5/10 on their last album.  The singer is great, but the music is so generic and pointless.  "

You can't really deride folk-inspired music for having grammatically incorrect lines, since folk-music is often intentionally grammatically incorrect as a sociopolitical statement, i.e. an expression of solidarity with the ""common folk"" who, at the roots of folk music, were not entirely literate. So these ""bad lyrics"" are part of GH's lyrical persona."

"Looking for Suggestions - Power Metal With Backbone?","Greetings.

Power metal is perhaps my favorite genre of music. While I am a fan of many genres, the sheer strength and energy of power metal has entranced me since I first listened to Dragonforce and Rhapsody in high school. I have gathered a few preferred bands over the years, but now I want to expand my horizons beyond casual listening.

However, I have one big itch that few bands can scratch. Few of them have any depth to their music. Most songs don't escape vague epic fantasy platitudes. Dragonforce is the worst example of this, but I'd say it extends to most acts, even ones I love. Rhapsody of Fire's 10-album story, while ambitious, doesn't escape fantasy tropes. The lyrics lack weight for me - its the music itself that carries the song. The same can be said from what I've seen of Blind Guardian, Stratovarius, Nightwish, and most others. 

So, what bands or albums break the power metal sterotypes? Which ones explore tougher emotions like fear and sadness, or tell unique stories? It'd be fine if some non-power metal bands/albums were listed, too, as I've been wanting to check those genres out (I've recently listened to Ayreon's The Human Equation and was very impressed). 

Thanks for all the suggestions."
"Looking for Suggestions - Power Metal With Backbone?","&gt;The same can be said from what I've seen of Blind Guardian

I'm sort of surprised that you would say this of Blind Guardian. They are largely inspired by fantasy, but their lyrics deal often with the best of fantasy literature, along with mythology and similar topics. Hansi very often does a great job of conveying the emotion behind these works - he isn't just making bland use of fantasy tropes. Furthermore, he often does branch out from these themes. A Night at the Opera has songs about Galileo and Nietzsche. A Twist in the Myth has songs about personality disorders and dreams. Religion and science fiction are common themes throughout their albums, and At the Edge of Time has a song about a political treatise in the context of the English Civil War. Even when dealing with fantasy or mythology, Hansi usually is able to bring in some new perspective - for example, 'Under the Ice,' a song about a story from Greek mythology, contains heavy feminist themes. No, he's not Shakespeare, but I'd say his lyrics are easily among the best in the genre. 

And I'd say the same thing about Nightwish as well. Yes, they've also delved heavily into fantasy. But their songs also extend well beyond that, and if you pay attention to the lyrics there's a lot of emotional depth to them. They certainly shouldn't be included with the likes of DragonForce or Rhapsody.

All that said, I would recommend checking out Angra, Dark Moor, Edguy, Kamelot, Demons &amp; Wizards, Disforia, Judicator, Sonata Arctica, Keldian, Masterplan, Symphony X, Falconer, and Triosphere.


Since you brought up Ayreon's The Human Equation, I'll recommend a few prog metal bands you'd probably like as well:

Seventh Wonder, Haken, Porcupine Tree, Devin Townsend."
"Looking for Suggestions - Power Metal With Backbone?","The Wicked Trilogy by Avantasia is a fairly abstract trio of concept albums, which may be what you're looking for. the music is somewhat in the vein of Ayreon too so there's a good chance you'll like them"
"Looking for Suggestions - Power Metal With Backbone?","Was gonna say Avantasia.  Or Edguy. 
If you're looking For deep meaning, i highly recommended Dream Theater. They'll blow your mind. 
Some other favorites include Kamelot, Demons &amp; Wizards, Nocturnal Rites to name a few."
"Looking for Suggestions - Power Metal With Backbone?","I love all the bands you mentioned, so definitely good choices, although not sure about nocturnal rites with regards to their lyrics"
"Looking for Suggestions - Power Metal With Backbone?","Ya I guess. Still an amazing band. I Kind of ventured away from the story telling aspect he is looking for. 
First band that comes to mind is Blind Guardian. They have some great tales Haha."
"Looking for Suggestions - Power Metal With Backbone?","You listened to Sabaton?

They sing about War.

Mass human loss and suffering is pretty substantial I think, more than fantasy settings.

If you're looking for some philosophical symphonies from the Plato of Power metal, however, I'm not sure I can help."
"Looking for Suggestions - Power Metal With Backbone?","I'm personally a fan of the darker power metal, both in lyrical content and in heaviness of music.

&gt;The __7 July 2005 London bombings__ (often referred to as __7/7__) were a series of coordinated [suicide attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack) in [central London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London), which targeted civilians using the [public transport system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_in_London) during the morning rush hour.

&gt;On the morning of Thursday, 7 July 2005, four British [Islamist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamist) men detonated four bombs—three in quick succession aboard [London Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground) trains across the city and, later, a fourth on a double-decker bus in [Tavistock Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavistock_Square). As well as the four bombers, 52 civilians were killed and over 700 more were injured in the attacks, the United Kingdom's worst terrorist incident since the 1988 [Lockerbie bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockerbie_bombing) as well as the country's first ever suicide attack.

&gt;The explosions were caused by homemade [organic peroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_peroxide)–based devices packed into [backpacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpack). The bombings were followed two weeks later by [a series of attempted attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_July_2005_London_bombings) which failed to cause injury or damage.

"Looking for Suggestions - Power Metal With Backbone?","Sonata Arctica has plenty of song on deeper subjects, like Tallulah which is about leaving someone you love because you fear what it will be like if the relationship goes on and the love begins to dwindle. Or Letter to Dana, which is about a former friend/love who ran away from home and seeing them on the cover of a porn mag years later. ""Tony"" (quotes because it's not really Tony in the song, i'll just use him as an insert since he's the singer) then goes on about how he hoped she would come back (seemingly still loving her) until the porn mag incident, which killed the last of his love.

Those are just two examples, there's plenty more songs from them that are deep. (What did you do in the war, dad? Love kind of counts, I have a right is about the children's right to a proper education, Alone in heaven questions Christian beliefs about heaven... I could go on and on, you get the point)

Sabaton sings about historic events, like the World War II, the life of king Karl (Charles/Carolus) the XII (Carolean's prayer, Carolus Rex, Long Live the King and Ruina Imperii at least tell about his and his soldiers life).

Alestorm tells about the hardships as well as the glory of being a pirate. (Shipwrecked tells about exactly that, Midget saw tells about a man who had his limbs cut off for beating a monkey to death. [Quite psychotic reasoning to be honest, but when were pirates known for their mental stability] Barrett's privateers tells about privateering during the American Revolution and the hardships that brought to the singer.)

Sentenced has/had (as the band has been disbanded forever after Miika Tenkula died of a heart attack [from a hereditary heart disease], and the band had quit in 2005 officially, but some people were somewhat still holding out for a re-union) plenty of songs about death, suicide, depression and other such dark matters. (their first few albums are more death metal, but after the third or so i'd place them as a heavy power metal band).

Ari Koivunen's Angels are calling is seemingly about losing his little sister who was only 12 at the time of her death. (Ari has said that it's not specifically about her, and that everyone can fit their own story into it, but it's clear that it's more or less about his sister.)

Tarja's (Tarja Turunen) Boy and the ghost tells about a dead boy and (seemingly possessed by) a ghost. The boy seems to have been mistreated as the song sings about how ""all he needed was a gentle heart to guide him trough the dark"" and is now seemingly terrorising the town.

Poisonblack, the more or less spiritual successor of Sentenced, has very similar themes to the singer Ville Laihiala's previous band (Sentenced) of death and other darker subject matters.

**TL;DR**

There is plenty of power metal with a spine and darker/mature subjects, you just have to dig a little bit.

But please, do read the whole thing, it took quite a bit to write. And the bands are just from my spotify playlist, i'm sure there's plenty more songs and bands like the ones mentioned."
"Looking for Suggestions - Power Metal With Backbone?","&gt;Most songs don't escape vague epic fantasy platitudes. ... The same can be said from what I've seen of Blind Guardian, Stratovarius, Nightwish, and most others. 

What exactly would you consider deep then? Admittedly most of eg Blind Guardian is tales of fantasy worlds, but does that necessarily mean the theme of the song is 'shallow?

Would you eg consider Sabaton deep when they sing about the psychic stress and depravities of actual wars, but not another band if they sung about the same, but from a fantasy world?"
"Looking for Suggestions - Power Metal With Backbone?","While admittedly Blind Guardian does have more to offer in terms of different themes than the average power metal band, none of their songs effected me on a personal level. I find the singer doesn't portray strong emotions well, and the lyrics are too vague, often based on works I've never read. I can see why they have their fans, but one song just slips to the next when I listen to their albums."

"Kamelot officially reveals new album ""Haven""","I find, for me, the magic is gone from Kamelot after Roy left. I like Silverthorn, but it doesn't have the appeal of Roy's albums. I still wish them well, and think Tommy is a great singer.

*EDIT: I should add that I am excited to hear this new album."
"Kamelot officially reveals new album ""Haven""","What were your thoughts on GO/PftP? I think the ""magic"" was waning already. I enjoy everything GO and on, but the only really ""magical"" Kamelot albums, in my opinion, are Epica+TBH. Again, I hold the other albums dear to my heart, but when I sit back and think about it, Epica+TBH are the true masterpieces which outshine and inflate the perceived value of Kam's discography.

I'm falling asleep so I have no idea what I'm rambling about. I love Kamelot then and now, that's all I know haha."
"Kamelot officially reveals new album ""Haven""","Yeah, I think Black Halo was Roy's last best album. Every damn song on that album is fantastic. GO/PftP are really great though. "
"Kamelot officially reveals new album ""Haven""","I think I'd include Karma on that list of magical albums as well. "
"Kamelot officially reveals new album ""Haven""","*Karma* had the beginnings of the band's magic, and nearly every song is perfection, but in its entirety it doesn't match the next 2 for me. Very close though!"
"Kamelot officially reveals new album ""Haven""","Roy, Where are you when people needs you? Why are you doing this to us?! I feel pain!"
"Kamelot officially reveals new album ""Haven""","**Raises glass of blood to the sky** cheers, my friends! **Drinks.**"
"Kamelot officially reveals new album ""Haven""","I'm thinking about getting the deluxe version with the instrumentals. Did anyone do that for Silverthorn? How were those just as instrumentals? Maybe I could at least jam some guitar over it.  "
"Kamelot officially reveals new album ""Haven""","The instrumentals on Silverthorn were disappointing because they didn't cut all the vocals out of them. They cut out Tommy's, yes, but all of the background vocals were left in, and it was really distracting. Hopefully they fix that this time."

"Where is Szymon Kostro(ex-Pathfinder)?","I have no idea, but you might want to try asking the Pathfinder Facebook page. I know Arek (Arkadiusz) and Karol are pretty active posters, especially now with the crowdfunding deal. Try asking them if Szymon's doing alright and if he's in any new projects...that sort of stuff."
"Where is Szymon Kostro(ex-Pathfinder)?","Prior to Pathfinder, Simon has put out two albums, one with *Privateer* and one with *Scrat*. The former is heavy/power, the latter is trash metal."
"Where is Szymon Kostro(ex-Pathfinder)?","&gt; the latter is **thrash** metal

Why do so many people think it's spelled without the ""h""? Don't make the obvious joke!"
"Where is Szymon Kostro(ex-Pathfinder)?","I honestly though the genre was called trash metal. But now that you say it, it occurs to me that they're *thrashing*

It also took me years to realize that the Pokemon move Thrash was not called Trash and had nothing to do with garbage. I literally thought they would throw garbage at the enemy, I kid you not."
"Where is Szymon Kostro(ex-Pathfinder)?","&gt; I literally thought they would throw garbage at the enemy, I kid you not.

I was like that as well, until I stopped sucking at English.

Thrash isn't exactly a word you just pick up from watching TV, since nobody *really* uses that in every day speech.

On a side note, though. The move Gunk Shot is exactly that. In Generation 6 games, the animation is literally throwing a garbage can at the enemy."
"Where is Szymon Kostro(ex-Pathfinder)?","Yeah, exactly. The phrase ""thrashing about"" also had me confused to think it meant throwing garbage around, lol.

Hah, Pokemon games are really running out of ideas! Haven't played anything past 3rd gen. "
"Where is Szymon Kostro(ex-Pathfinder)?","I thought sweat was pronounced ""sweet"" when I read books as a child, and I never understood what the hell it was. ""Why was he covered in sweet? The hell is that?""

"Where is Szymon Kostro(ex-Pathfinder)?","Ahah, covered in sweet! That's gold."
"Where is Szymon Kostro(ex-Pathfinder)?","..."
"Where is Szymon Kostro(ex-Pathfinder)?","What's the matter?

If you're bothered that I thought thrash metal was called trash metal, that's just an oversight on my part.

If you're bothered that I didn't know that trash and thrash were two different words when I was 10 year old non-native English speaker, I don't know what to tell you."

For me, that is not the problem at all, but one of the saving graces.  The album is not bad by any means, but it is overly generic without being memorable enough.  There were a couple of good songs, but the album is only really worth it if you really like the generic style of straight-forward fantasy power metal."

"[Meta] This place likes Blind Guardian, doesn't it?","Sabaton snubbed yet again!"
"[Meta] This place likes Blind Guardian, doesn't it?","Given it's the release month for a new album (a rare occurence), and they did an AMA, it's not too bad. And if the subreddit is going to circlejerk around bands, it's nice that at least one of them can produce top tier songwriting."
"[Meta] This place likes Blind Guardian, doesn't it?","While I think it's true, and this place ends up being BG circle jerk sometimes, that's not really a problem. Every genre is going to have its flagship bands, and that's cool. BG is by far the most popular power metal band; even the people at r/Metal who think power metal is gay will listen to a BG song or two.

Having flagship bands is a fine thing; that's why r/Metal has a blacklist (and BG is on it by the way). But r/PowerMetal couldn't have a blacklist (nor does it need one at all), mostly because it would just feature the popular bands (BG, Stratovarius, Sonata Arctica, Lost Horizon, Helloween, Edguy etc) and would basically kill participation on the subreddit (just speculation, altogether we're not too bad at posting the same bands over and over again)"
"[Meta] This place likes Blind Guardian, doesn't it?","You're talking about a subreddit where a band released a single song in 2014 and won best song and best singer of 2014. Nope, nothing circlejerky about that, no rampant fanboyism here. "
"[Meta] This place likes Blind Guardian, doesn't it?","Its not just BG. BG and Sabaton are the only bands that get any attention here"

"[Meta] This place likes Blind Guardian, doesn't it?","I dislike Falconer. But only the singer."
"[Meta] This place likes Blind Guardian, doesn't it?","'Best song' is a category for a single song. If that's the song that people felt was the best released in 2014, why shouldn't they vote for it? Likewise, if people felt that Hansi's live and recorded vocal performances were the best the year had to offer, why shouldn't they vote for it? And don't tell me that that comes anywhere close to awarding 'best lyrics' to Sabaton in terms of a circlejerk."
"[Meta] This place likes Blind Guardian, doesn't it?","Even I think Twilight of the Gods was one of the best songs of the year. And I totally agree that Sabaton shouldn't win any rewards for their lyrics.

That said, I wonder how people would feel if I said Jorn was the best vocalist of the year because of those two Pentakill songs he did."
"[Meta] This place likes Blind Guardian, doesn't it?","If that's your opinion, I see nothing wrong with that. People just seem to be annoyed that popular choices are winning a popularity contest."
"[Meta] This place likes Blind Guardian, doesn't it?","I wonder how people would feel about the annual awards being determined by some sort of award panel rather than by a community vote. People would lose their chance to participate, but the resulting awards would probably make more sense."
"[Meta] This place likes Blind Guardian, doesn't it?","The awards ultimately are and should be a community-driven event. Having a panel would destroy that, and it would be a symptom of people taking the awards more seriously than they should be. No, we aren't deciding in objective terms which are the best of each category - we're putting things to a popular vote for, hopefully, fun.

Given the reaction to this year's awards, my current thoughts are to have two awards (one open to all bands, and one with the most popular bands excluded), and to make everything tied to albums."

&gt; UM: Do you mind sharing the song titles of the songs you have written so far?  
SW: One song that is not really power metal is called ""Basten to the Floor"", it's a very catchy song. ""Lament of the Minstrel"" and ""Enter the Glade"" are two other songs. Actually, I am not sure if you can say ""Basten to the Floor"". Can you say the word basten in that sentence?  
UM: No but you could say ""Beaten to the Floor""

"Falconer - Busted to the Floor [4:16]","This is kind of the only non-perfect song on what is otherwise a perfect album. Just a horrible way for it to end.

It just so happens that Japanese melodeath tends to be very power metal-y in nature. For example, [here's another Japanese melodeath band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj7bzbGOI-I) who just recently put out their debut EP.

For anyone interested Gyze have a [new album coming out in February](http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/VICL-64303). They usually get Claudio from Disarmonia Mundi to do some vocals too, so if you like them, check this out."

**~~SinuataBouquet's~~ UnlostHorizon's Recommendation of the Week**

I still don't know where /u/SinuataBouquet is (probably recovering from a killer hangover), so I'm filling in for this week again. Hopefully he comes back...so he can enjoy the new **Jupiter** release. How's that for a segue? A decent number of tracks from the album have already been released as part of singles over the last year, and it's shaping up to be a great album as always. If you don't like Japanese power metal, then you don't deserve to get a recommendation from me. Here are some other Jupiter songs appearing on the new album:

""[Last Moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4t_P6kKXEk)""  
""[Luminous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NJb6mUiKyY)""  
""[Arcadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xQM778WyeE)""  
""[Darkness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9-2eCLNAAs)""  
""[氷の中の少女](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8_S7jEaWBs)""  
""[Sacred Altar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swPsteGfm8I)""

I expect a /u/MisterMillennia write-up on all of these tracks due by the end of the week.

**EDIT:** I just added the Rainbowdragoneyes release. I feel like it deserves a spot on this list."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","With a name like Rainbowdragoneyes, I just had to click. I think I'm liking this?"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","Of course you like it. Check out *The Primordial Booze* if you want some more original songs he did. They're absolutely fantastic, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28aCLTrYBnY)."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","I am SO happy to see that Rainbowdragoneyes is getting some love in this subreddit, I have been a huge follower of his since his first EP, and this new EP is just awesome

I also met Eric (His real name) when I saw him play live in London with Alestorm, he is the coolest dude you would ever want to meet, I bought one of his shirts and a cassette of his newest album (which by the way, is amazing)"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","One of the bands they covered (Lagerstein) are from my town way down in Australia and are the coolest dudes. They're great friends with Alestorm and go on many wonderful adventures with them (and Gloryhammer as well, since Chris takes them everywhere).

Check them out if you like drinking and pirates. They run a hell of a show."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","Dethlehem going hard for that worst album of the year award. "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","Is the band supposed to be satirical e.g. the Gloryhammer of Epic Melodic Death Metal and if so is it still satire if its not funny?"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","Yes to both.

Just look at Gloryhammer."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","An army of undead unicorns is *kinda* funny."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","Hey guys, I'm taking a real quick break from studying for my exam to do this, so I may not be as thorough as usual. Regardless.

My opinions (based on previews only):

- **Dethlehem:** Holy shit, am I agreeing with /u/mushmancat on something? Yes. Yes I am. Instrumentally pretty decent at times, and completely aimless and crappy at others. Vocally decent, but not very memorable. Overall, this wasn't all that impressive unless you are impressed by how shit the music video is.

- The **Musara** video is not available for me, so I dunno what's going on there.

- **Jupiter:** I'm honestly surprised this was so long. Normally, all JPower previews are 1'30"", and any compilation sets are 5 seconds of each song packed into that timeframe. This one was 11 minutes of goddamn glorious JPower. Speaking of the music itself, there is some ridiculous range on their music, going from the traditional JPower light and fast, to the brutal speed/thrash, to the Death-Power (was that even a fucking thing before that song?), to the slow balad, to I don't even fucking know. Honestly, this was bloody great, I'm almost as hyped for this as I am for the Big One, and it comes out on the day of my exam, so as soon as I am done with that, I can pick it up and rock out to it.

- **Battle Beast:** This was alright, a little too reserved and a little to safe in instrumentation, but overall, a pretty fun song to rock out to. Plus, that guitar solo was fucking rad.

What I missed:

- **Setheist:** This is different. The instruments are so heavy! I like it. The instrumentation is super heavy and slow. The Vocals are brilliant, and really break up some of the heaviness of the instruments with their softness. The instruments tend to break their own melody at times, but overall, I found this song to be really interesting.

- **Wizardmask:** Worth the label of Glorious Russian Power Metal? Maybe, it's bloody damn well close. The instrumentation is brilliant, a little slow, but that is made up for by how well they incorporated the symphonic elements to the main tune. The Vocals are what you'd expect from the Russians - insane control, insane inflection, just insanely good.

/u/UnlostHorizon's Recommendation of the Week:

Honestly, I think recommending **Jupiter** this week is a no-brainer, because they are too fucking good. It's like a race won by default, there wasn't even any legitimate competition to make things interesting.

- *Last Moment:* Check out what I said for the first time Jupiter came up in this. This was the song that I meant by ""Traditional JPower"". And it is - The instrumentation is Fast, Intricate and Light and the Vocals are bright, happy sounding and kept to a small range of pitch. This is the kind of song you show someone when they tell you that JPower is the same as EuroPower to prove them incorrect.

- *Luminous:* Here is where Jupiter breaks the JPower rules - This is an awesome Balad, and show just how versatile they can be with their music. The instrumentation went from fast and light to slow, rough and epic (By the end, I was wondering how many more guitar solos they could stuff in there).  The vocals went from being kept into a small range of pitch to using the whole spectrum that guy can blast out, and that's before the female backing vocalist comes in to the equation. Overall, it is a great bloody song.

- *Arcadia:* And Jupiter continues to break the rules of JPower with the next one as well. This one is a lot rougher than Last Moment, and throws in a ton of thrashy techniques. Even with this, they keep everything fast and brutal. The vocals could honestly not be there and I'd still think that this was amazing, but with them... man... Honestly, this is fucking sick.

- *Darkness:* I've been excited for this one since the beginning of this list. The instrumentation is fast and brutal, while still containing a huge amount of the JPower vibe that you'd want, but that is not the sick thing about *this song*. The fucking vocals man. I got to say that I really love what they did with this song, the Instrumentation is the perfect way to diffuse the roughness and heaviness of the Growlo, and allows the song to be an insane amount of fun. Goddamn brilliant.

- *~~Koori no Naka no Shoujo~~ 氷の中の少女:* And we are back to Traditional JPower. Honestly, after Darkness, I would have liked a song in between it and this to lead back to this lighter style, but even without it, this song is still great. The breakneck pace they set with this song is fucking great.

- *Sacred Altar:* Honestly, considering how many songs that we have been through from Jupiter, it is telling that this is the only song that I've had any form of reservation towards. The instrumentation is goddamn perfect. The only thing I am half-half about is the Harsh Vocals that they start the song with, which I dislike in pretty much every situation. In this one, everything else is so damn good that I can overlook them.

EDIT: I forgot to say: ""By the end of the week, how about by the end of the motherfucking day mate?""

Well, that looks like that's it for the week, so I'll go back to studying for my exam. I'll see you all next week, or in my Preview of 2014 thread, whichever comes first (I still have 3 months of previews to sort out, so it'll probably be next weeks thread)."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","&gt; Koori no Naka no Shoujo (I'm not sure if the name /u/UnlostHorizon gave is correct, because it is on the album cover picture for the next song too)

What I put is the correct song title. ""Sacred Altar"" was track 2, or the B-side, on the single for ""Koori no Naka no Shoujo"", and that's just the romanized name of the song. Jupiter usually put two tracks on all of their single releases.

It's great to know someone is else is excited for the new Jupiter album too. 2013 felt lacking without some more of their awesome songs.

Extra props for the aggression in your edit."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","Thanks for the clarification, I thought that it might have been a Single, and that was the reason for the Hira/Kanji being the same on the front of the album, but I wasn't sure."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","Infernal Manes is actually kind of good, even if they just pay tribute to older Heavy Metal bands, you know, Priest, King, Manowar, the sorts..."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","All eyes on Battle Beast and praying it's not going to be disappointing. "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","Can someone tell me the actual names of the member in Jupiter? I want to be sure who's male and whose female :P

From the couple of videos i've seen, i have made the conclusion that only the guitarist in the dress is actually a girl/woman and the rest are varying degrees of bishonen :P"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","They're all male. I'm relatively sure the guitarist you mentioned, Hizaki, is a cross dresser, but I'm not completely sure if he wears dresses as part of his stage persona or if he does it in normal day-to-day life too."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/05 - 1/11)","What? You mean to tell me [this](http://static.tumblr.com/c7908519141dd05fe0425de934e028ee/bvytf85/eoOmodsna/tumblr_static_hizaki.jpg) cutie is actually a guy?

Man, Japanese and their dang bishonens, deceiving an honest man into thinking there's a chick involved when it's a sausage fest :P"

"A Beginner's Guide to Heavenly","Heavenly was an unexpected decision for my second guide - unlike with Sonata Arctica, which I had known and loved for years, I have only discovered Heavenly in the last few months, after joining this subreddit. But they have quickly become one of my all-time favorite power metal bands, and I figured I might as well put my recent obsession with them to good use. 

Heavenly, so far as I can tell, occupies a bit of an odd space in the Power Metal scene. They are not often talked about or mentioned as one of the ""greats"", and yet everyone who has heard of them seems to absolutely love at least a part of their discography. Through my research it has become clear why some of the albums I adore are not as well loved by others, but the general consensus across the board is that their album *Dust to Dust* is as deserving of a place on the sidebar as anything there. 

**Note: For those new to Heavenly, I suggest starting with their album Dust to Dust and on, which is when they really come into their own. Their earlier work is somewhat lackluster, and eminently skippable, though with some definite merits.**

**Some History:** 
Based in Marseille, France, this band began in 1993 as a cover band under the name ""Satan's Lawyer"", started by lead singer Benjamin Sotto and drummer Max Pilo. By 1994 they had morphed into a full fledged power metal band in their own right, heavily influenced by Helloween and Gamma Ray, among others. After the usual member shuffle and a short demo (which got them signed to label Noise Records), the lineup looked like this: Benjamin Sotto (Vocals), Max Pilo (Drummer), Chris Savourey (Guitar) and Laurent Jean (Bass). While most often categorized as power metal, the discerning ear will note heavy classical and progressive influences (and maybe even some Queen...) 
 
[**2000: Coming from the Sky**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7h9GOxYyKY)

**lineup: Benjamin Sotto, Chris Savourey, Laurent Jean, Maxence Pilo, Charley Corbiaux**

Though a solid debut, Heavenly had not yet developed their utterly unique style, and many reviews deride this album as somewhat derivative. Often compared to Gamma Ray, Iron Savior, and late 80s Helloween (almost all reviews mention Benjamin Sotto's vocal resemblance to Michael Kiske) this album is significantly different tonally and stylistically from what they would later evolve into. Despite these failings, this album was well received by the metal community. 

*The Fan Favorite:*: [Riding Through Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNer2g5D6D4): The best song off the album. A bit slow to get started, but full of strong vocals and rocking instrumentals. 

*My Tops*:

1. [Time Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0WqZratZhQ): Featuring the frontmen of Gamma Ray and Iron Savior, it is perhaps no surprise that this song brings both those bands to mind. The vocally layered chorus is one of the most sing-able off the album. 

**Between Albums:** 
 
Bassist Larent Jean departs and is replaced by Pierre-Emmanuel Pélisson. In addition, Frédéric Leclercq is added on keyboards originally, before replacing Chris Savourey on guitar. 

[**2001: Sign of the Winner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1l6GXzFAoI)

**Lineup: Benjamin Sotto, Frédéric Leclercq, Pierre-Emmanuel Pélisson, Maxence Pilo, Charley Corbiaux**

Once again, some of the key critical terms when referring to this album are - ""derivative"", ""done before"", ""sounds like""... Heavenly delivers here a solid album, but too clearly influenced by other bands and not yet displaying enough of their own unique style. 

*The Fan Favorite*: [Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymfrq4RrFtU): With an instrumental theme that kicks off from the last note and lasts until the song trails out, and merges into the main vocals, this is probably the best song off the album, by quite a margin. 

*My Tops*:

1. [Break the Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBY-i3fm0qM): The first song of the album, this is a 4 minute instrumental introduction, that I find myself listening to more often than any of the other songs. While it can be a bit repetitive in segments, it developed several themes I keep coming back to hear over and over. 

2. [The Sandman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMunUMf2a8A): Vocally layered with an interesting musical theme, this song is worth your time. 

[**2004: Dust to Dust**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOp-Akk59sE)

**Lineup: Benjamin Sotto, Frédéric Leclercq, Pierre-Emmanuel Pélisson, Maxence Pilo, Charley Corbiaux**

This album is where Heavenly really comes into their own, finally moving from a more cookie cutter sound to something totally new and all theirs. While there is still some merit to be found in earlier albums, most fans tend to stick with this album and later ones. The jump in quality here is nearly unbelievable - from their somewhat lackluster earlier work, to what is one of the best power metal albums I've ever heard. 

*Dust to Dust* is a concept album about a man seeking revenge against his master, the vampire who turned him and caused his eternal damnation.  

*The Fan Favorite*: [Miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUB4Wvo2suw): Strident guitar solos over piano melodies, fading into and out of each other. Almost hymnal vocals giving way to heartfelt wails. This song is a revelation in and of itself, mirroring the one found in this song by the album's protagonist. Power metal doesn't get much better than this. 

*My Tops:*

1. [Evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IEX7U-Ht2U): Quickly establishes a fast rhythm and simple melody, which soon builds up to one of my favorite choruses of all time. *""Glory, to the miracle...""*

2. [Victory (Creature of the Night)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gts4hv99FVA): Beginning with a wonderful piano melody under Sotto's vocals, this song then wanders through several musical themes before finally finding its refrain. But this is not a song getting lost, but instead exploring new territory, in such a way that you can't help but to travel with it. 

**Between Albums**

Frédéric Leclercq, Max Pilo, and Pierre-Emmanuel Pélisson depart, to be replaced by Thomas Das Neves (drums), Olivier Lapauze (guitar), and Matthieu Plana (Bass). 

[**2006: Virus**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRvoaq6KYtI)

**Lineup: Benjamin Sotto, Olivier Lapauze, Matthieu Plana, Thomas Das Neves, Charley Corbiaux**

This album only continues the band's upwards trend. Virus is their most popular album, and the one most quoted by fans as their absolute favorite. Full of brilliant vocals and rich instrumentals, it is this album that helps cement Heavenly at the top of the power metal genre. Nevertheless, there are fans that hold that nothing after *Dust to Dust* was able to reach that same height, and that *Virus* once again relies too much on Heavenly's influences. 

*The Fan Favorite*: [Virus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6ZJP1QyeBo): Starts right in with the heavy guitars, melding it with dark vocals and all moving towards a fantastic chorus. *""Just remember the man you used to be...""*

*My Tops*:

1. [Spill Blood on Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE8XoLzDEFs): One of those songs you can never seem to get out of your head... 

2. [The Dark Memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LelYBwaJKZo): Moody and full of rich instruments and vocals, this song hits home. 

[**2009: Carpe Diem**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0ZAwvfnYvQ)

**NOTE: ALL the links from this album (including the full album link above) are NSFW, due to the album artwork.**

**Lineup: Benjamin Sotto, Olivier Lapauze, Matthieu Plana, Thomas Das Neves, Charley Corbiaux**

Despite a [cover (NSFW)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Heavenly_-_Carpe_Diem.jpg) you'd hate to be seen in public with, Heavenly only continues their upward trend with this album. Fans seem to either love or hate this album depending on what they're looking for - while fans of the Gamma Ray clone are (mostly) disappointed, there are others who love the new elements this album brings to the table (not least among them an obvious tonal and instrumental similarity to Queen). The vocals really take the frontline in this album, with many great refrains and layered harmonies. This was the album that introduced me to Heavenly, and comes a close second (behind Dust to Dust) in my personal rating of their discography. 

*The Fan Favorite*: [Carpe Diem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu2V_Ea5UgU): Guitar solos vie for control with a rich chorus, and the song is the only one who wins. 

*My Tops:* 

1. [Lost In Your Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8citLM_uR8Q): Jumping straight into a fantastic melody, the guitars push the song all the way to fantastic chorus. 

2. [Fullmoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwcutxyxjI4): *""She should not lock the open door...""* Just joking. The instruments hold up the vocals, all melding together in a chorus that will have you singing along just as much as any other FullMoons might. 

**What's Next?** 

Despite several years without the release of new material, Heavenly has made claims on their Facebook page that they are working on and planning to record a new album, though it is unclear at this point where the project stands. "
"A Beginner's Guide to Heavenly","Great guide. I'm itching to listen to more Heavenly right now. Although I think you should link to the music videos for Lost In Your Eyes and Fullmoon. I know they're incredibly cheesy and pointless, but if for nothing else, they're good introductions to the band.

Btw, your guides are always fun to read, and your formatting is superb."
"A Beginner's Guide to Heavenly","Thanks! I had considered linking those videos, but there were just slightly too many topless dancing ladies for me to feel really comfortable about it. "
"A Beginner's Guide to Heavenly","I figured that was the issue. Those music videos were my introduction to the band, so at least it gives people an incentive to check them out, haha.

"Sonata Arctica - Still Loving You","Hah, used this song for spurt training! Played it on repeat, ran while it's hard&amp;fast, breaktime during slow intro. "
"Sonata Arctica - Still Loving You","Probably my favorite PM cover of all time.  On my first listen I was first thinking 'ok, this is a decent, if not a little too faithful cover.' Then when the song kicked into high gear, I was completely floored and hyped up."

Yes, I was referring to visual novels (specifically Black Cyc's series), but I figured more people would know what manga is than a Japanese visual novel/hentai. Besides, I didn't want to have to explain what *types* of novels they were.

Recommended for those who who favor heavier power metal.

\m/"
"Scar Symmetry - Ghost Prototype I: Measurement of Thought (not entirely power metal)","If you use that definition then you can pretty much merge this sub with /r/melodicdeathmetal  straight away

power metal is a fairly large influence on the entire genre (mainly the guitars)

Scar Symmetry is not power metal and Persuader isn't death metal because he occasionally growls

As an example just take a look at the roots of Melo-death aka The Gothenburg Sound

At The Gates/In Flames/Dark Tranquillity is heavily credited for creating the entire genre, well did you know that HammerFall originally had Jesper Strömblad on drums (Guitarist for In Flames), Glenn Ljungström on guitars (In Flames), Johan Larsson on Bass (Bassist for In Flames), Niklas Sundin on guitars (Dark Tranquillity) and finally Mikael Stanne on vocals (Dark Tranquillity)

So the TLDR. Hammerfall was originally a clusterfuck of In Flames &amp; Dark Tranquillity members

You also had a band called Ceremonial Oath (Death/Trash) 

Some of the members

Oskar Dronjak (Hammerfall), Anders Fridén (In Flames), Anders Iwers (In Flames), Jesper Strömblad (Hammerfall/In Flames) 

TLDR2: The Gothenburg Sound has a fairly heavy power metal influence"

**UnlostHorizon's Recommendation of the Week**

I hope nothing happened to /u/SinuataBouquet. Anyone here know him personally?

This week, I'm gonna recommend **Scanner** for you USPM fans (I know they're German, whatever). The preview song is solid to say the least, and it's a great breath of fresh air from the heaps of Europower that's being released right now. Speaking of Europe, though, if you haven't already done so, check out that **Serious Black** album. For some reason it's not on the Metal Archives (someone go fix that), but it's a supergroup with some serious starpower. Their album is fantastic to say the least. The track I've linked to reminds me quite a bit of Firewind and Masterplan, so if you like those bands, this is definitely worth your time.

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","I'm fucking sick and can't leave home, I'm tired, grumpy and can’t concentrate on anything, take this with several grains of salt and pepper.

**Satan's Host - Pre-dating God Part 2** - Blackened Black *slash* Power Metal… What a combo and a strange one at that. I do think it’s a strong song but I feel like the black metal parts suffer from the lack of raw guitar production. The vocals are a big plus.

**Arcane - Known/Learned** - Definitely an interesting progressive song. Starts really slow and just builds to the second half, if you’re not interested in progressive metal, skip this one. Sense of déjà-vu though.

**Trial – Vessel** - Just an okay heavy metal song, there’s nothing special. Can’t really expand on this one.

**Scanner - The Judgement** - Blazing fast in your face power song, can’t really go wrong with this one. Cool riff, some sweet licks and decent vocals, this one just grabs you from the start and doesn’t let you go.

**Stormwitch - Season of the Witch** - Weak half-assed song, bad vocals, intro riff shows promise but everything falls apart after that. The lyrics are the big offender here: “This war is good, this war is bad” “We are the first, we are the last, warriors, we the first, the last, warriors”. The worst part is the chorus, that fade in fade out wailing voices saying “warriors” belongs to amateur bands. 

**Illuminata - Where Stories Unfold** - Arf, so dramatic, not in the mood for this one, if you like heavily orchestrated anthems, it’s probably for you.

**Stargazery - Stars Aligned** - Stargazery? What kind of faggot ass name is that? Musically and lyrically devoid of quality content, keyboards too heavy in the mix, vocals are not good enough. The song just plods and doesn’t get anywhere. Shit solo.

What I might have missed last week...

**Vexillum - Over the Clouds (Single)** - Good song but nothing special, vocals are weak and kinda hurts the song, the instrumentation is good enough but the drumming’s double bass is a bit too high up in the mix, the solo section rocked my double winter socks off. 

**Inside Mankind – Oikoumene** - Everything is bad. Everything! The drumming, the vocals, the guitars, the keyboard melodies and even worse, crunched production that creates an obnoxious wall of sound and delivers undecipherable instruments to the song.

**Automaton - Hot Off the Press (Single)** - Had potential with the quick intro, becomes to tame then and also suffers from some mixing issues, double bass being too upfront and the solo stands out in a weird not natural way.

**Serious Black - As Daylight Breaks** - Serious Black? More like Serious Power! Kekekeke. In all seriousness (no pun intended), the song starts a bit too slowly for me but it does unleash itself in all its glory all over your face. Well mixed with the double bass being buried just enough and keyboard melodies added tastefully to enhance the song. Great vocals too.

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","Fazermint signing in. Do we silently mourn /u/SinuataBouquet?

* **Satan's Host**: This ultimately sounds a lot worse than Part 1. Some unclean vocals first, then they switch over to weird-ass high-pitch vocals, and then finally to some normal vocals. Vocal styles aside, this is a pretty boring song.  
* **Scanner**: This sounds pretty old-school. Not that that's a bad thing. Leaning more towards heavy than power, but the instrumentation is solid and there's a cool guitar solo and stuff.  
* **Stormwitch**: I know I'm picky when it comes to vocalists, but I can't be the only one that thinks this is bad. Guitar solo is okay, but whatever. Generic stuff.  
* **Illuminata**: The focus here is on the vocals, which are pretty good. The symphonic instrumentation is decent. However, this isn't nearly powerful enough to get your power metal itch scratched. Good, but hardly PM.  
* **Vexillum**: Glad I got to hear a single from this album, last week was only a trailer. I checked out ""Fire and Blood"" when it was posted, but this one, ""Over the Clouds"", is tons better IMO. I love it! Chris Bay sounds great, and the song is catchy as folk power should be. There's pretty cool flutes going on, and the guitar solo is great. Vexillum has a new fan!  
* **Inside Mankind**: Symphonic, Progressive AND Power Metal? All my favorite genres in one! Yeah I had high hopes for this, but uuuugh. I can't get myself to like the voice in this one. The instrumentation is nothing special either.  
* **Automaton**: Oh I dig the album art. Airships are cool. I've played too many Final Fantasy games... The song is pretty cool. The chorus not so much, but the guy's voice is solid and the verses are decent. Instrumentation is very solid. I'm sure this can grow on me!  
* **Serious Black**: /u/UnlostHorizon man, thanks for including this one. I absolutely dig this! Unlike what the name might imply, this is melodic PM, and does indeed bear a resemblance to Masterplan (Roland Grapow says hello). It's a great song through and through.

Allrighty. My highligths are **Vexillum** and **Serious Black**, both oh which have got a new fan!"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","I always look forward to these posts. Thanks!"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","whoa, 13 years since a release from scanner. That's great that they released something new."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","[deleted]"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","I wish I could get excited for any of these... but I just cant wait for January 30th. The best album of the next few years is going to be released and nothing in those thread will be able to compare.

Thanks for the effort though. If we lived in a world where Blind Guardian dont exist, those would be my #1 reference for power metal release."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","What, you only listen to BG?"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","Well, no, i listen to some other band, like Rhapsody and Luca Turilli, but Blind Guardian is the only power metal band that have nothing but good stuff. Everything seem bland compared to Blind Guardian. They are the very essence of power metal.

If I buy a band album (which is very rare), I usually listen to it once or twice, take 1 or 2 song and put them in my power metal playlist. Than I almost never listen to the complete album ever again. With Blind Guardian, I listen to at least 1 complete album everyday (and have been doing that for the past 15 years). There is just nothing that compare to the level of perfection they have reached.

I wish I could find a band that have half as much good stuff as Blind Guardian, but most band have stuff that sound very annoying to me in most song. Like Pathfinder. I love 95% of each song, but that singer have to scream very high note at the end of each verse and it make me want to rip my ear out. I just cant listen to them because of that. Or Iced earth, which everyone seem to like, but to me their music just feel slow and boring (like pretty much any american power metal band)

The only band that can compare is Rhapsody, but since 2006 their music have been increasingly more boring to me. Sonata Arctica is another that I liked very much, but now its just terrible. The Ecliptica re-release felt like the band were laughing at their best album. They even had the nerve to put a stripper song on it...

If you have any suggestion, I welcome them very much, but I asked many time and nobody ever came up with a suggestion thats as good as Blind Guardian. This is why im kind of apathetic of the genre. I found the best stuff from the get go, and now whatever I listen to, it just wont make me feel warm and fuzzy like Blind Guardian does."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","That's fine and all. I feel the same way about Lost Horizon. I'm sure everyone has a band they admire the same way, but my issue is with this line.

&gt; If we lived in a world where Blind Guardian dont exist, those would be my #1 reference for power metal release.

So since BG exists, you decide its futile to listen to anything else coming out because you know it won't be as good as your favorite band? I *know* nothing will ever be as good as Lost Horizon (a bit of an exaggeration), but I still check out albums every week to hear some good music. You can listen to good music without expecting perfection."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","A lot of smaller bands have potential to make something kickass but don't have the motivation. By buying their reasonably good albums (that's if you like them) and showing you believe they can kick even more ass, they may develop into a consistently kickass band. That's why I don't just listen to Sonata Arctica. (Example, Viathyn from their first album to Cynosure only had the drive to continue since people said they really enjoyed the first album and they had the potential to make something really kick-ass. Then they did.)"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","The thing is... I dont like most power metal. It just feel bland to me compared to Blind Guardian. The only band that released something I liked in the last 5 years (except Blind Guardian) is Gloryhammer. Im becoming more and more apathetic of the genre as time goes by. Yes I could spend 7-8 hours listening to all those album every week, but I know I wont enjoy it as much as spending 7-8 hours listening to Blind Guardian.

I use to check every release, but after not finding anything to my taste for so long, I just kind of stopped.

Just like with death metal, I will go to power metal show and enjoy myself, but I will never put listen to one of those album by myself because I have the possibility to listen to something better.

Its kind of like eating a normal steak when I have the possibility to enjoy the best Kobe Beef there is. I will always choose the Kobe Beef.

There are some song from other band that enjoy as much as Blind Guardian, but those band new release are just not as good as their old stuff. (Rhapsody, Luca Turilli and Sonata Arctica).

I wish I was more interested in other band, but Im not. I dont know why. Its just like that."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","All right, that I understand. I'm the same way - I mainly listen to the PM playlist I've put together. I'm constantly updating it though, but often only one or two tracks from an entire band.

I'm perfectly content with listening to only one or two songs from an album, but that's easy to say since I don't actually buy them. (Ohnoes)

Well, I'm sure you've tried most of the stuff from the sidebar. The albums listed there aren't always the actual best album IMO, but you know. 3 albums that I find myself listening to in their entirety are **Heavenly** - *Virus*, **Masterplan** - *Aeronautics*, and **Fairyland** - *Score to a New Beginning*.

There's nothing wrong with hardcoring BG all day every day, I just wondered if you *only* listened to that :P
"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","Blind Guardian was my first band and remain by far my favorite as well, but there's plenty of great stuff out there, though you have to approach it on the grounds that they're doing their own thing, and not simply ripping off Blind Guardian, and that that's a great thing for them to do."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","You may be onto something there. The first Power Metal band I heard was rhapsody and the second one was Blind Guardian. I fell in love immediately with both those band. They were the music I had been waiting for my whole life without knowing it. Maybe I just have insanely high expectation for the genre because of how I was introduced in the genre. As I said, music from other band just dont make me feel anything. Its very hard to love their stuff, because it dont make me feel warm and fuzzy inside like Blind Guardian or Iron Maiden do.

&gt;simply ripping off Blind Guardian,

I wish I could find a band that did that, but since Blind Guardian have been playing music since the 80s and nobody have attempted that, I highly doubt that there is a band that can do it. I kind of feel like Blind Guardian is its own genre from how different it sound from other power metal. "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/19 - 1/25)","Blind Guardian certainly is rather unique due to their drawing on symphonic, prog, and folk elements in ways that others don't, as well as André and Hansi both having very distinct styles for their respective roles. They nevertheless are very much power metal, and other bands have drawn inspiration from them or have a similar style. Here's a sample of such bands:

[Savage Circus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfMvrCg3ANU)

[Noble Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPn2e5zG1Lk)

[Falconer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72bJ-_p4olI)

[Heavatar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7RJkiKAiR8)

[Triosphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0)

[Persuader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIge-101ot4)

Ultimately, this stuff is all subjective. If other power metal bands don't do anything for you, there's not really anything that can be done about that. However, it's certainly the opinion of many that there's more than one excellent band in this genre. My first album was Nightfall in Middle-earth - nothing's come close to matching that for me, but that doesn't mean that I haven't found plenty of fantastic bands in the subgenre."
"Jupiter - Arcadia (x-post /r/visualkei)",""
"Jupiter - Arcadia (x-post /r/visualkei)","So I'm quite a fan of Versailles, and Jupiter is basically Versailles with a different singer. It took me a while to get into their previous album, the new singer just isn't as good and it took some getting used to, but after getting past that, it was a seriously solid album. Their new album is coming out in January and I'm seriously looking forward to it. "
"Jupiter - Arcadia (x-post /r/visualkei)","i feel the same, hope someday they reband again"
"Jupiter - Arcadia (x-post /r/visualkei)","I'd hope so too, but Kamijo seems to be doing his own thing as well, he's had a new album out since September. From what I've heard of his stuff, it's just not Versailles"

"Holy Grail - My Last Attack","I remember first hearing this song thinking wow this band is going to be amazing. After getting the CD ""My Last Attack"" was the only song I really liked. 

The other songs sounded a lot more Avenge Sevenfold Influenced, not sure what genre that is but it sounded more like that. "

"Pathfinder taken off Spotify?","This is why I'm wary of services like Spotify. Music just appears and disappears at the whim of some corporate shitheads because of dumb license politics."
"Pathfinder taken off Spotify?","Dunno why, but something is fucked up with spotify. Blind Guardian ""Twilight of the Gods"" is not available too. I was listening to it yesterday. Today morning i wanted to listen to it and it wasn't available in my country. Battle Beasts albums are not avaible as well. Something is wrong.

"Bruce Dickinson - Accident of Birth (I love how Bruce sings on this).","I absolutely adore Bruce's solo stuff. I actually listen to it much more than Maiden. *(Though, to be fair, that's partly because I overloaded on Maiden when I was younger, then starting exploring other stuff.)*

"Bruce Dickinson - Accident of Birth (I love how Bruce sings on this).","It's one of those Stairway to Heaven type tracks. It starts out with a pretty nice acoustic bit then it builds and builds into a big sweeping climax with a wicked solo.

Freakin awesome subject matter too. It's about how inevitably (over hundreds of billions of years, mind you) our sun is going to grow then scorch/swallow the earth. It's really easy to get into as a power metal fan.

"Blind Guardian announces their new bassist!","That seems to be the case. Though it's worth noting that Hansi and André are technically the only remaining orignal members - Marcus joined up prior to the first album. Frederik, of course, replaced Thomen."
"Blind Guardian announces their new bassist!","Yeah, good point, but you know what I meant. Core members probably would have been a better word choice."
"Blind Guardian announces their new bassist!","I know, which is why I included 'technically' just in case anyone didn't know."
"Blind Guardian announces their new bassist!","Did they ever have an official bassist? Wiki implies there's only been session bassists (Hansi pulling bass duty in the early years). I always associate Oliver Holzwarth as their bassist."
"Blind Guardian announces their new bassist!","Hansi was their official bassist until he decided to just focus on vocals. Oliver was a long-term guest bassist - the band's given reasoning was that they wanted the slot open if Hansi ever decided to take up being the band's bassist again. I guess he's decided that that's not going to happen."
"Blind Guardian announces their new bassist!","Well, Hansi was their official bassist until Nightfall.  After that it was just session musicians. "

The only song that comes close for me is Hallowed By Thy Name.  Specifically the Beast Over Hammersmith recording.  I've said this many times, Iron Maiden was absolutely flawless that night. "

"Fun stuff from wikipedia...","Sometimes people talk about power metal articles on wikipedia. Sometimes they say funny stuff. Here is a small collection of such moments, though it's not terribly expansive so dig around and post your own discoveries!

It's amazing how funny people can get over genre disputes...

**Blind Guardian**
&gt;I personally believe that Blind Guardian is somewhat Christian-Metal because on most of their albums, they have at least one, if not more songs about The Bible or Jesus. If you have any conflicting beliefs, please tell me them.

-

&gt;[On A Night at the Opera's title] Sorry but copying the name of another album is....lame. 

**Helloween**
&gt;[On the contentious point of the band being labeled 'power metal'] According to their website they play 'German Melodic-Speed-Metal', and really, shouldn't the article reflect the band?

-

&gt;[On Keeper of the Seven Keys Part I] Have someone of authors of the article listened to the album if they had have, the would have realized, that the album is NOT Power Metal, but more mixture of Heavy and Speed Metal.

**Sonata Arctica**
&gt;Ecliptica rated 2 stars ?? what the heck? i have recknoning night and its nice but it isnt better then this one by any means so why is this 2 stars and that one almost 5 stars

-

&gt;most of Sonata Arcticas songs break the mold of power metal, they don't sound at all like Edguy or HammerFall which are pretty generic ... It would just seem to be incorrect to say that this is totally the same genre as DragonForce or Edguy. 

-

&gt;This is definitely a progressive album, almost to the point where you could call it ""pop metal"".

**Gamma Ray**
&gt;""Helloween lost its continuity and did not develop to its full potential. ""

-

&gt;[Land of the Free Part II] was in 1995... at least thats what it says in the iTunes store in iTunes or in the iTunes store search ""Gamma Ray"" and it will show that in 1995 was its release date.

-

&gt;the correct name of this album is Power Plant, not Powerplant. The two-word spelling vaguely conjures up images of vegetation in my mind


**Kamelot**

[This beauty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kamelot#Genre)

**Nightwish**

[Goddamned everything!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nightwish)

**Stratovarius**

&gt;Stratovarius is satanic! Officially

-
&gt;It's just not true, it was actually created by Yngwie Malmsteen. The COB quote which has no citation, even if that quote is true , that is not true what he says, again, what he credits for Stratovarius was created by Yngwie Malmsteen.And who cares if they had impact on COB?Actually they were the most influential euro metal band after Visions release, and that's the only thing that matters, that a question of editorial quality.

**Angra**

&gt;This Genre not exist; Progressive Power Metal, they are just Power Metal, some symphonic (ex: the power Band ""Nightwish"", but not ""progressive"". There isn´t elements of Progressive Rock/Metal in their Musics.
"
"Fun stuff from wikipedia...","Don't change genres on the god damn articles. I have enough reverting of that to do as it is to people who edit wikipedia when they can barely understand english. Needs sources that indicate the genre to add genres. Removing genres should just not happen, as they should have sources that indicate them. The carnage on Epica's article was great as well.

For your laughs:
[Genre warrioring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Genre_Warrior)

I had some guy tell me I couldn't change Riot's article to be called ""Riot V"" because their frontman died, and it was ""disrespectful"" to talk about anything after he died. Needless to say, that guy got banned for preventing the development of an accurate article. When responding to my comments asking why he would do things, he would literally copy half of what I said and reverse it in order to make a counterpoint. I could tell he could not reasonably understand english. 

Also Ecliptica was legitimately rated 2 stars by Allmusic, which is a reliable source. Can't help that Antti J. Ravelin didn't like ecliptica. Eduardo Rivadavia gave Reckoning Night 4.5/5 on allmusic, so at least he likes them.
"
"Fun stuff from wikipedia...","Silly question, but... is it pronounced ""Symphony X"" like the letter or ""Symphony Ten""? How about V--is it Vee or Five?


 Why does it say deceased under Tobias Sammet under the section Vocalists"
"Fun stuff from wikipedia...","From Wikipedia:

&gt;Michael Romeo about the origin of their name: ""So, you know, the music we were coming up with had the keyboard thing and the guitar, and some classical elements, so the word ‘Symphony’ came up and, so the dramatic thing, you know? So then, somebody said ‘Symphony X’ and we were like, ‘yeah, that’s cool’ it is that kinda thing, **and the ‘X’ is the unknown** and all the other stuff we do.""

Since they're using it as a variable, and not a value, it would be the letter, not the number. Also, in interviews they pronounce it that way.

""V"" clearly represents 5 for the album (Roman numeral V on the cover, it being the 5th album, and part of the story behind the album has to do with the magic of five). While most places online I've seen just refer to the album by the short name ""V"" (the letter), when talking with others about it, I typically hear people refer to it as ""Five"".

And people like messing with others for some reason - Tobias isn't dead, thankfully."
"Fun stuff from wikipedia...","I have it on good authority that there are, in fact, two separate bands with very similar names: ""Symphony X"" (pronounced X, like ex) that almost every fan of power metal knows and ""Symphony X"" (pronounced ten, like the number). To further confuse you, Symphony X (the number) released an album simply titled ""V"" (like the letter, vee), but it is actually pronounced as five (like the number).

The good authority is a local used record store, they wrote ""Symphony Ten - Five"" for the listing. They couldn't have made a mistake, right?"
"Fun stuff from wikipedia...","I always believed it was a nod to Beethoven's alleged tenth symphony.

Granted, I always called it Symphony X (the letter), but it's not a horrible guess I suppose."
"Fun stuff from wikipedia...","I have a feeling the last comment was made by WishmasterTheDark. He's pretty notorious in youtube for forcing his opinion down other people's throats on what is (and mostly what isn't) power metal, complete with bad english, internet tough-guyism and everything. "
"Fun stuff from wikipedia...","The genre disputes are hilarious. Regarding the definition of ""progressive"" in Kamelot's section: ""it mearly [sic] means experimenting in diffrent time signatures"".  
Oh lawdy."

Really? I see them as very well written, actually. I think Jani is a fantastic composer and his lyrics, dark, poetic and the right amount of teenage-angsty, fit very well in his sound.

"Cain's Offering - Morhpeus In A Masquerade. Listen to this song and see how every part of this song is different from each other, how Timo's singing every verse in a totally different way from the last one","I see them as a bit too angsty, but as I said, with Timo's voice it is simply amplified beyond the point where i can take heartfelt lyrics seriously. 

Or rather, it may be the fact that it doesn't sound like proper english, sort of like when the japanese butcher english it's impossible to take a song even with good instrumentation seriously. Obviously it's not as bad, but lines like ""I need it to make this thing right"" sound too colloquial to be taken seriously alongside ""I am unworthy to be sacrificed, I'm such a tragic comic"". It's a bit awkward. As I said, I can appreciate the instrumental work (to an extent), but their first album has vocals that I find hard to take a liking to. Also, he pronounces things incorrectly ""please caerss me"""

And his timbre is very odd at his highest notes. And I don't like that vocal fry thing he does when he wants to sound emotional (he does that quite a lot in his acoustic album with Jani). Speaking of Japanese people butchering the English language, Toshi from X Japan strikes me as another acquired taste.

Maybe I just find these accents to be charming."

"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","[Link to the original article](http://www.metal-observer.com/3.o/a-beginners-guide-to-the-world-of-japanese-power-metal/). I'm formatting it and posting it here for those of you who never saw it, as well as for the wiki's sake. Just keep in mind I wrote this about a year ago; some of the info might be slightly out of date.

It can be bizarre. It can also be off-putting. But it’s an entirely new realm of the sub-genre that can afford some great new bands and masterpieces to listeners. The power metal scene has really blossomed since the arrival of X Japan in the ’80s, and since then it’s been taken to new heights and limits.

I’ve found myself getting dragged deeper and deeper into Japan’s power metal scene over the past year, and I can honestly say that its best attribute is its daringness. As Marty Friedman put it so well, “In Japan, taboos are off”. While so many people believe power metal is stagnant in the western hemisphere (which I disagree with, anyway), Japan has been experimenting all along with different sounds, interesting visuals, and pushing the boundaries of the genre, all while maintaining a flavor of the European power metal and speed metal that we all love.

The biggest distinction one could find about Japan’s power metal is two simple words: visual kei. In its simplest definition, it’s Japan’s interpretation of glam metal’s visual element and fashion trends. Musically, however, it can vary anywhere from pop music to melodic death metal and metalcore. While some bands nowadays denounce the self-indulgence of visual kei, Japanese power metal undeniably traces its roots back to the innovators of visual kei: X Japan. Several bands continue the visual kei trend to this day, but most have moved on with slightly less focus to their imagery.

Another important aspect is most bands’ insistence on singing in their native language. Several bands do incorporate the occasional English lyrics into their music or entire English songs, but almost no bands have dedicated their music entirely to the English language. Unfortunately, some of the English pronunciation can be poor at times, but much like Europe’s questionable grasp on the English language, it can lend itself to become an endearing element of the music.

So to help introduce people to the world of Japanese power metal, I thought I’d highlight several noteworthy bands, in my opinion, give them a rundown, and list some important songs of theirs. I’ll be dividing this list into two portions: male-fronted and female-fronted.

#Male-fronted

##[**X Japan**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/X_promo.jpg)

As innovators of visual kei and power metal in Japan, X Japan is without a doubt the most vital band to the development of all sub-genres of metal in Japan. Having achieved mainstream success with *Blue Blood* and shattering records with *Jealousy*, as well as having constructed a 30 minute masterpiece, *Art of Life*, it’s easy to see why they are held in such a high regard. Following their disband, guitarist, hide, took his life, and it took until 2007 for all the side projects to subside and the band to reunite, but not without paying homage to their late guitarist by dedicating their new song, “I.V.” to his memory.

##[**Galneryus**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/GalneryusAngelofSalvationalbumphoto.jpeg)

As one of the most well-known Japanese metal bands of the current millennium, Galneryus have popularized their own brand of neoclassically-tinged power metal in the past decade. Having been kickstarted by Japanese metal veterans, Syu and Yama-B, the band has since undergone numerous lineup changes with songwriter and guitarist, Syu, being the only constant. Their most recent release, *Angel of Salvation*, has seen them receive worldwide acclaim from critics and fans alike heavily in part to the majestic orchestrations and solos employed. In contrast to X Japan, Galneryus has been relatively free of visual kei imagery and outfits and are easily the most famous power metal band to achieve their level of success without the visual kei connection.

##[**Versailles**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/22101-versailles-ftsv.jpg)

With lavish Baroque-era outfits, a dark symphonic power metal sound, and cross-dressing guitarists, it’s hard to not be stunned by the looks of Versailles. Having skyrocketed in popularity since their debut, *Noble*, the band continued with consistent masterpieces of the genre until the band’s mutual hiatus in late 2012. Since then, singer, Kamijo, has carved for himself a successful solo career with a vampire obsession, and the remaining members of Versailles, in addition to singer, Zin, formed the neoclassical power metal band, Jupiter. Both side projects carry on the Versailles spirit fantastically and are recommended to any fans of the genre.

##[**Sex Machineguns**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1230008783000_f.jpg)

As an obvious pun on the Sex Pistols’ band name, Sex Machineguns are probably one of the most prolific metal bands in all of Japan and definitely the most prolific power metal band in Japan. Having embraced the visual kei movement in their heyday in the early ‘00s, the band has slowly shifted away from the flamboyant clothes, but their music has been constant the whole time: a vibrant and humorous mix of thrash and speed and power to create the energetic amalgamation they are. Singer and guitarists, Anchang, remains the only original member of the band, and with a new single out this year SMG seems to be making a comeback of sorts.

##[**Balflare**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balflare_pic1.jpg)

Here’s the dark horse on the list. Balflare aren’t notable for flashy dresses, innovating the power metal genre in Japan, or just being prolific. I’m including them here due to their European style of power metal, a rare trait in most Japanese power metal bands. They’re probably one of the only examples of a band that writes lyrics exclusively in English, and they have a sound very reminiscent of *Silence*-era Sonata Arctica. If for nothing else, Balflare is a great way to transition to the Japanese metal stylings. Unfortunately, they tend to stay rather dormant in between albums with few live shows or even Facebook posts to tide fans over. Hell, I hadn’t even seen a picture of the band until I prepared this article.

#Female-fronted

##[**Aldious**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Aldious.jpg)

Another element of Japan’s metal scene that you’ll soon start to notice is the prevalence of all-female metal bands, something that’s unheard of here in the USA (The Iron Maidens don’t count). And that’s where Aldious shines so well. Their music is incredibly good; so good in fact that you really should neglect referencing their genders. Re:NO’s voice is of a low timbre, a rare trait for any power metal singer, especially a female one, and the rest of the band play speedy power metal that accentuates Re:NO’s delivery perfectly. They’re definitely my most highly recommended band on this female-fronted side of things.

As a complement to Aldious, Cyntia also does the “low-pitched female singer in an all-female band” thing, but Cyntia pulls it off with a bit more melody and a little less speed. Having established entirely new images for themselves with each album, their music has stayed consistently enjoyable. Its heavy/power metal hybrid lends itself well to Cyntia thanks to the teamwork between Saki and Ayano, singer and keyboardist, respectively.

##[**LIGHT BRINGER**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Light-Bringer-Band.jpg)

Neoclassical and visual kei: those are probably the best adjectives to describe LIGHT BRINGER (caps necessary). With an even larger focus on keyboards than Cyntia, they are probably one of the happiest bands I’ve heard from Japan. Fuki, the lead singer, possesses an incredibly powerful voice that’s backed up by a male band who really know how to write a solo or two. What really makes LIGHT BRINGER stand out amongst all these other bands is the progressive elements they incorporate; at times, their music can be incredibly complex, jazzy, and/or technical. It’s a marvelous mixture of styles that have made these guys and gals one of the most exciting modern power metal bands.

##[**Albion**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/3540368194_photo-1024x679.jpg)

Here are some newcomers to the power metal scene. Having only released their debut album, *Campanula*, this year to relatively no fanfare, it’s a wonder to me why more people haven’t taken note of them yet. It’s an album drenched in keyboards, with a relentless and liberal singer who belts out her vocal lines, and intense guitar-keyboard dueling solos that rival those of Sonata Arctica. With only the lone album underneath their belts, I’d definitely recommend a listen to them on Spotify at the very least.

##[**Mary's Blood**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/a2ed8217.png)

Finally, we come full circle to Mary’s Blood, the closest thing to a female X Japan that there is. With their equal focus on speed and guitar-driven melodies, they’re also probably the closest thing to a traditional metal band on this list. After 5 years of teasing fans with singles and EP’s, Mary’s Blood has their debut album, *Countdown to Evolution*, coming out this August, and it looks to be a consistent display of their NWOBHM-tinged speed metal stylings.

Hopefully that provided you with some new listening material and some insight into the world of Japanese power metal. There are plenty of bands that I had to leave out of this guide to preserve my sanity, like Kamijo, Gauntlet, MinstreliX, Skywings, Destrose, and others, but maybe I can cover those later in [a follow-up to this guide](http://www.metal-observer.com/3.o/an-intermediates-guide-to-the-world-of-japanese-power-metal/). I hope you enjoyed this guide and it was of some use to you.

I'll reformat and post [the second part](http://www.metal-observer.com/3.o/an-intermediates-guide-to-the-world-of-japanese-power-metal/) sometime next week."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Nice work, comprehensive and detailed! "
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Holy crap, what a great post!  Thanks!"
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Thanks for this! I've never really listened to the Japanese PM scene, so this is helpful to get into it!"
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","I'm in the same boat; I'm glad /u/UnlostHorizon put this together."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Great post, this gave me the urge to go listen to the ""Art of Life"" again."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","I had completely forgotten about Balfare for years.  Thanks for reminding me of their existence!"
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Thanks for this. I'm loving the hell out of Light Bringer."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Holy crap, LIGHT BRINGER is amazing! Thanks for this very well written writeup!"
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","The Galneryus part needs an update :p

Also I think keyboardist Yuhki has stuck with the band since the beginning. "
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","I'm guessing you didn't read my intro. Sex Machineguns, Mary's Blood, and Cyntia all need updates in their descriptions too. And you're right about Yuhki, but he was a newcomer to the scene when the band formed; that's why he isn't mentioned."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","The timing of this is good. I was listening to Dragon Guardian the other day and I enjoyed it."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Great work! It's just unnatural how short the members are for every group.... "
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","[deleted]"
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Also, check out: Dragon Guardian, Linked Horizon, and Skywings. I don't think those were in those original posts. Jupiter and Kamijo might be forthcoming. A simple google search will give even more results."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Galneryus and X Japan are the only bands I can stomach of the male-fronted ones. For some reason the male singers in Japanese often sound very feminine to me, which gets on my nerves.

However, I have been jamming to some of the female fronted stuff recently."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Kamijo from Lareine and Versailles, Asagi from D, and Hizumi from D'espairsRay (probably not Power Metal actually), are examples of pretty masculine sounding vocalists in Japanese metal, amongst others."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Kamijo and D are both covered in the next part, btw :)"
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","I don't see how you can think Versailles, Sex Machineguns, and Balflare have feminine-sounding singers. I can easily understand if you don't like them, since Kamijo is a weird singer for sure, Anchang does more of a thrashy vocal delivery, and Balflare's singer can't pronounce English to save his life (even though he sounds no different than most European singers), but feminine-sounding? "
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Probably because I hadn't listened to those before. Those sound pretty good. In any case, add Linked Horizon to that list, as I remember liking some of their music now.

Balflare I had listened to, and didn't like because I can't listen to mispronounced english (I get annoyed by Timo Kotipelto's minor accent as it is)

I think it's more that Japanese sounds feminine in general to me, which is stupid, but just how it is."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","No worries, as least you're not writing off the entire nation's music because of one nit-pick you have with their language.

The next part has some bands with harsh vocals, so I'm willing to bet the language issue won't be nearly as big as this time."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Oh I definitely don't write Japanese music off, I have a shitload of soft stuff from female vocalists. (for example, Eufonius)

Galneryus is the only big Japanese band in my PM portion of the library though."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Great list! Quite a few bands I haven't heard of. After work, I'll be sure to check them out. Cheers."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Fantastic list! Those interested may also want to check out [Anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sws1fcaSrO0). While not specifically power metal, many songs are pretty close. "
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","The Japanese Power Metal scene is my second favorite scene (right next to the Russian Power Metal scene). Japan has some reallllly good bands, and despite many of them sounding similar, they all have their own sort of experimentation and original sounds (excluding the clones)

Good article."
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","I love the Japanese power metal scene. Are there any articles written on Brazilian Power Metal? (my other favorite scene); I could write it when I get the chance. I'm just wondering if anyone would read it. "
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","[deleted]"
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Pretty funny how this guy has shit on X Japan in the past. "
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","Jeez, all I said was that their singer wasn't the best. No need to belittle my entire article because of it either. "
"A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Power Metal","I agree, but no voice has been more influential to me; Toshi has the best voice for conveying raw emotion and energy, imo. "
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)",""
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","The Throne, Grand Parade, and Prophecies are all masterpieces. I think this album might be their best, only second to nightfall."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","""Sacred Mind"" as well. And ""The Holy Grail"". And ""At the Edge of Time"". And ""The Ninth Wave"". "
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Pretty much the whole album is really really good, At the Edge of Time is my favorite song on it."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Agreed (on the first sentance; ""Sacred Mind"" is personally my favorite). Except for maybe ""Miracle Machine"". It's a bit... okay. Doesn't do much for me. But I understand why they wanted a short slow song before the epic finale. "
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Miracle Machine sounds like Touched by the Crimson King Hansi decided to revisit The Eldar. Needless to say, I love it."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","There was one song off the album that reminded me of something from Demons &amp; Wizards. I don't remember which, but that might have been it. "
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","At the Edge of the Time is definitely my favourite song on it also.

I also enjoyed Twilight if the Gods, The Throne and the Holy Grail"
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","As much as I enjoy and appreciate this, I have no idea why they would put the whole thing on Youtube so soon after the album's release."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Promotion &amp; marketing. It's a little surprising that Nuclear Blast would do this, since they tend to squash youtube posts of their music, but it's nice to see them trying out streams."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","I'm glad they did it, since although my Earbook had arrived at home already, I was away all week and this allowed me to give a first few listens."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","I never really got the blind guardian circlejerk but this album is amazing."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Their music has a lot of small details that keeps it feeling freash after many re-listens."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","It took me a really long time to figure out these guys, but I've had a similar realization in recent times.  Listening to their albums is a lot like listening to prog for me -- it takes several listens before I can really ""get"" it, partially just because there's so much going on in their music.  "
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","I 100% agree with you.  Even this new album, after loving this band, I feel like the drums are fucked sounding.  They may be growing on me after listening."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","There's a Blind Guardian circlejerk? What? Where? When? Huh?"
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","What an amazing, gloriously epic album from the bards! Next week we'll kick off official album discussions with it.

In the mean time, here's my Blind Guardian (main) album rankings since people have been doing that recently:

1. Nightfall in Middle-earth
2. A Night at the Opera
3. At the Edge of Time
4. Imaginations from the Other Side
5. Beyond the Red Mirror
6. A Twist in the Myth
7. Somewhere Far Beyond
8. Tales from the Twilight World
9. Follow the Blind
10. Battalions of Fear"
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","My list would be the same, except to have one and two switched, and that's just because Night at the Opera was the first power metal I'd ever heard, so it has a special place in my heart. Also, I'd probably put Twist in the Myth lower. Besides *Fly* and *Skalds and Shadows*, I find it a boring album. "
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Awesome, I was going to make a post about a discussion of the new album (wouldn't have been till Monday/Tuesday) but good thing I held off."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","1. Nightfall in Middle-earth
1. At the Edge of Time
1. Imaginations from the Other Side
1. Somewhere Far Beyond
1. A Night at the Opera
1. Beyond the Red Mirror
1. Tales from the Twilight World
1. Follow the Blind
1. A Twist in the Myth
1. Battalions of Fear

would be my ranking. Haven't given Red Mirror a final verdict yet, was a bit underwhelmed on my first listening, but will give it a few more listenings this week."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","My ranking is very different.  
  
1. Somewhere Far Beyond  
2. The Forgotten Tales (I know, not a traditional ""studio album"", but it's so incredibly good. ""To France"" especially).  
3. Battalions of Fear  
4. Nightfall in Middle-Earth  
5. A Night at the Opera  
6. Imaginations from the Other Side  
7. Tales from the Twilight World  
8. A Twist in the Myth  
9. Follow the Blind  
  
And those are all the ones I own, so I'm not gonna cover the other ones :)"
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Vinyl should be here today, I cringed seeing this on the tracking info:

&gt; A late UPS trailer arrival has caused a delay. We're adjusting plans to deliver your package as quickly as possible. / Delivery will be rescheduled. 

...but the weather has been shitty - still, I'm so fucking excited even though I've already listened to it a bunch.

As far as rank is concerned, it's in the same spot in my list, but the rest is a little different:

1. Nightfall in Middle-Earth (no explanation needed)

2. Tales from the Twilight World (mostly because of my favorite BG song, The Last Candle, but the rest of the album is also excellent)

3. A Night at the Opera (the change in style worked, this album is almost perfect)

4. At the Edge of Time (whereas bands tend to get weaker over time, I thought this one kicked a ton of ass)

5. Beyond the Red Mirror (see previous note, add four more years... may eventually swap with AtEoT)

6. Somewhere Far Beyond (title track, Time What is Time and the Bard's Songs keep this above the rest - also has the cover of Queen's Spread Your Wings, which I thought was excellent)

7. Imaginations from the Other Side (this was actually the first album I heard by BG - definitely good, but not better than any of the previous, imo)

8. Follow the Blind / Battalions of Fear / A Twist in the Myth (hard to rank these last three, so I'm keeping them tied for now)

Edit: Honorable Mention: Imaginations Through the Looking Glass, one of the best (if not *the best*) live albums I've ever heard.  What I wouldn't give/do to have been at this show - I don't even want to admit to a lot of it, it gets a little dark..."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Am I the only one who hears a lot of Demons and Wizards in this album? Especially in Miracle Machine."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Hansi definitely takes a D&amp;W approach at times - it's not super prevalent, but it does have a presence. [I also noted the D&amp;W vocals on Miracle Machine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2us6l8/blind_guardian_beyond_the_red_mirror_official/cobf401) I actually think this is the album that Hansi has the most variety in his style, as there's callbacks to most of the stages of his development as a vocalist, and there's plenty of new stuff from him in it as well."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Wasn't too excited by the single, but really refreshing to hear the Ninth Wave."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","I just went through my first listen. So far my fav's are The Ninth Wave, At the Edge of Time, Distant Memories, and Miracle Machine. I think Miracle Machine could have been the best song on the album if at least the chorus was backed up by heavy instrumentation; the chorus is so good! "
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","I love the album, but I find the production quality to be a bit hit or miss, which is a tad disappointing. 

Not sure what I'm talking about? Grab some good headphones and listen to ""Prophecies"" or ""The Throne"" then listen to ""Grand Parade"" or ""Sacred Mind"". It's almost like 2 different studios did the audio engineering. "
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","The new album is amazing! The bards never disappoint! My favorite songs are Prophecies, At The Edge of Time, Twilight of the Gods, Distant Memories and Holy Grail. Ninth Wave, The Throne and Sacred Mind are good too. The only tracks I haven't been able to get into yet (on my third listen) are Ashes of Eternity, Miracle Machine, and Grand Parade."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Not like the old Blind Guardian, but still great. As I have bought the LP, the art on the picture disc is amazing too. Not many bands are that dedicated to get these things right too."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","New album is fantastic and secures the second place on the list. I never thought that would happen.

1. Somewhere Far Beyond
2. Beyond The Red Mirror
3. Tales From The Twilight World
4. Imaginations From The Other Side
5. At The Edge Of Time
6. Nightfall In Middle-Earth
7. Battalions Of Fear
8. A Twist In The Myth
9. A Night At The Opera
10. Follow The Blind"
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Bring back the Blind Guardian from ""Tales"" era, please :("
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Savage Circus and Persuader sound like old BG."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Does Savage Circus still exist?

I never listened to Persuader. Will look into that. Thanks!"
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","Forget about it. Just try to outlive the fact it's impossible to swim two times in the same river - river has changed, you have changed. Try to get band's new staff or look for other bands.

And, man, just listen the album accurately. It full of jewels (several ships to be honest), but not a background music type. A bit hard to get it, but your work will be awarded by tsumamy of ear orgasms.

If you like old BG, there are classy Holy Grail and the Throne and Distant Memories and Sacred Mind."
"Blind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)","I honestly thought ""At the Edge of Time"" was much better, but maybe I just need a few more listening sessions..."

"Has anyone else heard the new version of Fifth Element by Pathfinder with their new singer?","If you donated $5 or more to their crowdfunding campaign, you should have gotten an email with the new version of the track.

"Has anyone else heard the new version of Fifth Element by Pathfinder with their new singer?","Simon was amazing. I wonder what happened to him...
It's sad. One of the greatest power metal voices and puff, disappeared."
"Has anyone else heard the new version of Fifth Element by Pathfinder with their new singer?","Yeah, it is a pretty big step down.  Very sad.  If he does not sound better in their new material, I will be saying goodbye to my favorite band."
"Has anyone else heard the new version of Fifth Element by Pathfinder with their new singer?","I haven't heard it, but your reaction isn't surprising.

Still got Devin Townsend coming on the fourteenth, though, so I've got that to look forward to."
"Just checked out this band, and a pretty fun music video. Unleash the Archers - Dawn of Ages","Just bought their two latest releases. Not a big fan of the lyrics, but everything else is great. "
"Just checked out this band, and a pretty fun music video. Unleash the Archers - Dawn of Ages","Posted about this ad nauseum since we've had a couple of other UTA threads lately, but I'm a huge, huge, huge fan. And I don't typically like female-fronted bands.

Brittney really *knows* how to sing, so I really appreciate that, but I hate the way she sounds on this album. She's fantastic live though, like 100x better than on the albums."
"Just checked out this band, and a pretty fun music video. Unleash the Archers - Dawn of Ages","I appreciate that this female-fronted band is just that.  A band with a female singer.  They don't play off of that aesthetic (cough, Nightwish), they don't sexualize her at all (cough, Epica), she's just a member of the band who's a woman.  

And she's a pretty good singer.  She just needs work on using expression in her singing.  Once she stops singing straight tones and starts adding more emotion, she'll be unstoppable.  That takes time, though, and practice; I believe their next album, or the one after that, she'll really begin to shine."
"Just checked out this band, and a pretty fun music video. Unleash the Archers - Dawn of Ages","The songs I've heard from the new album sound AWESOME. But, again, she always sounds different live than in the studio and I hope this one translates better."

"Just checked out this band, and a pretty fun music video. Unleash the Archers - Dawn of Ages","Wasn't that into their first album (too much growling for my liking) but Demons of the Astrowaste was quite interesting."

"Manowar - Gods Of War || A Hidden Gem on an Otherwise Forgettable Album","Manowar haven't had a tolerable album since 1984."
"Manowar - Gods Of War || A Hidden Gem on an Otherwise Forgettable Album","Disagree but ok."
"Manowar - Gods Of War || A Hidden Gem on an Otherwise Forgettable Album","What??? There's no way Sign Of The Hammer is that old....

Holy Shit, I didn't notice before but Manowar released their best albums in 3 consecutive years... fucking more than 30 years ago.

Gods of War isn't really that bad though, it's more that people are expecting something a lot different from Manowar and this album is a complete snoozefest in comparison. However, it does feel like DeMaio truly did what he wanted to do with this album, even if it greatly lacks in intensity and drive."
"Manowar - Gods Of War || A Hidden Gem on an Otherwise Forgettable Album","Manowar has had a tolerable album?

Seriously, I do not understand these guys..."
"Manowar - Gods Of War || A Hidden Gem on an Otherwise Forgettable Album","I agree. All the songs that are actual songs (ie. not filler BS) are good."
"Manowar - Gods Of War || A Hidden Gem on an Otherwise Forgettable Album","When half the tracks are pointless spoken word pieces, you get a forgettable album.

48 minutes of actual music material on a 73 minute album is unacceptable. At least Blind Guardian kept the spoken word pieces to a minimum on Nightfall."
"Manowar - Gods Of War || A Hidden Gem on an Otherwise Forgettable Album","What about Sleipnir (spelling?)? that song sounds like classic Manowar."

Here's Blind Guardian's Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)!","&gt;Why, O my people... why should we longer serve these jealous gods, who cannot keep us, nor their own realm even, secure from their Enemy? And though he be now their foe, are not they and he of one kin? Vengeance calls me hence, but even were it otherwise, I would not dwell longer in the same land with the kin of my father's slayer and the thief of my treasure. Yet I am not the only valiant in this valiant people. And have ye not all lost your king? And what else have ye not lost, cooped here in a narrow land between the jealous mountains and the harvestless Sea? Here once was light, that the Valar begrudged to Middle-earth, but now dark levels all. Shall we mourn here deedless for ever, a shadow-folk, mist-haunting, dropping vain tears in the salt thankless Sea? Or shall we go home? In Kuiviénen sweet ran the waters under unclouded stars, and wide lands lay about where a free folk might walk. There they lie still and await us who in our folly forsook them. Come away! Let the cowards keep this city. But by the blood of Finwë! unless I dote, if the cowards only remain, then grass will grow in the streets. Nay, rot, mildew, and toadstool. ...Fair shall the end be though long and hard shall be the road! Say farewell to bndage! But say farewell also to ease! Say farewell to the weak! Say farewell to your treasures - more still shall we make! Journey light. But bring with you your swords! For we will go further than Tauros, endure longer than Tulkas: we will never turn back from pursuit. After Morgoth to the ends of the Earth! War shall he have and hatred undying. But when we have conquered and have regained the Silmarils that he stole, then behold! We, we alone, shall be the lords of the unsullied Light, and masters of the bliss and beauty of Arda! No other race shall oust us!'

&gt;'Be he foe or friend, be he foul or clean,

&gt;brood of Morgoth or bright Vala,

&gt;Elda or Maia or Aftercomer,

&gt;Man yet unborn upon Middle-earth,

&gt;neither law, nor love, nor league of swords,

&gt;dread nor danger, not Doom itself,

&gt;shall defend him from Fëanor, and Fëanor's kin,

&gt;whoso hideth or hoardeth, or in hand taketh,

&gt;finding keepeth or afar casteth

&gt;a Silmaril. This swear we all:

&gt;death we will deal him ere Day's ending,

&gt;woe unto World's end! our word hear thou,

&gt;Eru Allfather! To the everlasting

&gt;Darkness doom us if our deed faileth.

&gt;On the holy mountain hear in witness

&gt;and our vow remeber, Manwë and Varda!'

-----------------------------------------------------------

&gt;'Turn back! Turn back! Seek the pardon of the Valar lest their curse fall upon you! ...Tears unnumbered ye shall shed; but if ye go further, be assured that the Valar will fence Valinor against you, and shut you out, so that not even the echo of your lamentation shall pass over the mountains.

&gt;Lo! on the House of Fëanor the wrath of the gods lieth from the West into the uttermost East, and upon all that will follow them it shall be laid also. Their Oath shall drive them, and yet betray them, and ever snatch away the very treasures that they have sword to pursue. To evil end shall all things turn that they begin well; and by the treason of kin unto kin, and the fear of treason, shall this come to pass. The Dispossessed shall they be for ever.

&gt;'Behold! Ye have spilled the blood of your kindred unrighteously and have stained the land of Aman. For blood ye shall render blood, and beyond Aman ye shall dwell in Death's shadow. For know now that though Eru appointed unto you to die not in Eä, and no sickness may assail you, yet slain may ye be, and slain ye shall be: by weapon and by torment and by grief; and your houseless spirits shall come then to Mandos. There long shall ye abide and yearn for your bodies and find little pity though all whom ye have slain should entreat for you. And those that endure in Middle-earth and come not to Mandos, they shall grow weary of the world as with a great burden, and shall wane, and become as shadows of regret before the younger race that cometh after. The Valar have spoken.'"

"Kind of an outsider... please don't flame me... Looking for the most melodic and symphonic fantasy themed stuff (like Twilight Force)","I like Rhapsody, DragonForce, and Twilight Force. A lot of other stuff hasn't really grabbed me yet. 

I know Blind Guardian, Falconer, Sonata Arctica, and Freedom Call are really popular around here... I haven't been able to really get into them the way I have with the three bands above. 

I would say a requirement would be other instruments besides guitars and drums. Keyboards at least, but the more symphonic the better. 

Thanks for the help. 

**Edit: I just wanna say in case anyone ever comes back to read this that you guys are awesome. Nicest/most welcoming metal community I've ever come across. Thank you.**"
"Kind of an outsider... please don't flame me... Looking for the most melodic and symphonic fantasy themed stuff (like Twilight Force)","Well I think Nightwish is one of the obvious answears when it comes to more symphonic stuff:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NnCg4lSKVM

If you are in to fantasy themed lyrics and not afraid of folk elements, then you should check out elvenking as well:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN9j3nlMwao

And If you think ""harder"" stuff might work for you as well, then Equilibrium is one of the greatest bands ever:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHy81GG6k2o"
"Kind of an outsider... please don't flame me... Looking for the most melodic and symphonic fantasy themed stuff (like Twilight Force)","Thank you. I'm familiar with Nightwish and Elvenking. Gonna check out Equilibrium now. 

**edit**: Equilibrium is pretty awesome and I'll listen to them whenever I'm in the mood for heavier stuff but it's not really what I'm looking for at the moment"
"Kind of an outsider... please don't flame me... Looking for the most melodic and symphonic fantasy themed stuff (like Twilight Force)","[**Pathfinder's**](http://youtu.be/uhKXPWtGJ38) first album *Beyond the Space, Beyond the Time* is a masterpiece, and their second album is pretty great too. Unfortunately, they've lost their singer &amp; his replacement isn't exactly up to par imo.


[**Fairyland's**](http://youtu.be/LMLrVYc18Ao) album *Of Wars In Osyrhia*  is fantastic as well


And if you like that, you'll probably like [**Dark Moor's**](http://youtu.be/eXOly5-lBjU) *The Hall of the Olden Dreams* and *The Gates of Oblivion* since they feature the same vocalist as *Of Wars In Osyrhia*.


Also, if you haven't checked out all of [**Luca Turilli's**](http://youtu.be/tSJ633aoyfc) work, you definitely should! Since you're a fan of rhapsody and all. His album *King of the Nordic Twlight* is a classic and his other work is great too.

I'm honestly surprised no one has mentioned these, they seem to fit your initial description more so than anything else, though perhaps you've heard of them already"
"Kind of an outsider... please don't flame me... Looking for the most melodic and symphonic fantasy themed stuff (like Twilight Force)","Wasn't sure if someone was gonna mention Pathfinder, but so glad you did.

Beyond the Space Beyond the Time is one of my favourite albums of all time and space."
"Kind of an outsider... please don't flame me... Looking for the most melodic and symphonic fantasy themed stuff (like Twilight Force)","I would just like to add that Fairyland's **Score to a New Beginning** is superb, OP should check out both ;)"
"Kind of an outsider... please don't flame me... Looking for the most melodic and symphonic fantasy themed stuff (like Twilight Force)","second score to a new beginning, i love that album."
"Kind of an outsider... please don't flame me... Looking for the most melodic and symphonic fantasy themed stuff (like Twilight Force)","I've never been a huge fan of **[Kamelot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Trjxuc6Q2c)**, but I think they may be exactly what you're looking for. Since I'm not huge into them, that may not be the best (or most representative) song by them, but the video is fucking awesome regardless. So I implore you to investigate further, particularly with the album the Black Halo. Male vocals (exclusively?)  

**[Celesty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNf9lWNG5ls)** is another band that I would suggest that is very symphonic and pretty awesome. Male vocals

**[Amberian Dawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RTJzxZGaxA)** looks like it might be promising for what you're looking for. Female vocals  
**[Ancient Bards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeszIVnvo6o)** is another one. Female vocals  
**[Bane of Winterstorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88RBTSsHVmY)** is pretty sweet, a little closer to pure symphonic than power metal. Male + Female vocals  
**[Battlelore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTlU-NYBi7A)** is awesome, specifically for their dedication to singing about Lord of the Rings. They're also more symphonic/epic than power. Beauty and the beast vocals  
**[Dreamtale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAZsyF8yo8)** is one I'm not too familiar with, but they sound pretty sweet and symphonic. Male vocals with male and female backing vocals  
Shout out for **[Keldian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF0rubiOdwg)**, although I figure you've already heard them and they're space themed, not fantasy. Male vocals  
**[Kemilon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsC1v6DP7OE)** is along the same lines as Keldian (name even sounds similar :/), and it sounds like they've got some crazy synth/electronic stuff going? maybe that works for you, I dunno. Male vocals  "

"Do you even Celt, bro?","The first thread has Mago de Oz mentioned. The main reason you don't see them mentioned a lot is because they've only had a couple albums that can be considered power metal, and their older material is by far their most popular."

Fellow warriors, welcome to the non-lazy edition of my monthly release post! I went and actually listened to the full albums, and below you can find my ultra-biased opinions and a 1-to-10-scale rating of each album. The Power Metal 2015 playlist will remain the same; that is, one song per release. Applying the same level of scrutiny as I do in my DPM series would be overkill.

*This does mean my Avantasia writeup is gonna be delayed...*

*****  
###Fazermint's ultra-biased opinions  
**Angra**: *Secret Garden* is the first Angra album that I've checked out, what with me being relatively new to the genre and all. This is also the first Angra album to be fronted by Fabio Lione, the fabulous lion, whom you know from Rhapsody of Fire among other things. The album has a very impressive line-up of guest musicians. There are too many to mention that are doing choirs and backup vocals, but *Simone Simons* of Epica sings on the title track.  
My favorite song from this album remains the opening track and lead single, **Newborn Me**. I dig the guitar riff and the keyboard segment before the vocals start. Fabio sounds great as always, and this song has the best chorus of the album, IMO. The instrumental segment is awesome, starting with some progressive riffs, followed by some acoustic guitar, and finished off with an awesome guitar solo.    
The rest of the album is packed with good songs. The main reason for me liking the songs is the instrumentation and the guitar solos, they're simply stellar. I don't think this album is Fabio's best work. Anyway, the opener is followed by two awesome tracks, ""Black Hearted Soul"" and ""Final Light"". After that, however, the album sees a bit of a weak middle part. ""Storm of Emotions"" is a calm song that doesn't do much for me. ""Violet Sky"" is equally unimpressive. ""Secret Garden"" sounds pretty much like an Epica track, and not a particularly good one. I mean, Simone Simons sings awesomely, but... yawn. ""Upper Levels"" ups the game again, with a nifty acoustic guitar intro. This is probably my #2 track on this album. Fabio's vocals are more ambitious here than on other songs, and that works in the song's favor. Some solid bass guitars in this song, and the guitar solo is quick and awesome. ""Crushing Room"" with Dora Pesch is another decent track. I don't care much for Dora's vocals, but the chorus is good and the instrumentation solid, and dat guitar solo, son. ""Perfect Symmetry"" is another good track with killer guitars between verses, great vocals by Fabio, and a pretty intense solo segment. The finisher, ""Silent Call"" is a weak, calm song. It's perhaps intentional, since it is an appropriate ending if you listen to the whole album in one go.  
To sum it up, *Secret Garden* is a quality outing by a quality band. The instrumentation is stellar, and Fabio is one hell of a vocalist. A slight disappointment is that Fabio's voice doesn't always *soar* above the music. I'm gonna give this a score of **8/10**

**Orden Ogan**: This is a band that I had just recently fallen in love with.  The tracks ""The Things we Believe In"" and ""To the End"" from the previous album are two of my favorite tracks right now. Forget that, we're talking about *Ravenhead* now. Beginning with my favorite track of the album: **F.E.V.E.R**. Piano + choir intro, after which some pretty sick riffs are thrown at you. The album is full of these. Vocally, Fever impresses with a sweet, catchy verse. Already after the first chorus, we get the coolest solo on the album. A song full of energy and melody.  
Then the other good tracks. ""Ravenhead"" is pretty damn good, being the fastest track on the album. The instrumentation is good, though perhaps a bit repetitive. The vocals are decent enough, although I only feel like singing along for that one line, ""*all you have to do is leave the ones you love behind*"". ""Here at the End of the World"" is less melodic than most of the other songs, but has a great pace, brilliant chorus, and of course a kickass guitar solo. ""Sorrow is your Tale"" is more melodic, with particularly great drums and great vocals.  
""The Lake"" starts off with the best intro on the album, but the intensity goes away when the guy starts singing. It's a decent song, but I expected something more intense after hearing that awesome intro. ""Evil Lies in Every Man"" is an all right song, but slightly ruined by the silly intro. This is the kind of shit where, if you have friends over and this pops up on the playlist, you have to explain that the intro is just weird. Totally unnecessary, the rest of the song is cool.  
If you feel like having a calm, non-intense Orden Ogan song, ""Reason to Give"" would be your best bet. ""Deaf Among the Blind"" is an all right song, nice and fast. ""In Grief and Chains"" is a random instrumental track... *shrug*. ""Too Soon"" is just a boring ending. To sum it up, I really like this album. I do feel that it lacks some character compared to *To the End*. I'm going to award this album with an **8/10**.

**Serious Black**: Contrary to what the name might imply, Serious Black is a nice, regular Power Metal band with only clean vocals. Yay! It's a new supergroup that's not a supergroup at all! The band is likened to a supergroup because of the impressive line-up of well-known musicians from various bands. But they actually form a permanent band. We've got Urban Breed on vocals (Trail of Murder, Project Arcadia), Roland Grapow (Masterplan) and Dominik Sebastian (Edenbridge) on guitars, Thomen Stauch (ex-Blind Guardian), Jan Vacik on keyboards, and Mario Lochert on bass.  
The album is very reminiscent of Masterplan, particularly in the *Aeronautics* era (Grapow says hello). And that, my friends, is a very good thing. I'll introduce this album through my favorite song, **My Mystic Mind**. An epic-vibe, melodic guitar intro lets you know you're in for a treat. I absolutely dig the vocals, and also the lyrics, in this one. ""My mystic mind twist my dreams and turns, tells me I will burn, tells me I will BUUUURN!""    
The rest of the album is generally pretty awesome, with only a couple of weaker songs. ""Sealing my Fate"" is a slow-paced that can't quite compare with the rest of the album. The title track is a ballad. I don't know about all of you, but I don't care overly much for ballads. ""Temple of the Sun"" is just some interlude nonsense. The rest of the album is top-notch, and I'd just recommend listening to the whole thing. I'd like to mentions two more tracks, though, that you absolutely have to listen to if you like ""My Mystic Mind"". The first one being ""Akhenaton"", which is just fine throughout and has a really great chorus. The other one is ""Trail of Murder"" which is obviously a nod to one of Urban Breed's other bands. Great song, too. As for the album, I'd say it's worth a solid **9/10**.

**Vexillum**: An Italian Power / Folk Metal band with high-profile guest vocalists such as Hansi Kürsch. What can go wrong? Well, quite some stuff actually. If the songwriting just isn't interesting, an album can't really gain much momentum. You can throw in folk instruments in your music, but that doesn't do much unless the vocals are catchy. The song **Over the Clouds** is the only song where I feel they really pull that off. The band's main vocalist, Dario Vallesi, has a decent power metal voice, and delivers a catchy tune with this song. Guest vocalist Chris Bay does a few backup lines, but he's ultimately sounding worse than Vallesi and it'd just be better if he weren't there. Looking away from this nitpick, ""Over the Clouds"" is a pretty good song. Not song of the month material, but still recommended.  
I only found myself caring about two of the rest of the songs. One being ""Fire and Blood"", featuring Hansi. Instrumentation is okay, vocals are okay. My main gripe with this song is the chaotic chorus. Vallesi and Hansi are alternating lines, but it's way too messy and incongruent. But, you know, this song has Hansi so check it out. The third song I liked is ""Run Runaway"", which is a Slade cover song. It's kinda silly sounding, but tons of fun to listen to. It's actually pretty well done, too.  
The rest of the album just doesn't cut it for me. Vallesi doesn't always sound equally good, and most of the songs lack catchiness and are otherwise uninteresting. It's not necessarily bad, but they're not exactly memorable tracks. I give this album a **6/10**.

**Visigoth**: A Heavy / Power Metal band from the US. I don't listen to much USPM, but dammit this stuff is surprisingly good. I say surprisingly, because it is a debut album, and the band name and album art made me expect something else entirely. The album consists of only 9 songs, but most of them are over 6 minutes long. Jake Rogers is the vocalist, and his rough-y vocal style fits well with the instrumentation which is more heavy than melodic. The guy is pretty damn talented, too. The song that didn't spearhead the promotion of the album, but that should have spearheaded it, is **Creature of Desire**. This is a song from their EP *The Final Spell* from 2012. Maybe they didn't want to promote the new album with an old song. It is still, by far, the most epic song on the album. The album version has received some re-mastering touches compared to the EP version, but they're more or less the same. A real bad-ass intro riff topped off with a great power metal scream leads you into a super-intense song. It's definitely the fastest and most power-metaly song on the album. The vocals are insanely good! Super-sick guitar in-between verses and super-sick guitar solo! Wow.  
As a Heavy / Power album, you'll find that the album is largely non-melodic. In fact, their instrumentation is kind of old school, sounding somewhat like Iron Maiden. The main attraction, then, is Jake Roger's vocals and, of course, the well-written songs. The album is about half fast tracks, half slow(er) tracks. The lead single ""Dungeon Master"" is one of the faster tracks, which kicks some serious ass. It's got excellent guitars, great vocals, and basically just the whole package. The title track is one of the slower ones, which is also pretty damn good. Basically the whole album consists of good tracks, perhaps with the exception of ""Iron Brotherhood"", which I found to be the most boring song on the album. ""From the Arcane Mists of Proph"" is nearly 10 minutes long, but has some awesome segments. All in all, a really awesome album, **9/10**.

**Blind Guardian**: Hey, I went and listened to my first full Blind Guardian album ever. Aren't you proud of me? I'm not a big fan of Blind Guardian, and here's why. If this album is any indication, their songs generally follow a structure that lacks peaks. By this, I mean that the songs slowly build up your expectations of, for example, fantastic choruses. Then they fall short by not having anything like that. More than anything else, Blind Guardian is more about the *journey* rather than the destination. This is not a criticism at all - it's a perfectly valid style. For me, though, it's not really a compelling style. Don't get me wrong, though. The instrumentation sounds excellent, despite the sub-par production quality. It's the structure, and length, of the songs that ruins it a little bit for me.  
Naturally, **Twilight of the Gods** is my favorite track on the album. It's the only one that resembles the Power Metal that I'm used to, in terms of structure. Other songs that I found enjoyable are ""Prophecies"", ""At the Edge of Time"", ""Sacred Mind"", and ""Grand Parade"".  
I sincerely hope, though, that this is far from Blind Guardian's best work. I believe the album is worth an **8/10**.

A concept album and a collaboration between metal legend Jørn Lande (Jorn) and guitarist/songwriter Trond Holte. Holte has worked with Jorn on his latest solo album, but is best known for being the guitarist/songwriter for the glam rock band Wig Wam. [Here's an example of Holter rockin' it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US5NedSGPcA). As for the actual release, it's not really reminiscent of anything Jorn has done before. It's less heavy, there's a general influence of classical music, and some songs are duets with female vocalist Lena Fløitmoen. I found the lead single, ""Walking on Water"", to be fairly enjoyable. Holter's guitar solo is pretty smooth, generally less speed-oriented than you folks probably prefer, though. The title track is enjoyable, but it sounds more like jazz than anything else. I enjoy jazz occasionally, but it's generally not something I find myself revisiting. As much as I love everything Jorn does, I can't omit the fact that this album is pretty much forgettable. I believe a **7/10** is in order.  
* **Level 10**: *Chapter 1* - [Cry no More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02NNqNocpY0) (Heavy Metal). Allen &amp; Lande may not be doing a release together, but they've both got a new release out this month. Level 10 is another new collaboration, this time between Russel Allen (Symphony X) and Mat Sinner (Primal Fear). This is a regular Heavy Metal album, and most of the tracks have a slight touch of soul music. Allen has a powerhouse of a voice, and the instrumentation is well done. I found ""Cry no More"" to be the most memorable track on the album. Other memorable tracks are ""When the Nighttime Comes"" and ""In for the Kill"". Beyond that, the album ended up being quite generic metal. It's redeeming feature is the fact that Russel Allen provides the vocals. I can recommend the album only if you *really* like Russel Allen. Think of this as a heavier version of his solo album. I'm gonna give this album a **7/10** as well.

"Fazermint's favorite Power Metal releases: January [Revised edition]","&gt;This is the kind of shit where, if you have friends over and this pops up on the playlist, you have to explain that the intro is just weird.

Maybe it's just confirmation bias or something, but this seems to becoming more common with power metal releases...

&gt;It's the only one that resembles the Power Metal that I'm used to, in terms of structure. Other songs that I found enjoyable are ""Prophecies"", ""At the Edge of Time"", ""Sacred Machine"", and ""Grand Parade"".

I'm sort of surprised that you left out [The Holy Grail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPTz7z04_OM#t=37m52s), which is easily the most traditional power metal song on the album and has a mindblowingly amazing chorus.

As I said, that wasn't a criticism, and I don't necessarily think the choruses are *weak*. Just, in my experience they don't soar above the verses. So I get the impression that BG sacrifices that certain ""dynamicity"" for other kinds of dynamicities."
"Fazermint's favorite Power Metal releases: January [Revised edition]","I'd say they're pretty damn diverse.

It seems to me that the verses on many of their songs differ in structure/melody between the first and second etc. Which creates a much more complex and interesting structure, which I enjoy much more than a predictable verse/chorus/verse/chorus/solo/chorus"
"Fazermint's favorite Power Metal releases: January [Revised edition]","You said Sacred Machine is one of your favourite songs from Beyond the Red Mirror which isn't actually a song from the album.

**SinuataBouquet's Recommendation of the Week**

Nothing of particular interest this week, I would say. I think Fortress Under Siege had some strong moments, and Zaria's folk tune got stuck in my head for a moment as it was pretty catchy. I don't think I'll be carrying that much with me from this week, but I would turn to **ShadowIcon** if you are looking for actual power metal this week. It's fairly generic stuff, but it explores a few different stages of calmness and I feel it's chill enough to bang my head to for a couple of minutes.

---

As for the highlight, I feel like dropping it. There are a lot of good threads where the power metal year of 2014 can be discussed, and I don't feel I'm bringing much to the table. I'd prefer to keep this post a little bit more clean anyways.

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/15 - 12/21)","We're winding down! So it turns out I end up listening to all of these albums in full anyway sometime during the week. So I guess these opinions of mine are mainly for others to enjoy...

My opinions (based upon previews only):

* **Fortress Under Siege:** *ft. Hannibal*...ok..Anyways, instantly that guy's voice reminds me a lot of modern-day Bruce Dickinson. Not so much as [Attick Demons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg-RzE-a6qs), but you get the point. It seems a bit generic and it's recalling a lot of the Project Arcadia album from earlier this year, but it's solid all-around. There's no real complaints; it's vocally-driven with the rest of the instrumentation seemingly an afterthought, but it works decently well. It's nothing ground-breaking or monumental, but it gets the job done. Just like last time, I'll check out a second track on these iffy previews. ""[Hate What We Like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLznAN86qyE)"" is much more powerful as a preview for the album. I'm really digging those synths in the verses, and the singer's voice is much more powerful than in the previous song. I'd definitely recommend giving this second track a listen. 

* **ShadowIcon:** ...whereas this singer reminds me of Kiara Laetita from Skylark *shudder*. Although I will say it's refreshing to see such high productions from Slovenia. Also, what is a Chloe Grace-Moretz lookalike doing in this video? Anyways, the singer's definitely the weakest point of this song, but it's bearable. The symphonic passages and the synths are what caught my attention the most upon first listen, so hopefully that singer can grow on me. Her lows seem to resonate the most with me, but its her highs on the chorus that just trouble me a little bit. No second song preview for this one.

* **ТриумфаторЪ (Triumphator):** Have I ever mentioned that I can't listen to Slavic languages? I know I said I was pretty un-picky when it came to vocals, but just the enunciation of it doesn't sit right with me, much like Japanese doesn't bode well with many people here. The slightly-lacking production aside, it's just not anything special. Very derivative and dime-a-dozen. Fazermint put it well: it's monotone and repetitive. No second song here either, and I'm not sure I'd want one.

* **Zaria:** Slovenian vocals. Great. Same issue as the last one. The vocals just irk me a bit, and the rest of the song is a little bland, but now there's folky stuff going on too, so I guess that's the difference. The song kind of just plods along uninterestingly, and I frankly couldn't care any less about it once we're 4 minutes into it. Get your shit together, Eastern Europe!

What I missed last week:

* **Light Bringer:** I was really hoping this one would have a preview link. I've waited too damn long this year to get a single good power metal live DVD, and this seems to be my best shot. Light Bringer is great, so hopefully this DVD ends up online at some point.

* **Voodoma:** The vocalists on this one are way more competent than the last couple albums. The female clean vocals and the male cleans are used pretty well together, and it's promising, but that's it. I just hope it's not like a lot of other generic Germany heavy metal bands. The female vocals on this one definitely set it apart, but considering they're just guest vocals, I'm still not entirely sold. YouTube just uploaded [the whole album here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh68lJlxjZmDl3CnS0XoecA/videos), so I decided to check out track #2, ""[Secret Circle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRpP7GD9H9c)"". And it's more of the same. If anything, I'm excited about the progressive tinges and the possibility of something more than just ""GERMAN HEAVY METAL"", but I wouldn't say either of the songs have been memorable. 

So, in conclusion, maybe check out the first two albums, and watch the Light Bringer DVD if you find it somewhere online in the future. I gotta get to work on Top 30 list of 2014 (my top two albums aren't even power metal this year, and that's terrifying to me). Comments are welcome, unless you're /u/realkman666, in which case they're demanded."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/15 - 12/21)","The troll has been summoned, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to troll about? I'm a big Versailles fan, but I don't know Light Bringer too much."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/15 - 12/21)","*Scenes of Infinity* and *Genesis* are Light Bringer at their best, if you need a starting point to listen to them. Try listening to ""[noah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc8tHKdNieY)"" for a good idea of what they sound like.

**Edit:** I just saw your other comment here. If you liked ""noah"", you should like Light Bringer."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/15 - 12/21)","They're fantastic, but the prices are outrageous.

Fun fact, first result on Amazon.ca is Bringers of Light, by Damnation Angels."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/15 - 12/21)","You're just toying with me now. Besides, that's a great album.

Yeah, importing anything from Japan is outrageously expensive. It's the one place I don't feel guilty pirating music from (even though I eventually end up buying most of it because I'm weak-willed)."

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/15 - 12/21)","I never said I didn't love him. I love that Damnation Angels album, and I love *Ocean of Opportunity* to an extent. If anything, I've given him a fair chance, more than I can say about most people. His newest album is horrendous, though, and his covers seem kind of careless nowadays. I just don't like when people post his videos every day. It would be the same if people posted Blind Guardian every day."

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/15 - 12/21)","Yay, it's that time of the week again! Appropriate gif is appropriate (I had a part in the drama with my inappropriate PelleK comment last week. I've taken the criticisms to heart, no more vulgar comments from me!)

* **Fortress Under Siege**: This is decent. It's got some wonderfully quirky moments that jumps out above the otherwise generic sound of this preview. The vocalist is pretty damn good, actually.  
* **ShadowIcon**: A very vocal-focused song (or band, idk). The female vocalist is all right, a little more on the pop side of the spectrum. Sadly, the musical part is pretty lackluster, and serve as background for the voice. There's a short keyboard/guitar solo, but to me it sounds like they're just going through the motions, having a solo just because that's the standard song format. This is not bad by any means, but it's pretty weak in terms of both symphonic metal and power metal.  
* **Triumphator**: All right guys. This is an EP. Apparently not a debut EP - I checked Metal Archives and the band debuted with a full release earlier this year. Onto the preview. I don't think there's really any other way to say it: It's just bad. It has the low production quality of a debut EP in the early 2000's. The preview song is, in a word, monotone. Repetitive drums / riffs and un-melodic vocals. It's just not doing it for me.  
* **Zaria**: This is a style I don't personally like, and I won't deride it for being what it is. What you get: Folk metal that is, correct me if I'm wrong, a little bleak musically. There's both a male and female voice. The male voice switches between three vocal styles (weird nasal-sounding vocals, regular vocals, and growling), and the female voice is in soprano style. It has some decent moments, I guess. I'm not big enough on folk metal to really say if it's good or bad.  
* **Light Bringer**: No preview. DVD release, anyway.
* **Voodoma**: If I am to describe this with one word, the word of choice would probably be *weird*. The frontman kinda looks like your average joe neighbor. Anyway, he sings all right. From what I gather, there's a female guest vocalist, who also sings all right. The song is rather slow and monotone, kind of *weird*. The interaction between the two vocalists in the video only contribute more *weird*. Watch it for the fun, if anything.

Yesyes, slow week for power metal. I can't really recommend anything."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/15 - 12/21)","Totally forgot to add the Triumphator-link, and as for Light Bringer I forgot to remove it, as I didn't find any preview material. It's fixed now - thanks for pointing out the mistakes!"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/15 - 12/21)","Thanks for the fixes! Great work, as usual. Updated my post accordingly."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/15 - 12/21)","Great, Tony Kakko revisits a classic to fix his lyrics and ShadowIcon mess it up in the damn title. Zaria is pretty cool. With a bit more energy, I'd be behind this all the way. 

Bad week for guitar tones overall.


This is not from the new DVD, but I guess it's similar to what you can expect from Light Bringer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk01RyB7kNA

""We are still looking for young Metal Bands . Currently we are especially interested in Stoner Rock, Psychedelic Metal, Doom, Post Metal, Progressive Styles and anything cutting edge and forward looking. We are closed for all traditional styles of Metal and will only consider those based on recommendations. Please digest the following rules carefully before submitting your songs:
 
1. If you are a Newcomer you should be young, very young ! The younger the better ! It takes years to build the base for a Rock Band. We are not in the Pop Business ! The average age should be well under 25 ! Don’t apply if this is not the case.
 
2. We are only interested in Bands. No Solo Projects or Duo’s!
 
3. Be unique within your Sub Genre. Make a difference. Don’t imitate your Heroes (the bands on your shirts). We are not interested in clones – not even good ones. Beware of the unwritten Metal Dogmas ! We are freethinkers and don't like any dogmas ! Rules stop you from being inventive and different. Mould your style the way you need it. And foremost: write great songs, don’t get lost in your technical abilities.
 
4. Don’t apply if you are not commited to sacrifice your job, career or girlfriend in exchange for the stony and rocky, yet adventurous and challenging way to rock stardom. Students beware! The digital revolution is upon us and records are just a means to secure live shows and therewith generate income. Records these days barely pay for the production costs of records.
 
5. Don’t apply if you are not a Live Band ! You should at least have perfomed a minimum of twelve shows over the last 18 month.
 
6. Your Singer should have personality and charisma – he should be an outstanding performer . His/her voice should be a means of communication – no growls please or very minimal. The drummer should be a maniac, a force of power and precision, with the iron will of a bull. Giving the band the drive forward. The base player complements the rythm: strengthens it so that it can develop it’s full potential. The guitar (s) define the acrobatic skills of any Metal Unit as well as the song structures through inventive riffing and great melodies.
 
7. Create a visual image which reflects your musical style. Give your band a face. Rise above the nameless crowds... And within the band image, think about individuality and personality of each band member. Choose between facelessness and the risk of being special.
Organise your Army of Super-Fans by using all the means available in this digital age. Where is your Digital-Fanclub ? How many fans can you activate with one call ? Do not think any more in terms of sold CD’s. Physical product (especially (CD’s ) is dying fast. The power of Relationships is much more important.
 
8. Your application should include the following: a band photo, a band bio (only the facts to keep it short) profiles of each band member, lyric sheets, a list of your live activities during the last 18 month, web links to all relevant web sites, link to an upload server for your songs, a mission statement about the bands goals.
 
9. Also be aware that this label is only our instrument to find suitable bands for management as labels in their traditional function are a dying breed. We understand the release of a bands first album internationally as a testing ground for potential and commitment. Only those with a burning desire to break free of the shackles of employment will make it in the highly competetive music scene.""

"The guidelines of metal","That's not what it takes to be accepted and popular. Saying that a band can't sound like anyone and needs to be progressive is doing just the opposite. Let the progressive bands progress on something but don't pigeonhole them because that's literally the opposite of progressive. 

Bands of guys over 30 are almost always better than younger bands, because they are more experienced and better players. This sounds like the kind of record label that ruins bands.

I'd rather listen to a well-engineered studio album, perhaps with a guitar solo that took 12 tries to get it just right. I'd like to listen to it at a volume that I control, not through a set of ear plugs that'll just muffle the high end, and in a setting that doesn't reek of beer and weed."

Listening to the genre for so long, stuff just becomes predictable and cliche, so stuff like this is what I look for.

"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","You're almost as bad of a poster as /u/mushmancat is. Stop with the obvious trollbait. This is the third time you've posted one of PelleK's covers with the same sarcastic and provocative title, and it's really a waste of everyone's time. "
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","By the way, I've discovered a bunch of bands thanks to mushie, whether he dislikes them or not, so suck on that."
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","If you don't think this cover sounds a lot better than most of his tripe, you can't dislike nor appreciate anything music-related. Leave the hall and fuck all the haters. This one wasn't that bad and you know it, shill. If you think he's so amazing, why don't you post his stuff so he get more views? I'm the one doing that and I'm not even a big fan, so what does that say about you?"
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","I don't even like PelleK. What are you talking about? But the last time I checked, at least he has the guts to post his covers on YouTube for the world to see. That's more than I can say for 95% of this subreddit. Constructive criticism and expressing your opinion are what you should be doing in these cases when you don't like someone's video; making it your goal to just flat-out mock and ridicule them is childish and juvenile. To be honest, it's not like I expected much more out of someone whose username is ""realkman666""."
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","What is the opinion of posting a video? Watch it and judge for yourself, a lot of people like him, most of the time I don't. So fucking what? He spreads the metal love his own way and I have no problem with that.  

Hey, you dissed my username! Fucking A-level shit right there! "
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","You don't see me posting Skylark videos every week and going ""Look how bad this is. Everyone laugh at this bullshit!"". That's exactly what you're doing with these PelleK videos. If you just titled these videos by what they were (PelleK - Symphony of the Night cover), I'd give you a pass. 
But you're just being obnoxious and insufferable for the sake of being obnoxious and insufferable."
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","At least he's taking the time to listen to all these PelleK songs! Some part of him must enjoy these..."
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","That's a really twisted way of looking at it. You could say he's a closet PelleK fan."

"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","Anybody noticed Pellek's new album ""Cloud Dancers"" is out?

(I haven't listened to it but the title track is boring)"
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","Yeah, it's in the new releases post that's stickied right now. The title track seems to be the most boring of the bunch. ""Tempest"", the only other song I checked out, is actually pretty good."
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","Yeah, but I don't do iTunes and his air guitar skills in the video threw me off. :/"
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","so someone needs to tell me why PelleK is actually so hated here. "
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","While I don't think it's enough to justify the constant ridicule:

1. He sounds very nasally/whiny in his upper ranges, which he tends to significantly overuse. I actually think he sounds pretty good in his lower ranges.

2. He comes off as over-confident. From his general attitude, to some of the songs he's written or chosen, to the first issue where he overuses his weaker high vocals.

3. I guess people don't like his face?"
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","Eh I'd say his high vocals in reality are probably a lot stronger than many power metal singers would be in a live setting. While him sounding whiny is kind of a personal preference, he's got a shit ton of control and power in his higher register."
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","He's not really hated. He just doesn't bother listening to a song before performing it, so he just sounds off, out of tune, out of touch and a big douche that thinks he's great while murdering melody and phrasing. He's very able, but he needs a teacher badly."
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","so I might be wrong and he may just be butchering a song, but you bring up something that i think is a problem on this sub. Covering a song does not mean imitation, in fact you should change it up if you're actually a singer. A lot of people here want a cover to sound exactly the same tonally, and that's just not what a cover is. In fact, if it is that, it's usually boring as shit. So what a long of singers do is homogenize the melody to change things up, make it theirs, and possibly make it a little easier to sing. Placement in singing is also a way to make things easier, especially if you're singing this kind of stuff often. "
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","As a guitarist, what he does is akin to using heavy distortion on everything, banging on the whammy bar at the end of every phrase and soloing over the intro of every song. He has a possibly good voice, but he uses it in a clueless way 95% of the time. He's not a good musician."
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","I'm a guitarist too and those comparisons don't make a lot of sense to me. Are you saying that the stylistic choices are over the top? No shit, it's power metal, those are also the choices he makes to personalize his song. Whether you like it or not, that's your personal taste. But for a metal singer to be able to improvise the way he does, he's definitely a good musician."
"Dragonforce cover to kill all Dragonforce covers","He has no sense of music, he's not improvising."

But at least, it's not the same shit all bands do where they have the band members pretending to play the song and some bullshit story happening in the back or the vocalist painted creepy looking at you sideways the entire time. Yeah, you can call this is just trying to be edgy but if you listen to the album, it's an exercise in brutality and ""disgusting-ness"" and i find the music video to be fitting and quite frankly, it was the only one i saw all the way to the end in a long time..."
"So what's your favourite music video this year?","Uhhhhh, this is NSFL. I'm pretty jaded when it comes to stuff like this, but I imagine plenty of others aren't. So unless you want some ""blackened sludge metal"" along with a video just trying to shock the viewer, don't watch this, especially if you're queasy.

I'd go as far as to call it tasteless. At least a band like [Skeletonwitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBnhx7N1y5Y) understands what subtlety is. The video for ""Unending, Everliving"" may describe what you wrote in your comment to a T, but at least it doesn't look like outtakes from Begotten or one of the August Underground movies."
"So what's your favourite music video this year?","It's important to understand that I only watched this once, I'm not the kind of guy that finds this exciting or appealing or interesting for that matter (not that there's anything wrong with that... maybe a little). However, watching it once left enough of a psychological mark that i recall most parts of it and i haven't had a musical video who had such an impact on me.

The video is in fact truly disgusting and some people might not have the stomach (not metal) but it's not tasteless at all. Bands like, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Suffocation, they all are the embodiment of aggressiveness and brutality and their music reflects that but whatever music videos they have ever released are really quite tame, whereas this one fully embraces what they envision in their music, or at least, i feel like it does.

You can call it tasteless but this is the first time I've seen a ""brutal"" band have the balls to create a music video that reflects the songs they've created."

But it's just an arthouse ""shock"" film. There's plenty of them out there. The music definitely works to its advantage, but I don't understand how leaving a mental scar on you means it's your favorite music video. Of course, I'm not trying to belittle or undervalue your opinion; I just don't understand how disturbing images can equate to your favorite music video.

Other bands do this kind of gory, psychological shock value thing too. Cattle Decapitation got a lot of press this year for [this music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP1kQ9twFQg) (MAJOR NSFL ALERT). You can't be looking at major signed bands like Cannibal Corpse and Deicide if you want that style of music video.

Besides, we're on /r/powermetal...at least keep it closely related to power metal when discussing music videos!"
"So what's your favourite music video this year?","I think Cattle Decapitation gets away with that video because it depicts exactly what the lyrics are. It also happens to be one of the best death metal songs i've ever heard.  "
"Blazon Stone - The Tale Of Vasa",""
"Blazon Stone - The Tale Of Vasa","My favourite song from the best Running Wild album since 1998!"
"2 Hours Left on the Sonata Arctica Tribute Album Kickstarter, last 2 hours to pre-order it!",""
"Pathfinder - Crowdfunding Campaign","Hey! One of my favorite bands of all time recently just started a crowdfunding campaign for a few music videos of their songs. One of them being a song of which they haven't released yet.

They make it seem much more awesome than I do, so Ill just leave this here. 

https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/music-videos-for-pathfinder

Their songs are also relatively easy to find on youtube, so you can give them a look up if you want to."
"Pathfinder - Crowdfunding Campaign","€681 to raise every day for 22 days...I don't think they're gonna make it.

I'm a big fan but I just don't care about music videos. A new track or 2 is nice but offer a crowdfunded new album and I'd be an early backer in a heartbeat. "
"Pathfinder - Crowdfunding Campaign","That's exactly how I feel. If this was funding for a new album, I would have already backed it and I have no doubt the whole thing would have been funded already. Two music videos? No thanks."
"Pathfinder - Crowdfunding Campaign","Yeah, it's quite unfortunate.

I hope they do make a new album soon. They're just great."
"Pathfinder - Crowdfunding Campaign","I think from the link they say one is coming out sometime in 2015"

"Discovering Power Metal: Divine Ascension","###Discovering Power Metal: Divine Ascension  
Today I'll be walking you through the discography of **Divine Ascension**, which has recently caught the attention of many with their surprisingly solid album *Liberator*.

Things aren't going as quickly as I'd like. As a non-finance student taking a finance class for those last required credits, most of my time is spent with my face buried in textbooks to try to understand the madness. FML. But what can ya do. Here's my next review, for your reading pleasure.

[Review Index](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2qlzcx/review_index_discovering_power_metal/)
*****  
###About the band  
**Genre**: Progressive Power Metal  
**Country**: Australia

**Divine Ascension** is a *female-fronted* progressive PM band. They have been active since 2007, which was when they debuted with a demo, and has since brought out two albums. Their latest album was released just a while back, and I caught them in the weekly release thread and instantly became a fan.

Line-up:

* **Luke Wenczel** - Drummer  
* **Karl Szulik** - Lead guitarist  
* **Robert Inglis** - Rhytm guitarist  
* **Jennifer Borg** - Vocalist  
* **David van Pelt** - Keyboardist  
* **Jason Meracis** - Bass guitarist  

Divine Ascension is the first and only band in frontwoman Jennifer Borg's musical career. The same counts for all other members as well, with the exception of Jason Meracis who has also played for the melodeath band *Unknown Addiction*. Any fan of Power Metal is bound to come across multiple of the female-fronted symphonic bands who opt for high-register soprano-style singing. Now, Divine Ascension is not a symphonic band, but I still find the fact that Jennifer Borg sings in a lower register extremely refreshing. Her singing style is somehow a little more down-to-earth and believable. She has shown an incredibly growth as a singer between the two albums.

Familiarize yourself with the band:

* [Red Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PjP-hckyPs) - Excellent example of Jennifer's vocal quality - uploaded by yours truly.  
* [Answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyY7icbJYro) - Their only music video, if you wanna see how they look like. **Note: Terrible song**.  
* [Stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7_frbp6bi8) - Playlist addition #1  
* [Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWqHmZFLQ3U) - Playlist addition #2

*****  
###As the Truth Appears (2011)  
The debut album of Divine Ascension is, in a word, forgettable. I could go on to describe the tracks in length, or I could just tell you to go listen to *Liberator* instead. I'm leaning more towards the latter. Hell, I'll just list the three songs that I found to be worth listening to at all:

* [Visionary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th4T8iFTzyQ)  
* [Vision Divine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwjgucxpxl8)  
* [One Last Caress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM-NeQlWHMU) - Most likely to best track on this album. 

*****  
###Liberator (2014)  
Liberator constitutes a major improvement over the debut album in just about every possible way. Better vocals, better drums, better guitars, more prominent keyboards, and a heavier sound. 

[Dawn Brings no Mercy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKYFdoyU6Ao) is the opening track, with a pretty sweet intro. It's immediately apparent that this album is way more melodic, a welcome improvement. The vocals are sounding pretty good, but beyond the first couple of lines, I don't really find them very interesting. The saving grace of this particular song is the solid instrumentation. The solo segment at about 4:40 in is amazing. It begins with a wicked keyboard solo, moves over to a guitar solo, then switches back to keyboard, and then one last time to guitar. The keyboard parts are pretty damn cool!

**Stronger** ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7_frbp6bi8)) is the first of two playlist additions from this band, and also my favorite of the two. This song is amazing, it totally blows me away. Everything about this song is fantastic. The *entire* song maintains a constant rhythm of one second between the heaviest drum beats, or the highest pitch of the vocal lines, or the most prominent notes of the solo, depending on where you're at in the song. The only exception is in the beginning of the verses, where there are no instruments to accentuate the vocals. I don't know much about composing music, but I don't believe I'm mistaken if I say that's pretty amazing. The instrumentation is nothing short of solid, starting off with some soft keyboard followed by a heavy riff and a combination of keyboards and guitars. The verses are pretty amazing, but what puts this song above the rest of their songs and honestly above most songs in general, is the bridge to the chorus and the chorus itself. The instruments accentuate the vocals perfectly. The guitar solo is amazing as well, starting at around 3:45. The song's got a dramatic vibe to it, not really the most common thing that the power metal crowd is interested in, but I love it!

*Liberator*, the title track, is not really among the most impressive songs on the album. Honestly, it kinda sounds like a pop song (which is not a compliment). The vocals are fine, but apart from the keyboard and guitar solos, the instruments do little to remind you that this is actually power metal. That leads us to the sole reason for listening to this track: the keyboard solo! Starting at around 2:55. I couldn't find a video of this one, but check it out if it ever pops up, if only for the keyboard solo.

**Machine** ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWqHmZFLQ3U)) is the second playlist addition. The intro is delicious, sounding like it could have been Symphony X. The vocals are great, and I like the lyrical theme (the ""common age"" of society - we should all be the same and we don't have to think for ourselves because society does that for us). The chorus will catch you off guard and blow your mind, because there's a moment of silence between the end of the verse and the beginning of the chorus. The chorus is a lot more bombastic, and has a different pace than the rest of the song. Very cool! There's a guitar solo at about 4:15, but it's nothing major. Another really strong song, though!

[Red Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PjP-hckyPs) is a slow and calm song focusing on the vocals. As I said earlier, this song is probably the one that best shows off Jennifer's vocals. They are mainly backed up by piano and synthesizer. If you don't care about non-heavy tracks, feel free to skip this one. I'm generally not into non-heavy tracks either, but I *really* like this one for some reason. It sounds very peaceful despite being about death, and the vocals are just fantastic. ""Oh what a waste, to leave this place that I call home"". Chills. I had to upload this song myself... It's not playlist-worthy because it's just not power metal, but for what it is, attention is definitely deserved.

[The Final Stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhyrPx3Dv8) is another quite pop-y song. The vocals are good, though, and the chorus is pretty catchy. Also here, the instrumentation is a little bland. But hey, it's not a bad song by any means. Also, it was the only other song that has been uploaded to YouTube, so it's got that going for it.

*Hideaway* is the last song I'll mention. This one isn't up on YouTube either, though. It's yet another song that leans a little towards the pop side, but it's heavy enough. The vocals are pretty good, although the chorus isn't as good as the verses. Just another song to check out if it ever pops up.

**NOTE**: The whole album is available on YouTube, but only for people living in the US. It's another upload by ""Topic"", which hates us Europeans and all other non-Americans. But if you are American, you can listen to the whole thing.

*****  
###Conclusion

**TL;DR**: *As the Truth Appears* is forgettable, *Liberator* is awesome.

So I ended up mainly talking about their second album. And really, that's where it's at. I can wholeheartedly recommend *Liberator*. Even if you like that album, I wouldn't recommend the debut album, though. ""Stronger"" has become one of my favorite songs, and ""Machine"" is pretty awesome as well. I'm probably this sub's biggest fan of this album, but I hope all of you will give it a listen and maybe become half as hooked as me!

The next band I'm reviewing is **Neonfly**. I had promised other bands, but ""Heart of the Sun"" is on my head and I want to check out the whole discography (2 albums, I think). Luckily I'm my own boss. I promised to check out Falconer and I will, just not very soon. I'm also a little afraid I won't like it half as much as most of you do, so I'm giving myself some time to get into the band. Other upcoming bands are Secret Sphere, Pythia, Elvenking, Avantasia and Sabaton, in no particular order."
"Discovering Power Metal: Divine Ascension","Sounds like the typical modern progressive power metal band, good but nothing special. Some of the songs are pretty sweet though.

I know you will be doing Neonfly next time but if you could/want I'd love to see you take on a band with a lot more albums, like the ones you stated in the end."
"Discovering Power Metal: Divine Ascension","As a release that came out of *nowhere* (I mean, who had ever heard about this band before?), I found it quite impressive. Not top tier stuff, but impressive nonetheless.

How about I do Avantasia after Neonfly, then? I'm already familiar with their whole discography and it would be a matter of picking songs, so that should be done relatively quickly."
"Discovering Power Metal: Divine Ascension","Yeah, i guess they're fairly unknown, i never heard of them that's for sure. Avantasia after Neonfly sounds like a good plan."
"Discovering Power Metal: Divine Ascension","Avantasia is quite awesome"
"Discovering Power Metal: Divine Ascension","Is it possible to have links to past reviews you have done? (if the original post is too long, post it as a comment) Mostly to know what else has been reviewed and prevent asking for the same bands. And I feel I'm behind on some of the bands."

"Jorn Lande and Trond Holter - Walking on Water - [5:53]","Maybe he's trying to be Dracula?"
"Jorn Lande and Trond Holter - Walking on Water - [5:53]","I wonder if that's what he really was going for..."
"Jorn Lande and Trond Holter - Walking on Water - [5:53]","I can only hope his performance is intended to be silly... He consistently pulls the same faces in all of his videos. He generally just looks fucking angry half of the time.

Luckily his voice more than makes up for it. Trond Holter's got some smooth guitar solos going on, I'm really looking forward to this one."
"Jorn Lande and Trond Holter - Walking on Water - [5:53]","Strange as it seems, the weird faces could be part of what makes his voice sound like it does."
"Jorn Lande and Trond Holter - Walking on Water - [5:53]","Song kicks ass, video is... just open a new tab while listening."
"Jorn Lande and Trond Holter - Walking on Water - [5:53]","Reminds me of [Harry's Uncle](http://media.comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/richard-griffiths.jpg). A less fat, long haired and handle bare mustached Uncle Vernon."
"Jorn Lande and Trond Holter - Walking on Water - [5:53]","I have it on good authority that this album is masterful. If you like concept albums and horror films, you should check this one out, but it's more of a hard rock album than a power metal album."
"Jorn Lande and Trond Holter - Walking on Water - [5:53]","This is one of those songs that may grow on me. I wish the guitar work was stronger"
"Jorn Lande and Trond Holter - Walking on Water - [5:53]","Jorn is so much fun to watch in videos. His mannerisms really suggest that he genuinely loves doing this shit, even if it is corny by most standards."

"Overlooked albums of 2014?","What's the one album from this year that you implore the entire subreddit to listen to? The more obscure, the better (it still needs to be a good album though).  Links are encouraged!"
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","[Dark Forest - The awakening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hQsKSoA1bQ) - Pretty amazing album in my opinion, They somehow manage to fuse heavy/power metal with some folklorish and Celtic/Medieval elements and make it work really well. All songs are awesome and very well done and rich. The vocals fit perfectly and everything is just stellar. By far, one of the most overlooked albums of this year.

[Spellcaster - Spellcaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhWJXbNausg) - Very interesting album with an amazing variety of riffs going on, awesome drumming and vocals. Maybe it fits more in the speed/heavy metal genre but hey, i think it's a pretty powerful album.

[Noble Beast - Noble Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPRDE17-xIQ) - If i ever make a top 10 metal albums of 2014, this one will be in the top 3 guaranteed. Near perfect album and i don't think people fully acknowledge how hard it is to make an album of this caliber. A power metal album (imo, one of the most stale genres of metal) released in 2014, 60+ minute length, done by 20+ year old guys, DEBUT album, and it's pretty much perfect, musically and production wise. WTF! Now access your brain and try to remember the last time an album that checked all of these ticks. You can't! because there hasn't been a band that released an album so long and at the same time so good and consistent.

Anyway, this is my opnion on the matter. Noble Beast isn't as obscure as the other two, but it still slipped past by a lot of good people i know."
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","Jesus man, you really need to get out of my head.  As soon as I read the topic my first thought was Dark Forest.  A brilliant album(In my top 5 this year) and I haven't heard a single person mention it.  Then you go and mention Noble Beast, which happens to be my albums of the year. I'm tempted to say this is the best debut since Lost Horizon for me.  This album is insanely good. "
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","It might not be very obscure since it was covered in the weekly releases thread, but I was really fascinated with Divine Ascension's album *Liberator*. Just a really fresh sound with a female vocalist that didn't opt for the (arguably overused) soprano style. 

My favorite track on the album is [Stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7_frbp6bi8), without a doubt. [Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWqHmZFLQ3U) is another great track.

The rest of the album isn't stellar, but overall a very nice production. Worth checking out, in any case."
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","I cannot agree more with this

I came across them about 2 weeks ago, and i have been listening to the album ever since, its a fantastic prog/power album

My pick however, is Mago de Oz (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyrKYVo3GY0)
In my opinion, one of the best folk/power albums of the year"
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","I think this is extremely boring but the folklore is good, and boy do i love me some folky folklore"
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","I like the second one more. This could grow on me. "
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","&gt; It might not be very obscure since it was covered in the weekly releases thread

Everything gets covered there anyway. I haven't heard of this album though, and it definitely sounds pretty good from the two songs you linked. Now to see if it can be better than MindMaze's album, since their styles seem to be so similar."
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","I wasn't aware Divine Ascension released a second album, so this was a pleasant surprise for me! The tracks you linked are pretty solid, will have to check the album out."
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","[Neofly's Strangers in Paradise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmiMP8zwyKs)

Melodic power metal with a streak of symphonic in there. Great vocalist and uplifting songs.  "
"Overlooked albums of 2014?",":D"
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","I've posted these a lot, but these ones come to mind, cause they aren't exactly super popular bands, but their albums are pretty high quality:

"Overlooked albums of 2014?","Definitely top 5 for me."
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","Might as well include mine to get some more comments going here.

I absolutely insist everyone listen to Skyliner's debut album, *Outsiders*. One of the catchiest and most memorable songs from the album is ""[Forever Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9SOCeLI9vY)"", but it's a bit deceiving. You might think it's just a normal USPM album with some European influence, but the rest of the album has some incredible experimentation with black metal, death metal, and progressive metal thrown in. It's honestly the freshest thing I've heard from a power metal album in a long time. If you're looking for good starting points, though, the aforementioned song and ""[Symphony in Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVohphX3jug)"" should get you hooked."
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","Went in expecting ""Forever Young"" to be a cover, [like Pathfinder did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlLIfF8KUbI). Pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a cover at all."
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","I really like the Sonata album, but there were too many missteps. I guess it's still [Noble Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wh4rtJl5OY) for me, a late and very welcome entry. "
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","[Edge of Thorns- Insomnia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3yd1k17JGU)- Awesome guitar driven power metal

[Adamantra: Act II: Silent Narratives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e756WPVJoDQ)- Quality power/prog with heavy keyboard elements. 

"
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","I forgot about Adamantra, solid album with a great opening track. The very last part of the album always makes me need to listen to Lionheart again. "
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","Fun fact: The intro of ""Lionheart"" is the continuation of the previous album's ending track ""Ungiven""."
"Overlooked albums of 2014?","Not sure if it counts as overlooked but for me, it would be Project Arcadia's ""A time of changes"" , my favourite tracks off it being [Formidable foe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPwjXPTZG3o) and [I'm Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiNN5xPcMpE)"

"Overlooked albums of 2014?","Dawn Of Destiny - F.E.A.R [End This Nightmare] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMnb3GXeITU) 0:43 sort of ruins the album, but at least it's a chick saying it.

[Arion - Last Of Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVJpD_ntNBw)

"Dark Moor - In The Heart Of Stone [4:37] (Elisa Martin)","Dark Moor's earlier stuff with Elisa is their best, to me. She's got a voice unlike any other! Songs like [Beyond the Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eILXWl8RfxY), [The Night of the Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuF8R7UgEIs), [Maid of Orleans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5Ni-wrFwVs), and [Silver Lake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbol84KDqb8) are some of my favorites. "
"Dark Moor - In The Heart Of Stone [4:37] (Elisa Martin)","I agree, the early Dark Moor albums with Elisa are among my favorite albums, and for some reason i just cant get into Dark Moor once she left.  Her voice was so unique and refreshing for a female singer in power metal."

I am glad they're getting a lot of recognition now."
"Liege Lord - Suspicion - Master Control (1988)","It has to due with the 90s and how they fizzled out. I was listening to an interview by either Tony or Paul and how after their tour with CANDLEMASS in 1990 they just lost the drive. I don't really know why when they had these successful tours and albums, but apparently they stopped getting together for practices and each started their own thing or stopped playing music. It would have been interesting to see how they might have developed in the 90s with grunge going around."
"Liege Lord - Suspicion - Master Control (1988)","That's really interesting, I can imagine it gets difficult having to travel and tour all the time. Sometimes you just want to move on to something else.

"FIREWIND - Head Up High [3:47]","It's a good single song. This, along with ""World on Fire"" and ""Mercenary Man"" and ""Breaking the Silence"" were pretty much the first ever power metal songs I listened to that weren't recorded by Sonata Arctica. Sonata Arctica was my gateway to power metal, and Firewind were the second power metal band I ever listened to. It might be pretty straightforward and predictable, but it's well-done and catchy enough to get your attention."

Most of these I bought from Amazon, except for Skálmöld which is available in almost every store that sells CDs in my country, and Blind Guardian. I actually just bought those two today, after visiting a record store that has foreign metal albums. They only had the two, plus a couple of live albums which I don't care for. Had they more, I probably would have bought them as well. "
"So what have you bought this year?","Won't post my list since it's about 85 or so discs long right now, but out of power metal albums, the highlights are new HammerFall, Edguy, Dragonforce, Sonata Arctica, etc. Lots of great reissues this year (Picture is the first that comes to mind).

What ever happened to the German power metal band Rebellion? I really enjoy their music, but they lost a few members and Wikipedia and a few other sites were no help, so I turn to you guys.  
  
Help?"
"What happened to Rebellion?","""On December 30th 2010, Uwe Lulis, Simone Wenzel and Gerd Lücking all left the band"" - Metal Archives. I'm assuming this is what you're referring to. They released a new album (Arminius: Furor Teutonicus) in 2012, so it would seem they're still at it, just with new members.
"
"What happened to Rebellion?","Alright thanks, my fingers are crossed for a new album."
"For anyone who has already listened to ""Beyond the Red Mirror""","What’s the verdict on the bonus track “Distant Memories”? Is it worth buying the digipack version for, or is the album ultimately better paced without it? I really want to pre-order the album, but only the digipack version is available on Amazon for pre-order, and I don't want to buy a version of the album that has an average song in the middle of it which wrecks the pacing of greatness. Normally I wouldn't mind the addition of a bonus song like this, but its placing in the very middle of the album is concerning, whereas normally bonus songs seem to be added at the end. Its placing could potentially severely damage the experience, is what I'm getting at.

tl;dr version: Does the addition of ""Distant Memories"" damage the album experience? Is it a welcome addition, or not? "
"For anyone who has already listened to ""Beyond the Red Mirror""","As with almost every other song on the album, you need to listen to it a couple times and listen closely; it is actually quite fantastic, having one of the best chorus on the album and a number of other nice sections."
"For anyone who has already listened to ""Beyond the Red Mirror""","I really liked it, and it fits really well with the rest of the album. when I first listened I didn't even realize it was a bonus track. Plus if you end up disliking it you could always just skip it"
"For anyone who has already listened to ""Beyond the Red Mirror""","It definitely fits in with the rest of the album."
"For anyone who has already listened to ""Beyond the Red Mirror""","What everyone else said, it fits into the album really well, there's no drop in quality. The placing is probably because of this

"Rhapsody (of Fire?) - Village of Dwarves enhanced cool version","&gt;People post things, people say they don't like the those things or vice versa depending on their preferences. Thus is the flow of the internet.

But what's the point of posting it every day just so the same four people could say how much they dislike it. It's unnecessary and is lowering the quality of this subreddit. Just like that time a few months ago when we had three posts a day telling us how awesome Keldian was. It shouldn't be encouraged. "
"Rhapsody (of Fire?) - Village of Dwarves enhanced cool version","Because people want other people to understand why they dislike it. Freedom of speech. Reddit. Discussion.

Also I would spam this subreddit with stuff if I think people should notice. It should be encouraged because I want to hear good stuff. The more it appears here, the more likely I will be to hear it.

Also I didn't minus anything you said.

Also, quality of a subreddit is entirely subjective. I actually expect people to argue about opinions on bands here, that's like people arguing over band genres on wikipedia. But this is more joking around about Pellek and his somewhat awkward stuff on youtube.

The main reason is that he seems to sing like he does because it's 'cool' to sing really high. Not because it helps put across a theme of a song (which is why it fits in power metal). 

It reminds me of when I was younger I used to listen to songs just because they had shredding all over the place, and ignored ones that didn't. (Missed out on a lot of awesome Sonata Arctica songs early on due to this.)"

"Avantasia- The Watchmakers' Dream","The intro makes me so happy every time. I don't know why. 

I think this is the best song on the album. And Joe Lynn Turner. My god. That voice."
"Avantasia- The Watchmakers' Dream","Agreed!"
"Avantasia- The Watchmakers' Dream","I find this album -- Mystery of Time -- more so than any other album, creates a cohesive story when listened to from start to end. The first three songs particularly get me, from the somber _Spectres_, to the somewhat upbeat and -- striving? -- _Watchmaker's Dream_, to _Black Orchid_. Seems like that's when shit really hits the fan."

42. Within Temptation: Faster and Shot in the Dark
42. Unisonic: Unisonic (One of my least favorite song of theirs, but some people like it)

One tip is to check out the Japanese selection. Some songs are on there but not on the English ones. I wish I could have found Avantasia or a bunch of other bands; or even more of bands like Sonata Arctica"

With finals officially over, I had the chance to sit down and sort my thoughts and come up with the best and worst of this year. Personally, I think 2014 was a step up from 2013, but i'm not sure if its just because I listened to a lot more music this year or if it really was just overall better.

**10 WORST ALBUMS**

**10** Skull &amp; Bones- The Cursed Island- A  ripoff of Running Wild.  They aren't even trying to hide it. Long John Silver just rips off Port Royal's chorus after taking away all the energy. Also, good luck taking the singer seriously. 

**9** Iced Earth- Plagues of Babylon- Pointless riffs that do nothing with Stu Block wishing he was Matt Barlow is not for me.  I would avoid this album like the plague(get it?), especially Schaffer's ballad's.

**8**- Grailknights- Calling the Choir- I get it, they dress up like superheroes and cover Bonnie Tyler songs, so they are obviously aren't taking themselves seriously.  They doesn't save them from being bad. Teens who play Robot Unicorn attack will love this band. 

**7** 4th Dimension- Dispelling the Veil of Illusions- If you love overbearing keyboards your dick is going to be throbbing over this.  I don't remember much else about this album. Just keyboards, keyboards and more keyboards. 

**6** Lothlöryen- Some Ways Back Some More - What the hell does this album title even mean. 

**5** Betoken- Beyond Redemption - A lifeless collection of songs that just blend into one another.  Every member of the bands seems like they just can't be bothered. There are songs on that album that actually make me angry. 

**4** Twilight Force- Tales of Ancient Prophecies - Power metal's version of an exploitation film. If all you care about is french horns and choir vocals in the chorus, then this band is for you.  

**3** Delain- The Human Contradiction - Evanescence 2.0. Not power metal.  Barely even metal.  

**2** Holy Dragons- Dragon Inferno- There are actually some cool guitar parts here.  That isn't enough to save this album though.  

**1** Pellek- Cloud Dancers - All Pellek jokes aside, this album is a fucking atrocity.  I started listening to this album as a goof, and finished it out of morbid curiosity.  There isn't a single song on this album that would feel out of place on your local pop radio station.

__________________________________________________________

**TOP 10 POWER METAL ALBUMS**

**10** [Skyliner- Outsiders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4TMf1WNZ9U) - A bit long winded, but a solid debut album.  Aria of the Waters is one of my favorite songs this year. 

**9** [Edge of Thorns- Insomnia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3yd1k17JGU)- The guitar here is the star of the show here.  Constantly something going on, which seems to be more and more rare in power metal these days.

**8** [Disforia- The Age of Ether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zdj51D57nk)- Just insane power/prog metal that sounds like nothing i've heard before in the genre(So it will be ignored for the most part).  

**7** [Sonata Arctica- Pariah's Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSH1zwPf2Us)- Tony rising from the ashes like a god damn phoenix. As one of the biggest doubters of this album, I am so glad I was proven wrong.  

**6** [Xandria- Sacrificium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGTAmmTiD_Y)- With Nightwish continuing to push away from their old sound, i'm glad a band picked up the banner of symphonic driven power metal.  

**5** [Dark Forest- The Awakening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl_rlEgXD5E)- Super catchy, very fun album. There is nothing flashy or gimmicky, so it will be under a lot of people's radar, but make no mistake, this album is up there with the best of them. 

**4** [Freedom Call- Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu4TGlKrc1A)- Much like Sonata, it was good to see another one of the stalwarts returning to form.  After several pointless albums, Freedom Call blew me away with this album. 

3- [Viathyn- Cynosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMQ8MwAqfAs)- There is no excuse for this band to not be discussed about. They should be blowing up like crazy right now.  The replay-ability of this album is off the god damn charts. 

**2** [Triosphere- The heart of the Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqFtlAnhzu8)- The Queen of power metal and company return with a highly anticipated follow up to the Road Less Travelled and did not disappoint.  They are currently one of the best power metal bands around.  

**1**  [Noble Beast- s/t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1571Ucf3XA) - Everyone needs to take notice here, because Noble Beast just came out of nowhere to land a haymaker on this genre's jaw. This is what power metal should sound like. There are more riffs per song here than an entire Sabaton album.  
"
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I loved the hell out of that Twilight Force album.  I agree with your assessment of it, but the guy's outrageous soaring vocals sold it for me."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I disagree about Twilight Force a bit.  I mean, it's super cliche/camp to the point of parody, it has a bunch of stupid intro tracks with people impersonating Gandalf and stuff, plus it has Joakim add in some super generic background vocals I'm sure most people here will think are great.  But the guy has an amazing classic high pitched delivery.  It's not one of the best, but doesn't deserve to be one of the worst.

There's been a lot of good albums I enjoyed this year: Gloryful, Edgedown, A Sound Of Thunder, Bane of Winterstorm, Ring Of Fire, Elvenking.  I dunno if I've been paying close enough attention to everything coming out to know if they belong in a ranked list.

For non-PM I vote Blues Pills, so good.  Nuclear Blast found a keeper there.

Anyway I've been avoiding the subreddit for the last few weeks or so as it seems to have gone full retard, but I respect your opinions and appreciate you posting something worth reading/clicking."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","As much of an Iced Earth fan boy as I am, I have to agree it was quite the disappointment to hear. I gave this album many many chances and it still failed to meet up to any expectations I had. I even went back and listen to it just recently and it still doesn't meet up to anything that I hoped for, especially when Dystopia was just a such a phenomenal album. (I believe ot was my best of for 2011)

Otherwise you have a pretty solid list going here. Really can't argue with anything that's on the best of list."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I am really concerned because I just bought that Skull &amp; Bones album, but have to wait until Christmas to hear it. Also, Grailknights was just confirmed for Wacken and they look hilarious so I'm going to see them there. Your words don't inspire much confidence.

On the other hand, I feel the complete opposite about Twilight Force, Disforia and Viathyn than you do. Who knows. Either way it's cool to see your list.

Just curious about the following as this was a big year from power metal and these didn't make the list: Dragonforce, Edguy, HammerFall, Iron Savior, Persuader, and Mindmaze"
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","Add Falconer to the list! Black Moon Rising is easily my album of the year, and in my opinion among the best power metal albums ever released (probably top 15 or so)"
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I bought that album today (haven't had a chance to listen to it), and can't believe I forgot to mention it above."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","For Dragonforce, The Power Within was the only album from them that I truly enjoyed, So i was optimistic for this years album. Sadly, they reverted right back to their subpar songwriting. 

Edguy, One of my favorite bands, But this album isn't top 10 material for me.  

Hammerfall, That one preview song that released was awesome, but the rest of the album just fell flat for me.  I never consider hammerfall bad, but they just don't excite me. 

Iron Savior- I actually can't remember if I listened to the album or not. 

Persuader- Just missed top 10 for me. 

Mindmaze- Solid power metal, but I can't see putting it in my top 10."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I really don't understand how people can love Maximum Overload, it's just so random in quality and focus. "
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I'm curious as to your thoughts on Pythia's release. It's kind of short notice to be on a best of 2014 list but I think I like it more than Serpent's Curse."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I was a little let down by it. I need to give it more listens in hope that it'll grow on me"
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","What, no links for the worst albums? How are we to compare the greatness of the top 10 if there is no drek to compare to?"
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","Top ten worst list was a laugh to read. I feel pretty shitty only having listened to 8, 7, 4 and 1 of the top ten, now I need to at least get Viathyn and Triosphere cause Noble Beast's self titled album was off its head.
Also, fuck the start of NB's Master Of Depravity sounds similar to [The Meaning Of I - Voyager] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM5rZaUiiLs)"
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","You better listen to viathyn. It's right [here](https://soundcloud.com/viathyn/sets/cynosure) full streamable."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I'm glad to see Xandria on at least one list."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","Massive cheers from the Viathyn camp!!

I'm very stoked to have made your #3 spot for both Album and Song of the year. We're an unknown and unsigned band, so every little bit of buzz is appreciated, and every little bit of praise just warms my bones like sitting in front of a fire with a cozy blanket and a healthy measure of scotch.

Gotta start writing album 3 pretty soon here *grumble grumble..*"
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","Your thoughts on 2014's Timo Tolkki's Avalon album? I would've thought for sure it would be in your worst albums list, but even I forgot about it until now. "
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","Never finished listening to it actually.  I listened to a couple songs, seemed pretty bad.  I told myself i'd come back to it when I had time and kind of just forgot about it. "
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","Haha, I've got *Citadel* as my #1 of the album of the year. Looks like we were both fond of it.

Amazingly, I don't have any major issues with your list. Even the worst albums list is pretty fair in my opinion (except for Delain. How dare you?). I've only got three of the same albums as you in my top 20 list, though, but I can't deny that all of your picks are must-hear for 2014 (except for maybe Edge of Thorns...I never got the appeal). I'll post mine later once this thread loses steam. I'm looking forward to your opinions on my list XD"
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I assume those other 17 albums are all Japanese.  I'll be disappointed if they aren't. "
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I'm sorry to disappoint, then. I've only got 4 Japanese albums in my top 20 (I've got BABYMETAL in my non-power metal list, though). None of them are in my top 10 either, so I feel like I've let you down.

Don't worry; 2015 will be the year of JPM and only JPM."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","Solid list. I really like seeing SA on best-of lists this year, glad they're getting back in the game."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I agree with this list wholeheartedly."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","Oh man, Grailknights are hilarious. I never expected you to rate SA so high, imo it's a cool album but seriously nothing special.

Just out of curiosity, did you took a listen to Soen's album? Citadel is a totally fine choice too. In fact, i think there's a bunch of albums that would fit your ""TOP NON_POWER METAL ALBUM"" category. Good 2014 delivered some really memorable albums."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I actually passed over Soen because I read it has heavy tool vibes going on, and i'm not particularly a fan of Tool. I'll check it out though."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I'd say that's right, even more tool vibes were present in their previous album, imo in this one they manage to rise above tool's shadow. It's a very ""melancholic"" and mellow album so don't expect a true progressive metal punch."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","Now that I've given Noble Beast some time I can definitely climb aboard the hype train happily. Balls-out good power metal album. And what you said about the riffs is bang-on. "
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","What'd you think of Sabaton's new album and Blind Guardian's single? I actually totally agree with you on the Freedom Call album. I've always found them to be fairly mediocre but I was very pleasantly surprised to find out what a solid album it was. There were some great moments and tracks on there."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","We share two albums in the T10. Noble Beast and Skyliner."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","Have you heard Solitary Sabred? I just stumbled upon them recently. They are really good "
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","No mention of Sabaton? I feel their album was pretty solid or at least Night Witches deserving of a top 3 songs. Good choice of Freedom Call, maybe could have been higher on the list, such a great album. "
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I just don't think sabaton is that good.  Mediocre at best for me"
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I totally agree on Noble Beast. I just heard of them a few days ago in some underappreciated album thread and was totally blown away. Such an incredible album, and it's a huge shame I missed it when it dropped earlier this year."
"Mushmancat's Year in Review 2014","I'm having a real hard time getting past how buried in the mix the vocals get on a lot of the Noble Beast tracks, at least during the verses. 

I like it, but I want to like it more than I do?"

I don't fucking like him for what he become, in fact I hate that all this youtube success kinda made him into a terrible singer and bad music maker but it's not like he is singing poorly in this one and his early youtube videos were kind of good, i actually thought he could become a good gateway to metal for other people but i guess that goes down the drain with his latest efforts.

"[PelleK Tuesday] Have fun with this one - PelleK and some dude on the Nowegian X Factor TV show","Gateway to metal? Back in the day (we're talking 12 years old) I didn't even know PM was considered metal (Just thought it was rock). I just liked epic music and guitar. I think this is not uncommon. I think PM is a very good genre for getting people into metal due to the positivity and general lighter heaviness levels.

Generally people want positivity from their music (Positive music to reinforce positive moods, and positive music to escape negative moods). Power metal is one of the few modern metal genres that easily puts forward positive themes. "

For sexist lyrics, I can only imagine you're talking about songs like 'Aren't You a Little Pervert Too,' 'Two Out of Seven,' and 'Do Me Like a Caveman.' Except these are just 'dirty joke' songs which in no way comment on the superiority of one sex or the other, and the first two in fact do not comment on women at all and could very well concern gay men.

For religious lyrics.... uh.... Do you also think Powerwolf is Christian metal? Because neither Powerwolf nor Edguy, which has much less lyrics in anyway about religion, is Christian metal. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3TsVaFR870) is what Christian metal sounds like."

"The 3-CD edition of the new Nightwish album--what is an ""earbook""?","An Earbook is basically an oversized Digipak - it's a much larger, hardbound package for the CDs and booklet (which is really more of a book now). Sometimes size is all that's offered - other times there will be more booklet content such as artwork, writing, etc. Earbooks also often come with more CDs than what a jewelcase or Digipak offer.

They're basically 'Collector's items.' They're for the people who want something more than just standard CD packaging to commemorate the album while also getting some potential bonus content. They cost a great deal more than a typical album or Digipak because they're for the people willing to shell out that much for whatever bonuses are offered. "

"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","Alright then. I am indifferent towards guitar solos. They don't really matter to me. I mean, sure, they're nice to listen to and I can enjoy them, but ultimately they aren't going to make a song better or worse for me, and I quickly forget about it until I hear it again. I just don't remember them, never really do. I've listened to ""Mirror Mirror"" over 100 times, and I couldn't tell you how the guitar solo goes. I didn't nominate nor vote in the 'Best Guitar Solo' category in the 2014 PM Awards, because I couldn't remember any. 

I've seen many times when people talk about metal songs, that they're complementing a solo, saying that kicked ass, it made a mediocre song worthwhile or that it sucked, etc., while I'm just like, ""Hmm...."". I can never agree or disagree. "
"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","I can see where you're coming from. A lot of the times my opinion is that a solo was just thrown in the song for the sake of a solo.  But there are times, certain bands, that actually know how to write a solo.  Lost Horizon solos each feel like they are sculpted specifically for that song.  Randy Rhoads solos feel that way too.  "
"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","Solos are just like the well known verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus. Bands do them because it's almost a staple in power metal."
"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","I think that unless a solo is warranted, it shouldn't just be  thrown in. However, I appreciate when a guitarist gets to show his chops at least once in an album.

Although, you can always show them through awesome riffs as well. Michael Romeo from Symphony X does that nonstop. This is why I really appreciate songs that have legitimately interesting musical structures rather than power chord grinding. I'm looking at you, gloryhammer."
"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","I originally listened to power metal for the solos. It depends if you actually play the instrument or not, because I didn't even like metal before I started playing guitar. (to be honest, I didn't even know what was and wasn't metal, when my guitar teacher was like 'oh, so you like metal, do you?' I was like wtf this is considered metal? back when I was 12)

I can say that when you can visualize what the guitarist is playing it makes solos more interesting to listen to. ""oh, that technique is pretty crazy"" etc."
"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","That could be part of the reason. I don't play any instruments and never have. And my instrument knowledge is quite poor as well. "
"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","I am your polar opposite. I came to metal for the solos. Power metal exemplifies it. I recall solos more than lyrics. Admittedly though some solos can be forgettable while others can be the highlight.  "

"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","This is exactly how I am. Thrash is my favourite style of music and the first style of metal I really latched on to. There's a great interview in Get Thrashed where one musician (can't remember who) mentions that they wanted to play punk, but be like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest and show that they were really great musicians. That sounds really appeals to me as well, and I think power metal exemplifies that too (not the punk part, more that power metal bands want you to know how good they are)."

**Non PM**

I was actually going to revive this idea Tomorrow. In fact, I meant to do this last Saturday, but we had way too much (2014 awards, New Releases), so it would have been lost in the shuffle. (Hell, I even got /u/Marodox1 blessing on this as well!) But whatever, it's here. (little miffed, but what's done is done)

**PM Issue**

Is everyone really caring about the production issues of Beyond the Red Mirror? Clearly, no one has heard Dark Moor's Shadowland album. That's the epitome of bad.

Speaking of Blind Guardian; Worst album IMO; Night At the Opera. Why you say? It's a fucking chore to get through. There are many amazing songs on there (Precious Jerusalem, Battlefield, and Punishment Divine is one of my all time favourites) but to go from start to finish is a nightmare. I need a nap after listening to this thick as mud album. At least Battlions of Fear was short."

"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","What do people see in Pathfinder!!?!??! I don't get it, am I too fucking stupid? Is the album too superior for me??? WTF! Why does it get so much praise??

Everybody says Blind Guardian's album has production issues, very minimal ones but it does have. WHAT ABOUT PATHFINDER'S FUCKING FIRST ALBUM??? It's a fucking abomination production-wise!! It's easily the worst production in an album. They may be a Polish band but this album is anything but polish-ed (sorry). Some say Hansi vocal style is hard to get into which I fully disagree (he has the voice of a power metal god). PATHFINDER'S VOCALIST ON THE OTHER FUCKING HAND DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SING AND IS CONSTANTLY HITTING NOTES SO FUCKING HIGH THAT HIS MIDDLE NAME CAN ONLY BE TINNITUS. How would you feel ^waaaaaa if I would started shouting ^waaaaaaaa in every fucking random phrase ^waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa of every post??

The lyrics are also a problem (obviously). I have no fucking clue what they are talking about despite several efforts from my part.

&gt;We are beyond the space, beyond the time we are flying away,

&gt;Where the dreams still meet a reality.

&gt;We are beyond the light, beyond the dark,

&gt;Where the space-time continuum and the wonder of life has its end.

What is this? So many part of the lyrics are so abstract that they could be about anything and at the same time, they are about nothing. I always had a hard time with lyrics but I do make the effort to understand them but this album... This fucking album. If I was in a life threatening situation and my means of survival were to understand either these album lyrics or quantum physics, I would easily choose quantum physics, I would die either way but at least I could have learned something.

Lastly, my biggest gripe with these guys. There's no songwriting to be found here! They do not write songs, they have bouts of spastic seizures, play whatever their hyperactive mind can come up with and then mesh everything together in what they call ""songs"" (I call it abominations) in the most non-cohesive manner. The songs start in a style and end in a completely different one suffering several transformations in between, it's like they have fucking Alzheimer's (sorry to everyone who endures the disease directly or indirectly on a daily basis) and they keep forgetting what song they are playing.

I feel sorry for Dragonforce who often get compared to this horrible contraption, Dragonforce may have written and rewritten the same song over and over again and sold them with a different name but at least it's well written, well produced and well defined (structure wise).

Can someone elucidate me or give a brother a helping hand because I could delve into all the problems that Pathfinder has and I would only be over when my beard hit my fucking knees.

"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","I agree with this. Pathfinder sucks."
"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","Pathfinder is my fav PM band, and BTSBTT is my fav song and album. Pathfinder is completely ""over-the-top"" in every department including vocals, guitar shredding, orchestra, form, etc. (I won't comment on production since I'm clueless on that aspect). You have to understand that some people like me really love the ""over-the-top"" feel, and Pathfinder IMO capture it the best. The vocals do go into these random falsetto highs, but I love it. The falsetto in BTSBTT was the highest pitch note I've ever heard from a PM male singer, and it blew my mind; that's why I loved it. The guitar shredding could be considered distasteful, but trust me, as a guitar shredder myself, I go on these binge listens looking for Ynqwie clones and sometimes all I want in a song is light-speed arpeggios and alternate picking; crazy guitar shredding is like a drug to me, I'm completely serious. I know people compare Pathfinder to DragonForce, but when talking to a mainstream audience of people not used the style, there are few other bands they might know of with ""over-the-top relentless guitar shredding"" backed up with orchestration. As for the lyrics, and trust me, I've studied massive amounts of poetry in college: it's not ""great,"" but the ""over-reacher"" theme that is found in some PM is delineated to extremes. The lyrics are abstract and metaphysical, but they're essentially showing how people should be ultar-positive, self-actualize, and transcend into the greatest state they can be in; it's humanistic, existentialist, melioristic, etc. The philosophy is there if you're open to interpreting it with close reading. These philosophical themes are not just embedded in the lyrics but in the transcendental nature of the songs: fast, positive, yearning, and ""high"" or ascending. The subject of ""good songwriting"" is subjective; I love long pieces, and if the song is 95% guitar shredding and falsettos: all the better for me. I hope my paradigm opens up your mind about why people like me love Pathfinder. All the best! "

"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","Dragonforce's vocals are actually pretty nuts. While ZP sounds like he sings higher, Marc Hudson actually does. 

Outside of that, they may not sing as high as other bands, but they still sing at the top of the tenor range. What gives it another dimension of difficulty is that it's being done at a lot of 180 BPM songs. You are having to focus on what makes you sound good at a high range while enunciating really fast"
"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","I didn't mean to say Dragonforce has had bad vocalists (ZP is probably in my top 5 power metal singers). I meant more that Pathfinder's vocals are ridiculous because their singer displays his entire range seemingly almost on command, and there isn't as much sense to what he's doing as there is to what a band like Dragonforce does. In that respect, I think Pathfinder's vocals are more over the top just because they're kinda crazy. I enjoy ZP and Hudson way more (in fact, I'm a huge Dragonforce fan!)."
"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","&gt; I didn't mean to say Dragonforce has had bad vocalists

A lot of people underestimate Dragonforce vocals. I started on the path to learning how to sing power metal and did Dragonforce initially for kicks, and I quickly found out that they are a tricky band to do.

"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","I wholeheartedly agree. Kiske is an amazing singer, but Deris meshes much, much better with the band, and they fit as this more aggressive, yet melodic power metal that focuses on both vocals and instrumentation equally. I really like where Helloween is right now and where Kiske is right now."
"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","I honestly like both so much it's hard to decide. The problem with Kiske-era is that it really gets by solely on two albums. But those two albums are so good and so important to power metal, that I can't not put Kiske ahead of Deris.

On the other hand, you have to respect the band for going out and finding a singer who sounds nothing like Kiske, and building an identity around him. Perhaps even more amazingly, the band has been better in their second decade with him than they were in their first.

Also, as much as I love Deris, he can't do the Kiske songs justice live. I actually enjoyed the Deris-era songs much more when I saw them. "
"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","I'll get us started. I have a few grievances i'd like to vent about.  

Sabaton fans have surpassed Dragonforce fans as the most obnoxious fanbase in power metal.  Everything Sabaton does is the greatest thing ever according to them. If there was ever a band undeserving of their popularity its Sabaton.  Now, I will say, I actually really enjoyed The Art of War and to a lesser extent, Carolus Rex, but for the most part they are way, way below par. And what they write can barely be called metal.  At least with Dragonforce, they wrote stuff that sounded like metal.(Albeit, a very poor attempt) Sabaton is bombastic pop music. 

Inb4 800 responses telling me that Sabaton don't take themselves seriously. 


If you don't like harsh vocals in any capacity, you shouldn't consider yourself a metalhead.  I don't know if its me, and I never go around telling everyone i'm a metalhead, but on the inside I identify as what one would call a metalhead.  If you don't like harsh vocals you are just a giant vagina. 

I don't know if i'm mentioned this before or now, but Japanese metal is a scourge.

Also, why are albums and bands from other sub-genres included in the power metal weekly release threads? It says so in the name that it's POWER metal, not FOLK metal or DEATH metal. I understand it if they are fusions, but 90% of the time, they're not. Is it just me who doesn't understand this?

Also, I don't get the fascination with prog? Don't get me wrong, I like it, but most metalheads just absolutely goes crazy over it. Most of the power/prog bands are just really bland and boring."
"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","The weekly release threads are for power metal albums and releases that might appeal to power metal fanbase. Melodic Death metal and power metal are very similar, hence why you see melodeath albums occasionally. "
"The Return of No Fucks Saturday. Now on a new date and time.","Agreed on your last point. I really struggle with prog bands. There are only a couple I really like: Queensryche and Savatage.

When bands do power/prog, it rarely works. Straight forward power metal is much better. This is one reason why I'm not sure if I'll ever go to ProgPower. Half of the lineup is usually really killer, and half of it is boring. "

"Do you guys want a free mindfuck?","[M Shadows, the singer of Avenged Sevenfold, put *Ecliptica: Revisited* as his #2 album of 2014.](https://www.facebook.com/AvengedSevenfold/posts/10152499405010583?fref=nf)

Here's everything wrong with this:

1. WHAT

2. Lana Del Rey beat Sonata Arctica? A metal frontman chose Lana Del Rey over Sonata?

3. *Ecliptica: Revisited* actually made his top 5 list of the year? Did he not listen to *Pariah's Child*? Did he not listen to any other albums this year?

4. Why the hell was M Shadows listening to Sonata Arctica?

5. Why is Taylor Swift on that list?

6. WHY DOES LANA DEL REY APPEAR ON THREE OF THEIR LISTS?

And that's my yearly mushmancat-like post."
"Do you guys want a free mindfuck?","Lana Del Rey is more metal than A7X."
"Do you guys want a free mindfuck?","[M Shadows?](http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/05/Who-the-fuck-is-this-gif.gif)"
"Do you guys want a free mindfuck?","I was the guy bitching about it when sonata arctica reposted the picture...basically saying ""how can pariah's child not be on there while revisited is, did he only listen to those 5 albums?"""
"Do you guys want a free mindfuck?","Pretty fucked up lists, wasn't counting on lana del rey, let alone zacky picking taylor swift... the rev died and took their mojo, hope someday they can make great music again"
"Do you guys want a free mindfuck?","I think that M Shadows really *really* wants to be metal, like Pantera or Metallica, but is just to something-core or what ever to be there, so he's pulling out these band names to show just how metal he is."
"Do you guys want a free mindfuck?","In all fairness, A7X have been pretty core-free ever since their self-titled album came out. Their most recent album felt **a lot** like a tribute to '80s metal bands. They're just incredibly bland in my opinion nowadays. "
"Do you guys want a free mindfuck?","I haven't listened to them since they started writing for Call of Duty--I once went back to listen to them and was amazed at how I used to think they were the best band in the world.   Not awful, but like you said--bland."
"Do you guys want a free mindfuck?","Ahh, A7x, my favorite band since 2nd grade turned sour to me with their newest album. I loved their music aside from the really emo faze that they had, but now they've sold out almost as badly as their favorite band, Metallica. Avenged Sevenfold had its own sound for so long, but they kept trying to achieve what was best to be called the new Metallica.

They always fall short of Metallica, because they forgot that Metallica was famous for being something new and influential. Now they sold out with their own Load Album, Hail to the King, and their own Reload album, Waking the Fallen Ressurected.

How many Veteran fans have to be lost before they give up? They are the musical form of Runescape 3."
"Do you guys want a free mindfuck?","Why even bother with his/their opinion, there's no explanation for the choices, they all seem completely random as if they put a bunch of album names in a sac and chose them randomly.  Also have you even heard Lana Del Rey's album? It's awful, it's comparable to that spacey funeral doom metal in atmosphere except it sucks. Like 99.9% of all pop."

"Seventh Wonder - The Black Parade","I love Seventh Wonder but aren't they prog metal?"
"Seventh Wonder - The Black Parade","They are, but they did originally start out as a power metal band, and some consider them to be power-prog (similar to Symphony X)."
"Seventh Wonder - The Black Parade","Who said they can't be both? You can have a powerful sound and catchy choruses AND progressive song structure and crazy time signature. As stated by /u/Edledhron, There is Symphony X, but also Angra, Labÿrinth, Theocracy, Serenity, Anubis Gate, Pagan's Mind, Elegy, Evergrey, Beyond Twilight and SO many more bands that cross the boundaries of both genres."
"Seventh Wonder - The Black Parade","A band certainly can be both, whether or not SW is among such bands is what's up for debate. My own opinion is that they are not, unless you'd also count bands like Dream Theater, Haken, and Pain of Salvation as power-prog."
"Seventh Wonder - The Black Parade","For me, it's all about those catchy choruses on Mercy Falls."

"Dragonforce - Heart of a Dragon","I think it is funny... You say 2007? You were a few albums behind. Heart of a Dragon was on Valley of the Damned, a 1999 release. 2006 saw Inhuman Rampage, and the notorious Inhuman Rampage tour.

And during that time, everyone and their mother was shitting on DragonForce, because of some bad sound engineering preventing them from being able to hear themselves during shows. It gave the illusion that they were a studio band, and their reputation as drunkards didn't help.

After Ultra Beatdown, they picked themselves up, kicked ZP out of the band, and picked up Marc Hudson. Much better now. Very few issues at shows.

"A good wizard knows when to apologise","I just have a small suggestion. When the release thread gets posted on Saturday, don't sticky it until Sunday or Monday. The timeframes they cover go from Monday to Sunday, so there might still be releases coming out from the previous week's thread. Furthermore, I feel like no one looks at the release thread once it's stickied. That might sound weird, but look at this week's thread and its score of 3, and compare it back to when I or MMC would do the threads and they'd be unstickied on the frontpage for about 24 hours before they got stickied. 

Thoughts?"
"A good wizard knows when to apologise","Yeah I've been playing around with the timings on that one.

That said - totally aside from the silly week - it springs to mind that there was a highly commented upon thread with a number of users voicing support for a 2nd mod but you're still - even in this very thread - reluctant to consider that. Similarly a guidelines thread was gaining attention as well as detailed suggestions too...will they be disregarded additionally?

"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","His last comment was 12 days. He still hasn't posted the 2014 Awards nominees. He won't reply to my messages (albeit I sent it 24 hours ago).

I know this sub doesn't demand a whole lot of active moderation, but that doesn't mean he should be absent 250 days of the year. So my question is does anyone know /u/SpeakMouthWords personally and know what he's up to? Furthermore, I think it's about time we get a second mod. We're at the point where the oldest post on the frontpage is roughly 24 hours old, and with the upcoming Blind Guardian AMA, I think we'll need the manpower to make sure this subreddit stays well-oiled.

Just to make it clear, I'm absolutely not advocating we overthrow him or get a replacement. I think we need a second mod. And not me either; I've already overstayed my welcome by waiting for this 2014 Awards thing. But I can't be the only one a little frustrated that the one fallback that a subreddit needs is one that we don't have."
"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","I've been a proponent for a second mod as well. It just makes a difference if the presence of a mod is actually noticeable.

I religiously check the sub for the 2014 awards post every day... hope it will turn up soon.

&gt; I've already overstayed my welcome

The hell. I don't know what's gone on in the past, but you're probably the biggest contributor to this sub. I'd be fine with you as a mod, and I can't think of anyone else that fits the bill."
"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","I am definitely for a second mod, but when I brought this up our current mod shot this down for what I believed to be fairly weak reasons.  That said, maybe if enough people think there should be one, there will be one."
"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","I agree. When a moderator postulates that a community doesn't need moderation, that just comes off as a device to justify his own (lack of) actions. Moderation is *not* obsolete. Earlier, the issue of trolling was raised and subsequently brushed off because we, as a community, will regulate ourselves with downvotes. I don't see trolling as a very huge issue, but it would not take much effort to moderate this either. So trolling is basically condoned.

The weekly release threads need stickying, and all the efforts that people put into writing elaborate band/album reviews, top 10 lists and so on, are basically lost as soon as they're off the front page. These are things I'd like to see changed."
"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","&gt; That said, maybe if enough people think there should be one, there will be one.

I hope that's the case... I definitely think that at least one more mod is needed, maybe even two. Even though we are a small sub that is mostly self-regulating, there are a lot of things that mods can do that aren't necessarily policing content--posting discussions, hosting AMAs, running contests and polls, etc. Plus, on the rare occasion that dealing with trolls or disputes does become a need, having more than one person available makes it easier to respond in a timely fashion, and also (may) help avoid power tripping.

I mod a small subreddit myself, and at least for us, it's definitely more about helping create content and interacting with users than it is about checking content. "
"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","I honestly think that a *few* mods is better than just one or two. Take a look at places like /r/Mead, they have 3000 more people than us and they have 6 mods. Or /r/cheesemaking - 2500 people TOTAL, *seven* mods.

And we shouldn't have just two mods, because otherwise we can have drama hit where one takes over on a power trip, or completely demolishes discussion because they do not agree with it. At least, with more mods, corruption of the system is less likely to occur without overwhelming support from 50%+ of the mods.

If you aren't in the running for one of the mods though, something is wrong, you are constantly doing so much more for this sub than anyone else can claim to. You should be *one of* the new moderators."

"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","Do you have Milk and Lemons/Vinegar? Then you have what you need to get half of those things! Just heat about 4L of milk up until it starts to get frothy, turn off the heat and chuck in a cup or so of Vinegar or Lemon juice, and leave it go for 20-30 minutes. Pour the curds you get through a bit of double thick Muslin on a Strainer, and chuck a quarter to half tsp of salt in there and stir it in. Whack this lot in a container, lid it, and dump it in the fridge to cool down. With 4L Milk, you should be looking at about 1Kg of fucking rad Cream Cheese. It lasts a week or so.

For the Mead... That takes like 6 months so just pick some up at the bottleo or some shit.

"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","It's not like anyone attacks /u/SpeakMouthWords for having a life, but the point raised is that someone that doesn't have the time to act as a mod should not be the sole mod of a community.

Just sayin'"
"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","I understand what you're saying. My biggest gripe here is that he'll come back, most likely say everything is alright and life will go on.

"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","Word of caution

I know they are the most well-liked subreddit, but /r/atheism had this same idea... Mod #1 isn't very active, and isn't all-knowledgeable of how to run a sub, so having a Mod #2 is nice, right? Then the mod overturns and takes over a sub, kicking out Mod #1 on a TECHNICALITY.

I agree on the second mod side. I urge keeping it extremely selective, with high standards."
"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","Mod #1 was an empty chair. He purposefully let people on his subreddit do whatever they want, believing upvotes/downvotes would take care of things. The problem with that is that reddit's system is designed so that those who want quickly consumed, shallow content that has mass appeal can easily overwhelm those looking for more content. The result was that /r/atheism was a flood of memes and circlejerking that made /r/adviceanimals and /r/circlejerk look like amateurs.  Laizzes-faire moderation works in a small community where content quality can remain high simply by virtue of what is submitted and upvoted, and incidents of extreme negativity are rare, but it breaks down relatively quickly. Through moderation, /r/atheism was able to relatively improve given that it was still comprised of atheists more concerned about complaining about religion than being a serious platform to discuss the matter. Of course, this led to an even greater flood of people complaining about 'censorship' and their memes being taken away."
"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","I was there when it happened. That is not what happened.

Jij took charge, said he wasn't going to do anything crazy, then immediately banned all non-self posts, and flooded the modlist with subreddit collector mods from /r/MagicSkyFairy, the subreddit dedicated to trolling /r/atheism. He then banned every user who dissented against him and got upvoted for it, for weeks, sent brigades to downvote the guys who were getting upvoted, before he banned them, and the drama got /r/atheism removed from the default subs.

Even if the sub was mostly image macros (not memes) and jokes? At least it looked like the rest of the front page subs, so it wasn't out of place. It was subtly approachable, and the comments were actually a reasonable place.

And before the Jijover, it was only HALF macros and jokes. There was actually a lot of good content, in the form of philosophical essays, freethinker blogposts, and documentaries were posted ALL THE TIME. I saw at least 20 good, not macro, not joke posts, a week. (Not to mention all the not macro, not joke posts that I didn't care for.) I was satisfied, and my feedback during the Jijover was ignored.

The original mod came forward immediately after he was removed, and he was ultimately ignored as well. It was unethical, handled poorly, and detrimental to the sub as a whole."
"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","I was there as well.

&gt; then immediately banned all non-self posts

What was banned was direct links to images, which was an effort to reduce the amount of weight that memes had on the sub. They could still have a large presence on the site if that was what the community really wanted, but one could not karmawhore off of them and a little effort had to be made in reading them.

If you're looking for additional content, that's on the users of the sub, and just because you set someone up in a position of authority doesn't me that the content they're not required to create is going to be great or even positive.

I like our hands-off mod, because I see no reason or need for him to be more active. Why, exactly, do we need two people doing this?"
"I know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod","I thought I already made this clear. The new mod could finally get the 2014 Awards back up and running again, they could make it so that my Weekly Releases posts don't automatically get sent to the trash when I submit them, they could sticky those weekly releases (which hasn't been done for the past 3 weeks), and they could answer the modmail.

We don't have many 'official' type posts, but those that we do currently aren't receiving as much attention as they could with multiple mods. And with more mods, who knows?

This song is textbook BG but it's amazing nonetheless."
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","Much in the same way that I find Lost Horizon and Pathfinder average, despite them getting lorded around as the best bands ever.

I could always see the appeal of BG, but everything I've heard earlier was, by far, not living up to the hype. And you know me, vocal style is crucial. I'm still not a huge fan, but this track is so damn impressing musically.

Would you hit me up with some other BG tracks like this?"
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","This is the first time BG are impressing you musically?  What BG songs have you heard"
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","I don't remember any of the song titles, I'm afraid"
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","Ok, we'll start your journey at the album where Blind Guardian became Blind Guardian, Somewhere Far Beyond. 

[Time What Is Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0fV5KF80_Q) is the same style as the new song, Face-destroying opening riff and a absolutely classic chorus. 

Next we have Imaginations from the Otherside, which to no surprise seems like it will be the closest thing to the new album stylistically.  You really can't go wrong with any of the songs on this album, but if you want something that grabs you right away, give

 [the Script for My Requiem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZznRuOKQqQ) a listen. 

Following that is their Magnum Opus, Nightfall in Middle Earth, again, near perfect album, like the last two.  Any song is fucking brilliant, but I'm going to suggest starting with 

[Time Stands Still (At the Iron Hill)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRdBwXslqbA). At this point you want a good sound system or headphones, a lot of shit going on, so you want to get the full experience. If your speakers aren't picking up this floor tom hits during the chorus you are missing out. 

We'll have you skip the next two albums for now and go right to [A Voice in the Dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE40BA7Oxb0) from At the Edge of Time.

Ok, so if those songs I linked pique your interest give the full albums a listen.  From there move on to the 5 albums I didn't list at your own leisure The first three are still solid albums, but they don't capture the aura of BG.  A Twist in the Myth and A Night at the Opera(Except for And then there was silence) are merely mediocre albums at best and I would save those for last. "
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","I love your write-up, but then you had to go and kill my boner with your trashing ANatO at the end! How can we agree on everything else, yet come to such differing conclusions about the same album?!?"
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","To offer an opposing view, I think the albums /u/mushmancat deems to be mediocre are fantastic as well.

The only issue with A Twist in the Myth for me is its awful production, which sterilizes everything and makes Hansi sound almost like a robot at times. I hope it gets a much needed remix/remaster sometime soon...

A Night at the Opera is only slightly less perfect than Nightfall in Middle-earth, but still perfect."
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","Hey! You seem to know a few things about the names of instruments! I have a question regarding Time Stands Still (At the Iron Hill), during the chorus ""...the fate of us all,"" there is this very faint sound, almost sound like a string instrument of some kind, could that possibly be some sort of harp, or am I way off in that assumption?

Edit: It can be heard the best in the last chorus."
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","well, my knowledge about instruments is pretty basic.  If I had to venture a guess I would say either a harp or a lute though."
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","Not more basic than mine! That's for sure :)

Thanks for your input!"
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","Thanks for the walkthrough, mate. Really warming up to BG now!

BG have 3 albums that i don't like and one that i thought was really bad, i'm still a huge fan of BG and will continue to be regardless of the quality of their latest output. I'm a huge Sabaton fan but i really only loved ""Carolus Rex"", everything else is in my opinion a bunch of bad songs with some really fun songs."

Jesus, when I think about if I had never found Blind Guardian...  Nightmare."
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","Okay, so I am completely clueless when it comes to music so I can't speak in those terms, but why does this seem so damn muffled?

The melody is okay, but it just doesn't sound that crisp to me. It is like listening to a low bitrate track you downloaded from kazaa, back in the year 2001 or something."
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","This is an unofficial source - it's probably a low quality rip or something. The teasers they released sounded much better, and having something better than youtube streaming will be the real test of how good the production sounds."
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","Yeah, now when you mention it. The single isn't supposed to be released until the 5th/6th, right?"
"Blind Guardian - Twilight Of The Gods","Correct, it's official release is tomorrow, though it won't be available in the US until the 9th."

"Swärdh - Riding the Unicorn",""
"Swärdh - Riding the Unicorn","Damn, this is awesome! To me, it sounds a bit like Blind Guardian and Keeper-Era Helloween mixed together. :D

Also, I think the band name is pronounced like ""sword"" (They're Swedish, so the a with the umlauts makes an ""oh"" sound. I had assumed they were German at first and I'm like, ""wtf, swehrd? what a silly name"")"
"Swärdh - Riding the Unicorn","Almost!

Your first assumption is more correct, I think you've mixed Å and Ä with each other.

I am curious though. The swedish word for sword is svärd. I am wonder if this is some old form of spelling, I do know that Swärdh is a surname, but that is all."
"Swärdh - Riding the Unicorn","Ah, sorry about that. You're right, I was confusing those characters indeed. "
"Swärdh - Riding the Unicorn","A really good song. Is this from an upcoming release? They only have a demo listed on metal archives and this song's not on it."

"Demons &amp; Wizards - Blood On My Hands","Just a friendly PSA, Demons &amp; Wizards finally have their 2 albums available for free streaming on Spotify!"
"Demons &amp; Wizards - Blood On My Hands","You just made my *week*."
"Demons &amp; Wizards - Blood On My Hands","You got me so hyped about a 3rd album.Then my dreams were crushed"
"Demons &amp; Wizards - Blood On My Hands","Huh? I've had songs from both albums on my playlists since last summer when I started using Spotify. Different catalogues for different reasons I guess..

The most important part is that they are now available!"

"Demons &amp; Wizards - Blood On My Hands","Iced Earth if you like the guitar. "
"Demons &amp; Wizards - Blood On My Hands","Iced Earth was obvious the guitarist is the same."
"Demons &amp; Wizards - Blood On My Hands","Persuader and Savage Circus. Different guy, but similar."
"Demons &amp; Wizards - Blood On My Hands","Looks like you already know Kamelot.  Check out Symphony X if you want some heavier progressive-style PM.  Avantasia is a metal opera band, made up of a bunch of different musicians from various metal and power metal groups.  Check out the song ""The Scarecrow,"" by them. I've been digging that one lately.  Evergrey isn't exactly a power metal band, but has a similar sound you might enjoy."
"Demons &amp; Wizards - Blood On My Hands","Already know all of them.Thanks anyway"
"Demons &amp; Wizards - Blood On My Hands","Sonata Arctica, Dragonforce, Kamelot, Helloween, Rhapsody, Rage, Majestic..."

"Magic Kingdom - Symphony of War","God I love this album.  Just a scant few months until Savage Requiem comes out - no Olaf Hayer, but their new guy sounds pretty good as well.  Cautiously optimistic."
"Magic Kingdom - Symphony of War","Olaf's voice is magical, i honestly don't know if their new guy can handle it. "
"Magic Kingdom - Symphony of War","I thought the same thing about Luca Turilli's newest album, but Conti stepped up and proved me wrong, so I'm hoping this guy does too."
"Magic Kingdom - Symphony of War","Same here. I'm excited for their new album, but I want to hear Olaf again. Apparently, he's doing vocals for the band symphonity and will be in their upcoming album."

"Alestorm- Nancy the Tavern Wench","Piratefest 2015?"
"Alestorm- Nancy the Tavern Wench","Indeed"
"Alestorm- Nancy the Tavern Wench","Make sure you bring an extra $20 for one of the cool piratefest shirts. I missed out cause I didn't bring cash with me because I lost my wallet last time I was in the pit."
"Alestorm- Nancy the Tavern Wench","I didn't get the Piratefest shirt unfortunately (it looked like they only had it in womens, although I could've just asked if they had any), but I did get the ""Drink"" shirt, and some other goodies. Oh, I also caught one of the setlist papers and got it signed by the band."

"SABATON - Ghost Division (OFFICIAL LIVE VIDEO)","Well, you will be happy to hear that, i posted this as a tribute to the fact that i, only a couple hours ago, bought tickets to their show in London :D

I am so hyped already :D (Delain and Battle Beast are a huge bonus, as they are both awesome too)"
"SABATON - Ghost Division (OFFICIAL LIVE VIDEO)","Yes. Battle Beast is great. 

You'll love Sabaton. They're so much fun. You can tell they're having a blast on stage. The show is great. I was sad I missed them last time they came through with Amon Amarth and Skeletonwitch."
"SABATON - Ghost Division (OFFICIAL LIVE VIDEO)","I saw the same tour, I'm sure, but in LA. I took my GF with me, and she's more of a Metal sympathizer than a fan, and even she enjoyed Sabaton, and their performance.

I was just getting into Sabaton at then time, and that show definitely earned them a huge fan. They're just great."
"SABATON - Ghost Division (OFFICIAL LIVE VIDEO)","Yeah. You can just tell they enjoy what they do very much. They're not on stage for the paycheck but because they love the music and performing."
"SABATON - Ghost Division (OFFICIAL LIVE VIDEO)","I saw these guys last month with Skeletonwitch and Amon Amarth. Easily the best live band there, and that's saying something with that line-up. "

"Mighty Warriors from New Zealand and/or Australia, where do you buy your CD's from?","Looking through fishpond now. Everything has to be shipped from overseas, which is kinda expected, but it has a decent range and fair prices. Pretty much everything Blind Guardian is unavailable though :( Thanks for the recommendation."
"Mighty Warriors from New Zealand and/or Australia, where do you buy your CD's from?","I'll second fishpond. Only bought from them twice but they're worth it.

Digging through mightyape might also be worth a try for you but they're pretty clueless around music."

"Alestorm- Sunset on the golden age",""
"Alestorm- Sunset on the golden age","Aw yiss, Alestorm!

**EDIT:** Not as good as [Captain Morgan's Revenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN9bcHoThNU), IMO."
"Alestorm- Sunset on the golden age","Are we talking song vs song, or album vs album?  Because Sunset on the Golden Age, as an album, is definitely better than Captain Morgan's Revenge, overall."
"Alestorm- Sunset on the golden age","Song vs song, definitely."
"Alestorm- Sunset on the golden age","Both songs are equally awesome!"
"Alestorm- Sunset on the golden age","I would argue Sunset on the Golden Age is better, but only because I take the full context of the song into account and what it represents. Obviously ""Sunset"" refers to the waning years of the Golden Age of Piracy. The atmosphere of this song is the best part - in all the sections I can feel the decay as the world falls apart.

The slow buildup in the first two minutes is the captain seeing the tide changing, a new age arising, one where he is not welcome, one where the rules of how he, his crew, and his friends have lived for most of their lives. A melancholic glance out across the sea paints the picture of a man who know the only constant is change, and there's no stopping it.

The next few minutes represent preparations for the inevitable. The pirates know they are going into battle. They know few will survive, that their tropical paradise will be a smoking crater, despite other pirates denying it, unaware of the naval invasion about to come. The pirates are readying themselves despite the odds, even as the temptation to live as they had before with their blissfully ignorant friends haunts them.

Finally, the stark change where the guitar turns electric at 6:02. Judgement day. Endless enemies on the horizon. The ones who were unprepared panic as mortars fall. The ones who were prepared do what they know they have to do with a great sense of urgency. 

The captain tells the crew what he was thinking about earlier in the eerily calm beginning, sort of a last-minute pep talk to get them to face death and beat the odds. As they make their escape at 6:58 or so, they set sail, watching the destruction behind them but also looking at the armada in front of them. They prepare for battle.

7:37. The battle begins. It doesn't last long, but the maelstrom is intense. Several pirate ships sail quickly past a few naval ships. A rapid firefight ensures, and several pirate ships are destroyed by cannonfire, but the navy can't stop them all as two or three break through.

8:00. The crew made it through. The naval ships are no longer in pursuit/the ones that were have been damaged too much to pursue. The crew know this is a Pyrrhic victory though, because they sail away into both a literal and figurative sunset. They are unwelcome wherever they sail. 

9:40. The sun has set. Night has fallen. The entropic decay begins to consume them. Their once adventurous lives are now basically over. Homeless, they sail and survive, but are they really even living anymore? This is where the song truly brings in the atmosphere that it started in the beginning to its conclusion. These pirates don't just simply fade away, they rot away as the corrosive salty ocean kills them far more slowly and painfully than the naval forces ever would..."
"Alestorm- Sunset on the golden age","I'm weak to this band. They've got such a sense of humor, sense of what's awesome. Wish I could see them live! "
"Alestorm- Sunset on the golden age","I've seen them in September! This was the best concert I ever attended (not like I'm a veteran or something). The fact that it was in a club, not on a huge stage made everything soooo much better.

"Serious Black - High and Low (Supergroup, 2015: music video featuring Thomen Stauch, Roland Grapow, and Urban Breed)","Urban Breed has always been a fucking monster of a singer

In terms of talent it feels like he should be just as known as singers like Jorn, Russel Allen etc but he's never had his breakthrough

Tad Morose was amazing though"

"What is the single best song by a given band?","Wintersun has a big Power Metal sound too. Sons of Winter and Stars in definitely one of the best songs ever. I can't wait for Time II, but unfortunately I'll have to keep waiting. "
"What is the single best song by a given band?","Well, it took them eight years between albums last time, so even if they didn't release their next one until 2019, it would still technically be an improvement."

"What is the single best song by a given band?","I pretty much agree with this, except I have Reasons to Live from Ultra Beatdown for DragonForce and The Divine Wings of Tragedy for Symphony X."
"What is the single best song by a given band?","Reasons to Live has one of my most fav solo sections; it's really dynamic. I was comparing it to Evening Star and Valley of the Damned though, and I can't explain why but Evening Star is my favorite. As for SX, Divine Wings is amazing, but the start of the solo in When All is Lost really hits me more. "
"What is the single best song by a given band?","More than fair. I picked Reasons to Live because I felt it was one of DragonForce's best efforts at writing lyrics that have more depth than the standard generic power/heavy metal fare they also use (see something like Inside the Winter Storm, Above the Winter Moonlight, or even Soldiers of the Wasteland, which are by no means bad songs).

The Divine Wings of Tragedy was one of the first albums that got me into more progressive music, so I'm biased."
"What is the single best song by a given band?","Actually now that I'm looking at my music library, I might put ""Last Man Stands"" above Evening Star. Again, I can't explain it. DragonForce isn't one of the bands I particularly pick out lyricism but I do think they got better after Inhuman Rampage. I like their recent albums which have tighter songwriting, but I kind of miss the really long 9 minute songs; maybe they can do a 10+ minute one day.

Fair point about Divine Wings although my favorite on that album is Of Sins and Shadows. I think Twilight in Olympus is one of their most underrated albums though. Dream Theater is the band that got me into progressive music. If you like prog metal like SX, you should listen to Suspyre. Highly recommended especially their album When Time Fades..."
"What is the single best song by a given band?","Good to see some love for Pride Of The Tyrant. One of their best for sure. Such a same neither of the Rhapsody's ever played the song live. "
"What is the single best song by a given band?","Glad to see other people love Pride of the Tyrant too. I think it's one of their most underrated songs. I need to give their discography more listens, but I like Power of the Dragonflame more than the deified Symphony of Enchanted Lands. "
"What is the single best song by a given band?","I agree on that count too. Power Of The Dragonflame is my favorite album of theirs(and possibly my favorite album overall). It's perfect mix of heaviness and symphonic elements.  "
"What is the single best song by a given band?","**Power Quest** - [Far Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpQKCHMNPk4)

* [Amberian Dawn--Arctica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTpSItforgY)

And I'm out of time, for now"
"What is the single best song by a given band?","I guess there's a lot of love for ""Master of Sorrow."" ""Down from the Mountain"" was my fav from their latest album but I haven't given it many listens, although their first album is still my favorite."
"What is the single best song by a given band?","Magnus Karlsson is brilliant (Allen Lande 1-3 and Kiske-Somerville). While the vocals tend not to be as soaring high as his main material, it seems like it lets the singers relax a little"

* Sabaton - Ghost Division

* Gamma Ray - Rebellion in Dreamland

* Stratovarius - Darkest Hours

* Dream Evil - Back from the Dead
* Edguy - Theater of Salvation

* Heavenly - Time Machine
* Hibria - Stare at Yourself
* Keldian - Hyperion
* Pathfinder - The Whisper of Ancient Rocks
* Persuader - Judas Immortal
* Rhapsody of Fire - Sad Mystic Moon/The Myth of the Holy Sword
"
"What is the single best song by a given band?","Solid list. 
It's so hard to pick the best Dream Evil song for me, and though Back From the Dead is top 5, I'm going to have to tie it at Live a Lie/In Flames You Burn.
"
"What is the single best song by a given band?","In Flames You Burn definately is a strong contender for best Dream Evil song in my opinion. I'd say that one and The Prophecy would round out my top picks.  "
"What is the single best song by a given band?","I offer up

**Kamelot - Forever**

This song has so much emotion adapted from the original Grieg. Simple structure, but it works so well. Aggressive riffs, skillfull solos, all overlaid with Khan's voice like orgasmic honey butter. This to me is the quintessential symphonic power metal track. 

**Galneryus - Destiny**

Don't get me wrong, New Legend and Angel of Salvation are within ɛ of Destiny; this was not an easy pick. But while New Legend showcased Yama-B's vocal power and the most efficient three solo song I've heard, and Angel of Salvation is a simple masterpiece of adaptation from Tchaikovsky, Destiny takes the cake in terms of pure mind-blowing talent in the solos as well as being a bit more focused than Angel of Salvation. Plus, and this is my opinion, but I think Sho's soaring vocals mesh better with Galneryus' neo-classical style than Yama-B's.

P.S. I heard that Syu fingered a woman once and she died"
"What is the single best song by a given band?","I agree about Kamelot, maybe I'd tie it with ""Karma."" As for Galneryus, Destiny is top 3 material, but I'd go with ""Angel of Salvation"" despite the Tchaikovsky adaptation. Although in terms of guitar, ""The Phoenix"" can't be beat! "

"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","###Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Pt. 1: 2001 - 2008)
Fellow warriors, welcome to the Avantasia write-up that I promised *last week*! It's late, since I decided to first redo my favorite releases post for January. Because of space constraints, this Avantasia write-up has to be covered in two separate posts. This first part covers *The Metal Opera* part 1 and 2, both parts of *Lost in Space*, and *The Scarecrow*. The second part, covering the last three albums, should arrive in a couple of days.

Before we begin, I want to make clear that I'm in no way an expert on Power Metal or on music. I'm just a guy who's passionate about this genre of music and like to write / discuss about it. My reviews of bands are, ultimately, subjective endeavors. Your own opinion is not guaranteed to be represented in my writings, but you are welcome and encouraged to share your own opinions in the comments! Most of you are already aware of this, but I wanted to reiterate it before writing about one of the genre's most beloved bands.

*****  
###About the band  
**Genre**: Symphonic Power Metal  
**Country**: Germany

Avantasia is the prime example of a Power Metal supergroup. The project is the brainchild of Tobias Sammet, vocalist and primary songwriter of **Edguy**. Sammet is the main vocalist of Avantasia, appearing on most (*if not all*) songs. Avantasia also has an incredible line-up of guest vocalists. Many big names in metal has visited the Avantasia club at one point or another. Drawing a comparison to Edguy, which produces album after album with awesome, funny and catchy Power Metal, Avantasia is more down-to-earth and serious.

Originally, Sammet planned for Avantasia to be a one-off project, consisting only of the *Metal Opera* albums. That explains the void between *The Metal Opera Pt. 2* in 2002 and *Lost in Space* in 2007 - It took about 5 years before Sammet decided to make Avantasia a permanent Power Metal act. And we're all glad he did. Avantasia has been putting out albums regularly ever since, and according to Wikipedia, Sammet said that the latest album, *The Mystery of Time*, will definitely have a sequel. He ain't done yet!

**Line-up** (permanent studio members):

* **Vocals**: Tobias Sammet  
* **Guitars**: Sascha Paeth (2006 +), Henjo Richter (2000 - 2002)  
* **Bass**: Tobiast Sammet (2006 +), Markus Grasskopf (2000 - 2002)
* **Keyboards, Orchestration**: Michael ""Miro"" Rodenberg (2006 +), Tobias Sammet (2000 - 2002)    
* **Drums**: Russel Gilbrook (2012 +), Eric Singer (2006 - 2012), Alex Holzwarth (2000 - 2002)

###The Metal Opera

Both parts of *The Metal Opera* are very similar to each other, yet vastly different from anything Avantasia has put out later. *The Metal Opera* sounds like a throwback to early Power Metal with some added symphonic elements.

##Part 1 (2001)  
After the obligatory intro, the album sees a pretty decent start with ""Reach Out for the Light"" (ft. Kiske). The verses smash you in the face with awesomeness, but sadly the chorus is much less catchy and kinda breaks the pace. ""Serpents in Paradise"" (ft. David DeFeis) is another great track, with a sweet intro guitar riff and great vocals, and a pretty happy-vibe chorus even though the song name would suggest otherwise.  
The best song on the album, in my opinion, is ""**Glory of Rome**"". This one has THREE guest vocalists: Oliver Hartmann, Ralf Zdiarstek and Rob Rock. I'm not familiar with these specific vocalist and it's difficult to tell which one does which segments. Whoever sings the segment from 0:47 - 1:08 is awesome, though! Good, speedy riffs and drums accentuate the song perfectly. This is a real classic!  
The rest of the album is more or less forgettable in my opinion. The album finisher, ""The Tower"", has Kiske, Hartmann and DeFeis, as well as Timo Tolkki and Andre Matos. Are you sure you have enough vocalists there, Sammet!? The song is okay-ish, but can't really keep my interest for its 9 minute duration. 

##Part 2 (2002)  
The album opens with ""The Seven Angels"", which is 14 minutes long. It has its good moments, but it's not really good enough to keep my interest for the entirety of the song's length, and it changes pace too much. Track #2 is ""No Return"" (ft. Kiske and Matos), which is the first noteworthy song. The guitar intro is decent enough, and the instrumentation is good throughout the song. The vocals start off in a standard fashion (so far as *The Metal Opera* is concerned), but smashes you in the face with the most memorable vocal segment on both of these albums: 0:48 - 0:59. *Until the morning light, illuminate the night, be the light on our side*. It returns at 2:15 - 2:24, and even in guitar solo form at 3:15 - 3:25. Even so, I still wish there would be more of it, it's so darn catchy whereas the rest of the vocals are *just okay*.  
From then on, the album consists of mostly forgettable tracks (again, *in my opinion*), broken off with ""The Final Sacrifice"" in between. David DeFeis returns as a guest vocalist here. The song's pretty badass, with heavy riffs and rough-y vocals that are maybe a little over the top at some points. I like it though!  
Near the end we reach the final noteworthy song of the album: ""**Memory**"". Ralf Zdiarstek returns here, and man, I've never heard of this guy before but he's the best thing to happen to these albums. I suspect he's the one that has that super awesome segment in ""Glory of Rome"" as well. ""Memory"" has a nifty guitar riff going on, and this song has one of the coolest guitar solos on the *Metal Opera* albums. The second verse, between 2:06 and 2:40, is incredible.

##Conclusion (*The Metal Opera*)
*The Metal Opera* marks the beginning of something fantastic. Both albums have their own gems, most notably ""The Glory of Rome"" from part 1 and ""Memory"" from part 2. The first one is decidedly the most solid album of the two, as is evident by its spot in our Essential albums list. The albums are largely similar in style, yet vastly different from later Avantasia albums. Personally, I prefer the style of the later albums. Another testament to how my opinion differs from the norm! YAY ME!  

*****  
###Lost in Space (2007)  
In 2007, Avantasia returned with two separate EPs titled Lost in Space (Part 1 and 2 respectively). The EPs are obviously centered around the single ""Lost in Space"", which is featured a total of three times across both EPs. The original single is featured on both EPs, and Part 2 also has a live version. PLS LIKE LOST IN SPACE PLS. Both EPs also has two cover songs, as well as 2-3 new songs.

##Part 1
""Lost in Space"" immediately showcases the shift in style from *The Metal Opera*: It is less speed-oriented, the vocals are more prominent and focal in the mix, and naturally the recording quality is a bit higher. The titular track is a generally calm song, focusing more on melody and vocals than on instrumentation. Basically, it's not a Power Metal track. Because of that, the song is more accessible to the general public, which probably helped for promotional purposes. I like it, but would hardly consider it an essential Avantasia song.  
The next track is an ABBA cover. I don't care about ABBA songs at all, but dammit, this one really works in Power Metal form! Or well, it is mostly the verses that sound good. They are more speed-based than the chorus, which makes it fit better with Power Metal.  
Then we get to an original song, ""**Another Angel Down**"". Wait, who's the guest vocalist here? Modda fokkin JORN, that's who. Okay so Jorn is my favorite vocalist and I may sound biased as hell, but this is easily the best track across both EPs. Not only because Jorn is there, but also because of the nifty intro guitar riff and the overall instrumentation.  
""The Story ain't Over"" is a forgettable ballad. ""Ride the Sky"" is a Lucifer's Friend cover, which has the drummer (Eric Singer) doing part of the vocals. It's a pretty enjoyable song, I guess.

##Part 2
Also this EP starts off with the titular track, followed by an original song called ""Promised Land"". There are two guest vocalists here: Jorn and Kiske. Hearing so many great vocalist in one track is pretty awesome. The song is very nice, but I consider it less essential than ""Another Angel Down"".  
And then, just because he could, Sammet did a cover of ""Dancing with Tears in my Eyes"" by Ultravox. Pretty weird... and it actually sounds all right.  
Next up is an original song, ""Scary Eyes"", which is decent but forgettable. It is followed by a cover of ""In my Defense"" by Freddie Mercury. Great, more ballads... And if you REALLY want to, you can listen to the last track which is a live recording of ""Lost in Space"". To make it even more exciting, it's ACOUSTIC! WOO... oo.

##Conclusion (*Lost in Space*)  
The *Lost in Space* EPs were effectively building up the release of the next album, *The Scarecrow*. Both the titular track and ""Another Angel Down"" are featured on that album as well. The EPs may still be worth checking out because of some unique tracks such as ""Promised Land"".

*****  
###The Scarecrow (2008)  
This album marks the beginning of the contemporary musical style of Avantasia, although it was already sampled in the *Lost in Space* EPs. *The Scarecrow* is part of *The Wicked Symphony* trilogy, consisting of this album and two albums released simultaneously in 2010.  
Getting right to it, the album is opened by ""Twisted Mind"" (ft. Roy Khan). This song is pretty great, and you should definitely check it out. It has kind of a creepy vibe, which is what they were going for judging by the song title.  
The second track is the title track, ""**The Scarecrow**"". This song is 11 minutes long and I usually have a bit of a gripe with longer tracks, but this one is fantastic. With the exception of a nonsensical pause in the pace between 4:15 - 6:15, this song is awesome through and through. The sweet violin intro is supported by tribe-like drums (in lack of a better term), soon accentuated with symphonic elements. The pace of the song is generally slow, but it's a powerful track despite that fact. Sammet sounds incredibly epic here. *There's a voice and a million answers to the questions I don't ask*. And oh yeah, Jorn is back! He starts singing the second verse. There's so much awesomeness packed into this song, and the melody is really memorable. As I mentioned, the pace is broken for two minutes, before it returns with more awesomeness.  
The title track is followed by ""Shelter from the Rain"" (ft. Kiske), which I found to be decent but forgettable. Then we have ""Carry me Over"", which was released in single form before. It's another ballad, and while I enjoy the occasional ballad, this one is skippable. Speaking of ballads, ""What Kind of Love"" (ft. Amanda Somerville) is another one.  
""Another Angel Down"" makes a return. After that, we've got Alice Cooper on ""The Toy Master"". This is another song with a creepy vibe. You do have to like Alice Cooper to like this track. Next up is ""**Devil in the Belfry**"" (ft. Jorn), which is one of the most explosive tracks on the album. Sammet and Jorn are a deadly duo, which this track is an excellent example of. Alternating lines works really well, and the chorus is incredible. Jorn bias much? Maybe... what can ya do.  
If you didn't get enough ballads, you can listen to ""Cry Just a Little"". The final original song on the album is ""I Don't Believe in your Love"" (ft. Oliver Hartmann). This one's pretty great as well. Intriguingly, Sammet is fine with singing ""Don't give a fuck"", whereas Hartmann prefers ""Don't give a damn"". The album finishes with ""Lost in Space"" for good measure.

*****  
###Conclusion (Part 1)  
**TL;DR**: Check out these songs: ""The Glory of Rome"", ""Memory"", ""Another Angel Down"", ""The Scarecrow"" and ""Devil in the Belfry"".

Part two should be on its way. I'd promise to have it out by Friday, but something always seems to come up and I end up delaying stuff... I'll try though!"
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","Thanks for this - this is great.

And either your opinion differs from the norm or mine does because, as far as favorite songs, I'd put *The Glory of Rome* and *Memory* for sure in the bottom 5 or so. And *The Seven Angels* probably amongst the top. 

Additionally, I think *Shelter From The Rain* is the best recorded track on *The Scarecrow*, so meh (though live version of *The Scarecrow* is 100x better than the studio version).

As for the vocalist in *The Glory of Rome* that you're referring to - that's Rob Rock. He's awesome in everything.


EDIT: I still think some of the most impressive stuff is how young Tobias is when he wrote all this. He was ~22-23 when he wrote and composed all this music. I guess that's not ""young"" in his career since he had Edguy going from when he was like 17/18, but still. . ."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","Glory of Rome on the bottom 5???? I couldn't disagree more, it's easily one of the strongest song on the album."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","I'm way in the minority here.

*The Tower* &gt; *Sign of the Cross* &gt; *Farewell* &gt; *Reach Out For The Light* &gt; *Serpents In Paradise* &gt; *Inside* &gt; *The Glory of Rome* &gt; *Avantasia* &gt; *Breaking Away*

So maybe not bottom 5, but nothing special. I forgot how bad *Breaking Away* is. And *Avantasia* is too generic. 

Honestly, that album really isn't as good as I remember it being so many years ago.

"
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","I have the same feeling, it felt really magical hearing the metal opera albums for the first time but time did took a toll and now... now I can't stand those albums and if I ever spin the records, I end up passing everything and the only song I really enjoy is *The Tower*."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","I'd put Avantasia in front of Serpents, but otherwise that's pretty much my ranking as well."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","Spot on, I appreciate the ordering of this list and The Seven Angels is easily in the top spot for the 2nd metal opera."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","It was pretty difficult to pick favorites from the *Metal Opera* albums. I'm honestly not that fond of those albums... I understand why it's a classic, but I feel that it has aged quite a bit. Anyway, the vocals in ""The Glory of Rome"" put it on top for me, especially thanks to Rob Rock (thanks for the heads up on that). The same goes for ""Memory"" on part 2.

That's pretty amazing, didn't think about how young he'd be! Makes sense since it's ~14 years old and he's not hit 40 yet."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","Avantasia introduced me to the world of power metal. It's suprising but thanks to this band i've found out about Micheal Kiske, Jorn Lande and many other great vocalist"
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","I found Avantasia through Jorn, actually! And from there, Edguy."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","I'd have to disagree with your thoughts on TMO Pt. I&amp;II totally. By the time I reached the second sentence of your pt. II review I had to stop reading.

The Tower &amp; The Seven Angels is one of the greatest album closer/opener pairs in power metal.

I think what you're distinctly lacking is the fact that as ""opera's"" / concept albums, that the story and songs work together to form part of a whole. Listening to each individual track and saying; ""oh yeah that has a mean double kick and fast tempo, that's awesome power metal"" (Glory of Rome) doesn't do any of the songs individually, or the album as a whole, the justice they deserve.

Sure, after 14 years I rarely spend two hours listening to Pt I &amp; II in order back to back. However for anyone who is new to Avantasia and getting into these albums, it's best to play the entire album, and try to listen to what's happening in the story. About 10 or 12 years ago on Tobias' old website he had a German, and English translation of the entire story of the albums. It's a pity it's gone and I haven't been able to find it anywhere recently.

It's unfortunate that he didn't make a Pt III.  While albums from 2007 onwards are good, Tobias may as well have renamed the group, as the music is considerably different, he was just trying to piggyback off the success of the first two."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","&gt;Tobias may as well have renamed the group

What is it with people and wanting groups to change their name when they change their sound a bit? Is it really inconceivable that someone might be interested in more than one type of music, and they might see their band/group/project/etc. as more than just fitting in one box?"
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","My reviews are song-oriented. Concept albums are no different. There's no right or wrong, just different ways of looking at things."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","However, doesn't that kind of way do a disjustice to the album as a whole? After all, it's supposed to be not a mere concept album but a whole *opera* (in the name at least, don't know if some classical music buffs would agree that it fits the definition)."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","Well yeah. You could argue that I have never done justice to any particular album I have reviewed. I consciously opted for a song-orientation over album-orientation because that's how *I* listen to music.

I can understand that some people are disappointed that I don't worship particular albums into the clouds. That criticism may be a little misplaced, though - my reviews aren't supposed to be objective accounts of essential albums in the first place. We've got the Essentials list for that. "
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","Woah, hold your hyperboles, man. I didn't actually anything much about what I think about it. Should it be worshipped? It's good but not the ultimate masterpiece; it doesn't always succeed at what's it trying to do, ideally even the 'low-intensity' parts that are serve as build-up to ones that 'kick' (yes, I don't know musical theory at all) would be memorable, too, and I can't say that about all of pt. 2. ...  I don't have idea what how an objective review would even look like. 

I found your review a couple of weeks ago and I like them (otherwise I wouldn't bother to read), and so to find you don't say anything at all about the thing as a whole was a slight disappointment. 

Maybe I came across as obnoxius, but strictly focusing on the invididual pieces only ""because that's how I listen to music"" (no matter the album) just strikes me as weird (it wouldn't suit some other genres at all). But I guess we don't discuss that there are other ways, then. (*Seven Angels* &gt; *Sign of the Cross* &gt; *The Glory of Rome* &gt; ... )."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","Didn't mean to exaggerate.

I don't think you come across as obnoxious, I just wanted to make clear that the purpose of these band writeups is to hand-pick my favorite tracks and throw them together in a YouTube playlist. It's all very personal and subjective, which I have been trying to make clear from the very beginning and have been reiterating - but there are always new readers who don't catch up on that and expect something else.

If you come to expect something that I never set out to provide in the first place, you'll obviously meet disappointment.

Reading back, I didn't even neglect the holistic view that much. About both albums, I wrote that apart from the mentioned tracks, the rest of the albums were largely forgettable (which is subjective, mind you). Then, in the conclusion, I wrote that each album had their own gems, and that part 1 is decidedly more solid than part 2. The only bit that I left implicit is that the albums aren't very consistent.

What more could I have said about the albums, without sacrificing my subjectivity?"
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","&gt; About 10 or 12 years ago on Tobias' old website he had a German, and English translation of the entire story of the albums. It's a pity it's gone and I haven't been able to find it anywhere recently.

I have the complete story in my Metal Opera Gold Edition, might as well post it here in the upcoming days?"
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","Yeah please do, that would be great! I haven't read it since back then."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","Interesting write up. Nice one!

As an aside, Avantasia seems to divide fans into: I like epic power metal and I like hard rock. I don't mind the later albums but I wish, really wish, Tobi would give us one last Metal Opera style cheesy glorious flood of tongue-in-cheek fantasy metal."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","You kind of had that with The Mystery of Time.  It really felt to me that he manged to blend Metal Opera and Scarecrow quite skillfully on the album.

At this point, if he were to revert back to full Metal Opera, I'm not sure it would sound like anything buy somebody trying to recapture their glory days."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","It shuffled slightly further down towards the metal opera side of the spectrum that's true. Yeah I guess I'd be concerned it might sound forced if he tried to do it again but anyone who know's Tobi knows he's up for a laugh and not taking himself seriously. I bet he's got a nerdy epic inside him when he's done playing rock star."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","I really like The Metal Opera, although Part II was a bit disappointing.  The pacing is a bit off and it may have lacked some effort.  I feel like The Seven Angels would have been better as a final track on Part I. "
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","This may be the first time we've agreed on a stand out track. Glory of Rome is one of my favorite Avantasia songs"
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","[Success!](http://media.giphy.com/media/zaqclXyLz3Uoo/giphy.gif)"
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","I'm really only familiar with the first two albums. I have listened to some songs of later-era Avantasia here and there (most notably ""Where Clock Hands Freeze"" and ""Dying for an Angel"") but nothing held my attention for long.

That being, said, Metal Opera I is an absolute beast of an album. ""Sign of the Cross"" and ""Glory of Rome"" are classics but my favorite is probably ""Reach Out for the Light"". Pretty much every song is decent. Can't say the same for II where only ""The Seven Angels"", ""In Quest For"" and ""No Return"" jumped out at me. "
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","The Scarecrow is easily my favorite bit of power metal ever. Jorn's notes, man. 'Better off to cry contrite tears' just fucking MAKES it so fantastic."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","Dude, I swear to god as soon as I saw this post I knew you were going to add *Devil In The Belfry* and *The Scarecrow* to the list, the Jorn factor is too powerful. I can't deny how much Jorn contributes to make these songs go from good to fucking great.

Also, Lost In Space is easily one of the shittiest songs made by Tobias, it's pop bullshit just to appeal to a bigger crowd. The shittiest song is, of course, Sleekwalk (Sleepwalking?), If you want to keep your power metal card, you have to bash this song in the next post or I'm gonna be really angry."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","Ha! I made the same post about the singles they've released (*Lost in Space* / *Carry Me Over* / *Sleepwalking*) and deleted it because I realized it didn't have a ton of relevance to this discussion.

But, yes, 100% agreed. If someone finds Avantasia from the singles, they're going to be pleasantly surprised."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","Jorn is love, Jorn is life. :D

I can listen to Lost in Space and Sleepwalking and enjoy them for what they are, but in Power Metal terms they're terrible. And Carry me Over is terrible even for pop!"
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","The Angel of Babylon has a new version of Promised Land. Saying this as someone that loves Michael Kiske: it wasn't one of his good songs. Holy hell did Tobias Sammet figure out how to use Kiske's voice later though"
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","&gt; it's pop bullshit just to appeal to a bigger crowd

Or maybe it's pop bullshit because Tobias wanted to write pop bullshit? I actually like those songs quite a bit. No, they aren't power metal, but power metal and 'good song' aren't equivalent terms."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","&gt;Or maybe it's pop bullshit because Tobias wanted to write pop bullshit?

I highly doubt it, if there were more songs in the same pop vein, I'd say he truly wanted to change to a poppier sound, but it's not the case because everything else is pretty much fits into metal or rock. Also, the lyrics are completely irrelevant to the albums or at least, I don't see the connection. It's probably an introspection lyric style but it's such a bland and overdone ripoff from bands like U2, Coldplay, Sting and the sorts that it becomes completely irrelevant. If there's something I agree with you is that:

&gt;power metal and 'good song' aren't equivalent terms.

Amen."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 1: 2001 - 2008)","&gt; but it's not the case because everything else is pretty much fits into metal or rock

He's gone into pop-rock with more than those two songs, plus he's gone into pop territory with Edguy. Plus he's covered bands like ABBA and Ultravox. Just because he's not writing every song as a pop rock ballad doesn't mean he's not interested in it - many bands include a song on their albums which are more accessible than the rest. Does Beyond the Red Mirror having a single piano ballad on it mean that Blind Guardian didn't want to write that song?

&gt;Also, the lyrics are completely irrelevant to the albums or at least, I don't see the connection. It's probably an introspection lyric style but it's such a bland and overdone ripoff from bands like U2, Coldplay, Sting and the sorts that it becomes completely irrelevant.

Have you looked at the rest of the lyrics on these albums? Tobias left the medieval fantasy tropes with the Metal Operas."

It's cheesy as hell and they know it.  I just had a grin on my face the whole way through.  The synth lines, drums and sound effects just make the album fun from start to finish.  The lyrics are stupid, the choruses are massive and singable and the riffs are thick.

I wish they made an album like their s/t as I find this one pretty awkward."
"Battle Beast - I Want The World... And Everything In It","I really enjoyed this album. It has lots of epic moments and the ballads/ slower songs have an 80s/90s feel to them, which I quite like. And it is also very cheesy, like one would expect from Battle Beast."
"Battle Beast - I Want The World... And Everything In It","I think if they manage to get one good song in, they'll be in the race for most average album."

**UnlostHorizon's Recommendation of the Week**

I'll be crucified if I don't pick **Blind Guardian**, and rightly so. It's a pretty good album, even by their standards. I'm not a fan of the production, but you'd be an idiot to skip this album or disregard its merits for just that. But since I always like to recommend something you guys may have not already listened to, Wintersun fans should give **Frosttide** a listen.

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/26 - 2/01)","Hey guys, sorry about being gone, I have been in a pretty shitty slump, and needed to sort myself out. Now that I am back though, it's time for some glorious Power Metal!

My Opinion (based on previews only):

- **Reason:** Flows from Video Game Battle Music into a guitar solo and then into a regular Prog Metal song. It's a decent song, with some good variety throughout it, which helps since it is a longer song. I will admit that slower prog isn't as appealing to me as faster stuff, so I wouldn't have minded it sped up or cut shorter, but that is just me. I can't complain about the amount of guitar solos though.

- **Visigoth:** I really like how much faster this song is than the previous from Reason. It has some great variance, jumping into an Acoustic section and then back, and has a great solo. I might be biased by my love for Tabletop RPGs though, so that might be affecting my opinion.

- **Frosttide:** Are you headbanging within 10 seconds? You should be, this is Folk Metal after all. I really like the speed and intensity of the instrumentation. I'm 50/50 about the vocals, because while I like the growl, it seems a little out of tune or time. That might be just me, but it does bother me a bit.

- **Gamma Ray:** I'll skip this because it is an ad and not a song, interesting interview though.

- **Blind Guardian:** Blind Guardian? Come on now, I can only get *so* erect.

What I missed:

- **Alborea:** This is a solid song. The vocals are *Glorious*, and the instrumentation is great fun. I like the way they flow between rougher sounds and softer symphonic sounds, it adds an interesting feature to the music. Overall, I enjoyed this a quite a bit.

- **Veonity:** Man this song is fucking great. I had a laugh at the start about how campy the start sounds, but mate the rest is fucking awesome. They certainly don't lose the campiness, but they throw some much more on top that the defining characteristic isn't just that it is over the top. It has amazing levels of drive and speed. I really like this song."

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/26 - 2/01)","My thoughts on the non-compilation PM releases:

* **Visigoth**: Hey, some kick-ass viking metal? This sounds really promising. The instrumentation is nice and fast, the guitars kick some serious ass! These guys sound really interesting but I wasn't satisfied with the vocals in this one (he sings well, I probably just don't like that particular song). I looked around and [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1JB5kA3_o) is a lot better in the vocals department, and kicks some serious ass! It's off their EP, and will be on the actual album and I'm hoping it'll be a remastered version.  
* **Blind Guardian**: I'm not a Blind Guardian fanboy, but holy schmuck ""Twilight of the Gods"" is one magnificent track. I don't know what it is, as people tell me this is pretty standard BG stuff. There's just something else about this track. I guess it's closer to my own personal notion of power metal, or something. It kicks so much ass.  
* **Alborea**: This sounds nice and melodic. The vocals are in Spanish (I think). It's actually pretty damn good instrument-wise, and I'm not a huge fan of the voice but this should be enjoyable for those who don't mind non-English vocals.  
* **Veonity**: A very anthemy (I officially declare anthemy a word) song. It's pretty standard fare PM instrumentation... While there aren't really and bad points to this one, it doesn't really have much to get you excited either. It's enjoyable, but not really memorable. It sounds like every other PM song. Doesn't bring much new to the table, but by all means check these guys out.

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/26 - 2/01)","I opened a new tab for the Visigoth preview. Didn't really think it was any special, and I just kept browsing reddit with the song on. Then the song ended... and a new one started. I didn't notice it at first, but it hit me when I heard growling. Confused, I went to the YT tab. Youtube had randomly started playing a full album video of Job for a Cowboy's 2014 release, *Sun Eater*. And I'm digging the hell out of it. I remember when it was included in the weekly thread about 2 months ago, but I didn't listen to the preview (no one even reviewed it!). So yeah, at least I discovered something that I liked from this thread, hehe.

I've been listening to Blind Guardian's album every day for the past week. It's amazing.

I'm on a similar boat as /u/MisterMillennia when it comes to Frosttide. I really want to like it, but I feel like something's missing.

###Recommendations of the week  
##/u/Fazermint  
Honestly, this week is pretty crappy. Out of this week's releases, I'd recommend **Deus X Machina**, a pretty solid-sounding outing with a nice melodic property and some very decent riffs. It's a re-issue of their 2014 album, though.

On the plus side though, I found a nice little EP that I missed a couple of weeks back: **Nocturna**. These guys haven't got an album out yet, but this EP sounds promising. The vocalist has a slightly boyish voice, but it works. For a debut EP, these guys are pulling some serious tunes.

/u/psychoconductor pointed me to **Ascendia**'s release last week. The preview track is pretty amazing. The instrumentation is pretty basic, but dat singer tho. Sadly, the rest of the album is meh.

##/u/MadTheMad  
This week sucks and so I feel that I can't really recommend anything but if I had to, I'd recommend **Ascendia**'s song ""At the End of it All"", it's nothing new or amazing but it's a good song overall with a good voice behind it and symphonic elements that support rather than take over. They have another song ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdN2ywKo0ak)) but it's generic as fuck and it makes me wonder if the the album is worth buying. ""At the End of it All"" is definitely worth a check.

Honorable mention goes to **Axemaster**'s return to form, they're pretty much retro old school and somehow they have this ""...And Justice For All"" vibe going on here with a production similar to early Anthrax. This is not Power Metal though, it's Heavy Metal with some groove here and there. An interesting weird song but it's just a different shot at the old.

##/u/omegakingauldron  
Recommendation pending

[When I finally gave the Noble Beast album a spin](http://new4.fjcdn.com/thumbnails/comments/Go+get+em+champ+_09aa74b5c1c13540b567393a2414e3d2.gif)"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (3/2 - 3/8)","**Subversion: Imperfect** - Tough egg to crack, the band is labeled Technical Symphonic and I'd say that's pretty accurate even if the symphonic elements aren't very symphony. The song goes through a bunch of twists and turns and doesn't seem to stick to one style: djent-y, technical-y, metalcore-y, it's like eating a vertical layered piece of cake, you never know what's coming next. All in all an interesting song if you are into Periphery (the band) because that's my biggest problem with this song, sounds just like Periphery or Monuments.

**Deus X Machina: The Devourer** - I think what stops this track from being decent power metal are the keyboards, the tone, the melody, it all sounds watered down and boring. It had potential.

**Dimitriy Pavlovskiy's PowerSquad: Journey** - Snoozefest. Again, bad keyboards.

**Impellitteri: (Trailer)** - Impellitteri is an old old band that mounts back to Yngwie's style of shredding and it's surprising to see them since the last album I heard from them was Screaming Symphony (which was generic but good overall). This time around they have Dette on the drums who was drumming and slaying with Slayer for a couple of years or something like that. The trailer showcases some good but generic stuff, there's no new shiny rock to be found here, just some good ol' mid paced Heavy Metal.

**Iron Kobra: Vanguard of Doom** - Short song with that 90s production vibe, just simple old school Heavy Metal.

**Valor: (Teaser)** - Too short and didn't sound very interesting.

What **I** may have missed last week...

**Nocturna: Revelations** - Fucking symphonic elements so candy assed it makes Stratovarius sound like Cannibal Corpse in comparison. Whatever good stuff could ever be here it's drowned in keyboard sugar coating.

**Thundersteel: Outlaws Lament** - The almost obligatory speed metal track that seems to pop up in every weekly releases post. This one is just your standard old school Speed Metal worship.

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (3/2 - 3/8)","Were you late with the thread, or is it now a thing to post them on Mondays/Sundays? I hope it was just the former. I always like getting them on a Saturday, especially the times when I woke up and there was already new thread up.

I hope I don't sound ungrateful or anything. Appreciate the effort! Now, as for this week; it's pretty uninteresting to say the least. "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (3/2 - 3/8)","The post was late. I have 'em ready on Saturday, but I first send it to /u/MadTheMad and /u/omegakindauldron for extra recommendations, so the rule should be to post them on Sunday. Was waiting for omega's recommendations but I guess he's been busy. Anyway, that's why.

If everybody would like them on Saturday, I can start one day earlier, no problem."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (3/2 - 3/8)","Deus X Machina, DP's Powersquad, and Impellitteri sound pretty good. Then again I'm way too open-minded as some people put it. Can someone possibly remove Animi from the list and the album art on the right-hand bar? - It's not even power metal. It barely has symphonic elements and just sounds like technical metalcore. (Given I've only heard the lyric video). The Impellitteri album art might be a good replacement. "

"Nightwish - Élan","Definitely a solid track. Not groundbreaking, but Nightwish seems to have the habit of releasing middle-of-the-road singles alongside much better tracks in the full album, so I'm hopeful for the rest.

Still good to listen to, it's a really ""feel-good"" song.

I recognize that people have different definitions of Power Metal, and if Metal Church fits their definitions, then okay, whatever.  It's still great music."
"Metal Church - Beyond the Black (1984)","I have to give you props for embracing your ignorance."
"Metal Church - Beyond the Black (1984)","""Ignorance"", eh?  Apparently, we have two different definitions of that as well.  I hope this isn't a trend, or I'll wonder if one of us isn't a space alien! :P

Seriously, though.  I'm not quite sure how I feel about this.  I recognize that you're a mod for this subreddit, and (for the moment) I'm certainly not interested in challenging why that is.  One doesn't become a mod without good reason, especially on a sub like this.

That being said, you do seem to be acting rather condescending towards me.  I admit that I'm somewhat new to this sub, as I haven't posted here much, so I can't tell if you're being serious or just trolling me.  It is a bit disconcerting for me.

Now, perhaps you could argue that I was being condescending with my original comment by passive-aggressively asserting my own opinion about Metal Church being Power Metal, and I'll accept that.  I will fully acknowledge that my definitions and distinctions about genres are pedantic, arbitrary, and highly personal.  I have my reasons, and I may endeavor to back them up with arguments that I think make some sense, but I certainly have no delusions over trying to insist that my definitions are perfect and should be used by everyone else.  If people are posting stuff like Metal Church as Power Metal, I certainly don't (and won't) aim to stop them.

However, I don't think I've done any real harm by saying what I said.  It's just my opinion, and, while I do enjoy expressing my opinion about the things I care about (who doesn't?), in my original comment, I was willing to (mostly) set it aside and praise the post because it's a great song by a great band.  Just because it doesn't fit my exact definitions of Power Metal is kind of irrelevant.

I do have an issue with the use of the word ""ignorance"", though  Maybe because I spend too much time on the internet, but far too often the word (and its derivatives) is used to describe opinions that don't match one's own exactly, usually in an effort to discredit other people's opinions, often breaking things down into a contentious, ""Us and Them"" dichotomy, which often leaves little room for middle ground or open-mindedness.

However, I recognize that you're a mod, and I'm (admittedly) assuming that this isn't a word you would throw around lightly, which is why I suspect you're testing me or trolling me or something.  I don't believe you're trying to make enemies.  In short, I just don't know what I'm dealing with, which is I'm left disconcerted.

If there is anything I *should* apologize for, it's the length of this comment.  I admit this is pretty normal for me, partially because I'm English Major and I feel the need to explain things as clearly as I can. I highly doubt you expecting anything this long over something like this, but I felt like I should express my concerns about this conversation before things get any worse."
"Metal Church - Beyond the Black (1984)","My problem is being a mod I guess I'm expected to phrase my posts differently than I'm used to. Still getting used to being green. So I apologize. 

I'm not out to make enemies I'm just abrasive. Don't be afraid to call me a douchebag if that's how you feel. I can tend to be one. 

As for our original disagreement,  thinking over things made me realize my point of view was outdated. There are is so much blending of genres nowadays that it can be left to opinion at times. I don't feel that applies to metal church but we'll just have to agree to disagree. I hope my abrasiveness doesn't dissuade you from posting here in the future, I don't mean any harm. "
"Metal Church - Beyond the Black (1984)","No problem!  I know that mods are people, too.  I didn't mean to turn this into any kind of deal (I know it kind of looks like it because of my wall of text!).  I just wanted to be clear about what was going on is all."

* Sound quality - chances are CDs will be of a higher quality than what's available.

"Blind Guardian - The Holy Grail *NEW SONG!!* (x-post from /r/metal)","So there's a 320 kbps leak out there, and I decided to check it out. The music is a lot better than I expected, and I'm not a BG fan, but the production is atrocious. My friend wasn't wrong with his analysis; it's almost unlistenable. The production is so bad. Please don't tell me I'm the only one who hears this.

And I don't think it's just due to the leak's source. 320 kbps is more than close enough to CD quality for it to not be an issue."
"Blind Guardian - The Holy Grail *NEW SONG!!* (x-post from /r/metal)","The drums are barely there, but other than that i'm not seeing a huge issue. "
"Blind Guardian - The Holy Grail *NEW SONG!!* (x-post from /r/metal)","The production seems pretty good to me, much clearer than A Twist in the Myth and A Night at the Opera at least.

edit: in headphones, its a lot messier sounding without them, but that's Blind Guardian for you."
"Blind Guardian - The Holy Grail *NEW SONG!!* (x-post from /r/metal)","It's just a wall of sound, a brickwall. It's a very good wall of sound, albeit, but there's no dynamic range. There's no ""layering"". for a lack of a better term, between the instruments, the orchestration, and the vocals. Everything's just piled on top of each other. 

I'm using Pioneer HDJ headphones to listen to this right now, and those headphones pick up everything. It's such a shame too."
"Blind Guardian - The Holy Grail *NEW SONG!!* (x-post from /r/metal)","I know what you mean, to me I expected better layering like ""At the Edge of Time"" Hansi's vocals don't really shine in this new album..."
"Blind Guardian - The Holy Grail *NEW SONG!!* (x-post from /r/metal)","Dynamic range, especially in metal, is more of a rare gift than the norm, unfortunately. From the samples I've heard, I can see the layering issue, and there are some times when its become a bit too messy, but overall I can't say I see it as a huge deal. Certainly not at an 'almost unlistenable' level. Also on some higher end headphones."
"Blind Guardian - The Holy Grail *NEW SONG!!* (x-post from /r/metal)","I know exactly what you are talking about.  It is really disappointing me but at least it's not terrible."
"Blind Guardian - The Holy Grail *NEW SONG!!* (x-post from /r/metal)","The production has received a lot of criticism. Though if Twilight of the Gods gives a good taste of it, the only thing that bothers me is the drums, and even then not much. However, I do tend to be more lenient than most when it comes to production."
"Blind Guardian - The Holy Grail *NEW SONG!!* (x-post from /r/metal)","It's missing not just drums, but to me it seems like they forgot about the low end. I'm not a bass lover, but it sounds like the leak is missing the lows almost all around. I thought it might have been the leak....but then I listened to the Youtube version, exact same thing....

EDIT: I take back my statement about the lows....it's the vocals that are just muddled randomly. They don't sound like a separate track like they should, it sounds like whoever did the mixing just put vocals in with the guitar and popped it in. To me what makes BG so great is the vocals and they just aren't shining in this album like they should be....At the Edge of Time was a perfect example of where I thought this album would start with a jumping off point....and while good, it's let me down a bit."
"Blind Guardian - The Holy Grail *NEW SONG!!* (x-post from /r/metal)","It's late, and I'm too tired to give this album a proper listening, but my first impression is that, while it is good, it seems to be missing something crucial.  Layering maybe? Dynamic range? I was a big fan of their last three albums and the direction the band was heading in, but maybe this album just doesn't have the spirit of the others.

I'll try again tomorrow. :P"

"Idea for a community project: Themed ""mixtape"" videos","Lately I've been toying around with the idea of creating YouTube videos consisting of a number of same-themed songs. You know, not an actual video in terms of animating stuff or whatever, just with the album art of the song currently playing and random images relating to the theme (not like people sit and watch these things anyway).

I've been planning to do one centered around Fairyland's ""Score to a New Beginning"", i.e. ""serene"" power metal. I've been looking for songs with the same sonic vibe rather than focusing on lyrics, but maybe it's an idea to use lyrics as themes, too. So far I've found [Revolution Renaissance - Into the Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5seLcRVJ6o) and Symphony X's ""When All is Lost"" and/or ""Paradise Lost"", although the latter two have pretty dramatic lyrics.

So if people are interested, we could make this into a thing. People can suggest themes or make their own, and we collaborate on determining the tracklist. Things like length should be discussed, etc.

Just throwing stuff directly out of my brain, let me know what you think.  
Edit: Lol forgot the link  
Edit 2: Maybe themes should be a little more general than ""serene"", e.g. just symphonic power metal, or songs with excellent symphonic instrumentation, or what have you."

Am I on the right track for ""serene"" power metal?"
"Idea for a community project: Themed ""mixtape"" videos","Pretty good picks. Out of those I'd probably put ""Elan"" and ""The Boy who Wanted to be a Real Puppet"" closest to ""Score to a New Beginning"". But the scope of the theme would naturally be up for discussion"
"Idea for a community project: Themed ""mixtape"" videos","So basically... like a youtube themed playlist?"
"Idea for a community project: Themed ""mixtape"" videos","Essentially, yes. Just in one video, rather than multiple."
"Idea for a community project: Themed ""mixtape"" videos","I honestly hate playlists, I pretty much only listen to entire albums so I think I'm gonna stay clear of this one. I'm trying to find something like what you mentioned but I can't really see anything, mainly because I fail to see how Score to a New Beginning fits the ""serene"" description, it's more epic than anything else imo."

"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?",""
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","I've been liking enough of the recent releases of this genre overall. I especially love what's been happening with Kiske's voice. "
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","Hard to say cos nostalgia will always blur things a bit I guess the genre found it's footing and had it's glory years in the decade spanning late 80s to late 90s. I personally love 97-03 ish for nostalgic reasons. 

IMHO I think since then we've had another boom and golden age. We've seen our fair share of generic ones sure but we've also seen some unique stuff and some bands really pushing the envelope and production has only gotten better and more ambitious. Power metal has never been so diverse and varied. The wealth of and access to new, unsigned bands is great. The downsides arguably are once great vocalists losing their touch (Kai, Tobi), some gimmicky acts and a few decent bands mis-stepping with an album or two. Nothing that isn't common to every music genre I'm sure."
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","The late 90's to early 2000's (1997 - 2002) is an amazing time. Great amount of metal came out then."
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","Early 00's was the best era by far. Back when the biggest bands actually played metal instead of pop music."
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","Nah man, 2014 was by far the best year bro, we got babymetal, new amaranthe, twilight force, dragonforce oh so inspired album, schaffers fresh riffs and a billion totally *un*distinguable jpm albums. What do you mean by pop music? Can't you hear amaranthe sick metal riffs?"
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","What are you talking about? They are totally distinguishable. That one band is little girls and that other one is sexy vampires. "
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","All the old stuff is still there for you to listen to

And more stuff is continually being released.

So, in my opinion, the present is the best, and will only continue to continue being the best."
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","For the sake of discussion its safe to say op was talking about each year in a vacuum. "
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","You're not answering his question; he is asking about the best outputs of power metal in a particular year (or years) and what has changed since those times. 

To answer the OP, the best years for me were early to late 1980's. Manilla Road, Jag Panzer, Liege Lord, Scanner. I can't bring myself to listen to most modern power metal. "
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","The best years are:

1988, 1989, 1990, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2015.

The year of release of the 10 best power metal album of all time, by a very very large margin.
"
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","Most of my personal favorite stuff is from the first decade of this millennium.

The genre is becoming more diverse, good in some cases and bad in other cases."
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","**2003.** No question.

"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","Mate... Thank you! I only listened to Twilightning on that huge 5 disc power metal album years ago. Giving em a thorough listen now. Cheers dude!

Also, Lost Horizon as fuck \m/"
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","What huge 5 disc power metal album? I've never heard of such an album / compilation before. I'm intrigued."
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","Ok so turns out Twilightning WEREN'T on the compilation I was talking about (I just rememebr hearing them around that time).

The compilation is called ""Absolute Power Metal - The Definitive Collection"".

Here's one of the first pages I found on it that's NOT a link to a torrent :P

Have a listen mate, it's a nice collection of tracks. Should keep you busy for a while!

Also, why the fuck do I get a downvoted? Usually metalheads are not so downvotey. Must not be true metalheads."
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","2001-2005ish. Because that's when I discovered it and nostalgia, right?

I see power metal as a very vocalist-driven genre and I think most of the genres best vocalists were in their absolute prime around 2003ish (Heiman, Khan, Poyhia, Parcharidis, Kakko, Cans, Kotipelto, Falaschi, etc.). Most of those great bands have since disbanded or have just gotten too old."
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","Don't forget Blad!"
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","Imho Kotipelto never had a prime and Kakko is at his best now."
"What do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?","Late 90s, when the albums weren't overproduced to shit."

**~~SinuataBouquet's~~ UnlostHorizon's Recommendation of the Week**

Should we be holding a moment of silence for our fallen brother who hasn't been on Reddit in over 20 days? Anyways, we've got a lot of big names putting out albums this week. I'm sure some of us have already listened to the Angra album, and while it's pretty good, it's nothing earth-shattering. One band who I've never been able to get into and a band that I hope can change my thoughts on them is **Orden Ogan**. ""F.E.V.E.R."" is a pretty good song by anyone's standards, and I've heard good things from a friend of mine who's been listening to the album for a while now. Maybe I can finally start to like them. On another note, **BABYMETAL**.

Btw, Cyntia, get your shit together! What's up with all this J-rock crap?

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","Slap my ass, a new Vexillum album!!!"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","With Hansi Kürsch as a guest vocal!"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","Most amazing thing about Hansi is you just immediately recognize his voice."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","I recognized Hansi even though I've heard very little of his work. So yeah."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","The first interesting week of 2015, I'd say! Time for my ultra-biased opinions! I'll limit it to the PM releases only.

* **Alpha Tiger**: Uh. Well. Manpigs with bats, keeping people captive. ""We won't take it anymore"". Way to simplify your own message. Oh well. The song is boring, repetitive instrumentation, and while the vocalist sounds like he has potential, this song just sucks. Calling this power metal is actually quite generous.  
* **Armageddon**: DEATH METAL, UNCLEAN VOCALS, RAGE. I'm not joking about the rage, they're so angry that they are flinging their guts through space.  
* **Shadowbane**: The singer be like.. Yeah I'm doing a music video, and I'm sooo owning it. Anyway. This isn't as bad as Alpha Tiger, but it hardly feels like PM either. The vocalist is decent and the guitar solo is pretty good, but the song lacks vocal melody (chorus is all right), and the instrumentation could have been taken from a generic metal band.  
* **Angra**: It's Angra, HYPE TO THE MAX! Kay so I've not listened to Angra much, shame on me. It sounds pretty good, I'm getting this album. The solo is sogud. I'm still waiting to be able to listen to ""Black Hearted Soul"", since /u/UnlostHorizon says that's the best track of the song. Oh and the fabulos lion, Fabio Lione, fronts this release! MOAR HYPE PLS.  
* **Vexillium**: Now THIS sounds like Power Folk done right!  
* **Orden Ogan**: Orden Ogan sounds great as usual. Powerful and catchy vocals, great chorus, superb instrumentation with kickass guitars and even some violins here and there (at least I think they are violins.. I'm terrible at telling).  
* **Satan's Host**: Hey, mostly clean vocals! This is not bad at all. Wouldn't class it as PM, but hey. It sounds like Iron Maiden in many aspects, particularly the guitar solo.  
* **Cyntia**: Even /u/UnlostHorizon doesn't like this. You now know enough, steer clear of this.  
* **Roman Khrustalev**: 17 minutes?! Oh the time and effort I put into this. The song only kicks off at 2:10, and from there it's pretty awesome all the way through. It's instrumental only, and I don't feel that vocals would have been necessary. The music is very well written, and it's got a very serene vibe to it. Check it out if you like long progressive metal.  

Allrighty then. Highlights for me were Angra and Orden Ogan. Thank you, /u/UnlostHorizon, for covering for the mysteriously vanished /u/SinuataBouquet."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","If you haven't listened to Vexillum before, do yourself a favor and familiarize yourself with The Bivouac. "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","[Here's that Angra song I like to rave about so much.](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2dzrtd_angra-black-hearted-soul-from-secred-garden-2014-or-2015_music)"

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","Wow, Wyzard is putting out another release? I actually took a couple of lessons from Buster (the lead singer) several months ago! Dude's still going hard, and helped me push my own sound along to sounding better than it had been at the time. Can't wait to see what he puts out next!"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","I'm afraid it's just a compilation album. "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","Ah, I see. I got a little too excited lol"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","F.E.V.E.R should be good judging by everything else they have released. But yeah, Angra, I'm not sure why such a big band would choose a vocalist from another big band who has such a unique voice as a replacement but anyway. Fabio tries to copy Eduardo too much but it's still a good album. 
[Me backstage at BABYMETAL] (http://imgur.com/IRP8to3)"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","STOP KICKING STAN! (that's actually my flair over at /r/SquaredCircle)

I actually really liked Angra's song where they use Fabio in a decent role, like the first two tracks and ""Perfect Symmetry"". My issue is that there are too many guest vocalists, and too many of the songs have Fabio singing in a really strange low register that doesn't even sound like him. I still liked the album a bit, but not enough for it to make any kind of lists this year."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","I wonder if that Thulnar record is about Magic: the Gathering"

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","[deleted]"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","Can someone explain the lack of Angra hype? It's not a life-changing album or anything but it's decent and I honestly thought /r/powermetal would be up in arms over it.

Oooh new Orden Ogan and Alpha Tiger!!"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","Can you really hype an album that's already come out though? I think the hype will always be greater for an album that's about to come out."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","From announcement to now it seems to have wholeheartedly flown under the radar. I expected much more buzz"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)","It had a really bad release date. It went out in Japan before the New Year causing it to clash with all the end of year stuff. "

"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","*Song by Song Impressions*:


**Ninth Wave:** This song contains the best album intro I have ever heard. Its epic in scope, but ominous. It doesn't just sound great - it does a fantastic job of setting up the atmosphere for the album and the story. As the additional elements come in, it feels like a twisted puzzle coming into place. Hansi + the layered vocals is just chilling. After the intro comes a rather unconventional song structure. The guitars and percussion maintains a strong backbone, but the vocal melodies feel like they're in some sort of soup, being pulled out as needed. It all continues the dark tone set up by the intro - and then 'LET THIS FIRE BURN!' followed by a wonderful, if rather standard Blind Guardian chorus. All of this combined with some new instrumentation for the band took a couple listens to fully take in, but I think the band managed to make something both a pleasure to listen to as well as being entirely unique. 

**Twilight of the Gods:** It was our song of the year for 2014, and well deserved imo. This is one of the more standard Blind Guardian tracks on the album, but it nevertheless still brings something new to the table. It starts off with a very speed/power metal-esque intro, reminiscent of the band's Somewhere Far Beyond album, then Hansi comes in screaming as the band kicks into the main riffs for the song. While being much more traditional in song structure compared to much of the album, the band still plays around a bit with the verse-chorus structure and the pre-chorus intro/outro sections are powerful additions to this song.

**Prophecies:** 'How much was the band listening to Uriah Heep while writing this album?' is a question I find myself often asking when listening to this album, and this song is a fine example of this. The band talked about this one being left over from the writing for At the Edge of Time, and I can definitely hear a sense of 'Control the Divine' in it as well. Apart from the influences, I have to say I really enjoy the layered vocals on this one - more than usual! This is also the first of two songs that feel like they're building up to something, and then end with a magnificent conclusion!

**At The Edge of Time:** Oh my. This is the symphonic masterpiece of the album, as well as being the second of the two songs to primarily be built around the climb up to an explosive conclusion. First things first, the percussion is a little too basic on this song for my liking - I get the sense that the band want the timing, and then for the drums to allow everything else to shine. And gods does everything else shine. The two symphonic songs on the last album (also titled 'At the Edge of Time!') showed a level of mastery in integrating the metal band with the classical orchestras and choirs that few such bands have achieved, and Blind Guardian has upped their game. The band and the orchestra take turns to shine, but more importantly have more frequent interaction that complements both equally, and the more subtle elements of the orchestra are taken advantage of as much as the bombastic. Hansi takes the opportunity to try a more operatic approach to his vocals, though not extremely so, and all this combines into an excellent whole. The conclusion of the song is easily among the album's best moments.

**Ashes of Eternity:** Thus far, this has proven to be my favorite song on the album. It is another more traditional song structure-wise, but also continues to experiment with vocal melodies and Hansi's own style, which has some unique combination of 'fullness' and 'harshness' that's not quite like anything else he's done. The backing vocals really shine on this song, and Hansi does a great job of integrating them with his own main melodies. I haven't talked about solos yet, but I think André's performance here is worth a highlight, though the riffing throughout the song is really the standout aspect of the guitars. Once again, Uriah Heep influence deserve a mention. Also that 'Caesar!' ...holy shit.

**Distant Memories:** This song has quite a unique intro for the band, but the orchestration is the real star of this ballad. It continues to demonstrate the excellent integration between the band and the symphony that the songwriting has achieved. Hansi takes a soothing and soaring approach which works very well with the song. The melody following the solo is the high point of this song for me - it's quite a powerful bit amidst a more gentle song.

**The Holy Grail:** Here's how I described it when this song leaked: ""It's everything I want in my power metal cereal: aggressive, intricate, catchy, new sounds, and Hansi...!"" This is basically classic speed metal Guardian combined with some influence from their newer, more progressive approach. The result is a song with both aggressive catchiness and songwriting depth. The chorus on this one is probably my favorite of the album - I could see this one being a crowd favorite, for sure. 

**The Throne:** This one might be described as 'At the Edge of Time' combined with a more traditional structure. The strings take more of a leading role for the orchestration, though the brass section coming in strong around 'We will not surrender' is another very powerful moment on the album. Like 'At the Edge of Time,' Hansi takes a more operatic approach, and this song feels like the one where the story of the album plays in the strongest, especially regarding its combination with the music. All in all, it's a very dramatic song, and every element makes the most of that.

**Sacred Mind:** This is easily the harshest song on the album. Pounding drums and aggressive riffs do a lot - but Hansi's killer vocal performance is really the star of this song. The bridge between the intro and the song proper, along with the conclusion of the song, are great examples of this. Once the song gets going, it maintains a high level of energy, helped out by a rather catchy chorus.

**Miracle Machine:** A short and sweet ballad. Hansi talked about wanting something calm before the big epic, and the song accomplishes that well. I'd describe it as 'The Eldar' redone with some Demons &amp; Wizards vocals and strings. It's a safer song for the band, but it has a nice touch.

**Grand Parade:** Here it is - the big finisher! What a song this is - it's like a sinusoid of orchestral metal, constantly oscillating between loud and soft moments. It brings everything the band has, and Hansi especially has a lot cut out for him on this one. He brings his ballad voice, the big choruses, as well as some harsher moments. The tone of the song is an uplifting song unlike anything the band has done before. A good ways into the song, it starts building up - more like the latter part of The Throne than like Ashes of Eternity - and some nice brass touches complement Hansi's vocal lines excellently. The chorus of the song is one of the strongest on the album.

**Doom:** What's this - more?! If you got the Earbook edition, yes! This is easily the most experimental song on a rather experimental album. You could also exchange 'experimental' for 'dark' there. Hansi and the guitars sound absolutely evil on this one - it reminds me quite a bit of 'Dead Sound of Misery.' The catchiness of the song suffers a bit as a result, and it's probably the weakest of the bunch. Nevertheless, the song has its excellent moments too.
"
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","(Continued from above due to word limit)

*Story:* With the songs not being terribly explicit regarding the narrative, and not much expository material included (the Earbook has a bit more), the story is definitely one that's open to a quite a bit of interpretation. Here's my understanding of it, though: there were once two realms: ours and a fantastical realm called Camlann. Camlann, also known as the 'Promised Land,' was ruled by nine beings referred to as gods, though they were mortals. Some of these were the Crow, Hare, Fox, Bear, and Falcon. There are other divine beings such as Time, Space, Fire, Fear, and Void. Mordred, the Fallen One, is the son of one of these beings. Mordred wages war on the Nine, which causes them to reach out to our world. A boy named Arthur, who shares the same name as the Bear, encounters a mirror which is a bridge to this other realm where he is the Chosen One. He is meant to leap through, but instead declines. This causes magic to leak out of Camlann into our world, where a scientist named Harry Oppenheimer discovers how to use it. Within two decades, technocrats forge one world government with one religion, and begin reviving mystical creatures. Time travel is used to manipulate historical events. Mordred continues his quest to wipe out the gods who soon depart or disappear from Camlann, renamed Discordia. The story of the album occurs as Arthur learns of Mordred's attack, and he is called to Discordia. He must pass through the only remaining gateway: the Red Mirror. However, he is killed, and only saved by Mother Time. He is led to the Holy Grail, which is a key in defeating Mordred. War is waged on Mordred, who still believes his aim is pure, and Arthur is tempted to give up his quest. Finally, in the end, the gods are made powerless, and Arthur and Mordred are trapped outside both realms. The two worlds are both still in a state of chaos, but have been left to recover on their own, and all the gateways between them are sealed. This could largely be wrong, though, given the ambiguity of the material.

*Production:* This has received a lot of criticism, and I hate to say it, but it's very well deserved criticism. Frankly, Blind Guardian probably has among the worst engineering for a band with their resources, which is unfortunate given how good the songwriting is. The orchestral tracks suffered the worst - the symphonies often sound distorted and muted, and that sometimes even affects the guitars. The cymbals are often too loud in the mix - they seem to even be at the forefront of 'At the Edge of Time,' to the point of making it difficult to fully enjoy all the intricate orchestration going on. A few notable audio glitches also sneaked in - the worst is on 'The Throne.' It's frankly surprising that something as bad as that one got in the final mix. Some of the songs do sound good though - to the point that it can feel like there were very different engineering teams working on a few of these. All in all though, this is almost a return to A Twist in the Myth's level of bad production.

Overview: Production aside, this is a stellar, though not flawless, album. Ultimately, I see this album as continuing band's march into more progressive songwriting, and even more so mastering the band's integration with symphonic elements. I feel that this plays the role of 'rock opera' much better than Nightfall in Middle-earth, which does not have as strong of a self-contained narrative. While the story can be difficult to decipher, I do feel that it contributes positively to the songwriting and the emotional depth of the music. Hansi sounds great as usual on this album, and I don't think there's a Blind Guardian album where he has quite as much variance in style from song-to-song."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","It really is unfortunate about the production, especially with the drumming. Like, listen to the chorus of The Holy Grail....it almost sounds like Frederik isn't even playing the bass drums and is just hitting the cymbal. I agree the album is still great but it's almost unacceptable for a record in 2015 to sound like this."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","Y'know, people talk about The Holy Grail being a great song, and I just... don't care for it.  Excluding Doom, I believe it to easily be the weakest song."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","*Even with that beautiful chorus?!*

Nah, just kidding... sort of.

If the song doesn't appeal to you, that's just the way it is. This is especially true in a more energy-driven song like The Holy Grail, where if that energy isn't there for you, there's not going to be much else than can appeal to you."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","I can definitely do energy driven, I just find the melody structure of The Holy Grail not appealing to me, especially compared to the catchiness and intricacy of the rest of the album."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","My first listen through had me thinking, ""oh boy, this is not living up to hype..."".

My second listen through had me thinking, ""hmm, this is pretty good actually, I can get into this - lots of little things to pick up here and there, and quite a lot going on"".

My third listen through, ""damn, this album is amazing, definitely got into this - the only stopping this album from being perfect is the production!"".

Favorite songs are Ninth Wave, Twilight of the Gods, Distant Memories, and The Throne.  I love the others, but I figure listing the majority of songs as favorites is a little strange.

Ninth Wave has the best intro I have ever heard, and the parts where Hansi does aggressive, quick-shouting vocals (especially the second, longer one) are absolutely amazing.

Twilight of the Gods has some of the catchiest vocal melodies going on that I have heard in awhile.  The more I listen to the chorus, the more I understand what Blind Guardian meant about how catchy it is.  I love that about this album - instead of the more you listen to it, the more boring and old it gets; it is the more you listen to it, the more interesting and catchy it gets.

Distant Memories is a song that requires the listener to pay very close attention.  It is an incredibly intricate song in a very subtle way - and by Jesus, that chorus is magical.

The Throne?  All you need is ""I've come to tell 'yaaaaaa once more!"",  mmf.

As I continue to listen, I am sure my favorites will change.  I have not been able to get into The Holy Grail (especially this one) and Grand Parade as much as the next person.

In regards to future official album discussions, the only thing I'd suggest is reminding people to sort comments via new to continue discussion and keep it moving forward."

"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","That opening to Distant Memories -  I need more of that. 

Incredible! "
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","The chorus of Distant Memories - I need more of that."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","If the world was being saved from the brink of destruction, and there was a song playing in the background, it would be The Throne."

"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","[deleted]"
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","I got scared on my first listen because the album starts out with one of the most boring songs BG have ever written, which is a shame, because it starts off with a really cool intro and then just plods on for 7 minutes. Thankfully after that it returns to the standard BG fair.  

For me this is a run of the mill BG album(which is still pretty damn good) but for me, its a step down from the last album and isn't close to 90's Guardian.  I'm assuming the people saying this is the best BG album or that ""they never really got BG until this album"" haven't experienced a Blind Guardian release before and just got caught up in the hype.  

The three standout tracks for me are At the Edge of Time, Grand Parade and The Holy Grail.   "
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","&gt;  I'm assuming the people saying this is the best BG album or that ""they never really got BG until this album"" haven't experienced a Blind Guardian release before and just got caught up in the hype. 

I don't think that's fair. There's nothing else quite like it in Blind Guardian's discography, and not everyone shares your tastes. For one thing, one of my friends says that this is the first time they can appreciate Hansi's vocals for certain songs."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","I think this album is amazing and easily one of the better works coming out from Blind Guardian. Yes, the production is a bit flat. Yes, it's a bit too long. However, thematically and musically I think this is full of great ideas and nearly all of them are executed properly and harmoniously.

If you want my honest opinion, the weaker tracks are the opener and the closer. All the parts that compose The Ninth Wave are actually very good if you individualize each of them but, together... I think they aren't very well glued together and suffers in the long run, same thing for The Grand Parade, goes great for the 5 or 6 initial minutes but then the final part (again, very well done), just doesn't really merge well with the other part of the song.

All in all, This is easily one of the better albums in 2015 already. I'm just sad it's not a return to the Blind Guardian's formula of speed metal."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","&gt; I'm just sad it's not a return to the Blind Guardian's formula of speed metal.

There are a couple fairly speedy tracks on it, though (The Holy Grail and Sacred Mind). If you're looking for something like late 80s or early 90s Guardian, I think it just needs to be accepted that that isn't going to happen. The band has evolved, and they aren't interested in just writing another speed metal album."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","I fully acknowledge they won't ever release an album akin to their early work. I only wanted more speed and less pompous stuff.

Honestly, if there ever was a band that had to evolve into a more symphonic style, I'm glad it was Blind Guardian because they do have the chops to pull off grandiose orchestrated metal."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","This is the sound they've been developing since A Night at the Opera...So...is Beyond the Red Mirror a good album? Absolutely.  Is it a great album? Maybe.  I'd rate it near equal or maybe above At the Edge of Time.  
  
The good: High quality symphonic elements, typical excellent intros, great vocals from hansi
  
The bad: iffy production, a little too heavy on slow meandering segments, needs more riffs, not every song ever needs 80 layers of vocals
  


Heavy on the symphonic elements, many of the songs on Beyond the Red Mirror tend to meander rather than follow the formula that made Blind Guardian so famous.  Hooks, melodies and choruses that are second to none.  It's no surprise that Holy Grail is so highly regarded because it is by far the tightest song on the album (and IMO it's a song destined to become a fan favorite at concerts).  
  
  
  
Track highlights:

Ninth Wave - The only non-classic Track One they've ever released.  Possibly my least favorite song on the album.  
  
Twilight of the Gods - This track goes all over the place but it's grown on me.  I don't know why they bothered releasing it as the single since it's not especially catchy.  A 7/10 if I've ever heard one.  
  
At the Edge of Time - The first track on the album that really sold me on the album that Blind Guardian still has it.  
  
Holy Grail - If they released an album of Holy Grails people would probably consider Blind Guardian the best power metal band of all time.  Oh wait, they've done that.  Classic BG fare.

Sacred Mind - My wife's favorite song from the album.  Catchy chorus and not too long winded.
  
Miracle Machine - This albums' Black Chamber/The Eldar that is a bit odd and only 8 people will actually enjoy it.  Hansi almost sounds like he isn't up to the task of singing the song, it's very jarring since for the rest of the album, he's still got it.  
  
The Grand Parade - Ninth Wave hears this song and goes and cowers in the corner or something.
  
  

"
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","&gt;I don't know why they bothered releasing it as the single since it's not especially catchy. 

Plenty of people do think it's quite catchy, though..."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","Speaking generally and briefly:

* The band seemed to get its teeth stuck into orchestration with At The Edge of Time and this album feels like they're indulging in another hit (so if you came because you love some speed metal you're going to be left underfed). It feels like a continuation of that and while very impressive for the most part I get the feeling it doesn't quite live up to the symphonic compositions of the previous album.
* I genuinely think Hansi sounds better on this album. It's a feature of his unique vocals that he can use a hoarse-screeching sound (see Wheel of Time) characteristic of his earlier work which seems downplayed on this album in favour of a fuller voice, confident in hitting the higher range consistently and cleanly.
* It's a concept album which means it's less schizophrenic in themes than the last album and while I think this means it suffers a tiny bit in lack of experimentation I do think each track gives enough variety that a listen-through doesn't blur into one.
* I can't comment much on narrative but I love that Sacred Mind references Kubla Khan by Coleridge.
* The token ballad, Miracle Machine, is beautiful.
* The grand finale is epic but for my money does not unseat Wheel of Time or And Then There Was Silence but it is, on its own merits, magnificent nonetheless. 
* I don't really understand the criticism on production. While something does seem lacking in comparison I don't think it's awful and neither do I find it distracting enough to warrant mention. But \*shrug* I'm no audiophile and I don't have the best, most expensive setup. "
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","&gt; I can't comment much on narrative but I love that Sacred Mind references Kubla Khan by Coleridge.

There are a lot of great references on this album. The Arthuring Cycle gets a lot of mentions (Arthur, Mordred, Camlann, the Holy Grail, etc.) Greek and Norse mythology also come into it, and there's even a lot of connections to Blind Guardian's discography, particularly Imaginations from the Other Side, A Night at the Opera, and A Twist in the Myth."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","Overall, I thoroughly enjoy this album, although it took a few listens to get into it.

Track overviews:

The Ninth Wave:
This was my least favourite song when I first listened to it, since the instrumentation and vocals outside of the chorus seem muddled and hard to piece together. Now I've taken some time to listen to it more carefully, I have a much better appreciation for it.
The orchestration seems very strong on this track, especially the epic choirs in the first and last few minutes of the track.
Highlights of this track are the suitably epic intro and outro, the nice strong chorus and the amazing first verse - I especially enjoy the slower, darker section beginning at 2:29.

Twilight of the Gods:
First song I heard on the album, I thoroughly enjoy the whole thing, and there isn't much for me to say that hasn't been said already. Great song all round.
The chorus is good, and I enjoy the riff that comes after the chorus a lot.

Prophecies:
This seems a very solid track, a little softer than the previous two in my opinion. I haven't listened to it as much as I would like yet, but one thing that does stand out is the superb chorus.

At the Edge of Time:
Probably my favourite track on the album, I enjoy every element of this track, although at times the orchestration seems to drown out the percussion and guitars (noticeably in the chorus).
Having said that, the orchestration is very good (I especially like the short but atmospheric intro with the bells).
This track seems to simply build up and up continuously, releasing more epic melodies (""grant me wings to fly..."") and slowly building up the heaviness of the rhythm guitars and percussion until a slight release in tension just before the chorus, then exploding into one of the most epic choruses on the album, accompanied by some brilliant brass.
Highlights are the build-up to the first chorus, the chorus, and the various orchestration throughout the track.

Ashes of Eternity:
The song I've listened to the least on the album so far, there seems to be a lot of good things here though, but nothing truly amazing. I'm do like,however, how the faster thrash/speed metal kinda sound of the intro/verse works well in contrast to the slower and lighter chorus.

Distant Memories:
Been listening to this a lot recently, one of my favourites. I love the intro, especially how some of the melodies work with the percussion. The chorus is one of the strongest on the album I feel, one of my favourite BG ones overall.

Holy Grail:
Less orchestration here, and a much heavier sound. I much prefer the guitars on this track to Ashes of Eternity, although the vocals in the chorus can be quite lackluster at times (save for the woahs and the bit directly before the chorus). The chorus itself, however, like Distant memories, is one of the best on the album. Great stuff.

The Throne:
Will give this a few more listens at some point. I enjoy this track, it has a very strong chorus (Determination... Determination... Determination!) and the verse is also quite epic and dramatic, but not as much as the first verse of either The Ninth Wave or At The Edge of Time. The variation in the verses seems to be quite refreshing though (the second verse especially is slower at the start and very good).

Sacred Mind:
This track is another one of my favourites. The instrumentation is heavier in the intro and later, yet it contrasts with softer and more mournful vocals from Hansi at the start of the verse, but is then reinforced by stronger and harsher vocals in the second half. Overall, good guitar work, and the Chorus is very good, the layered vocals work well here.

Miracle Machine:
The ballad is good, great chorus, shame it is so short!

Grand Parade:
I haven't listened to this much yet, so won't comment in full yet, but the chorus seems very good - and very lengthy!

Doom:
Minimal listens, will add more later.


Overall:
I haven't been bothered by the production. I feel this is a very strong album, but also very different. It has a quite unique feel.

Will add a post about my interpretations of the lyrics at a later date."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","This is one of the few albums I listened to repeatedly when it came out (four times in a week, which is unheard of for me). And yeah, it needed multiple listens to fully take in what was there.

This is solely because on my **first listen**, it felt thick as mud, and that's exactly why I DON'T like A Night At the Opera. (you can argue me later on that fact, just not here, stick to the topic). But as always, it had catchy choruses and some great hooks. Somethings I caught on first listen was the Kubla Khan reference, but I know it better as Xanadu by Rush (having heard that album no more than a month ago). I also felt that The Ninth Wave was Sacred Worlds mach 2. Much like how Black Sabbath's albums Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules had similar songs (Neon Knights/Turn Up the Night, Heaven and Hell/Sign of the Southern Cross) this is how I felt about Ninth Wave. Not a bad thing at all, I like when it sounds similar, yet different.

**Second listen**, the album was a new experience. The songs started sounding much different and had their own sound. I know what Holy Grail sounds like compared to Sacred Minds, along with Ninth Wave to Grand Parade. (still can't get over how Distant Memories starts, feels like a B-Side with its intro) I even started digging the story that there's only one mirror left (the Red one if you can believe that...) and how it needs to be found. And good news, it didn't sound like it was as thick as mud this time, which is always a plus.

The **third listen** worried me, because I told my friends ""this needs to be listened to"" and it was their first time hearing it. Sadly, to them it was ""it's good, I'll check it out"" compared to the ""Holy Shit! This kicked me in the dickhole!"" response I was hoping for (yes, my circle of friends do actually say that)

**Fourth listen** was probably a little less enjoyable, since I knew everything that was coming, but it still felt like an enjoyable listen. As for all these ""production is iffy"" comments, I have it at 320 kbps and through nice headphones, so it sounded awesome to me (minus the third time which was just played through the ipod)

My biggest problem though is where do I rank it on my list of Blind Guardian albums? My list looks different from most because I enjoy the speedy Guardian stuff as much as the later material. But overall, this was **4th** (out of 10) on my list of best to worst BG albums.

**Best Songs:** Sacred Minds, Miracle Machine, Twilight of the Gods, At the Edge of Time

**Overall Rating:** 4.5/5. This is because I gave it multiple listens. It would have been a 3.5 or a 4 otherwise.

**Sidenote:** Has anyone listened to the bonus track Doom? Is it worthwhile or skippable? I ask because I got the Digi-Pak and didn't feel the need to spend more on an extra track."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","&gt;As for all these ""production is iffy"" comments, I have it at 320 kbps and through nice headphones, so it sounded awesome to me (minus the third time which was just played through the ipod)

Listening on CD quality and on a variety of platforms: low quality speakers, high quality speakers, low quality headphones, and high quality headphones. The production isn't good.

&gt;Has anyone listened to the bonus track Doom? Is it worthwhile or skippable?

It's an experimental track for the band that doesn't quite work out well, similar to 'Dead Sound of Misery'. It's the weakest of the songs. If you don't need to hear everything the band comes out with, I'd say it's skippable."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","I like Dead Sound of Misery :("
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","I must be the only one who didn't care for the production then. I've heard much worse and this album was far from the worst."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","It's more like we should expect better from Blind Guardian of all bands.  They very obviously care about their craft and have the resources and connections to record an album with no production issues.  Somewhere Far Beyond might sound like it was recorded in a cave on a tape recorder, but at least it was consistent across the board; Beyond the Red Mirror is all over the place."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","After a few listens I've begun to really enjoy this album. However the production is terrible, and has definitely made it harder to appreciate it. Vocals are fine, but the guitars and drums are very poorly mixed.so far my favourite song is the holy grail, which is probably one of the songs that suffers the least from the production issues. Despite this,it's still probably my favourite Blind Guardian album since Nightfall"
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","I agree that the production could be better, but it's definitely not terrible.  You **need** to listen to this on big speakers that can can really let loose and build the proper sound stage for you. 

There is just so much layering that if you try to listen to this album on small speakers, like headphones or even most car stereos, you won't come anywhere close to the sound that Blind Guardian intended. "
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","If anything, listening to music on an excellent pair of headphones is one of the BEST ways to experience music. This album falls a little flat at times, unfortunately."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","That's not really a convincing argument, because even if it's true, most people  aren't to be able to do that, so the production is going to be a problem for them. An album should sound good on headphones, if it doesn't that's an issue"
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","You can't make a song sound perfect on tiny speakers **and** big speakers. They're just too vastly different. When it comes to fine-tuning an exact sound, a band has to bear in mind what their music is going to be played on. And a grand sound like Blind Guardian's -  I think they made the right choice. "
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","Bullshit. Small flat response speakers/drivers and large flat response speakers have largely the same response. You know. Flat. 

Now obviously there is going to be some difference, particularly in how the bass responds. But a mix that sounds bad through reasonable quality flat response headphones, 99% of the time, is a bad mix."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","I've listened to the album on low quality speakers, high quality speakers, low quality headphones, and high quality headphones. Speakers and headphones don't really make a difference in my experience, aside from speakers better masking the audio glitches. If a mix is done badly, that's going to be reflected in all mediums."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","I am not going to pretend like I understand how this shit works, however listening to things on high quality speakers or headphones is obviously better, and this is VERY apparent on this album.  Things will become muddled quickly with shitty audio."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","still muddled with quality headphones though

edit: forgot how to english"
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","That techno percussion on Ninth Wave is really weird. Miracle Machine is quite the tearjerker. Grand Parade is an epic ending. I keep getting little snippets of melody stuck in my head hours later."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","Still trying to digest this album.  I get the feeling this is the sound they were aiming for with A Twist in the Myth.  I'm liking it more and more each time I hear it.  

My favorite track is Holy Grail - Very accessible, and it covers all of the various styles of BG through the years.

Least favorite right now is Miracle Machine.  It is a very nice ballad, but it seems lacking to me.  I kept waiting for the song to kick into a heavier gear for a little bit, but it never happened."
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","I had a very similar feeling when I first listened - I felt it would have been pretty great had some guitars kicked in around halfway through and we got a heavier chorus second time round, but I must say I still enjoy it as it is.

The chorus is indeed very good after all. "
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","At the Edge of Time and Sacred Mind are my two favorites!"
"Official Album Discussion: Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror","I'm a bit late here, but:

I went into this album with a closed mind. I'm not the biggest fan of their work after Imaginations, but I figured this will be a reliable release with at least a few good tracks.

Needless to say, I was really blown away. On first listen, I had no idea what was going on. The verses on this album are incredibly progressive, and each song feels like a huge journey. After more listens, the structures of the songs became clearer, and it was easy to pick out favourites. The Ninth Wave is probably the best song here because it's chorus is incredibly catchy. With that said, I actually find Twilight of the Gods to be stuck in my head most often.

Prophecies is the song I feel like nobody is talking about, but it is easily one of the best. In fact, this song probably has my favourite performance of Hansi's on the record.

I don't enjoy the next two tracks as much. They feel more symphonic (which is fine), but they just aren't catchy. Luckily, The Holy Grail immediately redeems those two. Same thing with the two tracks after.

Miracle Machine is a pretty good ballad. I feel like its placement is perfect on the album, and that makes it more effective. Grand Parade is pretty much the definition of epic and an appropriate conclusion to the album.

Overall, I was really impressed and will be returning to this often. I can't tell what's coming for the rest of the year, but this is a serious contender to be my top album of the year."

"Fazermint's favorite releases: January","###Fazermint's favorite Power Metal releases: January  
Fellow warriors, I present to you my newest /r/PowerMetal project: Talking about my favorite releases of the past month!

You know me, I like making playlists. So, naturally, I've decided to maintain a playlist of all my favorite releases on the Power Metal scene. I'll be doing this for the entirety of 2015. Hot damn!

It's not a Fazermint post if I don't provide my own ultra-biased opinions. So you can find those below. Hot diggity!

I'll even talk about a select few non-PM releases that I'm excited about, because... well, because I can! So let's get to it!

*****  
###Release highlights  

[Playlist: Power Metal 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE1FmEyuepxiO3TkjfULAm-t3qw2Dh9cl)

* **Angra**: *Secret Garden* - [Newborn Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wIqIRK5ynM) (Progressive Power Metal)

* **Blind Guardian**: *Beyond the Red Mirror* - [Twilight of the Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep1B_aIFPDE) (Power Metal)  

*****  
###Fazermint's ultra-biased opinions

* **Angra**: Angra is posted frequently here on /r/PowerMetal, and is a top-tier PM band for many of us. I'm not very familiar with their stuff, but *Secret Garden* sounds like a quality outing. Angra is now fronted by Fabio Lione, the fabulous lion, who you know from Rhapsody of Fire among other things. Some of you may be sick of the guy, because he's *everywhere*. Well, not me! The lead single, ""Newborn Me"" is pretty awesome, showcasing that Fabio and progressive PM go well together. Great riffs throughout the song, great chorus, awesome acoustic guitar segment and kick-ass solo right after.  
* **Orden Ogan**: I've recently fallen in love with Orden Ogan. ""The Things we Believe In"" and ""To the End"" are my go-to tracks right now. To hear that theres's a new release was a pleasant surprise. ""F.E.V.E.R"" sounds really good, with powerful and catchy vocals, great chorus, superb instrumentation with kick-ass guitars and some violins here and there (at least I think they are violins...?)  
* **Serious Black**: Oh, hell yes! This is definitely my favorite song of the month. Serious Black is kind of a supergroup, but not really - they consider themselves a regular band, the fact that it is comprised of some serious starpower besides. We've got Urban Breed on vocals, Roland Grapow on guitars, and other well-established musicians. Grapow's influence is noticeable, as ""Mystic Mind"" sounds like it could have been a Masterplan song off the Aeronautics album. The melodic intro is awesome, and I can actually identify with the lyrics. Really really great, song of the month for me.  
* **Vexillum**: I'm happy to expand my library of Power Folk, now Elvenking won't be so alone. I really like ""Over the Clouds"". Chris Bay provides vocals on this one, and he has been criticized. I can understand the criticisms, but it's not that bad. The melody is folky and catchy, and the vocals are as well. This song just puts a smile on my face. The folk instruments are well executed, and the guitar solo kills! The rest of the album sees guest musicians such as Hansi Kürch and Mark Boals. It's a pretty high-end production. 
* **Visigoth**: Most surprising release of the month? It just might be. The album is promoted with the song [Dungeon Master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oclDVweTR4). The instrumentation is nice and fast, and the guitars kick some serious ass! The vocalist is damn good, but I didn't like the vocals in this particular song. I was certainly intrigued, though, and dug further. I found the song ""Creature of Desire"" off their EP, which kicks way more ass. I uploaded the slightly remastered version of this song off the new album, *just for you, sexy bastards*.  
* **Blind Guardian**: So yeah. I'm not a Blind Guardian fanboy. But holy schmuck, ""Twilight of the Gods"" is one magnificent track. It's the only Blind Guardian song I have really cared about, which is weird because I'm told it's fairly standard BG stuff. Subjectivity is fascinating. There's just something else about this track. I guess it's closer to my own personal notion of power metal, or something. It kicks so much ass.  

*****  
###Non-PM spotlight  
Just some random non-PM releases I'm excited about:

* **Dracula**: *Swing of Death* - [Walking on Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9Gme_E8ZWk) (Hard Rock). This is the concept album collaboration of metal king Jørn Lande (Jorn) and guitarist/songwriter Trond Holter. Holter has worked with Jorn on his latest solo records, but is best known as the guitarist/songwriter of the Glam Rock band Wig Wam. [Holter rockin' it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US5NedSGPcA). As for the actual release, it's not really reminiscent of anything Jorn has done before. It's less heavy, there's a general influence of classical music, and some songs are duets with female vocalist Lena Fløitmoen. Holter's guitar solos are pretty smooth, generally less speed-oriented than you folks probably prefer. It's a pretty enjoyable album, but it's different than Jorn's usual stuff.  
* **Level 10**: *Chapter 1* - [Cry no More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02NNqNocpY0) (Heavy Metal). Allen &amp; Lande may not be doing a release together, but they've both got a new release out this month. Level 10 is another new collaboration, this time between Russel Allen (Symphony X) and Mat Sinner (Primal Fear). This is a regular Heavy Metal album, and most of the tracks have a slight touch of soul music. Allen has a powerhouse of a voice, and the instrumentation is well done. I skimmed through it and it seems pretty decent, but also nothing to get all tingly about.

"Fazermint's favorite releases: January","&gt; We've got Urban Breed on vocals, Roland Grapow on guitars, and other well-established musicians.

No mention of Thomen Stauch? I am saddened, but you did say you weren't a big Blind Guardian fan, so I understand.

Nice to see an opinion like this though, seeing what has come out and whatnot for the month."
"Fazermint's favorite releases: January","Yeah, these were the only two names I knew. figured I could either list the whole lineup or just mention a couple... went with the latter because I'm lazy. :P

Glad you like it, I'm thinking of doing a revised post later (see my reply to MadTheMad). Anything you'd like to see?"
"Fazermint's favorite releases: January","Maybe a rating of some kind (keep it simple, like out of 5, don't need you to think too hard now) for each album, or someway of saying ""Yes!"" or ""No!"" for what to listen to. Otherwise, I' mnot sure what else needs improvement."

"Fazermint's favorite releases: January","When i read the title , I thought you were targeting the albums and not just one song. Out of the 6 albums, which one did you though was the better? ^^It ^^better ^^be ^^Angra ^^^^or ^^^^else"
"Fazermint's favorite releases: January","I first wanted to do that, but then this post would end up being delayed till like late February. Simply haven't had the time to listen to everything yet. Can't even tell you which album is my favorite. :/

I aimed for more of a reminder of the good stuff that has come out this month. I can try and give it a bigger emphasis on albums next time, but it'd still be on a surface level.

Edit: Hell, maybe I'll make a revised version in a week or so, using the approach of my DPM series (as in multiple songs per album being possible, I don't think I want to write walls of text here). Sound good?"
"Fazermint's favorite releases: January","Sounds awesome. Best of lucks in your writings."
"Fazermint's favorite releases: January","This is an excellent idea, I'll be looking forward to timely releases of all these posts monthly. You best not be late or I'll Hulk smash!

I was initially unimpressed with **Angra** but I may be coming around. Further listens were much better than my initial impressions. You need to look into their other albums, Angra is something special. They really ought to have a spot in the sidebar.

[I am Rome and the year is AD 410](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_%28410%29). **Visigoth** shattered the gates of my life and sacked me with awesome power. And I thanked them for it!

Reading your description of **Level 10** had me ramped up for something great. Only to be brought down hard, I found it really disappointing honestly. I expected so much more."

 [**Sack of Rome (410)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack%20of%20Rome%20%28410%29): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;The __[Sack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting) of [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome)__ occurred on August 24, 410. The city was attacked by the [Visigoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths), led by [Alaric I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_I). At that time, Rome was no longer the capital of the [Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire), having been replaced in this position by [Ravenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenna) in 402. Nevertheless, the city of Rome retained a paramount position as ""the eternal city"" and a spiritual center of the Empire. The sack was a major shock to contemporaries, friends and foes of the Empire alike.

&gt;This was the first time in almost 800 years that Rome had fallen to a foreign enemy. The previous [sack of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Allia) had been accomplished by the [Gauls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul) under their leader [Brennus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brennus_(4th_century\)) in 387 BC. The sacking of 410 is seen as a major landmark in the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire). [St. Jerome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jerome), living in Bethlehem at the time, wrote that ""The City which had taken the whole world was itself taken.""

"Would people be interested in an Iron Savior guide/writeup?","Iron Savior is one of my favorite bands and I like to think I'm pretty knowledgeable about their music. I could write about an individual album or shorter sections about all of them and Iron Savior's career in general.

Edit: I would analyze their music, it wouldn't just read like a wiki article."
"Would people be interested in an Iron Savior guide/writeup?","Just something to think about, but I'm not a huge fan of the ""Guide to _____"" that gives a biographical explanation of the band. To me, I could just read their wikipedia page and read around a little bit more.

What I'm interested in, for a ""Guide To"" topic would be recommendations of what songs to listen to, explanation of the techniques and lyrical content and other information which would help me get into the band. After I read a ""guide"" topic, I should want to listen to the *music* because it's been hyped up so much :D To me, it's not particularly helpful to have a ""history of ____"" topic, unless it's called that! I would think a ""guide to"" should teach me what to expect with the music, which should obviously intertwine with the history a bit (lineup changes etc)

"Would people be interested in an Iron Savior guide/writeup?","I don't think there's a list anywhere. Since they dropped the full album stories, there's been one or two songs on each album that tell a little bit. I'd be glad to add a list to my writeup."

Regarding Iron Savior specifically, I was actually kind of interested after listening to some stuff off their most recent album, which I heard wasn't that great. So I'd love to  learn more about some of their ""better"" stuff, for sure. 

I think something touching on all their albums would be best. If you'd like an example, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1dmxof/a_beginners_guide_to_coheed_cambria/) is one of the best guides to a band I've seen (Not PM though). "

"Thought experiment: What if Michael Jackson had sung power metal?","I have a recurring train of thought that goes something like this:

I lament/wonder about the general (though not complete) dearth of black people in heavy metal, especially given that perhaps the most important guitarist in establishing the genre was black. I think how it'd be sort of interesting (if tokenist) if a power-metal band had a black frontman, Killswitch Engage style. I think, well, at least stereotypically, I think of black male singing voices as being more often bass and baritone than typical power-metal tenor. And then I remember Michael Jackson, probably the most famous tenor/countertenor in all of popular music. And I wonder...

How would Jackson's voice have translated to a power-metal band? He sung high enough, for sure, and he had the energy... Would it have worked? Totally a random thought process, but it intrigued me enough to want others' opinions.

(Also, I think someone really needs to do a power-metal cover of ""Thriller."")"
"Thought experiment: What if Michael Jackson had sung power metal?","I can picture a piano-heavy Jackson power metal ballad"
"Thought experiment: What if Michael Jackson had sung power metal?","I am imagining The Trooper chorus being sung with all ""hee heees"" instead of ""ooooh ooooohs.""  "
"Thought experiment: What if Michael Jackson had sung power metal?","Oh God that's funny :D"
"Thought experiment: What if Michael Jackson had sung power metal?","Independent of his ability to fit into the vocal stylings of the genre, Michael Jackson certainly would have made some incredible, world-class music videos with power metal imagery.

I feel like his ability to dance would have been wasted, though."
"Thought experiment: What if Michael Jackson had sung power metal?","Are there any black folks in power metal at all? I can think of bands that have black guys for every other subgenre of metal, but I'm at a complete loss for power metal."
"Thought experiment: What if Michael Jackson had sung power metal?","Maybe in one of the smaller Brazilian bands... ?"

"THE LION KING - BE PREPARED (Metal Cover)","I thought if there was a single time I might be able to appreciate Pellek's voice it would actually be for this.....yea that was a mistake."
"THE LION KING - BE PREPARED (Metal Cover)","He fucking nailed it!!!"
"THE LION KING - BE PREPARED (Metal Cover)","I totally disagree. I know the song forwards and backwards, and, when he did hyenas, his attempts to hit the higher notes he went way too high, leading to my biggest gripe with his singing. He's overextending his voice past where he really should. Is it a passable cover? Yes, is it stellar? Not even close. I expected more based off what his style is, but totally forgot to factor in his desire to try to take everything up to 11.

Granted my thought process is the vocals of the original song were well suited with the backing instrumentals he was using already, which is why I was honestly hoping for him to keep it slightly restrained, with a slight flair that he loves to put into everything."
"THE LION KING - BE PREPARED (Metal Cover)","I guess that if you already love the song, this is understandable. "
"THE LION KING - BE PREPARED (Metal Cover)","Right, not to downplay Pellek, I think he honestly has more potential than most people give him, but damnit I think he needs some proper voice lessons, so he can learn a good range that fits him. When he hits the upper ends of his range his voice can be like nails on a chalkboard. It seems like he really wants to broadcast his range without realizing that just because you have a wide range doesn't mean your range is as well developed as you think.

His cover of Don't Stop Believing was in my mind much better, but the lyrics and original song work so much better with his desire to always hit the highest notes. Part of me would be interested in hearing him attempt to cover a Crimson Glory song, the range that Midnight was able to pull off was something else."
"THE LION KING - BE PREPARED (Metal Cover)","&gt;  I think he needs some proper voice lessons

I can't believe no Norge has offered. He could become great with proper coaching."
"THE LION KING - BE PREPARED (Metal Cover)","From what I can tell he doesn't have the biggest following overall in much of the metal communities, most of his following comes from younger kids who are listening to more pop, where his over strained high notes tend to really be able to work. I suspect he's not getting it because his ""fans"" like what he's doing, so people aren't paying much attention to him, hence why no offerings.

I took another gander at his channel, he's constantly just pandering to requests and it seems to be most of his popular videos are Anime theme songs....that won't get him proper recognition to get adequate voice lessons. If he sticks the path to metal, rather than just ""metal"" covers he could theoretically get some actual recognition."
"THE LION KING - BE PREPARED (Metal Cover)","Indeed, the audience is very young. His worst covers usually get the most praise, but maybe it pays the bills and that's all that matters to him, at least for now. :p"
"THE LION KING - BE PREPARED (Metal Cover)","And your last sentence really makes me wonder if you know him or are him. Especially since you always post his videos.... Damn this internet anonymity! "
"THE LION KING - BE PREPARED (Metal Cover)","lol"
"THE LION KING - BE PREPARED (Metal Cover)","I'm usually one to defend Pellek, but this was an epic fail of epic proportions. I can usually overlook his well documented vocal issues, but they just stood out like a sore thumb to me.

Even worse, the pacing for this song was much, much to frantic.  Had he slowed the pace down it could have been at least tolerable."
"THE LION KING - BE PREPARED (Metal Cover)","I don't know the original, so I'm just enjoying the energy and enthusiasm. :S"
"THE LION KING - BE PREPARED (Metal Cover)","A lotta hate, i'm not a huge fan of Pellek, i think he has a very 'punchable' face. Buut, this was a good cover.

"Your Most Motivational Songs","I do HEMA (historical German longsword fencing), so I created a [Spotify playlist](https://play.spotify.com/user/haibane_rakka/playlist/3zoXilStNl4fcHmFZrJxCi) of the songs which get me the most amped up to fight or train. It has turned into my goto playlist for the gym, cleaning the house, or just generally cheering me up or needing to feel like I can accomplish things when I otherwise don't."

"Galneryus - Enemy to Injustice","Great stuff!"
"Galneryus - Enemy to Injustice","That's my name. Best album of 2014."
"Galneryus - Enemy to Injustice","This album is my favorite album of 2014 by far. Shows a more mature and diverse music compared to earlier albums.
Also the sound quality is much better this time around.
Ninja edit: typo"
"Galneryus - Enemy to Injustice","I still maintain that this is the best song of the album, though lately ""I Wish"" has been giving it a run for its money. "
"Galneryus - Enemy to Injustice","I must be in the minority here, but I couldn't find a single redeeming track on the new album. Been a big fan since the first album, and love both Yama-B and Sho."

"Blind Guardian - Bright Eyes (Intro Vocal Cover Attempt)",""
"Blind Guardian - Bright Eyes (Intro Vocal Cover Attempt)","Decided to do this for fun... I truly have no idea if it was good or not.  This is not quite my style of vocals and I have had some vocal issues for awhile but today was an alright day.  Let me know what 'ya think - be honest and harsh.

Also, as a side note, to me when I listen to this I hear myself just fine - however, that may be because I am trained to the sound of my voice.  Am I too quiet/is the song too loud? I don't have an instrumental version or anything.  If you can't hear me well enough I will reupload with song turned down a bit.


Also, as a second side note, this was recorded with my PHONE.  So... not best mic quality, unsurprisingly."
"Blind Guardian - Bright Eyes (Intro Vocal Cover Attempt)","If that's all you, I like. Get a good mic/interface startup kit or something."
"Blind Guardian - Bright Eyes (Intro Vocal Cover Attempt)","2015 /r/powermetal singer of the year.

This is really good :-)"
"Blind Guardian - Bright Eyes (Intro Vocal Cover Attempt)","Man, this is awesome! I'm going to try imitating Hansi too!"
"Blind Guardian - Bright Eyes (Intro Vocal Cover Attempt)","Timing a little off and a few notes aren't quite pitch perfect but it's still impressive. Always love a good wail. Keep on it dude \m/"
"Blind Guardian - Bright Eyes (Intro Vocal Cover Attempt)","As a singer who's been taking lessons for two years and wishes he wasn't a baritone...


Nice. 


Get a better mic. T_T"
"Blind Guardian - Bright Eyes (Intro Vocal Cover Attempt)","Hansi is a pretty classic baritone (C2-A5ish, if I recall correctly).

And being a baritone for power metal is perfect. Most vocalists are. And you can probably hit some of the higher notes just fine :-)"
"Blind Guardian - Bright Eyes (Intro Vocal Cover Attempt)","Really? Huh. I guess it's a different problem. I run into this thing where it FEELS like I'm hitting the pitch but it feels like these guys are still singing higher than me. If you're a power metal singer, mind if I PM you and ask your advice? "

"Demons &amp; Wizards - Terror Train | Because I'm Actually on a Train Posting This","I recommend the albums Dark Saga, Something Wicked and Horror Show, because Barlow is amazing on vocals. Track wise, Violate, Dark Saga, Question of Heaven, Damien, Wolf, Dracula, My Own Savior, Burning Times and the Something Wicked Trilogy (Prophecy/Birth of the Wicked/Coming Curse) are a good starting point."

"
"Post your favorite PM songs!","I like a lot of Savatage, but I counted them in as 80's Hairband because they just sound like that to me, especially in my favorite by them, Hall of the Mountain King.

Didnt know they were PM.

Edit: I just scrolled down on the hot section and find Hall of the Mountain King. I thought when I discovered Savatage that I was special :(

Edit 2: Good Lord, so much Savatage, I have found my people."
"Post your favorite PM songs!","They are, pretty much, an 80's traditional metal band

and for the most part, Power Metal is stuck in the 80s and doesn't ever want to let go. There's a whole lot of crossover between glam, traditional and power metal, at least when you take the non-symphonic stuff into account. But I think that Jon Oliva's other stuff (Jon Oliva's Pain and TSO) have really worked together to secure him and Savatage as a whole into the power metal area. So, maybe they're not power metal, but I'm not going to genre-war with anyone. Also, if not us, then who will appreciate Savatage? Not r/Metal, for the most part, so it's gotta be us

Also, we just had Savatagurday on r/PowerMetal, so that's why there's so much of it recently"

"Post your favorite PM songs!","I'm new to Power Metal myself, but these are my favourites so far. In alphabetical order.

Everything by Sabaton

Everything by Hammerfall up till the album: Threshold"
"Shear - Heaven into Hell",""
"Shear - Heaven into Hell","Hm... interesting sound. It's hard for me to tell if it's power metal or not. 

This is a band to watch out for, regardless. The music is only a few notches from being awesome"
"Dignity - Project Destiny",""
"Sonata Arctica- Ain't Your Fairytale [5:26] (One of my absolute favorites)",""
"Sonata Arctica- Ain't Your Fairytale [5:26] (One of my absolute favorites)","I remember when I got *Reckoning Night*. I preordered from the Sonata Arctica website and got it all in a pretty package and didn't listen to anything beforehand because SA was my favorite band and I wanted to experience it like it was something important. I think I got it a few days before it was ""officially"" released and I was sooooo disappointed by the first two tracks.

Then this came on. 

I still think *Ain't Your Fairytale* is one of Sonata Arctica's five best songs. "
"Sonata Arctica- Ain't Your Fairytale [5:26] (One of my absolute favorites)","Damn, how can you be disappointed by Misplaced and Blinded No More? Genuinely curious."
"Sonata Arctica- Ain't Your Fairytale [5:26] (One of my absolute favorites)","There's just something *missing* in those songs. I personally think *Blinded No More* is particularly horrible and *Misplaced* is far and away the worst album opener ever.

Those are pretty much the only two bad songs on that album though. I was never really a fan of *Wildfire* when it first came out, but listening to it more recently I think I just overlooked it. The first two still aren't impressive; I'm so glad they were smart enough to cut it out of their setlists after the *Reckoning Night* tour."
"Sonata Arctica- Ain't Your Fairytale [5:26] (One of my absolute favorites)","Misplaced is a great song.  And it's definitely better than Everything Fades to Gray/Deathaura"
"Sonata Arctica- Ain't Your Fairytale [5:26] (One of my absolute favorites)",":-O *Deathaura* is *amazing*. Easily the best track on TDoG. Like. . .not even close.

EDIT: *Zeroes* is pretty solid."
"Sonata Arctica- Ain't Your Fairytale [5:26] (One of my absolute favorites)","I prefer the last amazing grays over deathaura.  Misplaced evokes similar feelings to Abandoned Pleased Brainwashed Exploited.  Pumps me up and gets me ready to listen to the album."
"Sonata Arctica- Ain't Your Fairytale [5:26] (One of my absolute favorites)","It's a Nightwish song, though."

"Sonata Arctica- Ain't Your Fairytale [5:26] (One of my absolute favorites)","I'm with you on Blinded No More, But Misplaced is possibly my favorite SA song.  And those lyrics. God damn, those lyrics. Love them."
"Sonata Arctica- Ain't Your Fairytale [5:26] (One of my absolute favorites)","Always upvote for Sonata Arctica.

Reckoning Night and Silence were the albums that got me into power metal."

"Children of the Sun (Power metal - online collaboration) - vocals by youtubber Eldameldo","Thanks, we're doing many power metal original songs."
"Help me like Sonata Arctica more","I really like their latest album Pariah's Child, despite the super-duper mixed reviews it has been receiving (I think history will look back on this album in much more favorable light; it takes some getting used to it seems). I especially love the song Blood. However, the definition of blood that's read at the beginning of the song, in what sounds like a computer generated voice, really annoys me. 

Can someone give me a good explanation for that definition being read at the beginning of the song, so that it feels like it fits into the song better and I can stop being annoyed by it? "
"Help me like Sonata Arctica more","Listen to both their early and latter work, then get into arguments on which one is better on /r/PowerMetal "
"Help me like Sonata Arctica more","Don't forget to listen to the bonus songs, those tend to get passed by often."
"Help me like Sonata Arctica more","Sorry buddy, everybody fucking hates that narration in *Blood*. I wish I could give you a better reason for it, but it would feel too hypocritical. I just remind myself how good the intro to the song is in order to get past it. 

I know this isn't what you asked for, but are you familiar with their other work? Your text doesn't say you aren't, so I don't want to assume. If not, I'd suggest you check out [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/272nlh/a_beginners_guide_to_sonata_arctica/). Many fans believe that their first 4 albums were their best, and those are where most PM fans' love of SA stem from. "
"Help me like Sonata Arctica more","Thanks for the link, that's great. I know everything from the ""good""  albums and basically nothing from the 3 ""bad"" albums. I think that's why I'm not doing what it seems most old SA fans are doing,  which is **trying** to hate the new stuff. 

And thanks for actually (somewhat) answering the question, despite the answer being a bummer. "
"Help me like Sonata Arctica more","Here's the song: [Sonata Arctica - Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxdHhemkLKo)"
"Help me like Sonata Arctica more","Blood is pretty similar to the stuff on The Days of Grays, maybe check that out.

As for why that narration was there? I dunno. Tony Kakko likes trying to be arty sometimes."
"Help me like Sonata Arctica more","There was something similar in the end of [Wildfire part III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgDtfDDu41Q) from Stones Grow Her Name (skip to 6:40) as well.

Still don't know why it's there, but it's not completely random."

"Sonata Arctica - Larger Than Life","This song definitely on my top 5 SA song list."
"What's on your gym/get-shit-done playlist?","These threads occasionally come back around and I think we're due for one.

"What's on your gym/get-shit-done playlist?","[Sabaton - Twilight of the Thunder God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZrCQFSkLcE)

I'm not a huge Sabaton fan, but their music is really good for personal motivation. 

[Kamelot - March of Mephisto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJh4CijYvRw)

Less of a ""gym"" song and more of a ""get-shit-done"" song.  Having  Roy Khan and Shagrath playing the devil and berating you for weakness  is a hell of a motivator. 

[Visigoth - Mammoth  Rider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aWRh0IkRtc)

Heavy in the oldest sense of the term. 

[Heidevolk - Vulgaris Magistralis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reOLeLX0Q9U)

Not a lot to say. Mammoth riding seems to be a common theme in my favorite get-shit-done songs.

"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","It is that time again -- when we all gather together in glorious feastmaking and merriment and bestow upon our favorite bands honors for their pleasing of our ears. In many of these categories, our warriors battled it out in manners worthy of song. In others, the victors sent their competition to the Hall of the Slain in swift time. But enough of introductions, 

[It is time for the victors to reap their glory!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkD0MxNY_Bw#t=10s)


We start off our awards with **best song!** This was a fierce battle with many fan-favorite entrants. Some entered with pure catichess, others tried weird avant-garde narration, but we're really concerned with who won right now! Well, as it turns out this award is so prestigious that we ended up with the rare occurrence of two winners: **Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods** and **Sabaton - Night Witches!**

But as we all know, a good power metal song is usually accompanied by a thrilling solo. Who bewildered us the most with their guitarists on the spotlight? We have another tie for **best solo**! **Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods** and **Viathyn - Cynosure** share this award!

There's more to a song than guitars, though. So let's give our appreciation to those who fill our speakers and headphones with the **Best Non-guitar Instrumentation!** For the first time in this thread, we have a clear winner! Congratulations to **Alestorm and their Sunset on the Golden Age!**

There's one more thing to fill out a song, unless you're an instrumental band, and so we come to **best vocalist**! Indeed, power metal is a subgenre which tends to care a great deal about the one working the microphone. Who is the glorious warrior to gift us with a voice for the gods this year? **Hansi Kürsch** of Blind Guardian!

However, most of us don't want our vocalists singing random non-sense - the words they sing can help us understand the motivations behind the music, enhance our appreciation of the sounds, or simply just entertain us on their own! And so it is time for **best lyrics!** This one was mostly a battle between love, folklore, and war -- and you guys chose war! **Sabaton - Heroes** wins this category!

The last big piece of what makes an album is its visual approach. My mother always said don't judge a book by its cover, but an album cover is often our first impression of what the music will be like. They aren't always accurate, but that doesn't mean these works of art can't be appreciated on their own. And so we now bestow our judgement for **best album cover!** A falcon, sea, moon, and fire make up the winner for this year -- **Falconer - Black Moon Rising!**

Now let's not kid ourselves. Power metal, and metal in general, is a sausage-fest. So while those albums with fronted by women can often stand easily on their own moments, it's also nice to set aside an award where there's no question that they can share in the spotlight too. And so we now present **Best Female-Fronted Release,** which this year goes to **Ancient Bards and their A New Dawn Ending!**

It can also be tough for unsigned bands to shine too (though Keldian's Outbound won album of the year last year!) And so let us take a moment to appreciate those who are trying to break into this industry and make it big. This year's **Best Unsigned Release** goes to **Noble Beast** and their self-titled album!

Let us sow glory with one more award before we get to what you're all waiting for! We here in power metal pride ourselves with such thing as glory, being epic, charisma, and being mighty. We also look to individuals to embody these ideals. We now crown our **Mightiest Warrior** for 2014! He is well known for his stage energy and putting his aviators on little kids -- congratulations to **Joakim Brodén** of Sabaton!

And now...

[**YOUR ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1De-OI8YG-M)

Many duked it out with their guitars, drums, bass, vocals, diverse instrumentation, lyrics, album art, and songwriting. In the end several bands fought for rather large scraps while one winner emerged. You know them for their stage presence and camo outfits. You know them for their war-based lyrics. You know them for that deep voice, catchy tunes, and plentiful keyboard sound effects! One and all, the Album of the Year Two Thousand Fourteen:

**Sabaton - Heroes!**

But we're not done yet! We have a couple more rewards to go still!

First, this community would be nothing without its users. Yes you guys! You who submit links, contribute to discussions, recommend changes for the subreddit, give us weekly features, vote, and listen! And whilst this community would not be the same if a single one of you were not here, there are those who've contributed more than others, and this is our chance to recognize that. Our **Upsword Award for Best User** goes to **/u/UnlostHorizon!** Wait... he's not here anymore? Well... this is awkward...

Lastly, we must continue our now annual tradition of recognizing those who've had an impact on the subgenre and us all. These are people who can be felt throughout what power metal is today, who've inspired numerous artists, and who've put out one quality release after another, always contributing to the wealth of this art. Last year, we put Kai Hansen in the halls of immortality. This year we recognize **Hansi Kürsch** for the **Lifetime Achievement Award!!**

Unfortunately, that is all we have for 2014. Join us again later this year as the process renews itself!

Disclaimers &amp; The Fine Print: 

This year we were faced with something we had not experienced before: a band (Viathyn) advertising our little corner of the internet's poll to their fans! This wasn't something we mods had planned on, so we had to come up with a solution on-the-go. Many of their fans voted simply for that band in the categories they were nominated for and left everything else alone. We felt that this wasn't playing in the spirit of the subreddit, and so those votes were rendered void. All other votes were left alone. This choice was made while voting was still in its prime, and without take a close look at the current results. That is, we did not make the decision to play favorites. As things turned out, this decision only affected one category - it would have been a sole Viathyn victory for best solo.

This Awards Ceremony brought to you by [Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPTz7z04_OM), which was listened to several times whilst being composed!
"
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","Good writeup. I know that r/powermetal has a bit of a thing for Hansi, but I don't think it was fair that he was even considered for a vocalist award just for singing on two songs in 2014.

Other than that, glad Viathyn won something. "
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","He was on a couple ~~albums~~ songs on Iced Earth's album as well. Regardless, the way I see it is that anyone who performed as a power metal vocalist in 2014 was eligible. If someone sang one live show in 2014, I'd consider that to be enough to qualify. If that performance was great enough to beat out the competition, I don't see why they shouldn't win."
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","Oh, how fitting that self-post icon is!

Ok, now I can take off my MC hat and give my personal take! It was a pretty good year for my picks. Hansi crushed the competition in his categories, and Blind Guardian took the awards they were nominated for, even if they had to share them! Sabaton winning with Heroes was not unexpected, but it remains my opinion that while having several nice, catchy songs, it's at best a mediocre album. Meanwhile, I'd probably put Falconer's Black Moon Rising in my top ten, at least my top fifteen, of all-time power metal albums. It just blows Heroes out of the competition for me.  At least as much of a disappointment for me, if only due to my expectation of Heroes' victory, was Triosphere's loss for best female-fronted release. [The Heart of the Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0) is pure top notch quality power metal, and easily one of the best releases for the subgenre in recent years. I wish it received the recognition in this list that it deserved.

"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","It would be great if you could also give the links to the previous years awards in your thread post. "
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","I'm just surprised BG didn't win EVERYTHING, including the best female-fronted release.

When a couple of guest appearances results in vocalist of the year, you know something's wrong.

Ranting aside, YAY SABATON. And how did Triosphere not win the female-fronted award?"
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","I'm not sure why you two are taking issue with this... He not only had the guest appearances, but also had the single Twilight of the Gods released. Furthermore, I see 'best vocalist' as a 'performance' category. That is, any studio or live performance is enough to qualify if given a nomination. The winner, ideally, is the one who gave the best live or studio performance with their vocals. That's opposed to those categories based more on songwriting: best album, best song, best solo, best instrumentation, etc. The vocal equivalent of that might be 'best vocal melody' or 'best chorus' where *what* the vocalist is singing is more important that specific performance of it, to the extent that those can be separated. Of course, it's my view that Hansi would qualify for those as well, if we had such categories, given the release of Twilight of the Gods in 2014."
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","I understand. I was of the mindset that the focus was on studio releases only. I'm not saying Hansi is not eligible for the category, but I'm sure there are other vocalists who have a greater claim to that title.

In the end, though, that's only my opinion. I certainly don't want to make a big deal out of this... I just can't help but feel that /r/PowerMetal's bias towards BG skewed the votes significantly. That said, ""Twilight of the Gods"" is a magnificent track well-deserving of the title of song of the year. "
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","/r/PowerMetal has a bias towards several bands. It's the nature of contests like these that they show those biases. "
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","I realize that. I have several biases myself, as well :p

Don't mind me, though. Excellent work in putting this together, by the way! Enjoyable read"
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","Well, Beyond The Red Mirror came out in 2015, so Twilight of The Gods is the only track that can qualify for 2014."
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","Whoops. Not a single person/album/song I voted for won. I guess I'm doing something wrong.

EDIT: Except Noble Beast. That album is perfect."
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","Chris Bowes wins best non-guitar instrumentation two years in row.  Think about that for a second.  That means people listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BWvkBOqrz8) and think ""Man, this is as good as it gets!""

What the hell kind of Twilight Zone am I living in?"
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","Thanks dude! I put my heart and soul into wooden leg.

Though on a serious note, we appreciate this. We are finding ourselves in a world where we are pretty much the only power (kindof) metal band that plays fully live - everyone else is sticking their keyboards and orchestras and acoustic guitars and backing vocals on a tape for live shows. So the fact y'all like what we do is heartwarming :)"
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","if only that was one of the better songs on the album. listen to sunset on the golden age or the battle of cartagena and its obvious why they won"

Also Sabaton had no business winning best album IMO but whatever, seems like they're the kind of band that'll get an award from this sub every year they release an album "
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","&gt; Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods

Hey, what the fu-

\*listens\*

Oh, it's an original."
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","I'm a bit disappointed that DragonForce didn't get anything, but I'm quite into Sabaton, and they fucking cleaned up here, so...I guess I'll take it! Congratulations to Sabaton, and Joakim!"
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","2014 was the strongest year in power metal in at least a decade for me, but I'm pretty disappointed with the results here. I love the new Blind Guardian album, but they only released the single in 2014. I don't like the idea of them winning everything they were nominated in just based on that one song, as great as it was. 

I'm also a bit disappointed to see Sabaton win so much. Heroes is great, but I felt like it was a relatively standard effort in a year where many other bands stepped up their game (HammerFall, Edguy, Freedom Call, Dragonforce, Sonata Arctica, etc.). 

Also, I can't believe Kiske didn't win his category. Perhaps I overstate the influence of the two Keepers albums, but without those power metal is a completely different genre of music.

With that said, Blind Guardian and Sabaton are awesome bands, so it's really not that bad. "
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","I can say that in future awards we'll definitely be taking another look at the process to see what we can do to improve it.

And there will be more Lifetime Achievement Awards to distribute - Kiske is definitely a deserving name to win one in a future year."
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","On the first point: at the end of the day, it's still a poll voted on by the majority. Even if I wouldn't vote for them based on one song, a lot of people did, so it's not like it's unfair. 

And for the second, it might be better to do more than 1 person in a year. It's similar to a power metal hall of fame: there are more deserving candidates than there will ever be spots. I just personally think Kiske is far more important than Hansi. "

Wait, wasn't this a joke nomination?

Honestly, these results are rather disappointing. I'm happy that Noble Beast won best unsigned, but it's hard to even tell people about that because the rest of the results kinda bring the whole poll into question. (That's not to say that Blind Guardian and Sabaton didn't deserve to win something, just not *everything*.)"
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","I love me some Sabaton and I did enjoy that album but honestly this was one of the best years on record for me and I'd love to have seen other stars shine through instead of yet more Sabaton and BG.

But expectedly this is the popular vote so the biggest and most known bands are going to get voted in even though Sabaton's was a pretty standard offering and BG had only JUST put out a single and it was already overshadowing everything else."
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","Well it looks like Blind Guardian are going to take out most of this years categories with the new album, but Symphony X could still release something amazing this year. Fucked if I know how Sabaton won album of the year, let alone anything else."
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","This is why we need a separate tier for BG and high exposure releases."
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","I'm definitely open to changes being made in future years, but these things are always going to come down to circlejerks. It's a popularity contest and nothing more. It's also worth mentioning that Keldian, an unsigned band largely unknown in the power metal scene, won AotY in 2013."

"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who thought Blind Guardian's nominations/wins are not without question. Granted, this should have been mentioned when the nominations took place, not when the winner is announced. Hindsight or whatever..."
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","I know that there are some complains about BG being the winner in most categories, but (please do not shoot the messenger) what other band was hyped and spoken about during the last three month on r/Powermetal.

The moment they announced the new Album back in November there was not much left which was posted in the forums.

Just look at the top scoring links for last month.....top six are all Guardian links.

There was no mentioning of Sonata Artica who published a really good Album, or Evergrey with ""Hymns for the Broken"" or Iced Earth with Plagues of Babylon which all came out in 2014.

Nature of the beast is that the one who get's mentioned last will be remembered. 

So maybe this year we will try to member Bands who's album came out before November."

"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","Along with the other posters I'm kinda disappointed that Blind Guardian (and Hansi) won all the awards that Sabaton didn't win, after only releasing a single, since they are going to win them all (and rightly so) this year for their latest album. Also unless I'm mistaken didn't /u/unlosthorizon win the same award last year? Not that he doesn't deserve the recognition or anything. I can hardly argue with the results anyway since I worship Blind Guardian as much as everyone else on this subreddit. Thanks for wrapping this up for us /u/Edledhron after it was left unfinished by the old mod. Congrats to all the well-deserved winners and [here's](http://ooligan.pdx.edu/img/cheers1.jpg) to another year of awesome Power Metal."
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","You linked to Albedo by viathyn instead of Cynosure (the song) at the end

Darn, Noble Beast won best unsigned as expected. Can't complain much because it's a kickass release, although I liked Cynosure better. Wow, BG and Sabaton won like everything, I think we should tier this awards setup a bit more or else it is more of a popularity contest. Something like ""Which was better, BG or Sabaton"" as a question or ""Best Big Release""."
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","Thanks for pointing that out - fixed!

Awards like these will always be a popularity contest, unless we radically change the format. It's literally just an open poll. However, we can make changes to the Awards in future years if people would like that."
"Ladies, Gentlemen, Those Who Identify as Non-Binary: Your /r/PowerMetal Awards Ceremony 2014!!!!!","I'm kind of disappointed, but I understand the huge popularity variable makes the biggest difference. I just hope no one forgets the incredible releases in 2014 from DragonForce, Galneryus, MindMaze, and Twilight Force. I'm glad to see Falconer and Noble Beast up there though. Also, the new font on the right-hand bar is so sexy! "

"Why my musical taste is superior to yours, part 1 of 4","I am not ashamed to admit that I was actually looking forward to reading about how your musical taste is superior to my own. No joke, I find that kind of thing interesting."
"Why my musical taste is superior to yours, part 1 of 4","Okay, let's do it. Let's report as best as possible the facts and circumstances surrounding your music taste's sick analects. Just so you know, I plan to spend a good deal of this post discussing your music taste and its overweening wisecracks. I also plan to say a bit about how to avoid producing another generation of prejudice and inequity we must overcome the obstacles that people like your music taste establish, but I'll save that part for the end.

Nations that tolerate denying minorities a cultural voice will perish certainly and perish forever. Let me explain. To understand your music taste's motives, I feel that we must examine the deep culture of your music taste's cabal—its key psychosocial traits, good and bad. If we do so, I predict we'll discover that your music taste keeps missing my point. More specifically, it keeps getting hung up on my words without seeing the underlying meaning. For example, when I say that I must unmistakably add my voice to the chorus of those who transcend traditional thinking, your music taste seems incapable of realizing that what I'm really getting at is that it's exceedingly irritating, psychotic, morally repugnant, malign, inarticulate, sleazy, obtrusive, voluble, ungrateful, and conscienceless. Sorry for the synathroesmus, but your music taste's plan is to delude and often rob those rendered vulnerable and susceptible to its snares because of poverty, illness, or ignorance. Your music taste's adulators are moving at a frightening pace toward the total implementation of that agenda, which includes causing this country to flounder on the shoals of self-interest, corruption, and chaos.

The important point here is not that to the fullest extent that my age and health will permit, I, not being one of the many lackluster scandalmongers of this world, will expand people's understanding of your music taste's complacent tractates. The vital matter is that I can easily see your music taste performing the following raving acts. First, it will skewer me over a pit barbecue. Then, it will lead us, lemminglike, over the precipice of self-destruction. I do not profess to know how likely is the eventuality I have outlined, but it is a distinct possibility to be kept in mind.

Your music taste's wheelings and dealings manifest themselves in two phases. Phase one: make widespread accusations and insinuations without having the facts to back them up. Phase two: sully my reputation. Some people have said that conversations with your music taste are no more intellectual than a game of darts at the local pub. Maybe. But I'm more inclined to believe that your music taste feels that it can convince criminals to fill out an application form before committing a crime. Go home, your music taste; you're drunk. Any sober person would realize that to someone whose eyes are open, your music taste's constantly repeated mantra that criminals are merely social rebels is an insanely self-serving notion. By way of contrast, consider my personal mantra that a bunch of profoundly logorrheic thickheads have recently been accused of silencing anyone whom your music taste considers inhumane. Your music taste's fingerprints are all over that operation. Even if it turns out that it is not ultimately responsible for instigating it, the sheer amount of its involvement demands answers. For instance, how can we break your music taste's hypnotic spell over irascible schmoes? It's an interesting question, and its examination will help us understand how your music taste's policies work. Let me start by providing evidence that you shouldn't let your music taste intimidate you. You shouldn't let it push you around. We're the ones who are right, not your music taste.

Your music taste has a strategy. Its strategy is to frog-march its opponents into the nearest detention center or internment camp. Wherever you encounter that strategy, you are dealing with your music taste.

Your music taste decries or dismisses capitalism, technology, industrialization, and systems of government borne of Enlightenment ideas about the dignity and freedom of human beings. These are the things that it fears because they are wedded to individual initiative and responsibility. Here's some news for people who are surprised by sunrise: Your music taste ought to unstop its ears and uncover its eyes. Only then will it hear that to which it has been too long heedless. Only then will your music taste see that you should be able to live your life the way you want to live it. You shouldn't have to live in fear of your music taste doing the entire country a grave disservice.

Your music taste is addicted to the feeling of power, to the idea of controlling people. Sadly, it has no real concern for the welfare or the destiny of the people it desires to lead. As will become apparent by the end of the decade, despite your music taste's self-image as the primary civilizing force of modern times, it seems clear that one often finds your music taste in the company of sinful deadbeats or other unsavory characters. But we ought to look at the matter in a broader framework before we draw final conclusions on the subject: We see that if it weren't for your music taste's double standards it would have no standards at all. Hence, it's entirely a waste of time even to address your music taste's hypocrisy. That's why I'll state merely that I would like to believe that it acts with our interests in mind. I really would. But your music taste sure makes it difficult to believe such things. For instance, it avouches that clever one-liners are a valid substitute for actual thinking. As you can no doubt determine from comments like that, facts and your music taste are like oil and water.

Just as night follows day, your music taste will lobotomize everyone caught thinking an independent thought in the blink of an eye. Viewing all this from a higher vantage point, we can see that concrete examples abound of ways to strengthen our roots so we can weather the storms that threaten our foundation. For instance, consider that your music taste claims that the betterment of society depends upon its spoon-feeding us its pabulum. I have my told-you-so's primed and ready to go as soon as people start noticing that by letting your music taste do something as uninformed as that, we are forgetting that if we fail to hammer out solutions on the anvil of discourse then all of our sacrifices will be as forgotten as the sand blowing across Ozymandias's dead empire. The “decay of that colossal wreck,” as the poet Shelley puts it, teaches us that some people apparently believe that if we don't bother your music taste, your music taste won't bother us. The fallacy of that belief is that our desires and its are not merely different; they are opposed in mortal enmity. Your music taste wants to treat anyone who doesn't agree with it to a torrent of vitriol and vilification. We, in contrast, want to alert people that its brand of statism focuses on granting more power to unambitious patrioteers regardless of the implication for others. Your music taste-inspired statism further advocates that these folks use their newly attained power for good or evil as they individually decide. I reject this and every other form of statism because your music taste must have some sort of problem with reading comprehension. That's the only explanation I can come up with as to why your music taste accuses me of admitting that its activities are on the up-and-up. What I actually said is that if it were up to me, I would create a political atmosphere in which the zero-sum model of group competition gives way to coalitions among groups so that they can work together to lead us all toward a better, brighter future. At a minimum, I would like to see more people acknowledge that your music taste would have us believe that the goodness of something is in direct proportion only to the amount of teetotalism in said thing. Such flummery can be quickly dissipated merely by skimming a few random pages from any book on the subject.


Out of the vast number of devastating evils for which jackbooted gutter-bloods are directly or indirectly responsible, I shall pick out only a single one which is most in keeping with the inner essence of your music taste's raffish traducements: allotheism. I have two words to say about your music taste's excuses: treacherous poppycock. You might think that anyone who doesn't know that your music taste is mean-spirited must be inhabiting a different world. Well, if that's the case, then I'm afraid your music taste's epigones must have spent the past month on Mars. Until we address this issue, we will never move beyond it."

"Freedom Call - Hunting High And Low","It's ever so close to the Stratovarius version, almost so close that I can't enjoy it fully because I hear the little similarities in vocal delivery, the chorus, the similar sort of backing tracks... 

I couldn't listen to the chorus fully because I kept expecting ""I AM HUNTING HIGH AND LOW"" instead of ""I AM HUNTING HIGH..."" "
"Freedom Call - Hunting High And Low","Everytime I hear this song start up, I listen up to see if I hear the Stratovarius song of the same name. (it is there in the intro, but otherwise it's not there)"

I am swedish and I think it's fun when I understand words from the lyrics :)"
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","I love this song and I have no fucking clue what they're talking about."
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","Wait wait wait. So you're telling me, that they're singing in swedish?"
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","No no no, it is faroese, but all nordic languages have a lot of similar words"
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","Oh, you're propably right. I was kinda confused, because a band called Raubtier is singing in Swedish (i think) and it sounds nothing like this Tyr song. But maybe that's because i have nothing to do with any of nordic laungages, so i don't really know what i'm talking about. All i know is that it sounds lovely."
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","It depends a lot on the context, Faroese and Icelandic are very different from the other Nordic languages(Danish, Norwegian and Swedish) that are more similar to each other. Some can be understood, but some is just down-right incomprehensible.

And yeah, Raubtier sings in Swedish."

"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","I always liked this one. Even more so when I understood the lyrics. [Turid Torkilsdottir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqmgpuZLsXQ) from the same album is also pretty cool."
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","Gunnar -- probably happiest bassist I ever seen"
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","The singer is an asshole. So much so that I find it hard to listen to them knowing how much of a prick he is to his fans."
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","Elaborate? I've never met the guy."
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","I saw him outside a show in Denver. He was about as enthused talking to his fans as if he was watching paint dry while the other members were being very friendly and excited. I didn't really care because I'm not a big fan (plus I got to meet one of the guys from Metsatoll who was super cool). During Tyr's set he was even less exciting. He looked obviously pissed off and bored and his vocals were really off. Probably because he had to open for two other bands (Moonsorrow and Korpiklaani) and no one was there to see him. I would expect more out of an established musician, but still I didn't really care. However, the next day I was shown an interview where he more or less referred to actual pagans (I.E. most if his fan base) as crazy idiots and that the whole pagan thing is just fiction. Gaahl would behead him. Better yet, Johan Hegg, who is also an atheist, would never denounce paganism publicly. Not a cool thing to write off half your fans as crazy and declare your lyrical content as, more or less, a joke. I hope that clarifies my point enough. Let me just say that if you like Tyr musically you should definitely listen to Ensiferum and Wintersun."
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","I saw about half their set in Glasgow (opening for Korpiklaani and Sabaton). They were competent anyways. I can see what you mean about him being a dick though. Ah well, I guess he should stick to singing :)"
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","We'll give him the benefit of having to compete with Korpiklaani and Sabaton live. Those two might be the two most entertaining live bands ever, each in their own unique way too!"
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","What do you mean by ""actual pagans""? If you mean people who actually believe Odin and Thor exist I highly doubt that's most of their fan base. "
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","What do you mean ""asshole""? He seems pretty nice on facebook."
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","I probably should have defended that statement within my original post. I've already ranted enough. please read above. It's of course all my own perception and opinion. "
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","Honestly, he used to be really cool and he still sort of is depending on what day you get him and who else is around.

I think his problem is that he thinks he's smarter than everyone. About everything and every topic. I don't know if he really is or not, but he has a very pretentious/smug attitude that's pretty obvious once you talk to him for more than 5-10 minutes.

I respect the hell out of the guy, but he's been kind of a dick the last few years. I agree. A lot of it changed once *By The Light of the Northern Star* came out. They had a bit of success and totally changed their style (I feel like I always tell the story when I asked him about that album moving away from the progressive sound and he said, straight-faced, ""We made the album more accessible so we could make more money.""). That's why I really like Heljareyga right now, that's his passion project.

As for Gunnar is the happiest bassist I've ever seen. Agreed. Although he did try to [rip my head off](https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t31.0-8/170244_650911006989_3053345_o.jpg) about four years ago. I'm not thaaat small. He's massive.


Source: Have been chatting with Heri for 7-8 years (Facebook until *The Lay of Thrym* album, now just when they come to town). He's become kind of a dick."
"Týr - Hold The Heathen Hammer High","Yes exactly. His becoming of a dick must be recent them. I saw him in 2012 so maybe I'm ignorant of his awesomeness. I do think he believes he's smarter than everyone else"

"Power Violin","[Ulytau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXd2gbyjsUg) is more folk metal than power, but they're a fantastic band with a very talented violinist. This whole album from the link is instrumental metal versions of classical music and traditional folk songs from their country, Kazakhstan.

[Dalriada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_FJEoXwkNE). Again, folk/power metal. Sometimes their songs make me dance.

Tristania has some violins sometimes, but I think it's out of this subreddit's scope. Also, dive into folk metal, and you'll find plenty of violins and some other instruments you never knew existed"

"I thought some of you may want to know that Herman Li and Sam Totman of DragonForce wrote and performed a song for BABYMETAL titled ""The One""","I'm still completely amazed that babymetal hasn't been completely dismissed by the metal community. People have taken it more of something fun and silly because japanese/korean culture is becoming more ""cool"". Seeing THIS many people at one of their shows is astounding and confusing though. I suppose with asian and american culture getting more interested with each other it was just a matter of time.

Personally, I'm a fan because this is the last thing I would have ever expected. It's so obscure. You just can't take it too serious.

As for DF working with them, GOOD! They've always catered to their japanese fanbase slightly more than others. If babymetal is going to be a thing, this is one way of making it somewhat more tolerable haha."
"I thought some of you may want to know that Herman Li and Sam Totman of DragonForce wrote and performed a song for BABYMETAL titled ""The One""","Also, DF didn't write any ""WHOAAA OHHHH OH OH!"" sections into their last two albums. I laughed at how fucking long the whoaaaa section went on for  in the video."
"I thought some of you may want to know that Herman Li and Sam Totman of DragonForce wrote and performed a song for BABYMETAL titled ""The One""","They were saving up their ""whoas"" and decided to blow them all on this, clearly."
"I thought some of you may want to know that Herman Li and Sam Totman of DragonForce wrote and performed a song for BABYMETAL titled ""The One""","Not sure how to judge the execution, but this is accurate."
"I thought some of you may want to know that Herman Li and Sam Totman of DragonForce wrote and performed a song for BABYMETAL titled ""The One""","&gt; I suppose with asian and american culture getting more interested with each other it was just a matter of time.

That's a weird thing to say.

First, there is no ""Asian culture""; every country has its own culture. Japan's culture is very different from China's culture, etc.

Second, metal isn't American culture: according to The Metal Archives, there are only ~21k bands (not all of them active) from the USA and they claim to have over 100k bands in their database. (I couldn't find an exact up to date number, but they made a blog post about reaching 100k recently.) And DragonForce is British, by the way.

Third, metal was already popular in Japan before BABYMETAL started. TMA lists over 1500 bands from Japan, but many bands from other countries frequently have Japanese tours and/or include bonus tracks for the Japanese versions of their albums."
"I thought some of you may want to know that Herman Li and Sam Totman of DragonForce wrote and performed a song for BABYMETAL titled ""The One""","INb4 people getting pissed and saying it's not metal

I'm not of that party, to be clear. I do not classify band genres based on my opinion.

Also, lol @ Babyforce"
"I thought some of you may want to know that Herman Li and Sam Totman of DragonForce wrote and performed a song for BABYMETAL titled ""The One""","It's not released yet, but it'll probably see an early 2015 release. I'll be honest and admit that it's not 100% confirmed that they wrote and performed it, but...c'mon...

[Exhibit C](https://www.facebook.com/hermanli.online/posts/10152864230839711)

Exhibit D - this video; that's some undeniable DF guitar hooks in the intro, and that ""whoa"" part sounds like every other song DF has written.

Thoughts? Instead of blindly downvoting because it's BABYMETAL, how about we get some opinions on how people feel about DF doing a collab with BABYMETAL. Is it good or bad for DragonForce and for power metal? Has your opinion on BABYMETAL changed after seeing this video? This isn't their first undeniable power metal track, and judging by their recent focus on performing at metal festivals this year (Sonisphere, Heavy MTL, Loud Park), I'd venture to say you're going to hear a lot more metal in their music.

Also, ""recorded"", not ""performed"", my bad."
"I thought some of you may want to know that Herman Li and Sam Totman of DragonForce wrote and performed a song for BABYMETAL titled ""The One""","IMO, the metal genre is still more full of itself than it's ever had the right to be, and it's just as manufactured as anything out there to begin with. I have no illusions about that, I just like the music. And that's all it really is; it's just music and art. IMO BM is fun, a kind of mindless fun that I like at least, nothing more, and I fucking love that about it. Helloween were fun and weird once upon a time, even SA too. Hell, anyone remember Mr. Bungle? If it acts as a gateway to other bands for someone, great. But it's fun enough as it is to me. "
"I thought some of you may want to know that Herman Li and Sam Totman of DragonForce wrote and performed a song for BABYMETAL titled ""The One""","If they can actually make more good power metal instead of making weird J-Pop metal, I might actually be interested. So we'll have to wait and see if they start making more straightforward power metal. I am hopeful though, maybe Dragonforce can be a positive influence on them."
"I thought some of you may want to know that Herman Li and Sam Totman of DragonForce wrote and performed a song for BABYMETAL titled ""The One""","In terms of exposure I'm sure it's great for both Babymetal and DragonForce.  For power metal in general, no, it's still a turd.

The average metal fan won't appreciate the manufactured nature of the band, the cutesy juxtaposition, the emphasis on choreography and underemphasis on anyone actually playing an instrument.  It's for people who say ""kawaii"" out loud and spend their days posting unfunny memes of teenage Japanese girls.

It's a fad and will either die quickly or spawn it's own weird little thing, don't expect any miracles of metal adoption.  Without a switch to English language I doubt it will spread much past the weeaboo population."

Regardless of how one feels about Babymetal, this is really the key thing. The band largely relies on a gimmick -- and it doesn't help the band's or style's popularity that that gimmick is a blending of two styles who's audiences don't have much overlap. 

This really isn't going to effect DragonForce or power metal at all. DragonForce fans already aren't known for being the core of the core power metal listeners, and I don't see many people discovering Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray, or Falconer from a Babymetal introduction."

I'm not sure what the ""BABYMETAL sound"" is supposed to be actually."
"I thought some of you may want to know that Herman Li and Sam Totman of DragonForce wrote and performed a song for BABYMETAL titled ""The One""","I hear a J-Pop sound from most of their songs"
"Songs similar to A Quest For the Crown by Falconer?","Hi, I really like the folk sound of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOpL0Y3Ygdk) song by Falconer, and I was wondering if anyone knew of any bands that perform similar styles of music?"
"Songs similar to A Quest For the Crown by Falconer?","Well, there's the easy answer of the other Falconer songs that also use tambourine (I'm not sure how familiar you are with Falconer's discography, which is why I bring it up), which would be *Lament of a Minstrel, Tower of the Queen, Child of Innocence* and *Scoundrel and the Squire*. But, that doesn't *really* answer your question, so I'll move on.

So, there's some Blind Guardian songs as well, I figure they're probably your best bet.

[Skalds and Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3_S1Q40HZo)  
[The Bard's Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC7iR577OQw)

So I also like [Battlelore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPzc5s1JXXY), although they're Epic/Symphonic and not power, as well as using growls from time to time. [Fairyland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21JTcHB9USM) is another band which I see with the medieval-y sound a bit. I'm going to second [Rhapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XICdeUlTmQ4) as a suggestion as well.

There's also the question of exactly how much metal you want, because there's certainly some [softer music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-21AtiWV3TE) that I would suggest. One thing which rather bothers me is that medieval metal really refers to music that is actually medieval style, rather than sounding ""medieval"", like this Falconer song does. Not to mention, it's all in German (which I like, but it makes it difficult to recommend for others).

Since I don't really know anything about what music you listen to, I'm just going to assume you don't listen to any folk metal. (If you do, I'm sorry. :P) So, first of all, [Skyclad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOwxjxEwZgA). [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwlRmv8TEWA) [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kigXJfNu_A). There's also [Elvenking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgzlOMVyL2g), who are power/folk band. It should be noted that none of these bands are really much like Falconer at all, but it's all good regardless. [Tengwar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynr7i2ozPec) is also a band that I would recommend. [Saltatio Mortis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXe8Z-GhayU) usually sings in German, but they're a pretty good folky band.

Sadly, I've sort of gone it bit off topic, but I just want you to know that I reached all of these bands after finding Falconer and looking to find similar music. So, if I like it, I figure you might as well. Besides, I would rather have some answers that are wrong or unhelpful than no answers at all."
"Songs similar to A Quest For the Crown by Falconer?","Thanks for all these suggestions! I really like those Skyclad songs, I will be checking out more of them soon. You've given me a good list of music that I like, and I am sure I can branch out from here, so thanks again!"

"Avantasia - Dweller in a Dream",""
"Avantasia - Dweller in a Dream","The linked video is Not Available, at least to me.

Great track though. That whole album is a masterpiece"
"Avantasia - Dweller in a Dream","Ah, that's too bad... this was the only version of the song I was able to find on youtube. "
"Avantasia - Dweller in a Dream","Everyone should own the album anyway!"
"Avantasia - Dweller in a Dream","You'd think one of the best albums of 2013 would have full YouTube coverage.

No worries though, I'll just play the album myself :p"
"Avantasia - Dweller in a Dream","These were great two years for Tobias, in my opinion. I generally didn't like Avantasia past Metal Opera I &amp; II or last few Edguy albums, but both bands' latest releases were great.  "
"Avantasia - Dweller in a Dream","Yup - linked video not available."
"Avantasia - Dweller in a Dream","I'm in the USA and it works fine. It's one of those videos posted under the channel titled ""Avantasia - Topic"". I'm pretty sure it's a YouTube-run channel, which is pretty weird.

For those of you who can't see the Avantasia video, can you see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCZtiMZVE1Y) video or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fvK4Mu-PS8) video?"
"Avantasia - Dweller in a Dream","Can't view those videos either. Perhaps they are US only?"
"Avantasia - Dweller in a Dream","It's very possible, since it seems like YouTube uploads these songs themselves. They all follow the same template too. [Basically like this, but with the appropriate info for the song](http://i.imgur.com/rfIhADQ.png). They've got quite a lot of 2014 metal releases uploaded this way too, and I have no idea why YT is doing this."
"Avantasia - Dweller in a Dream","I find it altogether strange that YT is uploading power metal videos. It's not exactly a popular genre that would generate them a lot of ad revenues. "
"Avantasia - Dweller in a Dream","It's not just power metal. They've got everything from Miley Cyrus to Exodus uploaded. It's really quite impressive actually."
"Avantasia - Dweller in a Dream","Wow, that baffles me. Other vids get deleted for copyright infringement, and now YT does the exact same thing?"

"DragonForce - Three Hammers",""
"DragonForce - Three Hammers","Man, I loved this album, those one is one of the best.  

My favorite aspect of the new Dragonforce is their songs are finally about something. Each one has a story or a theme, rather than generic lyrics about the universe or fighting. "
"DragonForce - Three Hammers","Universe, Fighting... Or fire..."
"DragonForce - Three Hammers","Fighting for the universe through freedom and fiiiire  
Swords of holy vengeance for our sooouuuls  
eternallll eternityyyy  "
"DragonForce - Three Hammers","I actually don't know if that's a Dragonforce song or if you made that up."
"DragonForce - Three Hammers","Made it up. It's pretty easy.  

Blazing through glory with the power of the sword  
Glory and the power of the universe    
Eternal fire and glory divine   
Something something so far away   "
"DragonForce - Three Hammers","This is hilarious."
"DragonForce - Three Hammers","I had written some Dragonforce songs a while ago just as an in-joke with my friends, and they really reached legendary status amongst our peer group. One of them was simply called ""Eternal Eternity"" and that was the end of the chorus. Just a loud, wailing ""ETERNALLL ETERNITTTAAYYY"". "
"DragonForce - Three Hammers","Anything Dragonforce reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqH1kMG5P0Q&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=GHXX) video haha"

"DragonForce - Three Hammers","There's also [time](http://imgur.com/glGf5J9)"
"DragonForce - Three Hammers","Well, they've had theme songs in the past, but even those were kind of vague about it, and tended to stray from the point, and the only ones I can think of off the top of my head were from Ultra Beatdown. This, on the other had, is laser-focused on the story it's telling, and follows from beginning to end. As a big DragonForce guy, it's a development I heartily approve of."
"DragonForce - Three Hammers","This was about the only track I liked off the new album."
"DragonForce - Three Hammers","What about Tomorrow's Kings?! That chorus is catchy as fuck."
"DragonForce - Three Hammers","I will have to give that one a re-listen, I didn't give that album much of a chance to be honest, I was quite bored of it after a couple listens. I am drawing a blank on how that song even sounded."

"Alestorm - Wolves of the Sea","I love Alestorm. They're just so unashamedly fun. It also helps that Chris is a genuinely awesome dude. I've seen both his bands live, and both times he spent most of the night just running from group to group in the crowd and having a chat with everyone."
"Alestorm - Wolves of the Sea","I saw these guys back in the day with Tyr and Suidakra. They were awesome!"
"Alestorm - Wolves of the Sea","Probably my favourite folk metal band"
"Alestorm - Wolves of the Sea","Such an awesome cover. "
"Alestorm - Wolves of the Sea","Oh wow. I listened to the original song so many times when it was on Eurovision in 2008 or something, and it's been years since my last listen. Got kind of nostalgic here, so thanks for that. Great cover, made the song much better probably."

"Pyramaze New Album Countdown Announcement","That is a fantastic question. The last post on their website is woefully out of date, but I think it might be Urban Breed, but I'm not familiar with him or if he still is in the band."
"Pyramaze New Album Countdown Announcement","They said a while back in a facebook message that Urban is no longer in the band. They're going to announce the new singer and most likely debut the video they've been shooting along with the rest of the album details."
"Pyramaze New Album Countdown Announcement","Thanks for the information!"

Hope that made sense. "
"Quick survey","6 upvotes, 3 comments...

For me, Lost Horizon live footage with Wojtek still in the band"
"Quick survey","Helloween's Dark Ride tour would be interesting for the set list and how older songs would sound with the Dark Ride vibe.

Also, Hammerfall during Crimson Thunder when they toured with Dio when he did Killing the Dragon. That's a Power Metal wet dream right there."
"Quick survey","The next HammerFall North American tour would have been even better IMO. They were touring Chapter V while Edguy was with them doing Hellfire Club.

Actually, even their first tour in the late 90s with Death touring The Sound of Perseverance would have been awesome. Other than their last tour, HammerFall has been pretty on point with their North American tours."
"Quick survey","Gamma Ray - Power Plant or Somewhere out in Space"
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Looking for some top-notch stuff."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Hehe Edguy Space Police. Dat Chorus."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","I like Edguy, but haven't tried their newer stuff, so I'll give this a go. Thanks."

And I can never get enough of Kotipelto's voice."

"What's your favourite song, and why?","[If I Could Fly by Helloween.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NJqLjlzez4) Musically it's fantastic but mainly it inspires me to think about all the things I could do in life if I had more confidence, willpower, etc. It means quite a lot to me."

"What's your favourite song, and why?","Fellow Symphonic Metal lover here. I'll try listing bands not mentioned already

* [Creek Mary's Blood by Nightwish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zARXrhcK_eo). In general, they used synths in the early albums and had an Operatic singer. The latter albums had a pop singer and used more orchestra. They have a new singer now, and she has potential
* [Xandria--Nightfall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGTAmmTiD_Y)
* [Keldian--The whole Outbound album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUreKfeBGWk)

There's more, but I just got home from work and my mind is fried
"
"What's your favourite song, and why?","I really like Ghost Love Score from the same album. The other two I haven't heard of, thanks."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","All-time?

Sonata Arctica - *White Pearl, Black Oceans*. 

No other song takes me through the rollercoaster that that one does.


There are other songs in that *whoa-this-is-a-perfect-song* tier (I could probably list about 12 others that are totally 10/10 songs but just missing *something*. . .), yet I still haven't heard anything in 10 years that compares to *White Pearl, Black Oceans*."

"What's your favourite song, and why?","I tend to obsess over Blind Guardian and (to a lesser extent) Rhapsody (of Fire).

I find it really hard to get into new stuff, though I've started listening to Sonata Arctica this evening and they're not bad."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Pathfinder -  Beyond the Space, Beyond the Time

I just always get an epic feeling and go a bit mental when it comes on. The guitar work in general but especially the guitar v keyboard duel right at the end really, really do it for me. Like, super do it."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Yeah I love that song. Pathfinder are another of my favourite bands, though I don't have many."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Another one of these, eh. Fairyland - Score to a New Beginning."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Thanks, and I'm new to this subreddit :P"
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Wasn't complaining :P Welcome to the magical land of /r/PowerMetal."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Thanks, it seems like a good place for new music. Though not specifically a power metal fan, I'm into a subgenre; symphonic power metal. 

Orchestras and stuff combined with power metal, love it."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Oh, all right. Well, Score to a New Beginning is pretty much the ultimate symphonic power metal track. You could also try Avantasia - The Wicked Symphony"
"What's your favourite song, and why?","I'll give those a go, thanks again :) "
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Listen to the Scarecrow as well."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Will do."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","It's always a joy to have ones that are seeking enlightenment visit"
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Definitely the whole album and not just the song, despite the song being a masterpiece by itself. Score to a New Beginning is at the end of a massive buildup of other songs"
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Anything off the transcendence album by crimson glory. That album is just prog-power metal goodness "
"What's your favourite song, and why?","I'll look into it, thanks."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","All time has gotta include [Mindtraveller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yMsxQWuWvE), [The Clarion Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iswq0SWBRFA) and [Perjury and Sanctity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERc-_8rzF1o)

They're really hard to explain, of course, but I think Mindtraveller has an unrivaled feeling of adventure, the Clarion Call is just a pretty epic song in its scope and Perjury and Sanctity has got a really sweet chorus.

It changes of course, but right now I'm feeling [Kiuas - Warrior Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hQRpu_cYEg) as well (warning: it's a bit heavier than most power metal. the two growls at the beginning are it for harsh vocals though)

I love this song because it really has the sort of warrior-of-nature pagan/druidic feeling to it. However, it's also pretty heavy and the lyrics and vocals and instrumentation all feel top notch. I'm not assuming you'll like it, but I'd be remiss if I didn't include it."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","Thanks for all of those. It's great to hear what other people love to listen to."
"What's your favourite song, and why?","[Galneryus - Point of No Return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRPlkCug0D4)

From the keys in the intro to the great chorus and then to the amazing guitar and keyboard solos; this song has everything that I'd want in a power metal song."

"New single from Sleeping Romance: ""Fire and Ice""","I think you're similar to /u/70000TonsOfMetal in that regard. As he puts it, he likes his men to sound like women and his women to sound like men. I'm guessing you like bands like Triosphere and Unleash the Archers, but not stuff like Epica and Nightwish? What about [Diabulus in Musica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzPESD5GGig)?"
"New single from Sleeping Romance: ""Fire and Ice""","I like my men to sound like men or women.  I like my women to sound like men.  With one exception: Epica.  Nightwish I am not incredibly fond of, no, but they are also one of the better ones.  

Best examples would be Triosphere and Dark Moor for those manly women.  Never listened to Unleash the Archers.  Diabulus in Musica's female vocalist sounds a lot like Simone Simons, but not as nice."
"New single from Sleeping Romance: ""Fire and Ice""","What about something like [MindMaze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC-GsMPLsgg)?

* **Winterage**: [The Harmonic Passage](http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Winterage/The_Harmonic_Passage/488630) - Symphonic Power Metal - February 2nd ([Preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF-2N9BJYgc))

*****  
###Fazermint's recommendation of the week  
Lots of releases this week, lots of variety. First off, I would like to recommend **Winterage**, which I somehow missed last week. It's Luca Turilli-esque Symphonic Power, and it sounds very awesome. The preview track has a slight overuse of high-pitched screams though.

As for this week's releases, I recommend checking out **Tanagra**, **Adrenaline Mob**, and **Lords of the Trident**. Tanagra sounds like a very interesting debut album, and that album art is GORGEOUS. Adrenaline Mob is recommended for fans of Russel Allen. This EP seems to be a mix of a few tracks from their previous album along with some new cover songs. Eh, why not? Lastly, Lords of the Trident should definitely be checked out. The album art is cool, and the lyric video has tons of explosions and flames. Oh, and the song is cool.

Are you interested in writing weekly release threads on a rotational basis? Let me know!"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","I love The Devil went Down to Georgia! The original one, [this metal one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgQQ3ZVYXeA) and now Adrenaline Mob one is freaking great too!

Also I can feel a little bit of neoclassical power metal like [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMpF3PFgKIk) in Destiny so i'm looking forward to it.

Intro to Megora - Countdown to black kinda remind's me of Silent Hill, but the rest is just, meh.

Lords of the Trident - Winds of the Storm is just masterpiece and I can't wait for entire album. I hope that it'll be as good as this single.

And you can't expect much from a band that call their album ""We are Metalheads""."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","[MFW seeing that ""We are Metalheads"" was an actual album title](http://i734.photobucket.com/albums/ww341/lashunda84/2zpr3ue.gif)"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","Been a busy weekend, thus why you get a review on Monday

**Beyond Reason:** This is what we call ""Tape Trading Quality"". Not sure if that's on purpose or not. Otherwise, this is a solid song, although it feels like I've heard it somewhere before. *worth a listen, if you can get past the audio quality*

**Uncertain Furtue:** I'm feeling the USPM style in the vein of Warning-Era Queensryche, right down to the vocals. Excellent stuff here for sure *Fans of USPM will get a kick out of this one*

**Tanagra:** No Darmok and Jilad? Bad Star Trek reference aside, this looks awesome (album cover wise). It's a toe-tapper for sure, although I'm not a fan of the growling vocals, they seem out of place for me on this song. *mild interest to hear more material, saddened on there being no Star Trek puns*

**Adreniline Mob:** A band I always describe as ""If Russel Allen sang for Black Label Society"". Really wasn't keen on this song. After hearing the Guitar Hero version, this version pales in comparison. Even Russell Allen feels just ""there"" on this one. *listen once, then forget about it*

**Aldious:** The /u/unlosthorizon special I see. I'm never a huge fan of lyrics in a different language, but I couldn't get over how much I liked the stage presense they had. Also, the music is catchy and well played, even in a live setting. My only gripe is the last minute or so. All I thought of was Frozen, which made me groan. *highly recommended, even if you're not a fan of Japanese Power Metal*

**Destiny:** Such a generic name, could you not add a Dragon, Hammer or Blood in there? Music wise, loving the instruments, hated the vocals. Liked the clean stuff, then it was garbled yelling and I was soured on this band. *looking forward to more material, but man, those vocals...* 

**Manilla Road:** I'm surprised they still made music. Granted, I'm not as educated on my Manilla Road history (I should fix that...). I was digging the gritty sound, but was not digging the fact it wasn't a full song. *You had my curiousity, now you have my attention*

**Lappalainen:** With a name like that, knew it would be folk metal. Heard it, hated the vocals. Harsh and grating. Sounds generic for its genre. *Avoidable*

**Born of Fire:** Visually, did not like the vocalist. Musically, these guys are solid. They could have cut down some of the song (like the slow keyboard part) and it would be much more enjoyable. Felt they could have used more power to their sound, but maybe that's just me. *worth a listen, perhaps multiple*

**Megora:** At times I thought I was listening to old Godsmack, which isn't all a bad thing, but it feels generic for metal. *not recommended*

**Lords of the Trident:** 45 seconds in and I'm headbanging away. That's a good song right there. I felt the solo was slightly lacking (at first) but picks up in a hurry. Even the lyrics are great, despite being drenched in fantasy. *Listen to this to start your day off right*

**Grey Wolf:** It was over before it began. Kind of just there really. Although it ended suddenly which I found odd. Nothing wrong with this, just forgettable *skippable*

**Winterage:** Sounds like Rhapsody of Fire? Must be from Italy. Quick look say yup, I am correct. So with that, it's standard Rhapsody of Fire fare in the vein of Frozen Tears of Angels/Power of the Dragonflame. *My recommendation for the week*"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","There is a plethora of amazing black metal, i'll have you know!

"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","I'm pretty sure [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsXlzf0NkAc) must be on the extremely crappy end. Accidentally listened to it because the band was classified as Black Metal (early), Power Metal (later), and they had a release last week. Little did I know it was a re-issue of an earlier black metal album. Guy sounds like he's puking and the song makes me want to kill myself. I get that people like unclean vocals, but I find it hard to believe that anyone listening to this think ""this is pleasant to my ears"". But what the hell do I know, 80% of the releases on the Metal Archives have unclean vocals so apparently that's what's popular nowadays."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","Yes that is at the extremely crappy end.

For a power metal aficionado, I would recommend 3rd wave stuff as a gateway. Stuff like [Keep of Kalessin - Ascendant](http://youtu.be/TTXfrFEI93U), [Saturnian - Shadow Of Prophecy](http://youtu.be/sQtjJjhzj0k), or heck even [Dimmu Borgir - Dimmu Borgir](http://youtu.be/2c7cG91RbIM) "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","I've only listened to Dimmu Borgir so far but this is the first time I've enjoyed anything close to black metal. I'm gonna have to save your post so I can check out the rest later."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","Never used to listen to black metal...you gave me faith in the genre.

Dimmu Borgir are fucking badasses, and the other two are great too, although Saturnian aren't really my style; vocals are a little too harsh.

I really fucking liked DB though."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","*cough* [Misþyrming - Söngvar elds og óreiðu](http://misthyrming.bandcamp.com/releases) *cough*
"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","Now, at first I was expecting huge, skyscraper-high text in the recommendations section reading ""Manilla Road"". Then I listened to the preview and understood the lack of mention of them.

Darmok approves of Tanagra. As it happens, I do as well. Nice recommendation! Will have to check them out when the album releases.

As to the Black Metal business I have to ask: Is it depicting you pressing a button causing your own demise due to despair or is the picture depicting the obliteration of your very being by the soul-crushing Black Metal booming out of your speakers?"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","That would be the former. If there's one thing people know about me, it's that I can't stand unclean vocals. I don't usually make a big fuss about it, but that one particular song I listened to by accident (link in my reply to Mushmancat) was just so repugnant and disturbing that I almost lose sleep over it."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","Yeah this is pretty disturbing, I can't fault you for your response in the least. That's a minute of my life I won't be getting back ever again."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","Had a shit week but here I am, [ready for some more metal](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/077/988/my_body_is_ready.png)!

**Beyond Reason: A New Reflection** - Alright, so this is kind of amazing, I mean, the production is bad but this is some seriously good USPM. I guess I'll have to try and find more from these guys. Definitely worth a check.

**Uncertain Future: Shock the System** - This immediately throws me back to the 80s style of power metal and definitely reminded me of Fifth Angel. I don't really like the song, maybe it's the vocals or maybe it's the weird ass production.

**Tanagra: None of This is Real** - The album immediately caught my eye (the left one) because it's rare to see purple tones in power metal albums, it's usually used in the more depressive/angry realms of metal. The lyrics sort of reflect the style and makes me wonder if the rest of the album is as pessimistic as this song. The song itself is good but the intro is just bland and boring and it would be better if it just start right off with the riff, even worse the intro melody is reincorporated later in the song. Cool chorus.

**Adrenaline Mob: Dearly Departed** - Cool cover song, don't have an opinion on this one. Just give it a shot.

**Aldious: Live Tour 2014 ""Dazed and Delight""～Live at Club Citta'～** - This wouldn't have been half as bad if anyone knew how to fucking sing. The bassist is one odd cookie.

**Destiny: Time** - This song is very rich in instrumentation, there is always something going on and everything is filled and packed. However, the vocals are a bit too wild, he changes tone very quickly and I wonder if it's something I could get accustomed to. This one is worth your time and repeated listens.

**Manilla Road: The Blessed Curse** - It's Manilla Road so you have to check out. Unrelated: Does anyone know if there will ever be another HellWell release? That was some awesome stuff.

**Lappalainen: Kraken's Awakening** - Sounds Finnish right? They're french... Although a very odd folk song, this is very enjoyable and was very fun to listen too, the folk seems to be delivered by only a flute which I think is really awesome. If you're into some rough folk stuff, it might be for you.

**Born of Fire: Dead Winter Sun** - Now get this... the vocalist name is... Gordon Tittsworth.... Back to the song, I am 100% positive there is a very good 3/near 4 minute song in this 6 minute song, the slower parts although are done well, they just seem to hold back the song and ends up becoming plod-ish.

**Megora: Burning Empire** - Uninspired and boring.

**Lords of the Trident: Frostburn** - Cool meat and potatoes song.

**Grey Wolf: We are Metalheads** - What a bad album a name. The song pays homage to old school traditional heavy metal. Galloping riff style song. It stops very abruptly, weird...

What *I* may have missed last week but really didn't

**Winterage: The Harmonic Passage** - I heard this album a few times already and I definitely recommend to anyone interested in symphonic stuff. It's far from perfect but there are some very interesting songs, I personally recommend ""Golden Worm"".

Cool week, some very interesting songs, quietly waiting for the Nightwish release.

"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","Reggie is a beautiful, beautiful man.

I'm looking forward to digging into Tanagra's release, but I'm prepared for a medium-to-kinda-good album. I feel like ""Tyranny of Time"" could have been a lot better if it had some better riffs. I'm more excited about the album art than the album itself, tbh. But who knows, we might be positively surprised.

I was really weirded out by Lappalainen being French. Folk metal is pretty big in Finland, did they give their band a Finnish name to appeal to that crowd?"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","Destiny sounds interesting (but could they have gone with a more generic band and album name? Googling this is futile).

Also Roberto Tiranti is a guest vocalist! Definitely going to give this a listen. "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","I expect you found their [Bandcamp](https://destinycr.bandcamp.com/releases) page by now?"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","Yeah I found that page, my initial comment wanted to focus on their generic name, not my shitty googling skills. :p"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","Good to know, at least now it's easily available for others who are trying to narrow down the generic name."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","You're right about that, I had to search for ""destiny band time"" instead of just ""destiny time"". "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","[This may help narrow your search](http://www.metal-archives.com/)"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/9 - 2/15)","I'm definitely picking up the Lords of the Trident album. Their song ""Winds of the Storm"" is amazing; I hope the rest of the album is the same or better! 
"
"HammerFall - One More Time",""
"HammerFall - One More Time","Didn't rate this album at the time but there are a few redeeming qualities. "
"HammerFall - One More Time","I still don't like Infected at all, but rEvolution turned out to be powerful again, so can't wait to see them live in the summer!"
"HammerFall - One More Time","So, this mini-rant isn't completely directed at you, but I thought I'd bring it up here, since maybe you can answer it. :D

I'm interested in why people don't like Infected... I mean, it *has* to be the gimmick, right? Like, the instrumentation is the best on Infected of all the HammerFall albums, but they have this theme of life and death which is all anchored by the zombie motif. And I guess people don't like that they're not singing about Templars, and that Hector isn't on the cover? I have to think that people don't like Infected because it's different (not musically, not even really lyrically, but just with the look).

I didn't start listening to HammerFall until sometime after Infected came out, so I've never known a HammerFall without Infected. As such, I think I have a little bit less biased of opinion on it. I can understand why someone would dislike the change in direction, but I think that now that it's in the past, people should take another look and realize that it's an awesome album with a silly gimmick."
"HammerFall - One More Time","HammerFall is a band that people don't like in general after their first couple of records. I think they're a band that people take a little too seriously, and end up missing a lot of the fun they offer. I understand that they've been on a gradual decline up to and including Infected, but I still enjoy all of it.

The reason Infected garners so much hate is twofold. Firstly, the new imagery and themes led to a ton of people who only liked the first two HammerFall records to check them out again, and then they found out that the band really is getting worse. The other reason is because the imagery is a bit of a slap in the face to the longtime fans. There are a lot of really great songs on this album, and many HammerFall classics IMO, but there's also a ton of stuff that just doesn't work at all.  "
"HammerFall - One More Time","First of all, i'm not a die-hard HF fan, i've been listening to them during the years on and off, never saw them live (it's gonna change this summer tho) and i'm by no means used to writing music reviews (even less so in English language), so keep that in mind. But on the other hand, this is the band that got me in listening to metal in the first place.

For me, the first new album which came out after I discovered them was No Sacrifice, No Victory and I thought it was a bit weaker, you know, if you look back at last one, Threshold, it is pretty much just a fast-paced power storm thrusted in your face. NSNV got in my eyes (or ears) more complicated, more tempo changes and surely me personally being overhyped about the whole thing did play a role. Later I got used to the new sound more and the moment I realised I do not have anything against NSNV anymore was when Infected came out. 

Infected just doesn't *work* for me. I have a pretty dull programming job, after each day of it I just need to get in the car, turn the key and have a couple of flaming hammers wielding dragons fly me in a finger four formation home. The more over-the-top, the better. You know, to start up my brain again, give me some energy. This is all I need from power metal. 

I think the reason Infected doesn't make me happy is that it doesn't have any BIG song, you know that one or two which just shovels the feeling of power in your face and tell you to eat it, like Secrets, Genocide, One of a Kind, or thing like Origins from rEvolution which is in my opinion partially some kind of inner joke in the terms of how over the top POWER the lyrics are (I have to say laughed when I heard them rhyme ""on"" three times in a single verse), but that doesn't matter for some reason, it works for me.

On Infected closest to this comes I'd say The Outlaw, which starts great, but when you expect some glorious chorus to blow you further in your seat, the tempo just slows down and melodies get technical and this is I think pretty much the definition of the whole album.

Most of the songs would perfectly fit in a HF album, but there needs to be *something more* accompanying them is what was wrong with Infected I'd say. "

*****  
###Fazermint's ultra-biased opinions  

* **Winterage**: This band is what Twilight Force should have been: A RoF-inspired blast of symphonic goodness. We will probably never see the return of the glory days of RoF and symphonic power metal, but this album goes a long way to sate that hunger for something classic, yet entirely new. The album is pretty long: 69 minutes. It could easily have been shorter if all the filler intro/interludes were cut, which would have made the album more compact. The title track has become one of my favorite symphonic power metal tracks, with great melodies, orchestral instrumentation (primarily violins, goes for the whole album), and good vocals. The song would be perfect if it weren't for those unnecessary high-pitched squeals here and there, which goes to show that the album is largely based on inspirations from the genre and has little creativity and innovation.  
That said, the album is very dynamic, with each song being notably different from each other. ""The Flame Shall not Fade"" is a 7-minute long, generally slow-paced song with a few faster segments that changes things up often enough to create an enticing whole. ""Wirewings"" is more traditional, in the sense of being shorter and faster-paced, and has a nifty melody. ""Golden Worm"" is one of the strongest tracks on the album, with rock-solid instrumentation and a smashing chorus. ""Crown to the Crowds"" is a pretty standard, but decent track, and ""The Endless Well"" is pretty amazing if you don't mind the opera vocals.  
**TL;DR**: *The Harmonic Passage* has some of the nicest symphonic power metal tracks I've heard in a while. The album is largely based on inspirations from the genre and has little creativity and innovation. It also suffers from some poor pacing because of filler tracks. Score: **8/10**.  
* **Wind Rose**: Behind this awful name hides a manly-man power metal band. Something that is not evident in ""Rebel and Free"" is that the vocalist sounds pretty damn much like Russell Allen. And that, my friends, is a *good* thing. ""Rebel and Free"" is more chant-based, and the vocalist sounds nothing like Russell Allen using this vocal style. The slow intro that is in the video is not present on the album, but sadly the sudden pause in the middle is. The song itself is pretty fantastic, with hard-hitting drums and guitar riffs backed by melodic elements. Other songs equally worthy of the title *song of the month* are ""Age of Conquest"" and ""Born in the Cradle of Storms"", both in which the incredible Russel Allen likeness is apparent. None of these two are up on YouTube, but maybe you can find them elsewhere. As for the rest of the album, it is incredibly good throughout. It is delightfully heavy, the vocals and chants are fantastic, and it has enchanting melodic elements. I know ""The Breed of Durin"" is on YT, so check it out because it's another fantastic track.  
**TL;DR**: This is easily the **album of the month**. Look up every track you possibly can from this album. Score: **10/10**.  
* **Tanagra**: Tanagra's debut album caught my attention quickly, in part because of its album art. The song used to promote the album was ""Tyranny of Time"", which went a long way to get me excited for the album. It was by no means an exceptional track, but it did sound like solid power metal to me. The vocals are more than good enough, and the chorus was pretty damn amazing. The guitar riff was a bit repetitive, perhaps, but I thought it worked well enough. The guitar solo showcased that they did know how to riff properly. So yes, I was intrigued. The sound quality is at a low 128kbps, which is somewhat understandable for a debut album, but certainly not desirable in the year of 2015. After getting my hands on the album, I was delighted to hear that the opening track, ""The Undying Light"", was even better than ""Tyranny of Time"". Nice and fast, recipe-based but solid, soaring vocals, and a smashing chorus. The guitar solo is even sicker than in ""Tyranny of Time"", as well. The kick in the face, though, is that the rest of the album is quite forgettable.  
**TL;DR**: Couple of sweet tracks on an otherwise forgettable album; production quality is sub-par. Score: **6/10**.  
* **Lords of the Trident**: It is always cool when the singer (or any other member of the band, for that matter) hangs out on /r/PowerMetal. Shoutout to /u/mshabooboo for putting out a more-than-solid album! Now, some people (including myself) has called this a *fun* album. If you have witnessed any of the disastrous Gloryhammer discussions on here, you know that's a no-no. *This album is not good because it's fun*. I don't think anybody thinks so (although that's what gets taken away from our comments). *It is good in its own right*. The *fun* factor comes with the overall light-hearted vibe of the music, and the [personalities of the band members](https://wudmusic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/lordsofthetrident.jpg).  
Onto the actual album, this is a Heavy / Power Metal album. The instrumentation is generally fast-paced, and the vocal style is definitely inspired by power metal. I had a hard time picking a favorite track from this album, mainly between ""Knights of Dragon's Deep"" and ""Winds of the Storm"". Out of those two, /u/mshabooboo's favorite is ""Knights of Dragon's Deep"", perhaps because it is easier to sing for him. He likened singing ""Winds of the Storm"" to a *weightlifting marathon while being chased by rabid cheetahs*. Well, that settled it for me, ""Winds of the Storm"" is my favorite. If you're still not sold on the album after hearing these two tracks, I can also recommend ""Kill to Die"" as one of the most power metal-y tracks. The whole album is solid, anyway.  
**TL;DR**: Awesome Heavy / Power with a talented vocalist, a consistently good album. Score: **8/10**.  
* **Nocturna**: This was a nice little EP that I feel needs some more attention. It is their first EP, and they have yet to produce a full album. This EP shows a lot of promise. Nice and fast instrumentation, symphonic support, and interesting vocals. The vocalist has a slightly boyish voice, but I think it works well with the music. He is definitely talented. The EP has 4 tracks (excluding intro and interlude), three of which are normal length (5ish minutes) and one that is a 10-minute long semi-ballad track that switches pace every minute because it wouldn't be a power metal production otherwise ;_;  
The title track is awesome, with hard-hitting instrumentation and soaring vocals. They've made a music video of ""Revelation"", which is definitely worth checking out (dat mouth synchronization tho). ""Gaining Solace"" is another excellent track, though not to the extent of the aforementioned tracks.  
**TL;DR**: A nice little EP that shows tons of promise. Hurry and make a full album, guys! Score: **7/10**

###Non-PM spotlight  
* **Adrenaline Mob**: *Dearly Departed* (EP) - [Gets You Through the Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-D-b83tMr4&amp;t=5s) (Hard Rock / Groove Metal). Adrenaline Mob is a supergroup fronted by the hero Russell Allen, and they've been active for some years now. This EP is built around a song that is in no way new - it was featured on their latest full album. So why this EP exists is beyond me. Anyway, the EP does feature some new tracks, most of which are cover songs, and they're all right. The star of the EP, in my eyes, is ""Gets you Through the Night"", which was previously only released as a Japanese bonus track. And it's pretty awesome! Its incredible energy and smooth rhythm makes it one of my favorite tracks so far for 2015. Score: **7/10**.  
* **Eclipse**: *Armageddonize* - [Stand on your Feet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r453Xtjn6bA) (Hard Rock). Eclipse is one of the best hard rock act out there. They have taken the hard rock genre and perfected it. Everything the made the genre awesome in the old days is present, just in a modern package sounding tons better. They had 2 or 3 albums from the early 2000's, which were complete crap. Then they re-invented themselves in 2008 with immensely improved recording quality and songwriting. Vocalist and producer Erik Mårtensson has an amazing voice. The album has received perfect 10/10's all over the internet, but as much as I wanted this album to be perfect - it isn't. Their previous album *Bleed and Scream* may have been worthy of a perfect score, but I'm gonna have to give *Armageddonize* a score of **9/10**.

"Fazermint's favorite Power Metal releases: February","Winterage is ambitious yet low-budget and I think what they've achieved deserves a big round of applause. Really enjoyable symphonic power metal. Good on them their passion shows."
"Fazermint's favorite Power Metal releases: February","Just curious, how many times did you listen to these albums before reaching a verdict on their score? 

I've only listened to Tanagra out of these albums, and I agree with your assessment of it. Thought ""Tyranny of Time"" was really good while the rest was forgettable. ""The Undying Light"" was at first with the forgettable group but after couple more listens it has become... less forgettable. But I'm going to give the album another go to see if it turns out any better. 

I'm surprised by your perfect score for Wind Rose. While I liked the promotional song, it didn't quite sell me on the album. However I listened to ""The Breed of Durin"" due to this thread and I thought it was much better. So, I'm definitely going to check out the album someday soon. Winterage too. "
"Fazermint's favorite Power Metal releases: February","Hm, I think I end up listening at least 3 times to an album. Also, I wouldn't take my scores overly serious. Wind Rose is the best album I've heard this year, hence the 10/10. Perhaps a tad generous, idk. I think I tend to be generous rather than strict with the scores (maybe to compensate for the dismissive nature of my band writeups). In any case, the album is amazing."
"Persuader - Aftermath - [4:00]",""
"Civil War - Rome is Falling",""
"Civil War - Rome is Falling","That chorus got me hooked for days."
"Civil War - Rome is Falling","That was pretty sweet"
"Civil War - Rome is Falling","Oh shit! It's the singer from Richard Anderson's Space Odyssey "
"Civil War - Rome is Falling","Not bad but honestly they should have stuck with Sabaton. The singer is what saves the song, even though I liked him better in Wuthering Heights."
"Heavily orchestrated epics?","I'm looking for other songs that are heavily orchestrated epic pieces (or have heavy classical influences) - preferably with LOTS of time signature changes, dynamics, classically influenced, etc. Generally they're longer songs (10+ minutes), and have a capella parts, orchestral parts, opera parts, solo instrumental parts (organ/piano/etc), and good old metal.

A perfect example is **The Odyssey** by Symphony X. Others include:

* **Judgment Day** - Aquaria
* **Choice Time** - Aquaria
* **Darkness and Starlight** - Black Mages
* **Dies Irae** - Dark Moor
* **The Moon** - Dark Moor
* **Of Wars in Osyrhia** - Fairyland
* **Ghost Love Score** - Nightwish
* **Queen of the Dark Horizons** - Rhapsody
* **Symphony of Enchanted Lands** - Rhapsody
* **The Accolade** - Symphony X
* **The Divine Wings of Tragedy** - Symphony X
* **The Odyssey** - Symphony X"

"Heavily orchestrated epics?","Whole bunch of Therion and Queen.

Also, the Michael Kamen influence on Metallica S&amp;M definitely adds many of the elements you're looking form. Specifically Call of Ktulu"
"Heavily orchestrated epics?","Awesome. I love epics like these and look forward to finding more. "
"Heavily orchestrated epics?","A lot of the Therion stuff is very orchestra influenced, they even did an album where they collaborated with an entire Orchestra to play classical songs and some of their material.
The CD / DVD is called The Miskolc Experience  and I love the whole show.
Here is the trailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulIF1ysSpLc&amp;index=17&amp;list=PL524ECCC6519C80C4

And this (imo) is the best song of the show -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPYpKJlFq7Y

And I really love Turisas ""End of an Empire"" the chorus starting at 5:35 might be better then bad break up sex.

"Anyone else start singing (or playing music) after listening to power metal for a while?","I've never been much of a singer, but been a fan of power metal for years, even when I was the only person I knew who listened to it. After listening to it for some time I began to try to sing some of my favorite songs because I wanted to see if I could sing like they do. While I don't really like to sing in front of people I've started to really like singing just for myself and I've been told I'm good at it. I never would have started if it wasn't for power metal. Anyone else have a similar story?"

"Anyone else start singing (or playing music) after listening to power metal for a while?","Haha hell yeah love that song! "
"Anyone else start singing (or playing music) after listening to power metal for a while?","I do roughly the same thing, but usually with Elvenkind. I suspect my roommate secretly hates me for it, but he has yet to say anything. "
"Anyone else start singing (or playing music) after listening to power metal for a while?","I was in a band in middle school that played Tool covers. I was the singer. This was ~1999/2000ish. I thought I knew how to sing.

Enter power metal (I discovered it in 2001). That's really what turned me on to the great singers of the world. That said, I always thought those type of vocals was something I couldn't do, so I gravitated more towards growly-melodic-death metal stuff (even though I was never really into that type of music) and was in more bands covering that type of music (In Flames, Arch Enemy, Dark Tranquillity, etc.).

A few years back, I had some vocal chord problems and now I can't growl *at all*. Like, literally can't scream or growl no matter how much I try. So I focused on developing my clean voice more and, at the urging of an ex-girlfriend who was a *phenomenal* singer, started teaching myself to sing power metal. Lots of DVDs, met with her vocal teacher, etc. I realized that singing really is something anyone can do with enough practice. I also really need to put some covers up (once I move out of this apartment. . .I need some actual recording space).

On the other hand, I've been playing drums for ~18 years and I think power metal probably dumbed down my drumming =P. I first started studying jazz and stuff and now I just want to double-bass and play Sonata Arctica beats all day. 

Been playing guitar for ~12 years. Power metal definitely helped there. Completely self-taught.

Bought a keyboard on a whim ~3 years ago just to dick around. Nearly everything I know is power metal (Twilightning, Cain's Offering, Sonata Arctica, etc.).

This seems like the type of genre where most people are musicians. I'd be amazed if the majority of /r/powermetal didn't play at least one instrument and/or sang."

I first started studying jazz and stuff and now I just want to double-bass and play Sonata Arctica beats all day.

I can relate. Been playing drums for about six years (you already know I'm pretty young), and nowadays I'd rather play a Sonata Arctica or Sabaton track than play something more complex like Seventh Wonder or Symphony X (although one of my favorite accomplishments is learning ""The Odyssey"" over the summer)."
"Anyone else start singing (or playing music) after listening to power metal for a while?","&gt; one of my favorite accomplishments is learning ""The Odyssey"" over the summer

I binge-listened to it for a week to learn all the lyrics as quick as I could - nothing is better than a 24-minute car ride and a sore throat afterward.  Totally worth it, every time."
"Anyone else start singing (or playing music) after listening to power metal for a while?","Guitarist/drummer/piano player here

having played many instruments is one of the reasons I shied away from more mainstream genres, their focus is completely away from instrumental depth."

"Anyone else start singing (or playing music) after listening to power metal for a while?","I just remind myself that my favorite vocalist, Mathias Blad, didn't record anything with Falconer until he was 28.

There's always time :-)"
"Anyone else start singing (or playing music) after listening to power metal for a while?","Yeah, definitely started singing because of power metal.  Been told I am good by people as well.  Probably will upload covers here in the future once I can get my hand on a decent mic."
"Anyone else start singing (or playing music) after listening to power metal for a while?","Yea, i also started to sing, but the truth is that i can't. I also bought myself a keyboard but it turned out that i can't do that too. Sad, isn't it?"

"Anyone else start singing (or playing music) after listening to power metal for a while?","I can't sing for my life, let alone epic power metal. I do play and study guitar religiously though and shred daily. I aspire to write epic power metal, but there's too many obstacles like writing for the other instruments..."
"Anyone else start singing (or playing music) after listening to power metal for a while?","I can say that people are surprised at the stuff I can belt out in karaoke if they have power metal songs.

When I went to japan for a while...karaoke like every week with people so I could sing the huge PM selection. They would never have that amount of stuff anywhere over here.

SA's Fullmoon was my go-to karaoke thing :P"
"Anyone else start singing (or playing music) after listening to power metal for a while?","Somewhat. I started because of Rocksmith and singing along to [Nirvana's In Bloom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbgKEjNBHqM). ""Whoa! I can sing the high notes! I better see a vocal coach"". I just started listening to power metal, and loved it, so I tried that genre

Things I found:

1. Power metal is high. [I tried to sing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZJw19uFQ18) but had lots of trouble
2. It's best to be a tenor. Some signs is if your voice has a naturally light timber. If you have a deep voice and can't speak loudly, you might not speak in your voice's best pitch. 
3. Baritones are common in rock, but not in power metal. It's dominated by tenors, tenor being the highest range for males. This may explain why there's a lot of women in power metal, but not other kinds of metal
4. Nirvana is baritone, so when my voice got stronger, In Bloom ended up not being high at all
5. Because of how high power metal is, I had to start out with alternative rock
6. Not only power metal has a lot of tenors, a lot of songs go above the normal tenor range.
7. A lot of power metal vocalists have training in the classic music style. It's actually a good idea to find someone skilled in opera or the classic music style if you are going to take lessons. [You'll find quite a few power metal singers you never expect to be able to sing well in those settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9neDIowyhaA)
8. I can sing Promised Land now
9. Van Canto is a good band to start out with

Some bands like Sabaton have baritones. "

"DragonForce - Three Hammers (Official Video)","My favorite song off the latest album.

"DragonForce - Three Hammers (Official Video)","I'm wondering, Is there any reason a lot of bands are recording their live videos\albums in Japan?"
"DragonForce - Three Hammers (Official Video)","Dragonforce their reputation isn't what it used to be in western countries, but with the collab with Baby Metal, their popularity in Japan raised a lot. It's mainly the audience that is absolutely great for these live albums."

EDIT: Wow, a ""live"" clip from a ""live DVD"" with the studio version over top of it.  DragonForce, no, pls.

EDIT 2: God, I shouldn't post when it's this late.  So they say it's strictly a video clip from the DVD with the studio version of the song over it, the implication being that the DVD will have the live version and that this is the music video.

"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","[Seemingly confirmed by their facebook account's hints](https://www.facebook.com/kamelotofficial/photos/a.125526028002.104540.77696833002/10152838900818003/?type=1&amp;theater)

I'm excited about this. I would've liked for Seventh Wonder to get their new album out (or at least have Tommy have all his stuff done) before all his time and effort went into another Kamelot album + touring schedule, but I'll take his vocals however I can get them. Silverthorn is tied with Epica for my favorite Kamelot album, and Tommy's performance has a lot to do with that, so this is definitely something I've been anticipating!

Basically, this news is [...](http://i.imgur.com/8Xa9OMb.gif)!

"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","I just heard that Andreas Blomqvist's family just had their second child, so I'm not sure how much time he's had to write...he seems to be one of the driving forces behind that band..."
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","Silverthorn was october 2012 and now we get Haven. The Great Escape was 2010 and we STILL dont have a release date for the new SW.... its a bittersweet feeling."
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","SW?"
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","Seventh Wonder :) a.k.a the greatest prog/power band in the world."
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","Link your 3 favorite songs for me =D"
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","Well, first off we have [Destiny Calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wy8B42G3vQ), really  great intro and fantastic vocals. Then we have [One Last Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEK9-9emkEA), a really beautiful ballad (Tommy is seriously amazing with ballads). And finally, the greatest song i have ever heard. I recommend you sit down with the lyrics and actually listen through it, cause it is really worth it. [The Great Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMjO7y-98Ak) Its 30 minutes but there isnt one wasted minute."
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","I'd recommend listening to their album 'Mercy Falls' in full, beginning to end for the greatest impact. The first two songs max linked actually come towards the end of that, and have some pretty big spoilers for the story of the album."
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","Can't wait. Kamelot is my favorite band, and this will be the first album of theirs I'll be present for upon release."
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","I am scared..."
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","I'm really excited, but I'm really waiting on my favorite band Seventh Wonder to put out another masterpiece... Although, if Haven will be like anything like Silverthorn or better, I'd be very happy! "
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","So the song titles presented by Youngblood and this website...it looks like the new album is another concept album, this time with a dystopian theme. Anyone else seeing this?"
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","I'm hoping that with this album we can see karevik's vocals becoming more like his own style, rather than the material for Silverthorn which sounded like it was written for Khan (and from what I've heard it was)"
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","My understanding is that the instrumentals were already written, and Tommy wrote his own melodies. While I imagine Tommy being better integrated into the band will have the music being written more with his voice in mind, I don't think it will, nor should, result in Tommy using something reflecting his Seventh Wonder vocal style. Kamelot has its sound, and Seventh Wonder has its sound - these are rather distinct for various reasons, so Tommy going in with a style better suited for a very proggy band wouldn't really work.

Tommy had to bend his voice to work with the Kamelot's already established sound, and I think that worked well on Silverthorn. People say he became a Khan-clone or whatever, but I don't see that at all. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTjaSGeypZ4) is what a Khan-clone sounds like. I imagine many of the same people would be complaining and saying that Tommy ruined the band if he went with a Seventh Wonder-style. "
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","My problem with Karevik on Silverthorn wasn't that he didn't sound enough like he does on Seventh Wonder, it's just that he didn't seem to be really singing like he wanted to. He puts a lot of emotion into his Seventh Wonder work just like how khan put a lot of emotion into his kamelot work and I felt like that was missing on Silverthorn. 
That said I still think that his singing was really good, just not as good as it could have been."
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","This is a matter of subjectivity and perception, so all I can say to that is that I thought Tommy matched even Khan's more emotional moments with his performance on Silverthorn."
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","Really hate that the album is coming out after my live date. They will undoubtedly play some new material, and live shows are so loud and bassy that it's really difficult to hear the music if you don't know it already, so the new songs will be wasted on me.  :("
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","I may be in the minority, but Silverthorn didn't light my world on fire like previous Kamelot albums have (not since Ghost Opera, but still) so I'm a tad skeptical on what it'll be like."
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","Alright, I'm a bit late to this party, but I've got a theory. 

Kamelot's album quality follows a sine-wave-like pattern. They started off low with their first vocalist. Khan signed up and they started to improve, hitting their peak somewhere around Epica or The Black Halo. Then they started getting worse going to ""solid but not great"" with Ghost Opera and hitting their lowest point at Poetry for the Poisoned. Now that Tommy's on board, we're starting to go into an upswing. Silverthorn was to Kaverik as Karma or The Fourth Legacy was to Khan. 

It's all uphill from here guys. Nothing bad's ever gonna happen again with Kamelot. 

***Nothing bad. Ever again***"
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","Very excited to hear more Kamelot, especially with Tommy. Silverthorn really grew on me over time. I don't love the cover or the title, feels a little too goth, but I'm holding out hope."
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","Seems pretty legit. Hard to get too excited though, they've not delivered with Silverthorn and Poetry for the Poisoned IMHO. "
"New Kamelot album (Haven) details (artwork in comments)","I think it's really exciting, even though I didn't like silverthorn. "

"Ascension - MOONGATE. Ascension &gt; Sharky Sharky","It's the same band. Most of the members from Ascension went on to make Sharky Sharky."
"Ascension - MOONGATE. Ascension &gt; Sharky Sharky","Oh alrighty then. Carry on. "
"Ascension - MOONGATE. Ascension &gt; Sharky Sharky","Can we agree that there needs to be more of both?

"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","I don't know how about you, but It's kinda boring. I liked Ravenhead and F.E.V.E.R but the rest of album is just... Nothing special."
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","Super deluxe mini track review GO!

**Orden Ogan** - Pointless intro, boring, filler

**Ravenhead** - Had potential but it's way too long, had it been shorter, it could be a good intro to the album with some good ol' standard meat and potatoes power metal

**F.E.V.E.R** - Cool song, i hate the chorus but that's probably just me, it also irritates me that they repeat the chorus so many times in particular in the slow beginning of the song. It's actually a good song, some good variations in the middle.

**The Lake** - Nothing special, average song, guitars seem to be buried in the chorus.

**Evil Lies in Every Man** - Sick song. Well executed.

**Here at the End of the World** - Gosh darn i like this song but i can't figure out who is singing as guest on this one. It's so familiar... Possibly a crowd chanting style of song.

**A Reason To Give** - a shit, i cannot. A ballad style song, it's boring. I yawned. Next.

**Deaf Among The Blind** - Fast ripping song. It's another good song.

**Sorrow Is Your Tale** - Hmmm, is that Cans? I think I hear him here... Might have spend too many time listening to some black metal in the past two weeks. Sweet intro to kick off the tune leading to the strongest chorus in the album. Awesome song to play live.

**In Grief And Chains** - Pointless, I don't know what this is.

**Too Soon** - Pointless outro, boring, filler

All performances are good, there are no weak links, the vocalist is definitely above average. It's a decent album but I am seeing quite a few reviews online praising how amazing this album is. Cmon it's just the typical power metal songs that heavily relies on the catchiness and quality of chorus and such stuff, which are the best part of the album.

All this was based on my first listening, I don't see this growing on me over time, so this is just an album with some bad moments and some good songs. Sorrow Is Your Tale stands out."
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","&gt; Here at the End of the World - Gosh darn i like this song but i can't figure out who is singing as guest on this one. It's so familiar... Possibly a crowd chanting style of song.

Just listened to it (haven't purchased the album yet). I'm like 80% sure it's the vocalist from Grave Digger just based on his voice (I'm getting way too good at recognizing singers, I feel like some sort of idiot savant). I forget his name offhand because I hate Grave Digger.

^EDIT: Chris Boltendahl. Thanks Google.

This song is really good though."
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","&gt; because I hate Grave Digger

What :O"
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","Well, I can't say I don't understand why. Musically they can be pretty fantastic, but Boltendahl's voice is definitely an acquired taste. It took me  a number of years to get into it. And even now I still prefer [Rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fg-lbNhHfM), which is made up of some former Grave Digger members but has, in my opinion, vastly superior vocals."
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","Oh yeah that's him alright, was to lazy to look up."
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","I see many people saying that and they've got the right to say it. But for me, this album is incredible and delivers. Just as I expected. Well, maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit because Orden Ogan is nearly one of my favourite Power Metal bands but I love that album."
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","Need to get my hands on it, will do soon. I'm sad to hear it's disappointing, though. Fever and Ravenhead were sounding good... though Ravenhead got a lot of hate."
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","Definitely you. I was meaning to make a post saying how incredibly great it is. For me, the album is better than anything in 2014(and it was a good year) and best of Orden Ogan yet(and  their previous albums are great). There isn't one weak moment on the album for me.

Evil Lies In Every Man, F.E.V.E.R and Here At The End Of The World are highlights, being a bit more awesome then the rest.

Early candidate for album of the year for me."
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","Yeah, I was somewhat disappointed. Ravenhead is good, F.EV.E.R is okay but I don't like it that much. I like The Lake, Sorrow Is Your Tale and Too Soon, but everything else I found rather boring. Most of the tracks from To the End are far better than the best on Ravenhead, in my opinion."
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","I think it's actually really good. Certainly the first 5-6 songs are the best. I didn't think it was weak at all though. I'm not sure it was as good as To the End, but I liked it a lot."
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","Was waiting for a thread like this. I told myself I would try not to compare it to the masterpiece that is ""To The End"" but... not even that will salvage it. F.E.V.E.R is great, Ravenhead is almost great but pointlessly long. Evil Lies in Every Man is fantastic and Here at the End of the World is worth a few listens. 

Overall it's meh. After To The End I knew this album wouldn't be an improvement. I'm glad I have some new songs to throw on the ol' playlist but I won't be listening to it on repeat for years like To The End."
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","It's you. I think the album is great. But hey that's the beauty of music. It's very subjective. What you hear is different to what I hear. =) "
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","Yeah, its pretty mediocre. Sabaton fans will be blowing their nut over it though. "
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","Sabaton fanboy. Absolutely loved To The End. Got Ravenhead at 0.01on the 16th and listened to it like 5 times since. Really disappointed."
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","I like F.E.V.E.R alot and Ravenhead is okay, but the rest of the album is pretty much meh sadly. And i'm a Sabaton fan too by the way."
"Is it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?","Sabaton fan here, i agree, its a massive letdown. I think i will stick to ""To The End""

A much better album in my opinion"

"Scar Symmetry - Ghost Prototype II: Deus Ex Machina (you can't post one without the other)","Anytime this is posted in /r/progmetal someone usually points out how similar the intro is to the Count of Tuscany by Dream Theater, and it really is."
"Scar Symmetry - Ghost Prototype II: Deus Ex Machina (you can't post one without the other)","Yeah, that's incredible. Both are great songs too.

While we're on the topic of similar riffs and Christian Alvestam, I've got one of my own too.

"Scar Symmetry - Ghost Prototype II: Deus Ex Machina (you can't post one without the other)","I'm on mobile right now, so I'm sorry for not having any links, but there is another Solution .45 song that has a riff which is very similar to an Evergrey song. 

Listen to Through Night-kingdomed Gates by Solution .45 then listen to Blinded by Evergrey. The intro riff is almost identical to Evergrey's only it's a 7 string song instead of 6."

i know this prob a long shot but any ideas?"
"Looking for a song","I'm going to guess it was maybe [Wolfpack by Sabaton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fIDOC1qs6I) cos of the lyric ""To their own shore came the world war, Gleaves and the Ingham leading the Bury west"".

"Looking for a song","That's probably my favorite Sabaton song, but the whole album is pretty good IMO.  The album is called Primo Victoria, I'm pretty sure it's one of the free ones you can download with an amazon prime membership as well."
"Looking for a song","You should absolutely check out more of Sabaton's stuff if you haven't already, they're awesome. Perhaps start with their compilation album [War and Victory: The Best of Sabaton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG-0kiYyBs8&amp;list=PLlHc5zP6BMBjTwvn4bDZ_zQRqPdZ0BClu) and after that check out their album [Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHg5LW3R3Pg)"

I guess it could have been an early draft, but I did not like what I heard in the preview video. Still waiting to get those WAV files they promised for the 5 euro donation, then I'll know for sure.   

Wonder how much money we'd have to pay to just make Simon come back? "
"Pathfinder's Indiegogo has only one week to go, at 22% of their goal :(","Primal Alley seems to be an awesome singer, but to me it's like Dragonforce and Nightwish. When they get a new singer, the bands do take a hit for the first album  

It's VERY hard to find his Pathfinder auditions online, so we have no idea what we are funding"
"Pathfinder's Indiegogo has only one week to go, at 22% of their goal :(","Ha, funny thing is I thought Power Within was a great album, and Dark Passion Play is the only Nightwish album I like. But I get what you mean.  
I've listened to Fifth Element 2.0 a few times now, and I've realized that Primal Alley *can* sound great, but he has a specific range that is very different from Simon's. As long as they write specifically for that range, it might be good. Unfortunately, I think Pathfinder as we knew it is gone either way. "
"Pathfinder's Indiegogo has only one week to go, at 22% of their goal :(","That is what happens when you have a new track called Pathfinder is Striking Back, plus a singer which we have heard very little of besides the fairly poor cover of Fifth Element. Oh, and poor ""marketing""."
"Pathfinder's Indiegogo has only one week to go, at 22% of their goal :(","I don't know why they're even need those music videos. Regular lyric video is enough i think."
"Pathfinder's Indiegogo has only one week to go, at 22% of their goal :(","They could do a better job of selling it, that's for sure.

I'd rather see them do an indiegogo for the next album, and then use the sales from that to make the videos.

Still, no one does symphonic metal like Pathfinder and I'm happy to throw money at them - especially for an exclusive ""The Beginning"" CD. That reward makes it worthwhile whether or not you care about the videos."
"Pathfinder's Indiegogo has only one week to go, at 22% of their goal :(","Do you know where Primal Alley's Fifth Element cover is? I haven't been able to find it!"
"Pathfinder's Indiegogo has only one week to go, at 22% of their goal :(","I helped the fund; I might give more this week. They're one of my fav bands, and BTSBTT is my fav song. I liked Simon Kostro more than Primal Alley, but when you look at the big picture Pathfinder is still amazing. I haven't really analyzed their marketing of the campaign, but I only see anything on Facebook or email subscriptions. They have about 35K likes on FB, so idealistically they should be doing better. I know Protest the Hero achieved their campaign goal for an album, but they have like 350K likes. I personally don't know how they could have advertised better; hopefully they just get more popular with time. I always tell my friends how amazing Pathfinder is, but one person can only do so much."

"The State of the Subreddit","The subreddit has had a bit of a shake up recently, so I thought it would be a good idea to get some discussion going on where we're headed next now that the dust has settled a bit. We had a bit of unofficial discussion regarding this, but not really in a place that was easily visible and open to comments from all of you guys.

First up, [we recently concluded our 2014 year-end awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2v2qlp/ladies_gentlemen_those_who_identify_as_nonbinary/). The voting stage was a bit briefer than usual, but I wanted to get those out there as soon as possible since they were running later than usual, and voting had sufficiently died down to the point that I felt comfortable ending it. There's been a good amount of critiques regarding the results, so when the 2015 awards draw near we'll (mods and users together) re-examine the process and put in any new methods or rules that we think will improve the results. That said, the awards will always ultimately be a popularity contest, and I don't think too many restrictions should be placed on them.

As /u/70000tonsofmetal [brought up](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2v0bm8/great_job_mods_love_the_look_of_this_place/), /u/mushmancat has been doing a good bit of CSS and design work for the subreddit, so thanks to him and continue giving him any feedback you have.

/u/Fazermint [has been continuing our weekly release threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2v3hwl/this_week_in_power_metal_releases_29_215/). My own view is that I'd like to see this become something that's shared between users, particularly so that we might get different perspectives on weekly recommendations, but your input on this would be appreciated, of course.

The sidebar has received a revision as well. We're now making use of [our wiki ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/wiki/index)to host the essential albums, along with our yearly awards. This has tidied up the sidebar quite a bit, as well as provide room for anything else we might want to include there in the future.

Regarding the essential albums, redoing the list has been a much discussed matter. In the next few weeks, I'd like to see that effort be taken up.

I'd also like to see more regular 'official' posts for fostering discussions -- discussions for new and old albums and the like. The first will be an discussion based around [Blind Guardian's recently released Beyond the Red Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPTz7z04_OM) to go up in the next few days. I'd like to see these go beyond 'I liked this album' or 'I liked song ____,' so if you'd like to take part give the album a few listens and form some ideas for discussion points!

Lastly, as you've noticed (or not), we've not done any introductions of new rules and such, nor do we plan to. However, we do have a larger and more active moderating team now, so in case incidences require us to give warnings, we will do so. If people continue being disruptive despite those warnings, they may face temporary bans. But we do think that the community does a great job of watching itself, and such occurrences where even warnings would be required are exceedingly rare. [Just remember to obey the moderator!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0nxsNRT1TU)

Leave thoughts, questions, concerns, suggestions, and excellent power metal below!"
"The State of the Subreddit","In terms of the CSS, I have enjoyed some changes but am bothered by others.  What has been done recently, in terms of making everything smaller, including the background and some spacing between comments, have made the subreddit look very messy and incosistant.  It'd be nice to see this subreddit resized to proper subreddit sized like every other one, including the currently cut-off background.  Other things, such as the sidebar and the upvote/neutral/downvote colors, have been changed in positive ways.

EDIT: In terms of the background, maybe removing it is a valid thing.  Backgrounds are very iffy, especially for forums and such.  Maybe someone who is any decent at design can come up with a theme for the place, specifically in terms of the post layout.  See /r/Overwatch, /r/Smashbros, and /r/CodAW (I'm so sorry) as examples.

EDIT 2: Keep aspects of the theme consistant.  At the moment, the ""distinguished mod post"" colors and sticky colors are different.  I imagine it would be a good idea to keep those colors consistant.  The stickied post color should probably be different than other posts as well, rather than just being a bolded version of the same (or very similar) color.

I would not mind taking part in the weekly release threads.  Are the releases mostly grabbed from Metal Archives?  What other sources might be used?

Redoing the Essential Albums list, as I have already said, is never a bad thing.  Either more people come to an agreement before and the list becomes more ""perfected"", or nothing changes and there was nothing negative about the discussion.

I would definitely be up for album discussions.  I have thought about them in the past, and would definitely be willing to help keep  these on track with the new releases.  I am wondering if there is a way to get 2 stickied posts?  Maybe with modifications or a CSS edit?

In terms of rules, the only thing that I would appreciate is if we officially endorsed (Band - Song Title) as opposed to (Song Title - Band) to keep things organized and to avoid confusion.

I haven't been around too much the past week between work, school, being sick, and very tired, but soon I'll start posting more and start coming up with ideas for the subreddit."
"The State of the Subreddit","Actually, if you could grab me a screenshot that would be helpful. "
"The State of the Subreddit","[Stickied vs. Non-stickied](http://s29.postimg.org/oug0zbvvr/Stickied_vs_Non_stickied.png)

[Stickied vs. Distinguished](http://s14.postimg.org/x1sa34l41/Stickied_vs_Distinguished.png)"
"The State of the Subreddit","Hmmm, I'm glad you mentioned the css. The background image is full sized on my laptop so I didn't know. I'll look into adjusting it tonight. 

I don't see the other stuff you are talking about though. Could you point it out. 

Also, feel free to yell at me about any changes I make. I won't take it personal I was just messing around. As far as I'm concerned the CSS is for all four of us to mess around with. "
"The State of the Subreddit","When you ""distinguish"" your comment as a moderator, it turn yours name above your post to green for the purpose of, ehm, distinguishing it from others.  Usually only used for more ""official"" posts.  I would imagine keeping this color and the color of stickied posts the same would make the most sense.  On top of this, the stickied post color right now is the same color as other posts in the subreddit.  The only difference is the stickied post is bolded.  

Maybe toy around with the colors and see what stickied/distinguished color set works best with the subreddit.  I think green would be fine, but toy around with whatever you like and see what looks good and stands out."
"The State of the Subreddit","One minor problem I see is that in the upper left it looks like it says ""POWERMETALP"""
"The State of the Subreddit","Looks like ""powermetalpo"" to me."

"The State of the Subreddit","The only source I use for the weekly release threads is Metal Archives. "
"The State of the Subreddit","I made a revised banner, made the logo smaller so it fits better, changed Polaris artwork with higher resolution one and made the wolf on Pariah's Child cover a bit smaller as well so he fits nicely.

"The State of the Subreddit","Overall this subreddit has been alright. Usually when a popular band releases something, we'll get a flood of band posts for that band because people remember ""Ah! These guys exist!"", but after a few months, the posts die down"
"The State of the Subreddit","I might sound like a total douche for suggesting this, but how about a wiki page for band writeups? I'm not the only one doing them, and while there are some in the essential albums list, many others are lost as soon as they're off the front page. I know /u/REkTeR did one of Heavenly not so long ago, and someone did Iron Mask recently as well."
"The State of the Subreddit","Not douchey at all, I can make that this afternoon if another mod doesn't get to it first."
"The State of the Subreddit","To give an update: I got the wiki page up with a link in the sidebar and have included a number of articles. I'll get more in there soon. Since some articles might be difficult to track down, if anyone has any to point out, feel free to do so.

I couldn't find the Iron Mask one you brought up."
"The State of the Subreddit","I believe [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2rfx37/a_guideanalysis_of_iron_savior/) might be the one he was talking about."
"The State of the Subreddit","Thanks! Not sure why that didn't turn up in search."
"The State of the Subreddit","Sweet, nice work! Just a heads up, though - the top article under my name says 2014, should be 2015. Just for the next time you're up in there editing stuff."
"The State of the Subreddit","Fixed! I guess an unconscious part of me wanted it to still be 2014, despite Blind Guardian's new album."
"The State of the Subreddit","Lol, I was well into 2013 before I stopped saying 2010"
"The State of the Subreddit","I went all out and made many changes tonight in the stylesheet.  A big one, and maybe controversial, is removing the background image.  I am hoping people prefer it this way, although I did save it and can put it back if people want that.

The reason for removing it is that it was very messy with too much going on, making it distracting and ugly, in my opinion.  Most subreddits don't have a background image, and if they do, it is a lot more simple than that.  I do not think it is necessary, but again, the choice is yours: the community's!

Other little changes here and there; if something bothers you or if something is off in the changes, make sure to say something!"
"The State of the Subreddit","Looks much better without the background.  My only gripe is that I know have an annoying dotted line between the header and comments.   Does anyone else have this showing up?"
"The State of the Subreddit","[deleted]"
"The State of the Subreddit","I'll get rid of that; I was testing it out."
"The State of the Subreddit","I liked the background dragon but I get your point.  
You could lower the image's intensity so it doesn't stand out but is still slightly visible?  

That said. Things look very clean now so it's probably best to not bring back the background image. I'm ok with whatever you guys think is best.  

Another thing I'd like to mention. There's something weird going on with the banner in combination with RES.  
Here's an image of what the ""menu-bar"" looks like here compared to /r/funny (It's cut off on the left side)  
http://i.imgur.com/0LzOtDz.png  
(Also there's a one-pixel wide blue outline on the left and bottom of the powermetal banner)  
  
That is all. Thanks for the hard work. :)
You guys are doing a great job so far."
"The State of the Subreddit","So your header is cut off that much?  I installed RES to see what you were talking about, but mine reaches to the end of the page.  Is it fixed now?  Are you zoomed in your browser at all?

Also, I got rid of the blue border on the left and changed the bottom one to a black one."
"The State of the Subreddit","It's still cut off.  
Here's a screenshot from a different computer and it has the same problem.  
http://i.imgur.com/ux9E2g3.jpg  
It only gets cut off in /r/powermetal .  
Both Google Chrome and Firefox have this problem for me. I'm not zoomed in.  
I don't mind if it stays like this but I thought that if I have this problem, others might have it too and it's only on this subreddit.  
Thanks btw."
"The State of the Subreddit","Oh!  I finally see what you mean now.  I will figure it out.

EDIT: Done."

"The State of the Subreddit","I think the background was slightly too intrusive, but I am still in favor of having something (besides the up/downswords) that makes the page look like /r/powermetal when you're not at the very top."
"The State of the Subreddit","Do you have any ideas for something like that?"
"The State of the Subreddit","Well, someone mentioned the Smash Brothers subreddit at /r/smashbros and I thought that was a good example."
"The State of the Subreddit","I would appreciate any time an album comes out there could be an official self post made for discussion of it.

I'd also agree a re-doing of the essentials list by the community should be done if enough people want it re-visited.

I don't have any major gripes with the way the sub looks (great job /u/mushmancat) except I would say ditch having Joakim as our self-text icon lest we are accused of favouritism :) 

Maybe the background needs an update, depending what people think?"
"The State of the Subreddit","What do we want for a self post icon?"
"The State of the Subreddit","I did like that dragon..."
"The State of the Subreddit","The dragon image that you had before Joakim."

"The State of the Subreddit","When it comes to the essential albums, will we be looking at bands as a whole, going album by album to decide which one is the ""essential one"" or are we going to rely on superfans to step up and give us a rundown on which one(s) are recommended and essential?

Also, I am kicking around a discussion thread idea, but held off this weekend as I felt it would have been lost in the shuffle with what occurred."
"The State of the Subreddit","We can talk about the process when we get to it, but it'll probably be based more around albums than bands (while keeping in mind that there are some bands that definitely need to be on there)."
"The State of the Subreddit","I approve of everything."
"The State of the Subreddit","I think that all the changes so far have been good and I thank all the mods for their work. Regarding the discussion posts, would they be accessible from the wiki page after they have died down? I think that would be a nice resource to have."
"The State of the Subreddit","Great idea - I'll definitely set this up!"
"The State of the Subreddit","I love the CSS work, especially the new font and tidier look to the right-hand bar. It looks much better with the essential albums being a single link too. 

If we redo the essential albums list, I think each person should be able to vote 2 albums: 1 is what they consider the best PM album ever, and the other 1 is what they choose is the best from the old list. That way we don't get too spammed with album suggestions, and the merit of the old list is still honored. Each band can only have 1 album represent them, etc. "

"The State of the Subreddit","Just an idea, since we will never agree on the sidebar albums, maybe have links to the individual lists of flaired members, for instance?"
"The State of the Subreddit","We can probably do something like that."
"The State of the Subreddit","I like what they are doing in /r/Metal with the weekly spotlight albums.  We could do something like that to sort of induct albums onto the essentials list.  

Also the new page looks great!"
"The State of the Subreddit","Now that the essential albums list is moved off the sidebar, we have more room. It'd be great if we could label each album with a few descriptive words / subgenres to help guide newbies."
"The State of the Subreddit","I noticed in the Top section that there are no numbers next to the post score to show the post's rank. "
"The State of the Subreddit","I just messaged the mods about this, after seeing Elan leaked for a second time, but i'd also like to ask the community about this.

How would you feel if we banned posting early/leaked songs? If an artist shares it themselves it would be fine, it would just have to be labeled as WIP or something similar depending on the state of the song, but if it was a leak it would be deleted and the poster given a warning and after repeated offenses (case-by-case basis, if someone constantly post either the same song or other songs that are leaked) they would eventually get temp banned.

It wouldn't be for long, just a few weeks at first and rising if they keep it up."
"The State of the Subreddit","My stance is this: direct links to *any* torrents/torrent sites are not allowed. Links to sites such as youtube/soundcloud are allowed. If content is posted there that an artist or label doesn't want, they have very easy means of taking it down - power that they usually don't have on torrent sites. I don't think it's the place of the mods to forbid links like this: whether or not people want to post and listen to leaks is up to each individual, and I don't think one person's view should determine the actions of another. As I said, if the song owner has an issue with a song being online, they can deal with it at the source."

"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","I have been thinking about the state of /r/PowerMetal at this current time.  I become more annoyed every time I visit this subreddit.  Note:  I have no plans to leave and no big dramatic post that I will regret later because I will come back anyways (ahem, you know who you are!  &lt;3).  However, it would be nice to get this place cleaned up a bit.  Maybe some moderation could start happening as well, as there never has been much of that - trolling and completely non-power metal posts have always slipped by.  There are two main issues at the moment.

&amp;nbsp;

**1) Trolling**  

I am not sure what the rules are against calling out.  Are the rules for all of Reddit or do they depend on the subreddit?  I do not care.  Either way, I am going to do it, because we are a small community with many known members.  Realkman666's trolling has gotten frustrating for a number of people.  This is a message to him and possibly mods.  I do not know why you have started this trolling - if I recall correctly you have been around for awhile and this only is a recent thing.  Is it because the PelleK bashing got on your nerves?  I can understand that to a degree.  But there are better ways to deal with it.  Your comments add nothing and your constant PelleK posts are obviously nothing more than trolls.  There is nothing wrong with posting PelleK but we all know you are feeding this PelleK hate on purpose.  Just look at the titles of your posts.  You know what you're doing.  I was hoping you'd stop, or maybe moderators could take action.

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention - stop downvoting Realkman666 no matter what he posts!  That is immaturity at its finest.  Downvote him if he is being toxic or being a troll, sure.  If he is not, then stop being an idiot.  There is no value in doing that kind of thing.

&amp;nbsp;

**2) PelleK Bashing**

This needs to stop.  There is no need to state how much he sucks every post or at what point you stopped listening to the linked song.  Here are some things I think needed to be pointed out:  firstly, he is a better singer than almost everyone here.  Guaranteed.  He loves power metal and is really putting it out there in his own way.  Honestly, it is pretty cool.  And give it to the guy - he has quite a few good videos.  I personally do not like where he has gone with them for the past while; he used to have a much nicer voice.  But maybe it is simply not for everyone.  Check out his work with Damnation Angels, or his Christmas album if that is your kind of thing (while it is not mine, it is actually really well done).  Secondly, there is a point where it becomes too much and it is almost a form of bullying: simply being mean while offering nothing constructive and offering no intelligent discussion  I am pretty sure he has posted here in the past, though maybe my memory fails me.  If he did, I am sure he would not want to again.  Get over yourselves.  Enough with it; stop being dicks.

&amp;nbsp;

That is about all I wanted to say.  Hopefully people will take this to heart, especially Realkman666.  Too much trolling, silliness and drama.  Let's keep it power metal.  Bring back healthy discussion instead of this toxicity."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","As a lurker can we just stop with this silly business and share some good music thank you"
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","First off, thank you for pointing out the elephant in the room. It's something that I've been wanting to discuss as well, and that's the PelleK bashing.

I get that a majority of this subreddit is not a fan, but to see it posted constantly is not needed. New stuff? Don't see a problem, (promoting new material is a good thing) but to continue shoving it down the subreddit's throat? That gets annoying fast. (I recall saying the same thing a few months back when GloryHammer was getting posted all the time) I prefer some variety with what's posted instead of the same few bands posted all the time.

I would be hesitant to say PelleK should be blacklisted because of this, but it has already been discussed before that the subreddit isn't large enough to warrant such an action (be it PelleK or any other band).

And I will agree on the last point as well;

&gt; Bring back healthy discussion instead of this toxicity."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","I can somewhat agree with this...all the complaining from both sides is accomplishing is a shitty atmosphere."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","&gt; I have no plans to leave, no big dramatic post that I'll regret later because I'll come back anyways

For the record, I did say I was gonna come back at the end of the year to see all the lists and catch up on anything I missed in 2014. No regrets, and I don't see myself sticking around much longer once 2015 begins, especially if this sub remains the way it is.

I wanted to make a post like this earlier, but I didn't know what to say. I completely agree with everything you asserted, though. "
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","It was a friendly attempt to poke fun - do not take it personally.  Many of us are glad you came back, me included."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","Don't worry about that. I saw the heart &lt;3"

"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","As long as we don't have a day dedicated to posting PelleK stuff (I mean we see it so damn much already) I'm fine with people posting him

Probably won't listen to it, but that's my choice

Also it's logical to be annoyed by something you have seen a lot that you aren't a huge fan of, which is where I think the annoyance is coming from. It's also annoying to see people complaining about the guy if you like him, but I'm just saying it is likely that both parties are annoyed."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","I agree. For example, I'm not a huge fan of the Japanese Power Metal signing so I usually just skip it. That being said, the postings of Japanese metal bands is not out of control so I have no problem with it."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","Well, i agree with everything but I'm curious about one thing.

&gt;firstly, he is a better singer than almost everyone here.

What does this have to do with anything? Not trying to raise a discussion, just seems that you're saying that if he sings better than us, he can't be criticized."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","Fair enough, I will elaborate.

Of course he can be criticized; if he is better than us, it does not save him from our opinions.  But the majority of the opinions on him are ""he sucks dick"", ""he's a shitty singer"", ""I stopped at 5 seconds in"", and ""he needs to stop making videos"".  There is nothing constructive about it and the intent is to just be an ass.  If you want to be constructively critical, that is cool.  If you want to be a dick, then stop.  

Also, saying he is a ""bad singer"" shows you are just trying to be an ass.  He's not a bad singer.  There is a difference between him being a bad singer and him being a vocalist you do not like."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","I understand where you are coming from but imo, saying that he is not a bad singer is also incorrect. I actually think that he is a bad singer and a really bad one because he overuses is voice in nearly every song, sometimes sings off key and occasionally uses weird voices that not only ruins the song, it also becomes laughable.

I agree that he has a great voice but that doesn't make him a good or bad singer, there is a lot to singing and it doesn't depend only on the voice."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","The only thing you pointed out there that would be reason to being a bad vocalist was ""sings off key"", and I have never heard him do that.  I think you are grasping at straws there, because if he is great at one thing, it is hitting the notes.  The other two points you made go back to ""being a vocalist you do not like""."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","I like PelleK but if you're gonna literally cover the entire subreddit with him you've got to expect a bit of blowback."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","This was before the subreddit was being filled with him.  And during.  But before, as well."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","I would say that this is a reasonable position."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","All I've gotta say is if you can't handle an artist you dislike existing, please GTFO"
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","Excellent points raised, but entirely pointless unless something tangible is done. In other words, this sub needs a moderator (one who is present on a daily basis).

I haven't been here long enough to have much of an opinion on the matter. The only thing I dislike here is the sidebar elitism. It's hard to tell whether this is a place to discuss opinions on both well-known and obscure power metal bands, or if it's just a place for circlejerk worship of a limited number of bands representing a limited spectrum of power metal, defined by a limited set of quality criteria. But perhaps this is another topic altogether. Just wanted to put it out there."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","I haven't been here long enough to really know as well, but from what I am to understand the ""sidebar elitism"" is mostly a way to introduce those who want to get into PM without posting a ""I'm New, What Do I Listen To?"" thread.

I also see it as albums that those who do frequent PM tend to agree are recommended listening material. I don't agree with all of it, but a majority of it is worthwhile for sure.

But perhaps this is a different topic that can get discussed. I'd be interested to know if it gets a vote of change or stays how it is."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","I don't have a problem with the sidebar itself. As you point out, it avoids the newcomer syndrome. It does need to be maintained, though. There are plenty of bands that deserve a spot. For example, /u/REkTeR just posted a review of Heavenly, which should be on there.

The problem, as I see it, is that you run the risk of getting antagonized for not agreeing with everything that's on the list. If your opinion deviates from the one provided by the list, you're likely to be met with condescension or even insults."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","That is a shame to be basically insulted with a disagreement of the albums there. I mean, what if someone preferred Starfall to Under the Grey Banner? Even with a solid argument, expect some sort of backlash.

And I agree, not seeing it updated is unfortunate, especially with the example you pointed out. It should be something that is taken care of more often than not.

For myself, I've even been tempted to put something up there that we don't have, but it'll get swept away from more links getting posted before long.

"
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","As things stand now, REkTeR's new review will be lost forever in the sea of posts. The same goes for all of my posts. I'd only need to make an index and have that index added to the sidebar, but whether or not my strongly opinionated reviews deserve to be there is yet another topic."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","In reference to the material you have writtten, I think it would be a lot like the guides that are there already. You can agree and disagree however you wish, but it's the perspective of someone who appreciates the band(s) as much as they do."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","Moreover...epic rock radio adds new stuff maybe once in a couple months these days, and the site interface is like 1995 style.

"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","IMHO:

**On the one hand** - UnlostHorizon and mushman tend to think they run the show and everyone just sort of rolls with it despite having a history of trolling/being generally antagonistic. BUT they add some good content so whatever.

**On the other hand** - it's all just light-hearted fun, if you don't like it downsword and move on (or just ignore it). The community is self-policing people only upvote what they want to see more of. We discussed whether this was a good/bad thing when we talked blacklists. "
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","I can't tell what some people expect this sub to be. This is a quite low traffic, low userbase sub, but if anyone thinks one guy trolling is a big time problem, they haven't been around very long.

So there was a day when everyone posted PelleK videos, maybe even a couple days. Did other content stop flowing into the sub? Did NO ONE get a kick out of seeing that stuff everywhere; did it not put a smile on your face? Was like a Christmas blessing of /r/circlejerk with a power metal twist. Were there people who didn't smile and keep scrolling?

Could you elaborate? I don't ever troll knowingly. That whole ""PelleK Tuesday"" was literally my hope to purge the PelleK posts and get people to stop posting his videos ironically. And aside from that, I don't recall having done anything close to ""trolling"". And when am I antagonistic? This is all a huge surprise to me."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","It was more mush = fairly trolly and then both of you kinda antagonistic.

Feel free to disagree if you like, it's just what I've honestly picked up on and it genuinely surprises me that it's surprising to you. 

No grudges though I really like the state of the sub at the moment and I think both you and him have submitted some really quality stuff.  "

I haven't seen any examples of him being a dick, probably because I haven't been looking, but if he is such a problem why not just give him the boot? Although people should probably keep negative opinions to themselves, they should be allowed to say what they like. Half the negative comments I see on here I tend to agree with.

Start with the last (and only) comment below threshold in this post.

If you catch realkman as 1 of the 3-4 replies in a newer post, the trend is him downvoting everyone else to 0; I'm talking rampant, blatant trend. He is an all-around black hole of self-righteous negativity."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","Yeah so what he's obviously being a smart arse because this post was made about him. I would do the exact same thing. It seems like you are the ones who created a troll by not letting someone say what they like. But anyway.
Commence downvoting"
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","It isn't about negative comments - it's about comments which contribute essentially nothing to the discussion other than the growing annoyance of others - aka trolling."

"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","Zing."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","Thing is, he wants this reaction.  Just ignore him, if he's a troll.  Downsword and move on."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","I don't think it's necessary at this point. Once you call someone a troll, there is no interest in communication. "
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","There is clearly interest in communication.  There is little logic to that statement.  Maybe not everyone, but for some people.  UnlostHorizon clearly states that he would like to know whether or not your trolling is going to stop.  I made this post in the first place, including you in it.  It is obvious that I wish to know as well.  

Just because most people would rather downvote every comment of yours does not mean there are no people that would like to see you stop the trolling train and go back to being a decent member."

"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","Let's just say that not worrying or obsessing over what others post would be a good start. "
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","That's not how a subreddit works. Once you start trolling, you start being intrusive. We're both lucky and unlucky to have a mod who is so laid-back in regards to online etiquette, so us, the users of the sub, end up having to call you out whenever you do something stupid or post something asinine.

Posting a different PelleK video every day for shits and giggles and setting out to undermine and mock other users is definitely something we can be ""worried about"". No one cares if I post a PelleK video because I don't do it repeatedly over a small timespan. But you do, and that's why we're ""obsessed"" with your posting habits, if I may indulge you."

"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","Well, I don't think you should be troubled, but continuing to engage me once I've already told you that calling me a troll is not compatible with communication is an odd attitude indeed. "
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","I do not know if you feel the need to defend yourself due to being called out, but go ahead, I do not care.  I just want you to know it would be great if in future you go back to being a decent member, that is all.  The decision is yours to make, I just hope you make the right one."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","Hoping that a stranger agrees to please you and satisfy your desires because you make them know on an Internet forum is an early sign of emotional or mental instability."
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","We are part of the community and what people post affects said community.  We have the right to be concerned.  Why do you think moderation exists in many subreddits?"
"State of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing","To decide what is acceptable or not."

"Ensiferum - One Man Army","I'd say its a step up from Unsung Heroes. "
"Ensiferum - One Man Army","Definitely a step up from Unsung Heroes if comparing this song to the overall quality of that album. 

This song though doesn't hold a candle to Victory Songs (my personal fave). The mix has the guitar melodies so muddy that they might as well just have rhythm and forget writing any lead melodies.

I'll definitely be giving the album a chance. I've in general been very happy with their stuff. "
"Ensiferum - One Man Army","WHAT A DAY. New Jorn Lande song, new Orden Ogan and new Ensiferum"
"Ensiferum - One Man Army","Certainly better than the opening from Unsung Heroes. I don't know what they did with the drums but for me they make the song, which is strange considering I play guitar. The guitar riff(s) are certainly very good, though it would be nice if we could actually hear them at any point after the intro. The solo doesn't stand out much either, the seemingly random harmonics don't really appeal.

Don't know what made them include the choir/shouting in there, perhaps trying to imitate other modern power metal bands, but after listening to this I have very high hopes for the album."

"Avantasia- Black Orchid","It's a little strange how divided people are over the album. It's not really a ""love it or hate it"" thing as much as a ""love it or don't care about it"" one. Personally, I loved every song except for ""Sleepwalking,"" but I know some folks of whom that was the only song they really liked."

"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","**Best Album:** Falconer - Black Moon Rising

**Best Song:** Falconer - Halls and Chambers

*Super hard choice but again the one with the most replays wins.*

**Song With Best Solo:** Unisonic - Your Time Has Come

*Hands down. No question.*

**Best Female-fronted Release:** N/A

**Best Album Cover:** [Unisonic - Light of Dawn](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/Light_of_Dawn.jpg)

*Forget generic power metal cover cliches and the same Felipe Machado Franco-esque artwork, Unisonic went ""FUCK IT LET'S HAVE A FLEET OF STEAMPUNK SPACESHIPS""*

**Singer Of The Year:** Ralf Scheepers of Primal Fear

*Lot of great vocalists showing some amazing work this year but I'm amazed at the consistent quality of Scheepers. Every song he sings still has every last drop of him at his prime and he's like an air-raid siren on every track.*

**Album with Best Lyrics:** Falconer - Black Moon Rising

*Beautiful. Haunting. Paints a hell of a story.*

**Lifetime Achievement Award:** Kai Hansen

And he's 51 YEARS OLD!! Love him.*

**Mightiest Warrior Of 2014:** Fabio Lione

*It's tough being the new guy and I think Angra have found an unexpected perfect-fit with this power metal God. Plus his voice hasn't changed a day. Still remains THE voice of symphonic metal for me.*

*Do I like the fucker? Not always. Is he too opinionated and standoffish? Yes. Does he like stuff that makes the bile rise in my gullet? Yes, sir. Does he contribute consistently informative, discussion-worthy, unique and entertaining content? FUCK YES. This is well-deserved.*"

"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","Hey guys, I've been reading for about a month now, but I just made an account and this is my first post. 

Best Album: Vetelgyus - Galneryus  
I wish I had more time to listen to more albums; I was going to choose Falconer, Twilight Force, or DragonForce, until I heard this masterpiece during New Year's. It's not ""epic"" in the same way as Angel of Salvation, but its best moments just really resonate for reasons I can't explain. The opening synths in ""There's No Escape,"" the defining melody in ""Enemy to Injustice,"" the dynamic splendor of ""The Judgement Day,"" the synergized endings to the previous track and ""Attitude to Life,"" and the beautiful closing ""The Voyage.""  This album has so many defining moments and addictive replay value for me.
 
Best Song: ""The Judgement Day"" - Galneryus 
I had ""Twilight Horizon"" by Twilight Force chosen, but after hearing this album, it was between ""Enemy to Injustice"" and ""The Judgement Day."" While I like that epic melody in the former, ""The Judgement Day"" just has it all: epic intro, epic solo that through me for a surprise in where it went, and amazing finishing synergy by the whole band. It doesn't have the beautiful neoclassical ferocity of ""Angel of Salvation,"" but it's epic in its own way. 

Song With Best Solo: ""Vetelgyus"" - Galneryus 
As an aspiring shredder who's heard just about every type of guitar solo, not much has impressed me this year. Syu in ""Vetelgyus"" though combines guitar soloing with the other instrumentalists perfectly and really hits hard with the synergy. The whole song is an instrumental loaded with solos. I love the guitar vs. keyboards duel starting at 2:56, which gave me a big grin, a feat last achieved by Pathfinder's ""Beyond the Space, Beyond the Time."" At 6:12 there are irish melodies that are enhanced by the other instruments really pushing the guitar soloing. ShadowStrike was a close second. Also, not PM related, but check out Ignazio di Salvo and Per Nilsson (Scar Symmetry) for my favorite lead-guitar material this year. 

Best Unsigned Release: Noble Beast - Noble Beast 
ShadowStrike was the other contender (gorgeous guitar and vocals), but this trumps it with the best guitar riffs of the year. The vocalist is one of the best this year too alongside Twilight Force’s singer. This release is pure power metal with extra ferocity. I wouldn’t have heard Noble Beast without everyone here deifying it, so thanks everyone! 

Best Female-fronted Release: Back from the Edge - MindMaze 
Epica and Divine Ascension had strong releases, and I still plan to listen to Triosphere, but for now I give credit to MindMaze. There's so much melody in the vocals, and it doesn't try to be operatic. It reminds me of Seven Kingdoms like the guitar melodies too. Constant reply value and amazing solo-work too. Plus there's Mike LePond from Symphony X! 

Album With Best Nonguitar Instrumentation: Vetelgyus - Galneryus  
The orchestral sections are blissful, but the keyboards shine through the most. Yuhki is a godly player.  There were other albums with amazing ethnic instrumental flare and exotic timbres like ""Fantasia"" - Estate, but I felt ""Vetelgyus"" was much stronger. 

Best Album Cover: Fantasia - Estate 
Exotic rainbows, mountains, nebulas, and panflutes. That is all.

Album with Best Lyrics: Black Moon Rising - Falconer 
I was not really that cognizant of lyricism quality, especially in PM. I should as I write literature and poetry often. I've always liked Falconer's lyrical quality though as I've heard most of their releases. It paints imagery while sounding genuine and not that cheesy. Epica also had quality lyrics this year (given this style), but Falconer just makes a more genuine connection with me. 

Singer Of The Year: Christian Hedgren (Twilight Force)  This guy's vocals blew my mind; they're simply breathtaking. I can't believe I read some people don't like his vocals. Some parts in ""Twilight Horizon"" are really high and he just keeps going. My new favorite voice up there with my favorites: Tommy Karevik, Roy Khan, Simon Kostro, Russell Allen, Mathias Blad, Matt Smith, Marc Hudson, Rob Tyrant, etc. 

/r/PowerMetal Lifetime Achievement Award To An Individual For Outstanding Contribution To Power Metal: Fabio Lione 
This guy's discography is ridiculous. Rhapsody (of almost every type), Vision Divine, and now Angra. Plus he's contributed to many PM bands like Altair, Ancient Bards, Sebastien, The 4th Dimension, and even a guest in Ayreon. He's even helped out Kamelot for a tour when Roy left.
  
Mightiest Warrior Of 2014: Christian Hedgren (Twilight Force) 
Too epic of a voice. Pure PM. "
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","So these are my pics. I don't really have an opinion on half of the categories, so I'll omit those.

**Best Album**: Sabaton - Heroes. Close call between this and Divine Ascension's Liberator. I've missed most of 2014's releases, mainly because I'm relatively new to the genre and diving into discographies of several bands. But out of the ones I did check out, Sabaton wins out.

**Best Song**: Sabaton - Night Witches. *How* is this not on everybody's top list? Again, close call between this and *Stronger* by Divine Ascension. This song is, in a word, superawesomeholyshitexplosivepowerwinwinwin.

**Best Female-fronted Release**: Divine Ascension - Liberator. Everybody goes for Triosphere, and I'm sure Triosphere will win. I don't mind. I have not listened to Triosphere's release, but I will cause it sounds goddamn good. For me, though, Divine Ascension's *Liberator* blew my mind.

**Upsword Award for Best User**: /u/SinuataBouquet. While the role of posting weekly release threads have shuffled a bit, I'd like to raise my glass to /u/SinuataBouquet for his efforts. Also, where the fuck are you man."
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","Tanks for giving Sabaton some love. Some think that Heroes isn't all that good, but, well, it's hands down their best album IMO. So many awesome tracks."
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","Some of the things I nominated (that haven't been nominated yet from what I see):

**Best Song**: Melodius Deite - Land of Fantasy

9+ min epic full of the most wonderful instrumental parts I've heard in an album, packed with frenetic energy and a chorus that copies Pachelbel's Canon in D note-by-note (which is 100% a good thing).

**Best unsigned release**: Enceladus - Journey to Enlightenment

Apparently Noble Beast will totally dominate this year, which is a shame because Enceladus's debut is damn amazing and it gets hardly any praise. The solos are insane.

**Album with best lyrics**: Derdian - Human Reset. 

It's not exactly lyric poetry, but power metal lyrics tend to be generally crappy. Their song ""These Rails Will Bleed"" completely hit me out of the blue with its theme of suicide (uncanny for power metal) and its powerful message, and it's probably the main reason why I put Derdian here.

**Singer of the Year**: Tony Kakko

I mean come on, the guy sang in 2 albums and his voice has developed nicely (nasal tone and all).

**Mightiest Warrior of 2014**: Chris Bay

For turning Freedom Call from ""eh they suck now"" to ""holy shit they're amazing again!"" with a single album."
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","**Best Album** - Freedom Call - Beyond

This album is stunning.  A few songs that I do not like (even then, they are not that forgettable), but damn, they brought back the magic in a whole new way.  The atmosphere of this album is so intensely and entrancingly fantasy, I just nergasm every time I listen to them.  The melodies, the keyboards, the vocals, the song-writing; it all manages to be so catchy, while being a fairly depthful album for Freedom call.

**Best Song** - Neonfly - Heart of the Sun

I am probably the only one close to thinking this, but something about this song hit me in all the right ways.  I get lost in my fantasy mind when I hear it.  Elvenking’s Witches Gather was a close second.  If the second half was as good as the first, well damn, I don’t know what I’d do…

**Song With Best Solo** - Sabaton - Night Witches

The solo of this song is pretty nice and it keeps the pace and badass feel of the song flowing very well.

**Best Unsigned Release** Noble Beast - Noble Beast

This album was pretty amazing.  The song-writing and technical work is fantastic.  I do not enjoy it nearly as much as some people, and really the only songs that get spins are Nothing to Repent and We Burn, but still - I appreciate it quite a lot.

**Best Female-fronted Release** Epica - The Quantum Enigma

I rarely like female-fronted bands  I usually prefer ladies that sound like men, but damn, there is something about Simone Simons’ voice that just gets me.  I choose this over Triosphere due to the symphonic elements and simply liking more songs, though Triosphere was pretty good as well.

**Album With Best Non-guitar Instrumentation** Twilight Force - Tales of Ancient Prophecies

Mushmancat continues to be incredibly wrong.  This album was fantastic - better than anything Rhapsody of Fire has done (honestly, I do not understand the appeal).  Rhapsody of Fire’s problem is they use the symphonies in a very generic sounding way (besides some exceptions, notable Queen of the Dark Horizon).  Twilight Force brings in the symphony and gives it personality; makes it catchy.  I wish Wintersun released Time II this year, because I am sure it would have won.  Oh well.  Whatever year it is released, it will win.

**Best Album Cover** - Freedom Call - Beyond

Mmf.  Hits me in all the nerdy parts.

**Album with Best Lyrics** Triosphere - Heart of the Matter

I love these kinds of lyrics… not much more to say.

**Singer of the Year** Michael Kiske

 ….he sounds as good as ever.

**/r/PowerMetal Lifetime Achievement Award to an Individual for Outstanding Contribution to Power Metal** - Michael Kiske

I was close to saying Fabio Lione, but honestly, Michael Kiske is just fantastic.  The fact that he is doing what he does at that age astounds me.  I am worried though, because he simply can’t keep up live in 2014 from what I have heard.  2013 and before was fantastic.  Hansi Kursch can take this in 2015.

**Mightiest Warrior of 2014** - Marc Hudson

I envy the shit out of this guy.  So young; so perfect.  Honestly, listen to him live; it is stupid.

**/r/PowerMetal Upsword Award to a User for Contribution to the Subreddit** - That guy who does all them band write-ups… yeah."
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","The more I listen to Neonfly's ""Heart of the Sun"", the more I love it. I'm glad it got a mention, I kinda forgot about it at the time of voting but it's song of the year #3 for me, behing Night Witches and Stronger (Divine Ascension)."
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","Why the hell are people nominating Kiske for lifetime achievement.  The dude stopped making metal for a good 20 years..."
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","Maybe, but his guest appearances and return to power metal in the latest Unisonic album are pretty big."
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","Here's mine (I'll explain anything not covered in my [end of the year review](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2pxvtc/edledhrons_two_thousand_fourteen_in_power_metal/))

Best Album: Falconer - Black Moon Rising

Best Song: Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods

Song With Best Solo: Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods

Since this is the big official thing, I decided to break with my no-BG or Falconer policy, and I'm a BG fanboy so deal with it! 

Best Unsigned Release: Noble Beast - Noble Beast

Noble Beast got some mentions in my thread, but seriously listen to this if you haven't already! It's raw power metal excellence, and the vocalist is fantastic!

Best Female-fronted Release: Triosphere - The Heart of the Matter

Honestly, easily a contender for album of the year female-fronted or not!

Album With Best Nonguitar Instrumentation: Kamijo - Heart

I would go with Epica, but I don't see them as a power metal band. Triosphere came in a close second thanks to their use of the hammond organ, but Kamijo's instrumentation throughout the album is simply at the top tier level of excellence.

Best Album Cover: Falconer - Black Moon Rising

Singer Of The Year: Hansi Kürsch

Again, breaking with the No BG/Falconer thing. Hansi is simply my favorite vocalist. He could sing the phone book and he'd win this award.

Album with Best Lyrics: Falconer - Black Moon Rising

One doesn't listen to power metal to discover a new Shakespeare, but we should celebrate those bands which rise beyond the cheesiest of the cheese. Falconer is one such band, and I enjoyed their lyrics the most this year.

Lifetime Achievement Award: Hansi Kürsch

The mightiest vocalist of all, half of the primary songwriters for Blind Guardian, an influence on many, and participant in many other projects and bands. Hansi has established himself in the top circle of the power metal pantheon.

Mightiest Warrior Of 2014: André Olbrich

The other half of Blind Guardian's songwriting, and while André doesn't get as much attention as the band's frontman, his accomplishments are no less. He's developed a distinct guitar style and has guided Blind Guardian's evolution through the decades while retaining top notch songwriting quality throughout. Twilight of the Gods is an excellent example of this.

Upsword Award for Best User: /u/mistermillennia 

While I haven't commented on many of his posts, I have appreciated reading through many of them, and he maintains a level of quality, effort, and dedication that is simply unmatched on this sub."
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","My picks, if anyone cares.

**Album**- [Noble Beast- S/T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1571Ucf3XA)

Its not really close here.  This album destroys. 

**Song**- [Noble Beast- Nothing to Repent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB6vN3VA_OQ)

see above

**Solo**- Noble Beast- Nothing to Repent

The song is just insanely fucking good. 

**Unsigned Release**- [Disforia- The Age of Ether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRFMOXWUOQ)

Just to diversify a little.  Noble Beast was superior, but this album deserves a nomination. Plus Hansi lent his vocals to the album, which should tell you something.

**Female Fronted Album**- [Triosphere- The Heart of the Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYKX3yxWy1k)

I feel like this band is about to blow up and a lot of that has to do with the presence of Ida Haukland.

**Non-guitar Instrumentation**- [Adamantra- Act II- Silent Narratives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e756WPVJoDQ)

Christian Pulkkinen has earned his spot among the top keyboardists of the genre with this album.  And of that wasn't enough the orchestation, when used, compliments the music perfectly. 

**Album Cover**- [Winter's Edge- The Ferryman's Eyes](http://f1.bcbits.com/img/a3928078660_10.jpg)

Look at that shit! God damn gorgeous

**Singer**- [Michael Kiske](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRDalM6c3hI)

He sounds as good as ever.  

**Lifetime Achievement**- Hansi Kursch

Its a no-brainer. The mastermind behind the definitive power metal band.  Hansen got the award last year, so next in line is withouta doubt Hansi.

**Mightiest Warrior**- Joakim Broden

Sabaton are insanely overrated, but you can't deny that Joakim eats, sleeps, and breathes metal.  His stage presence is just crazy and on top of everything he brought the band back from a split up and has made them arguably more popular than ever.  I may find his music mediocre, but I won't deny that Joakim IS metal. 

**Upsword award**- MisterMillenia.  As said before, his write ups are a highlight of the week around here. The dude did a massive writeup for Panopticon when I posted it, thats just dedication.  


"
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","&gt; He sounds as good as ever. 

For me, Kiske keeps sounding better than he did before. Songwriters are finding out how to use his voice in awesome ways"

"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","Well, here goes nothing. I should mention a lot of my votes were done within the realm of possibility (i.e. choosing a nominee that stands a chance of winning). If you've checked out my posts over the past year, some of these should be no surprise to you. These are who I picked:

* **Best Album:** Triosphere - [*The Heart of the Matter*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0)

Yeah, I know this wasn't my #1 album of the year, but there's no way that Outloud is going to win this, so I decided to give my vote to Triosphere, who released an absolutely incredible album in November. It should be mandatory listening for anyone voting in this poll, at the very least.

* **Best Song:** Kamijo - ""[Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg_DOt-xyig)""

No real surprise here. This song is fantastic, and I know I'm not the only one who hold that opinion.

* **Song With Best Solo:** Jupiter - ""[Last Moment](http://youtu.be/T4t_P6kKXEk?t=3m25s)""

Again, not a huge surprise if you've followed my posts or if you've heard this solo. I promise there'll be no more JPM here!

* **Best Unsigned Release:** Ninth Circle - [*Legions of the Brave*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzlYdS7hZ_0)

This is probably my only ""wasted"" nomination, since it's a given that you guys are going to vote for Noble Beast's debut album (which is incredibly overrated), but I thought this album at least deserved a mention somewhere in this voting.

* **Best Female-fronted Release:** Triosphere - [*The Heart of the Matter*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0)

If this surprised you, you may need glasses.

* **Album With Best Nonguitar Instrumentation:** Kamijo - [*Heart*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVYZe9NVq2g)

I lied about the JPM thing, btw. It was between this and Epica, frankly, and I decided to give the vote to Kamijo, since Epica's main drawing power on their new album, IMO, was the heavier sound derived from the guitars, not the orchestral passages.

* **Best Album Cover:** Estate - [*Fantasia*](http://mightymusic.dk/wp-content/uploads/Cover-RGB.jpg)

I'm gonna be pissed if Sabaton wins this or something. Just look at that cover.

* **Album with Best Lyrics:** Triosphere - [*The Heart of the Matter*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0)

I'm gonna be pissed if Sabaton wins this or something.

* **Singer Of The Year:** [Marc Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQPWAJWAYNQ)

I'm gonna be pissed if Joakim Broden wins this or something. Marc did a stellar job on the new DF album, and his live performances are almost impeccable. He's slotted himself almost seamlessly into the band and that deserves praise.

* **/r/PowerMetal Lifetime Achievement Award To An Individual For Outstanding Contribution To Power Metal:** [Michael Kiske](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92_XyoAGprc)

Relevant link. Those lyrics are all I need to say.

* **Mightiest Warrior Of 2014:** [Marc Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvquZi1Cipw)

This dude genuinely seems to love what he's doing, he's great at what he does, and I'd be pretty content with having him represent power metal at some barbaric metal conference. Either him or Fabio Lione, but since Fabio didn't release anything substantial in 2014, my vote goes to Marc.

* **/r/PowerMetal Upsword Award To A User For Contribution To The Subreddit:** /u/MisterMillennia

This fucker has been doing complete writeups on all the previews in the weekly releases thread for about 2/3 of the year. They're massively long, and they're a breath of fresh air from the usual comments that single out just one album and make a joke/comment about it. I think his efforts should be recognized, and his love for power metal (which has blossomed tenfold this year) should be acknowledged. He's always been open to new music, new vocal styles, new bands, and he's done nothing but be as kind and as insightful as he can be on all of his posts, and that's the kind of guy I want to see get rewarded with this award."

"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","Jeez. It was a joke. The massive steel balls hit my chin repeatedly as well. That's why I liked it so much. "

"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","I knew my hastily cobbled-together hatchet job would reveal flaws somewhere."
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","Ok, here it goes

* **Album** - [Crimson Shadows - Kings Among Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrULHAdyqBg)

I know, It's not 100% clean power metal band, but those drums, those guitars, those solos are just insane! But i have to mention that if i could choose more albums it'll be Dragonforce and Hammerfall

* **Song** - Crimson Shadows - Freedom and Salvation (can't find album version on YT so no link here, but listen to it on Spotify)

Oh moomy, this song is so great. It's... It's... IT'S MAGNIFICENT! (I love this word)

* **Solo** - [Dragonforce - Extraction Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdd4eU4YHVE)

Sure, it's Dragonforce! It's always Herman Li.

* **Unsigned Release** - [Kolony - Sledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fywLXF2yJmI)

I don't know what to say really. Just listen.

* **Female Fronted Album** - [Triosphere - The Heart of the Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqFtlAnhzu8)

I'm not a big fan of female fronted power metal bands (Actually the only female fronted bands i like are Battle Beast, Forgotten Tales and Claymorean) but after i first heard her voice, i wasn't sure if its female or male fronted band. And it's absolutely epic.

* **Non-guitar Instrumentation** [Exlibris - Aftereal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd30lArQdaQ)

I love keys on this album but the violin solo on ""The Day of Burning"" by Zbigniew Wodecki... Unreal!

* **Album Cover** [Neonfly - Strangers in Paradise](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H6NElpJlCsA/VDL5AcJetcI/AAAAAAAACBE/mqvKANz3o5M/s1600/Neonfly_artwork.jpg)

* **Album with Best Lyrics** [Noble Beast - Noble Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPn2e5zG1Lk)

&gt;It's a time of hate and fear
&gt;
&gt;Full of misery and pain
&gt;
&gt;But I look into your eyes my friend
&gt;
&gt;And I know it's not in vain
&gt;
&gt;For amidst insanity
&gt;
&gt;We must cling to our humanity
&gt;
&gt;For all of our brothers
&gt;
&gt;And all of the others
&gt;
&gt;We will never falter
&gt;
&gt;With righteous flame we burn


* **Singer of the Year** - [Marc Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQPWAJWAYNQ)

Even though i think he's the best this year, i still can't decide if he's better than ZP Theart


* **Lifetime Achievement Award To blablabla...*** [Fabio Lione for doing amazing shit with Angra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1bO3jV74IY)


* **Mightiest Warrior** - [Fabio Lione](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1bO3jV74IY)

He can literally sing everything, everywhere and i love when he sings live. Just freaking awesome dude!

* **Upsword Award To A User For blabla...** - [kecos](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2rfx37/a_guideanalysis_of_iron_savior/)

I'm not here long enough to really say who's the best user and who's posting the best things here, but I can say that i love kecos for doing ""A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior"" lately. Thanks dude. "
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","**Best Album:** Primal Fear - Delivering the Black

I go with what has been an album I kept going back to over and over again throughout the year. Honorable mention to Falconer's Black Moon Rising and Freedom Call's Beyond

**Best Song:** Hammerfall - Hector's Hymn

This song brought me back to Hammerfall after their last album.

**Song With Best Solo:** N/A

**Best Unsigned Release:** Noble Beast - Noble Beast

Nothing really blew me away for this category, even Noble Beast. Although they were the most memorable of the bunch I did hear.

**Best Femail-Fronted Release:** Mindmaze - Back From the Edge

I picked this solely because I got into this band and wanted more. I got that with the new album and was once again blown away by this band.

**Album With Best Nonguitar Instrumentation:** Epica - The Quantum Enigma

Hard to not nominate this album, especially with it being one of their best.

**Best Album Cover:** Timo Tolkki's Avalon - Angels of the Apocalypse

**Album With Best Lyrics:** Heroes - Sabaton

No this is not a troll pick but my actual pick. There are few bands where I care of the lyrical content, bt Sabaton I want to know what they're singing about.

**Singer of the Year:** Joakim Broden

Honorable mention to Michael Kiske and Stu Block. Joakim doesn;t have an off day no matter what he performs on, where it is, you name it.

(I also went with singers that released full-length material in the year, thus why Hansi is not mentioned)

**Lifetime Achievement Award:** Kai Hansen

Seriously, he's done everything. Although he didn't have the strongest Gamma Ray release (hard to recreate Powerplant) he's done everything possible in Power Metal. He even rocks it with Kiske in Unisonic, so I can't complain.

**Mightiest Warrior of 2014:** Ritchie Faulkner

This guy steps into Judas Priest, with all eyes on him and he doesn't disappoint. In fact, his guitar play seems to light a fire under the entire band and they release their best album since Painkiller. Good on him for not crumbling under the pressure.

**Upsword Award:** N/A

I don't feel I can properly nominate for this category."
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","&gt; Primal Fear - Delivering the Black

I just started to listen to this album, and it's indeed quite awesome. "
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","Kai won the award last year, for the very reasons that you stated.  He has done it all. "
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","My apologies. I was unaware of this seeing how this is my first year voting on the awards."
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","No need to apologize. You were indeed correct in saying Kai deserves the award. "
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","I liked Nostradamus a hell of a lot and Angel of Retribution is fantastic."
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","I liked Nostradamus as well, but it tends to get a bad reputation from most. Angel of Retribution was a good album, but I feel it's forgettable after the first 3-4 tracks."
"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","**Best Album:** [Galneryus – Vetelgyus]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv05oHDjus4)

This was a tough decision as there wasn’t a huge, standout album for me but Falconer – Black Moon Rising and Galneryus – Vetelgyus are the two albums I’ve been listening to all year so it’s only fair I vote for one of them. I adore Mathias Blad’s singing and Black Moon Rising is such a fucking good song but I found Vetelgyus more consistently enjoyable.

**Best Song:** [Falconer - Black Moon Rising]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv05oHDjus4)

Choosing the best song was even harder than choosing the best album. I figure that Black Moon Rising is probably the new release I have listened to the most this year, and being the fantastic song that it is, deserved this prize more than any other.


**Song With Best Solo:** N/A



**Best Unsigned Release:** [Disforia – Age of Ether]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NCwW_lblwI)

Apparently Noble Beasts album is very good. I haven’t actually listened to more than two of the songs though so my vote goes to Disforia for their album Age of the Ether. Every track on this album is fantastic and very atmospheric. It tells an awesome story, has fantastic keyboards and Hansi Kursch being a guest vocalist on one song really helps it stand out.  Runner up was Elderoth - Mystic


**Best Female-fronted Release:** [Ancient Bards - A New Dawn Ending]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHsZmsIOYXc)

This was a pretty easy one for me, although there have been some amazing female fronted releases this year (Triosphere, Mind Maze &amp; A Sound of Thunder to name a few) this album tops them all and the symphonic metal elements really sold this album to me more than the others and made it one of my favourites of 2014.

**Album With Best Non-guitar Instrumentation:** [Galneryus – Vetelgyus]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KN3ju3xPmo)

My two favourite non guitar instruments in anything ever are the violin and the keyboard. Unfortunately I haven’t paid a huge amount of attention to exactly how good every bands instruments were but I really like Galneryus’ Vetelgyus and it has some damn good keyboard in it so it gets my vote.

**Best Album Cover:** [Falconer – Black Moon Rising]( http://planetmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Falconer-Black-Moon-Rising-album-cover.jpg)

I wasn’t paying much attention to album art either but this one is pretty cool. Runner up goes to [Sonata Arctica – Pariah’s Child]( http://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Sonata-Arctica-Pariahs-Child.jpg) because it was so damn satisfying and reassuring to see a wolf back on the cover of a Sonata Arctica album and [Melodius Deite - Voyage Through the World of Fantasy]( http://www.inazumaprod.com/userdata/gfx/36cf54bbe8ef8adcc1f128f365a77845.jpg) because it makes me so gosh darn happy to look at it.

**Singer Of The Year:** Hansi Kursh

He may only have released a single this year but I can’t help giving him my vote for best vocals (and will continue to every year till he wins it). Runner up goes to Sara Squadrani of Ancient Bards.


**Album with Best Lyrics:** N/A


**Lifetime Achievement Award:** [Fabio Lione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Lione)

Although his release this year with Angra wasn’t stellar Fabio has been a huge figure in the power metal scene. His involvement in so many successful ventures in power metal scene have made him an inspiration. He also has some fantastic hair.


**Mightiest Warrior Of 2014:** N/A


**Upsword Award for Best User:** /u/MisterMillennia

I considered /u/SinuataBouquet &amp; /u/unlosthorizon &amp; /u/mushmancat for the weekly releases threads but considering how often the job has switched hands I think it’s unfair to give it to only one of them (also /u/unlosthorizon got it last year so we can hardly give it to him twice). MisterMillenia has been extremely consistent, interesting and informative in his weekly analysis posts and deserves this award more than anyone else. We better be getting him a cool flair or something."

"Nominations for the /r/PowerMetal Awards 2014 are now OPEN!","* **Best Album** - [Noble Beast - Noble Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPRDE17-xIQ) - I can only hope for this album to get some recognition and somehow become a benchmark of what power metal will be in the future but i know that it won't. This album, was a sigh of relief in a sea of power metal shit, riffs for days, solos for days, amazing baritone vocals (thank god), and to my very welcome surprise, no pussy ass ballad crap, the album flows perfectly and so does my head-banging. I won't say it's perfect, but it's by far the best power metal album this year.

* **Best Song** - [Dark Forest - Secret Commonwealth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAfcLfIydck) - I am positive this will never win but, my god, this song is amazing! and for the least power metal reasons, don't get me wrong, it's power metal for sure, the melodies are amazing and the songs consistently delivers guitar work, drumming and a variety of melodies that completes the song into an extremely enjoyable tune, there is always something going on and, most importantly, in a genre filled with bands, albums and songs that always want to do more instrumentation and be louder and be ""bigger"", this a shining example where less is more. Kudos to Dark Forest for creating an amazing album this year.

* **Song With Best Solo** - [Jupiter - Last Moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4t_P6kKXEk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m35s) - I may be an asshole when it comes to JPM but i like to think that I am a fair asshole and I like to give credit where credit is due, JPM is not devoid of talent by any means, they just make very questionable musical choices and end up with a myriad of bad songs with the occasional shining moments. This is one of them... A sucky sucky song with an awesome solo. It's just that, it sucks for a whole 3 minutes but then the there's a good buildup to the solo and then BAM! kick-ass solo!... and then is sucks again for the rest of the song. Think of it as a really boring roller coaster, but then it starts to go faster and BOOM it starts to go up and down and sideways at 200 km/h, does 3 barrel rolls, 2 front flips and 1 and half front flip and then it comes to an halt... and you die. That's this song.

* **Best Unsigned Release** - [Noble Beast - Noble Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPRDE17-xIQ) - It just is. 

* **Best Female-fronted release** - [Ancient Bards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIWmCPeVZSM) - It's a good album, very dramatic sometimes, she sings amazingly in my opinion.

* **Album With Best Nonguitar Instrumentation** - [Adamantra - Act II - Silent Narratives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e756WPVJoDQ) - I'm with /u/mushmancat on this one, really sweet keyboarding going on here, the album is nothing spectacular.

* **Best Album Cover** - [Alestorm - Sunset on the Golden Age](https://burningfist.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/alestorm-sunset-on-the-golden-age.jpg) - Fun album by a fun band, i think the album cover is really cool.

* **Album With Best Lyrics** - [Sabaton - Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYWdgBtSM8s) - Cause /u/UnlostHorizon.

* **Singer Of The Year** - [Kiske](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92_XyoAGprc) - You all have heard the man, needs no explanation.

* **/r/PowerMetal Lifetime Achievement Award To An Individual For Outstanding Contribution To Power Metal** - [Fabio Lione](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVs9vUej_L4) - The fucker is everywhere and does a ton for power metal and he is always consistent. He is almost always a plus in all bands he sings.

* **Mightiest Warrior Of 2014** - [Broden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgSehsHOUdo) - Awesome stage presence, seeing this guy live is just fucking amazing. Sabaton is beyond overrated and have an impressive repertoire of fodder songs but, this guy does his best to make them shine and seems to always pull off an impressive performance.

* **/r/PowerMetal Upsword Award To A User For Contribution To The Subreddit** - /u/Fazermint - I have a ton of respect for /u/MisterMillennia but, in my opinion, he just straight up likes 95% of all releases and i end up only liking 5% of all releases, [so reading his reviews for me is kinda pointless](http://i.imgur.com/1l5cpe5.gif). /u/Fazermint are a lot of fun to read and i hope he continues, even if it's moving at a snail's pace."

This whole album is incredibly inspiring and uplifting with its messages, one of my favorite DF albums of all time. "
"Dragonforce - Tomorrow's Kings","Ahh, I thought the intro was charming, and a perfect contrast to the intense power metal that is about to come."

**SinuataBouquet's Recommendation of the Week**

Lots of variation this week, had a blast listening through the promo tracks! Power with progressive and speed metal influences, and also some melodeath. Many different vocal styles as well.

Tom Englund from Evergrey appears on the track Closer on Exlibris new release. No surprise in a way, this guy is everywhere.

I think **Reason Behind** stood out this week. It's fast, melodic and sweet. They released an EP back in 2012, but The Alpha Memory is their first full-length album.

---

**Highlight of the Week**

All-female japanese power metal band Cyntia are active on the japanese power metal scene. They've been releasing an album a year, and successfully released their third full-length album in february this year. The promo track ([閃光ストリングス](http://youtu.be/ghauU_VBtDg)) was pretty power, but some of the stuff they released later during the year has been much more poppy. Their latest tune is called _Kiss Kiss Kiss_ and sounds more like an anime opening than a metal song. Not sure what direction they will head in the future, but it seems as if they will release an album fairly soon, so we'll just have to wait a couple of months!

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/1 - 12/7)","Aight, let's do this.

**Exlibris**: This is all right. Pretty decent instrumental parts, and a pretty sweet *violin*(!) segment by some dude called Wodecki. The vocalist is pretty good, too. I can't get myself to care about this particular song, though, but that's just me.  
**Reasons Behind**: This could have been a decent song, if the voice didn't want me to stick forks in my ears. I'm exaggerating a little, but only a little. Musical part is all right, nothing spectacular and not melodic enough to be called melodic (imo). Drums are probably the best part. Maybe I'm extra picky today, but there's a difference between singing and *whining*.  
**Alltheniko**: I like speed metal, and these guys have got an all right, generic speed metal sound going. The solo is pretty cool and all. My only complaint is that this song would have been better as an instrumental only song, because holy shit shut the fuck up, dude. I'm so picky I'm about to burst, but really, the guy sounds like my grandma using a really, really poor quality mic.  
**Kouzin Bedlam**: At least I like the voice in this one. Great progressive vibe, and while the guitars and drums have good execution, they mostly stay in the background. When the solo segment comes though, it's their time to shine. It's a really damn good solo segment, too. The vocals are good, catchy and uplifting.  
**Messiah's Kiss**: This is power metal mixed with old-school hard-rock style singing. A little generic, perhaps, for the power metal crowd, but chances are you'll get a kick out of this if you like AC/DC and stuff.  
**Renegade**: This stuff's pretty cool. I can't really find that much to say about it, except that I don't hate it. And that says *alot*.  
**Space Vacation**: Awdamn, there's only a 30 second teaser for this. It sounds really promising, it would probably be my favorite of this week. But I can't really know for sure.  
**Wretch**: A track-by-track preview. From what I hear, the vocalist is average but the instrumental part more than makes up for it. Doesn't sound like something I'd personally get into, but it's definitely worth a checking out if you're not as picky as me :P  
**Blodwen**: In the beginning of the track, it sounds like they're trying to emulate Nightwish in the Tarja era. Then the verse begins and  I think the appropriate thing to do is cringe a little and close the video. I sat through it for your sake, to warn you of the imminent bleeding ears you'll get from this.  
**Stilverlight**: A pretty folky guitar riff in this one. Can't get myself to care about the rest of the song. The best parts are definitely then they pull out that guitar and get some riffs going. There's some keyboard here and there, too. Hey, another song better off as instrumental-only. It's just raining boring/bad vocals this week, huh?  
**Kolony**: Wowow. The intro segment is deliciously melodic, powerful and intense. The vocal style somehow gives me a viking metal vibe, is that just me? A pretty catchy and awe-inspiring song, I'm curious about the rest of their work.

Aight. Kinda mediocre week. My recommendations for this week would be Kouzin Bedlam, and the Kolony release from a couple of weeks back sounds very intereseting."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/1 - 12/7)","Of interest, this Exlibris song just appeared on my youtube subscriptions, and i think it's a lot better than the preview song shared here (like a loooooooot better):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAKQWeQ6NSM"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/1 - 12/7)","I know in an earlier comment you said you don't like harsh vocals and prefer uplifting and happier melodies like those of RoF, but how do you feel about songs where the two are mixed? Here are some Rhapsody of Fire songs where they do just that:

[Reign of Terror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aItNg5SDX9Q)  
[Aeons of Raging Darkness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta_KhUa3O7Q)  
[Tornado](https://soundcloud.com/nuclearblastrecords/rhapsody-of-fire-tornado) (Soundcloud link)"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/1 - 12/7)","I'm actually pretty fond of the song Reign of Terror. I'm generally open for songs mixing clean and unclean vocals, but for me to take a liking to them, the unclean vocals have to make sense with the rest of the song, rather than being put there for the sake of having unclean vocals (which seems like kind of a trend). Know what I mean? Checked out Aeons of Raging Darkness and Tornado, and they're both decent. As long as the clean-to-unclean ratio is large enough, and it fits with the song, I don't mind. I just can't get into subgenres where the unclean vocals are the main thing. So that's why I always skip anything related to death / black metal.

I remember saying Sabaton was the closest I'd get to unclean vocals, even though the guy just sings in a lower register and rarely actually growls. But now that I think about it, I actually used to listen to Bullet for my Valentine, which also mixes clean and unclean vocals. The most screamy song of theirs that I like would be [Ashes of the Innocent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urS5DDNE9Jw). It's the chorus and guitar solo that I like, but they're great enough that I don't really mind the screamed verses.  "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/1 - 12/7)","Also noting after I listened to it again that that specific Kolony song is about a guy's father dying (and the theme of what sort of legacy each person leaves behind), and the lyrics are pretty damn good. (Actually giving me the feels) Now I like it even more."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/1 - 12/7)","That's cool, not a very common lyrical theme. Reminds me of [Amorphis - Silent Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb2gjwq1WXg), which is about the opposite - a father outliving his son. I've neither lost a father nor a son, but still gives me the feels. "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/1 - 12/7)","Dear god that Blodwen song is painful.  "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/1 - 12/7)","I warned you :P"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/1 - 12/7)","This week on /r/powermetal: shred violin, epilepsy, God Dethroned, sick babies, b-side Steel Panther puns, expat Samael, frozen flash audio, exclusive twin guitars with distortion and Thor's former sick Jackson Kelly.   "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/1 - 12/7)","Hey guys, I totally forgot what time of week it was, and almost missed this completely! Wouldn't have been a smart thing, seeing as how I will be on holidays for the next three weeks and won't be able to do my opinions for those ones (I'll just post an opinions megathread when I get back or something).

In other news, a word of warning for all you headphone users out there - wearing tightly/snuggly fitting headphones too long can lead to you starting to go bald in the areas where the headphones come in contact with your head. Why do I know this? ... No Reason... This will also be me making up an excuse about why things sound different this week - I'll be listening through my laptop speakers (which are bass boosted) instead of my headphones to try and preserve the hair that I still have lef-UM SHIT I MEAN NEVERMIND.

My opinions (based upon previews only):

- **Exlibris:** Holy *fuck* that violin. I need a minute. Seriously, Strings - best instruments. The vocals are decent, they fit the song perfectly, and the instrumentation is pretty great (ignoring the solo for now), they had a great riff, and they had an almost Folk Metal level of dancey drive to the tune. That Violin solo was the highlight of this song though; that was such a unique and interesting thing, I've never heard a band actually do the Metal Distortion to their non-guitar instruments. No matter what song that had been put with, overall I would of probably liked it.

- **Reasons Behind:** I have too agree with /u/fazermint on this one - the instrumentation is freaking sweet, but those vocals kill it. Normally I really like female vocalists because they diffuse the harshness of the music really well, but this... She just sounds *awful*; too light and Operatic, and completely at odds with the instruments.

- **Alltheniko:** I really like this one - they have a very GarageBand style to their music; the vocals don't have high production value, but still carry well, the instrumentation has the same rough style to the production value, and helps make everything feel like it belongs together. Overall, I like this song quite a bit (this might just be my laptop speakers hiding the problems though).

- **Kouzin Bedlam:** I really like the instrumentation for this one; the keyboard helps to diffuse the heaviness of the drums and guitar, and leaves us with a brilliant amount of heaviness and drive. The guitars themselves are glorious, and the drums set a great beat. The vocals are pretty good, not too harsh, not too soft, just right. Overall, this was a pretty great song.

- **Messiah's Kiss:** I don't think there is anything I can really say about this that /u/Fazermint hasn't already covered. Hell, he even used the same band I was going to use. The instrumentation is a great mix of Pub Rock and Metal, and the vocals are very punchy and fun. Overall, a bloody great song.

- **Mors Principum Est:** So, I'm 50/50 on this song. The instrumentation is bloody sick outside of the sung sections, and has a brilliantly fast and heavy level. During the singing sections a lot of the awesomeness is bled out of the song, which is disappointing, but they are still reasonably good. The vocals are... ok...? They probably sound better through headphones, but they sound like they are a little at odds with the heaviness and roughness of the instrumentation. As time went on, I warmed up to the mix of the two, but it was a little jarring to begin with. Overall, pretty decent if you can ignore the small problems I have with it.

- **Space Vacation:** Sweet instrumentation, weak vocals. Oh wait, this was 29 seconds long, so this opinion is already going to take longer to read than it will to listen to the preview. At least the JPower bands give us 1'30"" to listen to.

- **Wretch:** God damn there's something for bloody *everyone* in this album it seems. The first preview was very driven, and had a great dancey vibe to it. The second was pretty damn sweet, the third had a brilliant focus on the bass, and bogan Pub Rock backing singers. The fourth rounded everything out well with a slower song. Overall, while I would have preferred them giving everything to us, I am happy with what I heard.

And the stuff I missed last week:

- **Blodwen:** ... Wow... No way to save this song. The instrumentation was very textbook, but could have been decent. But those vocals were just rubbish. They sounded like a female Kamijo trying to sing Operatic English, and it just *doesn't work*. A little higher baseline on her voice and things might have worked out, because at sections where she sings higher, she breaks out of the whole ""shitty singer"" and has some decent vocals in there. Seriously, that section at around 3'20"" where she sings softly and highly was positively acceptable, and what does she do? Go back to the rubbish style. Overall, not really worth the listen.

- **Stilverlight:** Got to agree with /u/Fazermint again; the instrumentation are fucking great, but the vocals and lyrics are rubbish. Would have sounded less awkward in their native language, and considering how good the harsher parts of the vocals sound, would have turned this from shit to gold. Those instrumental sections are fucking glorious though, which is unfortunate.

- **Kolony:** *Fuck*. *Yes*. This was fucking glorious. The instrumentation was a perfect mix of heavy and fast, and the vocals were harsh and were very Punk Rock in style, adding a really nice undertone to the song. This was fucking great, I am enjoying this so hard.

As for /u/SinuataBouquet's highlight:

- **Cyntia -  閃光ストリングス:** God damn I love that instrumentation... And those Vocals... Well fuck me everything is good with this one. The instruments are very fast and light, and mix perfectly with the vocals. The Vocals are great, and the song is sung at the right pitch to mesh well with the instrumentation, which is actually not that common for JPower bands, surprisingly. I would have liked the Highlight to be of the whole song, but Japanese bands and their minute thirty bullshit I guess. Oh well, for what we got, it sounds freaking sweet. Thanks for this /u/SinuataBouquet!

Well, that's that I guess. I'll see if I can squeeze in the time to do next weeks opinion, but if I don't I'll see you all around Christmas! Have a good one!

Edit: Oh Right the Highlight..."

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/1 - 12/7)","OP: If you liked *Limit Break* from this year, you're gonna absolutely love *Dazed and Delight* from Aldious from this year. The first single from it, ""[Dominator](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x16h0h9_aldious-dominator_music)"", is one of my favorite songs from this year, and as a whole the album is a lot more consistent than Cyntia was.

[How I feel having to save the day.](http://i.imgur.com/Qr84XcX.gif)"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/29 - 1/04)","All the spectators lose their shit, its great. It's a shame that nothing like that can ever happen in wwe"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/29 - 1/04)","Well, looks like I have an exam to to on the 7th of January, so next weeks previews thread and my own Best Previews of 2014 will have to wait until after that.

Thanks for filling in /u/UnlostHorizon, I had almost given up hope that there would be Power Metal to listen to this week.

My Opinion (based upon previews only):

- It's my opinion that you should all go listen to **Immortal Guardian**s EP again. That thing was fucking great.

What I missed last week:

- **Age of Artemis:** The foundations of this song reminds me of those good late 90s Rock tunes - it's not too extreme, it's not too fast, and it's not memorable, but it definitely helps the additions sound better, and makes it great. The light ~~trash~~ thrash inserted into the base tune helps to break things up, and the vocals take a huge focus, and they are pretty decent. Overall, it's probably not all that memorable, but it is still a good song.

- **Eternal Dream:** I really like the drive and instrumentation of the song, and I somewhat like the Operatic nature of the vocals. For once, I feel like the high pitch of the vocals *work* with the instruments (probably due to the keyboard adding additional buffer room for the vocalist to sing that high), and the operatic singing matches the speed and drive of the instrumentation, allowing them to both benefit from one another. Initially, I was going to say that I dislike it, but as time has gone on, I have come to actually like what I hear. There you have it guys, I may have come to like Operatic vocals!

- **CETI:** I don't really know what to say about this song - I like it, but nothing really stands out as a reason why. It's just a solid Heavy Metal song, with nothing really glaringly wrong with it, but also nothing specifically outstandingly right with it.

- **Sonic Pulse:** I don't really like this one all that much unfortunately - it's too much Punk, not enough Metal for me to overly enjoy, The instrumentation feels inconsistent and disjointed during the sections where there are no singing (it gets better later on, but still has remnants of the aimlessness), and the vocals don't really add anything of note to the whole performance. Overall, I don't really like it all that much.

- **Sethirus:** Don't like this one either. It's a lighter Thrash Metal song, but it is still definitely Thrash Metal. The guitar solo is great, but other than that, I don't really see any reason why I would enjoy what this song has going on. Overall, not my shit, but maybe someone else will like it.

/u/~~Sinuata~~Horizons Recommendation:

- **Lost Horizon:** Ah, good place to leave Power Metal for the year /u/UnlostHorizon! I would have been very disappointed if the last song of the year had been something Thrashy and altogether not that enjoyable. Luckily your fans made a dedication band to you, and they play great Power.

Huge Thanks to /u/sinuatabouquet, /u/mushmancat and /u/UnlostHorizon for taking time out of their schedules, every single week, to compile these lists and find links to the music for us all to listen to, and a massive thanks to you guys for putting up with my bullshit for the 9 or so months I have been forcing my opinions on you, you guys are great, and I hope to join you all in rocking out to Power Metal next year and into the future as well! I'll see you guys next year!"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/29 - 1/04)","Age of Artemis preview is a cover from Helloween (Time of the Oath (1996)), hence the 90's feel."

No wonder I like it.

Thanks for informing me mate, I'm honestly surprised I am that close on the when..."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/29 - 1/04)","And 2014 power metal is done for me. "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/29 - 1/04)","Out of all the previews Dionis totally kills the competition, those russians sure know how to make awesome music."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/29 - 1/04)","Man, I'm really itching for bands like Sonic Pulse and Sethirus that have really good singers. Like, they don't quite sound like people singing, they're just sorta shouting. I really dig the instrumentation, but come on, we gotta get some sweet vocals in here. Thrash instrumentation is fine enough but I just can't get over the vocal style"

"Axxis - Bloodangel","Axxis is so good."
"My favorite albums of 2014","These aren't in any order, but I do have one disc of the year.

[Edguy - Space Police](http://youtu.be/NXByLCwYKW8?list=PLNcioWfkdxJiB0x454m26BcC8-LzGhrxm)

I really haven't liked pretty much anything they've done since Rocket Ride. I felt they went really off the rails on a hair metal train going straight to shittown. There was absolutely nothing memorable about them. I didn't have high hopes for this album, but to my surprise I just kept hitting the repeat button. It still doesn't hold a candle to their older work, but it's nice to know that Edguy does know how to right good melodic metal given the right circumstances.

[Equilibrium - Erdentempel](http://youtu.be/vPNOIK_kBx4?list=PLEFNRJ3-oh8c9OFMnSPwOCOLoDxPAYgDp)

These guys are the current kings of viking metal. Their last album was fucking brilliant and somehow they achieved brilliance again with their latest outing. The rhythm section is top notch, the orchestrations soar, and the vocalist doesn't just warble incoherently over a background noise. Most of the time in black/death metal the vocalist just adds to the noise. This guy follows a rhythm and follows the music and let's it become important.

[Threshold - For The Journey](http://youtu.be/ToYSRker8UM)

They seem to have settled into a comfortable pace. They haven't really changed their sound since Dead Reckoning, but I find it hard to argue when their music is just so fucking good. They are top tier prog metal. Damian Wilson is a powerhouse of a vocalist.

[Scar Symmetry - The Singularity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NsFx6iVOaA)

This is the best disc they've done since they lost Christian. Anyone looking to dip into the melodic death genre a la Soilwork should start here. They have the lushest melodies this side of progpower.

[Evergrey - Hymns For The Broken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK0G74RcIBM)

Evergrey is like Edguy in the fact that their last few albums have been totally lackluster. The Glorious Collision was in the right direction but still lacking. This disc puts them right back where they belong and it sounds like a logical follow-up to The Inner Circle, which was their last good disc until this showed up.

[Viathyn - Cynosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDL26Jl-Vt4)

I just fucking love when a rookie band comes from nowhere and releases a stellar album. The Falconer influence is everywhere and that's a good thing. 

[Adamantra - Act II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNxldP3qptY)

These guys if you didn't know rose from the ashes of Bride Adorned. Bride Adorned put out one of the finest symphonic metal albums ever made IMO. I'm glad they basically kept a lot of what was good from BA and transferred it to another band. The Finns as usual have top notch production sensibilities which helps considered the layers upon layers of nuances in every song.

[Sabaton - Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHg5LW3R3Pg)

You all knew this was going to be here. They've been on every list I've done since they started releasing superb quality albums (starting with The Art of War, I felt everything before that was spotty). Night Witches is a fucking blazer of an opener. Anyone who hears this song first is instantly sold on the album. I could go on and on about this album being amazing, but I'll just leave it with my only gripe being that the album is a tad short!

[Voyager - V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZqx-zirNf4)

Their jump to djent was not without it's missteps, but it's ultimately a quality album. It's not as good as the masterful Meaning of I, but it's rare when a band is album to match something like that. Go listen to the song [Broken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EkU3tMs4c) and you'll see what I mean. Don't let that deter you, dive right in and be amazed with talent of constructing a captivating melody, along with having the distinction of having no one else sounding like them.

DISC OF THE YEAR

[Dynazty - Renatus](http://youtu.be/LlXBwsgcQ70?list=PLm2qJi599_Q12Y9NEGHZEsm2wWEX00gxp)

These guys were amazing AOR/Hard Rock anyways, but then they decided ""fuck it, let's get faster, heavier, and better"". And they did! They genre jumped like fucking champs making it look easy and like they have been doing it all their lives. After hearing Starlight it immediately got added to my gym playlist. Hell, if you need motivation to get shit done throw this album in the player and go do a few more sets. 


"
"My favorite albums of 2014","&gt; Night Witches is a fucking blazer of an opener. Anyone who hears this song first is instantly sold on the album.

Funny story about that song - when I saw them with Amon Amarth in October ([link to setlist](http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/sabaton/2014/upstate-concert-hall-clifton-park-ny-3ccf18f.html)), there was a guy in the audience wearing a WWII helmet - he would hold up a flag for the country that the song was referencing... and he did it for EVERY song.

By the end of the 3rd song, Joakim caught on to what he was doing - he pointed the guy out to the crowd, said ""you got our setlist, didn't you"" and the crowd started laughing (they're so fucking good interacting with the crowd).  Then, Joakim said ""well, let's see what happens if we change that up a little"" and started playing Night Witches (which wasn't on the other show setlists).  No other songs were about Russia, so when the dude held up a Russian Flag, the band members all just burst out laughing.  They also teased us later in the set by doing the intro and a little of the opening verse of Master of Puppets... then they stopped and I almost shed a tear (they could have pulled it off easily)...

Best show I've ever been to (Amon Amarth was also incredible, as expected).  When they were done, they said they would definitely be back.  I also heard a bunch of people on the way out talking about how they hadn't heard of Sabaton before and how much they kicked ass - can't wait for them to come back around.  I had a stiff neck and a sore throat for two days after that show."
"My favorite albums of 2014","They are crazy good live. I saw them in Glasgow and there was a guy who looked exactly like Joakim in the audience. Joakim said they would only play one (and only one) song from Coat of Arms, and they decided to let the lookalike choose between Screaming Eagles and Uprising. The guy chose White Death. They compiled. "
"My favorite albums of 2014","I went for all three bands (Skeletonwitch had van problems, so they had to cancel unfortunately), but Sabaton was who I was most excited to see and they just fucking killed it.  They also did the whole ""bring a kid on stage and give him aviators"" thing, and it was awesome - the kid had the biggest smile on his face afterward.

As the night was winding down, Amon Amarth was almost at the end of their allotted time and they're known to have the same two encore songs: Twilight of the Thunder God and Pursuit of Vikings (my two favorites, in backward order).  It seemed like they weren't going to have enough time at first, but they ignored the staff and did them anyway - I screamed both songs in their entirety, it was a perfect ending to an incredible night.

The funny thing about the show was that neither band had been to upstate NY before, and neither knew how they would be received - as it turns out, the crowd was fucking phenomenal and both bands knew it.  Thank God - at least we have the promise of some excellent shows down the road."

"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","###Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove  
All right, it's time for my **Powerglove** review! Took me a while to put together, because I've got no WiFi in my own apartment yet and I'm leeching off the neighbour's WiFi, which gives me a 1-stripe signal and it only works 20% of the time, and slowly to boot. ANYWAY. I've really looked forward to doing this band, being an avid gamer and all. Ironically, it was just pointed out to me that I primarily focus on the vocals of music, so let's see how it goes with an all instrumental band!

Oh and I changed the headers to black, now they don't look like links (thanks to /u/MadTheMad for the suggestion).

*****  
###About the band  
**Genre**: Power Metal  
**Country**: US

Powerglove is, with one or two exceptions, an all-instrumental power metal band that makes its own renditions of beloved video game soundtracks and TV show theme songs. An awesome premise! Quite often, they are being pretty creative with the material and end up creating something of their own. Great in some cases, but in a select few cases I would have preferred it if they stayed more true to the source material. I'll explain what I mean when we come to the tracks I'm talking about.

The band has one extended play, called Total Pwnage, which was released in 2005. They've got two full albums, one focusing on video game soundtracks (Metal Kombat for the Mortal Man, 2007) while the other focuses on cartoon theme songs (Saturday Morning Apocalypse, 2010). In addition to that, they've got two remix albums. These remix albums consist partly of old tracks and new, improved versions of old tracks (primarily from the EP). The first one, ""TV Game Metal"" was released in 2012 (Japan only) and has 4 revisited tracks. The second one, ""Video Game Metal"", was released digitally this year and has two or three revisited tracks. I can't find any YouTube uploads of the latest remix album, with the exception of one of the remixed tracks.
*****  
###Total Pwnage (EP, 2005)

Total Pwnage marks the band's debut, and consists of seven tracks total. As is often the case with debut albums, the production quality is quite low. To reuse my line from my thoughts about Dark Moor's debut album, the drums sound like someone is hammering on frickin' Ikea boxes. It's not necessarily as bad as many other crappy debut albums, but considering most of the tracks have gotten a remix later on, it's a much better idea to go listen to those. If you're still interested in hearing some of the stuff that is on this EP, you could always check out [Tetris (Themes B and C)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trGkPerU3-k) (remixed on 2014 release), or [Mute City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OUkexdBXP8) (only non-remixed track at this point). Other than that, I wouldn't really bother with this EP.

*****  
###Metal Kombat for the Mortal Man (2007)  
Playlist additions:

* [Omnishred (We're Gonna Need a Bigger Sword)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH9u3wpmxwA) - Final Fantasy VII boss theme  
* [Red Wings over Baron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n01JYXwxkeo) - Final Fantasy IV medley

This album, which consists of powermetalized video game soundtracks, sees two playlist additions. Both are from the Final Fantasy franchise. I think that says more about Nobuo Uematsu, the composer of all the soundtracks in the franchise, than it says about the album itself. What I mean is, when you're basing your work upon existing work, the quality of the source material is a significant factor for the outcome. And if you've ever played a Final Fantasy game, you would probably agree on that the franchise has nothing short of fantastic soundtracks.

**Omnishred** is the boss battle theme from Final Fantasy VII. Powerglove stays relatively close to the original soundtrack in terms of structure, except the segment from 1:38 to 2:23, which is of their own creation. This segment feels somewhat disconnected from the rest, jarring the intensity of the song just a little. It didn't need to be there. Its absence would make the song a lot shorter, but they could have opted to repeat the melody another time instead. Despite this minor annoyance, it is still the best version I've ever heard. The intro riff is inherently explosive and badass, and 0:39 - 0:50 is my favorite part, and 0:50 - 1:38 is incredible as well. While some credit should go to the original composer, Powerglove did a really good job with this one. You can compare it to the original soundtrack, as well as the Black Mages version (a band consisting of three of Square's composers, Uematsu being one of them).

* [Original soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVBM3bX7xdw)  
* [Black Mages version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzFh9GuE0rA)

**Red Wings over Baron** is a Final Fantasy IV medley, taking melodies from multiple parts of the game. The beginning of the intro is of Powerglove's own creation. 0:23 - 1:07 is the characteristic ""Red Wings"" theme. 1:08 - 1:55 is the standard battle theme. For a specific part of the melody here, which is repeated quite a few times, Powerglove experiments with two different drum paces. It is the slower one of the two that really hits the spot (1:35 - 1:38, as opposed to 1:41 - 1:44). 1:55 - 2:36 is the ""Four Fiends"" theme, which is also pretty cool. 3:08 to 4:05 is a calm segment replicating the cave music of the game, and sounds nearly identical to what it does in the game. The boss theme starts at 4:15, but doesn't really kick off until 4:38, and lasts till 5:22. After that, the victory theme common to the entire franchise is played for a little while, followed by some of Powerglove's own stuff, and finished off by a segment from Powerglove that I actually like a lot, from 6:29 and onwards. All in all, the song could have been slightly more compact, but it contains so many fantastic melodies from a good old game that it is easily some of Powerglove's best work. For the interested, here are the original soundtracks. The Black Mages has their own version of the Four Fiends theme, and perhaps of the other ones too (couldn't find any using a quick search).

Well, this is getting long-winded! I'll just list the additional songs on this album that are worth checking out:

###Saturday Morning Apocalypse (2010)  
Playlist additions:

* [Gotta Catch 'em All (Ft. Tony Kakko)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev3VwmpBXyo) - (Pokemon theme song)

This album consists of powermetalized cartoon theme songs. I'll just tell you right away that I'm less fond of this album compared to Metal Kombat for the Mortal Man. I'm not sure if it's a generally poor selection of source material, or the fact that I didn't watch many cartoons as a kid, or that cartoon theme songs are just less sophisticated than video game soundtracks. A little bit of each one, perhaps? Anyway, there's one song on this album that I really like, and it's the, brace yourselves, POKEMON THEME SONG!

**Gotta Catch 'em All (Ft. Tony Kakko)** is the theme song of the cartoon/anime/whatever that was so insanely popular back in the day (now it's all shit, I hear). That's not the best part, though - it features vocals by none other than Tony motherfucking Kakko of Sonata Arctica! And trust me, that's what makes this song awesome. Chances are you (used to) like Pokemon, so this song is bound to tickle your inner nerd. And if you didn't, chances are you're thinking ""laaaame"" right now. But hear me out. Forget that this is the Pokemon theme song. You like Sonata Arctica, right? Of course you do. So think of this song as a (somewhat strange, I'll give you that) Sonata Arctica song. You with me? Aight. Let's get to the actual song. It gets progressively better as the song goes through the three verses - each verse is better than the previous one. This fact has nothing to do with the vocals, it is the *drums* that get better. The first verse (0:06 - 0:26) has what seems to me as senseless, chaotic drumming. I see this a lot in this genre... hammering on the drums as fast as you can, or adding computer-generated ""machine gun"" drums. On rare occasions, that works, but most of the time it doesn't really. It gets better already during the chorus. In the second verse, they manage to slow down and actually getting a drum beat with a power vibe (1:15 - 1:20, specifically). A short burst of awesomeness. Worry not, it'll come back stronger in the third verse. Before that, though, there's an awesome vocal hook (1:46 - 1:58) where Tony Kakko is shouting ""Gotta catch 'em all"" 6 times. After that, there's a guitar solo. Nothing stellar, but it still stands out since the guitars in the rest of the song are drowned out by the vocals. A pretty badass riff from 2:17 to 2:33 precedes the final verse, where the drums finally reach perfection. You can compare it the original theme song, or to Powerglove's non-vocal version:

* [Original soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuYeHPFR3f0)  
* [Powerglove, non-vocals version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_emC3mSz_6E) (sucks without Tony, eh?)

As for the rest of the album, there's really not that much to tell. My second favorite track would be X-men, and Transformers is also worth checking out. The Simpsons *does have vocals*, also by Tony Kakko. All he says is ""The Simpsons"" at the beginning, though.

### TV Game Metal (2012)  
Playlist additions:

* [The Decisive Battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JzK6IbLbs) (Final Fantasy VI boss theme)  
* [Birth of a God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub_RAbeZMjk) (Final Fantasy VII, Bizarro Sephiroth theme)  
* [Dr. Wily Stage 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R98rj-T48Mc) (Mega Man II)

This is the first remix album, and perhaps oddly the one to provide the most playlist additions. The album has 10 tracks, and 3 of these are all 3 previous playlist additions: Omnishred, Red Wings over Baron, and Gotta Catch 'em All (Ft. Tony Kakko). It also features, non-remixed, Holy Orders, The Simpsons, and Bloody Tears / Beginning (which is identical to Vanquish the Horrible Night). The *juice of the album*, though, are the remixed tracks. There are four of these, and 3 of them warranted a playlist addition. The exception would be Storm Eagled Battle, which is still pretty good despite not being put on the playlist.

**The Decisive Battle** is the boss soundtrack of Final Fantasy VI. It appeared on the EP, but this version is infinitely better. Powerglove stays pretty much true to the original soundtrack (minus a few new riffs). Honestly, I can't really say much more about this track, other than that it's goddamn awesome. I'm not being lazy, it's just awesome through and through and I don't think I need to justify why it was added.

* [Original soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb-Lhkm93pI)  
* [Black Mages version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHJe_Te8D5g)  
* [EP version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb31vfYuXfs)

**Birth of a God** is the soundtrack that goes with *Bizarro Sephiroth*, one of FFVII's final boss' forms. I actually had to upload this one to YT myself, since this remixed version was not uploaded by anyone yet. It appeared on the EP as well, and again, this version is infinitely better. My only complaint is that they miss a note at a specific point (0:48 - 0:51 and 0:54 - 0:57, and whenever this part is repeated). That even almost makes me prefer the original soundtrack. But I really do dig this version, because of the segments between 0:59 and 2:10, as well as 2:41 - 3:14. Here the song is brimming with power and sounds even better than the original soundtrack.

* [Original soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H8_2vEb6PU)  
* [EP version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAiOAhp_Llc)

**Dr. Wily Stage 1** is the soundtrack to 2 or 3 of the Dr Wily stages at the end of Mega Man II (not just Stage 1...). This particular soundtrack has got to be the best one to ever grace the ol' Nintendo, and Powerglove does a good job translating it into power metal. The parts that are taken from the actual soundtrack are between 0:00 and 0:51, 1:03 - 1:35, as well as the final segment. So, Powerglove throws some new riffs in there. They're okay. All in all, a really good rendition of a really great soundtrack.

* [Nirreman + Lee Duffy's version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXQ2a-K1QRo) (non-power, used to be my go-to Dr Wily theme)

To conclude, this remix album is all you really need from Powerglove. It has the three most listenworthy tracks from the previous albums, 3 other tracks from previous albums, and 4 really good remixes of some of the stuff that was on the EP. As for *getting a hold* of this album, that's a toughie. Apparently it was a Japan only release. It *is* available for digital purchase, though, via the big digital music stores. So it's either that or import, I guess. Oh yeah, don't forget to also check out Stormed Eagle Battle, it's decent.

###Video Game Metal (2014)    
Okay, can't talk much about this release since the post is too long for reddit otherwise. Digital release only, remixed version of tetris and the [Power Rangers Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5RKhoChXZg). Apparently also a remixed Duck Grinder, although I can't hear the difference on Amazon previews. The rest are old tracks, so it's not really an interesting release anyway.

*****  
###Conclusion
Powerglove is a great band, particularly for gamers. Even if you aren't one, I can guarantee that you find something you like. 4 playlist additions from Final Fantasy games (thank you Uematsu), one from Mega Man II, and one Pokemon theme song. Hope you enjoyed this review! Please list your own favorites, I'm very curious how biased I was (since I have played the games of all the playlist additions). I don't have space for the whole series summary, but you can find that in the [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2mbesf/discovering_power_metal_dark_moor/)."
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","It was cool seeing them live, but they sounded a bit mushy so it wasn't great. Fun band, though. FF9 battle is where it's at anyway. :p

"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","Oh yeah, you posted this a while back. Pretty cool soundtrack, now I want to go play FF9. It's PS1 right?"
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","PS1, PSP, emulators, etc."
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","God bless emulators. "
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","This is the kind of bands that everyone just have their favorites and everybody is naturally drawn to the covers of the games they played or shows they watched. I can see you're a Final Fantasy player and so you take a liking of those songs.

I'd say my favorite is The Simpsons one, it's so fucking whacky and i think that it's just really well done. Gotta Catch em all is also really great and my nostalgia nerves just start tingling when i heard the melody.

I'm more flabbergasted that the guys from Powerglove somehow managed to get Kakko on their songs."
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","SA took them on tour. They must get along. :p"
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","Yeah pretty much. Really though, that Final Fantasy composer is a genius.

It's ridiculous, I'm imagining Kakko sitting with his Game Boy and Pokemon Red, training his Charizard. "
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","How Storm Eagle did not make the list is open to debate, but lets put it this way;

* The song on its own; not bad
* The song if you've seen the band live; best song ever!

This is mostly due to the chant of ""Fuck That Bird"" during the song.

[Case and Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZzwWsyIdDk)

But everyone is going to have a dispute over what's considered the best tracks depending on what was considered their ""fandom"".

Also, any word on what the next band will be or is that a surprise? (either that or I skipped it somehow)"
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","Yeah. I didn't really check out any live videos. Awesome chant, though, I'd really love to see Powerglove live some time. Dunno if they ever tour in Europe...

Do you generally agree with the rest of the additions, though? They're all great in my eyes, but that's partly because I played all those games. On the other hand, I also played Mega Man X and most of the other games they've covered.

I would have added the upcoming bands, but I was over the character limit. Anyway, I'll be doing Dragonland next."
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","I agree with most of what's up there. Storm Eagle aside, everything looks good except maybe Gotta Catch 'Em All, but this is current me rating it, not 13 year old me rating the original theme. I'd add Inspector Gadget and Johnny Quest but you basically nailed all the good tracks from their 2nd album.

Also, looking forward to Dragonland since I only know one, maybe two albums by them, so I'm always looking to see what's recommended or what to stay away from."
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","I saw them open for DragonForce and Turisas. "
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","Cool! 3 bands I really wanna see. "
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","I class them /r/videogamemetal and less power metal. "
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","The world classes them as both."
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","I meant to type *more* vg than power."
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","That's reasonable.

I listened to their EP when it came out way back when. When that pokemon song was released years later I went nuts due to the Tony appearance. Never would have expected that."
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","Ahh yeah me too, caught them back on MySpace and got the EP shaped like a PS2 game case and a tshirt. MUST see them live one day"
"Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove","I'm going to skip the writeup and just say that I don't enjoy these guys. I'm all in favour of gimmicks and all that cool stuff, but this just doesn't work for me (and I'm a gamer too). I saw these guys open for HammerFall and it was pretty disappointing. I wish they had taken a better band on tour with them."

**SinuataBouquet's Recommendation of the Week**

Alright, so there's essentially one power metal album coming up, so give it up for **Pythia**! I thought it was neat. I was really in the mood for some fast power when I listened to this, so I pretty much got what I asked for. They seem like a fairly solid band overall.

As for last week, turns out I missed that PelleK released his new album. I know /u/realkman666 and /u/mushmancat are extremely pumped for this, go [buy your signed copy here](http://pellek.com/).

**Highlight of the Week**

You all know Epica. Simone Simons is all over the place on the metal scene, and they have built up quite a name for themselves. In May this year they released their seventh full-length album. I listened to Design Your Universe a bit back in the days, but haven't really caught up with them entirely. In my quest for epic instrumentals, I found one on their recent album. [That shit's majestic](http://youtu.be/Mc9p4N8QBaw). They promoted the album, _The Quantic Enigma_, with a partly progressive, heavy and occasionally epic tune called [The Essence of Silence](http://youtu.be/oePrtEMmX9Y). Have a listen!

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","So, like I said last week, I'm gonna give this ""first impressions"" thing a shot, mainly because I want to make sure I don't miss anything crazy good in the last few weeks, and because I don't want to miss anything crazy good when the new year begins. So I'm gonna do this is the memory of /u/MisterMillennia - [rest in peace](http://www.memegene.net/media/created/1xuhv8.jpg). So before I start ""reviewing"" anything, I think I should note that I'm incredibly un-picky when it comes to my metal. By that, I mean I can listen to any vocal styles, any weird EDM fusions, or even rap parts (Within Temptation reference...). Let's get to it.

My opinions (based upon previews only):

* **Pythia:** Jesus, I never thought I could hear such a good Nightwish clone. Bands like Diabulus in Musica and Xandria are pretty similar to Oceanborn-era Nightwish, but this is almost identical, and it's REALLY GOOD. I'm surprised that they go with the whole D&amp;D lyrical themes, since most of these bands tend to be more gothic with their lyrics, but the music is incredible. I went ahead and checked out another track from the album, ""[Sword of Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR8VoVoSXso)"", and I'm just convinced further that this album could very well displace someone on my top 10 list of 2014. 

What I missed last week (I wasn't even here, you dicks):

* **Starbynary:** I didn't know why you didn't just link to YouTube for this one; the whole album is already available there (which you can find [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZtgCsRDXvWSaWgHiMi9TF5FMxjclUKNR)). ""Dark Passenger"" was kind of boring, much like many of the prog/power metal bands I end up hearing nowadays (*cough* Majesty of Revival *cough*). The singing and instrumentation is competent enough, but not so much the songwriting. Now, as for ""The Ritual - Modus Operandi -"", that's a much better track, mostly because the agonizing subtlety is removed, and it's just a much more straightforward power metal song. I'm getting a weird Power Quest vibe from a lot of the songs, and I'm not a Power Quest fan, but this second track isn't too shabby. The main hook is great and catchy, albeit a little generic Europower-y. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this isn't essential listening for this week, but it might appeal to some people who really like their cheese-smothered power metal.

* **Unseelie:** Hey, a name I **don't** recognize! And that artwork is fantastic; it definitely reminds me of something like Mirror's Edge, but this track is a little odd. It sounds more like [Angelzoom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsaIYs4Zjc8) than a metal track (Angelzoom is awesome, though). Supposedly, this is a concept album, though, so I don't think it's fair to judge the album from just this one track - it could be a transitional piece. So I decided to check out the album opener, ""[Strangers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_ssXDZCfyY)"". It's definitely more ""metal""; it's even got some harsh vocals towards the end. It looks like this band's forte is atmospheric songs, so in that regard, it's pretty good, but it's not something I'd ever actively listen to. Maybe it'd make for good background music while studying?

* **PelleK:** Oh, everyone's favorite. I actually didn't think *Ocean of Opportunity* was all that bad, but I generally try to steer clear of his covers and Christmas songs. But this title track is pretty boring. PelleK, like always, makes sure to showcase his singing, but not much else is going on. Also, what's up with that video's aspect ratio? It's not a great first impression, especially for us power metal fans, but I would like to hear more from the album before I totally dismiss it. So I decided to check out ""[Tempest](http://vmuzike.net/song/pellek/Tempest)"", and it's honestly not that bad. The symphonic passages are pretty epic to say the least, and it's about on par with PelleK's material with Damnation Angels. It's pretty fast, and PelleK seems to actually be using some restraint on his vocals...wait, I spoke too soon. I'll probably give this one a listen sometime this week just to hear how the rest of the album fares. But I would definitely recommend you guys to listen to something other than the title track if you're not impressed with it. It's nothing compared to ""Northern Wafer"" though.

/u/SinuataBouquet's highlight:

* **Epica - ""The Fifth Guardian (Interlude)"":** - Shit's epic. Three thumbs up. It almost sounds like the melody from [White Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l35sLxu-XJ4) at some points.

* **Epica - ""The Essence of Silence"":** Wasn't this the first single they released from the album? I remember listening to it and getting pumped up, because I did not like *Requiem for the Indifferent* at all. But this track sounds like something taken straight from *The Phantom Agony*, and that right there is a good thing. Mark's grunts work so well alongside Simone's operatic leads, and the song is fueled and intense, especially for Epica. Along with *Sacrificium* and *Argia*, this album is definitely recommended to anyone who likes female-fronted symphonic metal. But then again, it's Epica; a certain level of professionalism and talent is to be expected, and it's delivered in spades on this track. My favorite from this album has to be ""[Victims of Contingency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7IIYIFljZM)"", though. And they even made a video for it pretty recently!

Well, there was my first ""impressions"" review. If you have any comments, hatred, misogyny, death threats, or marriage proposals for me, I welcome them."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","Hey, /u/SinuataBouquet, you forgot [this release](http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Light_Bringer/The_Light_Brings_the_Past_Scenes/472580). It's a DVD release, and I can't find any preview links for it, but I'd still include it. Light Bringer is awesome."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","Right Brigaru ah DVD? Ooooh astanemasta!"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","I'm ok with some of PelleKs solo stuff, i just kinda wish some of it was better. It's such a shame because he really is a really fucking good singer."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","&gt;  a really fucking good singer

&lt;_&gt;"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","I don't know why people don't like PelleK, but I love him.

It does bring up a point that needs to be addressed here though: there are ways to criticise a band and ways not to; it seems that if somebody here doesn't like a band or a singer they feel the need to act like a dick about it. You guys know who you are. Remember, people are allowed their own opinions and shouldn't receive condescension or barely-veiled abuse because of it.

/u/Fazermint saying that PelleK should shoot himself in the mouth is both stupid and disrespectful, even if it was said in jest and is one such example of what I'm talking about. There's no reason why we can't have respectful discussions around here."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","Fair is fair. I'll ease up on the jokes. (Is saying that Blodwen gives you bleeding ears also too far?)

I appreciate that you called me on this. I avoid bashing people for having opinions, since I hate when that happens to me. It won't keep me from saying I think a particular release is horrible, but I'll keep in mind to not use such vulgar jokes."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","Thanks for saying that."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","I enjoy your boyfriend's singing, but there's no doubt about how bad he is most of the time. "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","Fazermint signing in. A single-release week? This should be quick.

* **Pythia**: What exactly makes something ""gothic""? That genre specification is lost on me, PM is PM. As for the preview, it's pretty cool! Nothing to complain about regarding the vocalist's soprano voice, it's very good. The music is nice and fast, definitely a release I'll look into.  
* **Starbynary**: Two songs in this preview. The first one (Dark Passenger) is pretty boring for progressive metal, and lacks the power vibe. The second one (Dawn of Evil) already sounds a lot better. It isn't mind-blowing stuff, but at least check out this second track.  
* **Unseelie**: Not a very metally track, and it hardly contains any symphonic elements at all. I mean there's synthesizers at one point, that's all. Sure, the woman can sing, but I'd hardly call this symphonic metal.  
* **PelleK**: /u/Mushmancat 's favorite band! Holy shit what is this crap doing on a metal sub. That singer should shoot himself in the mouth. Mushmancat I'm sorry for dissing your top 10 worst bands post, PelleK is exorbitantly crappy. I do like Machinae Supremacy, though. Don't hate me.

So, clearly, Pythia is the best release in this post. I appreciate the paragraph on Epica, as I haven't been following their latest releases either. The Fifth Guardian sure is serenity-inducing. Mixed feelings about The Essence of Silence (and Epica in general, really), because they mix soprano with growling. These are two opposite extremes, and they don't really feel congruent to me. I think Epica's much better when the growling is kept to a minimum (WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT THAT). Out of the top of my head, [Storm the Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNoTvg0t52c) would be my favorite Epica track (not that I've listened to them extensively)."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","Well, if you have the time, will you explain what's so much better about Machinae Supremacy?

I only ask because i think they're a steaming pile of pop/rock shit and note, i only heard the last album."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","While Machinae Supremacy's two latest albums have been pretty bad, much of their older stuff is pretty good. I didn't even listen to their latest album because the previews sounded so bad. So, that's a fair opinion.

It can be difficult to get into the guy's voice. Still, they've put out some solid stuff. Try [Fury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQusmFshoU8), a pretty fucking sick track. [Thorugh the Looking Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXzHSxYvg-I) is also fantastic. If you want an entire album to check out, I'd say their best one is A View to the End of the World (their last good album). The most notable tracks are the [Title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWTyjXYo_Z8), [Nova Prospect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68hxUjT2Ong), [Rocket Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph_8XslAtwE), and [Force Feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajRvfKLU2b4). 

It is definitely not every PM fan's cup of tea. It's not the standard PM stuff, so I get that it's not that popular on this sub. What do you think about the tracks I listed? Still shit? :p"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","Just from a quick glance at the tracks, the ones from ""the last good album"" are okay songs but i think that no matter how good the instrumentation was on the songs, i would still dislike it just because of the vocals. Not only is the vocalist... bad (read horrible/awful/shitbad), he also manages to sound very amateur with the style he sings and the breathing between lines.

Truly not my cup of tea... Thank you for the time you took to answer the question and the links provided."

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","If PelleK had more reasonable prices, I'd be all over that. He rocks hard (in his head) and shreds like a mofo (on video).

Pythia is pretty great, like Dutch GrrrMetal but not boring, a bit of a NW vibe but not pretentious.  

And the French will never accept that their English is painful. Still makes you think of ToT 1.0"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)","Am I the only one getting annoyed by those keyboard parts (I think? I'm not good with instruments) in the Pythia preview? I don't really know how to explain the sound but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. It's first used at 0:42, and is played like every 3 seconds after that. 

It feels really out of place and just straight out annoys me, and it's ruining the song for me. I do like all the other aspects of it though, which is a shame."

"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","###Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly
Fellow warriors, today we will be looking at a band with a weird-ass name. Neonfly. Neon, fly. What? That must be the most un-metal band name I've ever heard. Don't be fooled, though. These guys can pull some serious tunes!

I just had the last exam of my life. I've got nothing booked for next week, as I'm awaiting a thesis interview. What does that mean for you? Avantasia write-up before the end of next week! WOOOOO. AVANTASIAAAAA!

*****  
###About the band  
**Genre**: Melodic Power Metal  
**Country**: UK

As the name might reveal, Neonfly isn't a heavy and dark band at all. Their most distinct characteristics are their solid melodic instrumentation and the glam-rock voice of their vocalist, Willy Norton. They debuted in 2008 with an EP, but didn't get a full album released before 2011. Just before the end of 2014, they released their second album, which was positively received by many of us here on /r/PowerMetal.

While Neonfly is not a very guitar-oriented band, their music is still utilizing guitars to carry their songs along. It generally stays in the background, though, save for guitar solos in most of their songs. These guitar solos are usually nothing to write home about. However, the non-guitar instrumentation is very good, especially on their second album.

Instrumentation aside, the voice... damn. The vocal style that Norton uses is usually found in glam rock bands. To combine it with power metal instrumentation feels incredibly fresh, and as an enthusiast of both genres, I can only say *hell yes*. Norton has a powerhouse of a voice. If he made music in the fourth quarter of the 20th century, he would no doubt stand as a beloved classic together with Freddie Mercury, Klaus Meine, and all those folks. Sadly though, Power Metal is a criminally underrated music genre, and even within the genre, Neonfly will probably stay under the radar. Well, this review is an effort to generate some well-deserved attention their way!

Line-up:

* **Paul Miller**: Bass guitarist  
* **Frederick Thunder**: Guitarist  
* **Patrick Harrington**: Guitarist

###Outshine the Sun (2011)  
A very ambitious album name, and in terms of radiating energy and positivity, the album does the name justice. This album has a big hard rock influence, and while I can barely find any tracks *not* worth naming, I can only recommend listening to this album if you also enjoy regular hard rock and glam rock. Power Metal purists won't find what they're looking for here. If that doesn't scare you off, then by all means. It's a very solid debut album, the quality level is definitely high. Even so, I couldn't find an isolated track that is a must-listen. Hence the lack of a playlist addition from this album. Still wholeheartedly recommended! Let's dive in:

* [Broken Wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iN6MwsdFSQ)  
* [The Enemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3EBS4QZ1M8)  
* [Ship with no Sails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGIWszVeUv0)  
* [A Gift to Remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AW_NzNarEc)  
* [The Revenant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f04io8ERRm0)  
* [The Ornament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V12wWggTKg)  
* [Reality Shift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD-7gVzlAkI)  
* [Spitting Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g685N9fwDN4)  
* [Morning Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpR_F-mVkjs)  
* [The Messenger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOPbOHdFO1E)  
* [I Think I Saw a UFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9emk9x4qJA)

The album doesn't suffer from a pointless intro, but kicks right off with a self-contained track. ""Broken Wings"" is quite catchy, nicely fast, and should tell you pretty much what to expect from this album. The next songs have a more melodic touch, as is immediately evident in the sweet intro guitar riff of ""The Enemy"". The song maintains a fast pace and has great vocals.  
""Ship with no Sails"" has starts off with a cool bass riff, then goes into a video game-like guitar riff. Pretty great stuff. In this song, the vocal style deviates a little bit from the glam rock style, as it sounds a little more like modern alternative rock. I personally like that less, but the chorus is so damn great that it more than makes up for it.  
""A Gift to Remember"" takes on a hard-rock vibe. As such, it is the first slower-paced song on the album. It's pretty catchy (noticing a trend), and the slow pace allows for the vocals to become a lot more prominent. They already were, of course, but this song really showcases what Norton can do. 1:30 - 1:45 is genuinely awesome in that respect.  
""The Revenant"" has a heavy and intense guitar intro, and it's awesome. Beyond that, it sounds very similar to the rest of the album. This song does have the coolest guitar solo of the album at around 2:45, so there's that.  
""The Ornament"" is an instrumental-only track. It's very cool, but ends up being less memorable because of that fact.  
""Reality Shift"" is very fast and a tad heavier than the rest. This is the song that sounds the most like a traditional power metal song. It's definitely headbangalicious, but it sounds a little bit unpolished vocals-wise. Still a very nice track. The last minute is a guitar solo segment, a really interesting way of finishing a song.  
""Spitting Blood"" goes back to having a classic hard rock vibe. The instrumentation isn't very interesting here, and the chorus is easily the most memorable part of the song. The guitar solo, while short-ish, is pretty cool as well.  
The next two songs are the only two that don't kick major ass. ""Morning Star"" has some oriental sounds in their intro, a little out of place but whatever. The instrumentation is okay, but the vocals are less merry and catchy, making me like this song a little less. ""The Messenger"" is a slow song, and suffers because of that fact. The vocals are good, but the song is too boring to keep my interest.  
Luckily, the album has a great finish. ""I Think I Saw a UFO"", quite the wacky title, goes back to being a fast-paced hard rock-influenced song with great, catchy vocals. Like with ""Ship with no Sails"", the vocal style leans a little bit toward modern alternative rock. It's still cool, and definitely the quirkiest song on the album. The ending is wtf.

###Strangers in Paradise (2014)  
Strangers in Paradise, while still having a noticeable hard rock vibe to it, this album feels a lot more like Power Metal. It's a lot more diverse than the first album, which can be refreshing on the one side, but on the other hand I might have wanted more songs like ""Heart of the Sun"". Let's dive in!

* [Whispered Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYiCTRsoTuQ)  
* [Highways to Nowhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFauncPjRow)  
* [Better Angels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ngt3Z33m8U) (acoustic, only one I could find)  
* Rose in Bloom (no vids)  
* [Heart of the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmiMP8zwyKs)  
* [Aztec Gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo4vHxWy8AQ)  
* Fierce Battalions (no vids)  
* [Sons of Liberty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGpkPYp1rR4)  
* [Chasing the Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWFlfI-yHdQ) (uploaded this for you, sexy bastards)  
* [Falling Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOG8NULIkr0)

""Whispered Dreams"" is a nice opening song. It sounds much like a song right off the debut album. You can notice, though, that the focus has shifted a little towards melodic sounds. The instrumental segment between 1:55 - 2:45 sees some nice guitar riffs and some melodic parts, pretty cool and full of energy. The vocals don't disappoint, either.  
The opening song is followed by a song that throws you a bit out of whack. The always-positive, happy sound of Neonfly suddenly changes dramatically in what I can only characterize as some sort of punk rock track. ""Highways to Nowhere"" has vocals that are harsher than normally, sometimes bordering on the unclean. As a punk rock song, the instrumentation is basically just noise. A very surprising song that I don't care for.  
Luckily, though, this change is reverted again in the next track, ""Better Angels"". It's a slower-paced song with decent vocals and a pretty great chorus. ""Rose in Bloom"" is even calmer. It's a warm and fuzzy song, for those moments when you need some feel-good vibes to calm down instead of getting hopped up on fast power metal.  
Then we get to Neonfly's ultimate song, **""Heart of the Sun""**. This song is absolutely awesome. It's their catchiest song. It's the song with the most prominent melodic vibe. And the vocals are fantastic. This song NEEDS to go down as a Power Metal legend. In five years, people should repost this song and go ""remember this gem?"" Because really, holy shit. It's not an intensely fast song, that's not what makes me go holy shit. It just bursts with energy, and it just doesn't stop. The melodic intro is delicious, and man, when those guitars and drums kick in, you know you're in for a treat. Then the vocals start, sounding great as always. At first it doesn't seem very different from other tracks, but somewhere down the line (chorus build-up, chorus), you realize this is their catchiest song. The instrumentation stays awesome, with melodic sounds throughout the whole song and kick-ass drums. After 2:50, the song suddenly enters a really awesome segment, in what must be the greatest musical bridge in power metal. *I don't want no last chance, bring it on, I'll advance and chase my, FREEDOOOM! FREEDOOOOOM!* Hence the holy shit.  
""Aztec Gold"" sounds a bit like a continuation of ""Heart of the Sun"". It's an all-instrumental track, seeing some nice guitars and even the return of the melodic segment so characteristic of ""Heart of the Sun"". It's pretty cool for what it is.  
Then we get back to regular tracks with ""Fierce Battalions"". Decent melodic intro, after which we're thrown into one of their heavier tracks. The vocals are slightly rougher than usually, but not to the extent of ""Highways to Nowhere"". It's definitely a decent track, and the guitar solo is really short but really cool.  
""Sons of Liberty"" is another track that sounds like it could have been on the first album, at least in terms of vocals. The chorus is pretty catchy, and the instrumentation is all right. It pretty much follows the formula that Neonfly has established for themselves by now.  
""Chasing the Night"" is probably my second favorite song from these guys. A really great, catchy song. I absolutely dig the chorus buildup and the chorus itself. Not quite interesting enough instrumentation-wise to warrant a playlist addition though. The guitar solo is cool, though. It's more like... If I added this one to the playlist, then I'd have to add more songs too because they're about as great as this one. It'd all become a big mess. Does this make sense to you?  
The album finishes off with a feel-good song. ""Falling Star"" is a calm song, sounding like kind of a send-off, like something that would play during the ending of a movie. And while it SOUNDS like he's singing ""*You're far away like a porn star, baby*"", you can rest assured because he's saying ""falling star"", not ""porn star"". It's pretty sweet, tying the knot on a pretty unique album.
*****  
###Conclusion  
Neonfly turned out to be quite awesome, right? Within the Power Metal genre, Neonfly has a pretty unique sound, with its hard-rock influences. Norton's glam-rock voice is easily the best feature of this band, although the instrumentation is very solid. The first album is a solid outing, being somewhere between a Power Metal album and a hard rock album. The second album leans more towards Power Metal, and is also more diverse. I dig both, but you might find yourself favoring one of the two.  

We're at the end of another of my walls of text. As I mentioned, **Avantasia** is next. Look forward to it! I might actually have to split it up in two parts because of the size of the discography and the awesomeness of the band (making me write more).

"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","I have been enjoying Neonfly as well, and I am glad to see these opinions.  Heart of the Sun was my song of 2014."
"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","Always good to see another Neonfly enthusiast. I probably listen to Heart of the Sun 5x a day nowadays... its *that good*"
"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","I wasn't expecting to find Neonfly here! I first saw them years ago back when they had their previous singer. They played the Bloodstock festival not long after that, but the singer couldn't make it so they brought in Norton as a temporary replacement. He was *so* much better that we all begged them to keep him on permanently. Fortunately, they did.

&gt; I couldn't find an isolated track that is a must-listen.

That track is ""Ship with no sails"", but only really in a live setting. Like the rest of the debut album, if felt a bit flat in the studio.

The second album is much, *much* better."
"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","Hah, so sad for the original singer! But I'm glad for it, Norton is amazing.

Ship with no Sails is definitely good, though. But so is basically the whole album... couldn't pick one that stood out high above the others.

In terms of production value, the second album is better indeed. I'd probably lean towards that one as well, but the first one is awesome as well."
"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","&gt; Hah, so sad for the original singer! But I'm glad for it, Norton is amazing.

Yes. Vocally the previous singer, Tamás Csemez, [was actually quite reasonable](https://soundcloud.com/tamas-csemez/the-sign-of-the-southern-cross), although he lacked stage presence. It's just that Norton is better on pretty much every level."
"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","My good friend Andy Midgely (ex-Power Quest, has played with I AM I) just became their official guitarist. Great band, amazing energy on-stage, seriously has great potential. "
"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","I always shrugged at Neonfly, Heart of the sun is a good song though.

Just a note: Highways to Nowhere isn't really a punk rock song, it goes more into alternative metal territory ala Disturbed mixed with Neonfly's power metal style."
"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","I don't know if you're into hard rock, but if not, I can definitely understand the lack of appeal.

As for Highways to Nowhere, I found it a little hard to place. Thanks for pointing that out "
"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","Quite frankly I always felt hard rock to be a bit too samey, i definitely like some of it but most of hard rock songs are just either to similar to others or too simplistic. [Audrey Horne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YYCjR2dgsc), is an example of what I would call a good hard rock band and song.

Neonfly is definitely a good band but ultimately I just get that familiar sensation or repetition, even if they're 100% original songs. They do have good melodies though."
"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","Great writeup and great band! "
"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","Thank you for the kind words!"
"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","Had the pleasure of seeing &amp; photographing these guys supporting Dragonforce in the UK. Absolutely amazing on stage and so down to earth off it."
"Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly","Have to disagree. ""Fierce Battalions"" isn't a decent track. It's goddamn glorious. ""Take me to the place where the fires are burning"" is metal."
"Steelwing - Tokkotai (Wind of Fury)",""
"Steelwing - Tokkotai (Wind of Fury)","Probably my favorite band that came in this century. I really missed good old heavy until this new wave of bands came about, and I consider Steelwing to be the best of the lot. And Riley is one of my favorite singers ever. Their third album should be coming sometime this year, I can't wait. "
"Steelwing - Tokkotai (Wind of Fury)","Have you tried US Power metal?"
"Steelwing - Tokkotai (Wind of Fury)","I have. Virgin Steele and Crimson Glory are among my favorite bands, but I think Steelwing sound closer to 80's Maiden than any USPM band I know of. "
"Steelwing - Tokkotai (Wind of Fury)","Oh my god, this is awesome."
"Savatage reunion...question about Vocalist","So Savatage is playing a reunion show in Wacken.
Now my question about this is the following.

If  Zachary Stevens does not sing in Wacken, would you still call this a reunion?

Reason I am asking is, that the he sang on (IMO) four of last albums and he was the front-man during the height of their career.
Disclaimer:
I am skipping Poets and Madman as that album came out as a half ass try and clearly deserved more effort.
And I have not seen any confirmation that Zach will be at Wacken with Savatage.
"
"Savatage reunion...question about Vocalist","Jon Oliva is THE savatage singer, end of discussion. "
"Savatage reunion...question about Vocalist","Amen"
"Savatage reunion...question about Vocalist","But the majority of their better albums does not John as singer.

And I love John but his voice has lost some of it's magic over the last couple of years.

So I would hope that Zach sings in Wacken, although what do I care. I don't have a ticket anyways :("
"Savatage reunion...question about Vocalist","Jon sang on seven albums, Zak sang on five. Jon -almost- sang on Handful of Rain, considering he wrote and played the entire damn thing. I prefer Zak over Jon, but there is no arguing that Jon is usually the preferred vocalist."
"Savatage reunion...question about Vocalist","Their best albums are Hall of the mountain King through Edge of Thorns. "
"Savatage reunion...question about Vocalist","I am pretty sure I read somewhere that Zak would be there.

For me, it's important he be there. For the past few years, Jon Oliva and Zak have been doing Savatage tributes with their own bands. For it to be a Savatage reunion in name, it should have the majority of the band's important players. 

Edge of Thorns should definitely be included in the classic Savatage releases along with Hall of the Mountain King, Gutter Ballet, and Streets. I also enjoy the next three Savatage albums with Zak just as much as well.

Also, I will be at this show, so I'm really hoping Zak is there and they have a good mix of songs from both eras!"
"Savatage reunion...question about Vocalist","I hate you for being at the show,;)

But I so agree with you that he was the voice on the majority of the band's important albums.

I so hope that they will throw in some shows in NA preferably Canada so that I can see them one more time.
"
"Savatage reunion...question about Vocalist","You are the only person alive who doesn't consider hall of the mountain king and gutter ballet their important albums. 

Feel free to like the later era more, but don't call it the important era. "
"Savatage reunion...question about Vocalist","Please see how I mentioned majority, and I have to admit I came to Savatage with the Streets album, so although I know that HotMK and GB are milestones, I never really payed as much attention to them as I probably should."

"Sonata Arctica - The Caleb Saga [Caleb, The End Of This Chapter, Don't Say A Word, Juliet]",""
"Sonata Arctica - The Caleb Saga [Caleb, The End Of This Chapter, Don't Say A Word, Juliet]","Don't Say a Word is one of the most beautiful (though actually pretty disturbing) songs to have ever graced my ears. "
"Sonata Arctica - The Caleb Saga [Caleb, The End Of This Chapter, Don't Say A Word, Juliet]","The refrain is an explosive masterpiece."
"Sonata Arctica - The Caleb Saga [Caleb, The End Of This Chapter, Don't Say A Word, Juliet]","So what exactly is the right order to listen to these songs in order to fully hear the story? "
"Sonata Arctica - The Caleb Saga [Caleb, The End Of This Chapter, Don't Say A Word, Juliet]","The order the playlist is in. 

**Caleb** - the ""prequel""; Caleb's upbringing

**The End Of This Chapter** - Caleb stalks a girl

**Don't Say A Word** - Caleb catches the girl

**Juliet** - Caleb dies - (how/why up to interpretation...)

That's the basic gist, hope it helps you start to make sense of the story!"
"Sonata Arctica - The Caleb Saga [Caleb, The End Of This Chapter, Don't Say A Word, Juliet]","Woah this is very interesting! Thanks for submitting this!

I really think End of This chapter is such a powerful song. Even though the topic of stalking is not something a lot can relate to, the feeling the 'stalker' feels makes you have so much empathy. You can feel the pain and the suffering the stalker feels. Very interesting and very bold to make a song about this. 

For the rest of the songs, I think with your explanation on the subject I think I should take more time to read and understand the lyrics. "

**SinuataBouquet's Recommendation of the Week**

I had a hard time finding preview tracks for most of the releases this week, so I've included some old material just for you to get a feeling of what the band has made earlier.

Well, I've got a thing for The Unguided, but the short preview makes it hard to get a good overview.
If you can handle harsh vocals (I know some of you really don't like it), I'd give **Incursed** a shot. It's a spanish band making death-influenced folk metal, reminding me of Ensiferum. They've got some good melodies going on.

[Lots of good ""year in review"" posts last week! Keep 'em coming!](http://i.imgur.com/C4rJB94.gif)
"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/22 - 12/28)","Looks like it's up to me to step up to the plate. Besides, there's two releases this week I already know I'll be listening to (they're both EP's though), so I might as well do this write-up again.

My opinions (based upon previews only):

* **Havenless:** Very meh. It's a decent length ""teaser"", so it's more than adequate for previewing the new album, but there's honestly not much going on worth noting. It's like a melodic death metal album with the speed turned down and the production quality turned down too. There's not much too say here, because I know most power metal fans won't be interested by this, and even death metal fans will get bored by this like I am.

* **The Unguided:** Recommended for fans of Sonic Syndicate, Disarmonia Mundi, Mutiny Within, and Blood Stain Child. This teaser is entirely way too short for me to get an iota of how good any of the songs are, but my guess is that it won't be too far removed from what *Fragile Immortality* sounded like from this year. Here's their video for ""[Inception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brLwlB8j0JQ)""; check it out. The album was pretty decent, if a little repetitive. I'm gonna guess that this new EP will be similar.

* **Incursed:** I've already listened to this album in full, and it's quite good. The Ensiferum comparison is definitely warranted, as would a Wintersun comparison. It's a fun album with some decent melodies leading the songs, but I just wish it was faster. I feel like that's my complaint about half the albums I end up hearing. Anyways, this track that is linked is one of the best tracks from the album, and you'll notice clean vocals during the chorus. They sound a lot better than they did when Wintersun tried them on the self-titled album. This is a bit more obscure, but if any of you checked out the Heidra album for earlier this year, this is pretty much the exact same thing, and I mean that in a good way. 

* **MinstreliX:** The track that's linked in the OP is from their 2014 album, *Chronostrings*, which is as close as you're ever gonna get to a Galneryus clone. They're pretty good at what they do, but the album tended to blend together. This new EP is a rerecording from some of their very early material (and one new song). [Here's a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZx7BHbZELI) to one of those old songs that's being rerecorded. I don't know if they're rearranging or adding in anything new to the songs, but the originals are all pretty great neoclassical power metal tracks. However, they had a pretty bad production and an even worse female singer at the time, so this could be a huge improvement for MinstreliX. So definitely check this out if you like Galneryus or Jupiter.

* **Mistweaver:** This isn't half bad. It'll be too heavy for about 50% of this subreddit, but it does feature an operatic female singer backing up the lead vocalist, and some of the passages are superb (especially the one at 2:05). So here's a link to ""[Hell's Arrival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNaaJUlbyZQ)"". It seems like I may have to give this one a listen. This second song is much more of a death metal song, but it seems very well done. I'm not sure what to compare this one to...maybe a more melodic Emperor? In any case, this is recommended for you death metal listeners.

* **Krusher:** It's a Polish band, but the vocals are quite decent. It reminds me a bit of Crystal Viper. The video is quite *out there*, but the song is straight out of the '80s. With that said, it's also really derivative and bland. There's no real identity to the song. It's as if they took *every single* band from the 1980s, removed the really good and really bad elements, and then made a song from that. I don't think anyone's gonna have to check this band out.

* **My Darkest Fury:** That opening riff gave me high hopes. So I sought out the full version of ""[A Road to Nowhere](http://satanath.bandcamp.com/track/a-road-to-nowhere)"". Unfortunately, I'm not getting much out of this. The harsh vocals could be a lot better, and the instrumentation just seems to be boring whenever they're not soloing. Much like the Krusher preview, I don't see a real need for anyone to listen to this.

What I missed last week:

* **Xiphea:** This is a decent way to end the week. It's pretty much a carbon copy of Diabulus in Musica or a less-power metal version of Epica, but that female singer is just a tier below Zuberoa Aznárez and Simone Simons. The grunts are superb, though, so depending on your feelings on female-fronted symphonic metal, this may or may not be worth checking out. This isn't even a new track that I'm listening to, and it doesn't sound too bad. I have to hope that the new album is superior to this old track.

And that's it for this week. Next week should be interesting, mostly because no one in their right mind would release something right before the end of the year. Hopefully, we'll get some musicians who are out of their right minds. "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/22 - 12/28)","Well guys, guess which piece of shit is back from his holiday? Also, guess which piece of shit forgot his music, and has been stuck with early 30s &amp; 40s music and Pitbull remixes. This week is going to be full of ""Oh this was great!"", I can tell already.

That's right, get ready, because the master of poor taste and uselessly pretentious breakdowns of great music has risen once again to terrorise the Weekly threads!

My Opinions (based on previews only):

- **Havenless:** I'm really digging the guitar riffs these guys play; it's slower than you would want from a PM band, but has a lot of multi-layered complexity that adds a whole lot to their music. The vocals are pretty decent, the harshness they bring meshes very well with the instruments. Overall, pretty damn good.

- **Incursed:** This started out sounding less like Dirty Vocals Folk Metal and more like Dirty Vocals in a Power Metal song. Then comes in the accordion or whatever and changed my mind; ""Nope, definitely Dirty Folk"". And then came the clean vocals. Jesus guys, make up your mind, are you glorious Dirty Folk Metal, or glorious Dirty Power Metal, I can't handle *both* in the one song. This was fucking amazing - harsh, fast, groovy; it had everything you should want from both Power Metal AND Folk Metal in the same goddamn song. The vocals were awesome, and the instruments were amazing. I don't know what to say, I loved it.

- **Minstrelix:** Hey /u/SinuataBouquet, is the ""Old Track"" classifier there to say that it's from an old album and they are redoing it or re-releasing it or something? Whatever, I like it. The instrumentation is pretty much the best thing ever, metalising classical music is always brilliant. I love the shit out of the shred. The vocals I think could mesh a little better with the instrumentation at times, but for the most part are fucking great. Overall, I really like the guitar on this one. Oh and the rest of it too I guess.

- **Mistweaver:** Once again, a song with Operatic vocals that I like them in. Might be the death growls that accompany them helping them out though. The instrumentation is decent, it's fast and heavy, but changes completely seemingly at random, making the song tough to follow, and really makes it hard to enjoy the song. The vocals are decent, both the Dirty Vocals and the Operatic Vocals are used as background instruments for the most part, rather than take the forefront in the song. This really helps to allow them to mesh together well, and both sets of vocals complements the other well, the Dirty vocals break up the slowness of the Operatic, while the Operatic Vocals break up the harshness of the Dirty. Overall, I probably won't listen to it again after this (except to complete my top 20 previews of the year list, even though it most likely won't be there), it was decent, but to aimless and unfocused for me to enjoy.

- **Krusher:** This was pretty good. The instrumentation was exactly what you expect from Heavy Metal, and the vocals were pretty good. I don't really know what to say about these guys; I liked it, but I can't break it down as to why.

- **My Darkest Fury:** This had some decent stuff, some super shit stuff. Honestly, twenty second previews aren't really enough enough to comment on. At least Havenless gave us like a minute or so to listen to the song to determine whether we liked it.

And what I missed (I'll get to the other two weeks later):

- **Xiphea:** You totally missed out this week /u/Fazermint. Just kidding. She sings *so fucking high*. Holy fuck that's agonising. I constantly shit on people who do that in JPower, and it is not going to be different here. It doesn't matter what the instrumentation did, and the dirty vocals aren't going to save it, the clean vocals are so high that they completely at odds to the music."

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/22 - 12/28)","You know what? I'll skip this week :P (and the crowd cheered)"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/22 - 12/28)","Aargh, why couldn't Incursed have clean vocals!

*Raises fist to the sky, cursing Odin*"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/22 - 12/28)","The chorus does have clean vocals."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/22 - 12/28)","Not a lot of power metal in this week's power metal releases. Tough week to put a list together, I bet."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/22 - 12/28)","Welp, nothing interesting for me this week as well. If the next one's not any better, it looks like the year's wrapped up for me."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (12/22 - 12/28)","1 power metal track....from an ep......from a band that it's impossible to find their stuff(anything involving Leo Figaro is hard to find) AND a Metalcore track? What subreddit am I in?"
"The Blackened - The Eagle",""
"The Blackened - The Eagle","This is a collaboration between different musicians from the UK, the US, and Estonia. I did the vocals/lyrics. It was a lot of fun and we're looking forward to collaborating again. Hope you guys like it and please send feedback."
"The Blackened - The Eagle","You asked for feedback, here it is.  
  
1. Intro. The opening riff is very power slave-y. Muted and... compartmentalized I guess. There's nothing wrong with that sound, but I would personally prefer some more sound than the very short silent spots with only the somewhat shallow drums filling the void. **Don't get me wrong**, the riff is good and probably works for a lot of people, but I think it's kind of bare.  
  
2. Verse. I really like the riff. Some more exploration of harmonics *might* help flesh it out to make more catchy. Your voice is very well suited to power. It has the quite rare quality of being powerful and high without sounding forced. With more work and some editing I could see it being very recognizable and incredibly strong.  
  
3. Chorus. I like the lyrical theme, and the whole segments seems to flow naturally from the bridge. It's actually catchy in its own right, and with higher production quality I could easily see myself humming this.  
  
4. Conclusion. Right now, it sounds like a very formulaic power demo. **And that's good**. For improvement I'd suggest amping up the bass, since I like the underlying line but I have to actively listen to hear it. Also - work on exploring guitar harmonics and edit your singing a bit. I'm not saying your voice is bad, in fact - it's GOOD; but for this to be a better song, you need to make it a bit cleaner and more full.  
  
**TL;DR**  
Good stuff. Keep it up \m/"
"The Blackened - The Eagle","Thanks for the feedback! I only wrote the vocals, so I appreciate your ideas regarding tone and delivery."
"The Blackened - The Eagle","Vocals are interesting, but production and mastering is poor. But still, it's pretty good"
"Heavenly - Farewell",""
"Heavenly - Farewell","I'm still convinced that the main reason people like this album is the cover art... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
"Heavenly - Farewell","gee, I wonder what makes you say that..."
"Heavenly - Farewell","Is Heavenly EVER going to make a new album?"
"What do you think about ""Jorn Lande &amp; Trond Holter present Dracula - Swing Of Death""",""
"What do you think about ""Jorn Lande &amp; Trond Holter present Dracula - Swing Of Death""","So far, it's taken up my 2nd place for AOTY. Absolutely love the album 10/10"
"What do you think about ""Jorn Lande &amp; Trond Holter present Dracula - Swing Of Death""","I can't agree with Fazermint words. Maybe it's not that much heavy, but it's great. I totally love Jorn voice and i think that if you liked ""Walking on Water"" you'll propably like the rest of this album. Can't decide which song is the best, because every song on this album is unique and different. But there's no boring songs here. And even that i'm not a huge fan of female vocals in metal, This female vocalist we have here's pretty decent. Trond Holter is doing pretty good work on guitar, drums are working well. And since i'm a big fan of Castlevania series i really liked lyrics and general Dracula theme.

tl;dr 8/10"
"What do you think about ""Jorn Lande &amp; Trond Holter present Dracula - Swing Of Death""","It's definitely a weak release when compared to Jorn's own solo albums, I'd say. It's hard rock, so it's less heavy than you'd like for an album featuring Jorn. Some songs have a clear touch of classical music, and these are usually duets with an unknown female vocalist (she's not *unknown* but I have never heard of her). It's by far the ""softest"" release Jorn has ever put out. It's enjoyable in its own right, but I'd much rather just listen to one of Jorn's solo albums."
"What do you think about ""Jorn Lande &amp; Trond Holter present Dracula - Swing Of Death""","I fully expected this to be a train wreck, I'm surprised and disappointed to say this is not the pile of shit I though it was going to be, It's surprisingly good but a bore-fest nonetheless. The big ace up their sleeves are the always great vocals by Jorn; Guitars done by Trond are not the low point of the album and the man is definitely talented. However, everything feels a bit too forced, the whole theatrical aspect and symphonic stuff seems out of place and draws inspirations from stuff like Epica, Savatage and the sorts. The lyrics seem very weak, I expected more since it was a rock opera.

Big fucking plus, no shitty narration like in most rock operas, this albums sports individual songs that link themselves to the greater narrative. The better song on the album is Walking On Water and even that one is kind of boring. So If you don't like Walking On Water, this album is not for you.

**TLDR: 5/10**"
"What do you think about ""Jorn Lande &amp; Trond Holter present Dracula - Swing Of Death""","Great album, really enjoying it. Probably my favourite thing Jorn has done since Aeronautics."

He does this every year at Thanksgiving. He listens to obtuse amounts of music and has similar tastes to me. Just when I think I've got my top 10 sorted for the year, I look at his list and find about 7 other strong contenders that I missed. Enjoy!"
"ProgPower USA founder posts his top 50 for the year.","Any list without Noble Beast is incorrect. "

"ProgPower USA founder posts his top 50 for the year.","What are your favorite songs off of Noble Beast and why?"
"ProgPower USA founder posts his top 50 for the year.","There isn't a bad song on the entire album.  If I had to choose a favorite it would be either Nothing to Repent, Ironclad Angels or We Burn."
"ProgPower USA founder posts his top 50 for the year.","Good disc, but not top 10 for me either."

"ProgPower USA founder posts his top 50 for the year.","Dynazty is alright.  Not really my thing. Falconer is a solid album, I don't have really any complaints about it, but I can't see taking out any of my current top 10 for it.  

Sabaton....Sabaton is closer to my 10 worst albums of the year. Its just completely unspectacular.  "
"ProgPower USA founder posts his top 50 for the year.","I have never been big on Sabaton.  Especially their early albums, and their latest album.  However, Night Witches I think is one of the most spectacular Sabaton songs and the only stand-out track on that album.  Do you really think Night Witches is poor too?"
"ProgPower USA founder posts his top 50 for the year.","It's a 10-track album, there's like 2/3 good songs on the album the rest is filler. Night Witches is definitely awesome but won't salvage the album."

"ProgPower USA founder posts his top 50 for the year.","I may have heard of 3 or so albums on that list. "
"ProgPower USA founder posts his top 50 for the year.","I would put Delain higher, however. The new album was a big step up for them. ^^^yet ^^^they ^^^don't ^^^play ^^^it ^^^live"
"ProgPower USA founder posts his top 50 for the year.","Hymns for the Broken is my number 1 for the year too, Evergrey sadly doesn't seem to get much love. Lately I have been pretty exclusively listening to them and I just can't seem to get enough."
"Any suggestions for some Christmas/Yule/holiday themed power metal?","I'm making a Christmas metal playlist, and I've already asked over in /r/folkmetal. So I figured I would ask here as well. "
"Any suggestions for some Christmas/Yule/holiday themed power metal?","Yes.

[Trans Siberian Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O9CN5F_g_I)

Yeah it's a metal/rock opera more than power metal, get over it. This is THE christmas album (along with their other christmas albums) if you are looking for christmas metal, I doubt any people have done it much better than these guys.

If you want a track by them specifically, not the full album, try [A Mad Russian's Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19wFiRt6u-U)

Also apparently the Christian power metal band Theocracy has released one Christmas track per year since 2003. (Hey, these are actually pretty good! I mean the lyrics in [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jwHLsKsiCA) are hilarious) Playlist:

LOL
"
"Any suggestions for some Christmas/Yule/holiday themed power metal?","Trans Siberian Orchestra is my go-to Christmas music as well, even if it's not precisely power metal. It's tons of fun to listen to, and has the right spirit. ""The Christmas Attic"" is my favorite of the older albums."
"Any suggestions for some Christmas/Yule/holiday themed power metal?","For sure, TSO's got everything how it should be.

But seriously. I've listened to that Theocracy song ([Wynter Fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jwHLsKsiCA)) like 10 times now, it sounds great and the lyrics are hilarious (looks like it's their own original christmas story, pretty great stuff!). If you are looking for christmas power metal specifically, this is probably the best set of covers for that goal.

EDIT: The other ones are also pretty funny. These theocracy songs are great."

"Sonata Arctica - The Vice","I remember first hearing this song and it became an immediate favorite. It was so different than anything Sonata Arctica had done up until that point and is definitely a highlight on what I think is still their best album.

Now I'm going to binge on *Unia* all day."
"Sonata Arctica - The Vice","You should be binging on Ravenhead!  Granted, It doesn't come close to To The End, but its solid so far.  "
"Sonata Arctica - The Vice","The forgotten album. Tracks 7-9 are my favorite. The vice - my dream's but a drop of fuel for a nightmare - the harvest. "
"Sonata Arctica - The Vice","A misunderstood album for sure. Takes a few listens to get into.

This song though, caught my attention right off the get go."
"Sonata Arctica - The Vice","Funnily enough I just listened to that album. Somehow weird but it's good and this is one of the best songs on the album in my opinion."
"Sonata Arctica - The Vice","I was confused by this album when it came out and I was like 14. Now I love it."
"What do you think about ""Winterage - The Harmonic Passage""",""
"What do you think about ""Winterage - The Harmonic Passage""","I have so much time on my hands let's be produtive and avoid the usage of punctuation to convey biased opinions on a fresh form of art GO (exclamation point)

13 fucking songs, 70 minutes. I'm writing this sentence before even listening to the album and I would bet all of my man marbles (the whole two of them) that it's too fucking long. Probably another case of Metallica-itis.

**Ouverture in do minore** - Whoever delivers the violins definitely did a good job but that's about it, it's very one dimensional and bland and some instruments just seem out of key even if it appears intentional, it's almost as if they're tuning the instruments (If that's the purpose of the intro, I clap). In the end, it serves no purpose other than to check the list of symphonic power metal rules. Also, ""Ouverture""? Does this have any meaning or is it really a typo.

**The Harmonic Passage** - The true album opener and a very good song at that, possibly because it resembles Rhapsody of Fire so much but hey, it works. This song is a bit too long, a lot of doodlery and diddlery in the middle that could have been cut.

**The Flame Shall Not Fade** - Text-book slower song following fast song. It's not that bad, It's okay. the parts towards the end are pretty good.

**Wirewings** - Boy can this guy hit some fucking high notes. Good fun song but the vocalist abuses a little bit too much and attempts to shatter the windows in my house. It's important to note that I haven't heard any significant guitar work other than some average solos, everything is being delivered by the symphonic instruments. I'm starting to think that they actually aimed for a fully violin driven album.

**Son of Winter** - Obligatory ballad. Not a bad one, it does get more interesting towards the end, almost as if they are breaking the monotony that is the first half of the song. The female vocals are superb.

**La caccia di Tùrin** - Interludery.

**Golden Worm** - What a start! Even if the guitar sounds a little bit like the intro in the second song. This song is kinda of awesome in all aspects, all instruments contribute and elevate the song into a feast for the senses, different vocal tonality enhances the song even further. Six minutes of excellent symphonic power metal. Again, the guitar remains secondary to others (only shines in the beginning of the song) but I'm starting to feel that it doesn't harm the album at all.

**Victory March** - This one is a bummer, it's an instrumental bit but just seems to fall flat, I expected to feel really pumped and ready to conquer the world but it just doesn't do it for me. The album would be better without this one.

**La grotta di cristallo** - [Folkloric tune for the festivities](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/79/5d/42/795d42772ad7615162f4e60f7bd92b77.jpg)! Similar to the Rhapsody style but more folky and melodic and more metal in a sense. Rhapsody folk style could go all the way to the true nature of folkloric music, this one is metal sprinkled with folk elements. The song could be smaller as well.

**Crown to the Crowds** - Energetic song. Rarely does it slow down, and it keeps driving forward delivering more and more. The tiny trumpet intro is quite fitting.

**Panserbjørne** - This one has the guitar in focus which is something I was not expecting in the rest of the album. A very welcome change of pace. this one is similar to Golden Worm in variety, just a plethora of different instruments and this time with the occasional rough vocals. this one is also slower and held back but great nonetheless. the main vocalist can hit some crazy high notes but thankfully he only does it very occasionally and doesn't force it on the listener constantly (*cough* *cough* Pellek).

**The Endless Well** - Bad slow intro, it does not set the mood for anything. This one gives me a sense of Déjà vu on some melodies and it's all a bit of a mess and awkward. Some parts are really cool but some other parts are just plain weird. this should not be fucking 5 minutes. It's basically a giant prelude for the final song. The last 45 seconds are pretty good.

**Awakening** - This one is a sad ending to the album. I refuse to believe they meshed this shit together and thought it was a good idea. Yeah let's make a bunch of different melodies and segments, select some classical pieces and bundle everything together in a non-cohesive manner. Okay I get what you are going for, you want to make a diverse uniquely structured song with elements from different classical symphonies, concertos and sonatas, it's a cool idea and can wield excellent pieces of music but this is not the way to do it. This is just an incoherent mess of melodies, bridges and pretentious wankery that has no build-up and no sense of direction; which is stupid because they have proven in this very album, that they can write complex songs (listen to Golden Worm and Panserbjorne). Truly, one of the worst endings to an album I have heard in recent times.

All in all, pretty good stuff going on here aside the finale, the violin is such a relevant part of the album and it's done very tastefully, it definitely stands out as the mvp of the album. Everything else is pretty good, there aren't weak elements other than the [fucking bass](http://www.westcoastcouples.com/Largemouth_bass-600%20reverse.jpg) (might as well not even be there). The vocals are all very well done and add a very refreshing variety to the whole album. Anyone interested in symphonic power metal should give this a serious shot, I know I will be listening to it again even if the final song seriously annoys me.

This band has some serious potential."
"What do you think about ""Winterage - The Harmonic Passage""","I've only heard the one song posted. Reminded me of old school Rhapsody in a way.  Its rough around the edges, which I like, but it also seems to have potential. I'll have to check out the rest of it."
"What do you think about ""Winterage - The Harmonic Passage""","Same here. If the title track is any indication of the rest of the album, we're in for a  treat. Those high-pitched screams were slightly out of place, but I can live with it."
"What do you think about ""Winterage - The Harmonic Passage""","My post didn't make much of a splash but some saw some potential in it, as did I. I look forward to digesting the full release."

"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","All of Symphony X is extremely talented. Not a weak band member in there."
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","Pretty sure it'd be impossible to be a weak band member when all the music *requires* such technical proficiency.  

"
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","Well, the thing is, they would downplay a weak band member when writing tracks then and have less prominent stuff for them. That's what usually happens. Due to their band being kick-ass they can write such technical stuff and the members are completely okay with that."
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","Yeah I know :) Such a great band.  "
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","Yep, the dude is definitely fucking amazing, I admire how consistent he is, very few singers can sing like this and maintain the same quality over the years."
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","I love this guy. His voice is one of the few that can move me to tears (ask the guys from Viathyn that frequent this sub, we were all sobbing manly tears during the last 70K cruise during *Paradise Lost*).

I was at a show in Los Angeles a few years back and his old voice teacher was there (towards the end of *The Odyssey* they stopped the song and he pointed him out. Guy was quite old and in a wheelchair and it was an AMAZING moment, going to see if anyone got it on video). He said that Michael Romeo is tough on him, but his vocal coach was the person that made him who he is today - that he continually pushed him and he basically owes everything to him.

I just really want to meet his old voice teacher. That man worked some miracles."
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","God dammit shit cock sucker fuck!!!

I thought that was some bullshit when they said Russell was touring with TSO(East) this year! HE DIDN'T PLAY IN ATLANTA!

I even brought my Paradise Lost vinyl to get signed ;_;

"
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","The way they split up their tours is very strange, they have an east coast and west coast band with completely different lineups. Russell only does the east coast run, which apparently doesn't include Atlanta? I had to go to Indiana last year to see Russell with TSO because for some reason Chicago is part of the west coast tour.

Got free tickets to the TSO show in Salt Lake City this year with Jeff Scott Soto and all of the vocalists paled in comparison to Russell."
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","No, they played in Atlanta, but Russell didn't play that day. :(

We even had front row this year by some miracle. I was so pumped to see Russell up close. Fourth (?) song on the set, lights are dark, I see the curly mane and beard! IT'S GOTTA BE RUSSELL! Lights turn on.... aaaaaaannnnd it's the blonde British dude...

The disappointment was so real..."
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","Nathan James? Yeah, he was on the west coast tour. I'm assuming you got the west coast lineup. Who was the lead guitarist/band leader? Was it Al Pitrelli or Chris Caffrey?"
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","Chris! I just don't get it ;_;"
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","Wow...that IS really weird! Maybe he had to take some days off to record vocals for the Symphony X album!"
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","\&gt;or Romanov"
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","Russell is hands down the best singer in all of heavy music. I wish more people knew of his brilliance. In my opinion, he's every bit as good (or better) than metal gods like Dickinson, Dio, and Halford. "
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","whoa there, have you forgotten about our lord and savior Hansi?"
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","Hansi vs. Russell...FIGHT!"

"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","[The quality is pretty meh on this but it also shows how amazing he is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8ooO6sSwrY)"
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","He probably got good advice on how to growl his voice without killing it. Growling is potentially dangerous"
"Russell Allen is fucking amazing","I actually hadn't heard of him before, sounds great for sure.

Khan is god."

"The song that got me into Blind Guardian(yes i was 13 and hardly knew anything about power metal forgive me)","We see things differently - I think that subreddits like these should be used to discover *new* bands, instead of just upvoting classics.

"My favorite PM albums from each year.","So doing the year end best of’s got me in the mood for lists and I finally finished up something I started earlier in the year when it became apparent that all I had left in life was arguing about power metal with strangers over the internet.  Anyway, I wanted to do my top three power metal albums from each year. I’m sure no one really cares, but this took more time than I care to admit, so I’m going to share it anyway. 

I decided to start in 1983, because there wasn't much going on before then in terms of power metal.  Also, this list seems to be constantly changing, so if you feel like i've left something out, let me know. There is a good chance i've forgotten some proper albums. 

**1983**- No Competition here, Crystal Logic runs away with it. 

Manilla Road- Crystal Logic

Savatage- Sirens

Manowar- Into Glory Ride

__________________________________________________________

**1984** - Metal Church gets 1984 by the narrowest of margins.  How the hell is someone expected to choose between Metal Church and Ample Destruction though.

Metal Church- S/t

Jag Panzer- Ample Destruction

Omen- Battle Cry

__________________________________________________________

**1985**- I'll probably lose some credibility for picking two albums ahead of A Spectre Within, but my heart is telling me Open the Gates here. 

Manilla Road- Open the Gates

Helloween- Walls of Jericho

Fates Warning- The Spectre Within

__________________________________________________________

**1986**- Any of these albums could have been number 1, but Graceful Inheritance is just an absurdly good album.  

Heir Apparent- Graceful Inheritance

Flotsam &amp; Jetsam- Doomsday for the Deceiver

Manilla Road- The Deluge

__________________________________________________________

**1987**- This year should probably be a tie, but Keeper gets the nod simply for having a bigger impact on my metalhead development.

Helloween- Keeper of the Seven Keys I

Savatage- Hall of the Mountain King

Manilla Road- Mystification

__________________________________________________________

**1988**- Thanks to a certain member here i've had the pleasure of falling head over heals for Master Control this year.  I'm embarrassed an album this good has slipped under my radar for so long.

Liege Lord- Master Control

Helloween- Keeper of the Seven Keys II

Riot- Thundersteel

__________________________________________________________

**1989**- Poor Running Wild, releasing what is easily their best album the same year that Savatage released one of the greatest metal albums ever. 

Savatage- Gutter Ballet

Running Wild- Death or Glory

Cloven Hoof- A Sultan’s Ransom

__________________________________________________________

**1990**- Sadly overshadowed by the mighty Thundersteel, Privilege of Power is a powerhouse in its own right and the brass sections are such an enjoyable addition.

Riot- The Privilege of Power

Manilla Road- The Courts of Chaos

Blind Guardian- Tales from the Twilight World

__________________________________________________________

**1991** - Talk about lightning in a bottle.  Night of the Stormrider is the only IE album that has ever made me take notice. Also, Greely&gt;Barlow any day of the week. 

Iced Earth- Night of the Stormrider

Savatage- Streets: A Rock Opera

Running Wild- Blazon Stone

__________________________________________________________

**1992**- The first ""Real"" BG album. Somewhere Far Beyond is the album that set them apart from their contemporaries. 

Blind Guardian- Somewhere Far Beyond

Running Wild- Pile of Skulls

Stratovarius- Twilight Time

__________________________________________________________

**1993**- Even with the painful vocals of Andre Matos, its really hard to argue against Angra's debut.  

Angra- Angels Cry

Savatage- Edge of Thorns

Conception- Parallel Minds

__________________________________________________________

**1994**- Running Wild continues to be unable to get a break and finds themselves up against another truly phenomenal album. 

Virgin Steele- The Marriage of Heaven and Hell I

Running Wild- Black Hand In

Fates Warning- Inside Out

__________________________________________________________

**1995**- For me, Land of the Free is an easy choice here.  

Gamma Ray- Land of the Free

Blind Guardian- Imaginations from the Other Side

Virgin Steele- The Marriage of Heaven and Hell II

__________________________________________________________

**1996**- Stratovarius' best album is an easy pick here.  Holy Land is a beast of an album, but Episode is special.

Stratovarius- Episode

Angra- Holy Land

Heaven’s Gate- Planet E.

__________________________________________________________

**1997**- Kai Hansen, at his best, was pretty much untouchable.  This isn't Gamma Ray's best, but its still enough to get top album fo me.

Gamma Ray- Somewhere Out in Space

Symphony X- The Divine Wings of Tragedy

Rhapsody- Legendary Tales

__________________________________________________________

**1998**- Obviously

Blind Guardian- Nightfall in Middle Earth

Nightwish- Oceanborn

Slaughter Xstroyes- Free the Beast

__________________________________________________________

**1999**- Ecliptica just isn't enough to beat out Edguy's second best album.  It was close though. 

Edguy- Theater of Salvation

Sonata Arctica- Ecliptica

Freedom Call- Stairway to Fairyland

__________________________________________________________

**2000**- I don't know if a rerecording counts, but this is my favorite Edguy album, so i'm giving it the win.

Edguy- The Savage Poetry

Rhapsody- Dawn of Victory

Symphony X- V:The Mythology Suite

__________________________________________________________

**2001**- The Masterful return of Manilla Road and Angra's best still aren't enough to compete with the otherwordliness(?) of Lost Horizon.

Lost Horizon- Awakening the World

Angra- Rebirth

Manilla Road- Atlantis Rising

__________________________________________________________

**2002**- No competition. Pagan's Mind Steamrolled everyone in 02.

Pagan’s Mind- Celestial Entrance

Avantasia- The Metal Opera II

Luca Turilli- Prophet of the Last Eclipse

__________________________________________________________

**2003**- One of the best years in power metal, and its not even close who the winner is.  It just isn't fair to other bands. 

Lost Horizon- A Flame to the Ground Beneath

Twilightning- Delerium Veil

Kamelot- Epica

__________________________________________________________


**2004**- Hibria took the metal world by storm in 04.  Again, not even close here.

Dragonland- Astronomy

Kiuas- Reformation

Pharaoh- The Longest Night

__________________________________________________________

**2007**- Helloween returning to greatness with arguably their best album.  

Helloween- Gambling With the Devil

Aquaria- Shambala

Sonata Arctica- Unia

__________________________________________________________

**2008**- 08 was a pretty weak year overall, so Keldian were pretty much a shoe in.

Keldian- Journey of Souls

Serenity- Fallen Sanctuary

Sabaton- The Art of War

__________________________________________________________

**2009**- Fairyland taking 09 with one of the best symphonic power metal albums i've ever heard. 

Fairyland- A Score to A New Beginning

DGM- Frame

Heavenly- Carpe Diem

__________________________________________________________

**2010**- BTSBTT gave me feelings I haven't felt since Lost Horizon. This album is absurd in every aspect, yet it somehow works.

Pathfinder- Beyond the Space Beyond the Time

Blind Guardian- At the Edge of Time

Triosphere- The Road Less Traveled

__________________________________________________________

**2011**- Theocracy win a squeaker.  The Gift of Music may have been the deciding factor. 

Theocracy- As the World Bleeds

Dragonland- Under the Grey Banner

Riot- Immortal Soul

**2012**- Pythia out of nowhere to win.  This album has infinite reply value for me. 

Pythia- The Serpent’s Curse

Orden Ogan- To The End

Bejelit- Emerge

__________________________________________________________

**2013**- Keldian got all the attention last year, but Armory was the superior album

Armory- Empyrean Realms

Keldian- Outbound

DGM- Momentum

__________________________________________________________

**2014**- Nothing comes close to Noble Beast this year.  Nothing. 

Noble Beast- S/T

Triosphere- The Heart of the Matter

Viathyn- Cynosure

And 2008 was a weak year?! There's at least like. . .6 albums I'd put ahead of 2 of your top 3 there :-/ Falconer, Avantasia, Secret Sphere, Revolution Renaissance (I know, I know, I'm the only one that *loves* that album), Stormwarrior, Leverage. . .

As for Falconer, I know I will always be in the minority that thinks they aren't genre defining.  They are solid in every aspect but they never wowed me for some reason.  And honestly, the only Falconer album I listen to is Grime Vs Grandeur(Which I'm pretty sure is sacrilege because of the change in singers.)"

"My favorite PM albums from each year.","Hopefully you check your inbox, because I don't have time to write my feedback now, but will leave it over the coming days. Regardless of my disagreements, though, this is a VERY well thought-out list, hitting all the main camps of power metal. Great job."
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","Japan?"
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","Keep up the good fight. I keep discovering great bands from Japan and I barely knew they had a scene few years ago. Thy should get some more attention."
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","I can imagine how hard narrowing down the lists from 1995-2002 must have been.  So many classics released in that time frame.

Only complaints, nothing from Angel Dust nor did you include Edguy's Mandrake."
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","I was surprised about Angel Dust as Well.  Border of Reality was really close, but in the end I went with Free the Beast because the riffs on that album don't stop. "
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","Seeing Pagans Mind take a top spot was a nice surprise."
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","Jumped straight to 1998 just to make sure."
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","I'm surprised how many great albums we agree on here. I've always thought of you, Mushman, as the contrarian of the PM subreddit, but apparently not to the extent I thought.

I opened the thread and scrolled straight to 2003, ready to be annoyed by the lack of Lost Horizon, but there it is. There's their debut too, and there's the fantastic Beyond the Space, Beyond the Time. All well deserving winners. Theocracy too, was a surprise. I love that album.

I've never listened to Manilla Road -- I forget why -- but as it's popped up so many times, and as we share similar tastes *apparently*, I'll have to check them out. You got a good starting point for me?"
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","&gt;I opened the thread and scrolled straight to 2003, ready to be annoyed by the lack of Lost Horizon, but there it is.

Are you kidding? Only /u/UnlostHorizon rivals /u/mushmancat for biggest Lost Horizon circlejerker I have ever seen..."
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","wait wait wait. I have a rival? "
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","There can only be one. "
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","I think you just got the position!"
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","I suggest starting chronologically with Crystal logic(skipping their first two albums). Open the gates is my favorite though. 

I'd also warn to not give up on them right away if they don't click at first. The vocals can be offputting. It also took me quite awhile to appreciate their brand of epic sound. Once it clicks though, its so worth it. 

"
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","I saw Manilla Road live a couple years back and was really impressed (having not heard them before but being aware of the reputation) But have put off getting their albums for so long. I finally picked up Open the Gates last week and I have to say, it's probably going to (as you said) take a few spins through to really let it sink in. But I also finally picked up Abigail by King Diamond. So my attention has been slim towards anything else."
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","Astronomy was shit compared to Starfall. Worst DL album imo"
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","I go back and forth with starfall all the time.  At times I love it and then other times its just too poppy for me. Thats why I prefer Astronomy.  Also, anyone who thinks Dragonlands first two albums are good, let alone better than Astronomy are out of their minds. "
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","I'd forgotten about Battle of the Ivory Plains.....*shudders*"
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","Agreed. *Starfall* may be my #3 power metal album of all time. Very likely my most listened over the past 10 years."
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","Starfall is my #5. Cynosure by Viathyn recently took over #2."
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","What, but it has Supernova and The Old House On The Hill.."
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","2 songs a good album does not make"
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","All the songs on the album are good but the two I mentioned are just something else. Is Starfall not as good of a recording quality as Astronomy? That may be my problem with it"
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","It's older, do they probably had less money to spend on production "
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","What about Theocracy's Mirror of Souls on 08? And Cellador's Enter Deception on 06? What about Titan Force? Fifth Angel?

Cool list, i would replace a bunch of stuff though. The Stratovarius mention though, i would have never expect, they are so overrated in my opinion and sadly, the ones who brought flower metal to this world. A good case of an excellent guitarist getting eclipsed by a bunch of noodle wankery keyboarding and flowery melodies.

Also, which year did you thought had the better 3 releases? I'm gonna say it was 85, i would put Jericho at the top but fuck, that year saw some of the best power metal and heavy/speed that had that power metal vein."
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","Holy shit. I just straight up forgot to put Mirror of Souls. Thanks for reminding me.

As for best 3. For me its 88, 93, 89, 85. "
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","Titan Force in 1989 for sure. That's a top 3 album.

I think that's the year. On my phone, in bed, too lazy to look it up."
"My favorite PM albums from each year.","Good USPM picks. I dont really care for european power metal save for Running Wild and bands oriented towards 80s uspm.
I kind of expected Awaken The Guardian to be in your top 3 for 1986 but it is not. In my opinion its the best album ever made.

Pharaoh's Longest Night is prob my favorite power metal album of the last decade.
Have you heard Antiquus? I think their second especially is great.

"Who's in the mood for GLORYHAMMER!?@!?!? - ""The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee""","I absolutely love this album. This album and band are to power metal as the Zucker Brothers and 'Airplane' is to the disaster movies.  Completely self aware (even down to the track order!),  serious about not taking themselves seriously, use every power metal trope in existence, and they make sure to back it up with spot on performances.

Wouldn't expect anything less from a Christopher Bowes inspired project :) "
"Who's in the mood for GLORYHAMMER!?@!?!? - ""The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee""","What's this about the track order? I don't get it, you mean the story progression?"
"Who's in the mood for GLORYHAMMER!?@!?!? - ""The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee""","I've realized over the years that some of the best albums I've heard have certain kinds of tracks in certain spots on the albu and Tales from the Kingdom of Fife

1) 30 sec-1 minute opener

2) Killer song that feeds right off of said opener that may or may not pass for the lead single (like Lion From the North on Carolus Rex), check.

3)Token ballad midway through

4) Another killer song right after the ballad (like Warriors on Freedom Call's Eternity)

5) Solid instrumental bit near the end (like Revontulet from Sonata Arctica's slience)

6) Token 10+ minute epic to end the album


"
"Who's in the mood for GLORYHAMMER!?@!?!? - ""The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee""","Gloryhammer have the same problem as Dethklok. They put all the humour into the lyrics, while putting all their creative effort into the music, leaving people at a sort of standstill where they don't know if they're supposed to like it or not. Personally I think the music on the album is great, and the funny lyrics are enjoyable on another level. The thing about ""not taking themselves seriously"", is that people seem to assume that because you don't take yourself seriously, then you can't be serious about the music, but really the music is just as good as these other PM bands, it's the fact that they don't take themselves seriously that sets them apart. Are they any better than most power metal bands? Probably not, but the fact you can sing along with a smile on your face to these stupid lyrics is what people like about them."
"Who's in the mood for GLORYHAMMER!?@!?!? - ""The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee""","Is it the unicorn bit that's throwing people off? The lyrics on the album doesn't seem that much out of the ordinary for this branch of power metal if you replace unicorn with dragon or similar."
"Who's in the mood for GLORYHAMMER!?@!?!? - ""The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee""","See, the thing is that most of the critics of Gloryhammer are primarily concerned on the *music*, which is terribly generic and rather dull in the eyes of many. It takes a lot for lyrics to turn me away from a song (it would have to make a successful attempt at being terribly offensive and serious about it) - they can certainly help a song, but a song can be fantastic with its lyrics being nothing more than gibberish. But when uninspired, inelegant, and derivative instrumentation is the best an album can do, I lose interest quickly. The vocals are good, though."
"Who's in the mood for GLORYHAMMER!?@!?!? - ""The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee""","Stop making valid points. Gloryhammer fanboys have decided that any and all criticism of the band must be because of the lyrics and that's final! It obviously has nothing to do with the lack of songwriting ability. "
"Who's in the mood for GLORYHAMMER!?@!?!? - ""The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee""","I don't know how many times we have to say it. No one gives a shit about the lyrics, its the completely generic songwriting. Its the same problem with Alestorm, the dude doesn't know how to write compelling music. "
"Who's in the mood for GLORYHAMMER!?@!?!? - ""The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee""","That's not true, Alestorm's last album is considerably better than anything he put out and I actually think its a very good power metal album. The keyboards in the Gloryhammer album are actually not bad and the keyboard solos end up stealing the show. The guitar and bass are just horribly bland."
"Who's in the mood for GLORYHAMMER!?@!?!? - ""The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee""","I don't see it. Im certain that without the pirate schtick Ale storm would be completely obscure. "

*****  
What you may have missed [last week](http://redd.it/2vvkct)...

Nothing, son.

*****  
###Recommendations of the week  
##/u/Fazermint:  
My recommendations for this week are fourfold. First off, **Crimson Wind** sounds like some solid symphonic power. It's pretty standard fare, but well executed. The vocalist is talented enough, and the symphonic elements are plentiful. If you enjoy symphonic power, give them a listen.

**Evertale**'s *Of Dragons and Elves* was an unsigned debut release back in 2013, and now they are re-releasing via NoiseArt Records. And it is awesome. Fantasy-based, epic-vibe power metal right there. This is easily my favorite track this week... but it's an old one, so it doesn't count. I'm definitely gonna try and get my hands on this one, regardless.

A lot of speed metal releases this week. My favorite of the bunch is **Enforcer**'s ""Undying Evil"", which is a true blast from the past. It's some impressive speed metal with a glam metal voice. I don't have much else to say, it's just some awesome old-school stuff.

And finally, in the unclean vocals corner, **Exthenia**'s single is a masterpiece. That melodic intro just totally blew me away.

##/u/MadTheMad:  
I'm more than happy to recommend **Evil Invaders** plate of speed riffing and screeching accompanied with silly imagery and wording. The song takes us back in time to the thrashy 80s metal era and it's one speed baller of a song, it kicks off with the silly over the top intro (fits the image of the band) with wicked screaming vocals and evolves into a smashing and bashing force of nature. Everything is reminiscent of older times but at the same time feels like brand new polished metal; the band takes inspiration from stuff like early Metallica and Razor (The name of the band is the name of an album from Razor).

I highly recommend Evil Invaders if you are into pure 80s speed/thrash worship with a modern touch, I know I will be getting the album as soon as I can. There's one thing I want to point out though and I'm not entirely positive of this but, it sounds like the drummer is not using a double bass... I know, jaw dropping right? A Speed Metal track with no frenetic pedaling these days is a very rare sight, just like the Bigfoot.

Lastly, nothing comes close to Evil Invaders this week but **Exthenia** stands out as something interesting, apocalyptic, deathly... Can't formulate words to express my feelings towards this song; it's a different (albeit generic in structure and pacing) eerie piece of melodeath and keyboarding insanity, worth a check most definitely.

##/u/omegakingauldron:  
A lot of the music here is good and worthwhile, with some standing out more than others. **Evertale** gets the highest of recommendations, being that it’s what we all want; Power Metal, Fantasy and speed. The only problem I had was that it’s a re-issue, but don’t let that stop you from listening to it/picking it up.

Otherwise, my recommendation of the week will go to **Enforcer**. This is mostly because I got that NWOBHM vibe from them, and I am always down for that sound. It even hit the main rule of music for me; if I’m singing along to the chorus on the first listen, you are a worthwhile song/band (yes I know there was a lyric video, but I was actually not looking at it while listening).

And since my colleagues mentioned it, **Exthenia** is an interesting case. I wasn’t keen on the vocals at all, but I liked it instrumentally. It’s worth a curious listen, but I don’t see much value in it after that.

*****  
/u/MadTheMad: [MRW I get the high honor of recommending songs on the release week](http://i.imgur.com/jaC8kbk.png)"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/23 - 3/1)","Another week, more power metal! Excellent, let's get to it.

**Furyon: Lost Salvation** - Calculatedly written mainstream rock, it's the same formula you hear on radio all the time, it's boring.

**Crimson Wind: Last Poetry Line** - If you haven't heard of these guys, their first album showed some promise but ultimately felt flat. This song showcases what I tend to dislike in symphonic based acts, the pristine keyboarding eclipsing the guitar. It's not a bad song by all means, it's the never ending sense of déjà vu constantly popping on these new symphonic power metal songs. 

**The Storyteller: Sacred Fire** - Biggest problem with this band is the name, when you name your band ""The Storyteller"" you build this minor expectation that a story will be told but a story is never told. The song is just okay but the vocalist stands out and I always have been a fan of him and I always wondered how much better he would sound in other bands.

**Evertale: Of Dragons and Elves** - Ah yes, Evertale... the oh-so praised band that released this majestic 90s Blind Guardian worship album that kicked multiple bare backs and melted faces. I can give you my opinion on the full album rather than the song because I listened to it quite a bit. The album is 80 minutes long and it should instead clock in at 40 to 50 minutes meaning there's a lot of fat to be cut here; another problem is the chaotic musicianship going on here; ever heard of Slayer being called chaotic? That's because they're songs often had these [moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Wnn47V09Q2M#t=170) of pure guitar and drum noise and even some [riffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeAV3LTNGks) where a complete mess but worked wonders. This album on the other hand is ""bad chaos"", there are a lot of moments on the album that just sounds like they went insane and decided to mix all music samples the mixing program could muster and create this wall of messy sound. In the end, I highly recommend this album because it has a lot of neat ideas and this song is pretty good.

**Wolfpakk: Rise of the Animal** - Have you ever noticed how Sonata Arctica are obsessed with wolves? Well, these guys seem even more obsessed except they suck. Boring overdone Heavy Metal track. Not even going to talk about how stupid the name of the song is, sounds like a quote coming out of a Worms game.

**Enforcer: From Beyond** - Sweden speed junkies made a pretty good album in 2010 called Diamonds (totally deserves a check). This song sounds a tad safer than usual but it's a good song nonetheless. It has this weird segment in the middle of the song that I think is really cool.

**Trauma: Rapture and Wrath** - Well, everything is pretty fucking good but the vocalist just lacks in power, this song needed that screaming voice, that powerful punch to the ear because seriously, the guitars rule. Even the guitar overall production needed a bit more of ""intensification"" but I just can't get past the vocals. Worth a check, it's not power metal though.

**Forces United: II** - Vapid Stratovarius ripoff. Apparently it's an international project or some shit but I don't know anybody. There is some truly mediocre keyboards de-harmonizing(?) this bullshit Eurovision song.

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/23 - 3/1)","Glad to see Evertale getting a reissue, but I still think it'll be hard to acquire in North America at a decent price. With that said, I'd like to hear it, but it's too long for my tastes so I'll pass.

I'm looking forward to Enforcer's album. I don't think they'll be able to live up to Diamonds, but if this is anything like the last one, it should be pretty solid.

The Evil Invaders album is pretty good. I actually had higher expectations for it, but any fan of speed metal should be satisfied with it. [Here's](http://skullfracturingmetal.blogspot.ca/2015/02/evil-invaders-pulses-of-pleasure.html) my review if anyone is interested."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/23 - 3/1)","So weird, I was literally listening to Enforcer yesterday and said they were due for a new album.  Sadly that song didn't excite me too much.  A step down from Death by Fire would be understandable though, because it was such a good album. 

An Evertale reissue is interesting. Is it better production or something?  That was actually one of my favorite albums the year it originally came out, so I will have to check this out. "
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/23 - 3/1)","My first time hearing Enforcer, I will check Death by Fire out.

And as far as I know the Evertale releases are identical. I could be wrong, but I couldn't find any official promotional vids"

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/23 - 3/1)","It was me. It was always meeee."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/23 - 3/1)","I'm really excited for the new Enforcer. I'm still mesmerized by their last album but I'm hoping this one is just as good.

Trauma I'm looking forward to aswell, seeing as their one of the older of the bunch. More USPM oriented and their debut *Scratch and Scream* is quite notable. Seems they went into a more trad/speed direction according to their new song.

Evil Invaders is horrible. The vox are just...bland 80s thrash. This is coming from a guy who is love with a lot 80s thrash but this is bad. It's mediocre at best to me.

Evertale had something last year and just dropped the ball to me. The rest of their music just didn't deliver, so I'm not really looking forward to the reissue. "

"Sabaton- En Livstid I Krig",""
"Sabaton- En Livstid I Krig","I was indifferent to the whole ""the Swedish version of Carolus Rex is the best version"" argument until I heard this with the translated lyrics. It's a shame we don't get to hear Swedish Joakim more often."
"Sabaton- En Livstid I Krig","Yes. This song with the Swedish lyrics is probably the most powerful thing Sabaton has ever written.

I remember the first time seeing this live was on the 70K cruise in 2013. It was misty/slightly drizzling and I remember looking up and watching the rain come down and it was the most ethereal feeling I've ever had; I still can't describe it. I remember turning to my buddy and saying something super morbid like: ""If I died right now, I'd be okay.""

I've only heard them play it in Swedish one time since then (Rockstad Falun 2014) and it was great but nothing like that first time."
"Sabaton- En Livstid I Krig","That sounds magical. I remember an experience like that seeing my favourite Japanese band on their first and only North American tour. They finished their set playing my favourite song and kept it going for a good ten extra minutes. I was standing there, smiling like an idiot, completely dumbfounded. I remember feeling the same way, like it was all I needed in life. 

Music is a pretty cool thing, and I can't wait to see Sabaton again in the spring."
"Sabaton- En Livstid I Krig","I sort of wish that Sabaton had just used a translation of the Swedish as the English version. I get why they did it how they did, but it takes so much longer to memorize lyrics in a language I don't understand, and I have a harder time enjoying the slightly cheesier English lyrics. I should learn Swedish."
"Sabaton- En Livstid I Krig","Saw the guys performing this song live in munich last wednesday.  
Absolute stunning performance, they could sing swedish more often at their concerts!"
"Sabaton- En Livstid I Krig","These guys just don't get talked about enough!"
"Anthriel - Devil's Lullaby",""
"Anthriel - Devil's Lullaby","This whole album is pretty awesome in my opinion.

I get the vibe that the whole thing is kinda like a concept album about escaping the past and starting anew, but I haven't checked the lyric book (despite having listened to the whole thing through at least 10 times) so I won't place any money on that assertion. "
"Anthriel - Devil's Lullaby","It's a great album. [Chains of the Past is my favorite.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RcCy_92K_4) So many good harmonies.   

&gt;But how could I leave without a wound      
&gt;in the spirit that carries me on? *(carries me on!)*
"
"Anthriel - Devil's Lullaby","The album is based on the character from fantasy writer R.A. Salvatore named [Drizzt Do'Urden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drizzt_Do%27Urden). The Pathway is based on the events of the [Dark Elf Trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Elf_Trilogy) of books concerning Drizzt.

I've been waiting for these guys to make another album for years.

"
"Anthriel - Devil's Lullaby","I remember that they were recording bass for their new album. I think that it was November. So hopefully maybe this year we will hear something new from them."

"BRIDEAR / Light In The Dark Japanese girls PM",""
"BRIDEAR / Light In The Dark Japanese girls PM","[Oh boy. This'll go down well](http://i.imgur.com/uo5VfuA.gif)"
"BRIDEAR / Light In The Dark Japanese girls PM","First off: Way more legit than Babymetal. They're at least playing the music instead of dancing in front of it.

However, this doesn't seem like power metal to me. Besides the awful growling, the rhythms they used felt much darker(?) than what are used in power metal. (Does that make sense? I'm not really sure how to phrase that.)"
"BRIDEAR / Light In The Dark Japanese girls PM","Time for me to chime in.

First off, why compare this to BABYMETAL? This should be compared to other all-female JPM bands like Cyntia, Aldious, and Mary's Blood, or just JPM in general. Comparing it to BABYMETAL is like comparing Pagan's Mind to Amaranthe.


Secondly, power metal *is* allowed to be darker. There's plenty of minor scale power metal out there that sounds darker. I'll even give you some JPM examples.

Jupiter - ""[Arcadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xQM778WyeE)""  
Aldious - ""[Butterfly Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la-DglMydVs)""  
Versailles - ""[Aristocrat's Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU0uLZWqRdE)""

Regardless of how you feel about JPM, those are all undeniably power metal songs. They may border on speed metal, but it's the clean vocals that distinguish them from speed metal, which prefers more thrashy styles of vocalization.

Finally, as for the growls, power metal is slowly leaning towards a greater inclusion of growls recently. Bands like [Crimson Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJh7fSr0cRc), [Viathyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDL26Jl-Vt4), and [Rhapsody of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aItNg5SDX9Q) have all been including more and more harsh vocals in their music (with varying amounts, of course). The line between melodic death metal and power metal is being VERY blurred these days, with bands like [Nothgard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDKfKotvEZ4) and [Primalfrost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99dsIMoVqng) straddling the line between the two subgenres. 

Now to get back on-topic, Bridear primarily uses clean vocals. That's enough for them to not fall under melodic death metal. In addition, their music is fast, melodic, and catchy. I don't even like them, but it's quite absurd to say they're not power metal. They even have the same typical power metal drumbeat going on. If you really want to, I guess you could include metalcore in their description, but to ignore the power metal descriptor just isn't right. Purists might not agree with me, but even the Metal Archives has them listed as ""power metal"", and we all know how finicky they can be with genres.

And that's my mini-thesis while I wait to take my exam. "
"Any Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?","I need some help understanding where the fandom is. I discovered Rhapsody of Fire roughly 2 years ago and have been in love ever since, I mean what kind of Godly band can make music that NEVER gets old? That case of ""I listened to a song so much that I hate it"" just doesn't happen with this band.

Yet, I still don't know how famous they are, if they still do concerts, or where to find a damn fanbase. Reddit has everything, right? Well the Rhapsody of Fire subreddit has a single post from 5 years ago... Can anyone tell me firstly how famous they are, perhaps put it into some sort of comparison to a famous band, tell me whether or not they still tour or are even a band anymore, and where I can find somewhere to connect with fans?"
"Any Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?","I would say they are one of the better-known power metal bands. The creator split off to make another separate group, Luca Turilli's Rhapsody. He took some of the fans with him, and a good bit of the creative energy as well - I felt that LT Rhapsody's debut was stronger than the post-LT Rhapsody of Fire album. LT Rhapsody is also working on a new album they have teased on Facebook.

I know Rhapsody of Fire did a US tour a year or so ago - not sure if they plan more, or if LT Rhapsody will be around.

I'd say that this place is as good as any to connect with fans - there are a lot of us around here!"
"Any Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?","I love Luca Turilli's interviews dude is so enthusiastic and you can see the passion he has for music, also he has a funny english accent. I can't wait to hear Prometheus, Symphonia Ignis Divinus."
"Any Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?","I love what I am seeing of this subreddit, but I feel like I would more so enjoy a Subreddit that I could post purely for rhapsody of fire fans, because there is a whole lot that I would love to post about them, but I would feel very awkward posting it all her, as this is a subreddit for Power Metal in general, and I don't want to flood it with pure Rhapsody fanboyism.

If I were to make a subreddit for Rhapsody of Fire, or if I could get someone more qualified to jump on it, do you think that it would recieve any support here? I would very much so like to start one or help in ones maturity."
"Any Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?","To be fair, there's enough Blind Guardian and Lost Horizon circlejerk here that some Rhapsody circlejerk could probably do us some good :D"
"Any Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?","Do you think it would be fine if I posted umm.. a few... dozen... things?"
"Any Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?","A little while back there were these [Beginner's Guide threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/search?q=guide&amp;restrict_sr=on) that were very popular at the time (not just here but in /r/metal too http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/search?q=guide&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).


Doesn't look like someone made one for ROF so if you feel like you're up for it maybe you could give that a try. It'll give you a chance to convey your thoughts on each album and the band as a whole. Then again I don't know exactly what it is specifically you want to discuss about them but I think it could still be a good idea (again if you're up for it)."
"Any Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?","I'll look into that."
"Any Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?","They are well known among the power metal circle.....however even though known I have come across alot of PM fans that think that ROF is a bit TOO much. I dont mind. I love em! Cheese it up! "
"Any Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?","I wouldn't say that they have a massive fanbase, but it depends where you are. If you in the European mainland you will probably have more vision of them than in the UK or US. 

They are probably as famous as most power metal bands in the UK and US, maybe a little more niche due to their style but if you can find a power metal scene you will be able to find some Rhapsody fans. 

They aren't one band anymore. They split into two Rhapsody bands. Both are technically Rhapsody, just one has Luca and the other doesn't. Personally I think Luca's guitar makes Rhapsody who they are. Alex's signing is a big part too but Luca us what made me gall in love with them on the Power of the Dragonflame album! "
"Any Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?","I don't know how famous they are but they are still doing concerts. I saw them last year as a supporting act for Gamma Ray and it was absolutely amazing. Their singer even did a couple of songs for them."
"Any Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?","When I was a teenager they were quite famous in Argentina. They played here several times. Now I don't even know if Luca Turilli is still making albums."
"Any Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?","I totally agree, I can never get enough of Rhapsody."

"Qantice- Phantonaut (vocal cover by Yannis Papadopoulos)","I'll say I'm one of the few that like PelleK, but I didn't find Qantice as good as I expected, though having Yannis do the vocals is a great idea."

"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?",""
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","At the third place, i'd put **Blind Guardian's Somewhere Far Beyond**. Easily their best album, there are some stuff that i would definitely change in the album but i have been hearing the album on a monthly basis ever since i know about Blind Guardian, in a way it's perfect and at the same time flawed, but just the right ""consistency"" flaws and perfection (i'm bad at words).

At the second place, **Rhapsody's The Power of the Dragonflame**. Some say this isn't that special and it has too much fanfare, fuck them i say, i fucking love fanfare and i think that this is their best album and one that i always come back to. Agony Is My Name is a powerhouse of a song.

At first place, **Helloween's Walls of Jericho**. You can argue this is more Speed than Power but i like to think it's both and it's easily one of my top 10 albums of all time, there isn't one weak moment on the album and all tracks are near perfect. Ride The Sky is an example of a song i would call perfect as i would not change anything."

"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","* Sonata Arctica - Winterheart's Guild. The culmination of their Strato Arctica days and the beginning of their experimentation. Contains so many great songs, spanning from the high tempo power metal approach on Victoria's Secret and The Cage, to the dark ballads of Gravenimage, The Misery and Broken.

* Sabaton - Art Of War. The Sabaton album in my opinion. All of their albums are amazing, but this one is so full of the historical based lyrics they have become known for, on top of some truly epic compositions.

* Helloween - Keeper Of The Seventh Keys Pt. 2. One influence to rule them all."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","I still can't stand Broken after all these years.  xD"

"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Only going to do one album per band... otherwise this post would be entirely Blind Guardian

Blind Guardian - Nightfall in Middle-earth. My first power metal album, and it remains my greatest love. It could be said that my entire adventure through music has been trying to recapture the emotions I experienced when first listening to this album...

Gamma Ray - Land of the Free. I consider this album to be the finest example of 'pure' power metal. There aren't any tricks or gimmicks here, just raw power metal excellence from one of the genre's founders.

Angra - Rebirth. For power metal with neo-classical elements, Angra is the best there is, and they've always done a great job of balancing catchy with depth - second only to Blind Guardian, in my opinion. Their South American origin proves to be a boon on this album as they borrow influence from local music.

Honorable mentions: Kamelot - Epica, Falconer - Black Moon Rising"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Nightfall in Middle Earth is something to experience. It actually got me to go back and finish reading The Silmarillion, which is an incredible story, and being able to put the songs with the story just made it that much more incredible."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","It's really hard for me to pick just three, as there are probably 3 more I don't want to leave out, but here they are, somewhat in order:

**Dragonforce - Valley of the Damned**

This album is pretty much perfect for me. While I love their later work with ZP, this album had the best blend of songwriting and over-the-top soloing. The bass playing is the best it would ever be for Dragonforce, and every song is exceptionally catchy. Even though I spend a lot of time reviewing music, this is one album where I just don't know how to express how much I enjoy it.


**Avantasia - The Scarecrow**

This one might be a bit on the edge of the definition of power metal, but for me, it's the best thing Tobias Sammet has ever done. Jorn Lande proves he is the greatest Avantasia vocalist aside from Tobi with his performance on the title track (and others) here. Even though some tracks on this album are incredibly far away from metal, they work in the context of the album. Getting to hear Alice Cooper sing with Tobi was really special for me because Alice is probably my favourite artist of all time.

**Lost Horizon - Awakening The World**

This album gave me a bit of a fresh perspective on power metal. Sure, it should still be catchy and epic, but Lost Horizon's music just sounds ""transcendent"". It's like something completely different and unique to the band and will never be duplicated again. Daniel Heiman is the most talented vocalist I've ever heard, and his performance is astounding. It almost sounds like he's acting at times with the way he manipulates his voice. "
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","&gt; The bass playing is the best it would ever be for Dragonforce

I've seen them many times over the years with several bass players, and Diccon is certainly the best live bass player they've had."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Did you really expect a guitar player to be a good bass player anyway? xD"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","I've only been listening to power metal for about a year, but here goes. I'm going to limit it to one album per band, otherwise it would just be the same band. 

* **Blind Guardian - Nightfall in Middle-Earth.**
This is my favorite album, like, ever. If I were to rate all the songs on the album, all but one would get 5/5 stars. Just love this album to bits.
* **Persuader - When Eden Burns.** I only just thought it was 'good' when I first listened to it, but after many listens more and some months later, it has become one of my favorite albums. I would say now that it's 'fantastic'.
* **Sabaton - Carolus Rex.** This one was a difficult choice. I was unsure who to have 3rd but eventually I decided on this album, my favorite from Sabaton. I like most of the songs on this albums, and some of them I just love. 

This list is definitely be different after a year or so."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","First I would say:

**Sabaton - Coat of Arms**

This is the album that was a gateway for me into metal, I heard White Death in a discussion about Mosin Nagants, and sort of investigated from there. Before hearing this album, I dismissed a lot of metal as just screaming and distorted guitars, but this album really opened my eyes so it will always be my number one.

Second:

**Sonata Arctica - Silence**

I fell in love with Sonata after hearing Kingdom For a Heart, but it was Silence that really got me into them. ""The Power of One"" is such an incredible song and just makes the album for me.

And finally:

**Blind Guardian - A Twist in the Myth**

I actually received this album in a sale where you got an assortment of albums that were randomly selected. I had never listened to Blind Guardian much before, I was aware of them but never got into them. When I received this album, I started listening to it on my way to and from work, and it just resonates with me. I especially like ""Carry the Blessed Home"" and ""Skalds and Shadows""."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","I absolutely love The Power of One. I put Silence on my list as well, it just works so well as a complete album."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Very, very difficult to narrow it down to just 3, but here goes:

* **Blind Guardian -- ""Imaginations from the other side""**. Pretty much the perfect album. This was where the promise of their earlier albums was realised. Of course, ""Nightfall..."" is equally as good, but I had to pick just one to leave room for my other two selections.

* **Sabaton -- ""The art of war""**. For reasons that seem ridiculous now, I held off on getting this album for quite a while. I was unimpressed by the cover artwork and I'd convinced myself that there was no way it could live up to the magnificence of ""Primo victoria"" and ""Attero dominatus"". I was wrong. Very, very wrong.

* **Angel Dust -- ""Enlighten the darkness""**. A band that's always been overlooked, but for me, they were right up there with the best. I loved Dirk Thurisch's vocals and all of the albums after the band reformed were fantastic."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","3 **Symphony X - Iconoclast**- The talent in this band is unreal, every member is great at playing what they play. I absolutely love the instrumentation in their albums. Lyrics and vocalist are also awesome. The first track on the album is something I can never get enough of. I know it's more prog, but idc bro.

2 **Lost Horizon - A Flame to the Ground Beneath**
I have two ""Highlander"" tracks in my library so I hear it more often.
Probably the most powerful of Power Metal albums. Motivating as hell. As one reviewer said ""Where death or thrash music can make you feel angry, this album makes you feel like a god""

1 **Reckoning Night - Sonata Arctica**
My favorite of Sonata Arctica's works. What I consider their magnum opus, awesome lyrics and feel all over the place. First thing I bought from the CD store when I visited Japan so I could get the JPN digipak with Wrecking the Sphere. Not ridiculously powerful, but it does amazing at what Sonata is (was?) good at, melancholic powerish metal with interesting themes and lyrics. Every song on here, with possibly the exception of The Boy who Wanted to be a Real Puppet, is amazing lyrically and instrumentally.

**Honorable mentions:**

Firewind's Between Heaven and Hell

Crystal Eyes' Chained

Iced Earth's Horror Show

Dream Evil's Dragonslayer

Sonata Arctica's Ecliptica/Silence/Winterheart's Guild

**and more recent amazing stuff (IE they would be on this list if the nostalgia factor wasn't there):**

Borealis' Fall from Grace

Instanzia's Ghosts

Cellador's Enter Deception

Primalfrost's Prosperous Visions

Viathyn's Cynosure

Keldian's Outbound"

:O"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","That's the token sort-of-out-of-place song on there. "
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","The instrumental is what I would leave out, and I'm still not a big fan of Blinded."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","I didn't like blinded until I started listening to For The Sake of Revenge's live CD a bunch. Then it grew on me.

These days even the boy who wanted to be a real puppet (say that 5 times fast) is growing on me"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","I find the first guitar solo very grating, but the song evolves in a good way. It's the only SA album that I hated on the first listen. :S"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","It's hard to pin it down since these things always change, but right now:

#3 Galneryus - Resurrection

Basically what I'm looking for in modern power metal. Best one from Galneryus (especially their closing song), best solos concentrated on a single album for me. It helps when like 3 out of the 5 band members are musical geniuses.

#2 Timeless Miracle - Into the Enchanted Chamber

I swear if these guys announce a new album I'll shriek like a twelve year old fangirl. You can't beat classics like ""Curse of the Werewolf"", ""Return of the Werewolf"" and ""The Red Rose"".

#1 Sonata Arctica - Ecliptica

Power metal climaxed for me at this one. I know they're basically worshipping Stratovarius here but none of the Stratovarius albums hold a candle to this one (not Visions that's for sure; maybe Infinite). I can't name another album that has so much energy - I can't describe it better - flowing through it that the band members can barely contain it. Also I don't know how many times this album has been copied by european power metal bands. "
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Linky to the tribute in which Timeless Miracle is coming back:
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouerghrecords/a-tribute-to-sonata-arctica-album-release"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Timeless Miracle have actually very recently come back. They are recording a Sonata Arctica cover for a tribute album and then will likely be releasing a second album.That shrieking you just made...i did the same :D"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Great to see another Galneryus fan, such an underatted band imo."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","It's a tough one, but one I'm confident in.

**Nightfall in Middle Earth - Blind Guardian**

Although a lot of people have this on their list as well, for me, this is the album that defines Blind Guardian to me. It has the big, epic sound on tracks, it retains the trashy moments, it has the slower ballads, and yet everything works out on this album.

**The Metal Opera - Avantasia**

The Power Metal album that got me into concept albums. Amazing story, amazing songs, and it got me to go back and listen to Kiske-era Helloween as well as go out and search for bands similar to this style (such as Ayreon)

**Something Wicked This Way Comes - Iced Earth**

Power and Thrash unite! It's the album I recommend to every new fan of Iced Earth as well as to fans of Power Metal in general.

**Honurable Mentions;**

Black Sun - Primal Fear, Fourth Legacy - Kamelot, Keeper of the Seven Keys Part 1 - Helloween, Powerplant - Gamma Ray"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","3 - Powerwolf - Blood of the Saints

2 - Hammerfall - Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken

1 - Blind Guardian - At the Edge of Time"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Gamma Ray - Power Plant

Rhapsody - Power of the Dragonflame

Blind Guardian - At the Edge of Time"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","I was thinking about this on the way home from work the other day. If I had 3 albums to try to make someone a fan of power metal, which ones would I choose? As music that makes me feel things that nothing else really can, it's an inspiring and rejuvenating part of my life - a form of therapy in itself. 

Anyways, I'll cut to the chase. My top 3 (in no particular order are):

**Dragonland - Starfall**

The first power metal song I ever heard was ""Storming Across Heaven"" by Dragonland, and I was instantly hooked - something my brain had never heard before. While the rest of that album is a little above mediocre in my opinion, Starfall (as of now) is my favorite album by them. This prog/power masterpiece has no shortfalls. From the beginning to the end, I'm taken on a journey through almost every feeling in the emotional spectrum.

The keyboards and guitar on this album are exceptional. If power metal has gotten stale for you recently, then I recommend checking this album out if you haven't already.

**Firewind - Between Heaven and Hell**

Being the first power metal I ever owned, it was one hell of an introduction. Every song is spectacular. Gus G is on point in every solo, and each song has its own unique catchiness to it. The choruses on this album epitomize the bombastically emotional hook that has kept me a fan of this genre for many years. Personally, I think this album is Gus's best work. I only wish this lineup had stayed together over the years.

**Avantasia - Metal Opera Pt. 2**

This was another one of the first power metal albums I ever owned. I think this is Avantasia's best work. The first song, ""The Seven Angels,"" is one of my all time favorites. The rest of this album is gold as well. I like this a lot more than ""The Metal Opera Pt. 1."""
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Between Heaven and Hell? But... but... The Premonition, man. It's almost like people can have a different opinion to me..."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Premonition for me had some weak tracks. It's got some great hooks though.

Also whenever I listen to Mercenary Man I can't help but hear ""Paint with all the colors of the Wind"" from Pocahontas during the chorus.

No, that can't be unheard. (I still love that track btw, it's just funny that it sounds similar)"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Hah, fair enough. For me, while it does have some weaker tracks, it's nothing I'd actually skip. A lot of gold though."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","This is a great ""indie"" or lesser known list. Seems like you kind of skipped all the big bands on purpose with this list."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Or, you know, those are his favorites."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Lesser known bands totally headline wacken all the time...."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Ugh this fucking community is sooooo metalhipster. "
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","No, you not having a clue what your talking about while others do does not qualify as ""hipster"". If he named Moonville, Aethra, and Ultimatium youd have a point, but all three of the bands he listed are very well known by anyone with anything more than the most basic knowledge of power metal, and Tobias Sammet and Avantasia are among the biggest names in the genre. [This is not the stage show of a lesser known band.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcL1prrTFLY)

Going around criticizing people's picks when you most likely can only name the bands in the sidebar makes you look like a fucking idiot. So just stop.  "
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Exactly the response I expected."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","You think you won that, but really, you didn't."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","This is not hipster at all :P these are pretty well known bands."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Obey the sidebar. Right?"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Yeah, honestly, these are my favorite albums even compared to those by Blind Guardian, Stratovarius, Lost Horizon, etc... They just had an impression on me that the more known bands didn't."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","O_o"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","**1 Lost Horizon- A Flame to the Ground Beneath** - Better everything than everything else. 

**2 Lost Horizon- Awakening the World**- LH was a perfect storm of everything I look for in power metal. 

**3 Edguy- The Savage Poetry**- The Shawshank Redemption of movies.  One of the tracks will come up on random and i'll have no choice but to listen to the album in its entirety. "
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Completely agree with Lost Horizon. That band is one in a million. "
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Angra - rebirth

Kamelot - black halo

And uhhh..

Avantasia -metal opera pt 2"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Why part 2?"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Probably because of Seven Angels. Love that song, so good"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","**1. Rhapsody - Power Of The Dragonflame** - To me, this is the culmination of Rhapsody's creativity. This album has a perfect balance of aggression, flair, melody and orchestrations, with always perfect vocal performance to Fabio Lione to top it off. The other, often overlooked, aspect of Rhapsody are their lyrics. Some people tend look really superficially at them and not take them seriously because they are fantasy, but there are some masterfully crafted and beautifully poetic lyrics here.

From the great description of rage and anger in Knightrider Of Doom...

""IN THIS BLOODY DAWN

I WILL WASH MY SOUL

TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE

TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER

TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL

AND TO BE THE SON OF DOOM..."" 

...to strength of human spirit in Steelgods Of The Last Apocalypse...

 ""Raise all your eyes to the autumn skies

capture the energy of that sight

They can have fun with my limbs and bones

but I swear my spirit will never fall""

...or powerful images of destruction and death from Agony Is My Name... 

""Black is the rose that's now in my hand

black for the blood of the fallen

symbol of death will soon be reborn

into the life of my tears' fall...

reborn and grow!""

...they blend perfectly with the music to offer a truly unique journey into the wonderful world of the Enchanted Lands.

**2. Helloween - The Dark Ride** - If it is true that Helloween were pressured by their record company to release a darker album then the record company had it right for once. This album contains everything that is good about Hellowen. From funny and happy songs like Mr. Torture, to hymns like All Over The Nations, heavy Mirror Mirror or one of the best ballads ever written in If I Could Fly. Not only does this album not contain a single filler song, there is not a second of this album that I wish was made differently. Simply prefect from start to finish. 

**3. Wuthering Heights - Salt** - I've known about this band for a long time, but I'd never listened to them until fairly recently and I wished to kick my self in the nuts for waiting so long after I gave just one listen to this masterpiece. It might seem to some like another one of those pirate themed albums from seeing the cover or reading the title, but Salt is something else entirely. It is not a concept album in a traditional sense, but the motif of salt is used throughout as a metaphor(salty tears, sea etc.) for life's troubles. The music is a great blend of power and folk metal quite unlike anything I've heard before. And vocalist is the great Nils Patrik Johansson, who zou might know from Civil War and Astral Doors."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","That's not even a Helloween album!"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Come again?"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","*uh oh...*"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","**3 HammerFall - Infected**

Whaaaat, Infected? But *everyone* hates that album! Well, I guess they do, but that's because they're too busy crying about Hector and zombies to actually *listen to the music*. And once you do listen, you realize that Infected is the best that HammerFall has ever done. Also, (r)Evolution, fine album, but what the fuck were they thinking with that name.

**2 Kiuas - The New Dark Age**

*Fire rains down from the heavens, pouring down on those too weak to learn...*   This was the chorus that made me fall in love with Kiuas, and this album is really them at their best. A close second here would be Lustdriven, but I think that The New Dark Age is just a whee bit better.

**1 Falconer - Falconer**

Honestly, all of the Falconer albums for me are top notch, best of the best. But I have to choose one, so I'm choosing the most classic of them all. It has the greatest chain of Falconer songs (*Upon The Grave of Guilt* --&gt; *Entering Eternity*) and is consistently awesome. Although *Northwind* and *Among Beggars and Thieves* are close contendors for this, I think I really just have to give it to *the* classic album."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","I agree with you on Hammerfall. That's my personal favorite of theirs as well.

Kiuas' debut is like my second or third most played album ever. I couldn't get into *The New Dark Age*

And you know Falconer is my favorite band, but I think the self-titled may be their weakest album (with Mathias). Maybe I'm crazy. That wouldn't be in my top 4 of theirs :-O"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Odd nitpick but; if you're going to defend Infected because people can't get past the cover, how can you argue the (r)Evolution album's name?

Anyways, looks aside, Infected is their weakest album. Music wise, lyric wise, sound wise, it's an album I don't go back to at all in the Hammerfall discography."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","But the fact that some people will dismiss Infected because of the cover and theme is the issue that I have. I do think that it's a sort of subconscious bias that people have against Infected, because it really is a great album if you go into it with an open mind. But since people were already suspicious of it (and since we hate change ;D), most people ended up not liking it.

I personally like the (r)Evolution album, but it's still a stupid name for an album. Like, I could totally criticize Infected for its theme, which is fair, but that's not a reason to dislike the album. As such, I don't really think I'm being a hypocrite here. If I were to say I don't like (r)Evolution *because* of its name, then that would be hypocritical. But I like the album fine, and I'm reasonably able to say that it's a dumb name. Also, it's not like I'm dissing HammerFall or anything, I obviously like them, they took spot 3 on my list."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","[deleted]"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","No particular order.

**Versailles - JUBILEE**

i dont know the opinion of the community about versailles, many should think they're just some other visual band with fanfares, but i really like their concept of ""absolute beauty of form and the extremes of aestheticism"" that they brought to their music and style, this album is also really emotional because of the death of the bassist during the recording of JUBILEE, every song on this album is a creative pearl, that i'll never get tired of listening, ignore the stereotypes and go ahead to listen Versailles, you will find a great symphonic power metal band.

*Recommended Song(s): Catharsis / Aito Kanashimino Nocturne
My personal favorite: God Palace*

**Rhapsody - Symphony of Enchanted Lands II (yes, the second one!!)**

as you see, i really love fanfarres. i confess that the album gets to repetitive sometimes (last angel's call and shadows of death, specifically) but this is my favorite rhapsody album, from the band that introduced me to the power metal world, thank you emerald sword related link on yt!
i think everyone have listened this album, so w/e

**Galneryus - Beyond the End of Despair**

a really really power metal album now. every single track here is powerful and exciting, syu is a monster of guitar, he makes it speaks with you and you can feel it, the best vocal performance of Yama-B on galneryus, on this album he feels more comfortable then trying to be high pitched like on Flag of Punishment, anyway a great album from start to the end.

*Recommended Song(s): Shriek of the Vengeance / My Last Farewell
My personal favorite: Shiver*



Special mention to: BG - Nightfall on Middle-Earth, Kamelot - The Ghost Opera and Angra - Temple of Shadows."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Versailles were perfect, just not with the best production."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","Titanium - Titanium

Lost Horizon"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","1) **Sonata Arctica - Winterheart's Guild**

I can't even describe how much I love this album.  It is, in my opinion, the perfect power metal album.

2) **Nightwish - Century Child**

Century Child isn't even my favorite Nightwish album, but I don't think it would be fair or accurate to classify Imaginaerum, Once, or Dark Passion play as power metal.  That said, I think it's a tremendously good listen, and it improves on Wishmaster in every way.

3) **Cain's Offering - Gather the Faithful**

Jani Liimatainen's post-SA effort is cinematic, epic, and cheesy.  In other words, it makes for some terrific power metal.  I'm hopeful that they might one day reform and release a new album."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","[Jani has already confirmed a new CO album.](http://janihatesyouall.blogspot.nl/2014/11/some-answers.html)"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","In no particular order:
**Carolus Rex** by Sabaton. I really enjoy concept albums and this one tells a great story. It's a good history lesson and there are some subtle differences in the lyrics and song meanings between the English and Swedish versions. The variation in feeling isn't quite as strong on this one but it does in some points get across the atmosphere of the 1600s and 1700s, most notably in the introduction and the title track.

**Dark Assault** by Iron Savior. The atmosphere is excellent and the songs really get the mood and the story across. This is another album where the feelings of different songs are organized very well and build up some tension to the final tracks, Back into the Light and After the War.

**Silence** by Sonata Arctica. This isn't a concept album but it still feels like a cohesive unit. The song order and transitions between different feelings on this album work incredibly well. The contrasts between adjacent songs are stark and the album builds up song after song until 50 minutes in, the finale The Power of One begins. It's a dark album overall and a great one to listen to in the winter.

Honorable mentions:
V by Symphony X

Elysium by Stratovarius

No World Order by Gamma Ray

Unification by Iron Savior

Ecliptica by Sonata Arctica

1. **Sonata Arctica - Ecliptica**"
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","I may just be on a little kick but...

1. Galneryus - Advance to the fall
This album just has everything i could want in a power metal album aside from a medieval sounding sing along of course lol. Very melodey and keyboard reliant while still maintaining that aggressive edge. PLus yama B's singing is always top notch just a classic.
2. Blind Guardian - Somewhere Far Beyond
Nothing else i can realy say about this album that hasn't already been said here. Probably my most listened to album of all time.
3. Theocracy - Self Titled
Now i will preface this by saying i am not the most religious person, so the themes of Matt's lyrics dont really bother me that much. Considering that he pretty much wrote this himself it is a fantastic album. The choruses are always in my head for days after i listen to it. The small imperfections that the recordings give it a nice charm to it aswell. With the remastered version with real drums out now my love has only grown."
"What are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?","**3rd place: Fairyland - Score to a New Beginning**
Fairyland's final album is better than their previous two put together. It's one of those albums I usually want to listen all the way through rather than listening to separate tracks randomly. It's got a very impressive line-up with like 7 guest vocalists, genius musical composition, super-uplifting melodies and symphonic elements. The title track is so good it's unreal, it's so uplifting and so incredibly fantastic. Assault on the Shore is equally fantastic, and most of the rest of the tracks are great.

**2nd place: Masterplan - Aeronautics**  
Jørn Lande is my favorite vocalist, ever. The guy is so incredibly talented and is just the king of metal. Everything he touches turns into gold. Aeronautics is pure gold, tons of kick-ass tracks.

**1st place: Heavenly - Virus**  
This album is the epitome of power metal, imo. The opening song (The Dark Memories) is just insane and is pretty much my favorite song ever, in any genre. It's got the catchy Spill Blood on Fire and the super badass title track. The first 8 tracks are top-tier stuff, most consistent album I've ever listened to."

*****  
###The Wicked Symphony (2010)  
In 2010, Avantasia went and did something awesome: They released two albums simultaneously. Both albums are continuations of the fictional plot of *The Scarecrow*, and the three albums are often referred to as ""The Wicked Trilogy"". *The Wicked Symphony* is part two of this trilogy.

**Returning guest vocalists**: Jørn Lande, Michael Kiske, André Matos, Bob Catley, and Ralf Zdiarstek.  
**New guest vocalists**: Russel Allen, Klaus Meine, Tim ""Ripper"" Owens.

The album is appropriately opened with ""**The Wicked Symphony**"". And if you have not heard this song yet, you'll need to tighten your belt because this song will blow your pants off. The intro is a cinematic score, which immediately gives you epic vibes and builds up your expectations for the rest of the song. It might be because I have listened to this song *at least* a hundred times, but the intro makes so much sense and the climax comes at a very appropriate point, after which the drums and guitars kick in with a very nice melodic segment. Tobias Sammet opens the first verse, with 8 fantastic lines. Then Russel Allen takes over with four soaring lines, and finally Jorn finishes the last 4 lines of the verse. They sing the chorus in unison, and it's fantastic. The second verse follows the same structure, only Jorn and Sammet switch parts. After the second run of the chorus, we have an awesome guitar solo that *just makes so much sense* with the rest of the song. After it is done, Sammet does some irregular screams while a cool rhythm is running, and the two slowly merge to something more sensible and the result will send chills down your spine. Cue a short guitar solo, followed by a great bridge back to the chorus, which runs one last time. After that, the song comes to an end. I know I don't usually get this fanboyish, but this song is just perfect. I kept saying that the song *made sense*, and it does - it's such a well crafted song. The icing on the cake is the fact that all three of my favorite vocalists are teaming up in this song. They will forever be the holy trinity of my power metal heart, and their gathering has only happened once and will probably never happen again. This track is the holy grail to the religion that is power metal.

How can the rest of the album live up to such a masterpiece of an opening? Well, it can't. The next track is ""Wastelands"", featuring Kiske in what is a generally forgettable song. The song has good guitar work, but the vocals are average by Avantasia standards, and I get reminded how quickly Kiske's vibrato gets old. Track 3 is ""Scales of Justice"" with Tim ""Ripper"" Owens. The song itself is decent, but man, Owens' voice is downright unpleasant. It's not unclean, but not clean either. He sings high-pitched notes, and the results make me cringe.

Then we get to the poppy song of the album, ""**Dying for an Angel**"" (sorry, /u/MadTheMad). This song is to Avantasia what ""Spill Blood on Fire"" is to Heavenly: An incredibly catchy song that, despite not being a powerful song at all, definitely deserves a listen. This track features Klaus Meine of Scorpions, whose voice is very different from Sammet's. That allows for very dynamic verses. It is probably the least significant song that I added to the playlist, but I do think that anyone that are into Avantasia should listen to this song. It might be too poppy for you, but if you can appreciate song recommendations based purely on catchiness, this one just might stick in your mind.

""Blizzard on a Broken Mirror"" is another forgettable track. I don't really have much to say about it. The chorus is pretty bad. Let's just move on to ""Runaway Train"", which features Kiske, Jorn, and Bob Catley. The song starts out like a ballad, but gains some momentum after a minute or so. Out of the four vocalists, I'd say Sammet sounds best in this one. It's a decent power metal ballad. ""Crestfallen"" has some kind of abstract, pop-like vibe. Sammet's performance on the first verse is decent, but the chorus makes my ears hurt. Jorn does a good job on the second verse, but even Jorn can't save this song. ""Forever is a Long Time"" is a much more pleasant song that better utilizes Jorn's powerful voice. The instrumentation here is pretty bland, but Jorn and Sammet's vocals make it an enjoyable track nonetheless.

Ralf Zdiarstek returns in ""Black Wings"", but the song is too slow to let him pull any of those amazing vocals he did in *The Metal Opera*. A forgettable track, to put it mildly. Things get better with ""States of Matter"", featuring Russel Allen. The faster tempo is welcome after the bulk of the album being generally slow. Allen sounds fantastic as always, as does Sammet. One of the more enjoyable tracks on the album. The album is closed with ballad-like ""The Edge"".

*****  
###Angel of Babylon (2010)  
The third and final part of the Scarecrow trilogy. It is also, in my opinion, the weakest album of the bunch. Not a single playlist addition here.

**Returning guest vocalists**: Jørn Lande, Michael Kiske, Oliver Hartmann, Bob Catley.  
**New guest vocalists**: Russel Allen, Jon Oliva, Cloudy Yang

This album opens with ""Stargazers"", featuring Jorn, Allen, and Kiske. Initially, the song sounds very promising. When you compare this song to ""The Wicked Symphony"", ""Stargazers"" simply does not deliver. The intro sounds promising indeed, with Sammet, Jorn and Allen doing some lines each. Kiske doesn't until the first verse. The instrumentation has a fast tempo, but is a little lacking in melody. The main attraction here is the vocals, and all four vocalists are excellent. Some extra props should go to Allen, he sounds absolutely magnificent in this track, especially between 4:35 - 5:05. The chorus is forgettable by Avantasia standards, and while it is definitely a strong track in its own right, it lacks an overall memorability. ""Angel of Babylon"", featuring only Jorn this time, is very similar in vibe to ""Forever is a Long Time"" on *The Wicked Symphony*: The dynamic duo of Sammet and Jorn delivers another enjoyable track, average in instrumentation but with fantastic vocals and a feel-good vibe overall. The third track of the album is ""Your Love is Evil"", which is soloed by Sammet. It's slower, with steady drums and little guitar work. From a different perspective, you could say there's no distractions from the vocals, and Sammet does not disappoint here. Another enjoyable track.

Then we get to a weird ass song. ""Death is Just a Feeling"" is a creepy-vibe song fronted by Jon Oliva. Like with ""Scales of Justice"" on *The Wicked Symphony*, the the voice keeps the song from being enjoyable, at least to me.  
The album takes a turn for the better again with ""Rat Race"", again featuring Jorn. The tempo is faster again, and this song actually seems some decent guitar work backing up the vocals. Jorn kicks off the first verse, and Sammet does the second half of the first verse. Sammet solos the chorus this time around, and it's a grabbing one. The second verse is sung solely by Sammet, as well. After the second run of the chorus, at 2:55 we get one of the best guitar solos on the album.

The rest of the album remains forgettable. ""Promised Land"", originally featured on the *Lost in Space* EP, is somewhat of a remedy to the otherwise weak second half. Besides that, they're all more or less forgettable. ""Down in the Dark"" is a slow track featuring Jorn, which honestly bores me. ""Blowing Out the Flame"" is a boring ballad, something I feel that Avantasia does way too often. Things get weird in ""Symphony of Life"". A creepy synthesizer intro, and vocals by female guest vocalist Cloudy Yang. Sammet doesn't participate in this song. The vocals are okay, but the song is very out of place with the rest of the album, hell, the whole trilogy, hell, the whole discography!

""Alone I Remember"" has a decent acoustic guitar intro, and Jorn makes yet another appearance. It's yet another slow-paced song, however, and while the vocals are great as per usual, it just simply isn't memorable. If you didn't have enough ballads yet, the album ends with one: ""Journey to Arcadia"", with Allen and Bob Catley. Dammit, I'm tired of these ballads!

*****  
###The Mystery of Time (2013)  
ALLRIGHT KIDS, it's time for **Avantasia's best album**!!!! In terms of style, *The Mystery of Time* hits a middle point between *The Metal Opera* and *The Scarecrow*. The album is more speed-based overall than the previous three albums, which is a welcome change.

**Returning guest vocalists**: Michael Kiske, Bob Catley, Cloudy Yang.  
**New guest vocalists**: Joe Lynn Turner, Biff Bayford, Ronnie Atkins, Eric Martin.

This album starts off much in the same vein as *The Wicked Symphony*. ""Spectres"" pretty much follows the structure of ""The Wicked Symphony"", with a cinematic score building up the song, followed by a melodic kickoff. Whereas the verses are largely different, the chorus is very similar. Sammet is supported by Turner here. This song is also much shorter than ""The Wicked Symphony"", clocking in *only 6 minutes*. It's a great start of the album, to say the least. However, it doesn't knock my pants off like ""The Wicked Symphony"" does.

The high quality is maintained in ""**The Watchmaker's Dream**"". This is one of Avantasia's more cheerful songs, in vibe and melody at least. The intro riff is deliciously energetic and positive. This is Turner's time to shine, with an absolutely fantastic first verse. The instrumentation during the first verse is almost non-existent, which only amplifies the magnificence of the powerful lines Turner is dishing out. After a fantastic ""oooh nooo"", the chorus hits you, and it hits hard. At first it may sound like a chorus build up, but it's actually the chorus itself. Because of, or despite that fact, the chorus is absolutely gripping and amazing. For the second verse, Sammet delivers a crushing first line, after which Turner finishes the second verse. However, Sammet does the chorus this time, and it's awesome. After that, an amazing guitar solo makes its entrance, and it fits perfectly with the pace and vibe of the song. Finally, the chorus returns for a full third time, and it phases out with a fourth run.

""Black Orchid"" takes on a slower pace, with a symphonic intro. Biff Byford makes his first guest appearance for Avantasia here, and he definitely sounds good. The verses are great, the chorus less so. Honestly, though, this is one of the most forgettable tracks on the album. ""Where Clock Hands Freeze"" is probably the Avantasia song in which Kiske sounds best, in what is a pretty standard Avantasia song. Definite check-out recommendation from me.

Then we have ""Sleepwalking"", the song that spearheaded the promotion of the album. Which is baffling, to say the least, because this is a pop song. At the time, it definitely turned me off and lowered my expectations for the album greatly. The song attempts very hard to be dramatic, but that kinda works against it. Both Sammet and Yang's vocals are commendable, but this song just simply isn't good.

""Savior in the Clockwork"" sounds like an album opener, with a cinematic intro. It's the longest song on the album, and features Kiske, Turner, and Byford. The pace is nicely fast-ish, and the instrumentation is decent enough. The main attraction, as usual, is the vocals. I'm 90% sure Turner solos the first verse, sounding good doing so. Sammet spearheads the chorus, and it sounds pretty awesome. The second verse is soloed by Sammet, sounds awesome as usual. After the second run of the chorus, we hear Byford in the bridge leading into some nifty guitar riffs. I don't really hear Kiske in the mix, though... o_O

Next up is ""**Invoke the Machine**"", which is filled to the brim with energy, intensity and awesomeness! The song immediately kicks you in the nuts with the sickest guitar solo Avantasia has ever put out. Holy fucking shit, that's all I have to say. Sammet delivers some excellent lines, followed by Ronnie Atkins delivering equally excellent lines with his rough-y voice. The fast pace is maintained also in the chorus, making the song sound wholesome and intense throughout. The chorus is decent enough, but the verses are where it's at. The sick intro riff returns after the chorus, which is a good choice. I have no clue who does the first lines of verse 2. Roy Khan? Idk. Sources only cite Ronnie Atkins, but it sounds nothing like his other lines. Maybe he simply switches vocal styles. The guitar solo towards the end of the track is cool enough, but it doesn't come close to the intro riff, honestly.

It's not an Avantasia album without a ballad. ""What's Left of Me"" takes care of business. This is Eric Martin's only appearance for Avantasia. Too bad for him that he was featured on a forgettable ballad. The Kiske man kicks it up a notch in ""Dweller in a Dream"", returning to the fast pace we all know and love. This song goes to show that Sammet and Kiske *can* be a deadly duo. The album closes with ballad-like ""The Great Mystery"", being supported by Catley, Turner, and Byford. The song is 10 minutes long. I can't recommend a 10-minute long ballad. I just can't. The song does see some heavier segments, but only slightly, and they're few and far between. I bet that it's an appropriate album closer from an artistic viewpoint. But all I want is some power meturls, dammit!

*****  
###Conclusion  
**TL;DR**: Check out ""The Wicked Symphony"", ""Dying for an Angel"", ""The Watchmaker's Dream"", and ""Invoke the Machine"".

*The Scarecrow* was finished off with two albums with some great songs in between but with far too many ballads. I'm not afraid to call *The Mystery of Time* the best album Avantasia has put out."
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 2: 2010 - 2013)","I do really like your writeups, and while it all comes down to subjectivity in the end, I feel like I need to try and tear this one apart because I really love this era of Avantasia

&gt; In 2010, Avantasia went and did something awesome: They released two albums simultaneously. 

I will agree this is awesome. In fact, Tobi proudly touted the fact that there were no boring interludes or tracks with silence (though I think he missed the intro on ""The Wicked Symphony""; not that it's boring, but more that it's sort of a bombastic intro)

&gt; ""Blizzard on a Broken Mirror"" is another forgettable track

I would argue there's not a single forgettable track on any of these three albums, but this is one of the best. Give it another shot.

&gt; The album is closed with ballad-like ""The Edge"".

This write-up doesn't do this song justice. It is easily one of the best Avantasia songs ever, and shows how incredible of a singer Tobi is. This is possibly my favourite song from the album (though other than ""Crestfallen"", they're all pretty much perfect.

&gt; This album opens with ""Stargazers"", featuring Jorn, Allen, and Kiske. Initially, the song sounds very promising. When you compare this song to ""The Wicked Symphony"", ""Stargazers"" simply does not deliver.

This track is every bit as good as ""The Wicked Symphony"". Not sure if you've seen the band live, but this song absolutely kills live. It definitely improved my appreciation of the song.

&gt; Then we get to a weird ass song. ""Death is Just a Feeling"" is a creepy-vibe song fronted by Jon Oliva. Like with ""Scales of Justice"" on The Wicked Symphony, the the voice keeps the song from being enjoyable, at least to me.

Time to buy some Savatage albums ;) Jon Oliva is a god!

&gt; If you didn't have enough ballads yet, the album ends with one: ""Journey to Arcadia"", with Allen and Bob Catley. Dammit, I'm tired of these ballads!

I sympathize with the ballads comment, and I do agree that the second half of Angel of Babylon drags a bit, but ""Journey To Arcadia"" is one of the stronger tracks on the record. Really classic stuff, especially Bob Catley's performance.

&gt; ALLRIGHT KIDS, it's time for Avantasia's best album!!!

Close, but it's not The Scarecrow :P

&gt; Then we have ""Sleepwalking"", the song that spearheaded the promotion of the album.

This is only partially true. Although it is the ""single"" from the record, ""Invoke The Machine"" was the first song available to hear from the record.

&gt; Which is baffling, to say the least, because this is a pop song. At the time, it definitely turned me off and lowered my expectations for the album greatly. The song attempts very hard to be dramatic, but that kinda works against it. Both Sammet and Yang's vocals are commendable, but this song just simply isn't good.

This one is a tough one. I'm at the point where I think Tobi genuinely likes messing with his fans and putting songs like this (and ""What Kind of Love"") on his albums. For what it's worth, I think this isn't as good as some of his other songs in this vein, although I do like it a lot. I have no problem with anyone hating this song though.

&gt; It's not an Avantasia album without a ballad. ""What's Left of Me"" takes care of business. This is Eric Martin's only appearance for Avantasia. Too bad for him that he was featured on a forgettable ballad. 

At this point it looks like every song is my ""favourite"" song, but ""What's Left Of Me"" is again, easily one of my favourite Avantasia tracks. Eric Martin absolutely kills it here. 

&gt; The album closes with ballad-like ""The Great Mystery"", being supported by Catley, Turner, and Byford. The song is 10 minutes long. I can't recommend a 10-minute long ballad. I just can't. The song does see some heavier segments, but only slightly, and they're few and far between. I bet that it's an appropriate album closer from an artistic viewpoint.

This song is a completely epic masterpiece. It's an appropriate close to an insanely monolithic record. I really dig it.

&gt; But all I want is some power meturls, dammit!

I think this is where our differences lie. I will fully admit that power metal Tobi is best (particularly in Edguy), but you have to appreciate that he's just not at that point in his career anymore. "
"Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 2: 2010 - 2013)","Great reply, bro!

Yeah I guess it comes down to my tastes being pretty narrow (and not favoring ballads much). So by definition I'm probably way more critical than some might say I should be.

I've never seen any power metal band live, actually. I'd like to, but NOBODY I know likes PM in the slightest and I don't feel like going Han Solo style."

I'm not surprised Angel Of Babylon is the worst album. I think it's an absolute massive piece of turd. It's like he wrote Wicked Symphony and then decided it wasn't enough and did another album that basically copies the first one but it sucks. Invoke The Machine is indeed a powerhouse.

"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","[Non-tl;dr version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uBQkAA49kt6NbCeOQc_Wtsy5rpS1O8x3Fa-dIrobFh4/edit?usp=sharing)

**Iron Savior, tl;dr version**

In the power metal circles I've been a part of, Iron Savior is generally acknowledged but isn't one of the top bands that people talk about. They don't have the musical variety of a band like Sonata Arctica or Stratovarius, but they do what they do extremely well.

Iron Savior's initial claim to fame was having both Thomen Stauch and Mr. Power Metal, Kai Hansen in their lineup. This was rounded out by Hansen's childhood friend Piet Sielck on vocals and guitars. Both Hansen and Stauch later left the band, but Sielck carried on with new people. He was previously involved with the production on some Gamma Ray and Blind Guardian albums.

The band's music is centered around the sentient spaceship known as the Iron Savior. The idea for this came from a sci-fi book that Sielck had been writing, and the band has written four concept albums around it. This story has mostly been dropped since then, but the ship still graces the band's album covers and makes an appearance on one or two songs every time.
**[Iron Savior (1997)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvNazUnle2rRRaVJzBlc6oHZOFNxJcbt9)**

*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, bass, vocals), Kai Hansen (guitar, vocals), Thomen Stauch (drums)*

Like many bands' first album, Iron Savior's debut album is a little rough around the edges-production wise. They hadn't found their sound yet; you can really hear the Judas Priest influence in some places. It's a solid album but their weakest in my opinion. It's not as cohesive as an album as some of their future albums, but there are some very good songs nonetheless.

*Notable songs from this album:*

[Atlantis Falling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PseK0lgnT4) - This song gets right to the point, introducing both the story and the band's musical style. It's slightly faster than midtempo, and has a great main riff. A good headbanging song.

[Children of the Wasteland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8dEZWGBpRk) - My personal favorite off this album. It's another solid midtempo song, with a pretty awesome solo. Sielck likes to include these small interludes in a lot of his songs that could almost be their own song. 2:54 is the first of these and there are many more in future albums.

[Watcher in the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlZ7ZbKxzV4) - The first song with Kai Hansen singing. He wrote this one and it is also on Gamma Ray's album Somewhere Out in Space. Hansen's vocals are pretty similar to his singing in Gamma Ray. Sielck also sings a verse, which is pretty cool. Songs where both of them sing are among my favorites.

**[Unification (1999)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvNazUnle2rRhHynE684f1PX3nVWGlVXW)**

*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Kai Hansen (guitar, vocals), Jan Eckert (bass, vocals), Andreas Kück (keyboards), Dan Zimmermann (drums)*

Iron Savior's sound really shines on this album. They added bassist Jan Eckert and keyboardist Andreas Kück, who mostly adds to the general atmosphere of the music. Thomen Stauch was also traded out for Dan Zimmermann from Gamma Ray. The tone is much better and the sound is a lot fuller. Unfortunately the full album isn't on Youtube, but if you can get your hands on it I recommend listening to it front to back. It is a very cohesive album and the band creates the sci-fi atmosphere really, really well. 

*Notable songs*

[Coming Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_cVxEiMdzk) is one of Iron Savior's most famous songs. It exemplifies their style and is a good song for people new to the band. It's got one of those choruses you can't help but sing along to.

[Forevermore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeYz4xJ8ors) isn't a song you would probably come across if you were looking for Iron Savior music on Youtube. It's a slow song, every metal album has to have one right? But this one has Kai singing, and has some amazing vocal harmonies. I highly recommend it.

[Gorgar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3wRYbVkz1o) - Did you know Piet Sielck was in an early incarnation of Helloween? He contributed to some of the early songs.

**[Dark Assault(2001)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvNazUnle2rThhGjAnA31tg91yjbxQi0U)**

*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Kai Hansen (guitar, vocals), Joachim Küstner (guitar, backing vocals), Jan Eckert (bass, vocals), Andreas Kück (keyboard), Thomas Nack (drums)*

The band added guitarist Joachim Küstner for this album. He has only one solo on this album, but really shines in the future. They also traded out Dan Zimmermann for Thomas Nack, who did drums on one Gamma Ray album. Stylistically, this is pretty similar to Unification. The songs again work together well as a cohesive unit, and build up both the atmosphere and the storyline. Again they are a mix of mid-tempo and uptempo, though this album is overall a bit faster than the last one. I also couldn't find videos for all the songs on YouTube, which is a shame because this album is another incredible one to sit down and listen to. 

*Notable songs*

[Solar Wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pRnbrUomCs) has some of Kai Hansen's harshest vocals with the band. This is one of the first songs that doesn't necessarily have to do with the story, though stylistically it is of course pretty similar.

[Predators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIjblIRLGLA) has Hansen and Sielck singing back-to-back, alternating lines throughout the verses, it's really cool. This is another ""let's go kick some alien ass"" song. This is Küstner's time to shine; the solo on this song is 100% him.

I couldn't find a video of **Made of Metal**, but it is one of my favorite songs off this album. It is a slightly slower song about the Savior lamenting what it has done. It has found peace with itself and is returning to Earth.

[Back into the Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaj4lKxYFm4) is my favorite song from this album. I think it needs to be listened to after the rest of the album to really feel its impact, but it is still good on its own. It is a good (half of the) climax/resolution to the album and you can feel the tension.

Songs I couldn't find a video for:
Made of Metal
After the War has a verse sung by Jan Eckert and serves as the other half of the resolution.

**[Condition Red(2002)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFD636A5B98B6090C)**

*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Joachim Küstner (guitar, backing vocals), Jan Eckert (bass, vocals), Andreas Kück (keyboard), Thomas Nack (drums)*

Kai Hansen dropped out after the last album. Thankfully, the only thing missing is his vocals and his small contributions to songwriting. I have heard many people say this is their favorite Iron Savior album, and with good reason. Once again, it is a very, very good complete-sounding concept album. At this point you might say Iron Savior is predictable and doesn't have a lot of variety, and you're probably mostly right. But they do it so beautifully that it might not even matter.

*Notable songs*

[Mindfeeder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj9KDp1bjQw) (my personal favorite) is one of the most badass songs by a band that does almost nothing but badass songs. It is about the bad guy, Randor CulDranoc and his return to take revenge on those who wronged him. 

[Paradise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9yewsdsveI) is a send-off for both the album, and the story. It is more appreciated by listening to the full album. The Savior has reaffirmed its mission to protect Earth, and sees off a crew that is sailing for new worlds.

**[Thunderbird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFyKGt8iCeQ) has the single greatest intro I have ever heard in a song, ever. If you listen to nothing else in this guide please for the love of god listen to the first minute.** 

This album also has an interesting cover of Crazy, by Seal. I think the original is better but it's still interesting to listen to.

**[Battering Ram(2004)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL37E7371ABE933FFB)**

*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Joachim Küstner (guitar, backing vocals), Yenz Leonhardt (bass), Thomas Nack (drums)*

On this album Iron Savior is a little more straight-up heavy metal. The title track opens up the album and isn't super fast like the last 2 openers. The full sound is still there, but without the keyboards. They brought in Yenz Leonhardt (Stormwarrior) to replace Jan Eckert and his sound is a little different. He gets to shine every once in a while. 

*Notable songs*

[Riding Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUQwBt8q5LM) is probably Iron Savior's fastest song post-concept albums. It is has another one of the interludes that could possibly be expanded on to be its own song at 4:10.

[Machine World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XwH-65DgUM) didn't get put in that playlist for some reason. It's slow, but heavy, and is part of the story.

[Living on a Fault Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYfK2noxzgA) is the single most depressing song Iron Savior has written. It's slow, and it's different from anything Iron Savior has done. Highly, highly recommended.

**[Megatropolis (2007)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL36B8070A96789101)**

*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Joachim Küstner (guitar, backing vocals), Yenz Leonhardt (bass), Thomas Nack (drums)*

Despite dropping the story for the most part, Iron Savior has continued the sci-fi theme. On this album they also dropped the guitars to C#, a first for the band. Sielck's voice is a little harsher, for lack of a better word, on this album. The new guitar-centric sound continues on this album and it has a thick, full sound. Finally, the bass is brought up a little bit too which is great. The band also has a more mature, slightly darker sound here. This is likely in part due to the death of Sielck's brother in 2005, to whom the album is dedicated. It is a good album but I like a few of their other ones better.

*Notable songs*

[Megatropolis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tiE3fNavWw) (my personal favorite) sums up the new style well. The vocals are a little bit lower, the song is a little bit darker, and everything's tuned down to C#. The song is about one of the adventurers on the Thunderbird, returned to his home in Megatropolis.

[Cybernetic Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLm69KLTnZg) is slow and dark. The bass's muddy tone is really, really good on this one.

A really interesting bonus track on this album is [Iron Watcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iRmxqdqI38), a combination of the songs Iron Savior and Watcher in the Sky. 

**[The Landing (2011)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6F65D2A98B8FC5D6)**

*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Joachim Küstner (guitar, backing vocals), **Jan Eckert (bass, backing vocals)**, Thomas Nack (drums)*

The separate intro track returns after a long absence, and it leads into the majestic [The Savior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj5oEXMTW38). The heavier guitar-centric sound continues on this album, and it is a return to the lighter sound/tone after Megatropolis. 

*Notable songs*

[Hall of the Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbNhdaVdO2E) is a slightly slower song. It is sort of unique in that it tells a story of its own, supported by no other songs. Highly recommended.

[R. U. Ready](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD7WOQqNQxc) is an homage to the music and bands that inspired Iron Savior.

The single most interesting part of this album to me is the cover of Underworld's [Underneath the Radar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ-IdrKsXdo). It is a completely different style from the original, but it works very well. 

**[Rise of the Hero (2014)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7L6Yv9k_sc)**

*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Joachim Küstner (guitar, backing vocals), Jan Eckert (bass, backing vocals), Thomas Nack (drums)*

Stylistically this is a very similar album to the previous one, and is good but not quite as good as The Landing in my opinion. The band uses D tuning again, probably because that's also what they use when they play live. This album also shows a little bit more variety in the songs, with another out-of-genre cover of Dance with Somebody.

*Notable songs*

**Iron Warrior** (my personal favorite) is a pretty standard song musically, but that chorus is just great. I sing along with it almost every time I listen to it.

**Dragon King** is Iron Savior's second standalone story song. Like the last one it's a little slower, and very good.

**The Demon** is this album's slow song. It's very somber, similar to Before the Pain on the last album. This one has a harsh, sad chorus though. 

**My personal favorite song from each album:**

Iron Savior: Children of the Wasteland

Unification: Eye to Eye

Dark Assault: Back Into the Light

Condition Red: Mindfeeder

Battering Ram: Starchaser

Megatropolis: Megatropolis

The Landing: Underneath the Radar

Rise of the Hero: Iron Warrior

Album overall: Dark Assault, because I got it at an important time in my life. The most popular choice for this is usually Unification or Condition Red."
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","Unification and Battering Ram are my two favorites. Great write up as well, these types of posts are always a great read"
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","Glad you like it. I'm a huge fan of Iron Savior and wanted to contribute to the sub."
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","You've missed two great songs from Condition Red:

[Titans of our Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FbY5vcsams)

[Tales of the Bold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AgVKZlFsw)

I have that feeling that this band is the most overlooked power metal band. It's like everyone know this band, but no one is ever talking about them.

Thanks for reminder of this band. Cheers!"
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","Thanks! I had to trim down a lot to get it to fit in reddit's character count. It's about half the size it was originally."
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","[deleted]"
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","This is a really awesome guide! I agree that Iron Savior is a band everyone knows, but nobody talks about. To be fair, I think a large part of that is distribution. Their distribution in North America is very poor. For that reason, the only album of theirs I have is Condition Red, but I love it. Surprisingly, everything else I've heard from the band hasn't really caught my attention, but that album is a masterpiece for me. I am still trying to seek out their other records because I'd probably like them if I put some time into listening to them."
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","Glad you like it, I absolutely agree. Their albums aren't even always on Amazon. "
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","Even Spotify barely has any stuff.  Megalopolis and Rise of the Hero are, I think, their only albums on there.  I haven't checked lately."
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","Iron Savior is my go-to band when I just need hours and hours of solid power metal that just keeps chugging along. Such a good band!"
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","The non-tl;dr version will be getting posted on Google Docs shortly and I'll add it into the main post."
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","[My personal favorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bcDc35Fmjk)"
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","Good guide, Batter Ram is a great album. I wish they had some faster stuff though, saying that, here's a corking thigh banger I like; [Break The Curse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI9nUPbfyYE)"
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","Glad you like it. The fast songs have certainly not been as common on recent albums. Starlight on The Landing and Firestorm (I think) on Rise of the Hero are the only recent ones."
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","No mention for [H.M. Powered Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RznSoEIT6IU&amp;index=8&amp;list=PL37E7371ABE933FFB)?  It's cheesy as hell, as most metal songs about metal tend to be, but damn if it isn't fun.

Thanks for the guide though.  Iron Savior's always been one of those bands on the edge of my perception since a few tracks off Battering Ram and Megalopolis showed up on Pandora one day.  "
"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","Yeah, I agree that their songs about metal are a cheesy but both of them are really good."

"A Guide/Analysis of Iron Savior","I'll just stick with Battering Ram thanks :) Not a fan of any other albums despite many attempts."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","It's that time of year again. Namely the end of it. With not much on my radar before 2015, here's a brief look at Chapter 2014 in the Book of Power Metal as I saw it:

----

**The Amazing**

Freedom Call - Beyond

Sonata Arctica - Pariah's Child

Gamma Ray - Empire of the Undead

Edguy - Space Police: Defenders of the Crown

Elvenking - The Pagan Manifesto

Sabaton - Heroes

Falconer - Black Moon Rising

Alestorm - Sunset on the Golden Age

Unisonic - Light of Dawn

----

**The Good**

Primal Fear - Delivering the Black

Winterstorm - Cathyron

Battleroar - Blood of Legends

Twilight Force - Tales of Ancient Prophecies

Derdian - Human Reset

DragonForce - Maximum Overload

HammerFall - (r)Evolution

Neonfly - Strangers in Paradise

----

**The Not Bad**

Iced Earth - Plagues of Babylon

Persuader - The Fiction Maze

Iron Savior - Rise of the Hero

Brainstorm - Firesoul

Crystal Eyes - Killer

Astral Doors - Notes from the Shadows

Bloodbound - Stormborn

----

**The Ugly**

Timo Tolkki's Avalon - Angels of the Apocalypse

Machinae Supremacy - Phantom Shadow

----


**Quick Summary**

This year has been a *very* good quality year for power metal. It's central theme has been bands returning to form and improving upon their last release. Freedom Call and HammerFall back to roots with more focus on good old cheesy power metal, Sonata in places back to a pre-Unia sound, Edguy somewhat coming out of the hard rock phase, Gamma Ray improving on To The Metal, Alestorm showing they're far from running dry, Unisonic delivering the power metal we all wanted, beautiful magic from Elvenking and Primal Fear delivering a classic. Not to mention more good stuff from DragonForce with Marc, solid stuff from Sabaton, more decent stuff from Derdian and a some promising potential from Neonfly.

----

**Snake_Byte's 2014 Album of the Year**: Falconer - Black Moon Rising

After such strong competition this year this was a very hard choice but at the end of the day I had to go with something consistently joyful to listen to, where every song brings a smile. This is one of those ""I have to listen to it all in one go"" albums. It's damn near-flawless and such a big improvement on Armod. It's ballsy, it's atmospheric, it's heavy, it's gentle, it's folk-y, it's shred-y, it's melodic, it's intricate, it's got narrative, it's got Mathias showcasing his best and everyone playing out of their skin. A firm Falconer classic and no mistake. 

----

**Snake_Byte's 2014 Biggest Disappointment of the Year**: Iron Savior - Rise of the Hero

I was SO close to saying Timo Tolkki's Avalon - Angels of the Apocalypse but you know what that's just bad without surprise. Whereas with Iron Savior I really expected something more than this after enjoying The Landing so damn much. I love Piet Sielck and even though Iron Savior have a tendency to sound samey, this just feels so generic compared to The Landing. It's not a bad album, not by far, it's very listenable it just lacks originality and sounds like it could've been spat out in a week."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","I pretty much agree with this entire list. Falconer and Freedom Call are probably my #2 and #3/4 of the year.

Noble Beast's self-titled ended up being #1 for me."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Noble Beast really surprised me! Glad I bought their album."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Looks like I really gotta check them out"
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","&gt; Alestorm showing they're far from running dry

Well... when the time comes to write album [five], you know they'll scrape the barrel once more."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","I was actually listening to scraping the barrel on the way to work this morning and chuckled, because they did exactly what they said they would. (And it was pretty good in the end!)"
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","For me, an Alestorm album should be just what it was: goofy pirate-and-alcohol-themed lyrics with kickass music behind them.

That said, they should be able to scrape that barrel over and over again (and I hope they do for a long time)."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Thanks for putting Heroes up there.

Some people dismiss it, but I think it's brilliant, one of Sabaton's best (better than Carolus Rex, imo)."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","I got a lot of love for CR and I like that they went in a different direction with that  so Hereos doesn't quite budge that for me. Feels like a small step back by comparison. But the songs are catchy and glorious all the same."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Yeah, I see why people like CR so much, but for some reason CR doesn't resonate with me like Heroes does.

To each his own, we all have different tastes."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","IMO, Carolus Rex is held back a bit by being a concept album, they didn't have the freedom they had on Heroes. Both are great albums though. "
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Thanks for that. I'm a long time fan of bands like Gamma Ray, Edguy, Hammerfall and more on your list. You have just given me plenty of recommendations to enjoy over Christmas!"
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Happy Metal Christmas!"
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","If I made one of these my choices would look so hipsterish..."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Don't worry, it's the same with my list. I'll post it closer to the end of the year, but it's incredibly *out there*."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","It's more that I can only listen to a subset of stuff since I don't listen to music all day every day, so I focus on stuff that people may not be as familiar with to try and find something new that I like. In my case I specifically looked at basically every PM band originating from Canada over the past year/year and a half (I'm Canadian, so might as well). Maybe I'll do the same with another country soon.

Or to put it in a simpler manner, I kind of know what bands I do and don't like of the big bands. Might as well see what new stuff is being done."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Considered leaving out the heavy hitters and mention some lesser knowns but that doesn't encapsulate 2014 in power metal as fully. Then it wouldn't provide much of a service or talking-point to the sub at large I guess.

What were your highlights? You should do a list"
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Eh maybe I'll do one at some point but I'd preface it with something like ""I have a pretty narrow view here so if your favorite band isn't on here it doesn't mean I don't like them, it just means I didn't listen to them a lot this year""

That's not to say what I talk about would suck...just that I might recommend stuff that everyone didn't listen to."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Good list man, some albums on your list that I didn't even know were out, gonna have to check them out. "
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Thanks! Left out plenty too, it's been a good year!"
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","The pagan manifesto was a pleasant surprise for me. Thoroughly enjoyed that album. "
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Ah, that time of the year again. Freedom Call marginally missed being my # 1 this year, I'll post my list in 20 days in case something changes (like a new album being released that blows me away, even though I doubt it). "
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","I wish crystal eyes kept the vocalist they had on Chained. I really liked the sound of that album. "
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","I think Stormborn and Rise Of The Hero should be put into the ""good"" personally."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Hard to argue with that list. I may have one or two switch from the Amazing and Good spots (Primal Fear and Edguy come to mind), but otherwise it looks good to me."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Someone else liked  Pariah's Child?"
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","There was nothing particularly wrong with the album (cept the mastering apparently).

Wasn't perfect. Was pretty darn good and went in a good direction compared to their previous stuff. Blood was the best song they've recorded in years."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","I totally agree with your list, except one small thing

I really liked Machinae Supremacy's album this year, yes, its not perfect, and in my opinion, Overworld is by far my favorite of theirs, but i wouldn't go as far as to call it one of the worst...

I would put it in ""The Not Bad""....its not amazing, but its a great listen in my opinion"
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","That's a fair call i only gave it a couple of listens "
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","glad to see elvenking and derdian get some recognition.  I didnt know either of these bands were popular.  (or in the case of elvenking popular anymore).  I didnt know some of these bands had albums coming out this year, will have to check them out, thanks for this great list.

So far for my dragonforce has been keeping me on repeat the most with three hammers and symphony of the night."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","2014 offered up so much tasty metal. Cheers and enjoy!"
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","There's a distinct lack of Noble Beast and Disforia in this list."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Disforia's The Age of Ether was probably my favorite album. Getting Hansi Kursch to do guest vocals was also brilliant on their part."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Hum, the year is not even over. Won't there be any more 2014 releases??"
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","There's really not much. Nothing I'm excited about anyway."
"My 2014 Albums of the Year","Your amazing is my good/not bad!"
"HELLOWEEN - POWER (Vocal Cover)",""
"I made a list of my top albums each year from 1982 onwards.","Hi, I'm new. This took me a while to compile. I'm not sure if it's perfect but it is my list. It's biased and leans heavily towards Blind Guardian and earlier Maiden but it's my list so ner.

Do you like Blind Guardian?"
"I made a list of my top albums each year from 1982 onwards.","Yeah, it's safe to say that I do. But to tell the truth, those years don't seem to have much to compete."
"I made a list of my top albums each year from 1982 onwards.","I know we're mostly just power metal fans here but here's some of the competition for reference for those years.  I'm assuming other genres are ok since you have non-PM on your list:   
   
1989 - Running Wild - Death and Glory, Savatage - Gutter Ballet, Helstar - Nosferatu, Fates Warning - Perfect Symmetry  
  
1992 - Dream Theater - Images and Words, Iron Maiden - Fear of the Dark, Immortal - Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism, Iced Earth - Night of the Stormrider, Darkthrone - A Blaze in the Northern Sky  
  
1995 - Mutha fuckin Land of the Free, Bal-Sagoth - A Black Moon Broods over Lemuria, Death - Symbolic, Virgin Steele - The Marriage of Heaven and Hell part 2
   
1998 - Nightfall runs away with this one for most power metal fans but: Death - Sound of Perseverance, Nightwish - Oceanborn, Rhapsody - Symphony of Enchanted Lands  
  
2002 - Immortal - Sons of Northern Darkness, Agalloch - The Mantle, Symphony X - The Odyssey, Vintersorg - Visions From The Spiral Generator, Threshold - Critical Mass
  
2006 - Dragonland - Astronomy (runaway PM album of the year), Summoning - Oath Bound, Celtic Frost - Monotheist, Iron Maiden - A Matter of Life and Death (bruce still got it, baby), choir of dogs barking christmas songs
  
2010 - Pathfinder - Beyond the Space, Beyond the Time, Sabaton - Coat of Arms.  At the Edge of Time was the best PM album that year.  Non PM - Alcest - Écailles de Lune AoTY for me.  
  
2015 - This year is going to be much stronger than 2010 and Beyond the Red Mirror doesn't have anything as good as Wheel of Time. 

  
"
"I made a list of my top albums each year from 1982 onwards.","Some good stuff on there. Some of the bands on there were in my short list. 

I was stuck on 1989 so just went with BG.

1992 - I had Images and Words and Fear of the Dark on shortlist but went with BG because The Bards Song is probably the greatest thing ever to sing at Wacken.

1995 - Imaginations is my favourite BG album so it was going to win whatever year it was in.

1998 - I was disappointed Rhapsody was this year as I wanted to give them a mention. 

2002 - I defaulted to Night at the Opera because I couldn't really think of anything else at the time.

2006 - I would probably give it to Dragonland but Twist in the Myth holds a special place in my heart because I met my wife when BG were touring that album.

2010 - At the Edge of Time was awesome.

2015 - Not over yet.

"
"I made a list of my top albums each year from 1982 onwards.","Nice to see some Dream Theater love in the PM community. Also, the 8th Sin is amazing; glad to see other people love it. "

"Blind Guardian songs that pertain to Middle-Earth... which ones, and the references, is there a break down out there?","I think there are more, but theses are the ones that I know of. :) the easy ones.

- Nightfall in Middle-Earth [Entire Album]

- The Bard's Song (The Hobbit) [Somewhere Far Beyond]

- By the gates of moria [Battalions of Fear]

"Blind Guardian songs that pertain to Middle-Earth... which ones, and the references, is there a break down out there?","/u/edledhron will be the one you want to ask.

"Blind Guardian songs that pertain to Middle-Earth... which ones, and the references, is there a break down out there?","[deleted]"
"Blind Guardian songs that pertain to Middle-Earth... which ones, and the references, is there a break down out there?","* **Majesty**

The lyrics on this song are fairly open to interpretation. I haven't seen Hansi comment on them himself - I suspect it's about Frodo's journey.

* **Gandalf's Rebirth**

Instrumental - title reference's Eru taking Gandalf out of the world after his death, Gandalf's subsequent enhancement, and the return of Gandalf to the world

* **By the Gates of Moria**

 Instrumental - title references the western bound and entry of Moria

* **Imaginations from the Other Side**

This isn't a song strictly about LotR, but it does have references to it.

* **The Bard's Song**

This will be focused on 'The Hobbit,' but 'In the Forest' also references Tolkien's stories.

This song concerns Bilbo in *The Hobbit.* The first verse, third verse, and chorus describe the various events on the way to the mountain. The second verse concerns Smaug's decension on Erebor and Bilbo taking the Arkenstone from the mountain and the dwarves. The fourth verse concerns Thorin's greed and the potential conflict which would eventually turn into the Battle of Five Armies.

* **Lord of the Rings**

This song is about Frodo's journey along with the rings of power. It's worth noting that there's a misuse of the term 'gnome' here, evidently referring to the dwarves. In Tolkien's work, a 'gnome' is one of the Noldor elves.

* **Nightfall in Middle-earth**

[See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/25iq2m/the_context_of_blind_guardians_nightfall_in/). It should be more than enough, but I'll get around to putting in further context as well as looking at some of the specific lyrics soon.

* **Seize the Day**

This is actually a D&amp;W song, but I thought I would include it here. The song seems to me to be about Frodo's journey, and especially his decision to depart from the Fellowship. Though the line 'The tower knows who you are' confuses me a little as Sauron did not know who Frodo was, and that was actually a rather important point for the plot. Maybe Hansi got influenced by Jackson's films here?"
"Blind Guardian songs that pertain to Middle-Earth... which ones, and the references, is there a break down out there?","""Seize the Day"" is on Touched by the Crimson King, right? The majority of the songs on that album reference Stephen King's Dark Tower series, so I think this song was inspired more by Roland the Gunslinger and his journey in that series (although King himself readily admits that he loved LotR and was inspired to write his own heroic saga after reading Tolkien). There's also a song on that album about Wilde's Dorian. 

Because I'm an avid reader, Blind Guardian will always hold a special place in my heart. I really just want to have tea and talk about books with Hansi; is that so much to ask? :)

Edit: I hadn't seen your post about Nightfall before now, and I just wanted to say that you did an excellent job with your synopsis. Also, thanks for reminding me what a powerful passage the confrontation between Fingolfin and Morgoth is; I reread it since ""Time Stands Still"" is one of my absolute favorite songs, and now I think I need to give the Silmarillion another reread. "
"Blind Guardian songs that pertain to Middle-Earth... which ones, and the references, is there a break down out there?","Jon Schaffer actually talked about 'Seize the Day' being about LotR in one of the interviews he did around the album's release."
"Blind Guardian songs that pertain to Middle-Earth... which ones, and the references, is there a break down out there?","I think every song has already been mentioned in this thread except for Majesty. Also according to Wikipeida, Run For The Night and Lost In The Twilight Hall are LOTR related but there's no direct reference to the books in the lyrics so I can't say for sure. Lastly, there's IFOTS but only just a couple of minor references in that song.

Also while we're on this subject, does anyone find it interesting that (as far as I can tell) BG have not written a single Tolkien related song since NIME? Wonder if it has anything to do with the LOTR movie releases and the books becoming very mainstream. Or perhaps they just exhausted themselves of Tolkien songs after doing an entire album of them. :P

"
"Blind Guardian songs that pertain to Middle-Earth... which ones, and the references, is there a break down out there?","I suspect it's the latter, though D&amp;W did have 'Seize the Day.'

I was sort of hoping that we'd get a few more some day, but it seems that, at least for the time being, Hansi is interested in writing lyrics based on his own stories."

"BABYMETAL go full Power Metal! Road to Resistance Trailer with Sam Totman and Herman Li from Dragonforce on Guitar's","Well, the lead singer wrote the lyrics to this new song, so that's something. But all that you're talking about is behind the scenes stuff. For example, Jani Liimatainen wrote two songs for Stratovarius' latest album, but you would've never known that had you not read the liner notes of *Nemesis*. You would never know that Dave Mustaine wrote tracks for Metallica, Matias Kupiainen wrote songs for Arion, or that Bob Katsionis wrote tracks for Kamelot and Epica, and yet no one cares because at the end of the day it doesn't matter who wrote a song. You can wave the ""*my* music is genuine"" banner as much as you want, but all that really matters is how a song sounds to someone, and if anything else is factored into your judgment of a song/band/album, you're not listening to music for the right reasons."

That's just simply incorrect. If that's all you seek for in music than good for you but I seek way more in music and not just how it sounds. From the types of instruments, to technicality, to atmosphere, to the number of people in the band, to the structure, to passages, to transitions, to riffs, solos, production, lyrics, order of songs, and so on...

Maybe that's why I'm so picky :/"

And all those contribute to how a song sounds to an individual. What doesn't contribute to how it sounds is who wrote the song, which is what /u/deka01 was talking about. You wouldn't care if Blind Guardian put out an incredible song written by James Hetfield, and that's the point I'm trying to make."
"BABYMETAL go full Power Metal! Road to Resistance Trailer with Sam Totman and Herman Li from Dragonforce on Guitar's","I'm gonna say that's an exaggeration and you'd be pretty stupid and metal-ignorant to not notice the difference between a Blind Guardian song written by Hansi and André and a Blind Guardian song written by James.

Also, the person/s who writes the song is the most direct influence on the sound so I don't know what the fuck you're talking about."
"BABYMETAL go full Power Metal! Road to Resistance Trailer with Sam Totman and Herman Li from Dragonforce on Guitar's","But then the issue is that the song doesn't sound good. His issue was that the girls themselves weren't writing the music, which is asinine. Furthermore, you kind of missed my point. I did say that the song was an incredible one that James Hetfield wrote. Hypothetically, let's pretend the song is perfect to you. Are you really going to let the fact that someone other than BG wrote it be a factor into your enjoyment of it? If it helps, replace Hetfield with someone like Tuomas Holopainen who has a much more similar style.

What I'm trying to convey is that it shouldn't matter who wrote a song. What should matter is how it sounds, and along with that is included all those elements you mentioned earlier, as well as stuff like consistency. To think of it another way, let's use Sonata Arctica and *Reckoning Night*. Using /u/deka01's logic, someone could say ""I like 'My Selene' (written by Jani Liimatainen) more than 'Misplaced' (written by Tony Kakko) because Jani wrote that song and I like Jani more as a person"".

"BABYMETAL go full Power Metal! Road to Resistance Trailer with Sam Totman and Herman Li from Dragonforce on Guitar's","Forgive me for being elitist, but a group of little girls, designed to be otaku bait, performing music written by idol managers with the intention of making money, just doesn't feel very metal to me."
"BABYMETAL go full Power Metal! Road to Resistance Trailer with Sam Totman and Herman Li from Dragonforce on Guitar's","First off, you can't really consider them ""otaku bait"" anymore, especially since they went viral, played Sonisphere and Heavy Montreal, and collaborated with DragonForce. They're obviously appealing more to the metal community than anything else, since that's where the vast majority of their fans came from.

Secondly, who cares whether something feels ""metal"" or not? It's an arbitrary term that people just use to describe bands they like and don't like. For all I care, this could feel ""EDM"" to me and I'd still listen to it. The ""idol managers"" who put this together are huge self-professed metal fans (look up some interviews with Koba-Metal) that put the group together to utilize the lead singer's powerful voice. If anything, it's a project of love for the idol managers. If they really wanted to just make money, they would've just put together another J-pop idol group. It took BABYMETAL four years before they got to a level where they were making money. It's definitely manufactured quite a bit, but the lead singer wrote the lyrics for this new song, so there's an obvious growing appreciation that they're developing for metal, and for someone who had never listened to metal before when they joined the group (at age 12), some respect needs to go out to her.

I can't disagree more with this sentiment.  Every musical movement that starts as a counter culture is absolutely defined by a ""feeling"".  There is a reason Black Sabbath is considered the birth of metal instead of Deep Purple or Blue Cheer.  Metal's ethos is tangible, its been around for 30+ years and doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Also what will continue are these fads that pop up every few years and inevitably die out because they can pretend to be metal all they want, but when it comes right down to it, they aren't.  Glam Metal and Nu-metal are two examples. I'd throw babymetal in there, but in reality, they have such a niche appeal that they will be completely forgotten in a few years. 

I'm not saying don't listen to them. People should listen to whatever they want, but can we please stop pretending that Babymetal embodies the spirit of metal in any way whatsoever?

EDIT: It was hard conveying my point without sounding kind of like a dick, I just want to clarify that wasn't my objective."
"BABYMETAL go full Power Metal! Road to Resistance Trailer with Sam Totman and Herman Li from Dragonforce on Guitar's","What exactly is the spirit of metal? If it's wide enough to accommodate Sonata Arctica and Burzum, I don't see how it couldn't fit in Babymetal too."
"BABYMETAL go full Power Metal! Road to Resistance Trailer with Sam Totman and Herman Li from Dragonforce on Guitar's","The first two aren't a manufactured pop group.  They write their own music.

"BABYMETAL go full Power Metal! Road to Resistance Trailer with Sam Totman and Herman Li from Dragonforce on Guitar's","First off, props for the Blue Cheer mention.

Second of all, some people say the exact same things about power metal. They claim it's a fad for hyperactive nerds who need some D&amp;D in their music, and they spout the ""it's not metal"" saying towards power metal too. Maybe not here and in /r/metal, but give stuff like Blabbermouth a visit and see how bad it truly is. 

Finally, I have never said that BABYMETAL are a metal band. They're a J-pop group with metal backing that are receiving huge support from parts of the metal community, a bit like Ghost B.C. Calling BABYMETAL a fad is a bit pointless, since they're the only group doing what they do with any meaningful number of fans. Saying idol metal is a fad is like saying ""progressive death metal with violins"" is a fad. I'm not saying it won't die out; I'm absolutely sure it will within the next couple years, but BABYMETAL is not counter-culture. No one's saying that BABYMETAL is embodying the spirit of metal. In fact, most people will tell you that they're almost a guilty pleasure, but saying something doesn't feel ""metal"" is a bs scapegoat argument. Saying you don't like the vocals, the j-pop influence, or the instrumentation is completely valid; saying it doesn't feel like ""metal"" is like saying ""this band isn't good in my opinion, thus they can't be metal"". It's the same crap that people like Slipknot fans and Trivium fans get from elitists that say ""that's not real metal"". 

I'd much rather get an actual explanation from someone saying why they don't like a band rather than just saying it sounds different than everything else I listen to. "

"BABYMETAL go full Power Metal! Road to Resistance Trailer with Sam Totman and Herman Li from Dragonforce on Guitar's","Are the other girls just backing vocals or something? The wiki lists their jobs as being scream and dance but on the handful of baby metal songs I've heard this is the first to have anything remotely like screaming."
"BABYMETAL go full Power Metal! Road to Resistance Trailer with Sam Totman and Herman Li from Dragonforce on Guitar's","It's a bit misleading. It's just those three girls doing vocals. The two younger girls, Yui-Metal and Moa-Metal, do screams and dance, but by ""scream""  they actually mean shouts. They're not doing the growl vocals. [This older song of theirs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2Tu-g-_rEE) illustrates it pretty well. The younger girls do the ""screams"" at 1:18 and 1:23. But in the pre-chorus and chorus where you hear actual growls, that's done by an unnamed vocalist, not the girls. 

Don't be surprised to hear them try to growl in the future, though. Other idol metal groups have started making their members growl in their songs, and plenty of BABYMETAL's songs have growls. The first album is incredibly diverse in that regard."

"Angra - Secret Garden (2014 Japan Release) - Track by Track First Impressions","Fabio Lione in Angra seems like such a strange choice.  Also, I will be making more of an effort to shorten the first impressions of each track by leaving out or leaving a brief note on sections that are not much worth a mention (for not being poor or great).  Shit’s hard.

&amp;nbsp;

**Disclaimer:**  I am in no way a professional reviewer of music; I am just giving my first impressions as a power metal fanatic for those who are wondering if they should pick up the album.  Feel free to offer advice and tips on how to improve this for the future.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Disclaimer 2:**  This is FIRST IMPRESSIONS, and I have found myself to be very picky lately.  If you feel this kind of music is your thing and I do not like it, do not feel bound by one man's unprofessional and shitty opinions.

&amp;nbsp;

**1) Newborn Me**

Interesting industrial/orchestral introduction, I kinda like it.  The real music begins with epic, heavy riffing backed by some more orchestration.  The verse continues with the heavy riffing and some fast-paced vocals; Fabio sounds great to start things off.  The pre-chorus is a solid build up to the chorus (minus an annoying vocal tidbit on the word “despair”).  The chorus has a really nice flow to it.  I did not care for it much when I first started listening to it, but as with a lot of Angra’s music, you have to really listen to it a number of times before you start appreciating it fully.  After the second chorus comes a very neat instrumental section, but who are we kidding - this is Angra, of course they are going to do that well.  Heavy guitar play with Angra’s fantastic drumming, which then leads into a bit of a boring acoustic section.  The solo is quite enjoyable; I love Angra’s solos.  Overall, quite a good song, and well done to Fabio.

&amp;nbsp;

**2) Black Hearted Soul**

Much more of a power metal introduction to this song.  Choir into double bass, lead-guitar driven power metal - great introduction.  The verses are generic; nothing special.  They fit the fast power metal theme and the melody flows in a way which I feel I have heard many times before.  The pre-chorus flies by unnoticed, but into a great chorus.  This is a power metal chorus by all rights.  It has a catchy, soaring melody with nice backing vocals.  The choir comes back for more action after the chorus, followed by a fantastic instrumental section.  God damn Angra, I love your instrumentals.  The solo is quite enjoyable once again; a very melodic solo with a very pleasant sound; Angra has a such distinct sound in their solos.  Until the end this is your standard, furious Angra power metal song and they show they still know how to do it well, capable of holding the spot as an opener for albums such as *Rebirth* or *Temple of Shadows*.

&amp;nbsp;

**3) Final Light**

Starting off very dark and brooding with the help of the heavy guitar riffing and atmospheric keyboards, this song has me intrigued right away.  The first verse lets go of the guitars while the atmosphere kicks it up another notch behind a fantastic sounding Fabio and more keyboards.  Unfortunately the chorus takes away from the atmosphere and flow of the song which is otherwise fantastic (and very… different).  The second verse is more of the same but with the guitars staying to enjoy the show; the verse sounds way more awesome without the guitar.  The solo is not as interested this time, but this is by Angra’s standards.  The solos in this album are very reminiscent of the style of solos on Aurora Consurgens, which is not a bad thing at all.  This song could have been so much more if they dropped the guitars in the second verse as well, and if they put more care into crafting a chorus to maintain the atmosphere that the song was able to create in the beginning.

&amp;nbsp;

**4) Storm of Emotions**

I am really digging this song. The introduction and verse are awesome and Fabio continues to sound phenomenal.  They continue their darker, brooding atmosphere (seems to be a thing since Aurora Consurgens), and my lord is this song doing it perfectly so far.  The chorus manages to be catchy while maintaining that atmosphere, which is impressive song writing.  The second chorus is worth mentioning. Bringing Fabio’s vocals up a notch, it forces some of his higher notes, and he sounds great.  Rafael Bittencourt also gets some time on the vocals in this song, and he sounds great.  I wish he would sing more.  Honestly, I prefer his voice more than Fabio’s, even after the short section he is in.  There are also some choirs near the end that are worth mentioning; catchy while maintaining the brooding atmosphere.  I love Angra’s ability to do this.  I imagine this song getting more spins with me in the future for sure, but it requires a certain mood to really get into it.

&amp;nbsp;

**5) Violet Sky**

I am going to assume this is Rafael again.  Regardless of who it is, he sounds great.  The chorus was awkward, though; and lacking compared to the verse.  I do not think of Angra while listening to this song.  Very experimental piece.  I feel this song will be forgotten.

&amp;nbsp;

**6) Secret Garden**

Simone Simons!  I wish there were male vocals in this song as well.  Oh well; Simone is as enjoyable as she always is, being one of the few female vocalists I like.  She definitely adds the Simone touch to this song, and it sounds great with Angra’s writing.  This is a fairly orchestrated piece, which is interesting to hear from Angra.  Everything about this song is catchy.

&amp;nbsp;

**7) Upper Levels**

Ahh, I found the song with the Brazilian-influenced introduction.  As per usual it is enjoyable, though definitely not on par with other album’s correspondents.  After listening to the verse and chorus, this song feels like filler, which is not common with Angra.  It sounds like a combination of the songs so far from this album while not being as good as any of them.  About midway there is a really nice vocal section (assuming by Rafael again) that is very reminiscent of the unique vocal passage in one of my favorite Angra songs “The Shadow Hunter”.  This is the only part of the song that I really care for.

&amp;nbsp;

**8) Crushing Room**

Heavy riffing introduction between brief dark piano sections.  Exactly the kind of thing I expected (and desired) from the song title.  The verse was nice, but the rest was forgettable.  I could do without this female vocalist.  Doro Pesch is her name, and I do not like her much.  I suppose there is a reason I have never heard of her until this song.

&amp;nbsp;

**9) Perfect Symmetry**

Second double bass song of the album.  In a way, it is disappointing to have to type that at track 9.  Sounds absolutely fantastic to start off, though.  Angra needs to go back to this.  No other band has done it like they have (besides Age of Artemis’ first album, which was also pretty good).  This song is definitely the most uplifting song.  Angra seems to not be trying with the verses of their double bass songs on this album.  They just want to get to the chorus, I suppose.  Black Hearted Soul had better vocal melodies in the chorus, but I quite enjoy the keyboards in the chorus of this song.  After the second chorus comes one of the best parts of the album, an absolutely phenomenal orchestral section.  At this point I now realize Angra’s next album needs to be a symphonic power metal venture.  Just do it, please Angra.  Just once.  With your own Angra touch.  I digress… the solo is a bit generic, unfortunately.  The song ends with another short orchestral section, and it is great once again.  I imagine I will come back to this song to check it out again, but first impressions are there is not much to keep me coming back besides those orchestral parts.

&amp;nbsp;

**10) Silent Call**

I guess the closest thing Angra has done to this song is Lease of Life?  Even then, it sounds quite a bit different than that - quite a bit different than any Angra.  There is no Fabio singing once again - I find it kind of funny how little singing he has done on this album.  This song is forgettable.  The vocals by Rafael are fantastic but it is a bit cheesy and I feel like I have heard songs like this many times before.

&amp;nbsp;

Angra is such a dark band now; so much different than the Andre Matos era and the beginning of the Edu Falaschi era.  The production of this album is great, and it has some great parts, but overall, it does not come close to the glory of *Angels Cry* or *Temple of Shadows*.  Bands are allowed to change, and there is nothing wrong with that, but I think with a bit more care this album could have been fantastic.  As it stands from first impressions, I would say it is good; nothing more, nothing less.  A step up from Aqua, although nothing reaches the awesomeness of “Arising Thunder”."

"[Community] What about adding more mods?","This really hasn't been an issue in the past - until only the last few weeks, (and honestly even now) this subreddit self-regulated very well. We're a relatively small and respectful group. 

But I think that all of us have noticed some recent developments in the subreddit. None of them have been too egregious, but if left unchecked have the potential to become much more problematic and detrimental to the community. Due to the small size of this sub, even heavily downvoted posts can end up on our frontpage, and now seems like the time to resolve this before it has the chance to get any worse. 

**/u/SpeakMouthWords** - Don't get me wrong - I think our mod and founder are doing a great job right now. But it's hard to tell how active you are with the low profile you keep. One person can't keep an eye on things around the clock, and without a few other people to bounce ideas off of, it can be hard for one person to know how to respond to specific situations and users in the best way. 

I know in the past there have been some threads about setting up weekly discussions, or updating the sidebar, etc. that didn't really get mod attention. That can be frustrating in a small community like this, when you aren't sure whether the mods disagree, don't care, or simply didn't even see the post. 

I'm sure there are several fantastic and mature Mighty Warriors (is that what we're calling ourselves?) who have been quietly contributing to the community that we could ask to step up.

I do really think that mushmancat is a good candidate for the job. He might have his transgressions every now and then, but I don't think they will continue if he becomes a mod.

Anyways, this is all moot until we get a bigger census of the sub and SpeakMouthWords' opinion on the matter."

"[Community] What about adding more mods?","You can hardly hate him for having an opinion. I liked about half the bands on his list too. I just think the difference with most people and mushmancat is that he's pretty extreme with his beliefs. Whereas a band like Amaranthe I'm rather indifferent on, mmc will actively hate them and denounce them. But I can't see him being so outspoken on stuff like that if he gets power on this sub."

So many lyrics in power metal are about fantasy, ancient stuff, demons &amp; wizards, mystical themes, good vs. evil, and so on. 

This religious stuff falls kinda into the same category of fiction/fantasy. To me it's just another set of silly lyrics. I just try to ignore them and enjoy the really good music. "

:(

As for the bands, I will make sure to complain if a really bad band makes it on there. Haven't seen any so far. The less popular ones actually have a great sound. The guy making the album gives a shit if they would play Sonata well, and he's very carefully choosing the last couple of bands.

Examples:

[Innvein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg0_38iQ624) &lt;-their singer's actually great!

[Sunrise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGJlG0fYbGg) &lt;-Sunrise has been posted around here quite a bit

[Majesty of Revival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoezC-kZ6vM) &lt;-The cage seems like a great song for this band to cover

[Celestial Wish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Hb5FnwDnMU) &lt;-A female singer on paid in full sounds like a great idea if you ask me, it's not a super demanding song and I think this band (which is probably the least famous of those announced) could do it well.

"Iron Savior - 07 Iron Warrior (Rise of the Hero)","What do you mean by ""actual guitar amps"" out of curiosity?  Either way I have always really enjoyed the unique tone of the guitars in Iron Savior.

As for this song, it is quite the bore to me.  Iron Savior has done a bunch of great stuff, but this song sounds too generic.  Was not a fan of any of the music off of this album, really.  Which sucks, because the artwork kicks ass."

"Iron Savior - 07 Iron Warrior (Rise of the Hero)","Hmm, I see nothing wrong with it when I enjoy the sound.

The answer is EASILY *Battering Ram*.  What a magical album.  From the bad-ass, ass-kicking ""Battering Ram"", reaching into atmosphere with the entrancing ""Wings of Deliverance"" (best song of the album), and riding towards the epic and catchy ""Tyranny of Steel"", it is a fantastic album.  Piet is at his best here as well; vocally his most astounding album.

What would be your favorite Iron Savior album?  To be honest, I have not gotten into them too much besides Battering Ram.  Do you have a top list of suggestions?"
"Iron Savior - 07 Iron Warrior (Rise of the Hero)","I try to get into IS whenever there is a new album, but I just can't. I think it's the mix of metal and hard rock, his voice and that guitar sound. Maybe the Ram will change my mind. I only have the first album, and I don't dislike it. :p

"A guide for my journey into PowerMetal","Hey everyone, 

First, thanks to everyone that contributes to this sub. 

I enjoy the complexity of some classical music. A few months back I saw [this nearly scientific headline](http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/metal-science/science-proves-metal-fans-and-classical-fans-are-identical-personality-wise) and thought I could be missing out on a whole genre of music. I talked to a friend of mine that's into metal about where I might find bands or songs that hit the things I like. 

Sure enough, after some discussion, experimentation and planning my route on [a map](http://mapofmetal.com/#/home) I landed on power metal. Not surprising to anyone here and I'm honestly really glad to have this whole new world before me. 

However, I'm at a plateau and I think I need some guidance in order to ascend to another level. I have a list of maybe 10 or so songs I think are amazing and really do have a rich depth to them, and I'm wondering what else I might be missing. 

What (as best I can tell) I'm looking for is the real masterpieces of melodic power metal. Or maybe not - I have no idea. One place I won't compromise is vocals - harsh vocals just do not do it for me, it just reminds me of people doing a Christian Bale Batman impression. 

Here's a few examples of what I know I do like and I am aware of so far - my tastes are strange, I don't seek forgiveness for that. 

DragonForce: Cry Thunder, Through the Fire and the Flames, The Fire Still Burns

Nightwish: I Wish I Had an Angel, Nemo

Pathfinder: Fifth Element

Blind Guardian: Battlefield, Mirror Mirror

Rhapsody: Lord of Thunder

Angra: Carry On

There's a few others - I can't remember which Helloween song fell into this category, but they have one I think. 

What's strange to me is that for most of these songs they rarely show up in the ""most popular"" categories of the bands that made them. Many of those bands are prolific as well, so I might otherwise have to weed through hours of albums to find something similar. 

I appreciate in advance any suggestions! 

EDIT: To clarify - I'm looking for individual songs that are similar to the ones noted above. I've picked through a fair number of albums on the sidebar previously and since I've found a few things I like a lot - but it's like 1% of what I've listened to so far. I'm hoping to increase that ratio. "
"A guide for my journey into PowerMetal","Check out Lost Horizon. They only released two full lengths, but they are both heralded as prime examples of power metal almost universally."
"A guide for my journey into PowerMetal","Thanks! Listening now - they have a really varied sound, it's really interesting. "
"A guide for my journey into PowerMetal","The song that got me into power metal was [Sonata Arctica - San Sebastian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA0IAbizUfg), maybe you'll like it as well. Sonata Arctica is quite an interesting band if you haven't checked them out. Their composition in songs gets more complicated as you go through their albums from early to more recent. (Except for the last two albums but let's not dwell on that)"

"A guide for my journey into PowerMetal","Hibria - The Skull Collectors, Masterplan - Aeronautics and Kamelot - The Black Halo are my go-to albums for power newbies. 

If you can dig some progressive elements in your power metal, then Seventh Wonder are easily my favourite band of all-time. Listen to the Mercy Falls album.

If you like any of those, I have several hundred more to suggest."
"A guide for my journey into PowerMetal","Thanks, I'll get on these. Though.... I don't think it's necessarily a newbie thing. I've listened to a fair number of albums in the sidebar, which is how I picked the songs out that I mentioned. What I'm looking for is specific songs that are similar to the ones I've found that I really like. For example, I like Dragonforce and all, but from the whole of Inhuman Rampage one song REALLY does it for me. "
"A guide for my journey into PowerMetal","It's just that the range of bands you mentioned are all entry-level power metal; it's not a negative thing whatsoever, it just meant I could suggest some more well-known bands right off the bat :) Each of those albums are super melodic, and I, like you, have a heap of albums from bands that I generally dig, but only like a song of two of. Each of my suggestions hold strong variety with very different melodies. Hope one clicks with you :)"

"A guide for my journey into PowerMetal","I can't help you too much trying to find individual songs

But if you're into classical stuff, then Avantasia's first two albums (The Metal Opera pt 1 + 2) might appeal, as might any of Fairyland's stuff (try the songs ""Of wars in Osyrhia"" or ""Score to a New beginning"" for a sample. Also I definitely spelled Osyrhia wrong.)

Otherwise maybe try some Neoclassical stuff like Dark Moor or Yngwie Malmsteen?

Moving on - I see you like Pathfinder's Fifth Element, I would make sure you listen to Pathway to the Moon, Stardust and Beyond the Space Beyond the Time from their first album if you haven't already.

If you like longer stuff, check out Symphony X's Odyssey (the song, 24mins long, has an orchestra).

Otherwise I'm not sure how to help you.

The Australian band Domain have a lighter sound, you may wish to try them- the songs ""Last days of Utopia"" and ""A New Beginning"" are good."
"A guide for my journey into PowerMetal","This is great, thanks. I always expect to like Symphony X but for some reason every time I give an album listen I just... I dunno, maybe I build them up to much and I'm not listening objectively. "
"A guide for my journey into PowerMetal","I got into them by listening to iconoclast. Their last two albums have a pretty different sound then the others. "

"A guide for my journey into PowerMetal","In response to what u/Vortiene said (not linking to to the chain so you get the reply directly):

If you do find yourself getting into Sonata Arctica and start to do some research, you're going to find some very polarizing opinons on the more recent half of their discography.  

I stress to you that you give all four albums (Unia, Winterheart's Guild, Stones Grow Her Name, and Pariah's Child) an honest chance.  None of those albums were necesarily 'bad', but it's hard to find a majority of people who find any of them 'good'.

Starting in Unia, SA got very experimental with their sound, leading to folks being split about what works and what doesn't.  You'll find just as many people who don't care for the last two albums (u/Vortiene) as those who do (myself)

Go into their stuff with an opened unbiased mind and find what works for you."

"What's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?","It occurred to me recently that while I don't always like many huge metal bands, there are a few that I'm nuts about who've never been heard by anyone?

"What's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?","I'm going to take ""unknown"" as less than 2,000 listeners on last.fm.

I've posted about this band quite a few times here and have told everyone I know about them, yet they still only have 1,784 listeners on last.fm. I know they have more fans than that and they're doing relatively okay in Brazil, so this surprises me.

This was one of my top albums of 2013. Best female vocalist in metal, in my opinion:

* [Vandroya - The Last Free Land](http://youtu.be/aZT2m-KtWF0)

* [Vandroya - Why Should We Say Goodbye? (Music Video)](http://youtu.be/W9pXKIYhTCM)


Also, this was one of the best live shows in 2014. Their vocalist is Urban breed (ex-Tad Morose, Bloodbound). They are phenomenal. Only 998 listeners on last.fm.

"What's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?","Seven Kingdoms is a local power metal band from Orlando that just hit 10000 Facebook fans.

"What's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?","Judging from the 241 followers they have on spotify, Dragon Guardian isn't very well known."
"What's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?","It is in the Japanese scene."
"What's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?","I'm gonna go with From the Dark. Only have one album so far (entitled The Opera Ghost), but it's a doozy - very dark and moody, but with plenty of badass riffs. Imagine if Kamelot ditched the symphonic elements and listened to a fuckload of Mercyful Fate and Portrait, and you've got the idea.

The album is [available for free](https://soundcloud.com/from-the-dark) on Soundcloud, and apparently they're working on new stuff now.

"What's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?","Custard. Seriously, how much more metal can you possibly sound with a name? Their music kicks ass and is just essential, old school power metal that makes you want to go reclaim your fallen kingdom:

Not many songs of theirs on youtube, but I'm going to upload some when I get a chance. [For My King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ryv9uHWLTY)"

"What's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?","As an Iranian, I can't stand Angband. For the longest time I was really disappointed that the only major power metal band from Iran was bland, poorly produced, and incredible generic.

"What's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?","I think i got two that my might be fairly unknown to most.

[Powermad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irBTuU4WzVo), a band that play a mix of power and thrash metal, they only released an album in 1989and i think that album is the absolute bomb, it's a glorious mix of power and thrash and it just fucking works, catchy, riffy, and the bass is actually there which is rare for ""moderner"" power metal.

[Wicked Maraya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMkQDH_S_FY), the heaviest power metal i have ever heard and sadly not a direction taken by the power metal community, as you all must have noticed the traditional power metal band sings in a happier tune with symphonies and fantasy lyrics which is not a bad thing, but i would love to see how power metal would sound if it took a heavier approach, in a sense, a more metal approach. Also, you can't deny the riffs on this album, another lacking aspect in power metal, this album has some of the most consistent riffing i have ever heard in a power metal album."
"What's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?","Really liking that Wicked Maraya"
"What's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?","I figured you would, sadly both the albums are one hit wonders. Wicked Maraya would later evolve into just Maraya but they played a more progressive sound that wasn't as good as the album on the Wicked Maraya name."
"What's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?","Zonata are absolutley fucking amazing. ~10k listeners on last.fm, is that too many?"
"What's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?","Only 10k? Thats ridiculous, they are awesome and not exactly newcomers. (Okay they split up, but that doesn't mean their albums weren't great)"

"What do you think about: Pellek - Cloud Dancers","I gave this a good go, so here's my zero fucks given track-by-track.
All are first time impressions except for the title track.

## Enveloped in Smoke (Dead Night)

This is a great intro. It's a bit long for being an intro track, so I don't really know what to call it. It contains lots of spoken parts, so it still gives off the vibes of an intro track.
Anyways, this is chill stuff, and the lyrics are pretty easily processed poetry, which I like, so thumbs up from me.
I like the mood it sets.

## The Grey Ballet

This wants to be pretty heavy, but the sound and theme of the album doesn't really allow it.
I don't like all the directions PelleK is taking with his vocals in this, and the spoken parts feel out of place.

Partially all right.

## Tempest

Hey, there's some fast drum action going on here, I can work with this.
I would call this power metal. I like how the orchestration is fluttering in the chorus - creates some feelings of disorientation.
PelleK does a vocal solo at 2:42. Guess some of you should beware of this song.

## Restless Butterfly

Starts out as some kind of melody based piano ballad.
Guitars are added after one fourth of the song, for some mandatory heaviness.
The solo is not that fun, and the stick afterwards is pretty forgettable too.

## Dragonflight

I like how this starts out. It settles down pretty quickly, but it keeps its cool.
These lyrics are metal as fuck. I love this kind of shit. Dragons, thunder and fire.
There are a few short bursts of double bass drums, it's fucking perfect.

The chorus is awesome. I mean, in reality kind of plain, but this gives me a cool feeling and that's what matters most to me.

The solo reminds me of my childhood when I listened to MIDI interpretations of the Secret of Mana soundtrack. Good times.

## On The Lions' Back

The intro brings Ocean of Opportunity to mind for a while, and then merges with Gloryhammer's Magic Dragon and becomes pretty fucking nice. I feel like it flirts a bit with Final Fantasy VI's soundtrack too.
Right, so this is an instrumental song. I wouldn't place it together with Hammerfall's masterpieces that are Something for the Ages and Raise the Hammer, but I have to say that it is pretty damn moody.
It's good.

## Cloud Dancers

Oh, the title track. BRING THE DOWNVOTES, BITCHES!
This song reveals to you the key to how enjoy this album: leave your analytics at the door.
What you should do is to totally embrace the fact that this stuff is pretty swingy.
Not that too much happens in this song, but I think it would've been better off if it was even simpler. The chorus is chillout.

## Carillon Canticle

Didn't get that title at all first. Looked it up: it's pretty metal.

So this is some positive song, written like it was jambic poetry.
I think I see what he is doing, but I kind of don't get it.
Guess I'll have to give it a few more listens before I can fully appreciate this.

Also, I think there's a Nyan Cat reference in here at the end...

## Battle Supreme

Alright, so this is the second full-blown power metal song in this album I would say. It contains, like, most power metal elements.
It honors the musical theme of the album, but would probably have been better if it didn't. I could have used some standard power to finish this off.

---

I liked this. If I could take only one track with me from this album, it would definitely be _On the Lions' Back_.

"What do you think about: Pellek - Cloud Dancers","I feel like I've said this before. Anyways, I gave it a chance. *Ocean of Opportunity* wasn't too bad and PelleK's put out some great music in the past (as well as some crap stuff). *Cloud Dancers* was horrible. It's overly self-indulgent, the music isn't nearly as good as the previous two albums, and the songs themselves just aren't memorable or well-written.

"Axenstar - Where Dreams Are Forgotten (2014) - Track by Track First Impressions","Is Axenstar’s new album any more interesting and coherent than 2011’s *Aftermath*?  Does it recapture any of their early day’s magic from 2002’s *Perpetual Twilight* or 2003’s *Far from Heaven*?  Well, I don’t know, decide for yourself!  This isn’t a damn review, it’s a track-by-track first impressions.




**Disclaimer:**  I am in no way a professional reviewer of music; I am just giving my first impressions as a power metal fanatic for those who are wondering if they should pick up the album.  Feel free to offer advice and tips on how to improve this for the future.  




**Disclaimer 2:**  This is FIRST IMPRESSIONS, and I have found myself to be very picky lately.  If you feel this kind of music is your thing and I do not like it, do not feel bound by one man's unprofessional and shitty opinions.




**1) Fear**

The intro to this song is energetic and it kicks your ass with some sweet, varied drumming and rhythm guitars.  Considering the intro and verse alone, this is a great start to the album.  The verse continues with this energy with a beautifully flowing vocal melody.  Right away you can notice the improvements in Magnus Winterwild’s control of his voice, and it is quite nice.  The pre-chorus is the most awkward part of the song, coming in too early and completely disrupts the energy and flow of the song - the song takes a big hit because of it.  The chorus does not do a good job of saving it either.  It is hard to tell you have even made it to the chorus.  You can tell they put a decent amount of thought into the structure of the chorus, but it does not captivate, it does not stick in your head, and it does not bring the energy back from the beginning of the song.  The best word I can use to describe the chorus is awkward, though to be honest, it does have a hint of something that makes me think maybe I’ll come back to it.  After the second chorus comes a riffing interlude which is a bit boring but serves its purpose as a transition into the guitar solo/more interlude.  This is probably the second best part of the song.  It is the only section that matches the introduction’s energy.  The song then ends with its awkward chorus.


**2) Inside the Maze**

Insize the Maze starts with a very generic power metal intro - sounds nice, but is nothing special.  The verse is fairly catchy, and it really showcases the vocalist’s new control with his voice.  The pre-chorus is good - nothing great, but leads up to the chorus nicely.  The chorus is still kind of awkward.  Maybe it his voice making the chorus’ awkward?  I am not sure, I enjoy a lot of their older chorus’.  That said, it is more fitting to the song than Fear’s, but I am not sure if I would say it is better.  The bridge after the second chorus is alright, though it really showcases a lack of emotion in Magnus’ voice.  The solo that follows is nice.  I like what they are doing with the solos so far - instead of throwing every note in that they, they try to create a melody and build a solo around said melody.  And they do it quite well.  The song ends off with a repeat of all the vocal sections in order, and then the chorus repeats again in a higher key.  I do not imagine coming back to this song - while there was no notable bad parts, there was nothing captivating enough to make me think “let’s go listen to Inside the Maze again!”


**3) My Sacrifice**

The style of the first several seconds of this song makes me think they got the idea from Helloween’s “My Sacrifice”.  In-fact, I am pretty sure they did, though they went with a less epic route.  After this little part comes some deliciously heavy riffing, and boy does it sound great.  The verse kicks in keeping the sweet energy flowing that the song has created, and damn is it a great verse - this is what I am talking about!  The rhythm of the song so far has been fairly diverse and interesting.  Then the chorus hits… ugh.  What used to be Axenstar’s strongest writing point has seemed to become their weakest.  Which is a shame, because the chorus is usually the staple of a song - being the most repeated part of a song, and being the most notable in terms of melody and structure.  Again, awkward!  The energy is simply not there.  What a damn shame.  The solo is the least interesting of the album so far.  Ending with another chorus, this is definitely the most disappointing song of the album so far.  So much potential, fantastic writing, leading up to such a shitty chorus that feels like they just stopped caring about the song.


**4) Curse of the Tyrant**

Jeez, this is definitely the heaviest material I have heard from Axenstar (the album in general, including this song).  And I like it.  They really know how to do heavy song-writing.  Fantastic introduction, with keyboards, guitars, and drums that help make the song’s title feel very relevant.  The verse is nothing special, albeit fitting.  The pre-chorus has some of Magnus’ most aggressive vocals, which is not saying much - still, it sounds awesome.  Then comes the best chorus of the album so far.  The irony here is the chorus does not come until after the second verse.  It is nothing amazing, but it is definitely decent and it fits with the rest of the song, which is a nice change.  The solos have definitely begun to lose their touch.  After the short solo is a bit of a guitar interlude that is trying to recapture the image of the song, but feels like it is missing something.  The song realizes that after several seconds and decides to reintroduce that atmosphere with keyboards and heavy guitars.  The song ends expectedly, going pre-chorus &gt; chorus &gt; chorus with key change.  Again, I do not see myself coming back to this song.  Despite being probably the best song so far, I still can’t find any magic in this album that entrances me to come back.


**5) The Return**

Been a lot to say about the first 4 songs, but this one not as much.  The introduction is boring, the verse is fairly catchy, the pre-chorus is decent, and the chorus is forgettable.  Some nice, atmospheric keyboards placed throughout this song, though.  Solo is forgettable, and the ending is like the rest from this album.


**6) Demise**

The heaviness returns, which is unsurprising considering the title of the song.  I love the subtle use of well-placed, atmospheric keyboard pads throughout this album as they use it here.  It is disappointing nothing has really kept me interested.  The verse is fairly generic.  The song skips the pre-chorus all together, and the chorus that follows is the most boring and uninspired of the album to this point.  Whoa, what happened here?  It is almost as if they realized “shit, hey guys, none of my vocals has any emotion throughout this album - how about we do this little part right here?”  After the second chorus comes a fantastic aggressive part by Magnus.  Is that really him?  This is the best I have ever heard from him in all of Axenstar’s discography.  This part really fits in with the heavy theme in this album.  The solo that follows is the best of the album as well.  Two great parts in a row - it is a shame that the rest of the song is so mediocre.  Dammit, Axenstar.  You need to put more care into each song and make sure each song flows properly.  The song fades out with some out of place generic heavy riffing that feels like its there just to say “hey, remember this song is heavy and we’re heavy… yeah…”.


**7) Annihilation**

Without a doubt the best introduction of the album so far.  The keyboards start it off with some sort of light bells, for lack of a better word, creating for what I feel is a twisted take on the atmosphere behind “annihilation”.  The keyboards continue while some of the best clean guitar I’ve heard from Axenstar joins in, creating for some of the best instrumentals I have heard from Axenstar in this album yet.  This atmosphere abruptly stops and Axenstar’s heavy instrumentals come galloping in, kicking off the verse instantly alongside the heavy power metal.  This part is pretty awesome as well, turning away from the twisted take on annihilation to the more fitting, heavy take on it.  The pre-chorus is empty and forgettable, but the chorus is pretty decent.  While it is nothing great, Magnus decides to show some emotion here with a slight yell to his voice.  The interlude after the second chorus is nothing worth nothing, although the solo that follows is pretty decent.  The guitar has a really nice sound here.  Then the song changes things up a bit.  They repeat the chorus, but instead of ending the song, the galloping drums return, the rhythm guitar goes silent, and the song focuses on the lead guitar and keyboards.  This is a nice change of pace from the standard strong structure, and it is a nice interlude at that.  Then the pre-chorus shows its face again, and then the chorus for a fourth time, ending the song very abruptly.  As much as the chorus comes back, I do not think I will be.  Which is sad, considering this is one of the better songs so far.  And we only have 4 more to go.


**8) Greed**

This song slows things down quite a bit in comparison to the rest of the song, starting with generic heavy riffing.  The verse is also pretty heavy, and Magnus’ shows off his newfound (somewhat) aggressive voice that actually contains some emotion - quite enjoyable.  The pre-chorus slows things down a bit more while Magnus’ repeats the last words of the verse slowly.  The chorus then follows, as is standard, and this is definitely the best chorus of the album.  It is a throwback to old Axenstar for sure, with catchy melodies and harmonies.  The bridge after the second chorus is a good lead into the solo, and this solo is quite enjoyable.  They definitely put care into molding this one.  Following the solo is a heavy riffing interlude (lots of those), and then the song ends with repetition of the chorus.  I imagine myself coming back to this song, and it is definitely the best song of the album so far.  Still, it is nothing amazing, which is disappointing.  Axenstar was one of the first bands that got me into not-DragonForce power metal.


**9) The Reaper**

Mmf, that riff; very refreshing for power metal, making for a fantastic introduction.  Good verse as well, with a bit of a march rhythm.  The lead guitar does the pre-chorus this time around, and the chorus is quite enjoyable as well.  After the second chorus is a heavy guitar interlude with some blast beats and heavy keyboards to boot.  The solo is beautiful and surprisingly relates to the song title the most out of all the parts of the song.  After the solo is another guitar interlude, focussing more on the lead instead of heavy rhythm guitars, and is a nice build-up to the ending chorus.  This is the new best song of the album, as every part is quite good.  Still - I will not call it fantastic!


**10) This False Imagery**

This False Imagery puts things back to speed - literally.  Up comes the tempo, in comes the double bass, and the soaring keyboards.  The instrumentals are quite enjoyable here, with the keyboards creating the most of the atmosphere, as per usual.  The verse is pretty generic and boring.  The pre-chorus is pretty catchy, though.  The chorus is intricate and there is a lot to it in terms of rhythm and melody.  That said, it does not hook me, and it does not do a good job in making me want to come back.  After the second chorus comes some of the best instrumentals of this album.  The rhythm guitar fades out into some atmospheric - a key word in this album - clean guitars.  Lead guitars come in to amplify this atmosphere, as well as a very noticeable bass line and appropriate drumming.  The solo that follows is quite enjoyable, albeit short.  The solos continue to be a dominant force on this album.  The song ends with its very intricate chorus.  Even if it does not hook me, I can really appreciate the song-writing here.  Overall, I probably will listen to this song again.  I enjoyed that interlude far too much.


**11) Sweet Farewell**

The last song on this album really slows things down.  The vocals start the verse fairly quickly, and it is quite the snooze.  The pre-chorus is a snooze, and so is the chorus.  The interlude after the second chorus is definitely the most enjoyable part.  Some brooding rhythm guitar and marching drums, with some atmospheric (there it is again) lead guitar.  If the rest of the song was this quality, then we might have something.  This interlude definitely drags on too long, though.  The solo is one of the weaker of this album, no sections of it really standing out.  The song ends kind of awkwardly with boring chugging and random lead guitar.  I am not sure if Axenstar has done a good song at this slow of a tempo, and I am not sure if they can.  Poor end to the album.




Overall, I am pretty disappointed, but I expected it from the single, and from their last album.  However, this is definitely a big step up.  They are trying to create a balance between modern heaviness and the catchy, atmospheric and flowery melodies of Sonata Arctica-like power metal.  They are almost there.  I am quite interested to see what their next album has to offer, if there will be one.

"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Well, I did a Top 20 list last year (that I apparently never posted here on /r/PowerMetal), and this year I was asked to make a Top 30 list by The Metal Observer, the site I write reviews and articles for. I'm not gonna bore you guys with 30 paragraphs of fawning over each album on this list. Besides, I'm gonna exclude 10 of the albums that I don't think are close enough to ""power metal"". I'll still mention the non-power metal albums and their positions, but I'll only write summaries for my top 10 power metal albums (leaving 10 power metal albums that won't get write-ups). Later on this month, I'll publish my Top 30 list in full detail on The Metal Observer and I'll link to it once it's posted, in case any of you care at all. 

I was worried my list would be too obscure and pretentious, but it's actually not that bad in hindsight. It definitely felt like a better year than 2013, and there's still stuff I feel like I haven't digested well enough yet. So I've got some quick Honorable Mentions that didn't make the list just because I don't feel like I have a good enough grip on the album yet. Let's get to it:

11. **Aldious** - [*Dazed and Delight*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NY7S7b7PO8)

10\. **Kamijo** - [*Heart*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg_DOt-xyig): Easily the best JPM album of 2014. The symphonic passages are absolutely incredible, and anyone who can appreciate Kamijo's voice is sure to enjoy *Heart*. There's a wide variety of styles present on the album, and variety is exactly what I've been wanting from Japan for a while now. If you're a fan of Japanese power metal, Versailles, or you just want something a little different than most Europower bands, this is your best bet for the year.

9\. **MindMaze** - [*Back from the Edge*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC-GsMPLsgg): This is an improvement over *Mask of Lies* in every way. MindMaze may be female-fronted, but their style is much more akin to Queensrÿche or Seven Kingdoms. Sarah Teet's voice is absolutely incredible throughout, and some of Jeff's solos are so well-composed that they'll grab your attention before you know it. Also, Mike LePond from Symphony X plays bass here, so that's cool too.

8\. **Epica** - [*The Quantum Enigma*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7IIYIFljZM): The folks over at /r/SymphonicMetal are buzzing like crazy about this album, and with good reason. It's aggressive, driven, and it's on-par with the band's early material. I think everyone knows what Epica are capable of if they've heard even a fraction of their discography; this album is pretty much a cumulation of all their strengths and none of their weaknesses.

7\. **Ninth Circle** - [*Legions of the Brave*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89MQSGUKjrA): I really wish more people would have listened to this album. It flew under everyone's radar, and I only heard it because I had to review it. It's ended up as my top USPM album and top independent album of the year. *Legions of the Brave* is a bit different than most USPM albums. They have a fair bit of influence from the European bands, as well as an incredible knack for writing catchy choruses. Riffs-galore on this album, and it's an album that you should all give a try.

6\. **Black Fate** - [*Between Visions &amp; Lies*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEbDO9k1XVI): If you miss Roy Khan, this album is the cure for that. Vasilis Georgiou is a dead ringer for Roy Khan, and the music sounds very similar to Ghost Opera-era Kamelot. Even without the Kamelot comparison, it's an incredibly solid and consistent album with some great hooks and riffs. It's a good break from all the fantasy-themed stuff, and it's a great album in its own right.

5\. **DragonForce** - [*Maximum Overload*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7F3SU5BRw): I'm sure everyone's formed their own opinion on this by now. Frankly, I liked it just as much as *The Power Within*. Marc seems to be finding his place in the band quite comfortably, and that feeling on the last album that some of the songs weren't written for him is no longer an issue. 

4\. **Vanishing Point** - [*Distant is the Sun*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od7PPU4kMVQ): Australia's finest export puts out another amazing album. With a melancholic and energetic sound, it's recommended for fans of Sonata Arctica and Kamelot. Some of the album borders more towards progressive metal, but it's done well enough to be captivating and keep your attention. 

3\. **Sonata Arctica** - [*Pariah's Child*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxdHhemkLKo): The band's kicking butt again, and after the shockingly terrible nightmare that was *Stones Grow Her Name*, I'm happy that I'm no longer ashamed to be a Sonata Arctica fan again. The replay value on this album is surprisingly high, and there's quite an eclectic mix of styles and influences on *Pariah's Child*. If you gave up on Sonata Arctica over the past two or three albums, this is the one you'll want to listen to.

2\. **Triosphere** - [*The Heart of the Matter*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0): This is even better than 2010's *The Road Less Travelled*, and that's a difficult feat to achieve. There are a lot of *feels* to be had on this album. If you've never listened to Triosphere before, they're pretty much the equivalent of a keyboard-less Symphony X with a female singer. Having only been released about a month ago, this is one album I expect most power metal fans to have on their top albums list in some capacity. 

1\. **Outloud** - [*Let's Get Serious*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkCEaUkfOM0): My #1 power metal album of 2014 was by Outloud, a Greek hard rock/power metal band, featuring Bob Katsionis of Firewind on guitar and keyboards. Considering Katsionis has written many of Firewind's most iconic and memorable songs since *Allegiance*, that should give you a good idea as to what to expect from Outloud. The songs are infectiously catchy, they're earnest, and they're exactly how hard rock and power metal need to be melded flawlessly. There's not a single weak song on this album, and I dare someone to listen to this album and not have a single chorus stuck in their head.

I hope that was worth something to you guys. Comments are appreciated; the more aggressive and belittling, the better. Don't be afraid to really tear into me for not having Sabaton, Freedom Call, or Noble Beast. 

[Here's to an end of a year, and the promises of the beginning of another great year...or something like that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EfhAFA2yFE)"
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Interesting how you have Twilight Force and Delain on your top 20 and Mushman has it on his bottom 10. Ne Obliviscaris' album must be incredible though, definitely going to give it a listen. These lists also make me realize just how much good music I'm missing out on. Only one way to fix that i suppose."
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","&gt; Comments are appreciated; the more aggressive and belittling, the better.

What a horrible list, your tastes are stupid, Japanese power metal is worse than Hitler, BABYMETAL is stupid, you're stupid, and so on and so forth.

Just kidding, though i won't question your choices (the lack of Noble Beast is troublesome), picking Outloud as your top album is super interesting because in all your top 20, it's the record that imo it's not power metal. Just my 2 cents."
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Eh, even acknowledging that wouldn't change anything about the list. Just think of Triosphere as being as my #1 power metal album of 2014. Outloud sounds close enough to Firewind that I feel OK about including it with the power metal entries.

I don't know if you were serious with that Japanese power metal comment, but I only have 4 JPM albums in my list, and the highest ranking one is #10. But don't you dare besmirch the name of Hitler."
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","I was kidding about jpm of course, it's your list, you can put whatever you feel like it deserves to be in the list."
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Oh, I didn't know you guys would be that tolerant of my choices. In that case, BABYMETAL is #1 album of the decade."
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","I fully accept and support BABYMETAL as our new master and overlord."
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","I liked a lot of the list and put it on my ""bands to check out"". I was surprised to learn that there are so many female-fronted power metal bands out there. 

There were some I didn't like, mostly because I don't like growly vocals. "
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","&gt; I was surprised to learn that there are so many female-fronted power metal bands out there.

There's a shit ton of female-fronted power metal out there if you look for them. Here are a few bands that didn't make my list:

[Light Bringer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTPRlS36K0)  
[Albion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW8C_ze5NKc)  
[Cyntia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghauU_VBtDg)  
[Mary's Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLM2unV0kwU)  
[Amberian Dawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNs8Z6W7Y8Y)  
[Fortaleza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNJ34CTdZ-s)  
[Pythia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ6e1ibOd40)

As you can tell, most of the decent female-fronted stuff is coming out of Japan, but the really great stuff is coming from elsewhere. There's also a lot of crap, but my top 20 list is completely devoid of that :)"
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","&gt; most of the decent female-fronted stuff 

That's one of the best parts of power metal vs other forms of rock. Voices that won't fit with other forms of rock work well with it. 

Albion is a surprise to me. A lot of Japanese music has a huge Enka influence, but they sound very European power metal. "
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","&gt; I don't like growly vocals

Mah nigga"
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Great, I love these posts! :) I've been meaning to check out most of these albums, but my listening backlog is so damn huge... But since everyone is so fond of my opinions, I'll check out the links for your top 10 now (in descending order)!

* **Outloud**: I definitely recognize the Firewind sound in the riffs here! A pretty awesome crossover between power and hard rock, this. It's not something I'd expect on the very top of your list. I'll commend you for not shying away from allowing pure catchiness play a major role.  
* **Triosphere**: I've been meaning to get into Triosphere for a while now. I've heard this track before, but listening intently to it now really has me sold - this is some of the best power metal stuff I've heard, female-fronted or in general.  
* **Sonata Arctica**: I'm a huge fan of SA. I enjoyed Pariah's Child, but I'm surprised to see this album in everyone's top list. Granted, *The Wolves Die Young* is a killer track and arguably the strongest one of the album, I generally thought the album was quite quirky. I have an odd fascination for the track *Half a Marathon Man*, which is most likely the most catchy song I've ever heard. The rest have obviously not made a lasting impression, since I don't remember any of them. That's just me, of course. Don't get me wrong, Pariah's Child was most definitely a step up from the previous two albums, but I'm still waiting for the ""real"" SA to come back.  
* **Vanishig Point**: Oh yeah, the intro kicks so much ass. At first I thought 'Hey, this sounds really much like SA..' then I figured out it features Tony, lol. The band's own vocalist is pretty damn stellar, too. This is what SA would sound like if they did progressive metal, probably.  
* **DragonForce**: I don't think there's anything better than DF when it comes to speed metal. This stuff is so over-the-top and awesome! The new vocalist does a good job, and the riffs and drums are, computerized or not, just awesome.  
* **Black Fate** I thought I was the only one who liked Black Fate! In the weekly release thread, I think the rest of the crowd were either indifferent or even deriding this for having a bad vocalist (iirc). I didn't personally make the link between this and Roy Khan, but now that you mention it, holy hell they sound alike! Now I like it even more. Incidentally, the link is another one of the 'Topic' uploads, meaning it's unavailable outside the US. I couldn't find an alternative video for *In Your Eyes*, but I've listened to *Lines in the Sand* repeatedly for a month now.  
* **Ninth Circle**: Mixed feelings about this one. I like the short opera parts, but the rest doesn't really do it for me.  
* **Epica**: As I've probably mentioned at least twice already, I'm less fond of how aggressive this album is compared to their other stuff. I know most people either tolerate or appreciate the growling, but I'm kinda wondering why the songwriters decided to take this turn with the latest album. It's almost as if Simone isn't the band's main vocalist any more. You say it showcases all their strong points, but to me it's more like they *forgot what their strong points are*. END RANT THOUGH.  
* **MindMaze**: I'm a sucker for female rock voices. MindMaze sounds pretty amazing. Not really like what is usually posted on this sub (which is a good thing, variation is good). Great riffs, too. Haven't got much more to say, the stuff is amazing and I don't think anyone will argue with that.  
* **Kamijo**: ""Bitch I'm fabulous"". I've gotta admit, this shit sounds pretty amazing. The intro is nothing short of stellar, and the interlude at 3:something is coolio. I can't really get over how the entire video's purpose is to act as a medium for the vocalist to show everyone just how fabulous he is. Hahaha... Whatever. I guess I should be happy that power metal has a ""pop"" status in Japan, nothing wrong with spreading good culture."
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Can't say I agree with most of your list, and Outloud seems completely out of left field.  I'm also a little disappointed to not see Noble Beast on your list.  I haven't listened to Ninth Circle, I'll have to check them out. I'd like to give a more in depth dicussion, but I have a friend in town(From Japan actually) and I won't have much time for discussion. "
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","&gt;Babymetal over Equilibrium"
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Any album that still has ~~people~~ elitists talking about it and complaining about it nine months after it came out is doing something right. Besides, what's wrong with a bit of variety? "
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","And what's wrong with a sense of humour too (got to have some for being a power/metal fan amarite..). Nice to see someone put BM on their list, I guarantee there are loads of folk with that on their list like a guilty secret they dont want to admit! "
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Not complaining about Babymetal, I've listened to it plenty, I just [fucking love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7fAWQlMq8) Erdentempel"
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","I just wish it were a bit heavier. I have *Sagas* in my top 10 albums of all time, and that's because it's so heavy and Helge's vocals were so much more aggressive. *Erdentempel* was a bit too atmospheric at times for my taste."
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","I think both albums are awesome, and I cannot agree more on your statement about BABYMETAL. I think BABYMETAL have injected the metal genre as a whole with a new lease on life by just doing something different. (That, and they put on one hell of a live show, having seen them twice this year)

Here is to another year of great Power Metal and BABYMETAL getting all the elitist's panties in a bunch for a little longer xD"

"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Yay Galneryus made it in. But only #20? Whatever. "
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Do you really like it that much? "
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","It's not their best, but it's one of the highlights of this year for me. Granted, I haven't listened to a lot of power metal albums in 2014 but I have given considerable attention to the ones I've listened to, and out of those Vetelgyus is the one that grew most on me. "
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","I'll give it another chance."
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Yeah, feeling iffy on you including Outloud as #1 on a power metal list.  Very iffy.  Lack of Noble Beast and Freedom Call is insanely questionable, as well.  Oh well.  Seems like I really have to check out Ne Obliviscaris."
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","i'm not going to criticize your opinions, but i will say this may be the only time i've ever seen anyone compliment kamijo based on *variety*. as much as i love lareine, and as moderately-listenable as versailles is, his solo career is just more of what he's been doing for the past 15 odd years imo.  "

I don't mean to dump a ton of links, but all those tracks are from the same album. About 1/3 of the album is vastly different than most Europower you'll ever heard, and even within the album itself, there's a lot of variety (mostly because this is a compilation of singles and B-sides with only a few new songs). "
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Definitely putting stuff on here on my list of stuff to check out. But any list that doesn't say something about pillars of power metal like Freedom Call, Gamma Ray, Edguy, Sabaton, Primal Fear, HammerFall, Iced Earth (to a degree), Iron Savior (maybe Unisonic considering who's in it) to name but a few, even in passing is very unusual. I'm interested in what you thought of these and why they were excluded. "
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","I mean, it's not like people were raving about Gamma Ray, Edguy, Primal Fear, Hammerfall, Iced Earth, or Iron Savior. They're big names, but they also put out mediocre-to-decent albums this year. Freedom Call had the best release of those bands you listed, but I still can't see myself ever listening to *Beyond* any more than the couple plays I already gave it. I think Sabaton gets extremely tedious to listen to after a while (they're a great live band though). As far as Unisonic goes, the album wasn't bad by any means, but it also wasn't particularly excellent in any way. Even MMC only mentioned a couple of the bands on your list.

Why would I mention those bands for the sake of mentioning them? As for the ""pillars"", I had both Sonata Arctica and DragonForce in my top 5 power metal albums of the year, so it's not like I was intentionally snobbing the big-name bands."
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","I haven't listened to most of these, so it'll take me a while to plow through them. I did check out Scar Symmetry on a whim (mostly to see what ""melodic death metal"" is) and I'm very glad I did. 

A bit surprised though very pleased to see SA make it so high on many 2014 lists. 

Seeing the love Falconer's album is getting, I'm surprised I don't see it here, but I never really loved them as much as other people myself. 

I probably (definitely) would have had Sabaton and Noble Beast in my tops (and the more I listen to Noble Beast the more I hate you for not including them), but to each their own I guess. "
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Can I protest that we put Triosphere on number one? Though I did expect to absolutely hate Outloud, Triosphere just fucking killed it this time around."
"UnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014","Depending on your definition of power metal, that's something that you can do yourself. It's not as if this list adds credence to any of these bands. "
"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)",""
"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)","Normally, I'll shy away form live recordings, but the definitive version of this song for me is still the [live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjpPBPlp414) from ""For the Sake of Revenge"". The crowd chanting ""Run away!"" Is much more powerful than the band singing backup."
"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)","I don't understand ""shying away"" from live versions.  Thats how the song is supposed to sound.  If a band's live version is significantly worse than the studio version its a sign of a bad band. 

I'm at the point where I almost can't listen to an Iron Maiden studio album because they are so much better live. "
"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)","To me a studio album and a live setting (either in person or a live album) are two separate things, and neither is the 'proper' one. If a band is able to put out fantastic albums, but they're terrible live, it's a sign to me only that they're able to do a great job in the studio, and don't do nearly so well live. I don't see the point in not enjoying a good album due to the group not being able to perform it live."
"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)","&gt;  Iron Maiden... much better live...

O___O
"
"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)","what does that mean?"
"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)","Bruce might not be terrible, but I always have to stop watching at the guitar solos. Janick has had a terrible impact on that band. "
"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)","Bruce is just getting old, he can't help that. He's still solid and his stage presence is second to none though. As for Janick, hes just going to be Janick.  I think we all know he is just in the band still because they felt bad kicking him out when H came back. 

I still take just about any Bruce area live track up to about 2006 over the studio tracks.  Especially anything from the 80's.  Every track on Beast Over Hammersmith is perfect. Phantom of the Opera and Hallowed Be Thy Name are absurdly good on that recording. "
"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)","The others play badly since he joined is what I meant. I don't mind that he's the crazy cooky guy, but the other two are sloppy and disinterested as fuck and I can't stand it."

"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)","I'm so glad I discovered Sonata Arctica when I did because if this was the first thing I heard from them, I would've never given them a second chance.

Those old albums (everything up to TDoG) still gives me tons of nostalgia, but I just hate what they've become over the past 5ish years."
"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)","So too much Kraken rhum and a credit card in the middle of the night and I ended up buying this crappy album. Turns out that it's not all bad after all. I didn't realize how much the pitch shift would make a difference, but now I can sing along to almost all the songs. So... I guess it's not a worthless album after all.

"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)","Anyone else think SA should maybe get a new vocalist? I know the original Ecliptica was heavily edited, but here it seems like he just can't do it. 

[inb4 blashpemy] Nobody complained when Tolkki did it with Stratovarius. "
"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)","Depite Elias being a reasonably good guitarist, I think they need a guitarist who's more willing to push for a more prominent role in the band , sort of like Jani did.

Pasi I'm not sure, but I like Henrik and Tommy's contributions. Elias is doing okay but still seems to not have enough prominence in his guitar role.

Most of my issues with the new music aren't related to vocals, drums, keys or bass. They're all good, but Elias on guitar is more often than not just chugging along, no interesting riffs (seriously, on pariah's child basically the only prominent riff that isn't a power chord chug is at the start of Wolves Die Young and running lights), only a bit of soloing (the lower soloing amount I am okay with, but when the guitar seems boring it sort of takes away from the songs, since metal music requires well thought-out guitar tracks due to their prominence)

I'm not going back to the ""bring back Jani"" crap, since people have been over that for years, but Elias seems bored in the newer songs. Needs some more interesting stuff to play."
"Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon (15th Anniversary Edition)","NW and SA both have the same problem: the songwriter plays keyboards and likes layered arrangements over guitar."

"Most uncharacteristic song by your favorite bands?","Wow, amazing. Thank you so much for that."
"Most uncharacteristic song by your favorite bands?","[**Falconer - Wake Up**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U7g5RsWcF0) from *Grime vs. Grandeur*. It's already a very non-Falconer album, accentuated by the fact that this song is about rock and roll and stuff like that. It's not even got Mathias, which I guess describes a quarter of their albums, but I've listened to this song on shuffle and not even realized it was Falconer.

[**HammerFall - 666 - The Enemy Within**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf1autcTMIQ) from *Infected*. HammerFall do not often sing about Satan. Okay, well actually everything is else is pretty much par for the course for HammerFall, but they're a pretty homogeneous band. Honorable mention for [My Sharona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-SFWc0dGfE), but it's a cover so I don't know if it should count.

**[Kiuas - Of Love, Lust and Human Nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d19JIxgiZE)** from *Lustdriven*. Now, Kiuas' sound doesn't really vary much, but I think this song is least like the others. It has the whispery stuff at the beginning which sounds like it belongs in a Disturbed song, not a Kiuas one.

**[Alestorm - Death Throes of the Terrorsquid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TKyNTwD3Yk)** from *Back Through Time*. A power metal song with growls and breakdowns? That's pretty unusual on its own. This song is pretty much lyrically congruent with everything else that Alestorm has done, but as far as the music goes, it's very different. Honorable mention for [Hangover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5P5Tz3VH94)."
"Most uncharacteristic song by your favorite bands?","Musically, I'd go with Trail of Broken Hearts by DragonForce. While they'd done power ballads before and since, this one comes off as trying too hard, with the excessively dramatic lyrics and the indulgent synthesizers, and it's easily my least favorite song of theirs, almost totally at odds with everything else they've done. Luckily, they cleaned up their act with the next one on Ultra Beatdown.

Lyrically, I'd go with Seasons, also by DragonForce. The music is on par with their usual stylings, the lyrics make it, fundamentally, a break-up song. It's also lyrically different in that the lyrics have a fairly clear (if metaphor-laden) meaning, but they've since done some stuff that's not just a Markov chain derived from a DnD manual."

"Most uncharacteristic song by your favorite bands?","I don't know if it counts, but Soul of a Vegabond by Stratovarius is very riff heavy compared to their other songs. Hell, the 2 elements albums in general are pretty different from Stratovarius's usual stuff."

"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Hi all! So last year I was lucky enough to recieve vocal training from Damnation Angels singer/youtube machine PelleK and  recently decided that I want to seriously pursue a career in Power Metal as a vocalist. I'd love some constructive criticism/song suggestions from people who love the genre!

Website: http://michaeleastwoodmusic.com/

Power Metal forever \m/"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Already like you more than PelleK so you've got that going for you. Good stuff.

Suggestions? Anything by Symphony X. Maybe Electric Messiah?"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Wow man - this is incredibly kind - I haven't listened much to Symphony X (I'm working towards them) but I've been listening to Allen/Lande a lot lately and dig his voice so hopefully I'll be able to put out some stuff by them soon :) - Again, thank you!"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","I would definitely be interested in hearing some Allen/Lande covers. If you can imitate/cover two of the best voices in metal you have my full support."
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","First off - Love your name &amp; Secondly to announce that I will in fact be covering  ""Where have the Angels gone"" in the next month with fellow youtuber Rob Lundgren, I'm super excited as I think that our different style voices will gel this song nicely ^_^"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","There is power in your voice that's for sure. You need to cover Lost Horizon that's how it goes around here. You are outperforming your vocal teacher. Keep the good work."
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Haha, it is the Holy Grail of metal singing - I can do it but not to a nice tone, so once I can nail it with a warm tone I'll put it up - Thank you for the encouragement!"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Whoa, I have watched your covers before (I search YouTube for Falconer vocal covers every now and then).

Yes, you are 100x better than PelleK (I'm interested in hearing about how he teaches considering he has a lot of flaws with his own technique). Really like the tone of your voice.

This is good stuff! "
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Thanks so much man! Yer I'm hoping to do Mindtraveller, Long gone by &amp; possibly portals of light in the next year :) - I really think I am nowhere near his level though haha...we did a year together where we would skype monthly and he would just pick out things I could do better etc :) - It was more so the belief he inspired me to go with that have made me what I am now - And shaped where I'm headed :) "
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","I'm in the process of potentially moving to Stockholm and looking forward to finding a vocal teacher there. I completely forgot that people do these lessons and stuff over Skype.

Once I move and have a bit more privacy (in an apartment right now, can't record at home), I want to start recording too. *You've* inspired me; this is great, great stuff."
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","This is so awesome man! I'm keen to hear your stuff ^_^ Feel free to hit me up anytime for a skype chat too!"

"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Thanks a bunch bro ^_^ - Looking forward to it!"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","I listened to your power metal videos because the one you linked is awesome.  You are great. I'd give you more constructive criticism but I'm not an expert on vocals.  I just know I like it. I'd like to see you cover Colours of my World by Vision Divine."
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Appreciate it so much man! And that's ok, as long as it sounds good that's enough for most people :) - I really loved ""the perfect machine"" the album, so maybe something off that would be cool too - I'll check that song now \m/"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Update - It's a great song!"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Hey bud sounds great! Just one little bit of criticism (nothing to do with your voice). 

Tighten up the camera shot. Your hand movements make me feel kind of awkward and distracts from the song a bit. Other than that, well done!"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Yer man I completely agree - I need a better camera to be honest haha...the one I bought promised full 1080p HD, yet it doesn't deliver :( 

I'll probably get a nice one later in the year, but I appreciate the comment man!"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","I like your Falconer cover.  Your voice reminds me of Mathias Blad.  You have some room for improvement, so keep up lessons and practice.  Maybe start looking for a band?  There are a lot of guitar players out there, but most can't sing."
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Yer I agree - this is only the beginning! I really love Mathias voice so I take that as a massive compliment! - Yer I'd love to get a live band but unfortunately, Power metal is not very popular in Australia :( "
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Yeah, but you have Black Majesty"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","They are indeed awesome - but unfortunately in Melbourne so I don't see them so much...I think if I moved there I could find a band easier but ideally, I'm hoping to move to find a band in Europe and move there instead :)"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","A bit of criticism if you're interested: this is just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt. I'm a classical singer, not much to do with power metal but I think some things apply.

There are just two things I would say: when you go for the high notes, try not to tense your jaw, and try to keep your larynx low. Instead, try to darken the vowels a bit and open your mouth. You can definitely get more power if your larynx is lower because it allows for more resonance.

Otherwise good job!"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","No way man - This is GREAT! Classical/Theatre/Opera singers know what they're doing and I REALLY appreciate it cause I think my technique isn't as hot as it could be :)

I'll try to work this into my practise and focus on it!"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","In that case I would definitely recommend taking some classical technique lessons.

Classical singing is (IMO) the healthiest technique there is. It's all about relaxing your voice to unleash its maximum power. A good singer can sing over a symphonic orchestra and still be heard without hurting himself.

Singing can be dangerous, and without proper technique your risk of damaging your vocal cords. That being said, it doesn't have the grittiness you get from metal singers. But I think there is a way to find a balance between rock singing and classical, something that sounds great with a power metal band but that doesn't hurt your voice.

Anyway that's just how I see it. Plenty of my favorite metal singers don't have anything close to a classical technique, and it always amazes me how they can sing after so many years of screaming.

Good luck!!"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Yer I have been trying to get lessons with this opera singer but he's too busy - I will try to find something else nearby, but ultimately that would be the goal!

Yer I agree and that would be wonderful...I'm working on improving little by little in order to not harm my voice long term (it's something I regularly worry about) so hopefully it can strengthen and grow normally :)

Haha, yes I often wonder how Hansi Kursch can still sing after all these years but there you go! Thanks for the replies man, you're epic!"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Also, if you don't mind me asking, how old are you?"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Haha not at all bro - 21 :)"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Okay, you look a bit younger. 21 is a good age for singing. But you voice will change a lot, it won't fully mature until you're in your 30's. Just be careful! If you're doing something at it hurts, tenses or grates, stop and try to figure out a way to not do that. I can't stress how important vocal health is!"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Haha, I'll take that as a compliment ;) - But yer I know very much to be careful...and I think at present with what I'm doing I give myself enough room to grow without overworking/damaging my vocal cords - I often ""tense"" my vox so I'll endeavour not to do so in future - Appreciate it man, seriously - the last thing I want is to be unable to sing after all this training!"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Isn't that what happened to the guy from Dragonforce? Just blew his vocal cords to shit?"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Apparantly he left due to ""insurmountable differences of musical opinion"" - And is apparently working on new stuff...I'm not 100% sure - I just don't want it to happen to me!"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Wow - I'm blown away by everyone's kind words! Seriously can't thank each one of you enough for the feedback - It's hard to find people who love the genre sometimes (especially here in Aus!) so I appreciate it greatly! This is really just the start for me, I've been properly singing for just over a year but I think the future is very exciting and I can't wait to see where it leads!

If anyone wants to collab/talk metal just swing me a message on my Facebook account (https://www.facebook.com/michaeleastwoodmusic) and for those asking about my band here's the link; there's only 2 songs with me currently, but we are working on a full length album this year: https://www.facebook.com/pages/InnerDream/64105666297

"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Much like the others, I am impressed by what I saw.

Your cover of Elegantly Broken was superb.

In terms of criticism, I felt like perhaps you held back a little bit on the elongated notes in your earlier uploads. In the Seasons cover, however, you showed progress in that regard. Considering that the 2-3 month period between those uploads, which is a significant portion of your short training experience, you are working your way through this already.
*Disclaimer - I have no idea what I am talking about.

All things considered, you are well on your way. Having more power metal here in Australia is *music to my ears*."

"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","I'm also in Brisbane.
Have you found much of scene for power metal around these parts, or is it generally a collective of various metal genres?
I know there have been a few PM bands that have toured here, though I've managed to miss all of them."
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","So sick man! I don't really think there's much of a scene for Power metal unfortuantely...It seems that metalcore and similar genre's rule our music scene...it just lacks melody for me and often is just noise (just my opinion) - Judas Priest/Dragonforce are playing in a few weeks and I'm soooo keen- If you end up at the gig give us a buzz and we can meet up/have a drink :D"
"New Power Metal singer looking for some feedback","Who knows, maybe you'll be part of the power metal revolution here, wouldn't that be something?

I'd love to go to the concert... Though I can't. I didn't miss the other bands by choice, health problems keep me doing much of anything right now. Still, maybe some day down the line."

"Circus Metal?","I'm just wondering if any of you can think of songs or albums that have that carnival, circus, or show vibe to them like Pride Of Creation by Edguy (plus a lot of the stuff Tobias does for Avantasia), My Name Is Monster by Lordi, and Scaretale (along with the rest of Imaginaerum) by Nightwish."
"Circus Metal?","Not exactly power metal, but check out Unexpect and Diablo Swing Orchestra. I always get a sort of ""circus"" vibe from them. Maybe because it's just chaotic/avant-garde stuff."
"Circus Metal?","The obvious one is ""[Majesty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9WJh6ioEPQ)"" by Blind Guardian. I can't think of anything else off the top of my head right now."

"Circus Metal?","I'm not sure if its what your looking for but Arcturus' La Masquerade Infernale is basically just deranged circus music.

"Circus Metal?","Only one I know is [Helloween - The Dark Ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHJin6xn20Q)

And you mention Edguy, but don't mention [Mysteria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X7vc0ChS_s), so I'm assuming that *""Welcome to the Freakshow!""* is not sufficient. Honestly, everything that Edguy does is somehow clown-related, I'm certain"
"Circus Metal?","I would say Crack the Riddle to continue with the Helloween theme. Maybe Kill It because it flows from Crack the Riddle."
"Circus Metal?","Not PM, but check out [Haken's Aquarius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieeM5iUwhNs). A lot of Devin Townsend's music also has a circus-y vibe to it, especially on [Deconstruction.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr-t4aL1anw)"
"Circus Metal?","I'm on my phone so I can't link any, try out Beyond Twilight. Both definitely have that vibe but in particular the title track from The Devil's Hall of Fame. It is also worth checking out their demo Lurking Fantasia.  Also check out Evil Masquerade - Welcome to the show. Royal Hunt also heads into that territory but song names escape me. "
"Circus Metal?","Sonata Arctica's Cloud Factory might count.  The opening rift and the breakdown in the middle fit."
"Circus Metal?","How about the subreddit /r/circusmetal ?

Edit: Plus a lot of Finntroll"
"Circus Metal?","Not power metal, but [Tool - Intermission/Jimmy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUDgtt-f5h0)"
"Circus Metal?","If you listen to a lot of Progressive Metal, you'll hear the circus metal element probably more pronounced than in Power Metal. This is because they experiment more with chromaticism and rhythm typical of ""circus"" or ""carnival"" vibe. 
Andromeda, Circus Maximus, Dream Theater, Haken, Shadow Circus, Shadow Gallery, Suspyre, Tool, etc.
""Enigma Machine"" - Dream Theater
""Fatal Tragedy"" - Dream Theater
""Celestial Elixir"" - Haken
"
"Circus Metal?","Also, ""Fall of the Eternal Winter"" by Twilight Force in one of my fav PM albums of 2014 has a random circus melody at the end of it. "
"Circus Metal?","My band is more or less a ""circus metal band""

Catoptric Controtions probably being the best example of this-

"Circus Metal?","Not power metal but check out Devin Townsend's Deconstruction album. Has a very dark carnival/circus feel to it. It is an extremely heavy album."
"Circus Metal?","[Darth Vegas!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8MR2fGnQw) It's more on the Avant-Garde side of metal, and not Power Metal at all, but it's definitely Circus Metal."
"Circus Metal?","[Bal-Sagoth - Blood Slakes the Sand at Circus Maximus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JsxGP1wJ2U#t=62)"
"Circus Metal?","[deleted]"
"Circus Metal?","""Theater of Pain"" by Emerald Sun seems to something that fits the description."
"Circus Metal?","Thematically, you can't go wrong with the new A.C.T album Circus Pandaemonium. It's softer prog metal though so likely not what you are really after."

"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/21/15)","Symphonic metal has a bit of a ""hip"" status, so I feel like a lot of these bands sound overly commercial, just picking a female singer even though she doesn't have a voice suited for metal.

I generally don't care about lyrics, because music is a terrible medium for telling stories. I usually can't make out what they're singing for an entire song, rendering the overall lyrics hazy at best. Most of the lyrical themes bore me. For example, while I greatly enjoy fantasy novels, fantasy-based lyrics end up being cheesy and generic. You can't tell a good fantasy story in such a short duration. And if it's not fantasy, then it's some kind of sentiment that I don't give a crap about. Singing about hardships, negative emotions? Fuck that, I listen to PM to get cheered up. Some other kind of convoluted meaning? Fuck that, I'm not in the mood to analyze your shit by looking up the lyrics."
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/21/15)","I think i t depends on the band. Someone like Hammerfall is a band I listen to when I just want to be happy, but a band like Brainstorm, I'll listen to the lyrics because they sound different from the norm.

That and any band that goes out of their way to make a story that's halfway understandable (Avantasia) gets lyrical attention from me.

*****  
###Fazermint's recommendation of the week  
One release really stands out this week, and that one is **Wind Rose**. The preview song ""Rebel and Free"" is basically power folk, sporting fast and nice instrumentation and choir-style vocals. Specific instrumental segments sound like they were taken from a Lost Horizon song... I can't quite put my finger on which one. Listen to 1:00 - 1:05 and you'll see what I mean. I'm curious whether this song is indicative of the entire album... we'll see. Good stuff.

*****  
[When I take over the weekly release threads for /u/UnlostHorizon](https://mrcobbsclass.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/olympic-relay-pivot.gif)"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/2 -2/8)","No wrestling gif? Leave the hall!

**Darking** - Nothing special, a bit too repetitive. Have no clue what the singer is saying, too thick of an accent.

**Lujuria** - Vanilla Hard rock, with some rough vocals and banging riffs, the use of the organ adds some variation to the song. Good solo performance, ok I'll stop it.

**Wildpath** - Starts slowly almost with the inception [bwong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2jUhnCU9iA), it goes onto a groovy riff and then the female vocals kicks in and the song falls apart. Imo, this song would be better if we had Russel Allen roughy vocal style. The rest of the song just doesn't do anything for me.

**Wind Rose** - Wind Rose is a bad name for a band. The song starts pretty poorly but then it slides in a very well done chant that took me by surprise and the song evolves into something much more special. Very good song, give it a shot. The 1:00 - 1:05 segment is definitely reminiscent of Lost Horizon. My biggest gripe with the song is not the slow start, its the retarded sudden halt at 3:20, just... why? It's so out of place.

**Yesterdays Saints** - These intros man, they suck. Once we get past the initial overused thrashy riff, the song is not that bad. However, this has to be used one of the poorest uses of double bass in drumming, just because you can go fast, doesn't mean you should. At the 3 minute mark the drummer finally gains some sense and drops a nice blast beat only to lose his mind once again. All in all kind of a weird song.

**Lykaion** - Heavy Lullabies?? Are you serious? Well this put me into a sleeping state. Boring. Very boring.

**Hagbard** - Kind of a cool song ruined by the horrible rough vocals, their just bad.

**Acero Letal** - [Yeah! Fuck Yeah!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Soz617b8xNY). Old school speed metal raping my ears 200 mph, now that's what I'm talking. The song is too long for it's own good but boy does it kick in like a mule on steroids. Very fun song. If you're into good ol' speed metal, this one is for you.

Typo, or commentary? Let's try to stay objective here!"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/2 -2/8)","aaaah. Typo! And that's not the first time I do that! Dammit."

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/2 -2/8)","Decided to give a listen to this week's music, here's my thoughts along with ratings of some odd nature (also in reverse order listed for a reason I don't wish to edit at this time)

**Acero Letal:** Couldn't understand a word that was said, but damn if I didn't enjoy it. Felt it dragged on for too long, but it stayed entertaining throughout. *Worth multiple listens.*

**Hagbard:** I enjoyed this. Could have done with less of the growling as I enjoyed the clean vocals more. Although, it's not indistinguishable growls, so I approve there. Otherwise, *standard folk metal.*

**Lykaion:** Was not a fan of this one. From the intro alone I felt it would be a letdown, and it didn't disappoint there. It felt like music that I'd skip on my ipod and then wonder why it was there in the first place. *Not Recommended*

**Yesterdays Saints:** I got a bit of a Nevermore vibe when the vocals came in clean and near the end. Intro could have been shortened if not cut out. Not bad otherwise. *Worth a listen*

**Wind Rose:** The intro threw me off as I was expecting a softer folk song. I've seen plenty of bands like this (kilts, facepaint, songs of glory) but it's entertaining here so I'll let it slide. *Perfect song for D&amp;D or LARP, good song otherwise.*

**Wildpath:** Female vocals, was not expecting that. Guess I should have with the sound of the band. Nothing really stood out here. Just middle of the pack Symphonic Metal. *6 out of 10*

**Lujuria:** Ugh, that album cover...what is this 1981 and the Scorpions? Kidding aside, these guys rock! Heavy Metal done right! Only thing not making this a perfect song is the lyrics not being in English, but this is damn good nonetheless. *My recommendation of the week.*

**Darking:** I had high hopes walking into this one. With the tag ""Epic Heavy Metal"" it's hard not to. Bass solo was nice to hear, but the guitar solo felt as if it was just ""there"". I'm sure the whole album is a worthwhile listen, as the idea behind this song/video makes me think this is a concept album. *Interested for more of their material*

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/2 -2/8)","Winterage's [The Harmonic Passage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCXkiQGTz94&amp;x-yt-ts=1422579428&amp;x-yt-cl=85114404) drops tomorrow as well.  Preview sounds a lot like Luca Turilli's Rhapsody/late era RoF.  Maybe it can fill the void in my heart until Symphonia Ignus Divinus finally comes out."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/2 -2/8)","Oh, holy crap. That stuff sounds incredible! That high pitched scream didn't need to be there, but the rest is divine. I'll definitely add this to ""what you may have missed last week"", next week."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/2 -2/8)","After listening to the whole thing, there are quite a few high screams that are probably only there because he can do them.  Technically impressive but unneeded.  Still, a really REALLY solid album, especially for a debut."

"Guitarists of /r/PowerMetal, what are some good pickups/gear for particular sounds?","So I'm just getting into playing electric (played classical style for years), and I was wondering what kind of gear you use to produce your favorite tones. I'm currently playing a B.C. Rich Metal Master Warlock, though I'm looking at expanding my electric collection. I'm particularly drawn to a Judas Priest or HammerFall style sound. What would be best for this? Also, for fun, feel free to list and discuss what you prefer. Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you all!"
"Guitarists of /r/PowerMetal, what are some good pickups/gear for particular sounds?","Personally I enjoy playing through passive pickups (Seymour Duncan 51) in general when compared to active pickups (EMG). Passive pick ups tend to give the guitar  a more unique sound where as you can typically make all EMGs sound the same in most guitars. Personally i own an LTD with active pickups and an Ibanez with passive pickups so I can switch between when i wanna change sounds. "
"Guitarists of /r/PowerMetal, what are some good pickups/gear for particular sounds?",":-O

Hi, guitar twin.

I also play an ESP LTD with Seymour Duncan 51s. I love it.

I'm not as good a guitarist as I am a singer or drummer but I like to mess around and pretend I know what I'm doing."
"Guitarists of /r/PowerMetal, what are some good pickups/gear for particular sounds?","It's all personal preference, and you can get a good power metal tone with a lot of variety equipment. 

Personally I find that Engl amps  have a really good modern Power Metal sound(Invader / SE). I know Hammerfall use Engl Invader both live and in studio. In general the Engl amps I have owned have had an easy to dial European power metal tone. 

I good mid output pickup like Dimazrio EVO / Activator go well with it. 

Guitar wise what ever you prefer should be okay, I'm not personally a fan of B.C. Rich non US guitars, but like I said its all preference. "
"Guitarists of /r/PowerMetal, what are some good pickups/gear for particular sounds?","Don't get too wrapped up on recommendations. Just test out different pickups, effects, etc. and choose the ones that you resonate the most with. I like Ibanez and ESP guitars, Laney and Blackstar amps, boss pedals, etc. I'm still exploring pickups though, because I've only used actives so far. "
"Guitarists of /r/PowerMetal, what are some good pickups/gear for particular sounds?","Amps are my main area of interest. I have a Vox DA15, but I know literally nothing about them."
"Guitarists of /r/PowerMetal, what are some good pickups/gear for particular sounds?","The thing about all these guitars, amps, and pedals are that there are way too many extraneous variables to objectively compare one thing to another. Your best bet is to bring your own guitar into a store and test out the amps you're thinking of. That's why pickups are hard for me to compare. "

I dig videogame music and was sharing the themesong for Civilization, Baba yetu, with a friend. She asked me which language it was in, so I went to wikipedia. When I started reading the english translation of the swahili lyrics, I knew I recognized it from somewhere - and that's where it dawned on me!

In Sabaton's song Carolean's prayer, a swedish choir is chanting a prayer - the very same one that make up the entire lyrics for baba yetu, namely ""The lord's prayer.""

Frankly, anything by Kiuas is pretty much perfect for this. They're the most aggressive power metal I know, being closer to thrash if it weren't for their awesome singing.

*****  
###Fazermint's recommendation of the week  
Not a very exciting week for Power Metal fans. For fans of folk metal with unclean vocals, **Ensiferum** seems to have pretty kick-ass instrumentation. Also, if you liked **Scanner**'s release back in January, a music video has since dropped for the title track of the album. The symphonic (power) metal enthusiast in me was excited to check out *Whyzdom* and *Lapis Lazuli*, but I found both cases to be quite uninteresting, honestly.

The new **Nightwish** single for Élan dropped yesterday, so if you haven't yet, check it out! The song is calm and beautiful, and Floor sounds fantastic. I do, however, hope for heavier and speedier tracks on the actual album. The single release had a bonus track, [Sagan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq-qQRLjEJM), which is slightly speedier. Even though these two tracks aren't really what I, and bet most of you, expect from the album, I'm still confident that the album will contain one or two hard-hitting tracks to stand above the currently known songs.

I've toyed around somewhat with the link format, putting indicative names on the links instead of calling everything a preview. Tell me which style you prefer. Also, /u/Phyralis has expressed interest in helping out with the weekly releases. I asked about it and haven't heard from him yet, but hopefully he'll join me soon.

It got more than Twilight of the Gods...and people say /r/powermetal is a BG circlejerk.
"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/16 - 2/22)","**Furor Gallico: Songs from the Earth** - To little to work with.

**Whyzdom: Symphony for a Hopeless God** - Very odd song, it's overly dramatical and actually made me feel tense, I'm not sure if that's bad or good. The song opens with its dark atmosphere and remains in the darkness for the whole 7 minutes... I like it. Overall it's a very well done song in my opinion, if you are into more poppy melody driven songs, this is not for you.

**Cyntia: Woman** - Small sample but it sounds like something coming out of a 80/90s cock rock band.

**Ensiferum: One Man Army** - YES! Ensiferum! GRAB YOUR BLOODY AXES! TO BATTLE WE RIDE!!! The song is Ensiferum undoubtly and that should be enough to tell you that it's good, fucking good. ONE MAN ARMY!!! If you are into fucking metal, this is for you!

**Svartsot: Vældet** - Decent Folk Metal, I think the vocals are really good and so are the folkloric bits.

**Masters of Disguise: The Savage and the Grace** - Huh.. After a few head scratches, it appears this band is a tribute to Savage Grace. What an odd band to pay tribute, some of the guys even played live with Savage Grace. Back to the album, it sounds like fun power/speed/heavy metal in the same vein as Savage Grace..... They even got the fucking police guy in the cover, kind of hilarious in it's own cvlt way.

**Exxplorer: Symphonies of Steel** - Oh man, fucking exxplorer, the whole album is a small unknown bag of gems. Think Manowar with a over the top voice production, less punchy guitars and a more power metal vibe. I recommend the whole album.

**Lord Fist: Green Eyleen** - Sounds like it's coming straight from the fucking 80s. Decent metal but you know, you get the taste of sickness after eating too many ambrosias (maybe you don't know), it's good but you already got so much of it that it feels tiresome.

**Lapis Lazuli: The Downfall of Humanity** - Every. Single. Symphonic. Metal. Band... Always female driven. Anyway, snooze fest song, too many boring keyboarding and special effects.

**Scanner: The Judgement** - Haven't heard Scanner in a long time, Their first album had Knoblichs voice and in comparison... I don't really like this guy. Song is ok, it's nothing special, not like I'm expecting Scanner to return and pull an album out of their ass that's as good as the first one.

What **I** may have missed last week...

**Beyond Reason: A New Reflection** - Can't make the connection, I know these guys sound like some other band but I can't fucking name it. Very good song, with a different style of riffing, very headbangable. Good controlled vocals, he doesn't go too overboard but doesn't hold himself back either. Good solo too.

**Nightwish: Élan** - Too soft, too held back, too slow. This would fit a pop rock opera a lot more than a symphonic metal album. It's a good song regardless, just not what I want from a Symphonic Metal labeled band.

**Ranger: Storm of Power** - A fucking bow to old school speed metal, a fresh perspective that adds the good ol' speed metal I love so much with a Thrashier vocal style that I believe it fits perfectly. Hey, it's not original but it's fucking fast and ends on a high note.

**Seventh Dimension: Recognition** - Finally, some progressive power that cuts the bullshit and goes straight to the juice so you don't have to peel out the whole fucking fruit. Looking at the album suggests a different path, 80 minutes of metal is way too much and I can only imagine the amount of self-indulgence and noodle wankering that can be found in the album (might not be true, I haven't heard the album). Very good song, some might not enjoy the vocal style, it's mellow and softer and if you're expecting over the top schenanigans, you're going to be disappointed. All instruments are very well done, musically and production wise. Excellent intro and great solo and surprising end.

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/16 - 2/22)","There are also few new Ensiferum songs from their new album available on spotify, so if you haven't heard them yet stop whatever you're doing right now and do it."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/16 - 2/22)","Seventh Dimension stood out to me a bit as well, and having listened to more of the album it is worthwhile checking out if you enjoyed that song."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/16 - 2/22)","It's on my checking list, the only aspect that terrifies me is the length, I think anyone agrees that an hour and 20 minutes is just too much for an album."
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/16 - 2/22)","I listened to the whole thing in one sitting. I admit there were times songs seemed to blend together due to the length, but overall it kept my attention.

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/16 - 2/22)","&gt; The symphonic (power) metal enthusiast in me was excited to check out Whyzdom and Lapis Lazuli, but I found both cases to be quite uninteresting, honestly.

Maybe it's just me, but I'm tired of seemingly every female-fronted band with even a slight gothic theme making a track about the Salem Witch Trials. I did like the sound in general though, so hopefully the rest of their album will be interesting.

&gt; For fans of folk metal with unclean vocals, Ensiferum seems to have pretty kick-ass instrumentation.

I've been told over and over to listen to Ensiferum and that was the first time I heard them. I liked it, it will go well with Amon Amarth and Tyr. There's just so much music to keep up with and so little time!"
"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/16 - 2/22)","The Ensiferum song is pretty damn good, but honestly doesn't sound like Ensiferum.  Their first few albums had a very distinct sound, so you should check out those albums.  "

"This Week in Power Metal Releases (2/16 - 2/22)","I have to agree with you this week isn't terribly exciting. I heard a few interesting songs here and there but the standout is easily the Exxplorer re-release. Telling that a thirty year old re-release I've heard before is the best release of the week, no?

"If you want more moderation, you need to decide what you want moderated.","Community members, hello. 

It has come to my attention that you would like some rule enforcement. Currently there are no rules, so adding moderators would do nothing to aid in that. I'm not instilling power into random individuals so that they can act arbitrarily. 

I have provided this thread for you to discuss some concrete, actionable rules for me to base moderation decisions around. 

After this thread has expired, I will continue to produce threads on a daily basis until a decision has been reached. 

This has been your friendly wizard SpeakMouthWords."
"If you want more moderation, you need to decide what you want moderated.","I down-voted nearly everyone's comment in this thread.  Simply put, I really do no want our subreddit to be clouded with rules.  It is not necessary.  The more rules you have, the less character there will be in the sub-reddit.  Too strict.  Just a few simple rules to help keep a community this small civilized and organized are necessary.  

1) No excessive trolling.  Trolling on its own isn't that bad.  It creates character for users and for a subreddit.  Sometimes it's fun, funny, and unoffensive.  However, when you continue the trolling past the point where people find it funny and it starts bugging people, and you do NOT stop, this is where ""excessive"" comes into play.

2)  Post only power-metal related stuff.  If it's ""this is a different genre, but I think power metal fans will appreciate it"" once-in-awhile it's fine; just do not do this often.  If it's some metalcore thing with no power metal relation, it should be removed.

3) Posts for songs should contain [Artist - Song Title] format.  The rest is up to the user posting.

If there needs to be a sub-list of what ""excessive trolling"" entails then so be it, but in terms of behavior, I think this is the only necessary rule here."
"If you want more moderation, you need to decide what you want moderated.","I think this is all we need, to be honest. Anything more is pretty silly for such a small subreddit. We are fairly self-moderating with downvotes, so aside from avoiding actual trolling and encouraging good content and posting habits, I don't feel that more rules are particularly necessary."
"If you want more moderation, you need to decide what you want moderated.","I don't think there is a need for a lot of moderation.  If you want some guidelines on posting, go ahead.  But if you choose to enforce a bunch of rules it will become an onerous task.

Reddit has downvote buttons.  They work pretty well."
"If you want more moderation, you need to decide what you want moderated.","Well people wouldn't be posting what they did today if that was 100% the case.

So might as well have a clear set of guidelines. Even if they aren't enforced it will give people more reason to downvote stuff that doesn't follow it."
"If you want more moderation, you need to decide what you want moderated.","I have a few suggestions.

1. One additional moderator. I think we need someone who is active and can respond to problems fairly quickly. Actual removals should probably be used sparingly, but we need an active liason at least.
2. Themed days were a fun idea that we picked up on our own for a few days. I'd like to see more of this, and perhaps dedicate a day out of each week where we post songs that follow a theme.
3. Use the wiki more. The depth of the genre and many users' knowledge here is far too much for just a spot in the sidebar. We could have wiki pages for the essential albums list and flesh it out a bit more.
4. As in the other comments, I'd like to see video posts be in `Artist - Song` or `Artist - Album` format. Click-bait titles are often a problem on music subreddits, luckily we haven't had too much yet since we're so small.

"If you want more moderation, you need to decide what you want moderated.","Rule 1- don't overreact and act like the sky is falling because someone wants to post particular videos you don't want. If it bothers you that much the downvote button is there for a reason. Beyond that just get over it, its not certain members responsibility to curtail to your wants and desires. "
"If you want more moderation, you need to decide what you want moderated.","Rule 5 - When posting a link to a video, say what the video is. If you post the song Land of the Free by Gamma Ray, post it as ""Land of the Free - Gamma Ray"", not just as a long winded title without the name of the song. (eg. ""This is a great Power Metal Song that everyone should listen to."") The same applies to news about artists or newsworthy Power Metal items.

Rule 5.1 - This is not to say an alternate title can't be used. When used in conjnction with the song title/band (eg. [Thunder Themed Thursday] Labyrinth - Thunder) it's fine. Although creativity is encouraged, try not to be too long winded with an alternative title."

Check the sidebar before asking a question that could be easily answered just by looking to the right of the screen.

Honestly, beyond the obvious banning of trolls and zero tolerance for aggressive users and keeping content relevant to power metal the sub sails along just fine as it is. Don't like something? Downvote and/or move along. Simple."
"If you want more moderation, you need to decide what you want moderated.","Rule 3 - Pay attention to what other users have posted. Want to post a song by an artist? (eg. Hammerfall) Take a look at the front page, even the second page before posting.

Still not sure? Use the search feature on the right hand side of the page to be certain. (This also helps out for not posting duplicate songs from bands)"
"If you want more moderation, you need to decide what you want moderated.","Rule 2 - If you've seen something (artist, song, news) posted a lot lately and not being very well received, it's best to think twice about posting more of it unless new content (that you think people will like) has shown up.

This goes hand in hand with posting content covered on the sidebar. Most people have heard stuff listed on the sidebar already, so it's not something to do all the time. If it's new and related to sidebar bands, then it's fair game to post."
"If you want more moderation, you need to decide what you want moderated.","Rule 4 - Chances are you are looking at /r/PowerMetal to find new Power Metal related music that you haven't heard before. It's best not to pan, downvote, or even just ignore stuff you haven't seen or heard before; it's more likely in your best interest to check it out.

&gt;__Viathyn__ is a Canadian [progressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_metal)/[power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_metal) metal band from [Calgary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary), [Alberta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta). Their music features a folkish 'natural' feel and themes such as the beauty of the natural world, existentialism, and storytelling.  The vocals within Viathyn's music are also more subdued than typical power metal vocal heights, which lends to the natural and existential themes of their albums.  The band's name is a play on the word '[leviathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan)', and has no true definition, but when describing the band can be defined as 'progressive, melodic, grandiose, innovative and emotional'.

Syu is phenomenal."
"So can I get some recommendations for epic guitar work?","Now I'm disappointed I have NO way of getting their music. I've been using Amazon MP3, but there isn't any Galneryus on there. And ordering CDs overseas on Amazon tends to cost me a fortune."
"So can I get some recommendations for epic guitar work?","I checked out a song by them a few minutes ago and thought ""nah, I can't do the lyrics""

This one made me not only not care about the lyrics, but my facial skin has been entirely blasted off from such epicness,  leaving only my smiling skull with chunks of flesh left behind, splattered on the back of the couch for some poor soul to find.

That was fucking amazing and thank you. "
"So can I get some recommendations for epic guitar work?","""Golden Worm"" by Winterage has my favorite guitar riff intro lately. It's so majestic it makes me think of the splendor of the infinite universe. 

Also, check out Cellador, Galneryus, Rhapsody of Fire/Luca Turilli, Pathfinder, and DragonForce for splendid guitar work. Although you might find the latter two to be ""wankery"" as some put it, but as a guitarist myself, I love them. 

If you're looking for metal outside Power Metal, I highly recommend these guitarists: Andy James, Dream Theater/John Petrucci, Jeff Loomis, Paul Wardingham, Sergey Golovin, and Theodore Ziras."
"So can I get some recommendations for epic guitar work?","Great recommendations, everyone! Stormwarrior is always a blast, and yes, I've heard some of the more famous bands here, like DragonForce and Gamma Ray. That being said, it's always great to hear some songs that slipped under your radar. Heavenly is interesting, and I've been meaning to check out Dark Moor for awhile. So does anyone have any lesser known songs or budding artists? I think Viathyn is taking the crown in that category right now. Broke my heart to see they had NO ratings on either album on Amazon MP3!"
"So can I get some recommendations for epic guitar work?","(Someone already recommended [Cellador](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG79dvSCaFk), otherwise I would have said them).

Other than Viathyn, for Canadian bands we have [Borealis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n49T3GFqbqA) which is very riff heavy but doesn't have as much guitar soloing (and also prog/power), for something really weird but interesting (they have some very interesting concept album work), there's [Antiquus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xNfVesyG3w), for something with a big focus on lyrics but also great guitar work, there's [Instanzia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flupVYEIb3Q), a Firewind-esque band [King Misfit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2snxallivNA), a very heavy epic/black/power metal mix headed by a 18-19 year old, [Primalfrost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99dsIMoVqng), a subdued, shoegazy folkish act from one guy [Sequester](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hifAkro4LLM), and a heavier band with distorted vocals but a clear PM influence [Shadowblade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcXh9Jc6fQ).

For other countries, other people are probably better for recommendations. But I think in that list you'll find something. I talked about most of the Canadian bands back [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FVIyJjIlhPLUvi_bYazi8Q6dD8TSr4J0en-cvkykWsY) if you want to see what's good/bad."

To touch on a few points brought up thus far:

**Dream Evil** - yes, we LOVE that band. A lot of the initial discussion about ""what do we want to sound like"" when the band started revolved around Dragonslayer &amp; Book of Heavy Metal

**Tempos/Ballads** - We've always been a mid-tempo band (as far as metal is concerned) and I don't really see that changing much. Sure, we've got the occasional faster song (i.e. *Kill to Die* on this album), but that's just not us. We're probably never going to be overly thrashy, overly fast.

In terms of the ""ballads""...when I'm writing vocal lines, I always try to make the choruses catchy enough to sing along on their own, or add in a bit of a ""singalong"" part. It's similar to what Hammerfall said in Metal: A Headbanger's Journey (at least I think that's the right documentary). There's a focus on the ""drinking hall singalong"" motif during the choruses that makes the live shows fun, and gives the audience a chance to participate. There's something very powerful about tons of voices singing a very simple part, and I love hearing it. "
"Lords of the Trident - Knights of Dragon's Deep","I have a question for you...

I mean, bands like Alestorm, which are basically comedy acts, are one thing (WOODEN LEG! WOODEN LEG! WOOOOOODEN LEG! I'VE GOT A WOODEN LEG! WOOOOOODEN LEG!), but it's another thing to just excrete vaguely fantasy/metal-sounding words into a microphone without any real message or story.

"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","Not sure if you've actually paid attention to Alestorms songs, but most of them do tell a story, if somewhat self-contained one. They go against giant squids, go to the future to fight space-squid, they tell about being spipwrecked.

"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","Yeah, that's like half of their songs, they do tell stories and their songs tend to be well written and cohesive but they also have their more general stuff about being a pirate and life at the sea and then they have stuff like: Wooden Leg, Wenches &amp; Mead, Surf Squid Warfare, Scraping the Barrel, Midget Saw, and a few more. These are all goofy songs but they aren't bad some of them are actually quite ingenious, for example: Scraping the Barrel is Bowes showing the middle finger to anyone who thinks that their music is just Running Wild rip offs; Surf Squid Warfare is about traveling to the future to save the world from undead space squids... yeah it's fucking stupid but it sure trumps on all generic fantasy non stories about dragons swords and magic."

Put &lt;Band Name - Track Title&gt; in the post title, and link directly to the song. (Preferably on YouTube.) If the title on YouTube is crappy/in the wrong format/has superfluous text, fix it.

Commentary goes in a comment! Don't talk about how great your song is and then never refer to its name. Don't make a self post with a link to the song.

Don't link into a playlist, unless you're intending to share to the whole album. Even then, full album links are preferred. (It's always crappy when part of the playlist gets taken down.)"
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","As long as you get the band and title in there, I don't mind a tad bit of commentary. Sometimes it varies it up. But those that don't post a title or band are awful clickbait."
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","Cheese =/= bad automatically! Hell, it can lead to huge success. Look at Manowar, they're quite popular even though they're telling tales of warriors deeds. Alestorm, while not as cheesy as some, telling about pirates life is cheesy to a degree. Plus, they seem to be more popular than the seemingly more serious Swashbuckle (though given that Alestorm doesn't go full-on death-growl like Swashbuckle, that might help them reach a wider audience).

Hell, large amounts of cheese can be fun. Look at Gloryhammer, they're basically your fantasy-based power metal taken to to it's natural escalation. It's like those fantasy novels that tell an epic tale of glory. It can be fun and relaxing to read something more light-hearted in tone after reading something heavier for a while.

Sure, if you don't have a certain amount of joy in doing cheesy PM, then it can suck. You have to have fun doing it and yet be at least believable in the context of your songs. For an example of trying to be cheesy (at least seemingly) take a look at Kontrust's cover of Hey DJ! First of all, the outfits don't fit the theme of the song very well, even if they are the bands typical stage outfit. Also, the woman seems to be using auto-tune to purposefully to peak the mic and it sounds annoying. Their own song Just Propaganda works better since for one the woman isn't peaking the mic like in Hey DJ, and the visuals match with the bands style and the song."
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","I think you'd struggle to find power metal fans having a problem with cheesiness.

It ruins your music. It adds NOTHING. Unclean vocals is not characteristic of Power Metal. It is a gimmick. Just because you can and everyone else does it, it doesn't mean you should do it.

PM with unclean vocals is FINE. Just promote your music as ""Power / Death Metal"" or whatever, so that I know to stay the hell away from it.

EDIT: Jimmies were rustled."
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","Harsh vocals add so much. "
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it doesn't add anything. And harsh vocals aren't a gimmick. They're a cornerstone of half the subgenres in metal. If you haven't noticed, plenty of people here like bands like [Children of Bodom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv-oswyPzak), [Crimson Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJh7fSr0cRc), [Scar Symmetry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mebSi4PDC34). While those bands aren't necessarily power metal, you can't listen to those songs and tell me that clean vocals would be an adequate replacement. Harsh vocals bring something new to the table, and they bring an element of anger and intensity that so many power metal bands are lacking nowadays. "
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","Since when is Power Metal supposed to be angry? I always figured that the core of the genre was to be uplifting and motivating. Harsh vocals convey anger, like you say, and that's why it sucks in a genre that is supposed to convey happiness, courage, and serenity.

It's just an opinion."
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","Harsh vocals aren't always necessarily meant to convey anger. [Equilibrium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yom8nNqmxvQ) and [Ensiferum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0CRm94ObE). Both bands' lyrics are very similar in theme to power metal, and both could be considered uplifting. Harsh vocals are just an additional way to convey intensity and urgency in a song.

Even with that mind, power metal doesn't have to be uplifting. Sonata Arctica and Kamelot are the prime examples of this. Power metal doesn't *have to* convey happiness, courage, and serenity. Bands that use harsh vocals to be uplifting in melodeath are aplenty (Amon Amarth, Wintersun, Gladenfold), but even the power metal bands that use it for anger, depression, hatred, etc... have every right to do so. The whole mentality of ""power metal is supposed to be happy and cheesy"" is what pigeonholes the subgenre. When Blind Guardian makes a song that isn't ultra-happy, people don't go around declaring it as ""not power metal"", so why is harsh vocals given the same treatment? Just because it doesn't sound happy doesn't mean it can't still be power metal. I'm not saying harsh vocals are a key ingredient in power metal by any means, but it certainly doesn't negate or belittle their music in any way, unless your own personal opinion dictates so. 

The way I see it is this: if clean vocals are the main source of vocals in the band, then they can still claim to be power metal (provided the instrumentation is suitable, which is usually not an issue). 

I've always preferred my power metal to be depressing and more grounded in reality; lyrical themes like those of Fairyland, Rhapsody, and Twilight Force can only be used so much before I start to get tired of them. At least with Sonata Arctica, Kamelot, Triosphere, and Cain's Offering the lyrical themes are something I can relate to a bit more. And all those are undeniably power metal (Triosphere is prog/power, but who cares). Just because it's not happy, doesn't mean it's not power metal."
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","That does put things in perspective for me. I mean, I'm on one extreme end of the harsh vocal appreciation spectrum, so I rarely think about how others experience it. My main gripe is with bands who use harsh vocals *just because it's a thing*, sounding terrible in otherwise decent music. I really feel that Elvenking's music quality is lower because of their random bursts of unclean vocals, but I'm probably in the minority there.

Regardless of how uplifting the instrumentation may be, bands like Equilibrium and Ensiferum will still feel like an angry bunch to me, because of the harsh vocals. That's just how I experience it. As a timid person who avoids confrontation in real life, I certainly don't want people yelling at me while I listen to music. Hence my bias towards happy PM."
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","Yeah I love melodic death, traditional death, folk, thrash, and some black metal as well.

Melodic death metal bands like Bodom, and Kalmah are among my favorites.

To add more to Fazermint's original comment, I think harsh vocals are ok in power metal if they work within the context of the song, see [Kamelot - March of Mephisto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV_94f3CsPQ) or [Rhapsody of Fire - Reign of Terror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nItx9Rkyc8)"
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","I agree, harsh vocals *can* work if it fits the song. Reign of Terror is a masterpiece, I'll give you that.

It may sound like I contradict myself. Yes, I find harsh vocals unpleasant to the ear, but on rare occasions I find them tolerable (such as in Reign of Terror). My complaint is that most of the time it's just so out of place, as if bands googled ""how to maek metalz"" and grunting was the top search result and they went with it."
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","Could you please give some examples of bands or songs that do this?

(Genuinely interested in what you're talking about)"
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","A lot of folk/power bands do this. Like Elvenking. I really love most of their stuff but it would be so much better without the growling that they throw in at some points. I like folk music, so I'm pretty disappointed that almost every folk band use harsh vocals, which apparently has become characteristic of the genre (hence my gimmick remark, no single folk song has harsh vocal and it isn't a necessity in metal).

An example of regular power metal that does this is [Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrg4PybSgd0). Just... ugh.

And the only thing that keeps Sabaton - Twilight of the Thunder God to be perfect is that one segment with harsh vocals. I know the source is Amon Amarth, but if you're gonna make a non-harsh cover, why not do it completely?

Just one man's opinion, though."
"/r/PowerMetal Zero Fucks Saturday (2/28/15)","Folk metal is inspired by folk music; it's not like you found electrical guitars in folk music either. Clean vocals are rare for folk metal though and it's a shame, but harsh vocals, in my opinion, doesn't necessarily make the piece bad."

And they certainly cannot classify as death metal. "

"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","im not really a fanboy of them but they have been around a long time and seem really popular, just wondering temple of shadows seems to be on par with several of the sidebar suggestions to me.

im just now starting to get in to the actual power metal fandom, so please let me know the consensus."
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","Its a touchy subject that's been discussed ad nauseam actually. 

When the list was voted on not enough votes went to Angra. When talk of a list revision pops up it always devolves into arguing so SMW has left it as is. 

I will say. I did nominate Rebirth for the original list. But my cries went unheard. "
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","ohh, i did not know the list was a vote, i figured it was more like an evolving and expanding list.  interesting, thats unfortunate."
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","I think I joined this sub after the Essentials list was created.

I would've thrown a shitfit during the thing if Angra wasn't getting enough votes."
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","yeah, pretty surprising.  i didnt know it was a vote..."
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","Angra definitely deserves a spot on any essential metal list, not only power metal lists. The masterpiece that is *Temple of Shadows*  can give me chills even though I've heard the songs innumerable times over the years.

For anyone more familiar (or more attentive than I am) with the essential list for the subreddit, has any band been added since the list was initially decided upon?"
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","Dragonland was added as a thanks for doing their AMA.  I think most people agreed they should have been up there in the first place and were ok with adding them. "
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","With all due respect to Dragonland, that's a pretty terrible reason to be included (and as a [permanent member](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/1rwhoy/concerning_the_essential_album_list/cdrr662) no less)."
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","Well normally I agree with you. But in the case of Dragonland they have arguably two albums that should be on the list. The only difference here was that they got to choose which album they wanted up there. "
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","Starfall and Astronomy!! (While they are my favourites, the popular opinion seems to be praising two other albums)"
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","So what I'm getting from this is that we need an Angra AMA. Let's make it happen guys!"
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","I support this. "
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","At this point, this issue has been discussed enough that I think we should simply have a vote on whether or not to add an Angra album, and which album it should be.

Any other issues with the list could be handled, or not, at another time.
"
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","Except that songs from THEY'RE NEW ALBUM haven't had much response. It's weird."
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","People are pretty miffed that neither South America nor Japan have any kind of representation on that list. If you really want albums to be added to that list, you gotta bring it up with our mod, /u/SpeakMouthWords. "
"Angra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?","If it were up to the voters, the list would be mostly Blind Guardian and Sabaton.  It was only through moderation that the list achieved some small semblance of being true to it's goal.  You can see the origin threads here:  
1. http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/1bb6ch/contest_mode_activated_vote_here_for_the/  
2. http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/1bkxq7/essentials_list_vote_results/  

At a certain point you have to give up and stop adding albums, or else ""essential albums"" just becomes ""albums we think are pretty good yeah?"""

As for the vocals, you're a really great singer, but this cover made it clear how difficult of a song this is to sing. You hit all the notes, and nothing sounded wrong, but it didn't quite sound the way Joacim does it. To be fair though, I love Joacim's voice to an unhealthy point of obsession."

"What songs brought you to power metal?","I know very well now that Power Metal is a genre that just... has a soul of its own, so to speak. It is almost like the bands are not sepperate, but form together the greatest community in music today.

So tell me what songs brought you into this great community, and if the song has any great meaning to you."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Ok, this is going to be really weird... but I got into Powermetal via playing a video game.

Side note - metal isn't 100% my thing. I am an industrial, neofolk, military pop, synthpop guy. Most folks who listen to neofolk like their metal black. And while I like the aesthetics of black metal, I am one of those who doesn't like the vocals. 

With that in mind...

Go back... oh 7 years? 8 years? My girlfriend and I are hardcore gamers. We been playing Sacred 2 on the xbox 360. And in the game, Blind Guardian makes an appearance. There's a quest you have to get their instruments, and then there is a cut scene and the band rocks out.


My girlfriend really liked their song, and ordered their album ""A Twist in the Myth"" which I imported into my mobile and really liked. I know folks call it power metal, but I thought of it as ""adventure metal"". So I started seeking out other adventure-metal bands and got an appreciation for them - leading to other bands like Kamelot, Dragon Force, etc."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Ok, I need some examples of military pop.  I'm intrigued. "
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Military pop sounds strangely awesome."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Military pop! It's high on the snare drum with programming and other instruments. I can recommend a lot of bands and songs for sure.

"What songs brought you to power metal?","Considering how much you bash Sabaton this is hilarious."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Why is it hilarious?"
"What songs brought you to power metal?","See below my friend! :)"
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Dragonforce - Through the Fire and Flames was first for me, but a song that really brought me to power metal was [Edguy - Land of the Miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BciNUFPR4kY)."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","DragonForce's Through the Fire and Flames introduced me to the genre. After that, I took that opportunity to come over to this subreddit and then I found Sonata Arctica's Gravenimage. It was amazing, but the song that really got me into the genre and made me listen to more of Sonata's stuff was The Cage. That, to me, was my gateway to powermetal. Afterwards, I went ahead to listen to all of their old stuff, new stuff, Edguy, Avantasia, and Helloween."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","rhapsody - emerald sword"
"What songs brought you to power metal?","The first power metal songs I ever heard were Dawn of Victory by Rhapsody and Wolf and Raven by Sonata Arctica.  I realized power metal was my favorite genre when I heard Kamelot's Epics and Lost Horizon's Awakening the World."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","For me it was early Hammer Fall. Before that I thought there was an equation more melodic=less heavy/fast.

Power metal opened my eyes, you can be very melodic *and* very fast."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","A burned CD of Manowar that had a bunch of their material up to 2002 (Warriors of the World)  while playing D&amp;D. (Thor and Hail and Kill)

First purchased was Hammerfall's Legacy of Kings. So songs like Heeding the Call and At the End of the Rainbow.

Iced Earth's Burning Times is another song I got addicted to after buying a Best Of led me down the road of Power Metal."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Two genres I like in the background when doing table top RPGing: power metal, and black ambient
"
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Answered this before but I think it was either - Sonata Arctica - Don't Say A Word, DragonForce - Heart of a Dragon or Rhapsody - Emerald Sword."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","I started listening to power metal in the late 90s/early 2000s during the p2p music stealing boom.  Symphony X - Evolution (the Grand Design) off Audiogalaxy was my go-to song.  Blind Guardian's Somewhere Far Beyond was the first PM album I ever purchased (which I sort of fell into because I actually went to get Seventh Son of Seventh Son but it was out of stock)."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Audiogalaxy was awesome back in the day.  I discovered so many bands through it.  I remember setting up like a 6 song queue when it went to bed so it would download over night. "
"What songs brought you to power metal?","[deleted]"
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Fucking Wisdom of the Kings was so fucking marvelous the first time I listened, I got so hooked on it that I had to have more! Hence my never dying love for Rhapsody... OF FIRE!"
"What songs brought you to power metal?","One hundred fucking percent agree. Silent Dream, Wisdom of the Kings, then Dawn of Victory in that order. First 3 songs of PM I heard."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Rain of a Thousand Flames is a fucking masterpiece start to finish."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","I believe the first Power Metal band I listened to was Masterplan (I didn't know it was called PM at the time, I just though it was some sweet-ass metal). Then later, Dragonforce's ""Through the Fire and the Flames"", as well as RoF's ""Emerald Sword"" triggered me to look for more of the same."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","It was early on in my first semester in college, back in September 2010, I was listening to a metal station on iTunes. The song Mindfeeder by Iron Savior came on, and I thought it was catchy, but never heard the song name, so I typed in some of the lyrics on Google and found it. From there I listened to all of Condition Red, then started looking up other big names in power metal, where I started getting really into Halloween, Gamma Ray, Rhapsody, Blind Guardian, etc. I'm not as into power metal now as I was 4 1/2 years ago, but if I hadn't heard that one song halfway through, my music tastes would definitely be different today."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","I think Karma by Kamelot"
"What songs brought you to power metal?","I think my early childhood exposure to classical music.   It was pretty much the only music in the house growing up.  Had a cool hippy neighbor, keep in mind I was about ten, but would play old Deep Purple, Yes, etc for me.  By the time I started buying my own records, I was a proghead, then metalhead  then just started expanding from there.  "
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Probably Everything Fades to Gray by Sonata Arctica. At the time I was about 12 or 13 and I only knew Sonata Arctica and Nightwish (specifically Oceanborn) for power metal, but I knew enough that they were my favorite bands. When I discovered that SA brought out a new album, Everything Fades to Gray really caught my attention and from there I just started exploring all their discography and since then branched out to similar bands and more recently trying out some new stuff. Still a lot to discover, but so far so good."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Childhood nostalgia made me like power metal.

Long time ago I was at a friend's house. We were playing on the computer, and he wanted to put on some music. He took out ""King of the Nordic Twilight"" by Luca Turilli on a cassette tape and put it on. I fell in love instantly, because the whole aesthetic reminded of the golden years of early 90's. The cover art was like from an old video game, and in fact the fast and cheery melodies reminded me of old NES games of my childhood like the Mega Man series. I actually thought then, that the album was made in the early 90's, because it was a tape. (I found out later that it was a pirated copy)

And today I still like power metal. The innocent fantasy adventure style still endears me, even though mostly I like my music more progressive and with a deeper subject matter."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Funny story, Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows growing up (still a guilty pleasure of mine) and the soundtrack to it is pretty Power Metal-ish. I remember listening to Manowar, loving the power and cheese of the music and it reminded me of Power Rangers. I liked Metal long before that but Power Metal is only a recent discovery of mine and it's quickly becoming one of my favorite metal genres."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","It was a long time ago, it was a Helloween song, can't remember which one I heard first, probably Future World. "
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Hmm... the first song was Blind Guardian - Curse Of Feanor, but then what really hooked me were Glory to the Brave and Legacy of Kings by HammerFall (albums)"
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Ive been getting into blind guardian lately, but the android store doesnt have a damn quarter of their music, and pirating sites dont either."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","If you're not worried about space, there are FLAC versions of all their songs from a quick Google search."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Sonata Arctica - San Sebastian introduced me to the genre when I heard it in (of all places) an AMV on youtube back when youtube first came out (like 2005). I actually can't stand AMVs though, but I don't think I'd ever seen one before that one.

Believe it or not, I heard Through the Fire and the Flames in 2006 BEFORE it was on Guitar Hero. HIPSTER PRIDE, jks"
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Same here,  San Sebastian had me the moment I heard it... Probably on YouTube as well. "
"What songs brought you to power metal?","The first Power Metal song I ever heard was Hammerfall's Heeding the Call. I found it... Wait for it... Through a Kingdom Hearts fanfic.

Yes, really.

It was the only Power Metal song I actually listened to for like a year before my brain rubbed two neurons together and thought, ""Hey, this is awesome, why don't we check what the rest of this band's music is like?"" That eventually led me to discovering the genre as a whole."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Hammerfall-Threshold"
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Altaria - Unchain The Rain.

I had heard a few occasional power metal tracks from the likes of Helloween and Edguy here and there, but never really pursued the genre, mostly because I didn't know it _was_ a genre. I somehow happened upon Altaria's Unchain The Rain and was hooked ever since.

I also can't stand anything else by Altaria and only listen to Unchain the Rain occasionally for nostalgia now. Not at all a fan of theirs despite getting me into the genre."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","It was actually Hammerfall's Blood Bound which got me into power metal. I'd been watching a free DVD that came with a metal magazine with my stepdad and having a chuckle at some of the rubbish on there, when the video for Blood Bound came on. We both stopped and went 'Well, that was surprisingly good'. From there, i looked more and more into Hammerfall and gradually further and further into the power metal genre as a whole. "
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Rhapsody of Fire- Dawn of Victory.

Kind of cringey how I came across it though. I was in middle school and was looking up Legend of Zelda videos, and I found a tribute video that had it playing. Needless to say, I was hooked!"
"What songs brought you to power metal?","The first ever power metal song that I listened to was The Eternal Flames of Metal, by Cryonic Temple, and I was blown away by its epicness.

I didn't listen to any power metal for a while after that, until I discovered Galneryus, and was amazed by songs such as Future Never Dies and Angel of Salvation. At that time I hadn't heard a single song with Yama-B.

After that it was Dragonforce, and then I found all the other great bands."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Sonata Arctica ""The Cage"". Still get goosebumps every time I hear that song."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","So, the first power metal song I'd ever heard was [Falconer - Vid Rosornas Grav](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po3XdK1DuJY)

The story behind this is as follows:   
So, since I was like 8, I was really into Rammstein (they were the second metal (actually, I guess they're not metal) band that I'd really listened to a bunch, after Black Sabbath). Now, for some reason, I was intrigued to find some Swedish language metal (probably because I liked the novelty of Rammstein's German and was looking for more like that. (it's a wonder I didn't find [Raubtier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogLwHEPyXBE) first)

Anyway, so after searching for ""swedish language metal"" one of the first videos I found was the Falconer song. It was alright, so I checked out the band. Once I heard [Mindtraveller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yMsxQWuWvE), I knew I had found something pretty sweet. From there I found HammerFall, Alestorm and more recently bands like Kiuas and Wisdom."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Although I had heard various other power metal songs prior to this, it wasn't until I listened to Symphony X's [King of Terrors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRc8iUc1vG8) that I really got into power metal. I liked it enough to check out a Symphony X station on Pandora Radio and it just happened to play [Angels Cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27kjPL5vdS0) by Angra. I was hooked.

Today King of Terrors doesn't hold a lot of significance for me, just a song I enjoy. Angels Cry on the other hand always gets me really happy and pumped up. I'll get in the mood for it and just can't shut up about it. My friends can attest to that fact."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","I've listened to a lot of classic rock, hard rock, and metal.  Around 2006 or 2007 (not sure exactly when, but it was prior to [this concert](http://www.last.fm/event/741564+DragonForce+at+Starland+Ballroom+on+26+November+2008)), I came across a reddit link which was a video of someone playing a Dragonforce song on Guitar Hero.  I made a Dragonforce station on Pandora and found a lot of music I liked.  Entering Eternity was the first Falconer song I heard.  A friend introduced me to Blind Guardian and Rebellion, and I introduced him to Falconer."
"What songs brought you to power metal?","This video which had Body Breakdown by Dragonforce

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxosvRTCOsk"
"What songs brought you to power metal?","Believe it or not, last.fm recommended [Van Canto's Kings of Metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiESgYr35gA) to me. I was really amused and thought it was awesomely hilarious. I proceeded to get their albums, unaware of power metal.

Their covers are good, and their music helped lighten the mood. However, a chain of events was starting to happen. One cover, [Wishmaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCGQiGEYl4Y) stuck out. 

In 2012, Nightwish released Imaginaerum. ""Wait. Didn't Van Canto cover those guys? I'll give it a shot"". I heard [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WfB8j4YuHw). Taikatalvi started out, and I was like ""this is neat"". 

The piano or synth starts out on Storytime, and I was like ""oooh"". Then I heard the guitars roar in. ""OOH."" Then the drums, but what got me was the orchestra. ""Holy shit!"" and then Anette started to sing. ""It's a woman, and she sounds awesome!"" My jaw was dropped. ""WHERE HAS THIS MUSIC BEEN ALL OF MY LIFE?!""

I immediately started to find the past Nightwish albums and discovered the Tarja era. I like both singers, by the way"
"What songs brought you to power metal?","A friend introduced me to power metal by showing me a few songs from time to time. The one that really got me hooked was [Falconer - The Clarion Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iswq0SWBRFA).  

It's still one of my favourite power metal songs if not my favourite."
"Falconer- Carnival of Disgust",""
"My power metal playlist","I have been listening to many playlists to discover new bands and started to very slowly build up my own in the past few months. It's meant mostly as both a personnel and discovery list, with most bands appearing only once wtih a few exceptions I'll eventually trim. Enjoy and feel free to make suggestions if you think it'd be in my chords.

"Power Metal Awards 2014 - Voting!!!","**Edit: Thanks for participating in the voting stage for the /r/powermetal 2014 awards. Voting is now concluded!!**

Thanks to /u/SpeakMouthWords for starting the process and putting together all the data!

What's being voted on is mostly just what was nominated, as in most cases the nominations were to spread out to have any fair cutbacks while still providing a good number of options. In one case I simply did a coin flip to decide whether Sonata Arctica's song would be 'Blood' or 'The Wolves Die Young,' as they each received one nomination and I thought it best for them to have one song present as with the other bands. Voting will be up for awhile so plenty of people can see it.

Edit: Nice job guys! Already over 100 responses!

Edit: A strong second day as well, with nearly 150 responses as of now. I will give a second reminder here as well that votes which strongly suggest multiple submissions will be ignored, so don't even waste your time.

not to get overly OCD on you"
"Power Metal Awards 2014 - Voting!!!","Thanks"
"Power Metal Awards 2014 - Voting!!!","Thanks for putting this together!"
"Power Metal Awards 2014 - Voting!!!","Some of these were difficult for me as most of my favourites didn't get to the voting stage (HammerFall, Edguy, Dragonforce, Twilight Force, Primal Fear etc.). Here were my votes:

Best album: Falconer - Black Moon Rising - Tough call between this, Sabaton, and Sonata Arctica, but I think this will have the most lasting power for me.

Best song: Sabaton - Night Witches - This song takes everything I love about Sabaton and throws a slight twist in it. Absolutely brilliant, and one of my favourite songs of the year.

Song with best solo: Dragonforce - No More - Dragonforce was my #1 album of the year last year, and their guitar work is one of the biggest reasons why.

Best unsigned release: Enceladus - Journey To Enlightenment - This album really blew me away. I hope people really take notice of them this year.

Best female fronted release: Mindmaze - Back From The Edge - Honestly, I didn't hear any of these albums, but I have Mindmaze's first album and it's pretty great, so I'd expect more of the same here.

Best Non-Guitar Instrumentation - Alestorm - Sunset on the Golden Age - Not too much to say here. I really like Alestorm

Best album cover - Twilight Force - Tales of Ancient Prophecies - Yes, it's excessively cheesy, but that's what power metal is all about!

Singer of the year - Ralf Scheepers - I feel like the only person who even listened to Delivering The Black. This album is a masterpiece! Scheepers is quickly reaching Kiske-levels of epicness for me. His performance on this album is out of this world, and he is even better live.

Album with the best lyrics: Falconer - Black Moon Rising - I really wanted to vote Twilight Force, but I just couldn't.

Lifetime Achievement: Joacim Cans - I expect Kiske to win (and deservingly so), but HammerFall is my favourite band and (r)Evolution is a step back in the right direction.

Mightiest warrior of 2014 - Chris Bay - Every single video I've ever watched of Freedom Call shows Chris Bay having the time of his life. In a genre already filled with cheese, Freedom Call is cheesier than any other band. Despite the flack they take for it (even from people who like the genre), Bay continues on creating more inspiring, positive music. Getting FC back on track in 2014 is great, but Bay's attitude makes him the mightiest warrior of 2014.

Upsword Award: Unlost Horizon - Can't say I know the users here too well, but every time I see Unlost Horizon post, it's usually something good."
"Power Metal Awards 2014 - Voting!!!","&gt; Singer of the year - Ralf Scheepers - I feel like the only person who even listened to Delivering The Black. This album is a masterpiece!

I placed it as my Best Album this year. I guess it didn't get enough nominations though."

"Power Metal Awards 2014 - Voting!!!","Well, to be fair, basically one person (anyone on this subreddit) could make a single nomination and they would end up on there. That's why you might think it odd that Albedo is up there for that specific nomination (which was my nomination, and I didn't expect it to actually end up on there, but hell yeah, it did)"

"Your favourite choruses from Power Metal","Yup.
I wonder if there's a proper name for what ""From the dephs of hell in silence"" is. Prelude and epilogue, perhaps?"

"Your favourite choruses from Power Metal","I meant the most memorable part of Night Witches isn't a chorus, but the intro and outros.

"Joacim Cans - Fields of Yesterday","I'm still kicking myself for finding this album for $9 and NOT picking it up."
"Joacim Cans - Fields of Yesterday","This album is a strange one for me. Joacim is easily one of my favourite singers ever, but somehow the songs on this album don't really fit his voice. It's too bad because the other HammerFall side project from around this time (Full Strike) sounds just like HammerFall.

In any case, I still enjoy this album a lot."
"Joacim Cans - Fields of Yesterday","Just a question, slightly related, what's your opinion of the [Warlord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1L8sTSI4iE) album with Joacim on vocals?"

"Sonata Arctica - San Sebastian","I can only hold so many feels man"
"Sonata Arctica - San Sebastian","That's why I like Sonata Arctica, their music celebrates and places in uplifting tones the trials and tribulations of the human soul.

Edit: not *all* of it is in uplifting tones"
"Sonata Arctica - San Sebastian","Sonata Artica was one of my favourite bands. I introduced my ex to them and they quickly became her favourite band too. When we broke up I no longer heard the uplifting tones and could only really hear the lyrics. 

The music made me feel like shit... the memories etc they would conjure, as well as the lyrical themes in general. I couldn't listen to them (and a few other bands as well) at all. 

One day I just decided that I had listened to them for years before we had met, and that I wasn't going to let something that was out of my control affect the things that I enjoy. I listen to them all the time!"
"Sonata Arctica - San Sebastian","Same here!  It and Wolf and Raven are the most awesome songs they've written!  Silence was an awesome album."

"Dark Moor- Swan Lake",""
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","Yeah I know I'm 3+ months late on asking that. 

Still, it's pretty early in the year and, apart from a glaring exception (Blind Guardian), there's not much 2015 power metal going on right now. I myself have only listened to one album so far - Orden Ogan - and it was kind of eh. Makes me feel like I'm slowly drifting away from this genre sometimes. 

Anyway, given what we know, is there anything for you to look forward to in 2015? [Here's](http://www.metalstorm.net/events/new_releases.php?upcoming=1) a list of upcoming metal stuff, though it's not complete by any means.

I personally plan to give [Magic Kingdom - Savage Requiem](http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Magic_Kingdom/Savage_Requiem/485658) a listen once it's out even if I'm not particularly excited about Magic Kingdom (as there's nothing else at the moment).

[Lancer](http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Lancer/Second_Storm/486365) are also coming out with a second album so that would also be another thing I plan to listen to at some point.

Other stuff? Well Helloween are getting an album out but I can already predict it's gonna have a couple of catchy Helloween-style songs and a bunch of filler in between. I'm not craving for more Helloween anyway.

Heavenly has sadly gone AWOL again, which makes me fear the album is stuck in limbo.

Insania and Instanzia have promised albums this year and I genuinely look forward to both, but I don't see any update and they haven't even provided a tentative release date, so my bet is that both albums are far from over and it will be a long time until we get to listen to them. (maybe not even in 2015)

Honestly the only thing that really got me excited this year was Timeless Miracle's facebook post about planning to start writing stuff for the new album.

Edit: Somehow completely forgot about Cain's Offering. Okay this year doesn't sound too bad now, but I will still retain my excitement until I listen to samples."
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","Some of what I'm looking forward to:

- Kamelot

- Nightwish

- Borealis

- Luca Turilli's Rhapsody

- Symphony X

- Theocracy

- Keldian is also going to start work on their new album, but probably not for 2015"
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","Kinda off topic but hows Nightwish live? I only know a handful of songs by them and am considering seeing the Sabaton/Nightwish show that's coming to my area in May. "
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","You can watch their Wacken concert on Youtube to get a feeling for them."
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","I very much enjoyed Nightwish live.  Floor is fantastic and Marco's voice is just piercing!  Sabaton is worth the price of admission, too."
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","Instanzia and Borealis are both planning to finally release their new albums this year. I'm really hyped for those when they finally get released. Also, the tribute to Sonata Arctica, I supported the kickstarter for it and the album will be coming in the mail sometime.

EDIT: Oh yeah, also symphony X

EDIT 2: Maybe cellador? They said they're working on something."
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","Why must Heavenly continue to make me sad? It's been over 4 years. "
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","Cain's Offering.

And seeing Falconer as much as I possibly can before they stop performing live."
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","Symphony X would be my most anticipated album of the year. Paradise Lost and Iconoclast were so fantastic."
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","[deleted]"
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","Kamelot 

Martin Beck's Induction

Helloween

Luca Turilli's Rhapsody

Scar Symmetry

Time II - Wintersun (Only 1% Chance of Happening)

Seventh Wonder 

Symphony X

Theocracy

Dream Theater

Pagan's Mind

Some of these are maybe's..."
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","The only major ones I'm waiting for are Borealis and Helloween. Both should be near the top of my year-end list. 

As for the rest, I'm sure there are a lot of good power metal releases coming this year, but I'm pretty backed up with all of the stuff releasing around right now, so I'm not looking too far ahead."
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","I would love for a new Aorlhac, Aquilus, Lifeform, Xe-NONE, Blacklodge and Ea album but that's probably not going to happen

For things that are going to be released, I'm  hyped for the new Galar, Kauan, Oxxo Xoox, Odious, Ages and probably 20 new Senmuths. Nothing Power Metal has really got my attention this year. 

Edit: Definitely hoping for a new Progenie Terrestre Pura as well"
"What are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?","Even though Nightwish is one of my favorite bands, my first experience with powermetal (and not symphonic metal like Nightwish) is Rhapsody (before the name change). Luca Turili's album was very good and so much better than the Dark Wings of Steel one so I'm super hyped for the new Prometheus album. "
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Power Metal isn't the most well-known genre as it is, but what are the bands which you don't see every other day on this sub?

Edit: you people are awesome."
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Power Quest is always good for a more ""classic"" sound. Unfortunately, they broke up a while back, but they still have a pretty good catalogue. "
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Wuthering Heights. Not talked about too much, although it doesn't help that they're currently on hold. Five fantastic albums with some of the best lyrics in the genre. Give ""The Shadow Cabinet"" a listen and enjoy!"
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Celesty is really good but I don't ever hear anyone talk about them"
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Probably cause they disbanded in 2012"
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Elvenstorm. Female fronted power metal from France that emulates thew classic German sound rather than the operatic style of the more popular female fronted bands."
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","[Kiuas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hQRpu_cYEg)

I've seen them get a few posts here and there, but they don't really get much recognition, especially not what they deserve"
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","[deleted]"
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","My favorite ""underground-ish"" PM bands are Borealis, Viathyn, Cellador, Antiquus, Forgotten Tales, Instanzia, Primalfrost, Sequester, and Zonata."

"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","So here's my list.


If you're into something more proggy but still power check out [Anthriel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe4MMV7oQwE)


[Ostura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaOdzCnmHiM) with plenty of vocalist is definitly something underrated and worth checking.


Same goes for [Ascension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_tCoI4iRHk). If you're familiar with Sharky Sharky it's basically the same band but more serious.


[Bane of Winterstorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDUht4jjEKw). One of the greatest band you'll ever hear in your life. I think.


[Dynazty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty6WNPv5pu8). My best discovery of 2014 and definitely something unique and underrated.


If you're into Running Wild, here's clone of this band which is (in my opinion) even better than them. [Blazon Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Llr_h4KITJc)


If you don't mind harsh vocals, here's my best album from 2014. [Crimson Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snI-FiyM7Dg)


Well, I'm not a big fan of [Crosswind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b-7nqfE6qs) but this song is just sweet.


I think you know this one, but anyway. [Dreamtale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlU1jaFcaQ)


[Exlibris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd30lArQdaQ) just check out this violin solo here. INSANE!


If you're tired of every female metal fronted band, which sounds exactly the same, [Forgotten Tales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dd4-0gCYXY) is here to dry your tears. I love how she's not trying to sing more symphonic or so. Best power metal fronted band. You can actually fell the power here. 10/10


If you don't mind band being cheese, Power metal super hero band! How awesome is this? [Grailknights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cpEd7Z345E)


I don't know if [Iron Mask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfayPYR2EM4) is underrated, but they definitely need more attention.


You ever heard of [Pathfinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbjCU-7hDJw)? I'm sure you did.


You like Freedom Call? You'll like [Ravenheart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIGRof8l1HE) even more.


I've been waiting for this album more than one year, and when it came out, totally not disappointed. You can here something from Blind Guardian here, but don't let it fool you. This band is totally unreal. And this band is called [Stilverlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOy1X15X1ac)


If you're into Power Metal bands singing about love and stuff like this, [The Magnificent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh9pF6H9vN8) is great. (Sorry for linking full album, but i couldn't find anything on youtube with OK quality)


If you're in love with violin and again, don't mind some harsh vocals, [The Privateer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXVO4BCYXhg) is here to bring you some sweet melodies.


if you don't mind religious bands, [Theocracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3KxF492fxQ).


Power Neo-classical metal here. [Time Requiem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjGhOYZxIRI)


[Wisdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFjVEXhWMgQ) is one of the most underrated power metal bands ever. Just listen to those high notes and excellent guitar/drums work. Masterpiece.


And here's my recent discovery. [Merging Flare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsw3aJohnDE) released only one album, but it's the best one album band around here.


And that's my list, I hope you enjoyed it."
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Thank you, sir!"
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Skylark, Beautiful Sin, Helstar, Dreamtale, and Angel Dust. "
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Beautiful Sin was phenomenal, I really, really wish they'd throw together another album. One of the few female-fronted bands I *really* like.

That said - adding **Vandroya** to the discussion. In my opinion, they were the album of the year in 2013 and I still haven't spoken to many people that have heard of them."
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Highland glory, Norwegian power metal band."
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Altaria, Aquaria, Dragon Guardian, Skywings. There are a lot of bands out there I never see on this sub. "
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Labyrinth(Italian melodic[English vocals]) and Orphaned Land(Israeli folk/death/progressive[Primary English vocals,  some Hebrew]) are two of my favorite bands that rarely appear on here. Orphaned maybe less so because they're not dedicated power metal,  but genres blend very easily in modern music
"
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone that listens to metal that hasn't heard of Orphaned Land. They've been around for 20 years and have quite a following. They're just not posted here because they're not power metal."
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","I would say that they have power metal songs,  and that they also have songs that fit into other genres.   They're very versatile,  particularly since returning with Mabool "
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","They've got that one power metal-y song... All is One or something"
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Hypersonic is an Italian female-fronted band that as far as I know only has one album but it's amazing. It has a good variety of music and it's not symphonic, just lighter power metal."
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","I was positively surprised by Orden Ogan when they opened for Hammerfall last time I saw them. I'd like to see more of those guys, folk / power metal."
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Sequester, Lifeform, Awe.some, Camlann, Cyberya, Illegal Operation, Epiclore, Waterland, Finist, Hannibal, The Lightbringer, My Material Season, Catharsis, Oceans of Night, Neutrino, Pegasus, Pesante, Kokumaromilk, Satanic a la mode, Scientic, Saluth o/o/o/, Spira, Tuatha du Danann and Cydonia are just a few off the top of my head "

"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Boys of Battle is quite the obscure one. They are a young band, and are on the definetly cheesy side of PM. I think i found them when they posted about their band here last year or maybe 2013... Can't remember when it was.

But since i love me some cheesy PM (i mean, take something like the Unicorn invasion of Dundee, a song about friggin UNDEAD UNICORNS. How can you not love it!) along with the normals, them setting your typical power metal and fantasy cliches in a school setting (seemingly the first few grades, since there's show-and-tell mentioned, and one of the songs starts with little kids bickering about ice cream)"
"What are some lesser-known power metal bands?","Some very nice suggestions here...always happy to get pointed to lesser know bands. Thumbs Up!"
"What are some of Jorns best albums?","I have always known the voice Jorn Lande from Avantasia / Revolution Renaissance / Masterplan, however I never knew who he was and thought it was separate singers. 

Finally put a face to a voice, haha. 

So I want to pick out some albums of his, what are some of the best solo albums + other projects he worked on that I should check out? "
"What are some of Jorns best albums?","Hi, I am Jorn's #1 fan. At least on here. :D

Like Edledhron said, all the Masterplan albums featuring Jorn are great. These are the self-titled debut album, as well as *Aeronautics* and *Time to be King*. Aeronautics is my personal favorite.

While it's not power metal, his solo records are awesome. *The Gathering* is a must have album, as it has remastered versions of his oldest two albums and some great covers as well. Tracks you *NEED* to listen to are ""Gonna Find the Sun"", ""Young Forever"", ""Hourglass"", ""Gate of Tears"", ""Worldchanger"", and ""Starfire"". That should get you started. After that, you can dive into the rest of his albums. 

I personally didn't get his first two albums. The first one has a lower production quality, and all the good songs have seen remastered editions later. All the noteworthy songs on *Worldchanger* are also present on *The Gathering*. *Out to Every Nation* would be the earliest album I'd recommend. Check out the title track and ""Living with Wolves"".

As for the rest of the albums:

* *The Duke*: Here you should check out ""Stormcrow"" and ""Starfire"" (which is remastered).  
* *Unlocking the Past*: A cover album. Cool tracks here are ""Burn"" and ""Kill the King"".  
* *Lonely are the Brave*. The title track is great, and check out the bonus track ""Stormbringer"" if you can find it.  
* *Spirit Black*: Title track is crazy awesome, ""Burn Your Flame"" is also crazy awesome, and ""I Walk Alone"" is a surprisingly crazy awesome cover of Tarja Tururnen's forgettable solo track.  
* *Dio*: A tribute to his friend Ronnie James Dio, may he rest in peace. ""Kill the King"" you've heard earlier. My personal favorite on this one is ""Stand Up and Shout"". ""Sunset Superman"" is another great track.  
* *Bring Heavy Rock to the Land*: Possibly his best album since *The Gathering*. The title track is one magnificent track, and ""A Thousand Cuts"" is equally awesome. ""The World I See"" is immensely powerful, great one. There's also a version of ""Time to be King"" from the Masterplan album, but IMO the Masterplan version is better.  
* *Traveller*: His latest album. I didn't really like this one that much. The title track is pretty awesome, though.

And THAT should keep you busy. Jorn is love, Jorn is life."
"What are some of Jorns best albums?","Amazing response bro, thank you so much. Going to check out your list! "
"What are some of Jorns best albums?","If you're a fan of Jorn, I highly recommend listening to the first three Allen/Lande albums. Tons of good Jorn vocals on them and Magnus Karlsson is a consistently brilliant song writer. Will definitely turn you on to the vocal god that is Russell Allen."
"What are some of Jorns best albums?","My favorites:

Masterplan - All (Jorn) albums

Solo - Lonley Are the Brave

Ayreon - 01011001 

Avantasia - The Scarecrow

Arc - Burn the Sun"
"What are some of Jorns best albums?","Awesome will check it out. 

I have all of those albums besides the solo one and Arc. 

What is Arc like? "
"What are some of Jorns best albums?","A much more progressive Masterplan/Jorn Solo might be a good way to describe them."
"What are some of Jorns best albums?","When it comes to his solo stuff, there really isn't a weak album in the bunch. All can be recommended."
"What are some of Jorns best albums?","Everyone else named the albums I would have, from Avantasia (check out Angel of Babylon as well) to Masterplan

The ones I can name on top of those:

* [Nikolo Kotzev's Nostradamus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVsgx2qGiI). He's not on all of the songs, but he's on the best ones and he sounds awesome. Jorn vs Joe Lynn Turner
* Allen Lande (All of them). The early ones were somewhat tame, but some really nice songs. [Master of Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4HyVoTwJO0) is well-known in this sub. The latest album is awesome. "
"What are some of Jorns best albums?","Get everything you can get your hands on, but his MK3 Deep Purple covers are earth shattering."
"What are some of Jorns best albums?","Aside from the power stuff he did. He was in a band called Beyond Twilight that did some sweet progressive metal. Their first album ""The Devil's Hall of Fame"" is really really good."

"Blind Guardian- Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)","My apologies."
"Blind Guardian- Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)","Yeah! I mean this is a Power Metal Sub-Reddit! How dare you post Power Metal in it! Sure you've got like 19 upvotes showing that people approve of your post and all but...C'mon!"
"Blind Guardian- Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)","People are voting on it based on the name, not because it makes a notable contribution to the sub. Some Blind Guardian is fine and good, but the past few days have seen a bit too much."
"Blind Guardian- Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)","Again, my apologies. Weren't you the last one to post this particular song, Edledhron of the Noldor?"
"Blind Guardian- Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)","Yeah, though there was less of a BG flood then, plus it was a special occasion with Tolkien's birthday.

But like I said, I don't take an issue with BG being posted, they've just had a lot of coverage on the sub lately, so it's best to get some other names in there too. If any particular band was receiving a bit too much attention, we'd be saying the same thing. "
"Blind Guardian- Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)","I didn't mean to sound accusatory. I simply thought it was funny that both times this song has been posted, it has been by someone with something elven in their username and/or flair."
"Blind Guardian- Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)","19 upvotes!? stop the presses boys!

The point is, we don't need 8 Blind Guardian submissions a day. "
"Blind Guardian- Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)","Now that's something new and refreshing"
"Blind Guardian- Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)","This song has probably my favourite chorus by them."

"Black Sabbath - God Is Dead? - Does Sabbath count as power metal?","My second favorite power metal band. Right after Candlemass. "
"Black Sabbath - God Is Dead? - Does Sabbath count as power metal?","You could at least post something from Ronnie James Dio era"
"Black Sabbath - God Is Dead? - Does Sabbath count as power metal?","Depends on the era. Ozzy stuff is more Doom or Traditional Heavy Metal, whereas the Dio stuff is more closer to Power Metal, but still entrenched in Tradtional Heavy Metal."
"Black Sabbath - God Is Dead? - Does Sabbath count as power metal?","Not at all - I think you knew the answer.  Please try to avoid posting non-power metal unless you have a good reason to do so (e.g. relevant to something at the time)."
"Black Sabbath - God Is Dead? - Does Sabbath count as power metal?","No. I don't reckon. Love Sabbath though"

Just a random question: You're listed as *Heavy Metal* on Metal Archives, but do you consider yourselves more power metal? Many songs on the new album are definitely power metal-y."
"Lords of the Trident - FROSTBURN - New album released today! Listen online at this link.","Picking genres is such a nebulous process...while my tastes go more towards power metal (I really like the symphonic-backed stuff, especially), a lot of people consider us classic metal, ""traditional metal"", heavy metal...the list goes on and on. I figure heavy metal is the broadest definition, so we chose to say that."
"Lords of the Trident - FROSTBURN - New album released today! Listen online at this link.","Yeah, that's probably the most sensible thing to do! I'll still consider you guys to be power metal, though :p Out of curiosity, what are your favorite symphonic metal bands?"

"Discovering Power Metal: Dragonland","###Discovering Power Metal: Dragonland  
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to listen to some **DRAGONLAND**.

Once again I dare venture upon sacred land, the Land of Dragons of the Sidebar continent. I, a heathen and a pagan adventurer, shall embark on a treacherous journey through this land, bringing back any *treasure* I can find.

[Review index](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2qlzcx/review_index_discovering_power_metal/)    
*****  
###About the band  
**Genre**: Power Metal (often called symphonic power, but come on)  
**Country**: Sweden

Dragonland is a power metal band that is perhaps best distinguished by their great vocalist Jonas Heidgert, and by their sound that, while staying relatively close to the basic power metal recipe, simultaneously manages to sound entirely different from other bands. It's difficult to put the finger on exactly what it is that defines Dragonland as a band. If I had to narrow it down to one thing, I'd have to say that their *songwriting* is what sets them apart.

Sporting five albums, Dragonland has an established name in the power metal scene. After some years of hiatus, they appear to be back to doing (a few) live shows, and there were apparently re-releases of their two oldest albums put out this month. Can't find much info on that, though. I'd be more interested in a *new* album.

Three of their albums are based on *The Dragonland Chronicles*, a work of fiction created by the band itself. Essentially, these three are all related *concept albums*. I haven't delved into the actual story, and I'd go ahead and assume that it's nothing too deep. The first two albums and the fifth album are the ones that tell the tales of Dragonland. The third album doesn't seem to have a lyrical theme, and the fourth album is about *space*. All in all, I think we're in for a very varied and interesting experience!  
******  
###The Battle of the Ivory Plains (2001)  
2001 marks the debut of Dragonland, with the first concept album to deal with the Dragonland Chronicles. The album starts off with the mandatory instrumental intro, which could easily have been a movie or video game soundtrack. Then the album really kicks off with [Storming Across Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3pNHqCqdkY). The first 25 seconds are brilliant, with kickass guitars and a good ol' high-pitched power metal scream. This segment gave me high hopes for this album, but the rest of the song didn't quite live up to its bombastic intro. The vocals are kinda monotone, making the song a dull overall. *A Last Farewell* is a ballad and a duet featuring a female guest vocalist. It's nothing special, and honestly quite boring imo. [Ride for Glory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPqTjxNuNX4) has some really cool instrumental segments, and is arguably the best song on the album. The chorus is actually pretty good, here. The title track has an interesting intro, but as with *Storming Across Heaven*, the vocals are pretty lackluster. *Rondo Alla Turca* is a short rendition of a piece of classical music. While it is generally well done, I think it would have sounded better if it was slowed down just a bit. [A Secret Unveiled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4DCKkYZuYc) is another okay song with pretty nice guitar segments.

To sum this album up, it's just not really that good. *Ride for Glory* is my favorite from this album, but even so, this isn't an album that I will personally go back and listen to. The sound quality is decent for a debut album, so check out the linked songs and determine if it is worth your time.  
*****  
###Holy War (2002)  
Already one year later, the *Dragonland Chronicles* saga continues. Also this album starts with an instrumental intro. It's pretty neat, could easily be a LotR soundtrack or something. The first normal track is *Majesty of the Mithril Mountains*, which is somewhat a weak kickoff. Except for the solo segments, the guitars and drums are pretty repetitive. Moreover, there is barely any semblance of vocal variation. [Through Elven Woods and Dwarven Mines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgY4reWfU_w) kicks it up a notch with pretty cool keyboard and guitar throughout the song, though still with uninspired vocals. The [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXgK3bKP2s0) is probably the song with the best vocals on this album, and it's pretty good instrumentally, too, with a nearly 2 minute long solo segment. Then we *Return to the Ivory Plains*, but there's nothing to see (or hear). [A Thousand Points of Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLpfJuie-7k) is a decent finisher for the album, not counting the 4 and a half minute outro.

The conclusion for this album is the same as the first one: Meh. There are a few tracks worth checking out for those who REALLY love their later albums, but it's nowhere as good. The title track and *A Thousand Points of Light* are the most notable tracks, but the rest is skippable.  
*****  
###Starfall (2004)  
With this album, Dragonland begun getting really good at what they're doing. It departs from the fantasy theme and instead takes on a variety of lyrical themes. It's a consistently good album with 8 standalone tracks and a three-part thingamajig called *The Book of Shadows* at the end. Despite this consistency, I couldn't find any single track that I feel deserve a special mention (and hence a playlist addition). This album is definitely a step up from the earlier two albums on the instrumental side, adding a lot more focus on (electronic) keyboard sounds. However, I feel that the vocal part did not improve to the same extent. I know this is the favorite album for some of you, and while I'd probably pick one of the next two albums, I can definitely appreciate Starfall for its consistent quality level. First, I want to get *The Book of Shadows* out of the way. Let's not beat around the bush - it's a weak finish of this album. Part 1 is a random instrumental part, part 2 has slow vocals that aren't as good as the rest of the album, and part 3 is another instrumental that admittedly is quite mysterious and interesting. As for the actually notable tracks, I'd say the rest are all notable. Perhaps with the exception of *The Returning*. [As Madness Took Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oncmbjuu7yY) is a decent album starter with a nifty electronic intro and a catchy chorus. The [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI9IJpR-jzA) has a catchy intro, decent vocals, a cool guitar hook at the end of the first chorus, and a cool solo segment. [Calling my Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYGJL7zXA) has some of the best vocals on this album, though the chorus is somewhat underwhelming. [In Perfect Harmony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkNIBKZmpWc) has a pretty sweet intro and kind of an aloof vibe to it. That should be enough to get you familiarized with this album.  
*****  
###Astronomy (2006)  
As the album name reveals, we be talkin' bout space yo. The album starter is called **Supernova** ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeeTDGHiF3E)) and is the first Dragonland song I can *really* get behind. It encapsulates much of what I like about power metal. The intro (after 26 seconds, that is) is wonderfully cheerful and catchy. A major improvement on this album that is immediately evident is that the instruments and vocals are much, much more *congruent*. The instruments actually *carry* the voice up and make it more impactful. The vocals themselves are excellent, also a step up from earlier albums. It is also immediately clear that this album is a lot heavier than its predecessors, with pretty heavy bass and drums. Whether or not that is an improvement over *Starfall* is really a matter of opinion, mine being yes. *The Book of Shadows* returns with part 4, *yayness*. It's a random, stupid instrumental track. Also this album ends with a three-part thingamajig (stop it Dragonland), which is just as uninteresting as it was on *Starfall*. Other than that, this album is pretty good. The [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwf6VhhOAHg) is pretty damn good, with awesome vocals but lacking the intensity of *Supernova*, imo. [Contact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbbzPPOsUKY), [Antimatter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtDC9yyGfNQ) and [Beethoven's Nightmare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTShSv-95uI) are other noteworthy tracks.  
*****  
###Under the Grey Banner (2011)  
The final album of Dragonland makes a return to the *Dragonland Chronicles*. Whoop de doo. That aside, this is one of Dragonland's finest albums. In proper *Dragonland Chronciles* style, there is a mandatory instrumental intro that you can skip, yay. Even the second track, [Shadow of the Mithril Mountains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QseCih9H40) takes a minute to start up. After that it's a decent album kick-off. The quality level quickly rises with [The Tempest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6anQjgYeOnQ), which is a slow track with very intense vocals, giving the song a epic and motivating vibe. The guitar solo segment is nothing short of epicly intense. I love these slow guitar solos brimming with emotion, too bad it's a little short. Great track. Then we come to **A Thousand Towers White** ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp-cmldfErY)), which is easily Dragonland's best track. What can I say? It's fast and bombastic, with quick drums and nifty bass guitars accentuating the song. The vocals are ex-ce-llent! [Fire and Brimstone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jOn2CRDVw0) is all right, but I find the narrator voice kinda distracting from the overall quality of the song. The [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtGW8kDomxs) is decent, but it is 8 minutes long and I find myself bored towards the end. The album ends with an inconsequential outro, unless you've got the Japanese bonus track edition. This bonus track is called [At the Inn of Éamon Bayle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zZva8IiTSw) and is actually pretty good. The other albums had some bonus tracks as well, but none were worth noting. Anyway, this song sounds a little folky, and is among the best tracks on the album along with *The Tempest* and *A Thousand Towers White*.  
*****  
###Conclusion  
Playlist additions:

* **Supernova** ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeeTDGHiF3E))
* **A Thousand Towers White** ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp-cmldfErY))

**TL;DR**: Dragonland is a unique band and is pretty good. Their best work is scattered across their latest three albums, whereas the first two albums are not really worth your time. *Starfall* introduces a focus on keyboard sounds, making the album very different from its two predecessors. The album is consistently good, with the exception of the three-part ending. *Astronomy* improves upon the *Starfall* sound, adding a focus on heavy guitars and drums. **Supernova** is a really great track from this album, with a cheerful intro and an intense, powerful sound throughout. *Under the Grey Banner* goes back to the Dragonland lore, for better or worse, and is a bit of an up-and-down album. **A Thousand Towers White** is my personal favorite track from this album and this band altogether.

It's difficult to pick a favorite album. All three of the latest albums suffer from useless intros, interludes, and/or outros, and/or multi-part snoozefests. The good stuff is scattered around these nuisances, but Dragonland has a lot to offer if you know where to look. I would pick *Astronomy* as my favorite album.

The next band I will be reviewing is **Divine Ascension**. *Pythia* and *Secret Sphere* are high up on the waiting list, *Elvenking* and *Sabaton* after that, and in between I might throw in some of the big names like Avantasia, Sonata Arctica, Rhapsody of Fire, and who knows, I might finally give Blind Guardian a try some time."
"Discovering Power Metal: Dragonland","I agree with most of what you said.  The first two albums are worth skipping over.  The last three albums are where its at.  However, saying The Book of Shadows and The Old House on the Hill are snoozefests kind of make me want to fight you.  

Also, The Trails of Mount Farnor literally owns your face and should probably be on the playlist   "

"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","The body of work is now sufficient to select a preference, or to say that each excels in some different way. Comparing singers is fun. Go!"
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","Both. I like classic Dragonforce as well as new Dragonforce. Both will always hold a special place in my heart."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","This. "
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","That's what up votes are for."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","Came here to say that. Have an upvote!"
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","This is a really great question, but the answer has to be ZP. The Valley of the Damned is my all-time favourite power metal album. It's a masterpiece, and he is a huge reason why. His performance never waned, even despite the one bad album in their catalogue (Ultra Beatdown).

With that said, it's hard to deny how great the work with Marc is. The first album with a new singer was opened with a wailing scream that immediately sold me on Marc. He's not as good of a singer, but both albums with him are near perfect. I think I like both better than Sonic Firestorm (my second favourite of the ZP era). "
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","Maybe I'm a blasphemer or whatever, but DragonForce got me into power metal in the first place(the genre I listen to almost exclusively now.) So yeah, thanks ZP.

That being said, if DragonForce wanted to go into a new direction, they couldn't have found a better match than Marc. I saw them live when they came to L.A. before Power Within was released, and I was sold.

At this point, classic DF and new DF fill different niches for me. I love the awesome nonsense lyrics and bombastic feel of classic DF, but I feel new DF meets a higher standard of quality(personal tastes aside.) 

Basically, ZP and Marc are both great at different things, and I'm too much of a fan/weenie to choose."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","This is really tough. And just so we don't have any debate later - Marc Hudson *does* have a ""wider"" vocal range than ZP Theart (A2-B5ish v. Bb2-G5ish). But I hate using ""wide vocal range"" as the reason why someone is a better singer. 

I'm siding with ZP on this one. Mostly because I like the tone of his voice significantly more.

I'm not a Dragonforce fan, so this is probably not as well-researched as some of yours, but I have seen both of them and, live, Marc is absolutely phenomenal. Like, they were mindblowingly good with Marc.

However, ZP has sung some of my favorite Dragonforce songs - some of the best (as in ""most complex"") vocal work Dragonforce has done has been stuff like *Above The Winter Moonlight*, *Black Winter Night*, *Starfire*, etc. He does some stuff with his voice that is just ridiculously impressive.

That said, I haven't really given Marc a chance on the recorded stuff. I haven't listened to anything after *Sonic Firestorm*, to be honest, and what I have heard I wasn't that impressed with. But I don't know if that's because the music hasn't evolved or whatnot.

But I can't overstate that - as a live performer - Marc is probably like top 10 vocalist I've ever seen."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","&gt;[...as a live performer - Marc is probably like top 10 vocalist I've ever seen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kZGNLIjSLI#t=277)

I agreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","This is so tough. I think I'm one of the few who looks forward to lineup changes within a band to see how one change can affect the whole project, even if it is for the worse in the end. When ZP was finished I couldn't wait to hear new Dragonforce material. Now that they've got two albums with him under their belt (and I have yet to see him live) it's still tough for me to say. 

Similar to what /u/70000TonsOfMetal said above me, I feel like Dragonforce has more noteworthy songs with ZP than with Marc (which obviously isn't the greatest analysis due to only having two albums with the guy.) On the other hand I have a much easier time listening to The Power Within and Maximum Overload from start to finish than I do Inhuman Rampage and Ultra Beatdown.

I guess you could say that, in my opinion, they've picked up the slack since their last two albums with ZP? Two albums is enough to say he was a suitable replacement (hell, one is probably enough) but I'm not entirely set on who I prefer just yet."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","After I heard Marc once, I knew I liked him more than ZP. I think that they're both good and fit well with Dragonforce, but I personally like Marc more."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","[deleted]"
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","I agree with parks completely for songs and vocal abilities. Only thing is ZP was much more genuine and passionate about crowd involvement. He owned the stage and the crowd was his.

Marc is good, but during solos he'll move behind Sam and Herman and Fred and won't involve himself with getting the crowd hyped, it almost feels awkward and uncomfortable.
"
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","I think I will always be partial to ZP myself. It's just that I've been a Dragonforce fan since the beginning, and to hear somebody other than ZP saying is quite different.

Nothing against Marc its just I prefer the ZP material over Marc material. It's not that the Marc stuff is bad it's just that the ZP stuff is just that much better.

So with that I would rather hear Valley of the Damned or Sonic Firestorm over The Power Within or Maximum Overdrive if given the choice."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","&gt;Maximum Overload"
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","Thank you for the fact check. I always mess that album name up."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","Marc by far. ZP couldn't perform old songs to save his life by the end of his run, and I got the feeling he stopped giving a shit after the Inhuman Rampage hype faded. Marc seems driven and focused, which is a lot more than I could say for ZP. 

*Twilight Dementia* is a good example of how bad ZP's vocals had gotten. On the other hand, Marc is pretty much flawless live, especially when he's singing his own material. And on the albums, ZP kind of just *let it all out there*, if you guys know what I mean. There was no subtlety and restraint on his part. He more or less resorted to talking his way through some songs on *Ultra Beatdown*. Marc's voice is a little generic, but I'd rather have generic than ""past his prime""."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","Ooh, arguing about DragonForce, my specialty. 

Hm...well, I would have to say that bringing a new voice, and by extension a new dynamic, forced them to evolve their sound somewhat and adapt to somebody with a wider range, was ultimately a good thing for the band. ZP was good, but his range was limited and I feel prevented them from exploring some possibilities that Marc is allowing them to look into now. Plus, ZP couldn't sing live, like, at all, whereas Marc is decent, at least. I'd have to go with Marc, because he simply did help the band grow."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","I'd say definitely Marc, although I don't dislike ZP's work with DragonForce. Maybe he's gotten better recently too, because he sounds great with [Pentakill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be1waE9myCU)"
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","I like both iterations of Dragonforce, with ZP and Marc Hudson. Right now, I'll go with ZP. However, Marc Hudson is growing on me, plus the band is figuring out how to perform with his voice. 

Given 1-2 more albums, I feel that I'll probably end up liking Marc Hudson more. Dragonforce has been shifting to a new sound, but keeping enough of the old sound around. While it sounds slower, the BPM actually sounds like it has gotten faster. "
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","ZP gets my vote. Valley of the Damned is the greatest album they have relased, and ZP's range is higher and just plain superior sounding than Hudson's I feel.

I do enjoy Hudson, don't get me wrong. And he has been getting better, his vocals on the Maximum Overload album was much better than The Power Within in my opinion."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","I gotta go with Marc. While I felt this year's album was lackluster, I thought The Power Within is one of the DF's strongest albums. Everything meshed well on that album, and Marc did a fantastic job."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","i liked how marc sounded on the first album better than zp.  his voice just sounded more...full and clear to me.  but their new album...damn, he blew me away.  three hammers especially, i play that song damn near every day on my way to the gym."
"Alright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?","In going to have to say ZP. I love Marc, but Dragonforces older stuff is what got me into power metal just because of the talent from ZP. Before Dragonforce, I didn't know this kind of music existed...now I'm hooked!!!"

What album should I buy next if I'm seeing them live? I think one of their really popular songs is from the second album? It seems hard to guess their setlist because it doesn't look like they play live very often."
"Falconer - Mindtraveller","The second one is *Chapters from a Vale Forlorn*. The song you're referring to might be [Clarion Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iswq0SWBRFA).


[*Northwind*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW2gsLyhk9g) and [*Among Beggars and Thieves*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1OdE5IslmU)(5&amp;6) are some of their more popular albums.


Third and fourth albums have a different vocalist, and just aren't as good/popular as the others.


The two newer ones - [*Armod*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jirq0rz_0xo) and [*Black Moon Rising*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv05oHDjus4) are great imo, although *Armod* is entirely in Swedish.

I will definitely check out Chapters From A Vale Forlorn next, followed by Northwind and Among Beggars and Thieves. I will likely skip Armod for now because I have difficult with non-English music, but this will keep me busy for a while!"

"Battle Beast - Madness (new song)","I do actually like this song. It may be not very original and a bit cheesy, but it has a decent riff and it's pretty catchy. It reminds me a bit of powerwolf. I think it would be great live material.

EDIT: I may also be a bit biased when it comes to Battle Beast. I really like the Berserk manga and it's fun to hear it referenced in their music."
"Battle Beast - Madness (new song)","Battle beast has always been bad, but this new album sounds comically awful.  I get so excited when there is a new band to loathe. "
"Battle Beast - Madness (new song)","Ugh, this is just too entirely bland and generic for me to enjoy it at all. Admittedly, I've never been a Battle Beast fan, but I was hoping the new album could change that. These last two songs they've released are making that seem very unlikely now.

"BABYMETAL have already gone full power metal before! Here's ""Akatsuki"", a massive tribute to '80s power metal","This is one of the most over-produced metal songs I've ever heard. It's like every last word was run through autotune half a dozen times. The vocals have this extremely soft, fuzzy texture around them that doesn't sound the least bit natural.

The other two girls get taken to the ""dark side of metal"" (which can be interpreted as nu metal) and the older girl must save them by fighting off the evil spirit within them (and performing a kickass power metal song). 

That's not even dancing. They're clearly having a pro wrestling match. Stone Cold has a run in about halfway through. If you look closely, you can see one hit the other with a barbed wire-wrapped steel chair."

"Bands that need to come back","So, I was inspired by return of Timeless Miracle abd this other band that also came back from the grave. And i decided to ask you. What band you want back? I'd love to hear new Dream Evil album. And you?"
"Bands that need to come back","Is Lost Horizon too obvious?

Other than them, there aren't really many bands I want to put out a new album. It would be cool if Metalium reunited because I think their move to heavy/power suited them much better than their early sound. I love the last two Metalium records, and wouldn't mind hearing another in that style. I should probably finish collecting the rest of their discography though."
"Bands that need to come back","Power Quest. It was only a couple of years ago that they broke up but they were the band that got me into Power Metal so they have a special place in my metal heart."
"Bands that need to come back","Yeah, same here! They had so much potential to make it even further with their new vocalist they had gotten just a few months before their split-up too!"
"Bands that need to come back","They broke up at the worst time, too. I honestly feel their last album was their best work, as though they'd finally perfected their sound."
"Bands that need to come back","That's exactly the one I was thinking of!

Dreadful shame, that. I wonder what Williams is doing now..."
"Bands that need to come back","So very true. One of the biggest losses to PM. Unfortunately I don't think this is likely to happen. Steve W has moved on to Eden's Curse and most of the others are deeply involved in their own bands too."
"Bands that need to come back","Lost Horizon is an obvious choice, if you have never listened to them, I fucking envy you, then go listen to them, and you will agree with me."

"Bands that need to come back","* Wuthering Heights

"Bands that need to come back","Nocturnal Rites. Seriously, they were on a good streak of albums before they stopped doing anything.

Would like to have After Forever and Nevermore back as well."
"Bands that need to come back","Didn't Nocturnal Rites last album sucked? I remember it being bad but it was a long time ago."
"Bands that need to come back","I'd say it was a 3.5-4 out of 5. Still good, but had the odd track that didn't work with it."

I'd love for Leverage to come back and put out a new album. If you like Finnish power metal, you're gonna love Leverage. ""[Wolf and the Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03ePbjRMjsk)"" is pretty much the song everyone gets into them with."

Dream Evil

Heavenly (where's your new album? pls respond)

Insania

Cellador

Instanzia

If we're counting bands that have called it quits, the list becomes heart-breakingly long. 

Also, although their latest albums have been out fairly recently, I  think it's time for Theocracy and Dragonland to make a return. 
"
"Bands that need to come back","Good list.  Add Fairyland as well.  "
"Bands that need to come back","&gt; Instanzia

I'm not sure they count here considering they've promised a new album for this year. They haven't gone anywhere."
"Bands that need to come back","My mistake, I was mainly thinking about bands that are still considered active (no news good news?) but haven't put out an album in quite some time. I'm aware Instanzia are coming up with a new album (as are Insania and Heavenly) but it always gets postponed to a later date and at this rate I'm getting troubled...

(as an example, a greek power metal band I know - Emerald Sun - were supposed to have their new album out by 2012-2013. It's 2015 and the album is yet to come out...)"
"Bands that need to come back","Cellador are actually having lots of shows. Just that they don't have a label for releasing a new album i think. They released a new EP like 2 years ago.

Instanzia are active, working on their new album.

Dream Evil, no one friggin knows. I hope they release another album."
"Bands that need to come back","From what I gather Cellador is working on putting stuff together and have been playing local shows, I'm sure someday we will see another album. "
"Bands that need to come back","Nocturnal Rites broke up?! nooooooo :("
"Bands that need to come back","IIRC there is a new album from Heavenly forthcoming. "
"Bands that need to come back","And I want Simon Kostro back"
"Bands that need to come back","Bal-Sagoth please.  "
"Bands that need to come back","Agreed"
"Bands that need to come back","Sadly, I doubt they will ever put out another album, with the hexalogy complete, there's no more lyrical content for Byron to work with and somehow, I never heard a single thing about the Maudling brothers in recent times."
"Bands that need to come back","They have a new band called Kull. I think the album is due in 2015.

"Bands that need to come back","That's great news for sure. It sounds like it has potential. Thanks a ton!"
"Bands that need to come back","[deleted]"
"Bands that need to come back","For Power Metal, Lifeform/Barsoom, Epiclore, Furthest Shore, Camlann,  Tuatha de Danann, Ashtar and Excalion are all bands I'd love to see get back together (if they're split up) and make something new. 

For non-Power Metal, definitely Pulse or Damned Spirits' Dance."
"Bands that need to come back","First off, Heavenly. Technically still active, but their new album has been indefinitely delayed, from what I've heard. Powerquest is another one I'd like back. Aquaria would be a good one. Fairyland is kind of in the same boat as Heavenly, technically still around but might as well not be. Also, I want the *old* Spellblast back. They're still around and performing, but it's Spellblast in name only. They've 100% changed their style. Not that the new stuff is bad, it's just not what it was. "

"Bands that need to come back","I've been hoping for a new Demons and Wizards album for years prior to the last 2 Iced Earth records. Schaffer seems so uninspired and I feel that not even Hansi could overcome Jon's tired songwriting. I'd still mark out over it if it ever happened and would love a chance to see them live. "
"Bands that need to come back","Versailles, fuck that vocalist from Jupiter, he is making japanese power metal seems bad"
"Bands that need to come back","What's wrong with Zin?

Besides, [Kamijo's dong his own thing right now and it's pretty awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg_DOt-xyig)."
"Bands that need to come back","i really dont like him, IMO he doest fit well in a PM band"
"Bands that need to come back","but then again, that's what japanese power metal is and it has j-rock written all over it a lot of the time 

also tbh, I like Kamijo and Jupiter better than Versailles.."
"Bands that need to come back","&gt; I like Kamijo and Jupiter better than Versailles

Agreed. But *Noble* is still the best thing any of those groups ever did."
"Bands that need to come back","Versailles. I like Zin and all but Kamijo's voice really fucking made their whole audio aesthetic. Further, the band seems less baroque-influenced now."
"Bands that need to come back","Galloglass would be the first band to come to mind. Legends From Now And Nevermore is so unreal. I want them to reform, even though it's been ten years.. "
"Bands that need to come back","Came to post this one. "

"Bands that need to come back","Nevermore,Lost horizon,Crimson Glory(with Midnight rip),Conception(Has khan,not power metal but still),Highland Glory(They are like Lost Horizon's little brother)"
"Bands that need to come back","&gt; Nevermore, (We have Sanctuary again, so it's kinda close)
Lost horizon, 
Crimson Glory(with Midnight rip) - ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS, 
Conception (Has khan, not power metal but still), - I'd Be happy if Khan came back to metal and was in another Conception/ Kamelot style band.

"
"Bands that need to come back","Sanctuary doesn't have Loomis :(.Also I doubt Khan returning to the metal scene after retiring "
"Bands that need to come back","Thunderstone. I know they said they were making a new album and got their original singer back, but it's looking like it might not come out.

"Wow...","Just wanted to say I found this sub two days ago while looking on google to see if Sabaton had done any Napoleon songs.

Since then I've found Iced Earth, Civil War. And of course, Blind Guardian.

"Wow...","There are certainly things I would add (Angra), but almost every album in there is a classic in the genre and definitely deserving of its spot."
"Wow...","After listening to Heroes, I personally think it should replace Primo Victoria. That or Carolus Rex at the very least should replace it. "

"Wow...","Great, glad you have discovered the genre, I highly recommend listening to Demons &amp; Wizards as well if you are a big fan of Iced Earth and Blind Guardian, it is a side project with 2 albums by the vocalist for Blind Guardian and the lead guitarist of Iced Earth."

"Riot - Dance Of Death. Riot's pinnacle?",""
"Riot - Dance Of Death. Riot's pinnacle?","I consider Thundersteel to be their pinnacle, but this is a great follow up to such a superb album."
"Riot - Dance Of Death. Riot's pinnacle?","Thundersteel is also my favorite album of theirs, and Immortal Soul might actually top this one as well, but this song is probably my favorite Riot song. "
"Riot - Dance Of Death. Riot's pinnacle?","My two cents: The album could have been, but unfortunately isn't due to horrible execution.  If we take the straight power/speed songs on this album, and put it tick for tack against Thundersteel, I believe this album would crush it--it's the full actualization of that sound.  Unfortunately, that only accounts for maybe 50% of this album.  The weird experimentation with horns, the unnecessarily long noise/media intros (Should've taken a note out of Toxik's Think This and kept it short... it appeared this album was channeling Toxik to some degree to begin with just based on the cover art and concept) and the strikingly out of place hard rock and hair metal songs (Little Miss Death and Maryanne stand out as being particularly egregious) all sort of make this album fall flat of its true potential for me.  Should've been the best, but is ultimately dragged down by what are just flat out some of the most odd and mind boggling creative decisions in this band's (or any otherwise competent band's) history.  

But the songs that stand out, like this one, definitely rest at the top of Riot's creative output."

"Wizard out.","I'm stepping down as mod.

Didn't have the time.

Nor did I have the inclination to deal with the toddlerlike attitude of some members here.

I grew this place from 3 subs to 6883. All you see before you is my legacy.

Enjoy your subreddit.

I may pop in occasionally but to be honest I'm not really into Power Metal so much anymore so I doubt it.

Fare thee well~~~"
"Wizard out.","Thank you for all of your hard work, Wizard.  I hope to see you around every now and then.  And regardless of how much you are into power metal these days, remember:  always enjoy Blind Guardian!"
"Wizard out.","Responding to legitimate criticisms by calling them childish is, well, childish. Cya."
"Wizard out.","Honestly though the members are like 4% of the reason I left. 

It's more that I continue to not do shit that I should have been doing. Eventually I just had to sit down and recognise that I was no longer suited for the position. "

"Wizard out.","Why?  I see no reason for you to be done.  We now have multiple moderators, all of whom are active.  It has not been bad around here either; just inactive on the moderator side.  If you love power metal, stay!  No more drama about leaving and such.  Just stay.  Post when 'ya can.  Lurk around.

I see no good reason for you to leave at this point.  If I can't convince you and you are going to leave anyways, then I at least want to thank you for all of the hard work you have put in.  You've been a huge contributing member to this subreddit."

"Wizard out.","[MFW](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-13719-Don-t-go-where-I-can-t-follow-MIeX.gif).

I've been appreciating the hell out of your efforts in posting weekly threads. I've been getting into some heated arguments with many people here, but I don't think you're one of them.

Ideally I'd have you stay and keep writing weekly release threads. Because I love 'em. If you do end up leaving, I'd be okay with doing them myself."
"Wizard out.","Just out of morbid curiosity and obviously you don't need to even answer or acknowledge me. Why do you want to leave?

Btw, your work on this sub is always positive regardless of opinions."
"Wizard out.","What legitimate criticisms???? There is no need for moderation dumbass, its a small music sub. The sub looks fine, there's no spam or unrelated posts.. The only problem is you people constantly bitching and being over dramatic. The unlostHorizon guy is the worst about it"
"Wizard out.","Unlosthorizon's weekly ""The sky is falling!"" posts were always amusing. "
"Wizard out.","You, sir, have diarrhea of the keyboard."
"Wizard out.","That doesn't look like a legit criticism "
"Wizard out.",":(

I think the the only moderation I've missed lately is mostly mechanical stuff: sticky the new weekly release thread, unsticky the old one, post the vote, etc.

(I was tempted to just go ahead and put together a voting page myself, but I had no idea if I'd be duplicating effort, or if it would fall off the front page in a day.)

While I get as tired of some of the comments as anyone else, I don't think I've seen any that deserve to be deleted. I'd rather have a community than some thing sterile and unwilling to tolerate people having personalities."
"Wizard out.","Here is the reality of the situation, guys.

We've got a fairly small subreddit.  There are aspects about it which are nice, such as being our own little community, needing few rules, etc..  But the reality is, new people are going to be coming along, and we will be growing; so long as power metal is being released.

So I hope to find some sort of middle ground here.  The moderating that needs to be done in terms of negative users, posts, and comments is few and far between.  But that does not mean it should not be done.  I suppose I cannot speak for all of you, but I would like new members to be joining.  The more we grow, the better.  And the nice thing is, I do not believe we will ever grow enough to become a subreddit where there is no community, and no one is recognized.

But we will grow.  And there have been times where I feel if someone wanted to come check out this community and see if it is right for them, they would have looked at some of the posts and comments and thought ""nope"".  There is proof of this in some users within our community. This is true for every subreddit, not just us.  But that does not mean we should not strive to eliminate that.  Not much work needs to be done, though, and that is really nice.

On the other hand, there are some people who, to put frankly, have multiple sticks up their asses.  Some people who take things way too seriously, who get hurt by trolly comments.  You are who you are, and I understand that, but I strongly suggest trying to harden yourself a little; we're a community and we'll joke around and poke fun at each other, try not to take it too personally.  It is going to continue, and that is the nature of some people.  They do not mean any harm by it.

Anyways, I hope to have found some middle-ground between those who are upset at what has happened, and those who are upset at the people who are upset.  Is it as serious as some people make it out to be?  No.  But are there legitimate concerns?  Yes; especially if we want to continue to grow."

"Blind Guardian- Mr. Sandman (Warning: Clowns)","One of the most popular bands in the genre hasn't released a single for a bit over 3 years. It's unsurprising that within the few months we got TotG and the actual album, BG spiked a bit because people remembered the band exists and got excited.

If you look at the weekly top list, 3 posts on the first page are related to Blind Guardian, only one is a song by them(Noldor) and the other 2 are from a side project(Demons &amp; Wizards)."
"Blind Guardian- Mr. Sandman (Warning: Clowns)","...and if you look at the monthly top list, you'll see the following:

a song by Nightwish, a song by Rhapsody, a song by Blind Guardian, Blind Guardian new album stream, a song by Blind Guardian, a link to the Blind Guardian AMA, a song by Blind Guardian, two songs by Symphony X, a song by Alestorm, a post about modding, two songs by Sonata Arctica, a song by Stratovarius, a post about Blind Guardian, the powermetal awards (aka a post about Blind Guardian), two posts about Avantasia, Blind Guardian official album discussion, a post about Blind Guardian, a song by Demons &amp; Wizards, a song by Amon Amarth and Avantasia.

...and if you look at the top posts of all time you have the following:

Dragonland and Keldian AMA, two posts about Pentakill (the fuck?), 1 song by Nightwish, 1 by Rhapsody and 1 by Helloween, four joke posts (two about dragonforce, one about sabaton), 3 Sabaton songs / posts and 11 Blind Guardian related posts.

"Blind Guardian- Mr. Sandman (Warning: Clowns)","The monthly and all-time tops are to be expected.

BG is one of the most popular bands in the genre. If you go to /r/progmetal, are you surprised their top of all time encompasses the genres most popular bands? Or if you go to /r/metal you see the same trend?

The monthly top hits the release of their album, not at all surprising. I wonder what it'd look like if you took the first page of the monthly top submissions from all weeks of january 2013 and up to now to see if it spikes as much.

If you look at the time stamps on the top submissions, that kinda follows what I'm saying. I just looked through the 4 first pages(100 submissions) and I got this graph: [link](http://i.imgur.com/xzH7202.png). There's 28 entries in total. While that does indicate BG is very popular on this subreddit historically, do note that 12 of those falls within the last 4 months and 7 are not older than a month. That's 43% of all submissions in the time surrounding the release of TotG and the album. A graph that would show the number of submissions per month over eg 2 years, may be a better indicator, but I'm not capable of writing that scraper."

I think Hansi seriously needs to work on getting himself some sustain. If you're going to belting a lot like this you need some kind of vibrato.

1\. **Best Album: [Falconer - Black Moon Rising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXhJhoxdpzY)**

Upon the release of the first single, 'Locust Swarm,' I admit I was skeptical. Unlike others, the song didn't immediately grab a hold of me, and I'd say it remains in the bottom two tracks of this album, though it has grown on me. However, this album was ultimately stunning to me. The riffs are energetic, the vocals are buttery and outstanding, the solos do a great job of releasing the energy the songs build up. While it has its comparatively weaker moments, the album remains strong throughout, and it does a great job with pacing. There's a great mix of all out power metal energy, folk inspiration, heavy riffing, and calmer moments. The result is not just my favorite album of the year, but Falconer's best album yet, and a work which should be heralded as among the best this subgenre has to offer.

*Runners up: Persuader - The Fiction Maze, Disforia - The Age of Ether, Triosphere - The Heart of the Matter*

2\. **Best Song: [Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep1B_aIFPDE)**

(Disclaimer: I am a proud participant in the Blind Guardian circlejerk!) When Blind Guardian puts something out, it's not even really fair. They are the gold standard for the genre. Hansi's vocals contain an unmatched ferocity, and André's songwriting contains a unique combination of complexity and catchiness which I've yet to find another band capable of matching. Twilight of the Gods is an excellent demonstration of these qualities as the gods of power metal relentlessly pump out energetic riffs, and engaging solo, and, of course, beautiful layered vocal work.

*Runners up: Freedom Call - Beyond, Persuader - One Lifetime, Sabaton - No Bullets Fly*

3\. **Best Male Vocalist: [Jens Carlsson \(Persuader\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICLgZfAISI)**

I suppose, given my deep love for the vocals of Hansi Kürsch, it's not surprising that this be given to someone who's often compared to Blind Guardian's vocalist. But to give that as Carlsson's greatest claim would be unfair, as he is a fantastic vocalist in his own right, and I actually think this is the album where he sounds least like Hansi. His clean vocals are fierce and powerful, and he complements them with more than competent harsh vocals on occasion. 

*Runners up: John Yelland (Disforia), Vasilis Georgiou (Black Fate), Sir Robert (Noble Beast)*

4\. **Best Female Vocalist: [Ida Haukland \(Triosphere\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqFtlAnhzu8)**

Female vocals in metal are usually operatic, or they take their feminine qualities and push them as far as they can go. Not Ida - these vocals are rough and aggressive! They work with Triosphere's excellent riffs very well, and provide an energy that even many male vocalists fail to match. Ida is a great example that female vocals can not only be fit for metal, but that they can molded for and excel in this genre.

*Runners up: Dianne van Giersbergen (Xandria), Emily Alice Ovenden (Pythia)*

5\. **Best Solo: [DragonForce - The Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7F3SU5BRw)**

DragonForce is a band principally known for solos, and I can't say that I've found as much worth in them as others. However, with this track, DragonForce is doing something actually fairly alien to not only their sound, but power metal in general. Even more surprising: it works and I like it quite a bit! There's energy and DragonForce's typical technicality, but also a sort of downward chaos that fits the themes of the song quite well.

*Runners up: Kamijo - Heart, Noble Beast - Iron Clad Angels, Sonata Arctica - Running Lights*

6\. **Best Comeback: [Persuader - The Fiction Maze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdaZ4yWR3k8)**

It was eight long years since Persuader's last album, but not only did they come back - they came back near flawlessly! The Fiction Maze would be my album of the year if not for Black Moon Rising. While many of the bands that have put out albums more frequently have stagnated, Persuader came in with something that's aggressive, heavy, and exciting. While it does feel like we skipped a step in their growth over those eight years, what we have leaves little to want for.

*Runner up: Freedom Call - Beyond*

7\. **Most WTF: [Moonrise: A Symphonic Metal Opera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBvl-AdnHGY)**

Pretty good orchestration, fun riffs... and My Little Pony? I only have a passing familiarity with the Brony phenomenon, and I'm not too sure what to make of this. Power metal isn't at all alien to cheesy stories, so at least it's not too out of place.

8\. **Most Unexpected: [Pentakill - Smite &amp; Ignite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUiOylPbfV0)**

If you told me that Jørn Lande, ZP Theart, and Derek Sherinian were going to appear on an album together this year, I would've asked where I had missed the Avantasia announcement. If you told me that album was going to be from Riot Games and based on a band in League of Legends, I would have laughed in your face! The result isn't amazing, but it's competent power metal with some pretty good songs.

*Runner up: Freedom Call - Beyond [Because who expected them to be that good again?!]*

9\. **Best album art: [Falconer - Black Moon Rising](http://i.imgur.com/BKZGxtH.jpg)**

I love the artistry, the use of color, and the details that manage that not to detract from the focus of the art... but most of all: *that falcon!*

*Runner up: Sabaton - Heroes (Special Edition)*

10\. **Biggest Disappointment: [Gamma Ray - Empire of the Undead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkF-ErMnwNo)**

Oh, Gamma Ray, won't you please release something excellent again? Ok, to be fair this album was a big step up from their last couple of releases, but they seemed to have lost their spirit after 2005's Majestic. There was hope for this album, but it's still not quite yet. What's worse is that there are moments which could have fit very well into an excellent album, but they prove to only tease the listener for what could have been. Hopefully Kai Hansen proves next time why he's in the power metal pantheon!

*Runner up: Edguy - Space Police (Defenders of the Crown)*

11\. **Most Likely to Be Forced Onto Your iTunes Account by Apple/Labels: [Amaranthe - Massive Addiction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AHiZ2g6FyE)**

This label-generated metalcore/pop bullshit isn't even power metal! Olof, I want my Dragonland!!!

*Runner up: DragonForce - Maximum Overload*

12\. **Most Anticipated: [Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvH9vC66P6M)**

The proper return of the gods awaits! Beyond the Red Mirror promises quality songwriting, amazing vocals, thrilling orchestrations, wonderful choirs... you get the point! Beyond the Red Mirror is also Hansi's first attempt at a concept album based on his own story, one based off of an idea he had in *Imaginations from the Other Side* twenty years ago! The glimpses we've had promise true grandeur!

*Runners up: Orden Ogan - Ravenhead, Symphony X - TBA*

13\. **Best Fantasy Book: [Brandon Sanderson - Words of Radiance](http://brandonsanderson.com/books/the-stormlight-archive/words-of-radiance/)**

Given the heavy role that fantasy plays in power metal, I thought it appropriate to highlight other avenues of that genre as well. Starting out, we have Brandon Sanderson's Words of Radiance, book two in his *Stormlight Archive* and a sequel
to *The Way of Kings*. The first book I thought was good, but not great, but this one is the book which really shows that this series has promise. Maybe Hansi will one day write some lyrics based on it?

14\. **Best Fantasy - Other Medium: [Dragon Age : Inquisition](http://www.dragonage.com/#!/en_US/home)**

DA:I is the third main entry in the Dragon Age series, following the amazing Dragon Age: Origins and the rather lackluster Dragon Age 2. Don't worry though, Bioware has returned to much of their former glory with Inquisition. While the gameplay isn't quite what I'd like it to be, it's still very fun. The story, if generic, is interesting enough - and good Creator is there a whole lot of lore to consume! That's all combined with a good deal of content and fantastic visuals, both with art design and graphics.

*Runners up: Divinity: Original Sin, HBO's Game of Thrones (Season Four)*

15\. **Best Non-Power Metal: [Devin Townsend Project - Z^2 : Sky Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRFHR19EW34)**

If Amaranthe is a lesson in how *not* to do pop metal, the Devin Townsend Project has increasingly become a lesson in how to do it properly. Sky Blue isn't a very intricate album, but it is fun, varied, and reflective. It's surprising that the disc which at first was just an obligation to the studio turned out to be, by far, the better of the two Z^2 albums.

*Runners up: The Glitch Mob - Love Death Immortality, Opeth - Pale Communion, Devin Townsend - Casualties of Cool*


"
"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","Excellent way to do a list. I appreciate it being different and simple to get into.

Feedback wise;

I'm sad to see you put Gamma Ray as a disappointment. Although the album was not an instant classic like most of their albums are, it was a huge step up from the ""shot and tired"" sounding vocals from To The Metal.

Even Edguy wasn't terrible. Not a must have (something I don't think they've had since Rocket Ride) but not an embarassing effort. It is a step in a more Power Metal direction, rather than a ""We're a Hard Rock band now"" direction.

But Freedom Call was THAT good this year? I just got back into the swing of listening to them and was unsure if newer material was any good. (I fell off at about Dimensions and have everything before, minus their first album) but I will have to search it out when I can."
"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","Gamma Ray: It isn't just the vocals, everything about them has been off since Majesty for whatever reason. Empire of the Undead is the best of the three albums since, and it isn't a bad album... I just know that Kai Hansen &amp; Co. are capable of putting out material that is so much better. Unfortunately they just haven't shown it for nine years now... that's what it's the biggest disappointment. 

Edguy: I actually generally like newer Edguy, and like Gamma Ray this wasn't an awful album. Just a lackluster one, and I get the feeling it was rushed out. With a bit more effort, it would've been a strong album.

Freedom Call: Yes! It was actually rather surprising how good this album was given that I've found their recent albums not worth listening to."
"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","Fair enough on Gamma Ray, although I would argue that Land of the Free II was an excellent album.

Edguy I felt that too. Some stuff was good, but it could have been better. It's how I felt for Age of the Joker; good but should be better."
"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","Woo, Falconer at best album *and* best album art. I couldn't agree more. :D

Sort of surprised that Mathias Blad didn't get honorable mentions for **Best Male Vocalist**

Either way, great list. Good job :D"
"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","Haha, thanks for catching my error! As I noted before I delved in, Falconer and Blind Guardian weren't eligible for categories 3, 4, and 5. For best male vocalist, it otherwise would have been Hansi, then Mathias."
"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","Ah, didn't catch that bit at the top the first time around, sorry about that. 

Hansi then Mathias, good to hear it :D"

"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","aww ;)"
"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","Interesting list, I rather liked the presentation of it too. Top X lists can be great but also over abundant so it's great seeing someone break the mould. I especially like your inclusion of non-music related entries. I know Brandon Sanderson only by his reputation for completing the *Wheel of Time* series, I haven't yet had the chance to read anything by him. This is pushing me to want to dive into the *Stormlight Archive* over my holiday break.

Also, I'm going to have to re-listen to Persuader. I keep hearing good things about it but when I listened to a few tracks I wasn't captivated. Could be I was just overly distracted at the time."
"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","[deleted]"
"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","Ok, so i'm currently reading The Way of Kings and i'm having trouble committing to it.  Mainly because the books start out with one of the coolest fantasy characters I have ever come across(Szeth) and then instantly abandons him and we get stuck with boring ass Dalinar.  

I gather from your post that this is a series I should stick with though.


Also, solid music selections.  Especially picking Ida.  I think i'm in love  with her.  "
"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","You will see more of him, so at least there's that to look forward to.

My big issue with *The Way of Kings* is its slow pacing. I normally don't have an issue with slow books, but I just didn't find it terribly interesting in WoK. I think the series will prove itself, though, as it's already beginning to with WoR."
"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","Yeah, its extremely slow right now. I understand its needed to get us in the world hes trying to build, but he could spice it up a bit.  "
"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","I like that you included a book and video game entries. And I agree 100% with your choices there. *Word of Radiance* was amazing and is my book of the year, but it's the only 2014 book I've read so that's not really fair I guess, haha. I think I would stick with it anyway if I had read other 2014 releases. 

Dragon Age: Inquisition, while I haven't yet finished it, I think it's going to be my GOTY 2014, it's just so freaking good. At least definitely the best fantasy game I've played this year. "
"Edledhron's Two Thousand Fourteen in Power Metal!!","Nothing in Power Metal this year really stood out for me (probably because I took a break from the genre this year to find other stuff) but my favorite vocalist of the year are Ryan Boc (Sequester), Ardraos (Suhnopfer), and Wulf (Neurotech). My favorite Power Metal album is Pariah's Child (given that it's the only one I really payed attention to unless Skyforest's debut album counts). Sakharov - Under My April Moon, My Material Season - Awakening to the Piano Dramatic and Katse - Perusta are also some good ones. My album of the year is Suhnopfer - Offertoire, and my other favorite non-Power Metal albums are Sequester - Missing Image, Mechina - Xenon, Neurotech - Infra Versus Ultra, and Mare Cognitum - Phobos Monolith. "

"Allen Lande - Where Have The Angels Gone|| Underrated Gem!","Just when researching the album it's popularity wasn't exactly high xD"
"Allen Lande - Where Have The Angels Gone|| Underrated Gem!","Wouldn't call this underrated. It received praise across the board when it came out. If you're referring to in r/powermetal that's probably because it's not really power metal. "
"Allen Lande - Where Have The Angels Gone|| Underrated Gem!","Yeah, it's melodic heavy metal, or something."
"Allen Lande - Where Have The Angels Gone|| Underrated Gem!","Yer I wasn't sure what it was either...I think melodic heavy metal is a good description ^_^ - I just thought it was a great song that needed some love haha "
"Allen Lande - Where Have The Angels Gone|| Underrated Gem!","I would say it's power metal. It has Russell Allen, Jorn, and Magnus Karlsson (guitarist). It's not as bombastic as some other power metal, but I'm not big on taxonomy anyway. Although almost all good metal is ""melodic,"" so throwing ""melodic"" in front of everything doesn't do much in my opinion. You guys should check out Magnus Karlsson's other work too. He's a phenomenal guitarist featured on the first three Allen Lande albums, the latest few Primal Fear albums, and he has a solo album, Free Fall, with guest singers. "
"Allen Lande - Where Have The Angels Gone|| Underrated Gem!","Yes! I absolutely LOVE his guitar style...it's right up my alley - I've got his solo album which I'm going to listen to soon but I really wanna check out his other stuff :)

[To the Metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2Z8cjlLCo) is a ballad that might feel a bit awkward at first because he sings at full volume with just a guitar behind him, but it's pretty catchy.

"Borealis launches Kickstarter for new album/tour",""
"Borealis launches Kickstarter for new album/tour","As much as I love the band's music, this doesn't look like a great kickstarter. The goal itself is rather vague. It seems to be for a tour, but the project is 'album/tour?' Is there anything connected to the album about this, aside from the tour following the album's release? And what is the tour? A few cities in Canada? An extensive North America tour? European festivals?

The rewards are iffy too. The band will do 'anything' for $200? For an amount 100x that, I could see that be an award tier, but that's way to vague for an amount that's simultaneously quite large and low. The $35 award tier is good for that rare category of people who a) wants to support the band in this way and b)doesn't own their music yet. Most importantly, it's missing out on the perfect backer-award, which would be a copy of their new album, optionally signed at a slight premium cost.

I wish these guys success in their effort, I just also wish that this kickstarter looked more appealing."
"Borealis launches Kickstarter for new album/tour","I fully agree with you. I'm actually against crowdfunding in general, but Borealis is one of two bands (the other being Crimson Shadows) that I will support through crowdfunding.

If I were to guess, I would imagine they'd go for a North American tour rather than a European one. I think they are decently connected in the power metal world, and it would not be a huge stretch for them to get on a tour, but I would not contribute with the expectation of them hitting a particular city. It's actually kinda strange because based on the updates we've received, I was under the impression the album is pretty much done, so the only costs left would be pressing. 

I too am surprised at the lack of perks related to the new album, but maybe they aren't sure when it would be done yet. The only saving grace I see related to this Kickstarter is that it's only funded if they meet their goal. 

Much in the way people will buy 10 different editions of the new Blind Guardian, I'd pretty much do the equivalent for Borealis here. I really love their music."
"Borealis launches Kickstarter for new album/tour","I'll bug them to put the new album as a reward.

"Borealis launches Kickstarter for new album/tour","I will definitely be contributing, I'm just having trouble deciding which perk I want. 

I'm really curious as to what they have in mind for the $200 perk because this is one of the only bands I'd shell out that kind of money for."

"What on Earth is Beyond The Red Mirror about?",""
"What on Earth is Beyond The Red Mirror about?","I haven't listened to the album yet (Tuesday!!) but I know the general concept: On *Imaginations from the Other Side* we meet a boy who's kind of a loner and doesn't get along well with his family ('Bright Eyes'). One day he meets a stranger who introduces him to a magical mirror ('And the Story Ends'), though the mirror is truly a gateway to another world where the boy is destined to be king/the chosen one. However, the boy has sort of a doppelgänger in that world based on the worst parts of his personality. The boy has to make a choice: jump through the mirror or stay. He decides to stay, leading both worlds into chaos and disorder over the next twenty years while the gateways between the worlds all eventually close except the Red Mirror. The now grown up boy has to regain his memory and find a way to the other world, meanwhile his Modred-like counterpart is making efforts to improve his world.

The big influences behind it seem to be *The Chronicles of Narnia* and *Le Morte d'Arthur.*"
"What on Earth is Beyond The Red Mirror about?","Just looking at it, I would also say Stephen King's ""The Talisman"".

"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","Jesus Christ. Every time I think I'm good at guitar or singing, I come across videos that make me realize I'm not even in the same universe.

EDIT: That was the most metal thing I've listened to this year."
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","I love the drumming part at the end. "
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","You should listen to what [they were putting out together before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzGR2N5GWbA). 

Edit: Was factually inaccurate about band history."
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","Uhhhhhh The Bard's Song rings any bells?"
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","I like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAc4mfuVRo8) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXkSuQ8b7zc), basically the whole album."
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","That *My Selene* cover is cringe-worthy. Ooof."
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","I wonder if its a cover when the guy who wrote it is playing it."
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","I wish he was the one doing the singing. Jani is a pretty damn good vocalist.

I really like Kotipelto and I'll defend him against all the haters, but, oh man, he sounds awful on that song."
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","I agree that this isnt Timos best performance. Luckily Cains Offering 2 is just around the corner!"

"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","whoever wrote lyrics for this album is a freaking genius "
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","Everything except the voice acting, which is absolutely atrocious. "
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","What, would you rather it be Christopher Lee?"
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","I'd rather they just removed the voice acting entirely. Is there a version of the song without it?"
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","Sadly there isnt. I remember reading on their forum where someone made this question, and Andreas Blomqvist himself stated that there are no alternate versions."
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","Anyone with talent i guess. The doctor sounds annoyed by the wife asking him about her dying husband, which is ridiculous. There isnt credible distress in her voice, it really pulls you out of the atmosphere cause its so bad."
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","Well, we need to remember whoever was doing the narration, wasn't born in an English speaking country so it's going to sound a bit cheesy. I actually like the voice acting, it isn't perfect and the doctor and his wife sound like ordinary people which helps me to become more caught up in the concept."
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","To each his own I guess. The sequence where she tells him that its not his kid is for me a great example of just how bad it is. It just feels like 2 people pretending to care."
"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","I just listened to it again. That ""What?!"" right at the end before the car crash is reallllly fucking bad. Like who even thought that would be a good idea, and did they do more than one take of it. "

Because I am a huge, huge, huge fan of acoustic metal stuff and this is probably the best I've found:

"Seventh Wonder - One Last Goodbye| | Best acoustic song ever?","[Shadow Gallery - Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-xBJ0FBvpg) is one of my favorite acoustic songs.   
Also it's not power but Pain of Salvation just released an acoustic album called Falling Home that I'd recommend you check out if you haven't heard it."

"Galneryus - Scars","An absolutely amazing song with one of the most emotional choruses I have ever heard (especially in the ending).

Still have zero idea what Sho is saying. "
"Galneryus - Scars","Yeah I fucking love the chorus. This is probably my favorite song from that album. T.F.F.B. is fucking amazing too. And No More Tears. And Wind Blows. And Time Has Come.
