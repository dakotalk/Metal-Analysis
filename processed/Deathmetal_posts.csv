"What got you into death metal","For me it was Bolt Thrower - Those Once Loyal

I was new to metal and was listening to crap like Disturbed and such and I asked a friend who is into mostly old school to name some death and thrash metal bands and among the first ones he named was Bolt Thrower. I fell in love and been listening to DM for years now. And In metal I got by purchasing a Rammstein CD by accident.

Also, is it just me or did your first few bands decided the sound of DM you like? Ever since I started listening to DM I always preferred war themed DM that is sluggish and heavy with deep growls."
"What got you into death metal","Decapitated- Spheres of Madness

As well as going to my first metal show, Cannibal Corpse and Dying Fetus in 06. "
"What got you into death metal","Bolt Thrower \m/"
"What got you into death metal","Cryptopsy - None So Vile and Whisper Supremacy"
"What got you into death metal","cannibal corpse's cover of no remorse"
"What got you into death metal","Death, only Death, more Death, All Death."
"What got you into death metal","Death and Morbid Angel"
"What got you into death metal","Bolt Thrower is a beautiful beginning : - ) It was them , Amon Amarth , and Nile . I no longer listen to Amon Amarth . "
"What got you into death metal","I can listen to AM occasionally but they're not my type of melodic DM. Tech death I can't stand."
"What got you into death metal","Finding Sepultura - Beneath the Remains &amp; Suffocation - Effigy of the Forgotten on cassette at a flea market back in 1992... Bought them based on the album art alone.. "
"What got you into death metal","I went from mainstream rock/metal (Disturbed, etc) to Dethklok, then Arch Enemy, then Amon Amarth. And then Behemoth! 

Behemoth has remained a favorite and now I also love Dying Fetus, Bloodbath, Dragged into Sunlight, Dead Congregation, etc."
"What got you into death metal","That Dead Congregation album is my album of the year. "
"What got you into death metal","It's one of the best in 2014, yes."
"What got you into death metal","I first heard DM in Ace Ventura Pet detective (there's a brief scene that takes place at a Cannibal Corpse show) and thought it was fake. Years later my buddy gifted me an album and told me I ""needed to hear it"" because of how ""ridiculous"" it was. That album was None So Vile by Cryptopsy. At first I agreed. How was this even music? I mean, those vocals....wtf is that shit? But hey, wait, that drumming is really good, let's keep listening.....hmmm....so is the guitar work.....and the bass.....just ignore the vocals.....ignore the vocals......ignore the voc-actually, now that I'm 4 or 5 listens in to the album the vocals kind of make sense.....few more go rounds and now the vocals are actually kind of cool.....etc

Years later I am still a diehard dm fan. "
"What got you into death metal","I was introduced to Six Feet Under in college and really dug it, but I made a lifelong friend at a party that introduced me to Dying Fetus. I soon began listening to anything and everything death metal. "
"What got you into death metal","It was a slow progression.  As a teen in the mid-1990s, I got into popular rock music which was then grunge followed by crappy nu-metal bands.  I wanted heavier and faster! I started listening to Slayer. By 2000, I started listening to black metal like Emperor and Darkthrone.  Because I was already listening to extreme metal, I decided to give death metal a try.  I had always known about bands like Cannibal Corpse through the media, but they were inaccessible to me before my black metal phase.

I bought Tomb of the Mutilated in probably 2001, and the rest is history.

By the way, OP, have you listened to War Master from Houston? You'd probably like it."
"What got you into death metal","Heh. I was the same with the nu metal shit (korn, slipknot, etc) but then moved on to Opeth, somehow got a hold of Nocturnus (The Key), and the Jester Race."
"What got you into death metal","Nu-metal was just everywhere at that time.  Before we all had the internet and the internet was even mature enough to allow us to research stuff online, it was natural.  Kids today don't realize how easy they have it when it comes to finding good music.  The Jester Race was also big in my transition to real metal.  Cheers."
"What got you into death metal","Indeed I did. They kick ass."
"What got you into death metal","Constant diet of Morbid Angel - Altars of Madness back in high school."
"What got you into death metal","Breakfast of fucking champs right there! "
"What got you into death metal","Deicide - Legion. It was released in -92, I maybe first heard it in -96 or something.

Parents and teachers told me to stay the fuck away from this album, cause of the lyrics and it's theme. Let's just say I did not. 

Still one of the greatest death metal-albums today."
"What got you into death metal","That may be my #1 of all time. It's so ridiculously good it's not funny."
"What got you into death metal","Slayer -&gt; In Flames -&gt; Death -&gt; Morbid Angel -&gt; Cryptopsy -&gt; etc..."
"What got you into death metal","Hearing about a band called **Cannibal Corpse** and looking up their song lyrics (mostly the songs off of *Eaten Back to Life*) in my Visual Basic class in High School. After reading the lyrics I just HAD to listen to the songs. Once I did I was instantly hooked.



It certainly has decided the sound of the DM I like. I lean more towards the Cannibal Corpse sound and instantly like everything that sounds like them. "
"What got you into death metal","by the looks of it, im a bit older than most of you replying. reign in blood came out while i was in the 9th grade. thrash (slayer, sadus, kreator, etc) lead directly to death metal. the first wave of death bands came out late high school for me. Slowly We Rot, Altars of Madness and Leprosy were among the very first i remember hearing. i've been listening to it since basically the beginning. not to sound like a hipster dildo."
"What got you into death metal","Deicide-Bible Basher"
"What got you into death metal","Cannibal Corpse - The Bleeding"
"What got you into death metal","Back in the mid-90s a high school buddy always wore metal shirts to school (Deicide, Obituary, Morbid Angel, and Slayer, most notably).  I was all about crap like Pantera at the time, but out of curiosity decided to purchase a Deicide CD (specifically Deicide:  Amon - Feasting the Beast) from a local store and the rest is history."
"What got you into death metal","It was a natural progression for me. I'm 16 and I've been listening to metal literally all my life. My parents frequented Pantera, Sepultura, Cannibal Corpse and Metallica when I was little and it just stuck with me. The real path to more extreme stuff that my parents wouldn't listen to began when I was about 11 and really liked Slipknot, which led to Rammstein, which led to Carcass which led to everything else afterwards."
"What got you into death metal","Your parents listened to cannibal corpse but nu metal was too extreme?"
"What got you into death metal","I'm talking about ""kvlt"" stuff, or heavier dm . They listened to Slipknot too, I was just saying that was where I really started on my path to what I listen to now."
"What got you into death metal","I was touring w a little bullshit punk rock gig and played a number of shows with the Gentleman homicide. Mathy, grindy, technical and aggressive as fuck on stage. Fuck that they were a Christian band, that's incidental, we all were at that age. Before that I thought metal was only as heavy as mudvayne and local shit so my world was blown. "
"What got you into death metal","I got into metal about 12 years ago because of Symphony X, then got into other prog and power bands. Listened to Opeth, got into Mastodon, etc. I nthink my first actual death metal band was Amon Amarth... who really aren't that death metal when you analyze them in comparison with death metal and power metal bands, haha. Then from Amon Amarth I got into really techy wank, Gorod, Necrophagist, etc, then brutal, like Suffocation, now my favorite is the ""occult death metal"" or ""caverncore"" stuff like Antediluvian or Portal."
"What got you into death metal","Portal is probably the most evil thing I have ever heard."
"What got you into death metal","The Body's ep ""Master, We Perish"" is pretty evil sounding. Its sludge/doom, though."
"What got you into death metal","Cannibal Corpse. All of it, I guess. I had just gotten into Napster and was trying out something different that I heard an older guy at school talk about, I think Mummified in Barbed Wire was the first track I downloaded, just kinda got out of control after that."
"What got you into death metal","It's a cross between the song Hell March from Red Alert and the soundtrack to The Matrix. There wasn't any death metal on it, but it got me into Marilyn Manson and Rammstein, and that started my downward spiral into the grimdark realm of swords and blood that we know as death metal."
"What got you into death metal","Cannibal Corpse kind of got me into it, I mean I was sort of listening to it off and on for quite a few years. But then I found Deicide and that got me hooked big time"
"What got you into death metal","  I was into stuff like Slipknot, Lamb Of God, Killswitch Engage etc then I some how ended up downloading No Warning Shot from Six Feet Under and A Skull Full Of Maggots from Corpse and really dug the sound. 
  A few weeks later I picked up a sampler from Relapse Records cause I liked the cover art and the band names and was introduced to Dying Fetus, Suffocation, Origin, Cephalic Carnage, Regurgitate and a ton of others and I've been all about death metal ever since "
"What got you into death metal","For me it was Obituary's The End Complete back in 93. Before that the heaviest thing I had listened to was Seasons in the Abyss.  "
"What got you into death metal","[deleted]"
"What got you into death metal","Dismember- Override the Overture. Well, ""Like an Everflowing Stream"" in general.

I was probably about 14, at the time I was really into the some of the old HydraHead bands (Coalesce, Botch, Drowningman, and Neurosis). I was at the music store in the mall, and was sifting through the ""used"" bin. I found ""Like an Everflowing Stream,"" thought it looked rad, bought it, and it changed my life. Was literally a trap door directly into the death metal, and I was hooked."
"What got you into death metal","As far back as I can remember (when I was about 5 or 6) I listened to Slayer and Cannibal Corpse. When the internet took off, my death metal palate exploded and there's been no going back."
"What got you into death metal","The fast tempo chuggy bass and guitar, first time I heard it I was like: **WTF?! This sounds fucking SICK** And I started playing Death Metal on my guitar, and started loving Pig Squeeling/Growling eventually, which I want to do myself now actually."
"What got you into death metal","I worked my way up from panthera to death "
"What got you into death metal","My buddy found this weird band called Dying Fetus on Spotify, and we listened to it as a joke. I actually liked it and now am addicted to it. "
"What got you into death metal","I was into punk rock and wanted to get into metal, so I asked a friend for some recommendations. He gave me cassettes of ""Individual Thought Patterns"" and ""Seven Churches"". My first car only had a cassette player, and those were my only two tapes, so I spent the next year just alternating between those two on my commute to work. It all went downhill from there."
"What got you into death metal","In Flames ""Colony"" was the first DM record I really got into, which was a good intro for someone who already liked melodic guitar stuff like Blind Guardian and so forth.  I wish they still actually played death metal... or even like... anything worth listening to."
"What got you into death metal","I kinda like them up to A Sense Of Purpose. Didn't even listen to the last album."
"What got you into death metal","A few of my early favorite albums were Bloodbath - Nightmares Made Flesh, Amon Amarth - Fate of Norns, Hate Eternal - I Monarch, and Nile - Annihilation of the wicked. Before that i was more into bands like Lamb of God, Mastodon, Unearth and Slipknot but after discovering death metal i was hooked"
"What got you into death metal","Entombed - Left Hand Path.

Always liked metal, don't know what made me pick this CD up one day, but I've been hooked ever since."
"What got you into death metal","Bolt Thrower - Shreds of Sanity

Warmaster is still my favorite Bolt Thrower record. "
"What got you into death metal","Make them suffer by Cannibal Corpse

Before I started listening to death/black/thrash metal i listened to metalcore like AILD and Killswitch. Any death metal I heard like Hammer Smashed Face I didn't like the vocals. They just seemed to low in the mix and inaudible. Then I started to listen to Amon Amarth and I warmed up to growling. Then I gave more death metal a try and Make Them Suffer really sold it for me. It was just such straightforward brutality and I'd never heard anything like it. Then I started listening to bands like Deicide, Morbid Angel, Opeth and Carcass."
"What got you into death metal","Thy Art Is Murder was the first deathmetal band I ever actualy was a fan of"
"What got you into death metal","I always loved good fast metal, but when I heard Eaten Back to Life...I was hooked."
"What got you into death metal","When I was in 8th grade I was at HMV or some shit like that when I saw Vile, I'd heard other metal bands but they were metalcore- nu metal type shit so this was completely new and life changing, I played the CD on repeat for a month. 

This completely broadened my spectrum I really got in Dying Fetus shortly after as well as Bloodbath, Morbid Angel, Skinless. "

"What got you into death metal","A.N.U.S."
"What got you into death metal","Job for a cowboy - Suspended by the throat was the gateway for me. It was pretty random after that. I got into Slipknot, whitechapel, black dahlia murder, ensiferum, behemoth, immortal, etc. "

"Any bands looking for logos?","I don't know if this is the right place to post this question, but I plan on going to school for graphic design and I'd like to build my portfolio with death metal logos. It's always been a dream of mine to make logos for bands. I have made one so far that is being used by a local band around my area actively and 2 for my close friends ([check it out on my barren facebook page, band is The Whales and the other 2 are Nebularion and Octobrya](https://www.facebook.com/witchcultdesigns)).

I will be doing this for free as this is just amateur work but due to that I'd only be able to take a few projects at a time. Thanks for your time and if you're interested, just drop a line in this thread and we can go from there.

If I am in violation of some subreddit rule, I apologize. I'll delete the post if that's the case.


Edit: grammar"

"Can anyone identify this song?","I think it was an original piece that was written for the show specifically by the people in charge of music for the show. There doesn't seem to be any indication that they hired a band to record it or used an pre-written song. Sorry, man."

Some bands/albums I really like:



[Cannibal Corpse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibal_Corpse): [Eaten Back to Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaten_Back_to_Life), [The Bleeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bleeding), [Vile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vile_(album)), [Bloodthirst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodthirst), [Gore Obsessed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gore_Obsessed), [The Wretched Spawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wretched_Spawn), [Kill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_(album)), and [Evisceration Plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evisceration_Plague). I haven't really listened to [Torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_(album)) and I haven't heard any of there new stuff yet.



[Behemoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behemoth_(band)) - [Demigod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demigod_(album)), [The Apostasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apostasy), and [The Satanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanist_(album)). I like songs off of their older albums as well but these are my favorites.



I really Like [Beheaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beheaded_(band))'s Elapsed in the Vortex of Extinction but I haven't listend to the rest of [Never to Dawn](http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Beheaded/Never_to_Dawn/354638) yet.



I really like [Fallujah](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Fallujah/3540255104)'s Saphire but I hear all of [The_Flesh_Prevails](http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Fallujah/The_Flesh_Prevails/412147) sounds very similar. I have not listened to it yet.



I like some of [Hypocrisy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy_(band))'s [End of Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_Disclosure) but I can't seem to get into their older work. Maybe I'm not listining to the right albums.



I like a lot of [Morbid Angel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbid_Angel)'s older work but their new album is just god awful. Same with [Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slayer).



I can be more specifc if needed (like listing my favorite songs).



Based on this, recommend some songs/albums/bands that you think I will like."
"Recommend me some metal","Suffocation - [Effigy of the Forgotten](http://youtu.be/bLorNSZjcBI)

Nox - [Ixaxaar](http://youtu.be/LJ_vUUvRiUs)

Immolation - [Close to a World Below](http://youtu.be/HPQL2mhK79k)

Incantation - [Onward to Golgotha](http://youtu.be/hfo-TE4qX6w)

Ulcerate - [Everything is Fire](http://youtu.be/uQlHHEde-ho)

Aosoth - [III: Violence and Variation](http://youtu.be/gwIzGc9eJ1E) (Not death metal, but you said you liked Behemoth, who are blackened death, so fuck it. One of my favorite album ever)"
"Recommend me some metal","I like Suffocation, just didn't list them here. I'll have to check out the rest. I do like Blackened Death Metal a lot. I love Behemoth and Belphegor so I'm sure I will like Aosoth. Thank for the recommendations!"
"Recommend me some metal","I really like Nox and Ulcerate. Thanks for recommending them!



I'm still a bit iffy on Immolation. I'm going to have to listen to more from them to be sure.



I thought Incantation was pretty good too.



However, Aosoth was a bit too Black Metal for me.



Thanks for the recommendations though!"
"Recommend me some metal","Check out Nile . Their Record called ""Annihilation of the Wicked"" is a great Starting-Point if you are already a fan of Death Metal . This Link is to the song Annihilation itself https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ7XLcagmmU

The record ""Black Seeds of Vengeance"" is a Grand-Scale , Cinematic Classic as well ! 

Listen to Nile ; - )"
"Recommend me some metal","I do love me some Nile! Cast Down the Heretic is my favorite song off of Annihilation. I really like the album Ithyphallic as well. Oh, and In Their Darkened Shrines."
"Recommend me some metal","Unmerciful's [Unmercifully Beaten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKgnka6MPg) is one of the sickest albums I've heard in a long time. [Deadlystrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWaeddjWoFE) is sick as fuck, blackened death brutality. [Short Bus Pile Up's ""Repulsive Display of Human Upholstery""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thsCsS3HnuA) was a sick album that I didn't take out of my car for 4 years til some asshat smashed it accidentally. I've got a ton of more suggestions, but I'm getting tired of typing and not slamming around my house."
"Recommend me some metal","I really liked Unmerciful. I'll have to listen to more by them. Deadlystrain is also pretty good. I couldn't get into Short Bus Pile Up. That tin can snare sound just runined it for me. Otherwise they were pretty good.



Thanks for the recommendations!"
"Recommend me some metal","Yeah those piccolo snares take some getting used to on SBPU. If you're into Beheaded you might also really like Abysmal Torment (they're also from Malta). They're older stuff is a lot heavier, but everything on Omega is still pretty good even if it sounds a little chingy."
"Recommend me some metal","Abysmal Torment is a bit too Grind for me. Thanks for the recommendation though."
"Recommend me some metal","Katalepsy - Autopsychosis

favorite recent slam album "
"Recommend me some metal","I really like this. Going to have to hear more. Thanks!"
"Recommend me some metal","Aeon, deeds of flesh, massacre, DEATH, morta skuld, obscura, arkaik, mortal decay and exhumed are all awesome!"
"Recommend me some metal","Exhumed rock my face off."
"Recommend me some metal","I've seen them a few times now and they kill it every damn time. Such a badass band."
"Recommend me some metal","Check out [Pessimist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntaM3xmiE6k), they're awesome. "
"Recommend me some metal","Not bad. They sound a bit like Deicide to me. I'll have to listen to more. Thanks!"
"Recommend me some metal","I've heard them described as Cannibal Corpse meets Deicide. My favorites from them are their first two albums, 'Blood for the Gods' and 'Cult of the Initiated'. Haven't listened much to their newer album though."
"Recommend me some metal","A few bands you may like with a song to start with:

Cryptopsy, [Benedictine Convulsions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvoZBB79h58)

Wretched, [Morsel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c9Gm1H1j8) (very cannibal corpse like)

Decapitated, [Day 69](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEXsTVr2ez4)

Cattle Decapitation, [Your Disposal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szOlMfoN-jU)

Krisiun, [Cursed Scrolls](http://youtu.be/bhYgJgdxdkM?t=16m23s)

Devourment, [Festering Vomitous Mass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycHWQQEIKDs)

Vital Remains, [Dechristianize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqsd5Z8-czg)

Shit, there are so so many to go by, but these and what the others have suggested should make for a good start.
"
"Recommend me some metal","I like some Cryptopsy but not much. 



Wretched is fantastic! I can't believe I have never heard of them before.



I have heard of Decapitated but have never really listend to them. I will now. Same with Cattle Decapitation.



Krisiun is hit or miss for me. I like some of their songs but the majority of their work I dislike.



Devourment is a bit too grind for me.



Vital Remains. Holy shit. How have I never listened the them before? They have gained a new fan this day.



Thanks for the recommendations!"
"Recommend me some metal","No worries mate, glad to be of help!"
"Recommend me some metal","Why did you not list Butchered at Birth?  "
"Recommend me some metal","I'm not really into that album. Or Tomb of the Mutilated for that matter. I only like maybe 1 or 2 songs on them."
"Recommend me some metal","Seriously, that's my favorite CC album."
"Recommend me some metal","Variety is the spice of life....

For me it's Cannibal Corpse's Tomb of the Mutilated. I cannot for the life of me enjoy that album. I could never get into this band anyway.
Another is Death's Leprosy. Such an underwhelming experience for me. 

Any of you guys have any?
"
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Necrophagist - Anything.

That strain of tech death I will never get into. I feel it's: Ew, wank-wank, riffs with the same structure, arpeggio-overkill, terrible vocals, no atmosphere and a flat and uninteresting sound. 

Another thing that annoys me is the fans just scream ""GREAT MUSICIANSHIP! CAN'T YOU HEAR THE GREAT MUSICIANSHIP!?"" whenever the band is discussed. It's really not my thing."
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","You know who else is a really good musician? Kenny G.

I hate most tech death. "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","A lot of it isn't great and most is very uninspired.

But there are a lot of original and great bands in that genre imo! "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","I think possesed's seven churches was over rated there i said it . runs away"
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","I actually agree with you there. I don't deny it's importance, I just never personally got into it."
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Anything by death-vocals-era-Opeth. They've always sounded incredibly boring to me- no heaviness, no emotion, no death metal other than in the vocals. "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","cannible corpse ( any ) "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","I don't think CC did anything another band didn't do (or had already done) better. 

Source: Morpheus Descends ""Ritual of Infinity"", Suffocation ""Human Waste"", Repulsion ""Horrified"""
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","I absolutely love Torture and am fairly ambivalent about the rest of their discography. "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Back in the day I really enjoyed the first 3 albums. Nowadays I really can't listen to Chris Barne's vocals anymore. In the meanwhile I think they're just horrible (see what SFU has done to me) and instead I prefer the newer Cannibal Corpse albums, even though I usually don't listen to technical DM a lot."
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Kill yourself.  The band has changed everything but the bass and drum playing musicians, their sound has morphed considerably over time. 

I'm pretty much a Barnes era CC fan.  Though the song [Blood Drentched Execution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvS0TEPRCNw) is an amazing display of Fisher's vocal ability."

"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Try as I may, I never got into Krisiun, Nile, or Suffocation, all of which had phases where they were pretty widely worshiped.  Likewise, contrary to the apparent widespread worship they get here on reddit, I have nothing good to say about Behemoth.  I don't understand the adoration, but as the cliché goes, to each their own."
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","I think some of this is all about the right time, at the right age. 
I like some of Cannibal Corpse's stuff.. But if someone told me today to go and check them out, I'm pretty sure I wouldnt like it at all. Listening to death metal for more than a few minutes now (some exceptions of course) is unbearable.. 

I never fully understood the majesty of Morbid Angel, to be honest. And since I'm too bored of death metal (some exceptions of course) I'll never will, I guess. No specific album."
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Glad I'm not the only one. DM is my first love but there are very few bands that do it for me any more. The truth is, if I want to listen to something brutal nowadays I just turn on the news."

Suffocation (everything after Effigy of the forgotten)

"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","All melodic death ranging from Carcass' forays into it to the ""not really related to death metal in any way modern melodeath?"" "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Yup. "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Brutal. Ever listened to Exmortus? Their more recent stuff is tech death/thrash leaning much heavier on the thrash side, but their earlier stuff was tech thrash/melodic death and is basically completely unrelated to any melodic death sound outside of them that I've ever heard. I'm convinced that if they were tuned a step down they'd be considered straight tech death/thrash. "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","The problem here is that I'm not super fond of thrash either. Listening to Immortality Made Flesh. This legit sounds like Children of Bodom. That is, it sounds like edgier power metal.

Listening to War Gods, way better but still not really up my alley.

To be fair though the sort of death metal I dig is stuff like Antediluvian, Mitochondrion, Portal, Pseudogod, Suffocation, Immolation, Incantation, Dead Congregation, etc, etc, and none of that's particularly melodic at all. I love dissonance and ugliness."
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","As a CoB hater, I take offense at that!

In all seriousness, you know, fair enough. I listen to a bit of everything death metal (except most modern melodic death- I hate that)- I listen to everything from progressive melodic death like Persefone to OSDM to straight death to brutal death to whatever, etc etc, and while I highly dislike most straight thrash, I'm a really big fan of death/thrash (well, all mixed thrash) in general. Stuff like Exmortus (or Vader, Possessed, Hellwitch, etc) just tickles me. "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Vader can be fun, Possessed is good, etc. I'm really more of a black/doom guy. Indian's From All Purity is my favorite album of this year by a landslide. As far as death metal, nothing's topped Pyrrhon's The Mother of Virtue."
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Fair enough. My listening is mostly death metal but overall I'm kind of all over the place- my top artists on Last FM are a black/thrash band, a prog metal/rock thing, Fleshgod Apocalypse, some classic heavy, Nile, Dying Fetus, some power metal, and then Strapping Young Lad. 
Lately, I've been listening to a TON of Cormorant (progressive black metal that's pretty folky), and I've hit their newest 2014 release (Earth Diver) several times in the last couple of days. It's pretty good, I recommend. 

I haven't checked out Pyrrhon. I'll have to see what they're about tomorrow when I have the time. As far as my top albums, well, my listening tastes are broad enough that I have a hard time choosing- if my mood is very Triptkyon my favorite release is going to be very, very different than if I want Dead Congregation or Origin. "

"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Agreed. I enjoy Death but they get waaaay too much credit as innovators. "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","&gt;Agreed. I enjoy Death but they get waaaay too much credit as innovators.

They had an early death/thrash demo in 1984, though...say that they're overrated musically all you want, they had some of the earliest death metal sounds out in the early/mid 80's."
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Hellhammer, Bathory, Slayer, Sodom, Kreator, Repulsion, Death Strike, Possesed, Morbid Angel, Slaughter,  Necrovore and Sepultura all had released or were releasing material around the same time frame. 

I didn't say Death weren't AMONG the first, but they were hardly alone, and I think a lot of people forget the contributions of the above bands. Slayer, for example,  was releasing fully-formed death metal in 1984 with Haunting the Chapel, and anyone who wants to cry ""but that's thrash!"" needs to listen to it again and remember that guttural vocals are just one part of what defines the genre. "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Hellhammer, Bathory, and Sodom were the first wave of a different type of extreme metal that certainly influenced the death metal to come but can hardly be counted as part of it. Slayer and Kreator may have been more aggressive thrash, but even though you say preemptively counter by calling them death (with Slayer), well, I disagree. Aggressive thrash may have turned into death metal but death metal they weren't. 

Morbid Angel, Necrovore, Repulsion, Death Strike, and Sepultura came after Death By Metal. Some of those bands formed the same year, even, that Death By Metal came out. Possessed's Death Metal demo was the same year as Death By Metal.

To say that Death By Metal was anything but one of the very first releases approaching genuine death metal is unfair to Death. Even if you don't like them or think they were influential towards the beginning, you can't deny that they had a death/thrash demo early enough that they have to be given SOME credit. "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","I think you're thinking I disagree with you more than I do. I DO like Death and I DO think they were influential, and among the first. My issue is that people point to Death as the sole innovator, which is doubtful. 

By 1986 all of those bands had released music in some format. Surely you can agree that full length albums with label support from Possesed, Kreator and Slayer  were influencing the scene as a whole by 1985, to an extent that at least competed with a demo tape from an unsigned Florida band? You even refer to the Mantas demo as ""death/thrash"", a label which could fit almost any of the proto-death acts I listed. 

As for Hellhammer et al, yes, the ultimate extension of those bands is black metal, but at the time the terms death and black metal did not exist in the way they do now. Those genres developed nearly simultaneously and have many shared influences. 

My point: Death were not alone. They are an important piece of the puzzle, but the origins of death metal are a wave of bands from 1983-1986, all innovating techniques, styles, aesthetics, etc and influencing each other (Chuck and the Repulsion guys tried to merge into a Death line up at one point, for instance). You can't point to ONE band as inventing death metal, it isn't that simple. "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","&gt;I think you're thinking I disagree with you more than I do. I DO like Death and I DO think they were influential, and among the first. My issue is that people point to Death as the sole innovator, which is doubtful.

Oopsies. Fair enough, mate. You're completely right, and I agree with basically all of your points- hell, didn't everyone else steal Slayer's drumming from Reign In Blood? They have probably as much, if not more,  influence on death metal than Death themselves between that, their popularity, and their extremity in the thrash scene. 

I have a bad tendency to get overly defensive every time someone says something like ""Slayer invented death metal"" (because they didn't) or if I interpret them to be dissing Death or Possessed or whoever. "
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","just symbolic? not individual thought patterns or human?"

"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Anything by Suffocation. I just don't like them. The music feels too slow to me."
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","They're Tech Death.

I don't like Tech Death there's no groove.  It's bit after bit of mega talent but it doesn't make my head want to concus itself."
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","If you miss groove in tech death you should check out Iniquity! Lots of slow grooves, broken up, picked up again, lots of variation and cool breaks!

I personally love the album ""Five Across the Eyes"".

Here's the song [Inhale the Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0JX4SRKy5c)"
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","Anything by Dismember. Just don't get it. It feels like heavy rock or some sort of punk/thrash hybrid to me. Maybe I haven't heard the right albums."
"What highly praised death metal album could you never get into?","I recommend the self-titled ""Dismember"" album. If you are not blown away by ""Black sun"" then I don't know what else will do the job :) 

But my all time favourite is definitely ""Indecent &amp; Obscene"". I don't hear any Heavy Rock on this one! Massive Killing capacity probably can be classified like that, but all other albums not so much."

"Why does anyone listen to the band they like?","...is it based on how the vocalist sounds, or how the guitarist(s) plays, or the pace of the drummer."
"Why does anyone listen to the band they like?","I like bands that are a perfect combination of all of those things, that appeal to my taste in music (whatever the genre is).

For this genre I like fast drums double kicking my face.  Guitars tuned down low, solos aren't important to me.  Guttural vocals.  Relentlessness is also lovely.

Vital Remains - Icons of Evil.

Deicide - Til Death Do Us Part

Cannibal Corpse - Butchered at Birth


that kind of thing
"
"Why does anyone listen to the band they like?","Edit: I really don't know where I was going with this. This is why I should avoid reddit when I'm really tired; I tend to make a tragic ass of myself. I guess i interpreted the question as asking what we like about this music and what distinguishes artists from one another when to most people it all sounds like the same old noise and screaming. But that's not the case, so... Take it away, past me.

I take it you aren't a Death Metal person and it all sounds the same to you. 

Yeah, it can be how the singer sings, the guitarist plays, having a sick drummer. It can be catchy lyrics or badass riffs or pretty interludes. It can be anything that makes them sound unique that appeals to the listener. Because it's music. Weird, extreme, violent, abrasive music, yes, but it's music. So all the same reasons people like music in other genres could apply. 

I like the growl Chris Barnes had on the early Cannibal Corpse albums and I like them partly because of that, but that's not a Death Metal specific thing. I also like Elton John because of how he sings. I like the riffs and the way Jimmy Page plays in Led Zeppelin. But I also like the way John Gallagher plays in Dying Fetus. Buddy Rich was a super talented Swing drummer and I like listening to his speed and prowess, much the same way I do George Kollias from Nile.

Now, there's stuff in the genre of Death Metal as a whole that draw people to it and could be generally described as the hallmarks of a good Death Metal band. First and foremost, I think, is heaviness. Its such a hard concept to describe- the impact, the almost physical moving force of the music. Another is the dark atmosphere: minor tonalities, foreboding or aggressive sounding melodies. Technicality- a big draw can definitely be just basking in awe of the prowess of the musicians, be it apparent in the form of great songwriting, raw speed, or what have you. 

It's a very open genre in a lot of ways, though, so it's hard to come up with too comprehensive a list of qualities that define a good Death Metal band without excluding bands, albums, and songs that are very much still Death Metal. You could argue it's fast, but then what about Suffocation? The Cannibal Corpse song Festering in the Crypt? You could argue that it should always have harsh vocals, but what about Augury or Obscura, who frequently use clean singing?

TL;DR: Things that make a musical artist that someone likes aren't necessarily unique to Death Metal, although the Genre has some broader defining qualities that make a band a good Death Metal band in most people's eyes. Also I misunderstood the question.

"Why does anyone listen to the band they like?","Sorry then  I guess I misunderstood the question. Whoops."
"Why does anyone listen to the band they like?","what i meant was what makes you like a certain band. for me its vocalist"
"Why does anyone listen to the band they like?","Dying Fetus - Fast pace drums, creativity, grotesque vocals, shredding guitar, and agression, point of views in lyrics"
"Why does anyone listen to the band they like?","I guess I'm pretty old-fashioned in my taste. When listening to a new band and the singer sounds like a squashed frog then I'd immediately stop listening. Among my favourite vocals are those from Jörgen Sandström/Grave, Matti Kärki/Dismember or Chris Reifert/Autopsy so go figure.

I prefer guitars rather be not too technical, but still very fast. Typical Thrash/Death riffs with fast pickings and schredding. Drums are fine with blast beasts (as long as they're not sounding like a sewing machine) but I'm also perfectly fine with just fast Thrash drumming. Such dead simple drums like on Death ""Leprosy"" album are gold, I'm not looking for all the crazy drum fills and what not.

For me the production is important too. I'm not too keen on clean and polished recordings, but rather enjoy the rawer kind of things. When there are real drums on a recording, I'd like them to sound like real drums too. There's no point in triggering ALL THE THINGS because then you could just fire the drummer and use programmed drums instead."
"Why does anyone listen to the band they like?","How the Drums mix with the Guitar. Good vocals are a bonus. Only certain songs stick on certain bands."

"Production quality is ruining older bands for me","I love watching older deathmetal bands live. But when i listen to the actual albums, i have to turn it off. The quality ruins it. Is this common, and is there a way to work around this? =(


Edit: I should mention that I listen to older metal that has good production quality. Heartwork - Carcass, Death - The Sound of Perseverance, Entombede - clandestine, etc. They all have quality production. I love them. I just don't like the dirty sound where I can't hear any distinct sounds."
"Production quality is ruining older bands for me","This happened to me with black metal, but then I kind of ""forced"" myself to listen until it didn't bother me anymore. You'll get over it, eventually."
"Production quality is ruining older bands for me","+1 for this, its just a matter of getting used to and sometimes when you are used to older production you just cant listen to the modern one because it lacks the soul"
"Production quality is ruining older bands for me","You nailed it on the point too, I mean with newer bands I expect a lot more quality wise. But when it comes to older stuff quality doesn't really matter. And that's pretty much the whole reason people can't get into BM or OSDM, because once people hear the production quality they automatically get turned off. Not all music has to be good or bad just because of its production quality. And IMO, if you can listen past that and still like that person/band you get respect."

"Production quality is ruining older bands for me","So you would prefer say ""Leprosy"" from Death, to ""Winds of Creation"" from Decapitated? Production at least?"
"Production quality is ruining older bands for me","Yeah I'd prefer Leprosy, and I'd definitely prefer Winds of Creation to the other Decapitated albums."
"Production quality is ruining older bands for me","I agree with you."
"Production quality is ruining older bands for me","Which death metal bands have you been listening to, and what about their production quality is putting you off?"
"Production quality is ruining older bands for me","Obscura - gorguts is a good example, And it's just the sounds. It's not clean, it sounds dirty. Like the drums sounds washed out and muddy and the guitars don't sound good to my ears. Idk."

Just listen to it more, you won't care eventually."
"Production quality is ruining older bands for me","then turn it up louder ya pansy"
"Production quality is ruining older bands for me","No, I feel you on this one. I ~~was~~ never really knew of Gorguts until I listened to Colored Sands just recently and grew really fond of them. 

I decided to check back some of their earlier albums and they lacked the clarity and power that Colored Sands had. Was very disappointing. Great music, well written songs, bad production quality.

"New to death metal","Keep on keeping on with Death. That's been my favorite metal band for like 3 years now. I genuinely like every song they've ever put out. Other than that, early Suffocation. Also Morbid Angel is a must. Pestilence. Deicide. Necrophagist. Dying Fetus.  

Kinda wanna be more specific actually. My favorite albums:  Suffocation: Effigy. Also pierced from within. Morbid angel: Covenant. And altars of madness. Pestilence: consuming impulse. And testimony of the ancients. Mostly consuming though. Deicide: self titled. Necrophagist: both albums are amazing. Dying fetus: reign supreme.   "
"New to death metal","The first album to really get me into death metal was Morbid Angel - Gateways to Annihilation, but really any of their earlier work is great as well. Also, Dying Fetus - Destroy the Opposition is another personal favorite. "
"New to death metal","Help to self help: 

Go [here](http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Goat_Zombie/top_250_death_metal_albums_of_all_time/) and go through the albums one by one via youtube. Soon you'll begin to understand which types of metal you are into, and once you find something you think sounds interesting, simply use YouTubes related links to click further into the (somewhat) same genre. 

I have been listening to metal for a long time, and I still do this on occasion. YouTube has become my best ally in exploring new bands. Even the cancerous comments will sometimes hold recommendations to similar bands. 

It takes time figuring what you like, so be patient, and keep listening. Ask yourself what you like about Death, and what you don't like about other things. If you, as you said, just started out with death metal, venturing into too many genres simultaneously can seem confusing. It takes time to get into new genres, in a very literal way.

P.s. Death is such a good place to start, so you are well on your journey already."
"New to death metal","Just listened to all of those bands. I guess it's just me but I don't really like them that much. I guess Death is really the only death metal band I like. Thanks anyways!"
"New to death metal","There is a lot more to death metal than what they suggested. There are several bands similar to death and sub grenades of death metal that don't even sound like death. I enjoyed death for a long time before finding other death metal I enjoyed. "
"New to death metal","Sub grenades"
"New to death metal","Try Cannibal Corpse, Phycroptic, immolation, Amon Amarth, Dethklok, Sinister, Suffocation, those are some of my favorites that I can think of, and also If you like high and low vocals, The Black Dahlia Murder is one of my favorites. their song On Stirring Seas of Salted Blood is badass. 
I hope you find more death metal that you like man, It's an amazing genre that hopefully never dies!

"New to death metal","Suffocation is good. Listen to these albums by them Pinnacle of Bedlam Pierced from Within Blood Oath and self titled Suffocation. Bolt Thrower is good. All there lyrics are about war. Entombed is good. Left Hand Path is really good by Entombed. Nile is respected but I am not a big fan of Nile. Amon Amarth is good but there more melodic death or folk metal. Check out the youtube Infidelamsterdam. Hes a legend. He works with small time Death Metal Artist and big ones to. Hes really cool and his videos are awesome. He will show quite a few death metal artists. He will also show other things. Also Count Blagoroth is good. Last Fm is a good site to find new bands of any genre. Spotify is good for exploring music.  Be open. A lot of death metal is pure shit. You have to dig a little to find the good stuff.

[Abysmal Dawn - From Ashes](http://youtube.com/watch?v=yMPxwIAIHWI) - a local band from the Los Angeles area with a darkened sound. Nothing really stands out about them but this album just has an intangibable touch.


[Azarath - Diabolic Impious Evil](http://youtube.com/watch?v=ksflUG98N-o) - I swear by this band and this album. Azarth shares a drummer with Behemoth (Inferno) which is how I learned of them. The lyrics are cheesy but I think the music speaks for itself. I look at this band as a somewhat stripped down version of Behemoth, and I think they pull it off flawlessly.


[Dissincarnate -Dreams of A Carrion Kind](http://youtube.com/watch?v=ADoQyFyOtd4) - Dissincarnate has a kind of cult status about them. They released only one album (early to mid 90s I think)... and what a shame when you listen to it. I'd liken it to Incantation and the early 90s Death Metal sound. Something Dead Congregation makes me think of.

"Asian Death Metal","Asian death metal is awesome. I'm an Australian playing in an otherwise all-Japanese brutal death band, Pukelization. I've linked our soundcloud. I'm gonna offer my opinion on the scenes I'm aware of in Asia and suggest some bands. 

Indonesia in particular is undoubtedly the hidden metal capital of the world. Strangely, brutal death metal has almost been absorbed into the mainstream economy. Many government officials support brutal death metal events which have major sponsors such as Marlboro. Indonesian death metal fests must be among the biggest and most frequent. You can view high quality filmed events of local Indonesian death metal. Indonesian death metal scene is quite self sufficient due to its size, many bands dont need to travel internationally. In the streets you can identify many metal fans. I would suggest listening to Asphyxiate and Demigod from Indonesia.

Philippines has a flourishing metal scene. Metal is much more underground here, but is getting healthier due to the hard work of local promoters like 'Insane Bazooka' putting on shows and drawing Asian internationals. Philippines have a wide range of metal but seem to favour brutal slam. Philippines has a great hardcore &amp; punk scene as well. I once attended a show in the south and a government official was in attendance, when police came to shit it down, he allowed the show to go on. From Philippines check out Down from the Wound, Human Mastication, The Deadflesh Architect, Mass Hypnosia and more.

Vietnam has a young metal scene which is working very hard to grow and doing a great job. Vietnam seems to have a wide range of metal and metalcore. Vietnam metal shows tend to start early in the afternoon, as VN has strict laws about noise after 10pm. The scene is supported by blogs and social media promoters like Saigon Metal Group and Vietnam Hardcore. Metalcore seems to be the big one here but all metal can be found. Check out Brutore, Multiplex, Cruel Society, SagoMetal and more.

Taiwan I have been just one time but heres my impression. Seems like deathcore is really big in Taiwan. Entering the rehearsal studios of Taiwan I can see the posters and merchandise for many local deathcore bands on the walls. They also have some death metal. We were brought across by Revilement, awesome technical death metal band. Check out Revilement, Beyond Cure and SIDEEFFECT.

There are many metal scenes and bands in Asia, and these are just the ones I've been personally. There are also scenes in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and more. Although Ive been to Japan I feel like spotlighting some of the other scenes in this post. Anyway, happy headbanging, enjoy some Asian metal!

"Asian Death Metal","Japanese metal and punk have always been a huge interest of mine, though not for their slam/brutal death. Japan has a long, proud tradition of black, thrash, heavy, and death metal, as well as punk, hardcore, and crust."
"Asian Death Metal","One of my favourite Japanese bands is YBO2, I wish they had released more music."
"Asian Death Metal","I just checked a few of these bands out on last.fm - i'm not too into brutal death or deathcore stuff personally, do you happen to know any Asian bands doing a more old school DM or progressive death stuff for someone who's more into the Scandinavian DM style?"
"Asian Death Metal","Siksa Kubur (IndonesiA) are the first to come to mind when I think 'Progressive', although still brutal. I'm not aware of any bands in the traditional Scandinavian sound to be honest. Try Deathtopia (One-A Records, Japan). There is of course your big name bands like Cthonic (Taiwan). Give Mass Hypnosia (Philippines) a shot too. "

"Cryptopsy - Cold Hate, Warm Blood Imagine with Lord Worm on vocals...","Oh yeah, I did too at the Chicago house of blues. Got to shake his hand too.

I meant studio recorded.
Although he is credited with back up vocals"
"Cryptopsy - Cold Hate, Warm Blood Imagine with Lord Worm on vocals...","Lord worm sounds like a dying dog. Love the guy and seem him live tons of times but Mike has more technical talent."
"Cryptopsy - Cold Hate, Warm Blood Imagine with Lord Worm on vocals...","I've noticed that Cryptopsy's fanbase will destroy anyone who doesn't like Lord Worm. Being a fan of more modern death metal, I didn't discover Cryptopsy until their self-titled 2012 album. Fucking awesome album. Went back and listened to None So Vile...and I really hate it. 

Worm's vocals seem totally random, rarely on beat, and without finesse. I'm sure those are the reasons that some people dig it, but I like my death metal to be a little more refined. "
"Cryptopsy - Cold Hate, Warm Blood Imagine with Lord Worm on vocals...","Thank you. I have had Lord Worm personally feed me an earthworm during a performance and will always cherish that memory but like you said he is just not very refined."
"Cryptopsy - Cold Hate, Warm Blood Imagine with Lord Worm on vocals...","none so vile is my favorite album ever. i have a gig this halloween where i'm playing through it in its entirety with a bunch of local metal musicians.

but i get your opinion. it's kind of sloppy in a lot of parts....but thats what I love about it. It's like everything's just about to come apart but they keep it together just enough to keep it going like a chaotic whirl. "
"Cryptopsy - Cold Hate, Warm Blood Imagine with Lord Worm on vocals...","I feel that. Not my cup of tea, but I can see why people might like it.

Honestly, I'm just glad Cryptopsy has been able to be consistently good over the years despite line up changes...minus that one deathcore album that we do not speak of."

"Cryptopsy - Cold Hate, Warm Blood Imagine with Lord Worm on vocals...","Cryptopsy gets all of my upboats."
"Cryptopsy - Cold Hate, Warm Blood Imagine with Lord Worm on vocals...","I think Mike does this song better. His vocals are really suited to the more straight-ahead death metal style of Whisper Supremacy. "
"Cryptopsy - Cold Hate, Warm Blood Imagine with Lord Worm on vocals...","I'm certainly used to Mike but the song was written before Lord worm left the band so I still wonder what it would have sounded like.
The whole album actually.
Mike took a long time to get used to."

"I wrote/recorded this song. Its called ""Into Her Madness"" constructive criticism anyone?",""
"I wrote/recorded this song. Its called ""Into Her Madness"" constructive criticism anyone?","It sounds kinda over-worked for my tastes. If technical/ADD metal is what you're going for then great, but the track is lacking groove or a clear structure IMO.

That said, the songwriting and execution is really solid."
"I wrote/recorded this song. Its called ""Into Her Madness"" constructive criticism anyone?","I really enjoy fast metal :) and this track is super constant, you're right. But hey thanks for your kind words!

What bands do you love? I'm curious because most people think music isn't good if its not they're favorite genre (like technical metal)...but you still recognized my stuff as ""solid"" which is awesome :)"
"I wrote/recorded this song. Its called ""Into Her Madness"" constructive criticism anyone?","Oh it's a great track, I just like a little more groove with my technical metal (like Obscura or Cynic)."
"I wrote/recorded this song. Its called ""Into Her Madness"" constructive criticism anyone?","I love Cynic ! But yeah, I've been trying to find my own sound and everything is technical...so I guess I'm technical haha
Oh well. I really do love all kinds of metal though, one of my absolute favorites is Protest The Hero."
"I wrote/recorded this song. Its called ""Into Her Madness"" constructive criticism anyone?","really like this, the riffage is neat and its got a heavy sound. think the drums are too electronic for my tastes tho, the general production could be much more raw and organic in my opinion"
"I wrote/recorded this song. Its called ""Into Her Madness"" constructive criticism anyone?","It's pretty good overall, it would be nice to hear this with a more solid recording. Some of the slower more melodic parts around 1:23 could do with more low end to compliment the melody on top of it. 

Also if you were to do vocals with this I'd prefer to hear more a more harsh Grave style vocal track rather than something like Dying Fetus vocals(although that's just personal preference) also this could be a recording problem as opposed to the actual song itself but it could do with a bit more gain and crunch throughout.

Overall I must say I like it and would listen to it if it was fully fledged out, for a rough recording there is a lot of potential, also take some of what I say with a grain of salt, I'm very much a consumer of death metal rather than a producer ;)"
"I wrote/recorded this song. Its called ""Into Her Madness"" constructive criticism anyone?","Thanks for your kind words! So far everyone's criticism has been about the same...they like the song but the mix is mediocre. I will have to work on that.
As for my tone, I have a fucking hard time trying to find the right one. In this [riff video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQE65Z1yJxo) people were complaining that there was too MUCH gain/treble. Gotta find the right balance.

I'm glad to hear that an avid death metal fan would listen to this if it were professionally produced. We will be there one day...you should subscribe/like/follow or whatever so you don't forget about us!! Thanks for listening."
"I wrote/recorded this song. Its called ""Into Her Madness"" constructive criticism anyone?","I like this video a lot more, the sound is more to my ears but the treble is probably a little too high, still some nice riffs and yeah I might subscribe, do ye guys have an album coming out and where are ye from?"

"Best produced Death Metal albums?","In your opinion, what are the best death metal albums with the perfect production? For me it's both both Necrophagist albums, Obscura's omnivium, and gorgut's colored sands"
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","Bloodbath's Nightmares Made Flesh. Near perfection in tone, balance, weight and clarity in my eyes!"
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","I also liked fathomless mastery. The albums before the two are too static-y, though I've only heard them online."
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","IMO Unblessing the Purity is better than both.  That EP doesn't have a single bad second.  Weak Aside and Mouth of Empty Praise are two of the very best tracks in their entire discography IMO."
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","That is the heaviest EP I've heard so far."
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","I do really like those songs, and the album even, I just wish the production/sound/musical aesthetic had been a little different."
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","Agreed! Fairly similar production on those two albums whereas their older stuff just doesn't compare

edit: grammar"
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","And I must assert that their Wacken Carnage live set is the best sounding death metal noise ever. The sound guy was a wizard."
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","Vital Remains - Icons of Evil

Deicide - Til Death Do Us Part / In The Minds Of Evil (Most of Deicide's albums suffer very poor production)

Cannibal Corpse - Butchered at Birth / The Bleeding

Behemoth - Evangelion

so much this."
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","Although it's a totally different sound and feel, I think The Satanist is Behemoth's best sounding album.  

Definitely agree on Septicflesh too.  I hadn't listened to them in a really long time and wasn't even aware they had new albums out after Communion until just about a week ago, and their new stuff totally blew me away, Titan in particular.  It's fresh and exciting IMO."

"Best produced Death Metal albums?","I love Mike's hair."
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","I really like the production on Decapitated's Winds of Creation. It has that raw sound while still being clear enough to hear every note of every instrument clearly. I really wish Organic Halucinosis had that same production because there is some incredible drumming on that album but the high end is really quiet and you can't hear the intricate cymbal work. If you compare Krimhs cover of Invisible Control to the album version it's like night and day. Other than that:

Death - Symbolic

Nile - Those Whom the Gods Detest 

Opeth - Pretty much all of theirs. I love how you can hear fingers moving along the guitar strings especially on Damnation (Even though that one isn't Death Metal)

Carcass: Necroticism (Some things should sound dirty)

Tried to add some that people hadn't mentioned though I agree with everything posted so far.

But Jason was a major songwriter in his days with DF so it's gonna happen"

Also, Beyond Creation's latest "
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","I can't stand Observants production. The kick sounds soo bad."
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","I've never understood why people consider sterile, clean production a plus in death metal.  (Ob)servant and Omnivium both sound like plastic studio shit with no bite or feeling."
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","I obviously don't feel that way about that album, but I do feel that way about other albums."
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","Then you should probably get your ears checked."
"Best produced Death Metal albums?","Suffocation's latest album sounds really good IMO. A bit on the digital side overall but so complementary to their sound. Spawn of Possession's ""Incurso,"" has maybe the best bass tone ever and all-around damn good production. Colored Sands took me a few listens to appreciate and is definitely up there. "

[Hate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMzxBLRy3w0) My personal favorite Blackened Death Metal Band.

[Dissection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORLcFRbjet4) Their older stuff sounds a lot more evil but the Satanic messages are a constant throughout the existence of Dissection.

[Watain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4GqLpI0KVc) A lot like Dissection in lyrical content but the sound should be what you're looking for.

Hope I could help you out a bit. I'm not too big on black metal. Be sure to check out Dissection's early stuff if you like Reinkaos.
"
"Bands that sound like?","Thanks! I really liked Hate and Dissection, well at least the stuff you linked to. And /r/blackmetal only gave me two comments haha, so you guys helped me more. 

"
"Bands that sound like?","So glad that I could help you out. Solarflesh isn't Hate's best album but all of their work is pretty solid. Everything on Reinkaos is like music to the soul for me. 

There's a death metal band that only slightly reminds me of these guys instrumentally. Not as aggressive, but you should check them out. Glad to assist you though. People have been shitting on Behemoth recently but I'm glad to see another fan out there still loving their music. 

Here's that band though: [Inferi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzO9-qXJrAk) "
"Bands that sound like?","Check out everything on Dark Descent. "
"Bands that sound like?","&gt; Dark Descent

By.....Who?
"
"Bands that sound like?","Dark Descent is a record label."
"Bands that sound like?","Ah okay. It would've been a bit helpful if you said that. Because there's like 2 bands named that, 3 record labels, a couple record shops, and some more. "
"Bands that sound like?","http://www.metal-archives.com/labels/Dark_Descent_Records/855 

Check out specifically:

Adversarial

Lucifyre

And off the label, off the top of my head:

Antediluvian

Mitochondrion

Portal (kinda)

Abyssal

"
"Bands that sound like?","Ah okay. Thanks for the suggestions! I'll be sure to look them up. "
"Bands that sound like?","Anaal Nathrakh has that going on, but even heavier. Blackened brutal death metal/blackened grindcore depending on who you ask.  You might also like Deathspell Omega, Cryptopsy, and
Vader.

[Vader: God is Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW26DRKP68c)"
"Bands that sound like?","Abyssal, Portal, Antediluvian, Azoic, Irkallian Oracle and Mitochondrion should all be in that area."
"Bands that sound like?","You should try listening to Panzerchrist. War themed blackened death metal. Their new stuff is different than their older stuff, since they got a new vocalist, but both are quite unique."
"Bands that sound like?","sounds like you enjoy big budget high production blackened death metal. theres about 1 million of those bands out there so throw a dart and take your pick."
"Bands that sound like?","I didn't necessary mean ""big budget high production"" I just want bands that have the same amount of black and death metal in one. "
"Bands that sound like?","Don't worry, he's just a ""Trve"" black metal head. Some poser ass who thinks being extreme is done by strictly following arbitrary guidelines about music."

"Recommended me something?","I really like cannibal corpse and dethklok, and necrophagist and rings of Saturn. 

But I'm trying to find something like cannibal corpse mostly."
"Recommended me something?","You might try some Suffocation. They've got some great shit. If you really wanna go crazy, you might try some brutal death, like Abominable Putridity or something. When I'm feeling Cannibal Corpsey but don't want to hear them again, that's what I do.  "
"Recommended me something?","Oh my god, you gotta listen to Bölzer. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXkP4WS8Y_Y 
Some real trippy death metal. 

Also, if you haven't heard Behemoth - The Satanist from this year you better go and listen to it. Cannibal Corpse gets so dull to listen to, the same over and over. "
"Recommended me something?","[Abysmal Dawn](http://youtu.be/wedhP9yTjdk), [Immolation](http://youtu.be/-6kCCQQPWXo), [Broken Hope](http://youtu.be/QOeDHTFLZc8), [Bloodbath](http://youtu.be/ULpCnVVPOlk), [Aeon](http://youtu.be/IZf_cLvZyys), [Decapitated](http://youtu.be/_2ct64YcEec), [Omnihility](http://youtu.be/wQO7XBX1nlc), [Vader](http://youtu.be/KITVOy-jUmc)"
"Recommended me something?","That immolation song is exactly what I was looking for. The riffs aren't super technical, and it fucking grooves . I love it."
"Recommended me something?","They actually toured with Cannibal Corpse for the Decibel tour last year. As you can imagine the show was amazing"
"Recommended me something?","Fleshgod Apocalypse reminds me a bit of Dethklok and is nearly as technical as Necrophagist. Definitely give them a listen and Beyond Creation. "
"Recommended me something?","Try Wretched - Cannibal. Great band and album, fits somewhat close to what you're describing. Hope you enjoy!"
"Recommended me something?","Suffocation are the masters of the style Cannibal is famous for. Pure percussive brutality. 

Immolation for more cryptic, memetic riffing and structure. 

Incantation for doom laden, oppressive occult metal. 

Bolt Thrower for grinding, pummeling, war themed death. 

The first three or four albums by all of these are essential.
"
"Recommended me something?","I'm gonna try out suffocation. Since its been brought up like 3 Times."
"Recommended me something?","I'd recommend starting with the album Pierced from Within. Effigy of the Forgotten is in many ways a superior record, but the production is a little flatter and if you're fairly new to death metal (which it sounds like you are) Pierced will be easier to get into. "

EDIT: Fuck I have class on the same day as Amon Amarth's tour until 6:50 PM....looks like it's time to drop English....."
"Recommended me something?","Carcass man, carcass all the way"
"Recommended me something?","Cannabis Corpse. It's a parody band of Cannibal Corpse that focuses on weed and metal cliches- so, like a heavier, more pot-focused Dethklok. Absolutely fantastic death metal- I highly recommend. "
"Recommended me something?","Hahaha I knew someone was gonna recommend them. They are pretty awesome they just dropped a album not too long ago"
"Recommended me something?","I'm just surprised that nobody else did. I mean, a whole day and 18 other comments and it's on ME to recommend them? "

"Behemoth and Cannibal Corpse in Boston 2/27/15?","Behemoth put on one of the best shows i think i've ever seen. Granted, Cannibal Corpse had a short set (or at least it seemed like it), but Behemoth blew them out of the water. "
"Behemoth and Cannibal Corpse in Boston 2/27/15?","Just saw them in Philly last night, yeah Corpse's set was pretty short. Behemoth were legends as usual, I liked their stage setup.

Aeon killed, their drummer is not of this world. Can't stand their cheesy lyrics though."
"Behemoth and Cannibal Corpse in Boston 2/27/15?","I was there too. I only stayed for CC's first two songs. Their sets aren't that exciting anymore. Same songs and you get Corpsegrinder comedy hour. Behemoth definitely killed it. I went ape shit when the intro to Slaves Shall Serve started up."
"Behemoth and Cannibal Corpse in Boston 2/27/15?","Haha yeah, George wouldn't shut up about the horse-head guy. The first couple songs were pretty shaky across the board but they locked everything in pretty well after that.

&gt;“We’re proud of all these different styled releases and we loved doing each and every one of them, but the objective was never to settle with a certain style, so our time has come to shift once more. It was already decided right after the last album that the next record would not become The Fathomless Mastery part two, but in certain aspects it would actually become its antithesis. So prepare for an ultimate blueprint of destructive, raw, heavy, organic, and sludgy death metal.”

I'm stoked."

"Do you have a Top 10 Album releases already?","I gave it a few spins already and it's a really solid album. I like it, but I can see where you're coming from. I had to listen to it a couple of times to appreciate it because, at the beginning, it just sounded like, well, a death metal album, and usually I like to keep listen some different elements to really grasp my attention, which is why my list is conformed by a lot of Blackened Death Metal."

I wanted to hear y'alls thoughts on this album if you've listened to it.

I honestly can't get enough of it. I'm not a huge of symphonic elements sneaking into my metal, but this album is one of few that I'm gladly to make an exception for. Also, I am blown away by the guitar proficiency in this. I don't know of too many metal bands with this same kind of ""epic"" style that remain so technical. Son of Aurelius is another band that also blends a similar brand of technicality and epicness together pretty flawlessly, but I can't get over how intricate this LP is. There are parts I've had to listen to over and over to discern what each guitarist is doing, conversely there are some tremolo parts that pair with drop tempo with the drums that sound like the earth is being torn in half. This is probably my favorite album this year."
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","/r/technicaldeathmetal has more of this.  "
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","Hey, this is random but do you maintain the rivers of gore tab site?"
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","Gotcha. Thanks for the heads up. I'll try my luck over there."
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","I haven't seen too much discussion of it going on in /r/technicaldeathmetal, which is a shame. It deserves its own thread because it's fucking awesome. 

I really dig how melodic it is while still retaining brutality. It's kind of rare to see that in up and coming bands these days. 

I also really dig how well they blend their symphonic / choir elements into their music because, imo, that can easily be overdone and kill the mood for me. 

All in all, fantastic album. Each track is unique, heavy as hell, and with gorgeous melodies. Solid 9/10 in my book. "
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","It was posted there pretty much the day it came out.  It's where I first heard of Inferi on their first album.  It's just kind of old news over there."
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","Totally agreed. It's such an awesome experience when you can listen to an album and know for a fact that a SHIT ton of time went into making it. I'm on the same page with the symphonic/choir elements. The latin choir in ""Destroyer"" really took me by surprise, pleasantly."
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","Fuck yea man. I discovered them a long ass time ago on MySpace. My mind was blown when this album released. It doesn't get old "
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","Me too! Bless Myspace. I was living in North Alabama at the time and was cruising for bands from the area (they're from Nashville) and I found Inferi. ""End of an Era"" is so fucking metal, too. "
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","I don't know if it's YouTube's compression, but the guitars sound so flat/without chunkiness. In solos *and* riffs.

EDIT: It's better in ""The Ophidian Form"", but still..."
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","It's just YouTube. I have the vinyl for this and it is gorgeously produced. CD sounds good as well, not overly loud and very dynamic."
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","Seconded. I was fortunate enough to snag one of the limited signed pressings and it does sound incredible. I fucking love that ""Vessels, beyond the reach of time..."" breakdown thing. It sounds so good on vinyl. Youtube or mp3 doesn't do that part's depth and dynamism justice.

Only thing that sucks about the limited pressing is that there are 4 fucking sides of music over 2 records, so each side only has like 2-3 songs on it. The regular pressing has a solid 30 mins of music on each side before it needs to be flipped, which I envy."
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","Im in the same boat as you but I don't mind that much. The vinyl should last forever, isn't it 200g?"
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","A vinyl of the gods. Yes, it's definitely a very substantial record, and I don't regret the decision to get the special edition at all, it's a beautiful record, both in content and aesthetics, but I love just being able to chill out and listen for a while before flipping. I really shouldn't bitch though. I just got Deflorate by TBDM on vinyl and the whole album all the way through is just over 30 mins, so even one of the two Inferi records is about the same length. It's pretty rare to find an hour long metal album that is full of great tracks.

As amazing as it is, I think my audio setup is holding the album's sound potential back. I'm using [this](http://www.amazon.com/Jensen-3-Speed-Stereo-Turntable-Silver/dp/B000UVKE2I/ref=sr_sp-atf_image_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407091004&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=record+player&amp;dpPl=1) hooked up to [this](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-HW-F450-Channel-280-Watt-Soundbar/dp/B00BLX9510/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409028995&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=samsung+wireless+sound+bar). 

What kind of setup are you using?"
"Has anyone else grooved Inferi's ""The Path of Apotheosis""? It's fucking awesome. (Some vid links inside)","It may be a little bit of both. Guitar work that's generally higher tuned or played in higher keys probably has a lower necessary threshold for chunky guitar tone. It was probably engineered with more mid and high end treble because that kind of tone better fits Inferi's style. Also, Youtube's compression is fucking awful, a lot of the time."

"Elemental Nightmares - V, by Kaos Vortex, Eternal Storm, Will of the Ancients, Stortregn","[Elemental Nightmares](http://www.elemental-nightmares.com), a vinyl project consisting of 28 exclusive tracks spread out over 7 10"" vinyl splits recently released the fifth split. This one features one of the bands that I do vocals for, ([Kaos Vortex](http://www.kaosvortex.com)). We'd love to hear what /r/deathmetal thinks about our track!

Our split also features some pretty damn good melodic death metal from Eternal Storm (ES). The other side of the split will probably appeal more to those into black metal. Will of the Ancients (CA) have a certain Enslaved-ish feel to them, and Stortregn (CH) play melodic black metal much in the vein of Dissection &amp; Watain.

"What type of death metal you like the most?","Technical, hands down."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","I always hated tech death but I can understand why people like it. I mostly like it simple and groovy. Guy before me commented that Dying Fetus is tech and if it is I gues I like some of it too because Reign Supreme is fucking awesome."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","I always considered dying fetus a technical band but I would not consider them tech death. They definately fall under the brutal death subgenre. "
"What type of death metal you like the most?","http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Dying_Fetus/45 Says here it's tech death but they have a bit of both."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","My nigga. Dying Fetus man, so fucking awesome "
"What type of death metal you like the most?","melodeath,  I find in most metal genres a tinge of melody really helps drive the emotion of the song (like Amon Amarth, the melodic side pushes the heroic invigorating).

Also blackened death and progressive wank metal"
"What type of death metal you like the most?","I like some melodeath like Amon Amarth, Insomnium, Illdisposed, In Flames, Soilwork and so on. Older melodeath is nice aswell."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","I want riffs.

I want a groove that makes me stop what I'm doing just to bang my head.

I want dynamics...and by dynamics, I do not mean a loud part, a quiet part, a loud part.  Actual dynamics.

I want musicianship.

I want guitar solos.

I want it recorded well enough that I can turn it all the way up."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","I'm in the same boat, and I'd add that if there are vocals, I'd like to be able to *barely* understand them, but understand them indeed -- and have the lyrics be truly brutal."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Bolt Thrower, the answer is always Bolt Thrower."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Pat O'Brien increases my heart rate to an almost dangerous level"
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Straight, brutal Death Metal. I like deep, guttural vocals most of all.

Never was able to care at all about Black Metal or it's derivatives."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","I don't like black at all but God Dethroned is good. Give them a listen."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Polish death metal - vox, lyrical approach, blazing sound
Decapitated
Vader
Hate
Behemoth"
"What type of death metal you like the most?","I was gonna say Krypts and Corpsessed. Ultra sludgy, gross, non-technical. 

I also like a lot of newer death that blends with Black metal. I guess some call it ""Atmospheric Death""? Examples would be the new Diocletian record, Zom, Pseudogod, Paroxsihzem, Ritual Necromancy, and Begrime Exemious."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","I would just call them black/death or war metal (at least Diocletian) but i guess that's just me, heh. Great bands nonetheless!  I'm gonna check out Paroxsihzem, cheers!"
"What type of death metal you like the most?","New Diocletian is moving away from war metal though. "
"What type of death metal you like the most?","I haven't really got my teeth into the new one yet! Sounds interesting! "
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Could just be that the production is much more clean, but it's a damn good record!! I had trouble with their other releases because they were so noisy, I couldn't hear the riffs. "
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Are you kidding? Doom Cult Is awesome! At least if you like Revenge, Genocide Shrine etc. I'll give it a spin thou!"
"What type of death metal you like the most?","There's something I haven't heard anything about. Not a big fan of black metal but I'll be sure to listen to some of those.

Edit: Listened to Paroxsihzem and Ritual Necromancy for a few seonds and it automatically reminded me of Portal. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olWih7eajpk"
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Those all lean towards death metal more than black. Check them out. Very similar to the stuff you like, probably all influenced by Asphyx, Incantation, Grave, etc.

Just checked out Desecresy. Extremely sick!!"
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Edited my last comment, give Portal a listen. "
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Oh yeah, totally! I know Portal, but not well. Probably should listen to them more, because they're probably the main influence for all my favorite bands, haha"
"What type of death metal you like the most?","all of them, I like them all equally"
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Technical and Melodic hands down are my favorite.   "
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Blackened death absolutely. All the rawness of black metal without the 20 minutes of ambient noise, Teitanblood's Anteinfierno is a great example. The Bolt Thrower sound I love too, that grinding doom. I've never really been into sludgy shit, but that's because it was mostly the drums that got me into death as opposed to the riffs."

"What type of death metal you like the most?","I love Skinless. If your into them check out Dehumanized.

Some others Mortal Decay, Internal Bleeding, Pyrexia, Malignancy, and of course Suffocation "
"What type of death metal you like the most?","On mobile and at work, but have you checked out War Master? If you're into Bolt Thrower worship then you'll love it. Great band from my area. "
"What type of death metal you like the most?","I did, it's awesome."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Try Resurgency - False Enlightenment album. "

"What type of death metal you like the most?","Occult. Antediluvian, Mitochondrian, Wrathprayer, Adversarial. "
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Anything that sounds so crappy you think it was recorded in someone's garage, and there's as much time devoted to horror movie samples as to music. That's the good shit right there."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","I like all of it, but recently been into the more tech. side of it, Ulcerate, Fallujah etc. Blast beats."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","It'd be a tie between Melodeath, Technical and Blackened"
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Raw, cavernous, heavy death metal, with heavy dollops of black metal for good measure. Antediluvian, Zom, Malthusian, etc. Heavy and obscure as you can fucking get."
"What type of death metal you like the most?","Melodeath is my favorite. Tech death is a close second. "

"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","In January I am taking my friend from school to his first show which is pig destroyer. I have been trying to get him into metal slowly by giving him some classics such as iron maiden's number of the beast and megadeth's rust in peace. My question is what got you into the heavier side of metal so I can ease him in slow to harsh vocals and thrashing instrumentals?"
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","Melodic Death Metal is probably the best entrance to Death Metal

or early Thrash metal (Slayer, Sodom, Kreator) and then then transition into early Death metal (Death, Massacre, Morbid Angel)"
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","I was thinking about giving him soundtrack to the apocalypse next but I didn't know if it was still too early for that"
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","this is what it was for me. Amon Amarth and COB meant I was already used to the harsh vocals, and once I followed the historical path of OSDM as it evolved from Thrash riffs (which I also liked), the music began to make sense and I was hooked."
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","Dethklok - hear me out, the cartoon is funny as shit and the soundtrack/band is amazing. If your friend likes comedy, then you might slyly get them into metal too. "
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","These are wise words."
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","I would completely agree. I've got many a friend into metal by way of Dethklok.  Its a great show,  good music and gives an idealistic perspective of the inner e'er workings of the mind of a metalheaf"
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","Dying Fetus and the faceless both got me into deathmetal. I recommend showing him Opeth though, they have both clean and death vocals. Show him ghost of perdition :) "
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","I didn't think about opeth and I have blackwater park! Thank you great recommendation."
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","Find a subgenre that your buddy likes (you'll probably have to start with some more watered-down/""gateway"" bands) then explore that sub together. Luckily you're going to a show and that's the best way to convert the innocent."
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","[deleted]"
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","I took 2 non-metalheads to see Arch Enemy recently, and they both had a great time.

That said, I absolutely love metal, have been to literally hundreds of shows, and I wouldn't go to Pig Destroyer.  I'd bet they'd just confirm everything your friend doesn't like about metal and turn them against it once and for all.  Start with a band that makes an effort to be enjoyable."
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","Aye, Pig Destroyer isn't exactly 'easing' them into metal."
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","Power metal is a gateway into metal. 
Early metallica is a gateway to thrash. 
Death is a gateway to well death. 
Dissection is a gateway to black.

Last but not least anal cunt is a gateway to grindcore, or permanent brain damage."
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","Well, I was 12 y.o. at that time and kinda wanted to listen something brutal and extreme.

Anyway, I've got my non-metal-head friends singing along to Cannibal Corpse's _Pounded into dust_. I think the key was that I presented it as something fun... when they were drunk. Also had a great success with Bloodbath's _Ways to the grave_.

"
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","Love the topic. Second Maiden and agree with classic thrash metal. On the growl vocals side of the question, I had success with a couple of friends using ""ugly"" vocals as gateway: Carcass and Obituary, then At the Gates. From there, Domination from Morbid Angel should tie things together. (If he has a melancholic side, I'd throw some Paradise Lost in the mix too -- Icon is kind of a balanced moment, keep going back in time for added weight. If it works, you can throw him Anathema's Serenades and the deed is done.)

You guys should also watch together some Sam Dunn docs like Global Metal and/or the Metal Evolution series — it's a way to expose him to lots of different stuff while getting a coherent background. 

Good luck!
"
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","Early Opeth for me, particularly morningrise."
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","You could try bands like The Sword and Electic Wizard, they worked for me to convert a friend, then slowly feed them riffs from death metal tracks, some septic flesh, sabaton whatever to get them into the harsher stuff.  Also a major point to make for me when getting someon hooked is to tell them to take the vocalist as another instrument, and not worry so much about the lyrics and the clarity, comparing it to a trumpet in jazz."
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","You're skipping a lot of steps.  Maybe reiterate to your friend that ""it is an art form.""  And that way it might be easier to see how people develop a taste for it.  I draw the parallel with scotch whiskey.  Many people who taste scotch for the first time might be disgusted by it, but they can appreciate that it is an art.  "
"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","All of the suggestions on here are already pretty extreme for a non fan.  I would recommend one band to ease him into things: Epica.

First, Simone is gorgeous so YouTube videos will have eye candy to keep his interest.

Second, they have many varied tracks so it isn't insane screaming all the time.

Third, Mark Jansen growls but not all the time.  Its a great way to get your feet wet because growling isn't something non fans like at all.

Fourth, if he starts to like Epica you can branch off with the Epica family tree.  Kind of like Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon to keep his emotional connection to the music.

Mark Jansen was in After Forever with Floor Jansen.  Floor had ReVamp and is in Nightwish.  But she dates the drummer of Sabaton.  

Sabaton is on tour with Amon Amarth.  Just following that tree gets you to the kings of Swedish Metal and a shit ton of great metal.

Then, Simone has a baby with Oliver from Kamelot who had Alisa White Gluz as a back up singer and she fronts Arch Enemy now.  Kamelot also had Eliz Ryd as a singer and she is from Amaranthe and they are from Gothenburg, Sweden.  

And now you can talk all about the Gothenburg Sound and introduce In Flames, Soilwork and Meshuggah.

And really, once you walk them all the way through to Amon Amarth, In Flames, Soilwork and Meshuggah they should be ready for anything Pig Destroyer will throw at them."

"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","Great topic, but Pig Destroyer is a bit intense for a noob. always start them off with the classics (Death, Vader, Morbid Angel) and then ease into more brutal stuff like Suffocation, Decide. Some people, myself included, aren't too big into the super brutal bands, but after developing the ear for the technical stuff at that point can at least appreciate it for what it is.  "

"Trying to get a non metal head into metal.","It's probably too late now, but I don't think a Pig Destroyer show is going to be at all representative of what metal shows are normally like. Neither the crowd nor the band will likely give off a particularly metal-esque vibe, and the music might sound pretty much like white noise to your friend. But you do you--it could be great.

In terms of getting someone into metal (death metal or otherwise), I think there are two important things--one, you can't force anyone to like it. Two, a friend will be interested in it if you are interested in it, i.e. being just so excited about metal that you've got to show your buddy is the only way. "

"Why do we like death metal","Because of the Fucking Energy and Power"
"Why do we like death metal","[deleted]"
"Why do we like death metal","I third this. The energy I get when I'm listening to some songs is just incredible. There are a couple of songs that ,no matter what I'm going through, they just give me so much energy and drive. And then there are some bands that show you that death metal doesn't have to be aggressive. Be'lakor is in my list of top five music groups/musicians of all time and not once have I heard someone say, ""Let's fuck shit up to this.""
"
"Why do we like death metal","I don't think I could have said it better"
"Why do we like death metal","&gt;Because of the Fucking Energy and Power

This and I also have used death metal as a positive tool throughout my life to let out aggression, and to let go of anger and hate. It's like the music rages for me, and I can air the ugly out."
"Why do we like death metal","[deleted]"
"Why do we like death metal","*implying you can understand the vocals*

if you can, the metal is not death enough."
"Why do we like death metal","Vocal intelligibility decreases with *brutality*, not death, silly! Why else would self-described Brutal Slam bands use so many more GODDAMN COCKAMAMIE MOTHERFUCKING PIG SQUEALS than everyone else?"
"Why do we like death metal","Can I use the phrase 'God damn cockamamie motherfucking pig squeals' casually, please? I was dying. Hahahah!"
"Why do we like death metal","Please do. It makes life better."
"Why do we like death metal","I would look silly wearing the shirts without listening to the bands, so I really have no choice."
"Why do we like death metal","It makes me feel powerful, intimidating, and in control. It feels like there is energy coursing through my body that drives me to do massive things. It doesn't allow for confusion or doubt, it is, it always will be, and it will not be reasoned with.

It is force in its purest form. Utter, waste-laying force."
"Why do we like death metal","Because it's a stress release. Metalheads are often super nice people, and I think that has to do with letting our aggression out through our music. "
"Why do we like death metal","***RIFFS, MOTHERFUCKER.***"
"Why do we like death metal","My dad is a metalhead, so to me heavy metal is normal. Over the years I just gradually progressed from Maiden and Ozzy to heavier bands. Mine is a very typical story"
"Why do we like death metal","i think death metal is actually really smart. certain concepts like alternate realties, sci--fi, misanthropy, outer space, animal rights,human despair are really interesting. and of course the empowerment. "
"Why do we like death metal","For me, as a tech death fan, I am VERY appreciative of the technicality, speed, composition, etc but just in general I love the aggression and energy of death metal. As a drummer, I cream my pants constantly over the drumming of a lot of my favourite bands, and as someone who tried to play guitar but failed miserably I listen to and marvel at the insanity I hear on the guitar. And the vocals, which I hated at first (it was the drumming that initially got me into the genre) now complete the picture and I would never want to substitute them for something else. 

From a psychological standpoint, it's probably the power as said many times over by others. "
"Why do we like death metal","Listening since 1997 I've come to find absolute beauty in the energy and heaviness. I liken it to classical music."
"Why do we like death metal","Because extreme metal is the soundtrack to western civilization rotting.

Only death is real. "
"Why do we like death metal","I always make a political analysis of the music I listen to before I decide if I like it."
"Why do we like death metal","Because it kicks the shit out of any other type of music"
"Why do we like death metal","Death metal is the musical equivalent of spicy food"

I've never experienced it and I'm beginning to suspect you're all a bunch of sissies!"
"Why do we like death metal","Hey guys, OP is a big fat lady HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
"Why do we like death metal","Because, heavy."
"Why do we like death metal","But why do we like such heavy music? "
"Why do we like death metal","I just dig it. I think we all have our own reasons for liking it.  Mine being, it's loud, brutal and it annoys the shit out of most people. "
"Why do we like death metal","I honestly don't think there's a good or satisfying answer for any single genre. Why does anyone like any genre of music? 

Music grows in you. You develop your taste based upon your surroundings; friends (near, far or in cyberspace), family, what's cool in school etc. etc. etc. Culture.

We took a liking to this sound when we first heard it and things took off! Heaviness, brutality, intensity, speed. I don't think I am an especially violent or brutal person and I can't seem to find any connections between a personality and the music they listen to."
"Why do we like death metal","I wonder why more people don't like it. Possibly a mixture of fascination with death, horror films and music. "
"Why do we like death metal","The most generic reason is simply because it sounds great.  Beyond that, I love the speed, heaviness, and aggression.  Growls, blast beats, and double bass make me happy and get the juices flowing.  The lyrics/topics of my favorite bands tend to address things that align with my interests and views on life (Heathenism, Vikings, Norse mythology, anti-religion, etc.).  I also think the musicians tend to be the cream of the crop and they write/perform things far more creative and complex than the mindless, simplistic garbage found in the mainstream."
"Why do we like death metal","I enjoy the atmosphere that the music provides in times of sadness, as well as any other times in my life. I enjoy the general community of intense energetic brotherhood I feel as well as actively participate in when I go to shows...which says something because I usually do not actively participate in many group activities where my enthusiasm is at least matched or welcomed universally...however, I notice that the solace that I find within this genre of music...often depresses me quite intensely, and I am unsure of how to make my preferred style of music not make me want to return to the void...to put it philosophically...I am stuck between the rock of reality...and a comforting, unforgiving, brutal, misanthropic, understanding, evil glorifying, 240+BPM, hardplace...if you get my drift."
"Why do we like death metal","Because its music with substance most popular music is a catchy beat and a single phrase but death metal includes multiple elements of music jacked up to 11 and put on hyperspeed. "
"Why do we like death metal","Probably for the same reason I enjoy J-pop and Brian McKnight."
"Why do we like death metal","I listen to Death Metal for the aggressiveness of the music and lyrics. I actually find it soothing. No other music can get me going, so to speak, like Death Metal can."
"Why do we like death metal","Because we are aware of the world we live in. To me, it is the sound of the planet traveling through infinite black space, and it is not a peaceful planet."
"Why do we like death metal","cuz it's fun"

"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","Not just a debate of who's the better singer but of what era of cannibal is better all around."
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","I prefer corpsegrinder vocals, but Barnes era cannibal corpse is better. That being said, kill is still my favourite album by them."
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","Vocally, Barnes, easily - but, I know people will probably accost me for this as they have before, but the Cannibal Corpse era with Fisher has produced my favourite albums/songs. I'm a sucker for technicality and lower tuned guitars - something the later albums definitely show no lack of."
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","What about Barnes vocals are better/do you like more? I don't have a problem with them, but it just seems like he has no power or clarity at all. Corpsegrinder is super clear and pretty damn powerful.

I still very much enjoy older Cannibal, just curious.

Also, dat Frantic Disembowelment technicality."
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","Maybe that's why I liked his vocals more. Unlike Corpsegrinder, he was dirtier, more raw, more traditional. I do like Corpsegrinder's as well, though, he definitely adds a lot of punch to the mix.

Hell yes Frantic is amazing, but the album Kill, overall, is swimming in technical groove."
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","Oh yeah. Kill is their masterpiece I think. Every song just beats the shit out of you it's amazing. One of my favorite moments is in Five Nails Through The Neck, at about 1:39 after the pause. That scream, it sounds almost like he's getting nails through HIS neck. It's agonized and everything, just awesome."
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","Oh fuck yeah, that's insane. Wished they played more of this album when I saw them last time. It's so hilarious watching Corpsegrinder with his massively oversized neck, would have been sick to see him pull that track off."
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","I want to see them so bad man. They're the last of my triumvirate of bands to see live. They do play Make Them Suffer a lot though don't they?"
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","They do, they've played it both times they've been here! I'm sure you'll get your chance, they're showing no signs of slowing down, bro."
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","As great as Corpsegrinder is, Chris Barnes will always be king for me."
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","if you want corpsegrinder vocals with barnes era instrumentation check out the band monstrosity. all of their work from formation through 1996 featured good ol fashioned DM with mister fisher."
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","Barnes by a landslide, with The Bleeding also being my favorite CC album without much competition whatsoever.  

I do ask that he leaves his shit-soaked dreadlocks and hobo skater apparel at the door before he accepts this award, though."
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","completely agree. The Bleeding was their best album imo. i think Corpsegrinder is entertaining but Barnes' tone was better suited to their sound. ive completely lost interest in CC aside from the occasional listen. they sound generic with corpsegrinder. for me, CC died when Barnes split. also six feet under is boring musically."
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","I take it you don't like six feet under then lol"
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","Hehe, well, actually, I didn't mind the first 3, but then just stopped paying attention."
"Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes","Barnes became a HUGE asshole around that time. Honestly, what I love about Barnes-era CC is the fact that he wrote his own lyrics. I heavily respect that about him. But Corpsegrinder is the more talented vocalist. I mean, put them next to each other, and George would entirely drown out Barnes without any effort. "

I'm typically a brutal death metal fan, but stuff like Belphegor's ""Stigma Diabolicum"" or Carpathian Forest's ""Start Up the Incinerator"" move me on an emotional and spiritual level I can't quite explain.

In that vein, I'm looking for more stuff like Septic Flesh's ""Mechanical Babylon"" intro that use very atmospheric tones of worship, almost, in their music.  Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpInrL7uQxM 
I like deeper vocals, and already have the vast majority of the basic bands I can think of (The Faceless, Septic Flesh, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Behemoth, Dimmu Borgir, Old Man's Child, one or two tracks of Rotting Christ, you get the picture) and I'm just looking for more atmospheric stuff that puts me in a place of what I can only describe as worship.

"Sumerian and Eastern Influences","Man you've gone places in this thread ;D I'm not quite sure I understand what you're looking for (and it seems neither you, but that's cool). The title mention sumerian and eastern, and then there's a lot of blackened death metal on your picks. I'm gonna throw some stuff around here, listen and see if something makes sense. 

I got an ""epic"" vibe from your examples. Take a listen to this Moonsorrow track -&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcKWlb1xiBA. If it clicks, you might wanna wander into pagan/viking metal, and go deeper on blackened death. 

You mentioned eastern influences. Orphaned Land mixes prog/death with Middle Eastern tones, it's impressive. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7i6UB5vGw 

On a similar note, but more brutal death vein, inimitable avant-metal forefathers Lykathea Aflame also dealt with eastern vibes. Elvenefris is an album that should never be missed. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBDTc8TA-_k

Also Morbid Angel has lots of things that could be considered ""worship"" and ""sumerian"" on their discography, but it's more as a the theme than on the music itself (except the odd instrumental interlude). I think the same could be said about Nile. Since you didn't mentioned either of them on the OP, you should make investigating those your priority. :)

"
"Sumerian and Eastern Influences","Thank you so much for your reply!  Up-arrows for you, bro!

Moonsorrow isn't bad at all-- I sort of liken them to a budget Amon Amarth (who have some stellar stuff, btw).  I've found Aeternam is a good bet, too.

Orphaned Land is a little too far on the ""prog"" side of things, not quite my cup of tea, but they've got a few with some really incredible instrumental work when I looked hard enough.  

I'm really, really impressed with Lykathea Aflame, man.  That's some real jammin' goodness!!!  The vocals are the kind of ""deep"" thing I can really dig all over.

All in all, you're a badass, and I sincerely appreciate the time you took to put this list together.  You're one cool dude!"
"Sumerian and Eastern Influences","Hey man, my pleasure, helping folks finding good music brighten my day!

That Lykathea Aflame album is ungodly and gonna spoil you, because there's nothing quite like it. Take your time with it, give it some full listens, research and read some stuff about it. It's an unique journey!

Some bands you could consider researching after this: Mithras, Immolation, Anata. Have fun!"
"Sumerian and Eastern Influences","This is not strictly ""Death Metal"" but will definitively have that ""Double Harmonic"" tone that you like.  
  
Furthermore it looks like you rather enjoy Black Metal.

Mildly amusing story time-
I was smoking a butt in front of some ratty club in Orlando in 2001, waiting for SFU to get on the stage. I heard someone vomiting  in the dumpster way next to the club but didn't think much of it as it was so fucking common for dumb college kids to over do it on a Saturday night downtown.

some dude comes out of the club saying ""Hey, Chris out here?"" The bouncer responds ""He's around the corner."" The dude goes around the corner, slings Drunky McDrunkerson over his shoulder and brings him back inside.

10 min later the sound check is winding down, guess who walks out on stage? Barfy Mcgee! I had no clue what Chris Barnes looked like and didn't make the connection when they were talking about him outside. It was a terrible show, no stage presence and he spit on the crowd about 15 times... 

Still one of the best nights of my life, proving my life is dumb."
"SOOOOO.... THIS exists. You'll understand.","I saw Six Feet Under with Cannabis Corpse not too long ago.  Just want to say he did good job then, and didn't spit on anyone.  He did smoke a joint though.  This man must have so much weed given to him everywhere he goes."

"Im looking for a specific type of deathmetal","It's all about making a long-term effort to get it. My dad raised me on metal with distorted vocals and we'd sit in the car on long road trips trying to figure out the lyrics to metal bands playing on the couple of Sirius Radio stations that used to exist (though IIRC there's only one now- I don't have it in my car, so I don't know for sure). I'm at the point where unless the lyrics are intentionally overly distorted I can almost always get them if I focus a bit, and less distorted stuff is just like listening to any clean singing.

Human Remains is pretty cool sounding- kind of a groovy OSDM vibe with a hint of grind influence on it? Too bad they didn't ever do a full-length. "

I mean all of them. I was really into this kind of music in most of my childhood and early adulthood but now I don't feel anything.

There were some black ones like naglfar but I was really into in death metal like vomitory, fleshcrawl, cryptopsy (old) and so on. The best part was when I first listen to NCC and got to know with grindcore and goregrind. But this time has ended. Whenever I am listening to this, it's just a noisy void. There aren't any good ideas. Whenever a new album come out I can name wich band has already tried similar riffs, tone etc. Kinda boring. 
Yesterday I gave it a try again and was on a concert but after one hour I gave up. I think I'll take a little break and will see it later.

"kinda boring","Yep, absolutely. Let your tastes wander for a while. Listen to a bunch of jazz, or classical, or electro-rock, or whatever you feel iike. Then one day, you might get the itch to listen to something **CRUSHING**. And if you do get that itch, then you can get right back into the heavy stuff. No need to force it. Happens to me at least every 18 months, it's like a sabbatical. Wander off, indulge other listening curiosities, cleanse the palate. Then one day get the urge to blast the filthiest grind-tech-death you have. "
"kinda boring","True!

It's like eating same food each day: it gets boring after some time even if it is good."
"kinda boring","I got into Adele and Kings of Leon for awhile last year because all my favourite metal bands grew stale. I listened to their entire discography too many times so I went off and listened to the complete opposite on the musical spectrum. But I just listened to a few albums that got me into metal and they sent chills up my spine. Feels so good."
"kinda boring","I'm much less enthusiastic about death metal than I used to be, but I still enjoy it once in a while.

Taking a long pause helps. Maybe as long as a month, or even a year.

Also you might discover something new in music you already listened if you, basically, look at it from another angle after a long pause."
"kinda boring","This was me.  I was mainly into death metal for so long and i kind of got bored with it. I started listening to more black metal, grind, hardcore punk, prog rock, noise,doom and other stuff. Then i got into electronic music( Zombi, Tangerine Dream, Majeure) stuff like that. While i still listened to metal all the time, i felt like it was refreshing to go back to death metal. Like another user commented, when you want something crushing, i would always go back to death metal. While i don't listed to it as much nowadays, i still enjoy the hell out of it. "
"kinda boring","Nope, this is why I listen to pretty much every genre of metal. Gotta mix it up."
"kinda boring","Yep I'm kinda going through the same thing right now. Too much of anything will get old pretty quick (or in 23yrs). I've been trying to find other music to dabble in but so far,it's not going so well. Yoshida bros and that ""nuclear"" song by the guy who's name I can't remember are all I have found so far. Pls send help"
"kinda boring","listen to Trenchrot and Obliteration

best two death metal albums of the past two years"
"kinda boring","The only death metal I stomach these days are stuff like Ulcerate and Pyrrhon, then bestial. "
"kinda boring","i feel this way for years. i only listen to underground death metal bands in my locale these days. no point paying attention to most magazine and big label metal"
"kinda boring","I know what you mean. After a while it all sounds like blasts and growls and whatnot. Anything will get tiring if thats all you listen to. I will never define myself as anything other than a metal head, but dammit do I enjoy everything Modest Mouse puts out. Dont let this music become stale,  listen to everything and appreciate music for music's sake. But remember,  if you need to feel like crushing skulls, there will always be Tomb of the Mutilated! "
"kinda boring","Same here. I'm going through a hip-hop phase right now.

That and turbtablism."
"kinda boring","Prior to this moment I think I had heard death metal described as pretty much everything else except ""kinda boring.""  But yes I actually had a rap phase for several years ( not proud of this but it happened) and I pursued it until I found ""the underground"" and then I definitely got that ""kinda boring"" feeling.  I sold it all and never went back.  Perhaps the rap thing for me was ""just an image"" as JewsusChrist says.  I had the total package complete with $5k car stereo.  Now I'm back to metal full time and if I'm not hearing it live it's being played on a Hyundai.  Good luck I'm sure the feeling will pass and you'll be back into music of some kind soon!"
"kinda boring","If the shit you used to listen to doesn't do it for you... you failed. You were looking for the image, not the music."
"kinda boring","Fuckin posers right?

I guarantee anybody who tells you that you have to ""stay tr00"" to any kind of metal, whether death, black or whatever is fairly young or just stupid. They are the ones in it for the image, as they try so hard to stick to it.

To OP:

Listen to new types of music, I do this all the time and find myself coming back to death metal when the time is right. It's healthy to go through phases. Sadly, we live in an age where a lot of ideas have been tried and tested and the old school stuff cannot be touched because there's only so much that can be done when you place boundaries around your sound. It's only natural to grow weary of these walls and notice similarities between bands. 

Switch it up and try different genres within metal. Even *gasp* try something completely new. Jazz is very similar to metal in many ways and hip-hop might do it for you too. The funny thing is, once you've taken a break, your love of death metal comes surging back to you when you least expect it to. "
"kinda boring","Thanks man! I agree with you indeed. I've been always opened to any kind of music. It depends on how much creativity the music has. So I don't think it's permanent."
"kinda boring","Or get drunk, that usually helps temporarily!"
"kinda boring","Pretty much what joeay said. Don't you worry none, you'll never really leave death metal fully. Try jazz (if you thought heavy metal was varied jazz is even more so). Also try not listening to anything for a couple of days, that also helps. You'll be blasting death metal at 11 again before you know it. "
"kinda boring","So if your tastes *ever* evolve, you're a fraud. Welp, that's in the top 3 stupidest things I've heard today."
"kinda boring","Its only 7am and I can say with confidence I won't hear anything as fucking ignorant. "

"What happened to Muhammed Suicmez?","Hi everyone,

as the title says, how can I (we?) know what happened to Muhammed Suicmez (from Necrophagist)? I mean, how can someone like him just disappear. With all the social networks that exist today, I find it hard to believe that there is not even one person that can say ""Oh, I have seen him in the supermarket"" or whatever.

"Do death metal fans actually listen to Cannibal Corpse?","Cannibal Corpse is one of my favourite bands. They consistently produce brutal, riffy, catchy, no-frills death metal. They don't reinvent the wheel, but they don't need to. If you go into a CC record expecting Artificial Brain, you're gonna be disappointed, sure. But after you've listened to band after band try and fail to be 'interesting' by shoehorning in influences that don't quite work or gimmicky instrumentation or whatever, it's nice to know that Cannibal Corpse will always be there putting out great (if not revolutionary) music."

"What happened to Opeth?","In comparison to this 10 years ago:

http://youtu.be/5I2nOgheppw


I understand the line up changes but on Watershed they had the same crew and it was awesome then.  The sound now is a bit thin and lacking the punch and intensity it had that made it tolerable to listen to the drawn out emo bits.  Fuck, Akerfeldt is only like 42...  I'm pretty sure Jens Kidman is around 45 and his vocals are still insane.  Smoking??  I also listened to the single from the upcoming record and wasn't really digging it... The Heritage album had some great moments so I accept the change in their writing but I'm thinking they're almost done...  Thoughts?"
"What happened to Opeth?","Dont forget. Meshuggah are alien mathematicians sent from the future, so im sure that helps Jens."
"What happened to Opeth?","Although I see where you're coming from, I doubt they will be over soon. I saw them not long ago and they kicked ass (without a single growl) which makes me think that maybe this was a bad day for them or something. 

Akerfeldt is a music nut as well as a great performer and I don't think he wants to stop- just move in *another* new direction. Keep in mind that Heritage/ Pale Communion (and possibly Damnation) aren't the first examples of a shift in the band's sound, compare ""Blackwater Park"" to ""My Arms, Your Hearse"" or ""Still Life"". Part of why I love this band is because they aren't afraid to mix things up and experiment."
"What happened to Opeth?","I don't understand all the complaining surrounding Opeth.  They've been together for almost 25 years.  If they kept making the same melodic death metal over and over again they would just suck now like In Flames.  Plus when you're in a band that big you don't have a lot of time for side projects, and playing the same shit forever sucks."
"What happened to Opeth?","It's not really a complaint, just a thread started to discuss what they've been up to and regarding their new material.  I still love the band but sometimes I'm wondering if a band goes thru so many line up changes and then changes their sound why don't they just move on to a whole different project?  Just like Mastodon, they are awesome, have tons of material but aren't really hitting it like they did back in the early 2000's..."
"What happened to Opeth?","I like how Cannibal Corpse does Pop and Dubstep now, they keep it fresh."
"What happened to Opeth?","He's doing it on purpose so people will stop bugging him about death vocals.  "
"What happened to Opeth?","I really think Mikey was just tired of doing death metal all around, so did another album with *gasp* no growls?!  There has been talk of them doing more death metal, but right now I think they're happy being a prog band. 

I dont like their newer stuff either. Im currently listening to Damnation,  this is my favorite of their slower material."
"What happened to Opeth?","Someone once told me to check out Opeth and I did and I didn't like their music.

and of course the rest of Cannibal's lengthy discography. ""Tomb of the Mutilated"" is a classic, genre-defining album. Other bands of note, not like Cannibal but may still fall into the Death Metal category (depending on who you ask, anyway) and are worthy of checking out to see where your interests expand:

"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","This is the list to start with, all classic bands that are the hallmarks of the genre."
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","This needs to be higher up. OP comes to /r/deathmetal saying she likes death metal, dude provides death metal. "
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","Yes, all of you did deliver and so NEATLY, too. Everything has bullet points and explanations and such.  Who knew metalheads were so organized?  

Now, I'm REALLY into death metal and you all are my pushers. :)"
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","What a list!  Brownie points for the lovely bullet points and intro.  I feel like there should be a whole university class just for this (and I want to teach it, someday).

So far, I'm loving Suffocation (the band, not the act...ha!...little metal joke there).

To answer your question: during a recent late-night Youtube binge (I like to call it my ""research"") I stumbled onto a youtube vid of Kill or Become with lyrics.  I decided to give it a shot since a few years ago I worked a metal show (bartender) and remember how interesting it was to me (I wasn't exactly entranced, but I wasn't repulsed, either). I don't recall if any of the bands were Cannibal Corpse or not (I remember the singer of one band had a really ornate and possibly animatronic monster mask), but a seed had been planted (or began festering, whatever you prefer).  So, long story short, I clicked, watched the lyrics and thought they were simple but really creative.  Plus, I love anything zombie-related so that also helped!!  

Also, I can honestly say that I giggled (yes, GIGGLED) at the ""FIRE UP THE CHAINSAW!"" verse.  "
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","This guy brought the goods here. I can't recommend Severed Savior enough. Incredible band, as well as Gorguts and Decrepit Birth. Suffocation is also one of the best live dm bands anyone can hope to see. I'd also like to say to give the new Disentomb album a listen. It's called ""Misery"" and it might be the best dm release this year so far at least for me.

A few other bands along these same lines that I may add would be Defeated Sanity, Spawn of Possession, Disgorge, Gorerotted, Arsis (A Celebration of Guilt), First Fragment, Wormed, and Augury, to name just a few.

For a list of bands featuring female members as well, give Abnormality and Cerebral Bore a try. For something a little more well known try out Arch Enemy when they still had Angela. Their not as heavy or technical as some of these other bands but they're a good start for someone with interest in the genre."
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","Here are a few of my favourite bands (might be less deathy than you're looking for, but hey ho!):

[Arch Enemy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InRMwptcgAo) is a good band with an excellent female singer (growler).

[Beyond Creation] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzAnRLfZOY) are one of my favourite bands, kind of technical but still with some awesome riffs and gorgeous growls.

[Bloodbath] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_dynl-vnzw) are a great death metal band, good growls, interesting lyrics.

[Fallujah] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WpQ8MlOoX0) are interesting, lots of different styles and 'movements' within their tracks, with heavy bits and more melodic parts.

[Vale of Pnath] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1V__kzkIdw) are growing on me each time I listen to them, great riffs and good growls.

[Ne Obliviscaris] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wa4zqBwPVE) are AMAZING, but maybe more melodic. Good deathy growls, with clean vocals too, and a VIOLIN. Love them.

[Amon Amarth] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw0pylT0Tg0) - they're Vikings, what else do you need to know? :)

If you want more melodic stuff, check out [Dark Tranquility] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddujei86caE), [Be'lakor] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbD9ev7AzKU), [Barren Earth] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9I_O7mS1sI), and [Insomnium] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBZ5SLJmfdw)"
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","Some amazing picks here. I just discovered Fallujah and Ne Obliviscaris a month or so ago and love both. Arch Enemy, DT, Be'lakor, and Insomnium are also all great picks."
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","Thank you :) Hardly anyone seems to know about Fallujah, which is a shame, but hopefully word will spread. And thanks to NeO I have to continually fight the urge to buy a violin..."
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","Ne Obliviscaris is amazing. Their new album ""Citadel"" is definitely one of my favorite albums of 2014.

Also, Be'lakor is supposedly coming out with a new album this year. :)"
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","It's a masterpiece to be sure. I didn't know about Be'lakor, I'll be sure to look out for it!"
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","Thank you!  Arch Enemy is now one of my tops.  I love how they ease you into it with a brutal appetizer then, finally, whet your appetite with the rest.  I think this may be my favorite type of intro since most of the songs I've heard involved them just smashing a riff over your head then screaming/growling at you for getting in the way of their guitar.  

EDIT: also, Ne Obliviscaris - Xenoflux makes me feel like Final Fantasy went brutal.  Love it!  Thank you, again!!!"
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on?

"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","Thought of some more! 

[Carcass] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaXS4nAx0jU)

[Meshuggah] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc98u-eGzlc) - technical death metal, an interesting if hard-to-get-into subgenre

[DevilDriver] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ySpk3ErFd0) - I consider this to be ""happy death metal"".

[Opeth] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhohQNdSt7g) - a bit different, but definitely worth checking out in my opinion.

[Kalmah] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcxlexAJycY) - more melodic death metal"
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","/u/Mostly-Harmlessish gave a great list already. I also recommend [Allageon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx9NLiA9Kk8). They're more technical death, but they're absolutely fantastic and their music videos are generally pretty funny."
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","Allegaeon is fantastic!  I love how it just builds and moves right into it instead of bashing you over the head right from the start.  Although, I can't say I'm totally turned off by technical, either. 

I actually just finished the dishes (and a beer) to this. :D"
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on?

"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","Well there's 30 years of death metal to cover so you need to narrow down what you like, then work from there. There's stylistic and regional sounds so the spectrum is huge.

Bands I'd recommended: Sarcofago, Deicide, Massacra, Bolt Thrower

As far as female leads go: there's a lot more than there used to be, but honestly women can do the guttural vocals just as well as anyone else and it can be hard to differentiate the singer's gender. Just listen to Fuck the Facts to see what I mean."
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","The Black Dahlia Murder - HP Lovecraftian lyrics with some great music"

Here are a few to get you going:

/r/metal

/r/thrashmetal

/r/sludge

/r/blackmetal

/r/folkmetal

There are so many genes and so many subreddits. Check the sidebar in /r/metal for more.

Also, Decapitated. Really enjoy those guys. Polish death metal."

I have to side with /u/metal_for_the_masses and say check out some of the metal subreddits, I also reccomend sifting through [bandcamp](http://www.bandcamp.com), [youtube](http://www.youtube.com) via recommendations in the sidebar when listening to bands you like, and even [Metal-Archives](http://www.metal-archives.com/).

I go through phases of discovery, and then having to go back and appreciate what I have discovered since it's new thing after new thing. Luck on your metal adventures!"
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","Since there are already some good general suggestions here, I will just list some of the bands with female lead and backing vocals that I would recommened.

[**Augury**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Augury/27517)'s [Concealed](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5EE63B8311F374EA) is one of my favourite albums of all time. The female vocals so seamlessly compliment the music like no other album I have heard since.

[**Visceral Evisceration**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Visceral_Evisceration/3026)'s [Incessant Desire for Palatable Flesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RRxT8aRUr8) is a very interesting album. Death/Doom with backing female vocals. 

[**Arch Enemy**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Arch_Enemy/10) is an obvious choice. I haven't really liked anything they have put out in the last 10 years but I do still enjoy listening to [Wages of Sin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8fuj5PoxMw) and [Anthems of Rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1rASg_RyA)


Leaving death metal...

[**Unexpect**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Unexpect/302) is an especially weird female fronted band from Montreal. [In a Flesh Aquarium](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCB2821CCA8148073) and their latest [Fables of the Sleepless Empires](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBA6854CDB1DDBF42) are two amazing albums.

[**Witch Mountain**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Witch_Mountain/10934) is great. Unfortuantely Uta just left the band but [Cauldron of the Wild](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=ALGLx1orRGw4U9y9QlGgWAvHsuFykB7e4H) is still an awesome album. I have only listened to their latest once, but I liked what I heard.

[**ReVamp**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/ReVamp/3540307644)'s [Wild Card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChQBR_QySHQ) is a great album. Saw them live and they were amazing. Floor has an amazingly powerful voice. 

Some others that I haven't listen to in a long time: [**Epica**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Epica/6716), [**After Forever**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/After_Forever/526), [**Within Temptation**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Within_Temptation/1006), [**Nightwish**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Nightwish/39), [**Leaves' Eyes**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Leaves%27_Eyes/26706)

**EDIT**: 
Also can't forget [**Into Eternity**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Into_Eternity/613) who are newly female-fronted. I have seen them play live 3 or 4 times with Amanda and she fucking kicks ass. Can't wait for a new album. If you haven't listen to them before it would be well worth your time to listen to [Buried in Oblivion](http://youtu.be/zwYtMTIDNgY) and [The Scattering of Ashes](http://youtu.be/pKycKUtb97M). Also check out Amanda's other band [**The Order of Chaos**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/The_Order_of_Chaos/123729)"
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","I'm digging Augury.  The female vocals threw me off at first but then I slowly began to understand.

Also, Arch Enemy was already in my top 5 but I wasn't ready for *Wages of Sin*.  THAT, is what I was looking for.  I like the buildup and the way they finally work into it.

And thanks for the *Scattering of Ashes* add on.  I love that, as a first time listener, you're kind of just along for the ride since you have no idea where the song is going! :)"
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","There are too many bands, and too diverse of sounds, to even begin asking for recommendations yet.  Just explore, explore, explore."
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","Thank you!  Yes, all I've been doing since this post is just click, click, click.  It's giving me a better understanding of what I like and a nice appreciation of how much really goes into the music.  Especially since the growls can be a bit off-putting, at first."

"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","I looked up *To Hell With God* and I really like it!  The growls at about 1:40 really drew me in.  I definitely hear Dethklok in there and it's very much my style.  And, after listening to the first song (*The Beginning*) of the Till Death Do Us Part album, I'm sold.  

Also, I just found [Atheist - Second to Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_1wwEETVXM) and I'm digging it.  Plus their [rehearsal footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCcC3AQgKOQ) shows some interesting progression.  I like it!  Thanks again!!!!

"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","I wish I could link you but I'm mobile right now but I can list off a few names. Death Metal isn't all the same and there just so happen to be a great bit of subgenres that fall under ""death metal"". 

Necrophagist is a pretty great technical death metal band and is typically the first band you'll hear from the genre. ( Fermented Offal Discharge, Only Ash Remains )

Fleshgod Apocalypse mixes elements if classical music with metal. It's pretty fast paced but equally beautiful. ( Test out their newest album and their EP titled ""Mafia"")

Amon Amarth is a melodic death metal that is only beaten by few. They even tour America so they're pretty popular. ( A Thousand Years of Oppression)

Be'lakor is another melodic death metal band and is unbeatable. Completely my opinion. ( From Scythe to Sceptre, Abeyance. Their newest album is ridiculously good. Even for untamed ears. )

If you want heavier bands, the lyrics tend to get out of control but the music is still good. Many times, this genres loses good music to the constant ""who can go faster"" and ""who can be heavier"" competition that newer guys are putting out. As far as good music goes, 2014 was a REALLY great year for death metal and you chose a good time to hop in. Go check out a list of albums that came out last year and you shouldn't be disappointed. A few examples of bands that really stood out are:

Inferi
Alterbeast
Archspire

Those three bands are pretty different and if you find yourself liking any of these more than the other, let me know and I'll see if i can spawn any new suggestions from that. Welcome to the genre though. Beware of elitists and have fun. Enjoy the music for what it is rather than what you associate it with and you'll love it just as much as we do. Cheers. "
"Newbie here: just heard Cannibal Corpse for the first time (Kill or Become) and now I'm intrigued. Where does a mild-mannered, engineering student/housewife even begin to get her brutal on? Any recommendations?","I would definitely listen to ""Death's"" first two real Death Metal albums, Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy. There are lots of brutal death metal roots in it and they are considered the first Death Metal band. Their later albums become more technical and melodic so those wouldn't really put your brutal on but they're still an awesome listen. 

[Death - Pull the Plug is a very good sample song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dYYUR21_G9c)

Behemoth is more Cannibal Corpse tiered and have that brutal sound but they are Blackened Death Metal so they sound a tad different in terms of instruments. Check out The Apostasy album and take a listen to some songs to see if you like it. They are very anti christian so be warned not to play them anywhere near a church. 

[Behemoth - At The Left Hand ov God  is a very good sample song as well and yes their of is spelled with a v](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zzz0YVEgT5U)

Good luck to you \m/

"Favorite Death Metal albums?","* Viraemia- EP

"Favorite Death Metal albums?","I've never listened to Viraemia or Alien Autopsy, I'll need to check them out! But the other albums are great"
"Favorite Death Metal albums?","Those are the weird ones of the list for sure. Viraemia was an über technical band and Alien Autopsy is an Industrial/Deathcore/Death Metal hybrid. They only have one EP each but they're both fucking great! "
"Favorite Death Metal albums?","Failed to add that Viraemia has some great slamming for what was a 4-5 song EP. Also, check out the materials used for recording that EP, the guitars are crazy. "
"Favorite Death Metal albums?","Oh yeah I forgot he plays a ten string bass."
"Favorite Death Metal albums?","Don't know why you're getting downvotes. It's true. The amount of strings used is ridiculous. "
"Favorite Death Metal albums?","Well I'll definitely check them out, thanks mate"
"Favorite Death Metal albums?","Reign supreme is easily my favorite death metal album. Every song is just crushing and perfectly done. The other album I think is tied with that for me is suffocation's self titled album. "
"Favorite Death Metal albums?","Infant annihilator: The Palpable Leprosy of Pollution 

Cradle of Filth: Total Fucking Darkness

"Decapitated - Three Dimensional Defect (Really good headbanging jam)","I feel like /r/deathmetal could benefit from a ""blacklist"" like /r/blackmetal has

But then again, I don't *actually* give a fuck. 

So, rock on \m/"
"Decapitated - Three Dimensional Defect (Really good headbanging jam)","Blacklist?"
"Decapitated - Three Dimensional Defect (Really good headbanging jam)","http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMetal/comments/20umlq/the_blackest_list/

&gt; The reason? It should be obvious enough, but in the interest of thoroughness I'll spell it out: posting eminent mainstays of the genre adds nothing to the community. As you'll notice if you peruse past posts, songs by the likes of Bathory, Mayhem, Darkthrone, etc. will receive a large number (30+) of upvotes, and will often receive zero comments, or if they do, they will be fluff like ""classic!"" or something similarly vacuous. This community was never intended to be a museum of black metal, nor even an archive. Its purpose is the elucidation of the darker regions of the genre where those with a pre-existing familiarity with it can share and interact with like cohorts. For newcomers to black metal, the blacklist will serve the dual purpose of a gateway to the genre, much as /r/metal 's does for that community. 

Basically, if the point of the sub is to discover new music it's kinda tedious to post the givens. Like going to /r/country (I assume that exists) and posting ""hey y'all ever heard of David Allen Coe??""

I kindof agree with the idea. But then I says to myself, I says ""self, maybe we should remain accessible to people who are just getting into the genre! I mean it doesn't cost you anything to skip over a post."" And then I agree with that too. 

So basically either way, I'm cool. And I just wasted everyone's time who read this far.

Rock on \m/"
"Decapitated - Three Dimensional Defect (Really good headbanging jam)","Ah ok, I see the point, but think it's unnecessary. I mean there are so many bands out there, others might be hooked on a new one and been listening to them for awhile and see a cannibal corpse post one day and be reminded of that Sun's and band. It's good for nostalgic purposes and like you said, newcomers. But, I'm in no control over that.

What made Bloodbath so absolutely amazing to me was that it was modern, with a classic throwback hint/feel.  These new songs are just completely straight up throwback.  While I absolutely appreciate and respect that time and that it happened to bring forth what we have now, it doesn't and has never had the nastiness and groove that Nightmares/Fathomless/Unblessing have.  "

"Need recommendations on similar bands to this.","I'll second Bloodbath being a fairly unique band, but for more modern bands with the old school Swedish death metal sound try Aeon, Entrails, Repugnant, Miseration, Ribspreader, Bastard Priest, Demonical, Funebrarum, Graveyard, Invidious, Krypts, Maim, Morbus Chron, Putrevore, and Tribulation. A lot of these bands don't quite have the same modern edge that Bloodbath has, though"
"Need recommendations on similar bands to this.","Entombed, Dismember. Get Bloodbath's Wacken Carnage CD/DVD. You'll thank me in a death metal voice."
"Need recommendations on similar bands to this.","I too love bloodbath and I've been trying to find another band like them to no avail. However I will recommend another band that scratches the same itch that bloodbath does and that is Black Breath. They're not pure death metal but they are heavily inspired by the same bands and share the riffrastic approach to songwriting. Both of their albums and their EP are perfect 10's for me. Check out this song and let me know what you think http://youtu.be/UBYxpsg9fCg"

"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","He's got Krisiun and Brutality on the list but no Suffocation? That's like putting the Monkees on a list instead of the Beatles. Also - no Deicide. "
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","I'm not a big fan of the New York/New Jersey scene, outside of Immolation (and Winter, but that's Death Doom), but I did enjoy the last Suffocation album. As well, Deicide's ""Legion"" is right outside of the Top 30 for me. I probably should note that the majority of the time, i'm not big on the bands who blast beat their way through most of their songs. I like things a little weirder, if I can get them."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","There's a lot of more recent metal that I enjoy better than the 90s stuff. This list doesn't do much for me."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","completely disagree with most of the list. Unquestionable Presence best death metal album ever?? you've gotta be shitting me. I realize this is all opinion but for an old school death metal list, i strongly disagree. No Symphonies of Sickness, No Deicide, No early Cannibal Corpse, No Pestilence, No Blessed are the Sick, No Suffocation, Warmaster was the best Bolt Thrower album, No Incantation, No early Malevolent Creation, No Terrorizer, No early Obituary, No Sinister, Leprosy and Spiritual Healing didnt make the list?  theres a lot of newer albums/bands i could name but was sticking with the OSDM theme. good grief. no."

Constructive contributions to a forum conversation? It's a thing that can be done."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","wasn't worked up at all. sadly for you, your post being a humanitarian didn't wind up staying at the top so that's not what i read first. you actually started the thread posting a list of picks of half these bands worst albums, putting an Atheist album as best death metal album of all time. sorry i didn't hold your hand through it. i conceded that it was all opinion. my ""douchey tirade"" hadn't begun til now. did you not expect some criticism for omitting Deicide's first album? or Effigy of the Forgotten? Slowly We Rot? The Bleeding? heres some constructive advice for your list.. explain your perspective on why, for example, Clandestine is ranked higher on your list than Left Hand Path. Or why a long-past-their-prime Bolt Thrower album is ranked at #2 while The Erosion of Sanity sits at #27. the list doesn't make sense to me. if you wanted me to just name off some of my old school favorites, i pretty much did. i dunno why you're so offended."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","Heh, e-fighting. Come on now."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","im not mad. wasn't trying to sound like an asshole. like i said, i just disagree."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","I strongly aprove of ""Unquestionable Presence"" being at the top. I can't wait for the new album. Kelly Shaefer said it will be to Jupiter what UP was to POT."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","If that's an actual possibility for them, then I wholeheartedly look forward to it. I mean, I am anyways... unless it's Elements II."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","Well I loooove Elements just as well (it's honestly my favorite Atheist album) so I wouldn't mind the new album album having similar, dare I say, elements to it. Atheist has thus far been successful in recording albums that are all clearly distinguishable from each other. I have reason to believe this album will be just as unique since it will be the first time Tony Choy will be writing an album with Steve Flynn. I just hope they can convince Rand Burkey to at least record something on the album even if he doesn't tour with the band."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","I'm not going to give any crap for someone liking 'Elements'. I kind of look at it the same way a lot of people seem to like the second Nocturnus album, 'Thresholds', and I can't stand it. In both cases, it was a severe departure for me and I just couldn't get into the change, but 'Elements' is far from the worst thing in the world. It is, after all, still Atheist."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","I get that many fans of Atheist and death metal in general don't like Elements because of its departure from the genre. As much as I love death metal, I get sick of it pretty easily and that doesn't happen with any of Atheist's albums, especially Elements. For me personally, Elements has by far the most replay value of any death metal band because it isn't a death metal album. There is at least as much jazz and other progressive aspects of it as there are metal (in my opinion, more so than the metal parts) and that's precisely why I love it."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","Everyone has an opinion and I respect their taste in music but Atheist at #1?  Two Bolt Thrower albums in the top ten?  Death way down at #25??? 
What about Morbid Angel - Blessed are the Sick, Death - Leprosy, At the Gates - Slaughter of the Soul, Obituary - Cause of Death, Dismember - Like an Everflowing Stream, and especially Possessed - Seven Churches?
Oh hell who am I kidding?  I love your list too but these are definitely some you should consider. \m/ \m/"
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","Dismember is actually one of the more recent additions to the 'like' side of my Death Metal portfolio, so i'm slowly picking up steam with them. I'm not fond of any Morbid Angel past Altars really (Covenant is alright), I've never been into At The Gates (Yes, I know) and Obituary are starting to grow on me, but those vocals were hard to adjust to lol. I'm also yet to bring myself to listen to Possessed, but I do like most of what Death has to offer, it's just not all that high for me."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","Appropriately stunned by your At the Gates admission.  :)  Being an older metalhead, Possessed is kind of a must to me, but honestly it's more for it's groundbreaking and historical value than anything.  Death, also, was so groundbreaking during their time.  The thing that makes them stand out to me is the way they evolved over a very short time.  Each album sounding tighter and different.  But to each his own!  Enjoyed your list.  Thanks for taking the time."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","I understand the importance of ATG, but it just never clicked with me. With some of them moving forward, I also didn't click with The Haunted, but more people seem to be on board with that opinion it seems. I do own ""Terminal Spirit Disease"" though and find it to be alright, I think I just heard ""Slaughter of the Soul"" too late after being told by too many people how amazing it was, so it was pre-ruined for me. Despite my lack of Death on the list outside of Human, I do have and enjoy all of their albums (And ""Scream Bloody Gore"" is a downright classic and I feel kind of jerkish for having it outside of my Top 30). Possessed i'm sure i'll get to at some point. Another album right on the outside of this list (Although not technically Death Metal) has to be Repulsion's ""Horrified"". I felt that of the classic 'Grindcore' albums, they were the ones who did it the best. ""Scum"" is alright, but that first Carcass album in that vein is crap."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","No Deicide, Death is at #25 (not to mention you chose Human over Leprosy or Spiritual Healing), and last but not least...NO SEVEN CHURCHES?! Nope."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","It's a good thing I didn't already explain all of those things or anything. You'll live."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","I get it, I get it. A completely self-serving list of your (shit) opinions. "
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","Is it bad i only have one of these albums"
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","Sounds about right to me.  I, too, only own one of them and it barely snuck on the list near the end.  Even that one is far from mandatory."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","Probably. Fix it."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","This is, however, just my opinion. The main link also provides samples from each album. What are some of everyone else's favorites? Old School, Modern, etc. "
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","Carcass' Heartwork for sure, Opeth's Blackwater Park, and The Black Dahlia Murder's Ritual are some of my favorites."
"Top 30 Death Metal Albums","While we're all entitled to our opinions, this list is pretty narrow in focus.  I think anybody would agree Blackwater Park not only makes the list, but goes pretty damn high on it, and quite frankly, embarrasses a lot of what's on the list."

"Let's talk about djent","Wasn't sure where to talk about this and since I mostly listen to death metal I figured I'd do it here. You guys only post links so a discussion is always good.

I've been hearing a lot about djent lately. Some talk about it like its a genre and call themselves djentheads. So are there really people dumb enough to consider djent a genre? It's a sound and not really a good one. What I've heard so far sounds like it's some kind of deathcore/metalcore.

Here's how it sounds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lai14aOv29M"
"Let's talk about djent","I really like djent. I also really like Death metal (technical/brutal/melodic/whatever). Both ""genres"" or ""styles"" have aspects to them which I enjoy at different times, and I think it will always be silly to call out an entire genre as ""not being a genre"" or not being good or not being heavy or whatever. 

Like, shit like this just gets me going (as does a lot of death metal). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEAx_5dF7Kg

EDIT: Also this: http://youtu.be/0gMcTIBiJZo?t=32m30s"
"Let's talk about djent","It's all shitty Meshuggah ripoffs imo

I really don't see much value in it as a genre, both in terms of artistic value and musical enjoyment. At best, it's trendy, bandwagon-y and derivative; at worst, it's straight up ripping off other, better bands.
"
"Let's talk about djent","K but listen to bands like Animals as Leaders or Periphery, these bands are at the core of the whole ""djent"" thing, and those bands (in my opinion) are trying to make new interesting music and trying to push the boundary of then genre (more AAL than Periphery but still). That's what djent should be, jazz infused metal with lots of virtuoso elements. Other good bands to mention are The Helix Nebula, and Sithu Aye. Like, it's totally fair to not consider it metal also, but I wouldn't call any of the bands I mentioned ""shitty Meshuggah ripoffs"" although I can understand your opinion. As in any genre, there are a lot of copy cats trying to piggy back on the sound. "
"Let's talk about djent","This is deathcore all over again. I get that all the dient kiddies can get on your nerves and that there's a lot of BAD copycats. But this ain't nu metal or glam metal. There are no studio execs. These folks are just doing music they like. Is it a fad? I don't think so but I could be wrong. Is it pretentious? Yes. Are they co-opting our music like glam metal and nu metal did? No, not really. Djent is still a pretty small niche within heavy metal.  "
"Let's talk about djent","I guess we could ask ourselves: What makes a genre? I agree that most Djent bands could also be considered Deathcore, Metalcore or Prog-Metal, but to me Djent has become a genre (or sub-genre) of it's own for the following reasons:
A: Tons of bands are playing it 
B: It became somewhat popular in the last few years 
C: It delelopped into a scene of it's own

I also don't really care about Djent, btw"
"Let's talk about djent","What makes a genre? Well, one sound certainly doesn't. "
"Let's talk about djent","Death Metal = Blast beats, frenetic riffing, growled vocals, dark subject matter

Djent = polyrhythms, jazzy chords, open note grooves, slower riffage, ambient background sounds

Both would appear to be genres with characteristics. "
"Let's talk about djent","Everyone always says ""djent"" bands are a ripoff of Meshuggah but when I hear ""djent"" bands I usually hear little to no Meshuggah. Just breakdowns with weird guitar patterns and lots of open notes "
"Let's talk about djent","True dat... Supposedly they coined the phrase ""Djent"" but every djent band I've ever heard just sounded like deathcore... Just more electronics and singing "
"Let's talk about djent","Only things I don't like about it, is that they feel the need to add in electro-garbage half the time, and for whatever reason they make an attempt at singing... 

But, it's not like there was some official meeting to make Dubstep a genre, or Jazz or even Death Metal. If you have enough people that like a sound, eventually other bands start to copy it, a bigger fan base grows, and eventually it's recognized as its own genre. If they want to use an onomatopoeia as the name for their music, who are we to stop them? If we all did that, I think it'd be pretty entertaining... ie: Deathcore will now be called ""Jug Jug Jug Breeeee"""
"Let's talk about djent","Indeed, but those genres came from something and sound different from what they evolved. Or devolved if you will. It's not the sound, it's a sound. One sound doesn't make a genre. If it wants to be called a genre it should have it's own trademarks, just like death metal has blast beats, growls and lots of tremolo picking."
"Let's talk about djent","Let's talk about good music instead."
"Let's talk about djent","With enough bands trying to replicate a certain ""sound"", you can bet your ass it's a genre. I enjoy a few bands from time to time (Intervals, Cloudkicker), and I love me some Meshuggah, but it's usually pretty repetitive and talentless music.

Edit: as a drummer, I feel like I appreciate the groove, polyrhythms, and beats a little more than melodies as well.."
"Let's talk about djent","It seems rather boring and overdone. Some chug chugs and noodling over them. Although these bands seem to rip off Meshuggah (one of my favorite bands) i think they lack the complexity of material/rythym and boil it down to boring useless songs with horrid vocals. As with some other genres of metal, i am not a fan of this by far, but to each their own. That's what makes metal so great IMO. "
"Let's talk about djent","Agreed, whatever floats their boat. It just slightly bothers me that they call it a genre when it's clearly not. "
"Let's talk about djent","What makes it clearly not a genre though? Personally I can agree with it being more of a ""style"" that gets tacked on to a genre (Like ""djent"" Prog metal, Animals as Leaders, The Helix Nebula, Vildhjarta), but there's still a lot of characteristics associated with bands like that and other bands. Like, if you say ""djent"" there's a lot of bands that come to mind, same as if you were to say ""Death Metal"", ""Power Metal"", ""Deathcore/Metalcore"" etc. "
"Let's talk about djent","I'd agree with with this. Like brutal death metal or old school death metal. It can be with some genre but not genre on it's own because it's only one sound."
"Let's talk about djent","Yea.... i don't get it either. "
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Personally I think deathcore is way more hated than it should be. There's a lot of deathcore bands I really enjoy as much as I do listening to death metal, but Job For A Cowboy, Thy Art Is Murder and Through The Eyes of The Dead shouldn't be hated for using deathcore technique, but that could just be me. What do you guys think?"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Just listen to what sounds good to you, man. Don't get wrapped up in the endless sub-genre circle jerk. Just listen to what makes you slam your head, and fuck what anybody has to say about it. "
"Opinions on Deathcore?","I'd give you gold if I could, but I can't. So...

[Here you go](http://i.imgur.com/z0YcDf9b.jpg)"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","I appreciate the sentiment. "
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Deathcore is, in my opinion, the simplified, less musically interesting version of Death Metal. Combine that with a much shittier fan base and you've got no reason to listen to it.

Anyone who chimes in to stand up for deathcore crowds: I urge you to go to a show with a classic old school death metal band and a deathcore band. In my case it was Carcass and Suicide Silence. Obviously you can guess who I was there to see. The division between the carcass fans and SS fans was amazing. The carcass fans seemed like pretty regular metalheads. The SS fans were belligerent blowhards breaking people's noses on purpose and parading around with their shirts off, showing off their Monster Energy drink tattoos. "
"Opinions on Deathcore?","I think you damn near hit it right on the head there. The lack of respect I think comes from how simple and similar such a huge amount of deathcore bands sound and then I think the hatred side comes from douchebag scene kids acting like douchebags and starting fights/not helping people up in the pit/doing their little fighting invisible ninjas routine without regard to fucking people up. You should be bruised after spending some time in the pit...you shouldn't need to go to the damn hospital.

That said, I've definitely heard some deathcore that I liked quite a bit and I fully recognize that it shouldn't be entirely discounted across the board. Also, at least deathcore doesn't tend to have the godawful whiny vocals that metalcore tends to have, so they've got that going for them, which is nice."
"Opinions on Deathcore?","This was my experience when I went to see Nile and Suicide Silence opened for them. Scene kids showed up for Suicide Silence and left when Nile came on stage. Fucking left Nile. That's enough of a reason right there for me to not like them. At least I had the common courtesy to stay in the room for Suicide Silence. "
"Opinions on Deathcore?","I saw a show from that tour at Slims in SF.  Nile and Suicide Silence.  Lots and lots of scene kid/bro types with brand name tattoos who didn't understand the idea of moshing vs. punching people in the face"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","I dunno. If you don't want to see a band, I don't think you should obligated to stay in the name of common courtesy. 

I personally think they might have enjoyed themselves, but anyone can do as they like."
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Fuck deathcore."
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Why though? Some of the bands have some really cool shit going for them. "
"Opinions on Deathcore?","In general, deathcore bands and fans come from very different cultural origins. As such they have very different aesthetic cues, which shows in the music they play. Same goes for me. For example, I'm a black metal fan first and foremost. So I have a particular distaste for modern sounding death metal with clean production. Similarly, a deathcore fan may have his idea of what is ""good"" rooted in the idea of ""brutality"" and thus omit songwriting such as riffs or solos. Generalisation, but you can see my point."
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Thanks for your support!"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","[deleted]"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","I like early Red Chord.

And some Despised Icon."
"Opinions on Deathcore?","I love both equally. Unfortunately though, the ratio of good Deathcore bands to bad ones isn't so good, which is why the genre gets so much hate, in my opinion. You just have to look for the good bands hidden amongst the tidal wave of crap ones- for example Ovid's Withering, Lorelei, Aversions Crown etc.

Also, I can totally understand that some people dislike it for the annoying fans."
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Most Deathcore is crap because it's much easier to be a mediocre musician and make a Deathcore album than a mediocre musician making a Death Metal album.  This make the ratio of shit-to-gold very high in the Deathcore genre so that you usually have to wade through a ocean of shit to find what little gold there is (like say, Infant Annihilator, who actually make Deathcore look not-half-bad).

Throw in the fact that you get some really idiotic fucks at a deathcore show (as amply described by witch_trial) and you basically just don't want to waste too much time with it..."
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Trust me man I used to live across the block from Chelsea Grin playing backyard shows every weekend in 2008. It was hell x)"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","I think Animosity and some Born of Osiris is cool, although I haven't listened to animosity in years"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","There's nothing wrong with blending Death Metal with Hardcore (or Metalcore) in my opinion. What does suck is that after a while it became a contest to see who could stretch their ears the biggest and who could play the most breakdowns in a song. I feel that's why it gets so much hate and why the term ''Deathcore'' has such a negative connotation.

[Proof that Deathcore doesn't suck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XYLiau108E)	"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","I love Beneath the Massacre and then I was at a show and somebody broke my nose for no particular reason"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Some of it is good. But to me, it's a simplified version of death metal. Fewer awesome riffs, and more talentless breakdowns."
"Opinions on Deathcore?","A lot of deathcore is over-produced brutality for brutality's sake bad music but I still like a lot of deathcore such as Aversion's Crown, Infant Annihilator and Acrania. I think people who listen to a couple of Suicide Silence tracks (while I like them) don't get a full overview of deathcore. There are loads of different styles of deathcore in the same way there are plenty of different styles of death metal. My favorite styles of deathcore are slam deathcore (fusing slamming/brutal death metal with hardcore, bands such as Ingested and Acrania) and down-tempo deathcore (more oriented towards the beatdown hardcore side of things, bands like The Acacia Strain and Black Tongue). These are styles of deathcore not really represented by Suicide Silence and Chelsea Grin but they hold more musical merit than a lot of the run-of-the-mill deathcore."
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Just like what you like. I'd be crucified for saying I like early Whitechapel, but IDGAF"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Thy Art Is Murder is just about death metal, they're awesome.
"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","They were more death metal on The Adversary. Hate is just another run-of-the-mill over-produced deathcore album. Unfortunate, really. The Adversary had some really tasty shit on it.

I just got angry when I heard Hate. The snare sounds like absolute shit. It drowns out any guitars when there's a blast beat going. Annoying."
"Opinions on Deathcore?","I actually really liked Hate, though I am not paying too much attention to the production. I like the lyrical themes and Immolation is just my type of song. I understand about production getting in the way: I only like a couple of Bloodbath's studio albums (The Fathomless Mastery is one) because they don't do Bloodbath's sound justice. I like the Wacken Carnage live set - the production/sound/mix is perrrrrfect."
"Opinions on Deathcore?","They're pretty border-line for me, to me I'd rather just call them simplified death metal but then no one has any idea what I mean"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Yeah, what do you mean by simplified death metal? I have my own categories too, I know how that goes."
"Opinions on Deathcore?","TAIM is death metal, but they're taking death metal type riffs, and simplifying them. Usually using one or two different notes for the riff"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","[deleted]"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","I dislike most deathcore, but there are a few good bands. Rose Funeral and newer Carnifex are incredible."
"Opinions on Deathcore?","I used to be really against deathcore. The scene in the UK was dominated with Bring Me The Horizon who aren't the greatest band to represent deathcore. A couple years ago though my friend sent me some Martyr Defiled and I really liked the energy in the songs, but I was more under the impression these were a diamond in the rough.

 More recently I found Ovid's Withering and they really changed the game for me, absolutely top class band that have an amazing talent for creating lore, and every song is part of a greater story. Their actual songwriting is brilliant too in my opinion. There is some quality riffing in there and the breakdowns (which I will admit I totally vibe off when they're good)  are incredibly well done. They led me to find other bands such as Slice the Cake and I've been vivid off this new wave of deathcore ever since. "
"Opinions on Deathcore?","You just reminded me of Ovids WIthering! I've been wondering what that bands name was for years. I saw them live back in 2012 and I never remembered their name till now

"Opinions on Deathcore?","Job For A Cowboy hasn't been deathcore in years. Have you listened to any of their new album? It fucking slays!"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Yeah it's amazing, but I've heard it in the realm of deathcore for years as well so I'm just trying to be relatable haha"
"Opinions on Deathcore?","Fair enough. I think getting nick schendzielos on bass has taken them to the next level. I just annoys me that they're still getting shit for being deathcore, when they've been more technical/progressive death metal for the last couple albums. "

"Job for a Cowboy ""Sun of Nihility"" (OFFICIAL)","Fuck what anyone has to say these guys have come along way from the time I first heard them when Ruination came out, and an even longer way from Doom and their deathcore years. I hope all their songs on the new album are this good and better. Damn seems like everybody is stepping up their music game with trying to be proggy and technical though haha, which definitely isn't a bad thing."
"Job for a Cowboy ""Sun of Nihility"" (OFFICIAL)","Yeah pretty much! I love that technical vibe they've got going now! "
"Job for a Cowboy ""Sun of Nihility"" (OFFICIAL)","I really don't get the hate Deathcore bands (or -core bands in general) get in all these subreddits. The metal community is so ridiculously elitist, it's damn near embarassing to be part of it. Music is still music, no matter if you like it or not. There's no reason to run around and put other people's work down just because you're a sour and sad excuse for a human being. Live and let live I suppose.

Also, cool song. I haven't listened to JFaC since Doom, but it's cool to hear how they've changed."
"Job for a Cowboy ""Sun of Nihility"" (OFFICIAL)","For longtime fans of Death Metal, Deathcore represented a severe dumbing down of the genre. Death Metal was always the genre that was the most technical but also often very experimental. In about 2005-2006, I remember all the Deathcore bands hitting and it felt like they were just cookie cutter copies of the easiest to play Cannibal Corpse riffs. Over and over and over. It even seemed like the logos turned into the same font: that I-just-scrawled-our-name-on-a-wall font. I dunno, it was just disheartening. It was like watching a great TV show for 5 seasons and then the 6th is just full of clip shows of the highlights of the last 5 seasons, and you're sitting there going, ""Wait, I wanted to see what happened next!""

And it wasn't just about ignoring it and letting the fans have their new genre, because it became ubiquitous. A lot of big death metal acts started touring with bands like Whitechapel or JFAC or Suicide Silence. It was inescapable, so of course people complained. "
"Job for a Cowboy ""Sun of Nihility"" (OFFICIAL)","I Hated JFAC at first, many years ago. Once i finally came around they had already released Gloom, but i really liked the direction they went in. I like the old stuff now just as much as the new stuff. This sounds killer"

"What Do You Think Is The Most Overused Technique In DM?","Other than blast beats."
"What Do You Think Is The Most Overused Technique In DM?","Not necessarily a technique, but down-tuning as low as possible. Now everyone tunes down to drop a to try and sound heavier. Hell, back in the day Cannibal Corpse tuned to e flat and sounded heavier than most of these bands tuned in a. It's seems like a cheap way to try and sound heavier."
"What Do You Think Is The Most Overused Technique In DM?","You've got a point, but at the same time I would consider it more of like the standard for Death Metal, with a seven string, A# tuning is a very versatile tuning. Plus there are bands who tune even lower than that and barely use the versatility that it offers.
"
"What Do You Think Is The Most Overused Technique In DM?","That's true, there's nothing writing with the tuning itself. I was thinking more about how bands tend to only chug on the bottom 2 strings and stay within the bottom 5 frets. So I shouldn't have said the problem is the tuning, but the way they use it."
"What Do You Think Is The Most Overused Technique In DM?","That I'll agree with. If you're going to seven string, use the other damn strings haha"

"What Do You Think Is The Most Overused Technique In DM?","I mean, don't get me wrong, I love fast shit, but I think the art of contrast is somewhat forgotten these days.

"Looking for a band of a rather unusual taste","I'm curious if there is a death metal band out there where all of their songs basically describe mundane every day things, like washing the dishes, taking the dog out for a walk, and playing sports, etc. Or any other metal band for that matter. Would anyone know of anything close, if not spot on, to that?

[Note: Not trying to make fun of death metal or anything; I'm just really really curious and interested]"
"Looking for a band of a rather unusual taste","[""Metal in Inappropriate Places""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v41N5KwJc84) has no lyrics, isn't really a band and, well, it's a joke, but it's pretty mundane! 

But yeah, now I am wondering if a band would be able to do something like you described _without_ being humorous. Because death metal pretty much revolves around an ""epic"" quality, and if you try ""Epic Doing the Dishes"" it becomes an instant parody. It's also aggressive, and if you add aggressiveness to daily routine the lyrics will probably sound too silly or pretentious, and involuntarily funny."

"New Edition of Choosing Death - revised and expanded","Definitively an amazing read. 
It was a bit dated, as we all know that Metal is an ever evolving genre composed of an infinite number of subgenres.

Some very slight errors here and there that were accurate at the time the book was published.  

As far as breaking down the history. It's incredible.
  
I would recommend reading Black Metal: Evolution of a cult."
"New Edition of Choosing Death - revised and expanded","Choosing Death isn't bad, but it focuses almost exclusively on a specific handful of bands/musicians and I think it gives a very limited view of what was happening in the underground at that time, and also really skims over the development of the sound (I have not read the expanded edition)

It's not bad music and I have always been a fan of the old school Entombed heavy gain distortion but this (song) feels like a step back. Bloodbath was one of the few bands that felt like they had a really good progression going for them, no matter what kind of line-up changes happened. I felt the same way about Nightmares Made Flesh when it first came out and now it's one of my personal favorites. I'm hoping that I will feel the same way after this record drops, but I can't help but think that his vocals are more aligned with Black/Doom and not so much Old School Swedish Death Metal.

edit: Mameli's vocals would have been fine in another band but i loved the first 2 albums so much at the time then the change was too drastic imo. Van Drunen was perfect for their sound at the time."

"Good God someone help me find some bands. Or a genre entry point.","I gotta get away from black metal for a while. I have been trying to get into death metal for a while down. I do thoroughly enjoy it. But it seems everywhere I look. I'm finding something very generic. Or some goat grunting about how he screwed some dead dumpster fetuses or something. (In other words silly lyrics) I guess I just haven't really found a entry point. I would start with the old stuff. Yet I don't really know any bands or the history. Im fine with any genre or subgenre of Death metal. So far I have enjoyed. Abysmal Dawn. Immolation. Death and Soulburns new album. Dont know if these are good but hey. I like them. I like when the songs are able to progress. Flow. Add a lot of ideas and elements but staying on the more ""thunderous"" side like Immolation. I would greatly appreciate it if you guys could help. Thank you all very much. "
"Good God someone help me find some bands. Or a genre entry point.","[Possessed] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6FZBIZ0Xbs&amp;hd=1) - A lot of folks consider this to be the first DM band, some say its more thrash metal. 

[Suffocation] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVEW9o_XfQ8&amp;list=PLlpsJiGuS_nOn6Qvl35ik4X1AN7b7WlhM&amp;index=3&amp;hd=1) - Frank Mullen, along with Ross Dolan from Immolation, were two of the first vocalists to use low pitched growls.

[Morbid Angel] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIAqU3PE8Vg&amp;hd=1) - The first death metal band to get signed to a major label, very popular and very influential. 

[Atheist] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emWZBSEIQY&amp;hd=1) - Helped pioneer technical death metal along with Death.

[Autopsy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSWZTS1KK38&amp;hd=1) - Known for their gross and sick sound, helped pioneer death doom.

[Cannibal Corpse] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSWZTS1KK38&amp;hd=1) - Chris Barnes is considered legendary for his insanely low vocals. Some people love CC, some hate them. I personally like them a lot. 

[Demilich] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT76I8R9RBw&amp;hd=1) - Weird fucking death metal, crazy vocals. It turns some people away but you might love it.

[Entombed] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6exw6xT0oo&amp;hd=1) - Swedish death metal pioneers. More punk influenced and slightly more melodic. The guitar tone will slay you.

[Dismember] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gtUcFRGmWI&amp;hd=1) - Another very influential Swedish DM band.

[Gorguts] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4Cro2yxRjw&amp;hd=1) I linked their most widely revered, but check out all of their music. I think you'd like their newest.

[Nocturnus] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeEnSqaoQuk&amp;hd=1) - The first DM band to use keyboards. Very spacy and technical.

"Good God someone help me find some bands. Or a genre entry point.","I listened to Belphegor's newest album last nine. It was recommended by Infidelamsterdam. Thoroughly enjoyable. I will have to check out the black death scene. I'll look at dark descent records today. Thanks for your help and recommendations."
"Good God someone help me find some bands. Or a genre entry point.","I really struggled to get into DM as well for similar reasons, and even today I like DM but not as much as I like other genres because of the same general stagnation - I'm not saying ALL bands do it, there's a few good ones out there still that are doing new cool things. Having said that what really *really* helped me get into DM was reading two books whilst listening to the songs and albums they talked about. My two books are [Choosing Death](http://www.choosingdeath.com/) and [Swedish Death Metal](http://www.bazillionpoints.com/shop/decibels-2008-book-of-the-year/). Both excellent books - I thoroughly enjoyed them and would recommend them as entry-point to anyone.

That aside, I also love DEATH. I find their albums very different and with more to say beyond the usual gratuitous-gorefest. I also really enjoy Cannibal Corpse, to me they're like the AC/DC of DM in the sense that you *know* what you're gona get when you pick up a CC album... they don't fuck around.

If you're still down for some more reading I also recommend you get [Mean Deviation](http://www.bazillionpoints.com/shop/progmetal/) - also killer book and written by Jeff Wagner of Broken Hope. Not just 'prog' it opened my ears to a lot of awesome DM as well for sure."
"Good God someone help me find some bands. Or a genre entry point.","Awesome. I love reading. Il check them out. Thanks so much."
"Good God someone help me find some bands. Or a genre entry point.","you're welcome - enjoy the reading! have you checked [Dayal Paterson's BM book](http://feralhouse.com/black-metal/)? it's also pretty good, and his second book of interviews is great as well. "

"Good God someone help me find some bands. Or a genre entry point.","Disincarnate-Dreams of the carrion kind.    Edge of sanity-Purgatory afterglow"
"Good God someone help me find some bands. Or a genre entry point.","My favorite death metal band is a relatively new group from Germany called Deserted Fear.  They play old school style death that's reminiscent of Death or Obituary while having a really rich and deep sound that draws me into their music.

[Call Me Your God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2_YNVV4IzE)

Also Revocation.  You can't go wrong with a little [Revocation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdMvNiyq8Hs)"
"Good God someone help me find some bands. Or a genre entry point.","I don't know how much grind you like in your death, or how lefty you like your lyrics, but two bands that have done their homework quite nicely are Napalm Death and Carcass. 

This being /r/Deathmetal and all, I'll recommend any Napalm Death release after the EP Mentally Murdered is pretty damn good deathgrind. Starting in Fear, Emptiness, Despair on through to Words from the Exit Wound they play a lot with death metal and a bit of groove metal and grindcore here and there. From Enemy of the Music Business and Order of the Leech onwards they return to a very, VERY nice form of deathgrind. Hell, some of the songs are geniuenly catchy in that hardcore-ish kinda way.
Lyric-wise, they tend towards the left of the political spectrum, from anarchism, socialism, social critique (particularly of capitalism), feminism, the whole gamut. Kinda like all those annoying lefties you meet at college, minus the annoying.

Now, as for Carcass, Heartwork and Swansong are where it's at. Their lyrics are about social critiques and feelings. They're on the more brutal sides of melodic death metal (Heartwork) and death n roll (Swansong). 

Now, if you like your death metal Florida style and have non-standard lyrics it'd be pretty much mandatory to listen to Death from Leprosy onwards and World Downfall by Obituary. Death focused on a host of issues, from the personal (Bite the Pain) to the public (Suicide Machine) to relationships between folks (Low Life). Obituary meanwhile tackle environmental issues, like folks not giving one about pollution from the point of view of the polluter (Don't Care) to denial of real problems (Solid State). 

Ah, but you're quite the amateur philosopher. If you like what the Frenchies have done in the past 50 years (nigh indecipherable explanations of society) then I encourage Cynic. I suggest you get ask what the lyrics mean cause I haven't a clue (something about the Cynics I guess?). Music-wise, they're awesome. Period. Or at least awesome in Focus, Traced in Air, and Re-Traced (I've yet to listen to more recent material).  Their material is kinda reminiscent of those 70's progressive rock bands like Pink Floyd and Yes. It's very nice all around. Lots of different moods and and proggy parts without making 10 minute wank fests.

Finally, merging social critique, tree hugging (the kind we should all honestly get behind) and a bit of philosophy here and there is Atheist. The jazz fusion influence is not lost on anyone who gives it a chance. Think if Miles Davis toned down the song lengths and made an album with Evil Chuck. Yeah, I think that that describes Atheist nicely. Needless to say, Unquestionable Presence is the album of choice, though mind you, I've yet to listen to their more recent output."
"Good God someone help me find some bands. Or a genre entry point.","Thank you. I never really known there was some death metal bands that hit so close to home with there lyrics. I like Death a lot. Pull The Plug being one of my favs. But i'm new to them. I tried Carcass. There new album I was iffy on. Very talented musicians. I just didn't feel the lyrics really went anywhere. But nevertheless. I am always willing to retry a band. I will check out the Carcass albums you mentioned. I've never even heard of Cynic. So thanks for that. I also had no idea Atheist was proggy. So nice. Thanks so much."
"Good God someone help me find some bands. Or a genre entry point.","Sure thing buddy, glad you already like Death and are willing to give Carcass another shot."

"Good God someone help me find some bands. Or a genre entry point.","I get to where I cant listen to certain metal genres any more. I normally just take a long metal brake.

But everyone needs a break once in awhile to keep it from becoming stagnant."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Esp2iTstj_Q

Falling from his majesty into his ill repute, banished by the kingdom of the word of living truth.
Feeding off the excrement's of bible prophecy, captured and distorted into something said that would never be seen.
Prophet in the act of thee, resent the vows of old, nullify your standing in light of heavens hope.
Paralyzed and cry defeat ensile to the lord, bleeding from the inside out upon the cross of the Christ you ignored.
In the eyes of god you failed and faltered in his heart, angel of no mercy you descend from once you start.
Worthless in the face of thou reside in his duress, powerless against thy sword reviled by ones you have blessed.
Time of torment, will besieging, eyes abhorrent, life depleting, lies devoured, thou defeated, Christ the coward, god is dead
Dead
In his eyes you will die !!!!!!!!
Fester in the wounds without no dignity or soul, blind eyed to the realm of god is what your future holds.
Relish by catastrophe in battled by deceit, forfeit what is right for wrong to fall from his grace and the sight of his son.
Ravaged by the instruments of all that you command, powerless inside the faith heavens holy plan.
Thou who have forsaken you exile you to death, fleeing from the path of god, despised in this world and to what you confess.
Tragedy invites the truth in time you will receive piling on top of you and all that you believe.
Lost to the intention and the writ of compromise, sour in reflection to the eyes of the lord and to all of his kind.

Time of torment, will besieging, eyes abhorrent, life depleting, lies devoured, thou defeated, Christ the coward, god is dead.
In his eyes, your despised, endlessly, dead to thee..."

"If I like Septic Flesh, Death, Entombed, Jungle Rot and Bolt Thrower, what should I listen to next?","I like those bands because the vocals are deep but still intelligible, I really hate Cookie Monster vocals. I like the music of old school bands like Obituary and Morbid Angel too but the while the vocals are intelligible it just sounds like someone barking into a microphone. I like deep vocals that sound like part of the song, not just throw on as an afterthought. What should I listen to next?"

"If I like Septic Flesh, Death, Entombed, Jungle Rot and Bolt Thrower, what should I listen to next?","Bloodbath has a good set of deep vocals. 'Nightmares Created Flesh' has Hypocrisy front-man Peter on vocals, while everything else is Mikael Akerfeldt from Opeth, who has a legendary deep growl while maintaining pronunciation.

My personal favorites are the EP 'Breeding Death', full-length, 'Resurrection Through Carnage', and the later EP, ' Unblessing The Purity'. The Fathomless Mastery sounds an awful lot like later Morbid Angel and has some catchy/ominous stuff!"

It's fucking perfect! Bass that I can hear, wild guitars, great drumming that has oomph to it, and deep vocals that I can still understand without a lyric sheet for every word. I'm almost scared to listen to any of their other albums because I'm afraid they won't be as great as this one!

I had never tried guttural vocals before but Eaten got me so pumped up in one drunken moment that I just belted the words out and surprised the shit out of myself.

Your whole core should be involved, power comes from your abs and lats I've found. The throat is used for shaping and the mouth for annunciation only. 

I'm no professional voice coach and everything I say comes with the ""I can't guarantee you're not going to injure yourself"" disclaimer, but it's one thing I can say without tempering with humility that I have some expertise in. So lemme know if you're having issues"
"Bloodbath - nightmare made flesh one of the best albums I listened to in a long time","Thanks dude, I will! I've always been confused about the whole ""from the gut"" thing. What does that mean, what does it feel like?"
"Bloodbath - nightmare made flesh one of the best albums I listened to in a long time","You know when you're dry heaving over a toilet bowl after a wicked puke sesh, you've got nothing left to give but your body keeps trying to wrench more out of you? Try to recall those muscles that are involuntarily contracted in your abdomen that ""force"" you to puke...your abs and obliques primarily. That's where your power should come from. 

So stand up tall, open up your chest and posture, take a few HUGE breaths to expand your lungs, then on the last one use those muscles to expel the air out of your lungs like you're trying to blow the pigs' house down. Of course your diaphragm is naturally going to do a lot of the direct heavy lifting but contracting those core muscles keeps your core tension up and thus a firmer platform to push against. It'll all make sense once you feel it. 

Once you've done that a little bit, then just use your throat to ""throttle"" the air coming out, and fuckin growl!! This is where your own unique style and sound comes through, so I won't go too deep into that. Just get to a place where others can't hear you and you're not embarrassed to be loud as fuck while you're figuring it all out, and experiment. Go hard, exhaust yourself. And when you think you've had enough and can't get any lower, get mad, sack the fuck up and dig deeper. 

The one thing I hate to see is dudes that drop their jaw to get this artificially low sound. You've probably seen them, bedroom rockstars on their PC microphones doing vocal covers. They're quiet, sound like shit, and look like they're about to fellate the mic. The depth of your voice comes from resonance in your body cavity as I explained above, not from the little bit of space in your mouth. Or even worse...people that cup the mic. It's fake, it sounds like shit, and you look stupid. Do you think Glen Benton or Peter Tagtgren ever cupped a mic? If you do it right, you will be LOUD and sound BRUTAL without the busch league tricks guys use that don't know what they're doing. Sound guys and recording engineers will love you. Not to mention the crowd.

Your mouth is for articulation. That's why guys that do the jaw-drop/mic cupping have no chops and sound like ""bwahbwhabwahbwah reeeeeeee""...because their mouth is employed doing stupid shit rather than being free to punctuate and annunciate. Once you've gotten the hang of your overall sound from your throat, lungs and core, then you can use your mouth as you do every day to achieve whatever level of articulation you're going for.

I used to play drums when I had a band, we would practice in my garage so I would just go out there every day and play my drummers kit. I'm up in Chico. "

"Death Metal Masterpiece - Vital Remains Dechristianize","I was also listening to this album yesterday. So epic. I can't wait to see them in April with Testament, Exodus, Nails and Nuclear Assault. I wish Dave Suzuki was still with them but it should be sick either way.

This album also has one of my favorite DM album covers. Not the one shown in the video above but the one with the Romans raping the girls while Jesus gets poked with the Holy Lance"
"Death Metal Masterpiece - Vital Remains Dechristianize","I bought it from eBay, and I also had the more explicit cover. It was a total surprise though, so when I got it I was really confused. It said something like ""Not for sale outside of the Russian Federation"" on the back, which I thought was pretty funny. "

"NAILGUN MASSACRE - Where's the Head? [2015] (old-school from the Netherlands)","This one really rubbed me the wrong way.  I don't know if it was the mediocre (at best) vocals or the generic swedeath riffs (WHERE'S THE HM2???)."
"NAILGUN MASSACRE - Where's the Head? [2015] (old-school from the Netherlands)","Hmm, I can definitely see why this wouldn't appeal to others. The riffs aren't exactly revolutionary and the vocals are pretty ""goofy"" compared to most death metal bands. I like these guys though. Their sound is chunky and would make a great soundtrack to a cheesy B-horror movie."

"Growls","Who was the first metal singer to growl? "
"Growls","Pretty sure it was Tiny Tim"
"Growls","i am of the belief it may have been the band Possessed (often credit as being among the first death metal bands)"
"Growls","See: http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/2j94sw/why_the_growls/ 

The growls have roots in punk and it's really hard to say who was first in metal. Does grindcore count as metal? If so I'd guess somebody in early grindcore."
"Growls","Modern grindcore certainly counts as metal but early grindcore was very firmly punk. My guess is that the shift towards growls in metal occured right around the time grindcore started to hop the fence."
"Growls","grindcore is not metal. it is closer to punk. in my opinon. "
"Growls","How do you figure?

BTW, I'm not being an ass. I'm genuinely curious."
"Growls","honestly... its just the way it is. grindcore evolved from punk bands. hardcore punk with the dbeat got faster and faster until the skank beat was more common due to the speed. look at napalm death, among the first grindcore bands. their early efforts like scum are essentially fast distorted punk. 2 and 4 chord songs played to fast punk beats. thats grindcore. sure these days its so mixed up theres a lot of metallic influence undoubtedly. but it was born from punk. dunno why i was downvoted to be honest."
"Growls","The first growl was from the whos song boris the spider. If you're referring to only in metal I have no clue but Google should be able to give you the answer :)"

"Misery Index - The Harrowing &lt;The Killing Gods&gt;",""
"Misery Index - The Harrowing &lt;The Killing Gods&gt;","I saw Misery Index in GA before I knew about/appreciated them. They opened for Skeletonwitch (who I went to see), who opened for Job for a Cowboy. Misery Index put on the tightest live performance I have ever seen, in all of my 12 years of seeing metal shows. I was absolutely floored at how tight their show was. This isn't to say that Skeletonwitch did a bad job, they put on a fantastic show, but Misery Index' sound was flawless, and I didn't even listen to them before that show, you could just tell that they had their shit up, down, left, right, backward, forward, whatever. Now, the completely arbitrary and totally subjective standard I use to determine the caliber of a band's live show is scrutinized by how tight the band sounds, in relation to that Misery Index show. 

One thing that stuck out was the consistent velocity with which the drummer used as he was playing. Every blast beat was heard clearly, and his fills were so fucking fast and smooth. JFAC was an egregious violator of this; the drummer's fills had accents the same way Christopher Walken punctuates, and you could really only hear the snare intermittenly during blast beats.

There have only been 3-4 bands ever that I've walked into a show not knowing anything about then left with show a PROFOUND appreciation for them."

"Gojira - Space Time","uh... yea ... thanks."
"Gojira - Space Time","I think that they have a sound that is very diverse and can be interpreted in many ways. I interpret it as death metal, others may interpret it however they want, prog rock, melodic metal, whale metal, technical metal. They can't really be described with one genre so I suppose they're not full death metal, but they certainly have death metal elements; blast beats, fast double base, and many 6/8 phrases that I hear in most if not all death metal bands. I know many people dispute whether or not gojira is death metal but personally as a fan and musician of death metal I enjoy them very much and I think they fit in nicely with most death metal bands, just my thoughts. "
"Gojira - Space Time","Your description of the characteristics of death metal lead me to believe you do not know a lot about death metal. But hey, thats ok."
"Gojira - Space Time","I wasn't trying to generalize all of death metal with those three characteristics, I was just stating some things that goijira does that can be described as death metal elements. They may not be as brutal as some bands like cattle decapitation or aborted or pathology, which is probably closer to just ""brutal death metal"", they have a kind of an old school feel to them, when I saw them live they covered a morbid angel song, which I think is where they get much of their influence, growing up listening to old school death then putting their own twist on it and making it into something entirely different, and I think it's really refreshing to listen to. Make of it what you will not everyone has to agree haha. "
"Gojira - Space Time","I wouldnt deny Gojira definitely have death metal elements most notably from Morbif Angel who were a lot more atmospheric and spiritual than their peers."
"Gojira - Space Time","Are you saying that fast double bass and blast beats are not characteristics of death metal?

You come off as being very patronizing and without really explaining what you think death metal is."
"Gojira - Space Time","But hey, thats ok."
"Gojira - Space Time","It's Technical death metal/Groove metal. You can definately hear the death metal elements. "

"Chiptune 'remix' of Death Metal band Arsis. Face of My Innocence","Gotta be honest, that sounded really bland because none of the ""instruments"" you used had any feeling of timbre to them. Made it sound like a bunch of old cellphones ringing at the same time. The bass drum just sounded like a mush of low pitched noises because there was no real attack or release to it (not a native speaker, hope you understand what I'm trying to say). Still nice effort though. I also tried my hand at some LSDJ a few years ago and realized just how hard doing chiptune is."
"Chiptune 'remix' of Death Metal band Arsis. Face of My Innocence","Thanks for the input. The instruments are authentic wavs taken from game systems. I kinda wanted to keep the synths simple since so much is going on. Chiptune is harder then you think. Chiptuning death metal? Wicked hard. I'll keep what you said in mind next time."
"Chiptune 'remix' of Death Metal band Arsis. Face of My Innocence","Ever given LSDJ a shot yourself? It gives you some nice tools to modify the various sounds a gameboy can produce. Also listen to some rainbowdragoneyes if you haven't already. He's really good at the whole chiptune metal thing and might give you some inspiration."

"Suggestions for melodic death that isn't melodeath.","I hope this is ok to post here. I searched first.

When it comes to ""melodic death"" we can roughly divide that term to refer to bands that are actual death metal and happen to be exceptionally melodic and, on the other hand, NWBHM-with-growls melodeath. 

I'm looking for bands that we could call ""melodic death"" but that would be more welcome here than over in /r/melodicdeathmetal. 

I'm thinking something like Arghoslent but without all the ""yay slavery!"" and whatnot.

Thanks!"

Of course you're correct. I don't mean to say they're separate genres. I've heard other people use the terms to make a distinction between styles of melodic death just for the sake conversation and I think that is a useful way to talk about styles if only for the sake of threads like this.

I don't like the production of bands like death, morbid angel, cannibal corpse and i'm looking for something more modern sounding along the lines of Aborted, Decapitated or how the production on The Satanist by Behemoth sounds. Open to any suggestions, Thanks :)"

Also, 

Psycroptic (their second album might just be God)

"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","The newest Wormed has been my favorite new death metal since it was released."
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","My suggestion is to branch out a bit as many bands in DM have very unique sounds and styles.  Here is a list of my favorite bands and notable songs:

* The Black Dahlia Murder
 * What a Horrible Night to Have a Curse
 * Carbonized in Cruciform
* Origin
 * Anthisesis
* Nile
 * Kafir
 * Unas, Slayer of the Gods
* Gorguts
 * Le Toit du Monde
* Dying Fetus
 * Destroy the Opposition"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","Thanks man, I think Dying Fetus are great, Nile and The Black Dahlia are good too and i've been meaning to listen to Gorguts and Origin, cheers man :D"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","Dude, Origin-Saligia"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","Gorguts have been around for a long time"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","Indeed they have."
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","Cryptopsy - Once Was Not. 

This album is very special. Very brutal, with mesmerizing riffs and like literally the, (*one of the*), fastests drummings of any DM-album ever. 
This song is just a fucking deathfest, though kinda slow in the beginning.
*Endless Cemetary* - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-CeddVf2Zc"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","HOLY SHIT another Endless Cemetery fan!!! I love that song to death and was actually listening to it only two hour ago. "
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","definitely check out nile. annihilation of the wicked is a good starting point. 

also what do you mean you dont like death's production? are you talking about their early stuff or their progressive period?"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","I listened to the reissue of Leprosy because everyone said how great it was but its not very powerful or in your face, its quite a muddy production if that makes sense? For instance comparing it to Dying Fetus who have that really powerful, driving production, that's the kind of stuff i prefer personally"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","also dont totally give up on death. their later albums are absolutely vital for technical death metal. chuck schuldiner is one of the greatest in death metal, for his technical ability and his songwriting 

[Death- Spirit Crusher] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOXLc3rmK10)"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","I'm definitely open to listening to more Death, i've managed to get a big list of stuff here that i can roll through in the next couple of weeks :)"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","I just listened to that Death song and the guitar work is brilliant, if the rest of the album is in a similar vein then i'll definitely be giving it a listen!"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","aaah i see. their last album sound of perseverance is a huge step up. very clean , nice levels on everything. 


Pig Destroyers album Terrifyer probably has my favorite production. grindcore isnt ordinarily my thing but it hits like a ton of bricks. the guitar tone just annihilates and there are a surprising  amount of awesome riffs, which grind usually lacks

"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","Gorgasm is a tried an true avenue (been around foreeeeever) for brutality, and they just came out with a new album (got to see them this past Saturday and they almost made my dick fall off). You might want to try older Devourment as well. Putrid Pile has super brutal riffs and great production quality. Unmerciful's cd Unmercifully Beaten is one of my favorites ever. Another band as far as really good production, try Abysmal Torment."
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","Cattle Decapitation are huge in the modern death metal movement. Their latest album ""Monolith of Inhumanity"" is fantastic. Humanure was another great album. Travis Ryan is a monster of a vocalist. Listen to their song ""Living, Breathing Piece of Defecating Meat"""
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","One of my favourite DM songs and quite possibly my favourite DM album, its incredibly melodic and out right brutal at the same time"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","dig lifestalker, but kingdom of tyrants is lovely
"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","Opeth (from Still Life all the way up to Ghost Reveries). Necrophagist is another great band as well."

"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","Try Dismember, Kaamos, and Torture Division. Maybe Tribulation as well."
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","ENTRAILS!!!!!!"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","Inanimate existence, fallujah, arkaik, necrophagist, obscura and the faceless. Those are all the best in my opinion."
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","Depends. Melodic, or the brutal shit?  
Melodic:  
ANYTHING AT ALL by Katatonia. They are the highest in the melo-death scene. They do something kind of similar to what Opeth does, but better (Opeth openly agrees with this). Can be described as atmospheric depressive music instrumental wise, kind of, but it has lyrics over it.  
Opeth. Because they're also pretty swell.  
Satariel's album Hydra (specifically Scattering the Timeweb, Claw the Clouds, and The Springrise)  
Kalmah (Neoclassical meets death with a bit of Finnish folk flavor)  
Insomnium, especially Across the Dark and One for Sorrow  
Dark Tranquility, especially the songs The Treason Wall, Out of Nothing, and Weather the Storm (Under Insomnium's name, it was a guest appearance).  
Deathspell Omega (dark melodic): Paracletus and the song Salowe Vision especially
Ne Obliviscaris: Portal of I (whole album is a masterpiece)  
  

The Brutal Shit:  
Ingested: Endgame, Titanomachy, and The Surreption  
Mulk: La Putrilogie (cybergrind/pornogrind album)  
Acrania: Susceptible to Retinal Based Reprogrammability  
Suffocation: Human Waste  
Beyond Creation: The Aura  
Necrophagist: Entire discography, really  
Pusvomit: Stoned to Death  
Rings of Saturn: Dingir (Lucas Mann is a dick, though)  
Infant Annihilator: The Palpable Leprosy of Pollution  
Nails: Abandon All Life (more grindcore depending who you ask, still dark and brutal as anything)  
Vomitous: Empires of Great Enslavement  
Modern Day Babylon (more djent, really, but still good)  
Deicide: The Stench of Redemption (great soloing, which is rare in death metal)  
Guttural Slug: Two kids from Finland doing some CRAZY slam shit. Two albums out, and they're growing at an amazing pace production/writing wise.  
Shadow of the Colossus: Self titled  
"
"Modern Death Metal suggestions?","I'll definitely give some of these a listen! Cheers man. I was meant to be seeing Acrania last friday in my home town but they had to pull out due to a family issue :("

"Trying to start a death metal band, I would love to get feedback","https://soundcloud.com/jackson-k-3

So far only a bunch of no vocal demos. The later ones have better production value because I got a better understanding on how to mix. 

Would this be something you would enjoy listening to? Is it even death metal? What kind of vocal styles would work best with this type of music? I was thinking of doing thrashy vocals for fast parts and switch to guttural ones for slower instances.

Vocals and soloing are the hardest parts for me, so I'm still working at it. Soon enough, I have a drummer and bassist who will come in so I can move this project out of my bedroom and on to the stage.
"
"Trying to start a death metal band, I would love to get feedback","I'd say you're off to a great start!  I'm enjoying listening to it, sure.  I guess I'd categorize it as melodic death/thrash, so I can hear a mix of thrash and death vocals working well.  My main criticism would be that some riffs seem to repeat a bit too often for my taste, but vocals will help a lot with that.  Still, when everything is in groups of 4 it gets a bit predictable, you know?  Or, say, I noticed several riffs that alternated between holding long notes and tremolo-picking for several repetitions (Song 1, Song 6).  But it's sure as hell way better than anything I've made in my apartment so far, and I imagine I'd be in the pit if I saw this band at a show."
"Trying to start a death metal band, I would love to get feedback","nice, thanks! I will work on the predictability. Once I add vocals, I'd say you wont notice the repetitions because I know how to plan out the vocals to make the songs ""come alive."" I can't wait to get started on it."
"Trying to start a death metal band, I would love to get feedback","Yeah, you're leaving space for things yet to come.  Something the band I'm in is arguably terrible at. :P  Get a full band to jam these songs a few different ways and you'll see them come together.

I'm curious what you've used for the drums on those tracks?  I'm pretty new to writing and haven't found a VST I like for programming them (or are you playing an electric kit?).  Whatever you're doing ends up sounding pretty decent!"

I just looking around and looking at the crowd, then all of a sudden he is walking out and toward me direction. My fucking eyes grew big as shit, i was fucking star strucked, he noticed it and the look on his face was almost like ''...fuck...'' lol but pretty damn chill  he gestures his hand out to acknowledge my fandom and said "" whats up man""  I shook his hand and said "" you are a cool ass dude"" and he thanked me and kept it moving.   I sure he was on a mission of some sort, I wouldnt wanna hold him back anyway."

I honestly think the whole album is plain brilliant."
"At The Gates - At War With Reality","Yes, me too. I red that people don't like it, but I have no Idea why."
"At The Gates - At War With Reality","People like different things, you will always have people arguing ""only their old shit is good"" without actually listening to ""new garbage"" at all!

But i do agree with some of them, metal is taking a questionable direction.

Anyways this album is pure gold.

One thing that always amazes me is how replayable it is! 
I listened to it a shitload of times and i still get the same feeling of joy. 

And yes, Slaughter of the Soul is better, but that doesn't make this album any less brilliant."
"At The Gates - At War With Reality","I got this album on vinyl, it's a real winner. Different from their older stuff, but in a good way."
"At The Gates - At War With Reality","As a fan of AtG for about 20 years, I  bought At War With Reality two months ago. 

I've probably listened to it 20-30 times at least. The key changes and melodies/harmonies are just what I'd expect, plenty of dynamic textural changes. 

I freaking love it. I would have said the terminal spirit disease EP was my favorite release by them, but after this album, I'm not so sure anymore"
"At The Gates - At War With Reality","Exactly!"
"At The Gates - At War With Reality","I started getting into AtG and Carcass around the same time, and they both disbanded before I got to catch em live.

Saw Carcass a few years ago, was amazing. Didn't buy tickets to MDF to see AtG. Kicking myself for it.

The new Carcass after 17 years was pretty good, but the new AtG? 

It's a classic IMO. The intertwining bass guitar melodies and harmonies and changing drum textures, it gets stuck in my brain all the time. 

I'm honestly happiest that a band I respect so much is doing new material 20 years later that isn't like, metallica's LOAD or something, it's not this washed up faded imitation of itself, this is bad ass materiel, and they didn't release garbage in between. 

They might come back here again, and how can I have anything but respect for that? 

Trvest godfathers ov melodic metal \m/

People that are AtG fans that diss this album? I dunno, maybe they just haven't listened to it enough. So much has changed in global world culture, your day is so distracted by internet and infinite amounts of music and sound and stupid memes and videos, and really absorbing a piece of music,  especially this good, requires a focus. 

The first time I listened to it, I was like, well, it was ok, it sounds like AtG, but, the more I listened, the more I was just like, everything about this album is exactly what I wanted it to be. No track disappoints, every track delivers.

"I wonder how metal will sound like, say 50 years later. Will it be even around till that time?","When predicting the future, it's always difficult to say.

However, if we look at other genres that have emerged in the past, Rock, Blues, Jazz, R'n'B etc. They all have their own following and all are getting bigger. Metal is no exception to this. Hell, even classical music is as popular today as it ever was back in the 18th century.

With a growing world population, and the advances in how music is actually played from person to person, there can be no limit as to the possibilites in which music can be made, or how it reaches its fans. Dubstep, an non existent genre a decade ago is currently huge. I can guarantee it will still have a large following in 10 years time (though maybe not hold a huge percentage of the market like now).

As for Metal? Well it's certainly evolved from the days of Black Sabbath. And I can see it continuing to evolve. Djent seems to be very popular at the moment, and shows metal has come along way since the 70's, but thats not to say people aren't reviving the old ways in a new light (see The Sword).

This evolution can also be seen live (though rarely at the moment) with solo artists swaying away from the traditional 4/5 man band. Drums can now be replaced with a laptop using EZ-drummer, and guitars can go this way too. What we see is something akin to Kraftwerk; several people on stage twiddling knobs instead of aggresively playing their instruments. 

Traditional setups will always have a following however, just the way that Blues has always had a following since the 20's. The people rarely change, but the times do."

"Portal - 13 Globes","There is much more to Portal than just a dark mysterious image. The music is quite unique. Their use of dissonance and abrupt tempo changes is impeccable.

"Female growlers","Grace Disgraced, Dehydrated, Abriosis and Bloodhunter are what I can remember from the top of my head. I assume you only want death metal bands? Because I can recommend more if you are okay with other genres. You can always try looking at this [blog](http://womenofextrememusic.tumblr.com/). "
"Female growlers","Thanks!  Actually others would be fine.  I like Otep, for example.  Any band where the lead is a female growler."
"Female growlers","Well in that case, I can recommend Dracena, Bestial Holocaust and Nocturnal (if you like black/thrash), and Darkened Nocturn Slaughtercult for pure raw black metal. Decadence and Triton Enigma are pretty good thrash/death metal bands (and have the same vocalist). There's also Angist (death), Divahar (black) and Darkestrah (black).  
Edit: spelling."

I am certainly not new to moshing and understand the risk of doing so but have never gotten any injuries besides a bloody nose and some casual soreness. The majority of the day after the show I was not sore at all. Then as soon as I got off work that night my shoulder started to hurt and by the time I was driving home I started having trouble breathing. Now my entire left shoulder blade and back is killing me anytime I take a step, breathe deep, or move either arm. I am open to any suggestions to stop this hell."

"Trying to get into cattle decapitation where should I start?","Haha yea there are very few bands that I have actually put forth the effort. Cattle, acid bath, the black dahlia murder and cephalic carnage are the main ones. There are more so I guess there's several...not few. Welp"
"Trying to get into cattle decapitation where should I start?","If you like Monolith you'll like the one before it, The Harvest Floor.  Great stuff."
"Trying to get into cattle decapitation where should I start?","I didn't get into them until I saw them live. They're fuckin great to watch. "
"Trying to get into cattle decapitation where should I start?","I'm going to have to agree with you on this. I use to not really care for them. Thought the production and drums on ""Karma Bloody Karma"" were shit. All changed when I saw them live for the first time. Summer Slaughter 2007. Holy fuck. Amazing band. Love them now. "
"Trying to get into cattle decapitation where should I start?","Nothing worse than fucked production affecting drums, Deicide suffered from this numerous times.  

The next big mistake is overbearing vocals.  Lets have some really talented music totally obscured by vocals that have been turned up to 11.  Can't actually name a band for this because I don't give them a look in once I notice it.

"Trying to get into cattle decapitation where should I start?","The first album I got into was also Monolith. My advice is work your way backwards. That's how I did it. And loved it. Monolith has worked it's way into the top of my favorite albums of all time. "
"Trying to get into cattle decapitation where should I start?","I always liked their more well known songs like success..(is hanging by the neck, testicular manslaughter, and so on. The Harvest Floor is what really got me into them, and when Monolith dropped my head exploded."
"Trying to get into cattle decapitation where should I start?"," I started out with Monolith of inhumaity, I fell in love with them. my favorite tracks are kingdoms of tyrants and lifestalker and of course the whole fucking album.
 The harvest floor is pretty good album. I like "" Into the public bath"" it's so vicious, love this chorus;
  ""We walk through shallows of shit
We're wading in it
Urea, mucus and human jit
We love the taste of it..."" 
 Karma, Bloody, Karma brutal as fuck, its unrelenting. I dig ""Alone at the landfill""  I feel like when I listen to it I am soaring in hell. ( as corny as that sounds) But the jem for me is ""The new dawn"" that song has one of the best guitar riffs I have ever heard. 
 All there earlier shit is ok check that out too.

"Amon Amarth - Destroyer of the Universe",""
"Amon Amarth - Destroyer of the Universe","Their music is basically radio disney music with distorted guitars, double bass and guttural vocals... I think actual radio disney version of cannibal corpse is more brutal https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Zmkevry5g"
"Amon Amarth - Destroyer of the Universe","Aren't distorted guitars what made metal different from other music? I would think most bands would sound pretty weak without distortion and guttural vocals. Way to go on being a fucking tool though"
"Amon Amarth - Destroyer of the Universe","I just find it counterproductive to mix the Death Metal genre with this time of song structure. Feels low energy to me. Not trying to start a flamewar."
"Amon Amarth - Destroyer of the Universe","Sorry I was a prick. I can't argue that heaviness is being lost in many bands with the melodic tag. I just thought the argument kinda sucked. Amon Amarth isn't the heaviest band ever and the melodic tag proves that, but to compare it to Disney music seems far-fetched considering even cannibal corpse sounds weak when done in Disney scale. I usually don't take heavy bands very serious when I hear they are some sort of melodic music, that alone is counterintuitive to me. "
"Amon Amarth - Destroyer of the Universe","Yeah I was being a bit of a prick myself with the Disney comparison. Well at least we can agree on the melody being a factor."

"The perfect song?","I still think Entombed - Left Hand Path is a perfect song, still my favourite death metal song after all these years. From the beginning scream, to the memorable riffs, to the second half which still gives me goosebumps. Not to mention the atmosphere of that song and the incredible lyrics to boot. A perfect, unforgettable slice of death metal.

"The perfect song?","[Katatonia - Unfurl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNLvmLXuGdQ&amp;feature=kp). I know it's not typical death metal, but the arrangement of it is perfect. The lyrics are also excellent, as can be expected of Katatonia."

"The perfect song?","The Black Dahlia Murder - Map of Scars. That's my choice because I just love how greatly the instrumentals fit together and make an awesome tone."
"The perfect song?","To me, their best song is also one of the shortest. ""I Worship Only What You Bleed"" is a perfectly crafted song. Every riff is more satisfying and beautifully toned than the last. Fuckin great band"
"The perfect song?","Another one of their short ones is awesome: Death Panorama. Fucking love that shit, and every song on that album."

"The perfect song?","Thank you for agreeing. How is something like that considered pop? Like what factor makes it pop?"
"The perfect song?","the fact that it's a very popular mainstream band as far as ""metal"" goes. Headlining Warped Tour, selling their clothes at Hot Topic, etc. But i digress...they have some very technical songs, great compositions, and amazing vocal work IMHO.

"DM recommendations for a Deathcore fan","Hey guys,

I come in peace.
Don't flame me. 

Just wondering if you have any recommendations of bands that have clean production. A lot of DM bands I have heard have pre 2005 sounding production.
I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just not what I enjoy completely.

Do any of you guys have any DM bands with clean production?

I really love Opeth, Between the Buried and Me, Fallujah, Born of Osiris (The New Reign) etc, if that helps narrow down anything. 

I just want to expand my taste, deathcore is boring after a while. (due to constant chugging in many cases)

Thanks :)"

"DM recommendations for a Deathcore fan","Definitely need to check out [Abysmal Dawn](http://youtu.be/wedhP9yTjdk). One of my personal favorite straight up DM bands. Also try [Behemoth](http://youtu.be/YqnEBRZ6jS8), [Cattle Decapitation](http://youtu.be/szOlMfoN-jU), and [Dying Fetus](http://youtu.be/ttEQ-APseaQ) to name a few.

"DM recommendations for a Deathcore fan","My personal suggestions, having come from deathcore into death metal a few years ago are mostly comprised of Brutal or Slamming Death Metal. Slams are more elaborate than breakdowns and piqued my interest early on. 

Try these:

Note: Not all of these bands are slam and in fact most aren't. These are just bands that I'd recommend if you said ""turn me"".

[The Faceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w6AnNiNiEY) You like deathcore? You'll love The Faceless.

[Abominable Putridity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWKLN6boesU) Slammy Goodness.

[Vomit the Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2SVhlZfuUU) Bass Drop. I think you'll like this.

[Extermination Dismemberment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvSTYZ0P-rY) In case you were wondering if there were more bass drops in death metal.

[Beyond Creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BluvF_ozYJs) Highly recommended for any death metal first time listener.

[Archspire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7CcJ-QuTd4) These guys deserve a medal.

[Bloodbath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiONOj4nAqY), [Aeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7eq6KiOYEM) and [The Resistance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02x7oMAon8) are a few good bets for you imo."

I'm more a new school kinda guy, so cleaner production is more my speed. Necrocracy is the first Exhumed album I listened to, and I loved it. Then I worked my way backwards. When I heard Gore Metal, I really dug the riffs and all the tunes in general, but I was really turned off by the shit production.

Super cool to hear those jams in modern quality."

Gore Metal was one of my first extreme albums and a favorite to this day. I've seen them live a couple times in the last few years and hearing songs like ""Open the Abscess"" with the more speed metal feel and chops of ""No Guts..."" always reminds me of why I got interested in death metal to begin with. Exhumed is at the top of their game right now and while I'd prefer a new record, this'll do. "

"Some Funeral Doom for a Change","This jam has been hitting me hard, lately.  I pursue music for the feelings brings to the surface in me.  I like brutal death for the intensity and visceral human disgust.  I like death metal like Behemoth's ""Evangelion"" or ""Apostasy"" for the rage and spirituality, and black metal like Gorgoroth, Carpathian Forest, Horde, or Mayhem for the raw, unfettered spirituality.  Obviously, the lines get blurred amongst the dozen bands I celebrate and experience, but funeral doom generates an entirely unique sensation.  The sorrow, heartache, and general bleakness creates something totally unique.  Besides generally ALL Paramecium, this has become a new favorite.

"War themed DM","War Master from Texas and Asphyx are the first two that come to mind. Maybe Centinex but I've never actually listened to them. Also although this is more black/death, give Conqueror, Revenge, and Axis of Advance a shot."
"War themed DM","War Master is insanely good. One of the best death metal bands to come along in probably the last 15 years if not longer. 

Along with the J Read bands listed here I'd suggest Heresiarch and Diocletian. Both are more on the death side of war metal and use a fair amount of doom"
"War themed DM","Good suggestions, might as well through Witchrist into the mix as well"

"War themed DM","Upvote for AoA. Epic band."

[Murder Suicide](http://youtu.be/rgfl0gPtI8A)

"War themed DM","Since nobody has mentioned them - panzer Christ most of their songs are todo with ww2 German side not that they are nazis that just find it cool. 

As a taster and since I am German myself this is a changed version of the German panzergrenadier song the original is very similar. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rfccahPtgUg

Also some cool lyrics and voice in this song wait until 1 min to hear an out take of privat Ryan it fits great so beginning is schindlers list which gives a nice evil tone

IR have no need for your useless traditional song structuring."
"Impetuous Ritual - Despair","Well that's kind of a shitty response to someone bothering to listen to this. 

I'll be less nice and more honest. This in no way is death metal. No fast OR complex guitar riffs. No fast or complex drums. No fast or complex anything. Just a vocalist using a pitch shifter to give him an almost-growl and half-assed, slow guitar to back him up."
"Impetuous Ritual - Despair","&gt;No fast OR complex guitar riffs. No fast or complex drums. No fast or complex anything.

None of those things are requirements of death metal, never have been. Also, there's no pitch shifting in this song, or from this band....nice try. the fact that you don't ""get"" this or Encoffination tells me all I need to know about you. You've been force fed a cookie cutter version of death metal that is neither challenging or original, just ""fast"" and seemingly ""complex"".....predictability is weakness."
"Impetuous Ritual - Despair","No, you've misread me completely. I just don't like this song. There is nothing to ""get"". Maybe this band has more, better stuff. Using this song as a gauge, I don't care to spend the time to find out. This song does not fit MY definition of Death Metal.

I'm a bit of an old timer. You and this song remind me a LOT of Flipper and their fans back in the 80s. None of it fit any definition of punk music. Anyone who didn't ""get it"" just didn't understand punk. Just another hipster in another scene. 

I get that you really like this, and that's freakin great! Keep on promoting what you like to listen to. But, it's kinda shitty to try to talk down to anyone who disagrees with you."
"Impetuous Ritual - Despair","It's not the disagreement that I scoff at, to each their own. I scoff at the spreading of misinformation i.e. ""this isn't death metal"". If you don't like it, fine, but don't go around tryna act like it ain't what it is just cuz you ain't hip to it."
"Impetuous Ritual - Despair","That wasn't Death Metal."
"Impetuous Ritual - Despair",".....In what universe?"

 It wasn't Death Metal."
"Impetuous Ritual - Despair","[They disagree](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Impetuous_Ritual/3540295292). 

Though it is blackened....it's still undeniably death metal."

No.  The track you posted was not Death Metal.  Why would you post a non-Death Metal track to /r/deathmetal ?

If Taylor Swift changed her profile to say ""Death Metal"" and listed a page on metal-ballsax.com that doesn't make her music Death Metal.  It would only be Death Metal if it sounded like Death Metal."

everything barnes's has done vocal wise since then has sucked dick aside from his last two albums with six feet under.  i do like some of the six feet under albums, but the bottom line is his vocals suck.  

george fisher by far surpasses chris barnes.  if barnes wasnt kicked out, im pretty sure none of the musicians in corpse would be as good as they currently are.  "

"Dying Fetus - Grotesque Impalement","I agree. There isnt much out there as purely brutal as Dying Fetus. I grew up near thesr guys and my old hardcore band opened for them way back in 94 at a bar in Baltimore. Great dudes. Fucking heavy."

It's a shame too, considering what a unique album it is."

The polish death metal scene had plenty to pick from."
"Decapitateds new albums","Decapitated hasn't felt the same since Nihility.  Which is understandably what happens when you're drummer who is a big part of your sound dies.  Soreption's new album sounds like what Decapitated should sound like.  Decapitated has progressively moved more towards mainstream metal and further from DM."
"Decapitateds new albums","I like soreptions riffs but the songs are just a few repititions  of the same catchy parts nihility has the best riffs ever but organic hallucinosis for me is the best written and produced album ever. Got any other suggestions? Judging off the early release of the newest decap song they won't be going back to their old ways"

I listen to mostly tech-death so I would recommend Alterbeast, Archspire, Omnihility, Inferi, Aborted, Wretched.  All have 2014 albums and they're really good."

"How to Appreciate Death Metal","I used to hate DM until I heard Carcass. I'd say it's important to look at the vocals as another instrument instead of trying to hear lyrics or compare it to any other form of singing."

My ex hated death metal but she loved this tune"

"Decapitated - Spheres of Madness. This song never gets old.","It really upsets me this is the only song from this album they ever play live anymore :( they may have played Mother War ONCE the few times I've seen them

"Decapitated - Spheres of Madness. This song never gets old.","Funny you say that. I love Decapitated but this was one of their more repetitive songs and it always got boring fairly quickly to me. "

"Decapitated - Spheres of Madness. This song never gets old.","love that song!!!"
"Decapitated - Spheres of Madness. This song never gets old.","this may be unwarranted, but I love (read: hate) when people shit on deathcore but then love this song. It's just as chuggy as lots of deathcore. Mind you, there's buttloads of bad deathcore but if your reason for disliking it is ""too many breakdowns"" but you like this or say None So Vile era cryptopsy....i dont get it."
"Decapitated - Spheres of Madness. This song never gets old.","I don't like the *core tag. It wouldn't be hard to classify almost every death metal band into their own subgenre. People need to stop breaking it up and just enjoy good metal."
