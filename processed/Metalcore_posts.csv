"My band Glory &amp; The Fall just dropped our debut EP for free, check it out!","I like it."
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It",""
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","The mix is a little rough around the edges, but Sams vocals are good enough to carry it.

Edit: HOLY FUCK THEY ARE SO AMAZING LIVE I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THEM AT THE ROUNDHOUSE"
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","YOU'RE GOING TO THE ROUNDHOUSE SHOW?!?! SAME BRO! CAN'T WAAAAAIT!"
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","YESSIR I AM FUCKING GASSSSEEEDDD LOL"
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","hahahahaha fuck yes! See you in the pit man! Are you psyched for ETID as well??"
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","I'm gonna lose my fucking shit for Dead Man Talking hahaha

And I'm not really familiar with Every Time I Die, where should I start? "
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","Same here bro can't wait! 

For ETID their set closing song of choice always seems to be Moor so give that a listen as it's both easy to learn the lyrics to and a lot of people are gonna be yelling that. Exometrium is also a killer song and they'll be playing that. Honorable mentions also include: The Great Secret, Decayin' With The Boys, Thirst (they'll probably open with this) and Underwater Bimbos From Outer Space is sick too!

Also give The Disconnect a listen to, it's by the opening band Counterparts and they're such an outstanding band but I fear they're gonna get little to no love from the crowd as they're not exactly metalcore or very well known but yeah the final lines of The Disconnect are brilliant and you need to learn them to shout out to the band and give 'em some love, Ghost is a great song and so is Outlier if you're willing to give a little more attention to them, they have great stage presence and I would happily pay to go to a show with them headlining.

I'm not familiar with Blessthefall so I can't help there!

Hope this helps, see you there man!"
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","I checked out ETID and Counterparts. I can hear the punkier side of metalcore in ETID, it's interesting, but not really my thing. Counterparts on the other hand, holy shit I love this. It's fucking heavy but has a slight post hardcore sound to it. Gonna show this to my mates who are coming with me to the show. See ya there!"

"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","Also Dan is the drummer mate, I know they look identical but it's gonna be hard for Dan to tune his guitar sat behind a drum kit!"
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","LOL I always get them mixed up. I know Tom is the one that writes it so he's the guitarist... Duh. I'll edit it."
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","These dudes are elevating metalcore to another fucking level. More bands should strive to be like Architects. "
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","I was already hyped because i'm going to see them live for the fifth time next saturday. This video gave me even more hype. Holy shit."
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","Kills it? Sure he sounds great live but he skips *sooo* many words."
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","But then try screaming for an hour, it's not easy even with experience."
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","He isn't skipping the words, he is holding the mic to the crowd, it just isn't picked up in the video I think"
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","Sometimes he's holding his mic out to the crowd, but I think there's a few points where he just can't finish the whole line and stops."
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","I agree with you. I love this band but nothing is more anti-climactic than when the singer comes to the best parts of that particular line and then it just goes silent... I know all about how hard/tiring it is but you go to hear the singer not the crowd. "
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","Yeah, you're probably right lol I posted this after hearing the first 2 songs and then I watched the rest. Still a great performance though."
"Architects Live Pro-shot - Sam Kills It","Holy fucking shit the way Sam handles the last lines in These Colours was fucking mind-blowing, I've been to about 4 Architects shows and have never seen him do lows that well and for that length... Incredible band."

"Fit For A King, Ryan's final scream in ""Warpath"" live. This guys vocals/lungs are out of this world.","I'm on tour with him and he said the other day that when he tracked it in the studio, he did the full scream for the length of the breakdown. so he finishes the scream, all red faced and out of breath, and the producer says ""okay that was a good one, let's get one more and double it so it sounds stronger""

so he does the full scream again, eyes closed, straining through it and almost passes out. he finishes the scream and looks up at the producer and everyone in the other room is laughing really hard. it turns out they didn't need a second scream. they just wanted to see him struggle to get a second one out. thought it was pretty funny. 

he is a phenomenal vocalist. he nails that scream every single night on tour. "
"Fit For A King, Ryan's final scream in ""Warpath"" live. This guys vocals/lungs are out of this world.","That was impressive. Even more impressive is at the end he just belts out even stronger when you're thinking ""holy shit when is this guy going to take a breath?"""
"Fit For A King, Ryan's final scream in ""Warpath"" live. This guys vocals/lungs are out of this world.","Some vocalists just do what they can to keep getting the note out. When Casey Crescenzo did an AMA on /r/posthardcore he was asked about the really long note in [this video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQvcGK0MWJM&amp;t=207), and he basically said that he almost blacked out from it.

"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?",""
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","There are honestly plenty of bands that get a lot of hate they don't deserve. The first band coming to mind being Emmure. You see so many ""0-0-0-0-1-0-1"" comments on things dealing with Emmure. If you are listening to Emmure in hopes of finding mind-blowing riffs,you are listening to the wrong band. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","This is something that always blew my mind. People that actually listened to more than one song of emmure knew that they weren't a technical band and still liked them and somehow people were still complaining. I for one liked and still like what Emmure has put out. "

But really, listen to ""stairway to hell"", gr8 song.
"
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","To be fair, I think a lot of hate towards Capture The Crown was more due to their attitude issues on top of being generic as fuck. I don't think you can generate that much hate by being just generic. "

Their first album isn't amazing or anything, in fact it's just ok, but it's way better than people give it credit for. They don't deserve to be put in the ranks of Blood on the Dancefloor or Brokencyde. "

Knives and Pens, Perfect Weapon, Children Surrender, and Heaven's Calling are pretty good. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","Agreed. I don't like them, but at least their guitarists actually know what they're doing. As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather listen to songs with actual leads and solos than incessant breakdowns and four chord choruses. You can say what you want about them, but their instrumentalists are objectively more talented than a lot of big names in the scene, like Memphis May Fire, Asking Alexandria, A Day to Remember, Of Mice and Men, etc. I will agree that Andy Biersack is a total douche, and can't sing for shit, though."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","&gt; As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather listen to songs with actual leads and solos than incessant breakdowns and four chord choruses. 

Give me a good riff and a catchy chorus and I'm good. But I would definitely take them over half the shit out there. There's plenty of stuff that's way better though. So it's not something I'll be listening to often. Not when I've got Killswitch, Haste the Day, Darkest Hour, Johnny Truant, The Agony Scene, Still Remains, Shadows Fall, As I Lay Dying, The Human Abstract, Becoming the Archetype, Demon Hunter, Living Sacrifice, Between the Buried and Me, Parkway Drive, The Showdown, The Sorrow, War of Ages, Destroy the Runner, Avenged Sevenfold, Sacred Mother Tongue, and surely plenty more. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","The majority of the bands you listed are kick ass! You're right, BVB are nothing special that I would willingly listen to, but it's hard to lump them with BOTDF and SWS when they have more talent than the majority of the genericore bands in the scene "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","&gt;BVB are nothing special that I would willingly listen to, but it's hard to lump them with BOTDF and SWS

I don't think you're giving SWS enough credit either. They're nothing special themselves, but they aren't painful to listen to like Blood on the Dancefloor. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","I just can't help but see their 'band look' and want to vomit. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","Yeah. It's kind of cringy. But to be fair, you'd probably be saying that about KISS if you were around in their day.

Or maybe you feel that way about KISS now. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","I do feel a bit like that about KISS, but they had the benefit of at least being original. It probably was provocative and mysterious at the time, but you just cant blatantly rip off the look 40 years after it was cool IMO. 
"
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","I will also admit I'm a bit idealistic when it comes to bands, for example I can't listen to As I Lay Dying without thinking 'this is great but the singer tried to kill his wife...' and feeling like it spoils the effect a bit. 

On the other hand, when I discovered Trivium and realised I liked everything about them, from their look to their style to their personalities, I was in love."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","I'm quite the opposite. Short of the band personally dong something awful to me or my family, nothing would keep me from listening to them if I liked the music. 

I don't care what they look like, act like, or believe."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","&gt;I do feel a bit like that about KISS, but they had the benefit of at least being original.

As stupid as I think the look is, you're right. They at least were original. And were shocking back then. It just looks silly now though. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","To be fair: A phrase that often precedes a statement that is intended to offer a piece of information which the speaker feels is important to the conversation. This phrase often sounds pretentious when used, and will often be followed by a piece of obvious information that nobody wants to hear."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","To be fair, I didn't know this. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","Brokencyde at least did something different. BVB has some cringeworthy generic moments mixed with just plain awful vocals."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","&gt;Brokencyde at least did something different.

So did Design the Skyline. Different =/= good. 

 &gt; BVB has some cringeworthy generic moments mixed with just plain awful vocals.

Their vocals aren't that awful. They're a million times better than Blood on the Dancefloor. I'm not saying they're a top tier band by any means. But they're easily a tier or two above horrid crunkcore. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","You can't give brokenCYDE praise and hate on BVB, Wut. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","Well, Brokencyde had [one song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbg6lwq5yS4) I actually liked. Can't say the same about BVB lol


But yeah they are a few steps above Brokencyde musically, but I personally think they kinda deserve the hate they get."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","BVB has one song that I actually really enjoyed, I still get chills every time I listen to it, [In the End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWsJAsQ-RwA) the music video is pretty cringy so I'm just going to send the lyric video."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","I agree with this. In The End is a pretty fuck ing good song, but the rest is very meh. Not bad, just meh."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","dude you have to be trolling by claiming that song to be more enjoyable than BVB's entire body of work"
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","To be fair I'd much rather listen to Brokencyde than BVB anyday. At least I can get a laugh out of Brokencyde and it's somewhat musically interesting. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","I'm with ya man. For as much as I hate ""crunk poser metal white boy gangstacore"" I hate hair metal more. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","Omam. They can't make the same album over abd over."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","But they CAN make better music, which is what they are neglecting to do."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","In your opinion "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","It's a widespread opinion."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","I don't see it a whole lot in this thread, but ETF.

Their latest album is definitely better than anything else they've done (Craig-era)"
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","For me it's Motionless In White, yeah they're dressing all dark and spooky, no they don't sound exactly like Manson, 
Issues, Tyler Carter has a great voice, while Michael Bonn's isn't exceptional, it's still quite strong, they're doing something new and making fun songs."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","Verb The Noun
"
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","Fuck Verb The Noun, bet they got signed before even having a band practice."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","Of Mice &amp; Men. Sure, they've changed their sound. From a metalcore perspective, they've changed for the worse. But they're on the verge of a mainstream breakthrough. They've toured with Linkin Park for crying out loud. 

At the end of the day, music is a business and these guys are in it to make money. I can never fault them for ""selling out"". Who would you rather be - a talented, yet relatively unknown and poor band (Oh, Sleeper, Erra, Breakdown of Sanity, etc.) or a sellout making a comfortable living? I'm taking option B. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","I see what you are saying and agree with you to an extent, but when you begin to make music for the sole sake of selling records just to make money because that's what is popular it's no longer an art form. It's simply a path to a pay check. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","Maybe, just maybe, they got bored playing open string breakdowns and wanted to play ThreeDaysGracecore. Anyway I think they are still playing music they like."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","[deleted]"
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","DAE le epic life saved joke"
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","I think when a band gets extremely shitty sounding, they deserve the hate they receive. Even if they're getting a lot of money for being shitty sounding."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","That's totally subjective. Therefor every band ever is totally deserving of hate because someone thinks they sound like shit."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","Ya I agree with that."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","I agree with Of Mice &amp; Men but IMO it's just that they're not that much worse than they used to be. To me Restoring Force doesn't seem to be very far off The Flood musically; they're both OK but nothing special."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","It's several miles off the flood."
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","yeah, I don't get why people think that. the distance between RF and The Flood is tiny compared to the distance between The Flood and a really good metalcore album"
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","Nah man, what I was meaning to say was that RF was straight shit with like 3 good songs. The flood didn't have a bad song on it, in fact I consider it to be OM&amp;Ms best album. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","Emmure: The 0000 jokes are old, not funny and most of the time wrong, stop it. They have their own sound, and Speaker of the Dead, despite it's faults (aliens and fellatio watching), is a metalcore/deathcore landmark.


Limp Bizkit: They did something different and super fun back then and made rock mainstream again. Can't wait for the new album, Ready to Go was a good jam (if you exclude that Lil Wayne part).


BMTH: I mean c'mon, people are still mad that Oli gets a lot of fangirls? pffft


Black Tongue: Yes there's a lot of breakdowns, yes they tune their guitars and bass really low and yes they play slow. That's how they want to sound, no one really played that kind of slowed pace/doomy deathcore so well before.

"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","That they made [something new and fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTMVOzPPtiw). I was to busy watching pokemon back in 1998/99 to pay attention if rock was really mainstream.  "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","1) I'm shocked people hate Black Tongue and then go on to like Attila and Emmure

2) Again, they took what Deftones were doing and made it more sellable. I'm not sure if that makes it 'new' "

"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","No I imagine not liking is acknowledging they exist within the medium and not enjoying their music. Hating would be gong as far to bash the band and have a stronger anger towards them."

I can think of a few deathcore bands i feel that way about, but Black Tongue  isn't one of them. Even among the tune it low play it slow stuff. If I was forced to listen to that style of music, I might listen to them. "
"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","Black Tongue is the only slow chugga chugga choo choo bands I listen to. After a while it can get cumbersome. I prefer the fast weedley dees of Rings of Saturn."

"Bands who get an unfair amount of hate?","RoS is sweet, one of the few deathcore bands that really amazes me.

There are bands innovating the future of Metalcore and as much as I like seeing the great, I would love to see the soon to be great. 

And as everyone hates this topic, I dont care if it gets downvoted to oblivion, You would just be furthering my point. Plus if i see that same post about Issues, Beartooth, Architects and BMTH.. I will just laugh at the broken record you are playing on this subreddit.

Yeah, you're always gonna have the constantly upvoted, popular bands. If they're the mainstays of the genre, they're gonna be posted in the genre's sub, so I wouldn't complain about that: it's inevitable.

"IN HEARTS WAKE - Earthwalker // Lyric Video","Don't know why you got downvoted...I think the production is just different. Divination was gritty and agressive. This was more polished and clean Different sounds, but I enjoyed Divination more.

Edit: In addition, I think the guitar work reflects this perfectly. The chug patterns/riffs in Divination are way more technical, aggressive and djent-y. As a guitar player, I hear some of the patterns on that album and I'm like ""Nopeee"" but on Earthwalker, they're similar (for the most part) and not as djent-y. I'm not as scared to try and play along with those songs. Also the tone on them is cleaner, making the leads more prominent. So instead of this crushing your skull in feel driven by heavy riffs and chugs, you get this more dreamy/atmospheric feel led by leads and synthy stuff.  "
"IN HEARTS WAKE - Earthwalker // Lyric Video","You nailed it.  

With Divination, IHW were a young, unsigned band.  I wanted to capture that raw energy and live sound.  With Earthwalker/Skydancer, I wanted the production to reflect their maturity as individuals and songwriters.  If you go back and watch the old videos, they're produced the same way.  Wait until you see ""Breakaway""... some of the highest production you'll ever see in a metalcore video."

"Having trouble finding new bands to listen to?","Hey everyone, I've had trouble lately trying to find new bands that sound similar to the stuff I listen to. I know there is a list in the sidebar but I'm looking for a little bit of a different answer. The bands I listen to are pretty mainstream, and I was looking to find more underground stuff that is similar. I listen to bands like Periphery, Crown The Empire, Northlane, Issues, TDWP, BMTH, Amity. I don't know if these bands are a separate genre from typical metalcore but I like a nice balanced mix of cleans and uncleans. I'm not really a fan of those deep throaty growls the entire song. Are these bands considered metalcore and if so what would you guys recommend for me to take a listen to based on what I like? Periphery is one of my favorites so far, I love the uniqueness they bring to the table, although I haven't been able to find many bands like them. "
"Having trouble finding new bands to listen to?","I'd recommend Erra if you haven't heard them before"
"Having trouble finding new bands to listen to?","I've heard of them, I dig them as well. Some songs are a little too heavy for me, but definitely a unique sounding band. Thanks for the recommendation."
"Having trouble finding new bands to listen to?","Ah, fair enough"
"Having trouble finding new bands to listen to?","I have similar taste as you. 

Try out some [Bury Tomorrow](http://youtu.be/PsEHYaphdJY) and [This or the Apocalypse](http://youtu.be/8kD3qQ01crg).

I'm into post-hardcore but have gotten more into the metalcore genre as of late, or at least some of the mainstream stuff. I know all of the other bands you listed but thank you still! 

Go ahead and suggest more. Just more for me to add to my driving playlist. "

"Having trouble finding new bands to listen to?","[Found these guys not too long ago, Currents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHvHtiDAy5w)
Dont think they do any cleans, but there is a bit of range in the vocals

[If I Were You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJQgR-DqOmw)
Pretty decent mix in cleans and uncleans, some range as well

[Alexis in Texas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kcEGXV_-U4&amp;index=26&amp;list=PLu0thtA5wmq8Kg8lNI1scPOj6gwwdmfN5)
Autotuned cleans, but some nice uncleans

[A Thing About Machines(has growls for most of the song though)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJgFlSmz7fk&amp;index=28&amp;list=PLu0thtA5wmq8Kg8lNI1scPOj6gwwdmfN5)

Cleans in some songs, a lot of range in the vocals. Also very progressive (Think thats the word)

[I Capture Castle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miTi2Eb08Og)
Tyler Carter cleans

[Johari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npSbkL9nJAI)

Hope this helps a bit :D"
"Having trouble finding new bands to listen to?","See oddly enough that band Currents was really good to me, even though there weren't any cleans it felt good to understand what he was saying. Definitely a good listen and a Periphery vibe to them, will be playing that EP some more. 

If I Were You, very good as well! Also a little bit of a CTE sound to them, such a deep find with only 1000 views. A Thing About Machines was a really good band as well, interesting how they put some synth in there it really ties the song together.

Oceans Ate Alaska is a really good new and upcoming band as well, I've just recently listened to them, love the different sound from a lot of the other stuff that is out there. 

I Capture Castle was really good, I'm a sucker for Tyler Carter. 

Johari was actually one of my favorites, they sound really good! Thanks for all of these bands, I know it probably took some time :D I appreciate it! "
"Having trouble finding new bands to listen to?","No problem! I found most of those bands on spotify discover mode and what not.

"Has anyone gone to a concert and sat at the bleachers/stands?","I'm trying to see Issues with my buddy and have two opportunities.  The 2nd could definitely be the floor the first one is on some bleachers.  I kind of want to rock out and jump around but the 1st show is in the bleachers and I feel like I wouldn't enjoy that show too much.  Have any of you guys have?  And how was the experience?"
"Has anyone gone to a concert and sat at the bleachers/stands?","I went to Mahem over the summer and sat in the bleachers. The bands wanted us to stand up anyways which felt pretty wierd. I would recommend being in the crowd it's much more fun rather than just sitting in the back listening."
"Has anyone gone to a concert and sat at the bleachers/stands?","I always feel awkward sitting/standing in a seated area at shows. I went to see Rush a couple years ago, and I just wanted to move. Always get in the pit, especially for a band like Issues. You don't want to be hearing ""Stingray Affliction"" kick in and not be able to just thrash your body around uncontrollably.  "
"Has anyone gone to a concert and sat at the bleachers/stands?","I was in the bleachers at the Air Canada Centre for Rise Against/A Day To Remember.  It kinda sucked.  Always get in the pit when you can.  It might be more expensive but youll have a much better time.  "
"Has anyone gone to a concert and sat at the bleachers/stands?","I've actually seen that combination twice- once in bleachers, and once on the floor. Being on the floor is almost always more fun."
"Has anyone gone to a concert and sat at the bleachers/stands?","I won the opportunity to see SwS/PtV on their world tour through a local radio station recently. I entered the contest for shits and gigs, I enjoy a few of the band's songs so I figured ""why not, can't hurt."" Ended up winning so I took my girlfriend with me. We sat up on the balcony for the first three acts, Mallory Knox, PVRIS and Pierce the Veil then went down on the floor for SwS. This was the only time I have *ever* sat at a show, especially a rock concert. I can say in complete confidence, that even in the sea of fan girls, it was more fun watching from the floor and being somewhat involved in the show than it was simply spectating from above. 

Bottom line, I have to be on the floor/""pit"" level at any form of rock show, regardless of how big of a fan I am of who's playing."
"Has anyone gone to a concert and sat at the bleachers/stands?","they're two different experiences. Sitting in the bleachers is a more relaxed show, because you don't get pushed around or anything, but being on the floor is definitely more personal because you get to be more social and the band is right in front of you. I saw Linkin Park from the back of Madison Square Garden and I don't regret it, but I also saw Rise Against on the floor of a stadium which was amazing because of how huge it is."
"Has anyone gone to a concert and sat at the bleachers/stands?","yeah the tragically hip but a metal or hardcore show? fuck no"
"Has anyone gone to a concert and sat at the bleachers/stands?","I went and saw ABR, MMI, Northlane, FFAK, and Erra on Saturday. I spent 100% of the show in the bar area sitting at a table. I had a great view of the stage and I loved it. I normally spend the whole time getting sweaty in the pit, but I blew out my knee this year skiing so i figured i better play it safe. I was surprised how much more i enjoyed the show being able to actually see everything as apposed to being in the pit. plus i could drink beer the whole time. 

this wont work at every venue though.  "
"Has anyone gone to a concert and sat at the bleachers/stands?","I exclusively stand back and just enjoy the show now when I go to concerts regardless to the venue. I'm just not a fan of being thrashed around anymore. I'll go in the crowd if it's a band I've been waiting years to see or am a giant fan of but other than that I just enjoy it. Really, it's not a bad experience at all. "

Unfortunately, I have run out of ideas as to what to listen to. So, give me what you've been listening to lately. Preferably smaller bands since I've also listened to the major bands in the genre many times. It also doesn't have to be exclusively metalcore, I'm open to all -core genre recommendations.

Feed Her To The Sharks - Fortitude, just got put on there and it's sick.  
Affiance - Blackout, normally don't like clean vocals much at all but he's sick.  
Heaven Shall Burn - VETO, not strictly metalcore more melo-deathy but cool as fuck.  
Ne Obliviscaris - Citadel, I can't stand progressive metal, but these guys are a progressive death metal outfit that absolutely kill the genre, amazing instruments and songs that feel like stories.  
Hundredth - When Will We Surrender, classic core shit.  
Jamie's Elsewhere - Rebel-Revive, sort of soft metalcore kind of stuff, I like it a fair bit.  
A Plea For Purging - The Marriage Of Heaven And Hell, basic deathcore stuff, the album art is what got me.

I'm currently jamming a lot of old Escape the Fate because I'm pretty hyped for the new Falling In Reverse record. 

Just got to see Sleeping With Sirens and Pierce the Veil for free the other day and my attention was really caught by the British rockers Mallory Knox who opened the show. Great alt. rock stuff with a post-hardcore-ish flair. Two really solid albums from those dudes. 

New Enter Shikari album is really badass.

New Periphery double album is even more badass. Thats the only thing I've had in my truck since its release.

[Stolas - Allomaternal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrzrHhmOSW4): Clean vocalist sounds a bit weird at times, but it has some really epic moments. Proving Grounds and Solunar are my favorite tracks so far. Been listening to this album on repeat the past few days.

[Hail The Sun - Wake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i45pYq-58po): Their clean and unclean vocalist is their drummer and he is an amazing drummer in his own right. I listened to this album like 50 times in a few days last week, so it holds for me.

[Narco Debut - Self Titled](https://narcodebut.bandcamp.com/album/narco-debut): Local band from Detroit that's insanely good. Not very angry, but amazing nonetheless. No offense to -core music, but these guys write something that feels like actual real music with melodies and stuff. Really good.

[Periphery - Alpha/Omega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDDZyf3qzVw&amp;list=PLH22-xSMERQp9Jq_FLpgQ57BHZEm132Nz): It's an amazing experience to listen to these back to back. Look me about ten playthroughs to learn to enjoy fully because it can kind of be a mess of shit at first.

[Enter Shikari - The Mindsweep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHSHhs3ynSo&amp;list=PLKAm0swRNcks6uvDF2MdqO9NIuXP0uy5_): Environmentalcore. For real, a very creative album, I love it and respect Enter Shikari so much.

[From Indian Lakes - Able Bodies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-H6l511ofU&amp;list=PLpdMiFSvzwgmeqeb7yBVKUMhRF-cjq-lJ): Not angry at all, but an absolutely amazing band. Seriously, if anyone is reading this, take the time to listen to this album. If it's not for you, that's fine, but everyone I've played this album to has fallen in love with it. These guys are absolutely phenomenal. They have a dedicated tambourinist and organist to add to the atmosphere."

"Where does /r/metalcore (or really any kind of rock) get updates about music/ album releases?","correct answer. I have about 20 different bands on Facebook that I've set to get notifications whenever they post something. Usually it's boring stuff like tour announcements that won't be hitting my hometown or photos of the band's drummer like ""hey i'm pissing in this plant lol!!!"" or whatever but sometimes it works out really well, like yesterday when i got home from work to find DGD's new song waiting for me."

Fuck genres, it's good music. Oh and nice flair."
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - Prancer","Thanks man. Yeah... the genre is really ""noisecore"" but it overlaps with the likes of ""mathcore"" and ""grindcore."" I try not to get too hung up on genres either, but it is a handy way of finding similar music and if someone were to like Dillinger and then look for similar ""Metalcore"" bands, they'll be severely disappointed to find that metalcore is really just emo/pop punk music with hardcore influences. "
"The Dillinger Escape Plan - Prancer","You can have that attitude, or you can see them as the kings of metalcore with other greats like Converge, Botch, Cult leader etc

Though I don't think I would call any Dillinger song grindcore, at times noisecore, always mathcore but mathcore is pretty much a subgenre of metalcore.

And the state of metalcore today is pretty bad.

Oh and nice flair.

Edit : I forgot I changed my flair to Botch, but still all the same"

I bought this oil on canvas a while ago at a charity shop. Really liked the thickness of the paint and uneasy feel. Later I noticed it was signed Bannon and tried to see if I could figure out the artist. I thought maybe it was by Jacob Bannon, perhaps something he did in school or later. I think his wiki stated that he sold paintings to pay bills. I've always wondered and was hoping someone here may be familiar with his earlier work.

"Anti-suicide songs?","Yes!  I was hoping someone would say Amity Affliction.  I think their best anti-suicide song is Don't Lean On Me, but that's just my opinion.

"Guitar players! I have a question!","tube screamer plus a pedal called ""metal core"" will pretty much give you the sound you want. you'll also want to have at least one noise gate/suppressor. Pick up a few patch cables and you're set."
"Guitar players! I have a question!","Metal Zone and Metal Core pedals sound the same, but the extra tone controls on the Metal Zone pedal can really change the sound. MZ is much better."

"What bands do you think are ruined by the vocals?","I just think a lot of bands are ruined by throwing in the clean choruses. I hate when I'm listening to a song that's nice and heavy in the beginning and then comes in the clean chorus that has been overused and really just deflates the hype of the song."

"What bands do you think are ruined by the vocals?","Not really metalcore, but [Shokran] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frPjgQY6p8I) are pretty progressive and I just cant stand the cleans and sometimes not even the screams, so Im glad there is this [instrumental version] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3Xd6SWFCs) of it :)"

"What bands do you think are ruined by the vocals?","Agreed. "
"What bands do you think are ruined by the vocals?","I kinda like the cleans, although I feel like they should have more songs without cleans. "
"What bands do you think are ruined by the vocals?","Agreed. Their first album was great with just slight cleans. New album was the opposite."

"What bands do you think are ruined by the vocals?","Periphery. I think, instrumentally, they are some of the most talented guys out there. But for some reason I just can't get into Spencer's vocals. I only recently discovered the instrumental version of their first album, and I gotta say that I'm in love. I just don't think Spencer really fits the style they're aiming for well."
"What bands do you think are ruined by the vocals?","Have you ever heard their song Froggin' Bullfish? Give it a listen, I think it does a really good job of showcasing all of Spencer's vocals.

And for no specific band but if they use heaps of pig squeals or even lots of growls I just don't enjoy it. A bit of growls every now and then is good but that's it for me"

"What bands do you think are ruined by the vocals?","I don't really understand why Kyle get's so much flak, I think most of his cleans are really fitting. I mean sometimes his voice isn't really good for the dynamic of a song such as Sacred. But not to the point of ruining the song.

"
"What bands do you think are ruined by the vocals?","His singing is good don't get me wrong, but the songs make you go mad and then the cleans come in and it just doesn't fit. I don't know if it's the pitch or if clean singing just doesn't fit the type of music the play. Only time it works for me is in Wildflower."
"What bands do you think are ruined by the vocals?","I find this/your name ironic, because until recently Jeremy from TDWP fits that description. "
"What bands do you think are ruined by the vocals?","That irony is lost to me then. Yes, my account is named after a TDWP song. No i don't claim to be a fan or even like them because of that.

I agree that Jeremy fits that description and it sounds awful in most songs. However he transitioned into a more natural sound with the last 2 records which i quite like. 

Of course that's just my opinion."

"Surprise Nostalgia...","Was browsing through some old music i found on my laptop and rediscovered my love for the Underoath album They're Only Chasing Safety. It has been so long since i have listened to it, and the album is SO good. Anyone else ""rediscover"" and album lately? 

Edit: For the grammar Nazis"
"Surprise Nostalgia...","All the fucking time, man. I'm just now listening to ""The Distance Between Hell and Home"" by Counterparts for the first time in months. Also ""Discovering The Waterfront"" ny Silverstein.

It's both not Metalcore but idgaf. These albums are golden."
"Surprise Nostalgia...","Fuck The distance between hell and home is an absolutely incredible album, not a boring song imo."
"Surprise Nostalgia...","Love me some silverstein "
"Surprise Nostalgia...","Not metalcore, but Daath's album The Concealers. I had a few tracks from it (and The Hinderers) on my zune back in high school. [Day of Endless Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn_aQwQUs2M) and [Sharpen the Blades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVzwRZbgsUk) are amazing. "
"Surprise Nostalgia...","Daath is awesome! The opening riff of Day of Endless Light always reminded me of Master's Apprentices by Opeth."
"Surprise Nostalgia...","I listened to the entirety of the fall of ideals last week. That album is just so damn good."
"Surprise Nostalgia...","It's Dangerous Business is amazing. I first heard it at a club at Uni and thought it was awesome."
"Surprise Nostalgia...","I just ""rediscovered"" Daybreaker by Architects, I'd been listening to Lost Forever//Lost Together so much that I'd forgotten how good Daybreaker was"
"Surprise Nostalgia...","Just rediscovered A Wolf. A Liar. "
"Surprise Nostalgia...","They're* and an*, also that album is post-hardcore but I digress.

I just jammed Your Demise's The Kids We Used To Be obsessively over the past week. That was and still is my fucking jam.

EDIT: Lol downvotes for answering the question. Did my corrections of errant grammar warrant these? Ya'll are funny."
"Surprise Nostalgia...","Not sure what your more picky with grammar, or sub genre's."
"Surprise Nostalgia...","I'm picky with grammar because I'm studying to be an English teacher and because it's not difficult to follow simple conventions of the language, and I'm picky with genres because there's a reason the subreddit is called ""metalcore"". I didn't say that the topic should be removed because Underoath is primarily a metalcore band. That album just happens to be post-hardcore."
"Surprise Nostalgia...","I understand that English grammar is very simple, but not everybody who uses reddit is English. Also all these sub genres aren't simple at all and to someone like me who knows nothing about music, they all sound the same."
"Surprise Nostalgia...","If English is not OP's native language, then I'm very sorry for that. But based on the context clues of the rest of the post, intuition would lead me to suspect that English is indeed OP's native language. And understanding the genres is rather simple, and it has been explained to death. Even then, the fact that They're Only Chasing Safety is a post-hardcore album by a metalcore band doesn't mean the topic should get removed, which I said."

Why couldn't they just stream them for free on YouTube, or even make them available for purchase by themselves? Oh yeah, because more album sales. I don't blame them, money is nice."

"Architects' to release deluxe edition of Lost Forever // Lost Together on March 27th featuring two new tracks; ""The Shadow of Doubt"" and ""Untitled II"".","Architects are a solid band but fuck Epitaph for forcing people to presumably pay twice for an album just to get two new songs. If they wanted to be cool about it they should have some way to get the new songs for less, or free, with proof of purchase of the original version. They must know people are going to pirate it anyway."
"Architects' to release deluxe edition of Lost Forever // Lost Together on March 27th featuring two new tracks; ""The Shadow of Doubt"" and ""Untitled II"".","To be fair, they're not forcing you. I bought the album, but I'm fucked if I'm gonna spend £12 again just for two songs, I'll just get them online, the same as I'm sure a large majority will. Bands complain about people downloading their music, but then sign with labels that try and double dip their fans, doesn't make sense to me."
"Architects' to release deluxe edition of Lost Forever // Lost Together on March 27th featuring two new tracks; ""The Shadow of Doubt"" and ""Untitled II"".","Back when I used to pre-order albums I got so upset about this.  Used to."
"Architects' to release deluxe edition of Lost Forever // Lost Together on March 27th featuring two new tracks; ""The Shadow of Doubt"" and ""Untitled II"".","Or it's *warranted* incentive for newer fans to purchase a copy. Architects are *still* touring and promoting this material (and this act itself isn't the placeholder it's become to keep a band relevant during break/recording .

I became a fan of Architects in the middle of the Daybreaker cycle. I was ready to buy the original version and, boom, they announced the deluxe version - allowing me to get the grandest version of the album possible.

Just have to look at it from a different angle, *especially* in Architects' case -considering that LF/LT was an acclaimed. hit, the band's highest selling record yet and they just got done supporting ETID and TGI (and IKTPQ tour in Australia's case).


Sometimes-necessary evil.

Edit: And it's not even Epitaph, it's UNFD. Rise just partnered with them. This is just the band trying to reach a wider audience. This is the Northlane thing but backwards."
"Architects' to release deluxe edition of Lost Forever // Lost Together on March 27th featuring two new tracks; ""The Shadow of Doubt"" and ""Untitled II"".","They're not even new songs. If you look on Wikipedia, they were Australian bonus tracks."

"Architects' to release deluxe edition of Lost Forever // Lost Together on March 27th featuring two new tracks; ""The Shadow of Doubt"" and ""Untitled II"".","Because the deluxe edition hasn't been released yet. Wikipedia isn't always reliable. "
"Architects' to release deluxe edition of Lost Forever // Lost Together on March 27th featuring two new tracks; ""The Shadow of Doubt"" and ""Untitled II"".","No they weren't, we received the exact same songs as everyone else in the world when it was released last year. The deluxe is being released exclusively in Australia, but we haven't gotten the tracks yet. The ""bonus tracks"" thing would be referring to the deluxe edition that has yet to be released. "
"Architects' to release deluxe edition of Lost Forever // Lost Together on March 27th featuring two new tracks; ""The Shadow of Doubt"" and ""Untitled II"".","Weird. I looked on Wikipedia about a week ago and it was already there and who knows when they added it."
"Architects' to release deluxe edition of Lost Forever // Lost Together on March 27th featuring two new tracks; ""The Shadow of Doubt"" and ""Untitled II"".","Well they announced the deluxe edition of the album over a month ago, I dunno why it's only now getting publicity. "

"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I loved both. I don't quite understand how people could dislike either, they're both so good. "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Miss May I is a great example. It's not like the general trend is worse, I personally believe every album is worse than its predecessor, black in white. I do feel though that their next album would be a change and be on par with Monument. A guitarist in another band told me that apparently Levi wasn't happy at all with Rise of the Lion, and I feel like them releasing it and listening to it over a couple years will be enough to push them away from it. Hell, they're already dropping Rise of the Lion songs off their setlist (they're down to 25% now)."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Who was it that told you that?"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","One of the guys in Affiance. I don't want to be any more specific than that."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","That's fine. Makes sense too, RotL is absolutely horrible."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","It had a few redeeming riffs and Jerod hasn't yet shit the bed (though he's still not as good as he was on Apologies), but there were a lot of boring parts on the album and Levi just sounds like a frog... I don't know how that happens after having a good album vocal performance, a decent one, and an ok one. I actually just listened to that album again (I like to listen to the discography of a band again after I've seen them recently)"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I could surely agree with AA between R&amp;R and FDTD but suas and R&amp;R are great albums I could definetly see the new album being about as good as them."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse: Of Mice &amp; Men

Better: Ice Nine Kills"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","OMAM? I thought Restoring Force was amazing."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Not sure if serious. "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I am"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Color me shocked people actually liked RF

In all seriousness, it's a good album if you consider the fact that they're no longer metalcore."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Well that's the thing, really. I'm not genre-specific with the music I like, so sure it's not what we're used to with OMAM but I personally thought it was amazing."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","BLASPHEMY"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","well you're wrong"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse - Asking Alexandria. 

Better - I See Stars. "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I See Stars is a perfect example. 3D was an incredible release and then End of the World Party was just...ugh. But since then they've slowly but surely been getting better and better."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse: The Amity Affliction, Bullet for My Valentine, Miss May I. After the Burial, The Color Morale, The Word Alive

Better: Breakdown of Sanity, Bring Me the Horizon, Bury Tomorrow, Confession, Ice Nine Kills, I Killed the Prom Queen, I the Breather, Oh Sleeper, Wolves at the Gate"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I sorta disagree with ATB. Yeah In Dreams wasn't as groovy and shreddy as Rareform, but it's a really melodic album, which I love. And Wolves Within was a great combination of both of the two and imo is on par with Rareform. FAFF damn good too, but pretty different compared to the rest. "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","yea, I'm not saying they're bad by any means, just think each album wasn't as good as the one before it, and I liked Wolves Within just thought it was a little too chuggy at times"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Of the bands I listen to, I agree. With one exception: Bury Tomorrow.

Runes is a great album and has some jams (Man on Fire, The Torch), but it doesn't quite top The Union of Crowns for me. The latter just feels like more of a cohesive and consistent album. Portraits was also good, but I'll concede that both of their following albums are better."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse: Asking Alexandria, Miss May I, All That Remains, Memphis May Fire, OM&amp;M

Better: BMTH, TDWP, August Burns Red, Architects"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I agree with most of that.  I'd say that BMTH got progressively different, not better.  

They kicked ass at deathcore, and they are pretty good at....  whatever it is you'd call what they do now."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Its actually sad that i agree with you on Miss May I. i loved Relentless Chaos and then after that i could really listen :("
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I agree completely although i never liked Miss may i they sounded horrible both times i saw them and this was before i heard a single song from them on top of that the singer cant sing whats so fucking ever."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I think the singer is *okay*, he's not amazing but there are some much worse singers out there."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worst: Billy Talent

Best : I can't think of any, if I like the band I will almost love every release by them
"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","What'd you think of Billy Talent's new single 'Kingdom Of Zod' a few months back?

I think they've definitely gotten a slightly more mainstream sound and haven't changed their style too much with every release, but every release has sounded more refined to me than the last and I love all of them.

Obviously, it's cool if you're not a fan, but just wondering what your perspective is."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I actually enjoyed kingdom of zod a lot, a catchy chorus. To tell you the truth the reason why I thought they had got worse was because i was obsessed with them  and just loved the first two albums. Live they were good!"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","What..? Every single thing BT has ever put out has been amazing. Dead Silence wasn't as good as their first 3 albums, but I don't think it was *that* much worse that you needed to include them in this. Kingdom of Zod is a sweet track, too."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse: MMI, MMF, AA, The Color Morale, Bullet For My Valentine (heres hoping that changes), As I Lay Dying^^^I'msorry

Better: Blessthefall (though theyve always been amazing, theyre just more amazing), I See Stars, BMTH, Fit for a King"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse: Of Mice &amp; Men
Better: I See Stars

Absolutely most consistently perfect band in the world: Silverstein."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse: Of Mice &amp; Men, The Acacia Strain, Avenged Sevenfold (they got better until they peaked with City of Evil), Bullet for My Valentine, The Devil Wears Prada, Miss May I, Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, In Flames (I don't like anything they put out after Colony), The Showdown, A Skylit Drive

Better: Protest the Hero, As I Lay Dying, Black Veil Brides, Bring Me the Horizon, Misery Signals, Chelsea Grin, Rings of Saturn

Consistent: Killswitch Engage, August Burns Red, Carnifex, blessthefall, Every Time I Die, Haste the Day, Parkway Drive, "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I am going to respectfully disagree with you opinion on Prada. 8:18 is a masterpiece. 

However, I very very agree with Protest the Hero. "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I like 8:18 but hated the vocals on it. I would say that they have been getting better with each release but With Roots Above is by far my favorite and Plagues is second, just since I've listened to them so much. With Roots Above is actually probably my favorite album ever."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I wasn't big on 8:18. Too much focus on the synths and not enough on the guitars for me. But it is a step up from Dead Throne and there are a couple tracks I really like. 

"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Downvoted for your opinion, as usual. I love 8:18 to death but there's nothing wrong with not liking it. "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Totally disagree with Chelsea Grin getting better. I liked Ashes to Ashes a lot, but i don't think it's anywhere near as good as My Damnation or the self titled."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Musically ashes was amazing but Alex and his lyrics..."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Yeahhhhh"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","It wasn't much of a step up from My Damnation imo. Both are great."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Hit the nail on the head with TDWP"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I always thought protest the hero was consistent with their music, scurrilous was the only album i didn't like and kezia i still think is their best album."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","They've been consistently great no doubt. but I would say they've gone from being a 4/ 5 on Kezia to a 5/5 on everything since. Part of why Kezia strikes me as their weakest, is the fact that it seems the least Protest of their albums. It doesn't really have the crazy, proggy, wank that their other three have. It's actually closer to something Avenged Sevenfold might have put out in their metalcore days, not that that's a bad thing.  Also I think the transitions into the piano/acoustic segments and the production are shoddy. 

&gt;scurrilous was the only album i didn't like

Really? Scurrilous is my favorite, with tracks like Dunsel, Tapestry, Termites and C'est la Vie."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","The piano and acoustic was part of the reason i love kezia it reminds me alot of between the buried and me. I mistated about scurrilous i like the album its just my least favorite of their stuff mostly because i only like a few of the songs off of it (C'est la vie is a amazing song) so thats the only reason i consider it a little lower."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","The segments themselves are fine (I especially the piano at the end of I think either No Stars Over Bethlehem or Divinity Within). It's just the transition to them I have a problem with. Compare the acoustic bits in Blindfolds Aside (I think that's the track, if not it's the one with the line about cigarettes) to Skies from their newest album Volition. "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Skies acoustics are amazing! I think the kezia transitions are great as well, but who knows i might just be fanboying about the album too much."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Maybe, maybe I'm remembering wrong. I recall there being a short gap in sound between them. "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I don't remember one, but now if i go back and listen ill probably notice the gap."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","There's definitely one in Divinity Within. "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","[deleted]"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I'll agree somewhat on SS, You Can't Stop Me was better than the last two.

"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I think mitch is fine, I just never liked the actual music they put out. But The Cleansing was at least listenable, compared to the next two. "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","[deleted]"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse: A Skylit Drive, Crown The Empire, FATS

Better: Attack Attack! (When they were still around)"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse: The Color Morale  
Better: Architects"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Better: Unearth.

I've got a list but I wanted to highlight this one. I feel like this band has gotten better with each release (with the exception of The March). They want from a terrible metalcore band, to a decent but relatively generic metalcore band, to an awesome thrashy metalcore band with shitty production, (to a slower boring metalcore band), to a very melodic, not outdated metalcore band, and finally to a gutsy hard-hitting metalcore band. One of the few metalcore bands who actually play more blast beats as they release new albums."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Watchers of Rule from last year is my mother fucking shit, nigga! "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","The Swarm was the first song I heard off of it (it was the single) and the beginning of it with the muted crashes and then the jump into trad blast beats just blew me away. If you listen to the average song off of The March and then listen to The Swarm, you really do respect the band."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse, then better: Falling In Reverse - because of their new album, lol.

"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Their new album isn't bad, it's far better than their last.  I see a lot of hate for Falling in Reverse lately but I bet most of them haven't listened through the album.  A few songs are misses but most of the album is pretty good.  "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Am I the only one that thinks that BMTH got worse and actually thought Count your blessings was their only good album?

maybe its because I am more of a deathcore than a metalcore fan"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse: Memphis May Fire
Better: Asking Alexandria"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse: Of Mice and Men and Asking Alexandria obviously, but I have a good feeling about AA upcoming album seems like it's gonna be breakdowncore like their first album

Beter: Attack Attack, letlive., Pierce The Veil, Bring Me The Horizon, I See Stars, Enter Shikari, Motionless in White, Blessthefall, Vanna

Consistent (good): A Day To Remember, Crown The Empire, August Burns Red, Every Time I Die, Dance Gavin Dance, Issues"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Kind of hard to say Issues is consistent considering they've only put out one EP and one album ( not including the acoustic album). I do hope they stay consistent with their next album and integrate Michaels harsh vocals just as much and if not more."
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse: Asking Alexandria, Beartooth, Of Mice &amp; Men

Better: The Color Morale, Bring Me the Horizon, Memphis May Fire, August Burns Red, the list goes on"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Better: Dillinger Escape Plan, Periphery, Within The Ruins

Worse: BMTH, Northlane, In Hearts Wake, Architects, After The Burial, Volumes, Betraying The Martyrs"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I don't know if you can say In Heart's Wake or Northlane got worse...they both put of superb debut albums and then followed up with fairly solid records (I actually like Singularity more than Discoveries, but to each their own). "
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","I'd have to say Dillinger have been extremely consistent in my opinion, every album was great but my favourite three are the first two and last one haha"
"What band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?","Worse: Sworn In (even though I've never really been a fan of any of their stuff), post-MDIYE The Color Morale, Beartooth

Better: August Burns Red, Blessthefall, The Chariot (before they broke up :(), Defeater, Erra, Fit For a King, letlive., Northlane, The Overseer, Wolves at the Gate"

"Question for the sub","Do you or have you ever found yourself falling out of the scene? Like i used to go to multiple concerts a month, keep up on all the latest news and listen to metalcore nonstop. But now i find myself becoming less interested, being out of the loop with all the news (for instance i just learned worsnop left AA) and at the last concert i went to (VIP passes to see the word alive) i just didnt have fun. Idk guys, i hate it because i love the scene but i feel less passionate about it. Has anyone else felt this way?"
"Question for the sub","For me, it seems like I've gotten more and more involved with it, though I've gotten way more picky about which bands I'm interested in"
"Question for the sub","I've never been able to go to shows bc I don't have a car or a reliable means of transportation, but I have noticed myself getting less interested in metalcore as I get older. Not to say I'm uninterested, but I've been focused more on post-hardcore, skramz, indie and the like."
"Question for the sub","It doesn't hurt to change it up. Keep things fresh. I find myself listening to a lot of softer/relax music... almost anything except metalcore, because when I go for runs or drive somewhere that's all I'm blasting. Then I go for periods where metalcore is *all* I listen to until I change it up again."
"Question for the sub","i think metalcore is mostly for teens/scene kids now, i don't listen to it as much as i used to. im more focused on hip hop/post hardcore."

Drakes new mixtape saved my fucking life"
"Question for the sub","i haven't given it much of a listen but i played a song or two and it was meh"
"Question for the sub","10 bands and star67 are probably my favorite (of the new tracks)
I would say 6 god and Used To but they were released before the mixtape so i wont include them

He's still dropping Views from the 6 next month too"
"Question for the sub","Know Yourself tho

I WAS RUNNING THROUGH THE SIX WITH MY WOES"
"Question for the sub","Yeah, I've definitely faded away from it. I mean, there are still bands in the genre I love, but I don't listen to as much as I used to. The majority of metalcore sounds the same to me, so I got bored with it. Lately I've been listening to a lot of grindcore and death metal, as well as rap, as well as some EDM. "
"Question for the sub","Feel the same way, i started branching out into just every genre as opposed to being dead set on one genre.

"Question for the sub","I guess...  sometimes I just don't feel like going to a show.  That's why I missed frozen flame."
"Question for the sub","There was a point where I didnt listen to this kind of music for around 3 months. I moved onto more death metal but found myself attracted to the clean vocals in metalcore. "
"Question for the sub","Depends a lot on the metalcore you like, I grew old of so much metalcore really quick but there is a few gems here that I just listen to non stop and I think that should be the case with most genres that you have a varied taste."
"Question for the sub","I'd say I have. About 50% or so. My favorite bands are releasing mediocre albums or ""selling out"" as some people might say. Now (for the most part), I'm listening to music 5 years ago, or dare I say it, brings something new to the table.  
  
But I kinda feel like it's a cycle. Maybe. We have shit [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eePvRdj5w_Y) which is the same shit I listened to in high school (10 years ago).  
  
I also used to go to every heavy show in town for 12 years. I just thought and haven't been to a show in over 6 months. I also used to buy albums constantly, but now I maybe find one interesting album a month now. Moreso smaller bands on bandcamp.    
  
I used to be the one that would say that there are subtle differences that gave bands their own sounds and identities. But now, with the 1000s of bands in the scene, I hate to say and feel that a lot of bands literally sound the same."
"Question for the sub","I've never really been ""part of the scene"" as I'm not the type to leave the house much. But I have been listening to less metalcore lately, in favor of melodic death metal and death metal.

"We need to stop yelling at Phil Labonte (All That Remains) and start talking to him.","No, this isn't how it works. Phil Labonte is a grown ass man with a really stupid opinion. How fucking dare this article say that the reaction to his comments is ""political correctness"" (which isn't even a real fucking thing, oh my god) when Phil literally said that gays don't go through the kind of horrors that blacks went through in the 1950s and therefore they don't have claim to feeling persecuted. Of course there aren't mass lynchings and organized attacks against gays, because we (thankfully) have progressed THAT far as a society in 60 years. But to say outright that gays are not facing persecution as a modern equivalent to what blacks went through is bullshit.

"How to avoid getting hurt at metalcore concerts?","Hey everyone, so I really need your advice... 

I'm a metalcore/post-hardcore music enthusiast girl who loves going to concerts. I went to a wild Parkway Drive show over the summer and got a pretty bad concussion from getting kicked hard in the head (on my left side) by a crowd surfer who snuck up on me from behind(I presume he had some enormous feet with some sort of heavy duty shoes on). I was watching Parkway Drive behind about 5 rows of people in the front, near the center of the floor at the time I got the concussion. I suffered tremendously from the post-concussive syndrome and finally seem to have recovered after ~6 months. After that incident, I've been trying to avoid live shows because I'm so afraid of getting a concussion again. I don't mind getting bruises and cuts from concerts (I actually love the wild, crazy metalcore concert scene), but I can't take any more chances with a blow to the head. 

Despite my acute fear, I couldn't resist but to get the tickets to go see Stick To Your Guns (with The Amity Affairs, In Hearts Wake, Being As An Ocean, and 68). STYG and TAA are amongst my favorite metalcore bands of all time, and I just couldn't afford to miss this show. They will be playing at a very small venue (with capacity of like 300-500). I've never seen a metalcore show at a tiny venue before so I don't know what to expect. I'll be going there with a good guy friend.

How can I avoid getting a concussion, while still being able to enjoy the show in a small venue?? I don't typically like the balconies because the crowd up there are kind of lame and boring. They don't have all the energy as the people on the floors (especially in the front). Please hit me up with some of your tips &amp; advices!!
"
"How to avoid getting hurt at metalcore concerts?","stand behind wherever the pit is.

front = you are going to have people crowdsurfing/kicking you in the face and stage-diving on your face in addition to people pushing you in the back constantly.

being near the pit in general = you are going to get karate kicked in the mouth by mouthbreathing hardcore ""dancers"".

so behind the pit or to the side of the pit (but not too close) is probably best for your situation."
"How to avoid getting hurt at metalcore concerts?","Yeah, /u/ManWithoutModem hit the nail on the head. You have far less of a chance of getting crowdkilled if you're behind wherever the pit is, because those kids generally don't move further from the stage. Best of luck to you."
"How to avoid getting hurt at metalcore concerts?","Wow man that fucking sucks i've been going to gigs for almost 10 years and (touch wood) have never taken a head injury. Hope all is well. I've never seen STYG or TAA but I shouldn't think the crowd would be any crazier than a PWD crowd. I agree with /u/ManWithoutModem, avoid the pit, it may be a good idea to go near the side of the crowd by the front of the barriers and keep an eye out, most crowdsurfers go to the middle and where I see bands they have bouncers up front who can get you seen to medically if you go over the barrier. We don't have stage divers too often here."
"How to avoid getting hurt at metalcore concerts?","Never been hit the head or just haven't had an injury? Probably half the shows I go to, I get hit someway or another in the head."
"How to avoid getting hurt at metalcore concerts?","[deleted]"
"How to avoid getting hurt at metalcore concerts?","I've been in pits in venues ranging from arenas (Metallica) to bars (Zao) and I've never come out without at least bruising.  Nearly had my glasses destroyed at a The Chairot show, and since then, I've stood in the back.  Being tall it's not as big a deal for me, but if you're shorter it might impact your experience.  If your friend can do some blocking for you, you might be able to stay a little closer at STYG, but I'd recommend hanging back a bit.  Or you could wear a hockey helmet and try to start a new trend.  "
"How to avoid getting hurt at metalcore concerts?","Stand near the sound desk if possible, you'll also get the added bonus of the sound being pretty good."

"How to avoid getting hurt at metalcore concerts?","THIS!!
I wish more people became a part of their local scene "
"How to avoid getting hurt at metalcore concerts?","Hey guys, I just wanted to thank you all for your awesome advices. They worked! I went to the show tonight and didn't end up with a concussion!! :) I found 3 cuts and 5 bruises, but nothing major...these are just normal ""battle wounds"" from having a great time at a concert. 

For those of you who haven't bought your tickets to the Disobedient Tour, I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it. It was by far one of the best shows I've ever been to! The TAA crowd was pretty rough &amp; the STYG crowd was so full of energy. In Hearts Wake rocked the show as well, but not many people seem to know them so the crowd was lame at best. Being As An Ocean was pretty good but I'm personally a huge fan of them so I was just chilling with my friend at the bar while they were performing so I can't tell you much. I saw this dude getting punched in the nose during STYG's performance but other than that, people were wild and fun but also very respectful to the people around them :-) "
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","I was listening to some As I Lay Dying and I couldn't understand the words during the unclean vocals. I feel like this happens to a lot of songs unless I concentrate on the vocals or just look them up. "
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","This use to happen to me a lot and it still does sometimes but I think after a while you become used to the pronouncing of words in screams especially from the same vocalist. 

Side note, it's one of the reasons people says metal sucks or whatever since they can't understand lyrics. "
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Yeah, I can't usually understand at first, but when I listen to a band enough I can understand them pretty well."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","That, and reading the lyrics. After reading them while listening, I almost never forget what they are again."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","I'll be honest, I've listened to metalcore for 6-7 years and I still can't really understand. I think part of it is that I'm usually more focused on the instrumental parts of the songs rather than the lyrics"
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Once I get used to a band/vocalist's vocal style, I don't really have any problem with it"
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","I usually am able to most of the time. But for the life of me, I could not understand Jesse when I was getting into Erra. I'm not even sure what it was but it just sounds like he doesn't enunciate his words enough when he sings."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","For the most part yeah. Unless it's a gurgle like [Wayne Knupp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqLwL7LIWaw) or god knows what the hell [Lord Worm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkNbTS7uhLE) does.

But I can understand someone like [Stu Block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nQ4ZR-NI6A),  [John Henry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QUl2AuT4ko), [Chance Garnette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX-bNkngk3U), [Phil Bozeman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3uB0jV2s48) (especially on their [newest album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9c1NaIDaAQ), [Tim Lambesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI3CF3CkYKM) (the guy from As I Lay Dying), [Bjorn Strid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl9ZfEkaqAs),[Karl Shubach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqMfm0bOFLk), [Jesse Leach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNhIw6Soa_4), [Howard Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0Em909-00Q), or [Tomas Lindberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Pm3cy3zPU) crystal clear like they're clean vocals.

Some I can understand for the most part, but not completely like [Linus Björklund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhowrsXn8Gs), [Matt Heafy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEe3rf6gqJQ), and [Ian Bearer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQYWC9ezebw)

I do struggle with some, like [Dimitri Minakakis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtbi9CHvikY), [Oliver Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8WSoKzhVfY) (I can understand the lows well enough, but his highs confuse me), [Scott Lewis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPhvx0oywMU) (early on at least, he's clear as day on [Die Without Hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjjhoQWX408), and [Jonny Davy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG7o3rWBud0). "
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","I like how you only mentioned the band on, Jesse Leach and Howard Jones aside, the best known vocalist in this (very fine) list "
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Karl Schubach ftw. Not only an amazing vocalist (both studio and live) but a killer dude. Met him when he came through Vancouver and shot the shit about the tour, how he was enjoying Canada, etc. Bro. "
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","When it comes to new bands, it's definitely really hard for me. Like OAA is a different language to me most of the time, but when I read the lyrics with it, it becomes so clear obviously."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","first time I listen to an album, I usually read the lyrics along with it, after that it's kinda ingrained in my head"
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Yeah once I listen to it a few times and know the lyrics it's not too bad. Some of the lines are still kinda hazy though in the songs I listen to"
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","I actually know the guitar parts of songs more than I know the lyrics... My ears just automatically focus on the riffs since I play. It takes some thinking to make out lyrics."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Same here. The guitars tend to attract me to songs (despite having not played guitar in a while) and then I get used to the vocals after listening to the song more."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","I'm the same! Always feels weird when I go to gigs and I'm not singing along because I know the riffs more than the vocals. "
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Kinda depends for me, if it's a really high or low scream then I have trouble making it out."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","On the first run through, usually not. I do make an effort to get the lyrics at some point, and and it usually comes pretty easily once you read the lyrics rather than trying to pick them all out on your own. When you know what to listen for it's kind of like... ""Oh, how did I not understand that?""

That said some vocalists just don't make an effort to be understood and the words never sound like words, even if you know what you're supposed to be hearing."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","I can understand some uncleans mostly lows and mids but I can't understand vocals like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVTTZfmIo1M) ( the yrics are infront me but I'm still lost) and also I'm clueless with blackened stuff and grindcore haha"
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Converge is tricky. They do not *aim* to be understood, and sometimes the lyrics even differ from the stuff that's actually said."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Yeah they do, the album of Jane Doe is a perfect example, great band, great album "
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","No, English isn't my native tongue and I never really focus on the lyrics, so it's almost impossible for me to understand them without looking them up."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","After listening to this type of music for as long as I have I understand most of the lyrics now. You just sort of develop an ear for it after a while."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Most of the time I can, but I generally don't care for the lyrics. I don't listen to metal to gain deep, philosophical worldly insight through its lyrical content. 

For the most part, I listen to the instruments, but if the lyrics are jarring then it can just kill an otherwise awesome song."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","It depends on the vocalist for me. I can hear ADTR, Attila, I See Stars just fine but ask me to tell you the lyrics to a Miss May I song and I'll get 85% of it wrong."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Depends who the vocalist is and how much emphasis they use on enunciation"
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Im a vocalist so about 90 percent of the time i can. But there are certain vocalists like Mike Champa for FATS thats is just impossible for me to understand. But people like Alex Koehler from Chelsea Grin or Eddie from SS and ASP i find are really easy to understand."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Just part of the general consensus: I'm better now than I was when I first started listening, especially with bands I know really well. Some people are just easier to understand than others (Jake from ABR is pretty good, so was Adrian from Northlane), but sometimes I'll be like ""whaaaa?"" and miss what they said. But its all good. I like reading lyrics anyways. "
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Once you get used to it understanding them becomes second nature"
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","If I listen to a song once, very vague maybe.

If I listen to it often, I hear the lyrics clearer every time i listen to it.

Also what the top comment guy said, some words are pronounced differently in screams and it also helps to get used to certain screamers.

In some earlier albums of BMTH, Oli had very unclear screams sometimes due to his IRL english accent and he pronounces some words in screams differently than other singers."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Whenever anyone uses the argument ""You can't understand them"" or I have someone ask ""Do you even understand that"" I compare it to learning a new language. You don't just jump right in and understand exactly what's going on, you just have to take your time and adjust to it. I just started listening to Volumes, for instance, and I'm starting to pick up on the vocals, but it'll take a bit."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","THE KELLOGS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE THIS 
Since english isn't my native tongue I always thought ABR put it into the lyrics for no reason,but then I looked it up and felt really stupid"
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Not at all."
"Do you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?","Sometimes."

"Really miss these guys. Attack Attack! - Pick A Side","Yes. When he was in Attack Attack! he didn't have the awful vocal style he does now though. He was similar to The Flood and the self titled album.

You should definitely check out the sings ""Stick Stickly"", ""Shred White and Blue"", and ""Dr. Shavargo Pt. 3"".

Be warned though, Attack Attack!'s first album is pretty heavy on the auto tune and synth stuff. Caleb Shomo (the vocalist from the album you've heard) actually played the synth back then. "

"Possible new ADTR material???","Click on it, then on tracklist.

You'll notice 3 extra songs on it. That's why it's its on a separate thing. Those are the 3 extra songs they released along with the CC hard copies

It took ADTR forever to release CC.

They'll tease an announcement, then announce the time for an announcement, then announce a new single along with a possible tour, then a 6 months to a year later we'll get a new album.

I expect new ADTR material in the later half of 2016"
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","Hello. I am looking for bands that have an atmospheric trait to their music. I love Periphery and Northlane. I think Northlane has some pretty atmospheric songs. And I do not mean completely atmospheric, I still want riffs and vocals, etc. Thanks in advance! If anyone is still confused as to what I mean I can try to explain it more in depth."
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","I assume you've listened to ERRA? They're the only kind of band I've heard to sound a bit like Northlane, only more chuggy."
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","The Discovery album by Born of Osiris is very atmospheric, you may like that."
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","Not really metalcore, but check out Tesseract. "
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","Try the new album by the Contortionist "
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","It's not metalcore, but you could give Fallujah's album [The Flesh Prevails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPypRw7yvVQ) a shot. 

Also [TesseracT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=get0cXOsSXg). 

And if you don't mind hip hop, try [cLOUDDEAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwGnpIX1I0M). "
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","fallujah is so good"
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","Architects would definitely be a good one, especially their last two albums. Also more post-hardcore, but The Overseer is another great band with a lot of atmospheric stuff"
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","Volumes has plenty of atmospheric and gentle parts between their usual aggressive sound. 

I would also head over to /r/djent. That style of music is definitely up your alley if you like Periphery and Northlane. "
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","ERRA is pretty atmosphery, i saw them in the Frozen Flame tour with Northlane and I have to say they made a fan out of me."
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","Surroundings and Prepared Like A Bride, both doing a similar thing to Northlane, especially Surroundings."
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","Try Silent Planet. They're not really similar to Northlane or Periphery, but they're really atmospheric and have released their first full album a few months ago. I love it."
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","Atmospheres. They have a cool ambient/djent sound"
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","[deleted]"
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","Oceana's first album ""The Tide"" is very atmospheric... one of my favorites! Then again I may be confusing atmospheric with ambient. Either way great album!
"
"Need suggestions for a certain type of music.","Make Them Suffer is atmospheric as shit, maybe Betraying the Martyrs? They're both definitely worth checking out."

Keyboardist and vocalist Joe Buras tweeted that Ronnie Canizaro will be heading to AA. 

This kinda really sucks..."
"Born of Osiris vocalist leaving to join Asking Alexandria","I call bullshit, those guys have always fucked with each other."
"Born of Osiris vocalist leaving to join Asking Alexandria","im pretty sure i saw it on the bands official twitter page last night, but its not there any more. I really hope you are right "
"Born of Osiris vocalist leaving to join Asking Alexandria","Well, since it was taken down, there are two options.
1. It was a joke and the label didn't find it amusing and it got taken down. (Most often all the band members will have access to the twitter account)
2. They weren't supposed to say anything and the label took it down because spoilers.
I'm going to go with option 1, because my sister went to high school with them, and they always fucked with each other. Band members do shit all the time, and I'd venture to say that if it's true the label would've said something. Bide your time and wait for either Sumerian or AA to say anything before getting antsy. I'd say with how well BOO is doing, it would be a fools move to leave for AA, and that's coming from a fan of both. Last I had heard the guy from Make Me Famous was the most likely candidate for replacement of Danny."
"Born of Osiris vocalist leaving to join Asking Alexandria","I fucking hope it's the first one..."

"Looking for a sound like Norma Jean","Looking for some new music as I haven't added nearly any to my library in awhile. 

I'm looking for bands or songs with a similiar sound to Norma Jean 

Specifically their album Meridonia, as well as some similiar to the sound in Wrongdoers 

I like the more industrial/instrumental elements in The Meridonial album like in the song 'Leaderless and Self-Entitled' "
"Looking for a sound like Norma Jean","The Chariot, 68, Maylene and the Sons of Disaster sound similair to their older albums"
"Looking for a sound like Norma Jean","Awesome 

Anything you know of that has that instrumental, almost orchestral sound of the Meridonial album?"
"Looking for a sound like Norma Jean","[The Ghost Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC14cRZJ6cM) sounds very similar to NJ.

"So what's the deal with Sworn In?","Wondering what everyone here thinks of them in general, an idea on why they seem to annoy so many and is their new stuff gonna be their Restoring Force? Personally I used to like them a bit. The slower tempo more breakdown heavy stuff got old after a while, Tyler's cleans aren't great and Barrier and Villains do this stuff a bit better but aren't as big as they should be. Let Down is still a jam though."
"So what's the deal with Sworn In?","Never was a fan of The Death Card, and their newer stuff is pretty meh. "
"So what's the deal with Sworn In?","It feels like they've gone backwards, meh is the word."
"So what's the deal with Sworn In?","I saw them on that Attila tour with Like Moths to Flames and Crown the Empire and they were the opener. It was my first time seeing them so I was looking forward to their set. Never have I heard such horrible playback in my history of going to shows. Granted, it was the first night of the tour and maybe technical difficulties were about, but it was the roughest sounding performance I've ever heard. Everything was muddled together and I had no idea what they were playing.

Their light up drum set was pretty dope tho."
"So what's the deal with Sworn In?","I like certain songs on the Death Card, (Deadpan and Snake Eyes are very good songs IMO), but their new stuff is pretty disappointing. Also, their live performances used to be sick, but Tyler's vocal abilities have gotten considerably worse. Watch a live video from just after the release of the Death Card and then compare it to their shows from the past couple months, you'll see what I mean. 



EDIT- Also barriers self titled EP is some of the angriest metalcore I've heard, its much better than sworn in imo

"Does anyone like LTAW (Album) by Struc/tures?? I love it, but feels like not so many people did.","I loved this album, actually more so than Divided By.

"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","Now that Bring Me The Horizon and Of Mice &amp; Men have ditched metalcore, which bands do you think will follow their lead?

I'm pretty confident that Beartooth will make the transition."
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","I think WCAR will head in the direction of radio rock with this new album they're making. The last thing I heard about them is that they went into the studio with David Bendeth who did Restoring Force, and has worked with other bands like Paramore and Linkin Park if I'm not mistaken"
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","They already sort of did on Tracing Back Roots, but I thought that album was a pretty good balance. I'm worried about the future for them though, because they could easily turn into another Of Mice &amp; Men"
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","You break up as a metalcore band or live long enough to see yourself become a rock band. 

But in all honesty, Crown The Empire is the main one I can think of.  Heading into My Chemical Romance territory. "
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","Crown The Empire was borderline radio rock to begin with."
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","If CTE was borderline radio rock to begin with than most popular post-hardcore bands should be considered radio rock."
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","1. Crown The Empire isn't post-hardcore

2. ""Popular"" post-hardcore bands such as SWS and PTV *can* be played on the radio

3. Post-hardcore is innately a softer genre than metalcore, so saying that post-hardcore bands are closer to radio rock is just a factually correct statement and contributes nothing.

3b. Metalcore isn't supposed to be on the radio, period. If a Sleeping With Sirens song snuck on the radio, I wouldn't be surprised nor would I be offended. Hearing Of Mice &amp; Men on the radio is offensive."
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","1. No need to get into the whole ""What constitutes post-hardcore/metalcore"" discussion, so I'll keep it simple. They're closer to bands like WCAR/PTV/IFAF/Silverstein than they are bands like ERRA/ABR/etc.

2. Anything *can* be played on the radio. When people talk about ""radio rock"" bands such as Breaking Benjamin, Red, 3 Days Grace, LP etc. come up. CTE's first album is nothing like that.

3. Except that's not what I said. I said that if you consider CTE to be borderline ""Radio rock"" then you must consider any post-hardcore band to be ""radio rock"". Not ""closer to"" but actual ""radio rock"". 

3b. Lol says who? You? Bands changing their sound to be attractive to the ""mainstream"" is one thing. But saying metalcore ""isn't supposed to be on the radio"" is just silly. You may not like OM&amp;M's latest sound, but it's leaps better than the majority of what's played on the radio."
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","Are you kidding? What radio station outside of maybe one dude in some remote corner of the country plays actual metalcore? And how many people actually listen to that radio station?

Metalcore is intended not to be a radio-friendly genre. It stems out of hardcore, which was the most anti-radio music genre before all the subgenres came along. No one wanted to hear songs about political resistance, circle pits or destroying religion on the radio and that's why hardcore was so great. It was something that only hardcore kids knew about.

Radio rock isn't exclusively the sounds of Breaking Benjamin, Linkin Park, etc. It's anything that someone would turn to a rock radio station and be able to stomach. CTE isn't quite there yet--which is what I said--but they're not far off. They're inoffensive sounding. They have very pristine, polished cleans and their guitar riffs aren't so crunchy and off-putting that your typical radio listener would immediately shut it off.

Metalcore is supposed to be a genre for the few, not the masses. I'm not trying to be a hipster or whatever and say ""this is soooo underground, you probably don't even know about it"" but it's *not* supposed to be a genre for corporations to mangle and spit back out so it can get radio play time."
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","Radio doesn't have some sort of static (not changing) requirement that has to be met in order to be played on it. They play what is popular.

Do I think that Fit for a King is going to be played on mainstream radio anytime soon? Of course not. But Metalcore, whether you like it or not, is becoming more popular, and with bands like BMTH, WCAR, PTV, OM&amp;M, and more gaining more popularity fairly quickly, it'll expose more people to their older material. Metalcore is only going to get more popular, and I hope it does. Metalcore isn't supposed to be anything. It is what it is."
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","But those bands are not getting popular for a metalcore sound. If OM&amp;M makes the radio, they're not making it with OG Loko or The Depths. They're making it with Broken Generation, or *maybe* Second &amp; Sebring. And I'm not saying I don't want people to get into metalcore, I'm saying that it's simply a fact that radio stations *USUALLY* do not put more run of the mill metalcore like FFAK on the radio."
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","OM&amp;M already gets frequent radio play on the hard rock stations on satellite radio for Would You Still Be There."
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","You're right, theyre not. But for every new fan they make with their current sound, theres the potential to introduce someone to their older material, and metalcore in general. And the more bands that break into the ""mainstream"" the more people will be exposed to it. Which is only going to make metalcore more popular. May not be by much, but still. Their live shows will still have heavy elements.

And yes, the radio, right now, does not play your run of the mill metalcore. Nor do I think that metalcore like that will ever really be fit for a radio (;D), but there are definitely some bands within the genre that people may be more open to one a mainstream level once theyve been introduced to the genre by other bands.

For example, I know plenty of people that would have never listened to music with screaming in it, until ADTR came along with Homesick. Suddenly, screaming wasn't so bad in some ways, and sure enough, some of those people got into heavier bands once they realized that screaming wasn't as bad as they thought. That same thing could very well happen with bands like BMTH or OM&amp;M. People become fans of their new material, decide to look at older stuff, decide that they like it, and bam.

My whole point is that no, I'm not generally a fan of bands changing their sound strictly to break into the ""mainstream"", but I would rather listen to OM&amp;M's new stuff than have to listen to 90% of whats on the radio right now."

"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","Rot wasn't really that progressive of a song though "
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","True, but also in interviews, they've been saying the new album is going to have softer moments, but still be heavy and progressive, plus at least IMO, Rot was still a great song, and very different from the watered down radio stuff Of Mice &amp; Men and bands like that are doing"
"What metalcore bands do you think will go #radiorock in the future?","It's still very watered down compared to their other stuff. Even compared to softer prog bands like Tesseract, it's still very bland. "

They're making the music they want to make, which as they grow up, happens to be less heavy. I know I for one would want them to make six different To Plant a Seed's in their career. I respect them for doing what they wanna do, I just know that there are lots of people out there like you (and there's nothing wrong with that) that will always want bands to sound exactly how they were when you first heard them. And that's just an unrealistic expectation. "
"We Came As Romans ""To Move On Is To Grow"" Official Video","Honetsly, I actually liked UWWGTB more than To Plant a Seed, I thought it was a good progression. The jump from UWWGTB to Tracing Back Roots was from metalcore to almost every song being post-hardcore. I didn't want 6 TPAS either, but I wish they kept the direction they were going with the second album. They dropped the technicality which is what I and many others loved about WCAR. I can still understand why their new music is enjoyed though, it is catchier and easier to follow. I still see their live shows, and support the band's future."
"We Came As Romans ""To Move On Is To Grow"" Official Video","I thought most of the tracks still sounded as if they fell into the metalcore subgenre, with a few (Fade Away, Never Let Me Go, etc.) gravitating toward radio rock. Not really post-hardcore to me. 

I may be one of the few, but I've enjoyed each album more than the last. And with Benedeth producing the new one, there will most likely be *even more* radio rock and less of the technicality + metalcore than there was on Tracing Back Roots. 

I don't really mind where they're going, I find it all to be pretty good. I just like to think of bands such as WCAR as less-talented A7X's lol.

There are enough small bars, youth centres and indie venues for all shows you want to book. I'd love to see a house show, but it just never happens."
"Beartooth go back to their roots with DIY venue and house shows","Pretty much this."
"Beartooth go back to their roots with DIY venue and house shows","There are heaps don't worry just they'll be local bands. I live in NZ we have maybe 5 different acts you may have heard of (inc lorde) but there's plenty of house shows here, but they have been mostly punk/fuzz rock bands"
"Beartooth go back to their roots with DIY venue and house shows","I hope they go back to their ""old"" sound too. Their EP is so much better than their full-length, imo. "
"Beartooth go back to their roots with DIY venue and house shows","Ah man, I'd give anything to be able to attend one of these house-shows. Seems so intimate and crazy! "
"Beartooth go back to their roots with DIY venue and house shows","Yeah, I remember their starting mantra was ""we don't want electronics, and this is a side band to not headline tours and what not."" A little different wording, but yeah."
"Beartooth go back to their roots with DIY venue and house shows","Well, it's not really their fault that they blew up. "
"Beartooth go back to their roots with DIY venue and house shows","I don't really care about the whole gimmick thing or whatever everyone else is saying. All I know is that they are coming to my town, which doesn't get a lot of good bands like these, and playing in a house. I am SO going to the show!"
"Beartooth go back to their roots with DIY venue and house shows","&gt;Hardcore punks Beartooth

Joke or not, that's where I stopped reading. Just no.

Also, I might be the only one that thinks this, but this seems so phony and gimmicky. A band with that kind of notoriety shouldn't be playing house shows. Is it a nice gesture? Yes, it is. But it also seems like a special snowflake move to try and make Beartooth out to be this hardcore DIY band...when they're stopping at three festivals in the middle of this run."
"Beartooth go back to their roots with DIY venue and house shows","I don't get it, they seem like they are doing house/diy shows for the sake not due to necessity "
"Beartooth go back to their roots with DIY venue and house shows","I don't see a huge problem with it. If they're going to have super cheap tickets and still put on awesome shows, it should be awesome. Fugazi was one of the biggest, most respected, and most innovative punk bands of their time and they played house shows, shows in churches, and even shows in basketball courts. They did it because of their DIY ethic and love for their fans. If Beartooth wants to do the same thing, that's awesome."
"Beartooth go back to their roots with DIY venue and house shows","But Fugazi wasn't part of such a commercialized scene."

"Essential metalcore bands?","&gt;They are gaining momentum but they are far from popular , judging off facebook likes and youtube views.

Anthony Fantano has done a review for their new album, so they are gaining some traction I guess.

&gt;Like I'd say they are a popular reddit band like heaps of people on reddit know them that listen to that music.

That's what I meant more or less. They're popular with people who listen to the music. Which is what's important, in my opinion. "
"Essential metalcore bands?","Anthony does small band reviews like Calaviire who tiny, he reviewed code orange's debut as well.

They have been popular on /r/hardcore and some people in /r/metalcore dig it. Its hard to explain though, like a band like Turnstile is bigger than them in the hardcore scene (who were upcoming) just they haven't got anywhere near the size of stuff like trapped under Ice"
"Essential metalcore bands?","I've seen them get a bit of love here on this sub though. I mentioned Silent Planet for the same reason. "
"Essential metalcore bands?","I have mentioned them a lot here tbh haha only in comments though. I was going to compare them to silent planet but I think Code Orange maybe more popular, what do you think?"

There are plenty of other, newer bands in the genre that are great (PWD, ADTR, TDWP, ABR, whoa acronyms) but if you really want a good sense of WHY the genre became popular and what bands were responsible for making it so, listen to these bands.  "
"Essential metalcore bands?","It is ridiculous what AOJB did for metalcore music. "
"Essential metalcore bands?","Exactly! I'm not even sure kids today are even aware of that album. I was in high school during the mid 2000s and got experience all the bands I listed in their heyday. There is a defined line in heavy metal, before AOJB and afterward."
"Essential metalcore bands?","As was I. I feel very privileged to have been part of that scene, as a young listener, and to witness it grow first hand. I use to crank Fixation on the Darkness when me and my buddies would play the first call of duty on our high school computers. Fuck, I feel old. "
"Do you prefer screams,cleans or mixed and why?",""
"Do you prefer screams,cleans or mixed and why?","Definitely screams, while I can appreciate good clean vocals, I feel like a lot of bands just throw in a chorus when they can't think of anything else, and it just sounds really boring. I'd much prefer a band just scream, and then have the melody come from the instrumental parts"
"Do you prefer screams,cleans or mixed and why?","I like when there are two vocalists that either have both screams or cleans and screams.  

For example, Erra has punishing screams with crazy clean parts.

Born of Osiris uses Ronnie's screams and Joe's screams perfectly together."
"Do you prefer screams,cleans or mixed and why?","Erra's cleans are hard as shit. And that's coming from someone who can sing well into the 6th octave with head voice. The clean vocalist is a powerhouse belter in my opinion. "
"Do you prefer screams,cleans or mixed and why?","I like both. Screams for brutality and cleans for catchiness."
"Do you prefer screams,cleans or mixed and why?","I prefer both. TAA is a good example of what I like, Joel has brutal screams that hit hard and Ahren has nice contrasting melodies."
"Do you prefer screams,cleans or mixed and why?","It really depends on the band. In general, I prefer all screams, cause those are the heaviest bands. Yet two of my last three favorite bands were sing-only bands. Lastly, I often hate it when a heavy band tries to incorporate choruses/refrains and yet try screaming through it. Gotta have the dynamism of clean vocals for that, in my opinion.

Examples of all three done right are (in respect to the order of the OP) Volumes (pre-No Sleep), Hands Like Houses, and newer Elitist"
"Do you prefer screams,cleans or mixed and why?","[Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktuWC9ZXdkY). I like growls/screams over the riffs because it's easier to pay attention to the guitars and drums. But I also like a clean chorus. "
"Do you prefer screams,cleans or mixed and why?","I like a mix, but with one vocalist especially when a scream edges into a rough clean."

"I want to get into Underoath a bit more."," I love underoath, from their old stuff to disambiguation when Aaron left. Their sound changed so much over the years especially between Dallas and Spencer. You really can't just listen to one album, they are all good. I would say my favorite is  cries of the past.

I'm assuming you don't torrent music...

I'd even say its on par as a whole package with define the great line but its really just opinionated at this point. depends which type of vibes im tryna feel.

They're a true influence to hundreds of thousands in the genre.  I just really have been digging LitSoS lately."
"I want to get into Underoath a bit more.","Define the Great Line is regarded as one of the best metalcore albums, normally the popular song on it being ""Writing on the Walls."" As far as my personal favorite, They're Only Chasing Safety wins that battle. Lost in the Sound of Separation has a lot more of the ""Verse, Chorus, Verse"" type songs. I consider it more mainstream friendly, but it is still a solid record. "

"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Hey /r/Metalcore! Hope everyones day is going well! I wanted to come here and ask for some opinions and advice from fellow redditors who are musicians in the metal(metalcore scene), so hopefully i'm not missing any rules against this or anything! 

My name is Dylan I am currently 16, I live in Ohio and i'm a vocalist. Currently I am able to do both Clean and Aggressive vocals(I lean more on aggressive since I prefer them with my voice), I have recently the last couple months been attempting to start a band in the metalcore/post-hardcore scenes. I have had one full ""attempt"" at a band so far that fell out didn't work and I would like some advice!

Being in my part of Ohio, there isn't that many metalheads that are more then vocalist. The original line up for my failed attempt of a band were two friends from school a guitarist and drummer who both weren't committed, and basically would bandwagon and only be apart if I started getting popular. Being my age I also am unable to drive far to the local scenes Dayton, Cincinnati, and mostly rely on social media for networking and connections.

I personally plan on learning instruments so I can be more useful then just a voice and lyrics(I really just want to help everyone and do as much as I can). I've been suggested by my cousin (who is a popular Hip Hop/Rap beat maker, to possibly me and him work together for a little demo with electronic instruments he can set up and use that as a start up/kinda a sound gage for how my vocals are and such.

What advice can you guys give me for trying to find people who are not only interested in actually committing to it, but also ways to better connect in my current situation(being 16, unable to drive far to meet others all the time, etc)? Any advice is appreciated! Thank you and have a wonderful day!!!

Tl;dr ""Unable to find musicians locally that aren't vocalists(I kinda got that part), aren't able to travel to the local scene often, but I really really wanna make music and perform and just have fun! Any advice is appreciated!"
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","I definitely know what that's like, I'm from western Massachusetts, also a vocalist, and the local scenes around here are pretty much dead. I'm 18 and can't really commit to anything too far away either. Pretty much just keep trying to find people, it's completely normal for your first few bands to fall apart. I'm going to college in Pennsylvania in the fall, and I'm hoping I'll be able to find more people there, since when I went there last summer for an ABR show, it seemed like there was a pretty good music scene there"
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Yeah I agree! Thank you for the advice and input! I obviously know that some of the first bands you try will fail and fall apart, it's just I don't know I just have so much energy and excitement for performing I just want to get out, and do it. I know with the local scene in Cinci and Dayton we are definitely active (how could we not? Tons of musicians came from the scene). My issue is not only finding shows to go to, but the arrangements to get there. 

I'm 16, finishing driving school on Thursday and taking my test next week for my license. It's a bit hard to really get down there all the time, even though I want to so badly. "

"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Learn guitar. That's always the hardest thing to find is a quality guitarist, who also can write. If you can play guitar then you can demo yourself, and just add drum tracks. That's what I do, because I can't find anyone in NE who wants to make a band haha"

"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","I'll cut to the chase, I understand but you don't need a ""metalhead"" guitarist, a kid that likes rock or punk would be fine, like they don't have to like the same music as you and I'm sure some people would just be happy to be in a band. So if you have other friends who play instruments ask them, or you could ask the music department at your school and post an ad and someone could be like yeah I'd want to sign up for his band. I'm from the other side of the world to you, so culture may be different"
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","At least from my experience, working with people who don't normally listen to this sort of music never goes well, because as far as playing/writing good metalcore songs, having some familiarity/interest in the genre is sort of important"
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Exactly, I know the two I was with in the original ""band"" I had set up they weren't into the metalcore scene that we I was looking to do. They were more into Rock and such. That's why I was looking for more people that like or atleast listen to the metalcore style."
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Even metalcore is such a wide-ranging genre that even if everyone likes metalcore, everyone still might be going in different directions, there was one band I was in where most of the people wanted to do risecore-type stuff, but then me and one guitarist wanted to go in a more heavy, progressive direction, and that didn't go too well"
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Yeah I completely agree, I know personally i'd really like to go the way of very heavy and progressive. I feel like possibly with the right people it can be done, my biggest strength that is also a weakness is always wanting everyone's opinions involved. So while I would want that, if someone else would want a rise-core type sound, i'd try to put their idea above or blended with mine. It's definatly a big thing to get through when starting a group is deciding how you want to play and the sound you want to project!"
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Definitely, I completely agree with you, it seems like finding the right people is one of the hardest things about starting a band. It's just really frustrating, because I've put in so much work to get my vocals to a good point, and I still practice constantly, but I still don't have a band to work with yet"
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Yeah I agree. I know lately I haven't gotten to do my practices every day like I was(mostly due to Drivers Ed and then trying to get my driving hours accomplished), I haven't practiced in a month so far. I know it isn't **THAT** bad but it's still bad and lose a lot of the stuff you had before. So i'm gonna start again this upcoming week once drivers ed is over, and i'm officially starting work. So i'll be able to take care of everything better.

My biggest issue is preforming at the moment, I don't want to do my aggressive vocals if i'm alone(so using an instrumental to do a cover in front of people), I just don't have it in me to do my normal moves I would if I had a band behind me(obviously in my room practicing is different cause that stuff is apart of my practice but still)."
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Ah, fair enough, what I usually do to practice is play songs through speakers and scream over it, since that way I still have instrumentals going, and being able to scream though songs by bands I like helps me judge how good my vocals are, I have some stuff written too, but I can't really work on those until I have instrumental parts and can start finding good screaming patterns for them"
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Yeah. That's practically what I do for practice, I have a playlist of songs I like and ways that i'd like to work my vocals to go(styles). I have a small issue with lyric writing, but it's something I work on often so hopefully my lyrics won't be garbage haha. "
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Makes sense, one thing I've been doing a lot recently is going through bands' live setlists, sort of to see how I'd do in terms of playing shows. For shorter, opening/support bands, I sound fine pretty much the whole way through, but I'm not really at a point where I can really do headliner-length setlists yet, since my voice gets tired after a while, especially since I have a very energetic screaming style, probably my best comparison would be a mix of Garrison from Erra and Jake from ABR"
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","I know I recently found setlist.fm and used that in a similar way. Before it was just open spotify, make a playlist find what songs I liked, style of vocals, etc. I know I sound pretty good with both so far while keeping my energetic stage presence. Usually I have been doing short sets though(mainly an all Beartooth support set), and such. But my ""headliner"" practice blends Beartooth, Of Mice &amp; Men, ATTILA, Amity Affliction, August Burns Red, Suicide Silence, Whitechapel, and Bring Me The Horizon. While some do have a ""similar"" style I use that as a small way to bump my way to the next style, so I don't strain or hurt my voice too much.

I know once I had a full hour in a half concert(including the pep talk/talking when members would retune for the next song, etc), full on jumping/bouncing, etc."
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Yeah, makes sense, I've mostly been going through the setlists from the Frozen Flame tour, since those are all bands I really like, and have fairly similar vocal styles to me, and the shorter sets are fine, the ABR setlist is still a bit difficult, because it's so long. I can scream through their full albums fine, what I did for a while was just scream through Rescue &amp; Restore, but their full headlining set is still pretty hard to do, though on a good night I can manage it, and I feel like with the adrenaline of an actual live show, I'd do a lot better, which is one reason I've been really wanting to find a new band"
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Yeah exactly! See that's the thing i've thought about to. With the adrenaline you gain from an actual show, like I feel that is going to push you and make you so much better. I haven't listened much to ABR setlist from the Frozen Flame Tour, I will probably try it out and see how I do."
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Sounds good, it's a really good setlist, with a bunch of really fun songs, it's just very tiring, especially with my screaming style"
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","I'll try it out! I hope all goes well for you man! Hopefully you find a group that works out for you!"
"Redditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)","Thanks! You too!"

"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","Dave Hunt/VITRIOL is probably my favorite vocalist in all of metal when it comes to just straight screaming. There's very few others that come close to him in terms of volume, anger, and just pure malice that he spews into the mic. What's even crazier than that though is the fact that he can rip his vocal cords out like this and still go back and have semi-cleans that still have some range and depth to them. That and [then they bust out songs in Latin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySsJPV9RLSQ).

"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","I notice the discussion tending towards [the longest screams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNSpeKpGGTg) in metalcore. But, if we're talking about best-sounding vocal ever, not necessarily accounting for skill (because there's a fair bit of production magic done on it), then look no further than [this wall of throat sound](http://youtu.be/C0D9Mqb86lI?t=3m8s)."
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","Whatever it is it won't be in a metalcore song."
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","Well who has the best scream in the metalcore genre"
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","There's a couple viable answers, Jake Leurs, Oli Sykes (I apologize if I'm spelling these wrong). I'm my personal opinion though,  Caleb Shomo, if you haven't listened to his scream look up I have a problem it's pretty incredible"
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","&gt; Leurs

Luhrs. Close enough though. "
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","Those three wouldn't be anywhere near the best vocalists IMO"
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","Well that's why it's subjective man. There's obviously no one answer to a question like  that. But to back up my selection the reason I like Shomo is because imo he has a great scream as well as being able to hit notes while singing that most metalcore vocalists sound like a whiny girl while singing and yet he still has a manly edge to his voice. Not to mention he writes and produces all of his own music. I know that shouldn't necessarily fall in his favor in a vocalist argument but as a produces and songwriter myself I really respect him for it. "
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","Unfortunately, I saw Beartooth with Silverstein 2 days ago and Caleb sounded AWFUL. He's completely destroyed his voice and didn't even scream half the words in his songs. He'd either let the crowd sing them or literally just speak them in longer vocal runs."
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","Strange, I've seen both bands 3 times and he sounded fine, granted the last time was nearly a year ago. Speaking of silverstein, how bout shane told? I wouldn't necessarily add him to a list of the best but that guy has been so consistent for so long. "
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","Yeah. I saw him at Warped this past year and he sounded great. Maybe he was having an off night, but I think it might be more than that. And Silverstein is and has been my favorite band for a very long time now so of course I'm going to say he sounded fan-fucking-tastic. Closed the show with an acoustic of Call it Karma... it was amazing."
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","Damn that's awesome.  They will always be in my top 5 simply because they don't feel the need to ""evolve"" or some bullshit like every other band. They know what they're good at so they do it, and you can depend on every album to be solid and have at least 6-7 good songs."
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","I did say IMO like we have different tastes and that's cool. There was no reason for my comment haha I think I just felt obliged to counter your argument, sorry dude.

On the talk of hitting notes, Greg Pucito from the Dillinger escape does it amazingly while screaming like a mad man"

"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","If you're going endurance wise, Telle Smith can belt a solid 30 seconds to a minute of a constant scream. Last warped tour he held a scream for a good minute. "
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","Telle in my opinion is one of the best vocalists around. He's so good. "
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","The entire band has some great talent, but for some reason they're studio stuff always comes up short and kinda meh."
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","Dude I know exactly what you're talking about. Telle, Zach, Tony, Daniel, and especially Luke have INCREDIBLE talent on their respective instruments, but everything they've put out after Deceiver has been so mediocre. 

They still kick ass live though even if they're newer music is pretty meh."
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","It's because of fucking Cameron Mizell"
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","I disagree Life cycles was produced by Joey Sturgis yet that album was nothing but chug chug chug melodic singing anthem heavy chug maybe one or two solos and then more chugs. Theres some hate for Mizell on this subreddit but i can honestly say as a fan of TWA since Craig was in the band that the reason the music is meh now solely lies with the band. "
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","You think? I think it's pretty awesome. Everything of theirs that I've listened to has been sorta meh at first, but it all grows on me massively. "
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","With most metalcore bands the product is greater than the sum of its parts or however that saying goes. Opposite is true for TWA."
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","Honestly, I think Telle is one of the best overall vocalist in the genre. His screams are fucking killer, and his cleans are pretty awesome. Most bands that have 1 scream/singer usually lacks in one of those departments live, but Telle kills both clean and unclean vocals live.

Obviously there are quite a few clean vocalist and unclean vocalist that are more talented, but I'm talking overall."
"What is the best scream/growl ever recorded in a song?","Came here to say this. Saw them live on their recent tour and he held that outro scream on Broken Circuit for about three times as long as it lasts on the record. It was the most unreal vocal performance I think I've seen live. 

Really reminds me of Chester Bennington crushing that huge twenty second scream on Given Up."

Edit: I should additionally say that I don't agree that this excuses his previous sayings about the LGBT community. That was a pretty rash comment."
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","So this guy's response to everyone getting pissed off at him is ""well that's just my opinion""? And you're going to suggest that *my* judgement is retarded?

It has everything to do with music. If a dude in a band is a bag of dicks, it means that buying that band's music, merch, tickets, etc. directly supports that aforementioned bag of dicks. It's all intertwined. If a person is a piece of shit, they can be the greatest musician on the planet and they don't deserve support IMO."
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","Jesus christ, you act like this guy is funding a fucking Neo-Nazi organization to make sure all gays don't get offended by the word ""faggot"". I'm willing to bet some (if not a lot) of your music that you listen to was written, played, or produced by someone just as bad, if not worse, and you just don't know it. Do we honestly need to know the full political background of every member of a band in order to enjoy their music? Music is fucking music and it shouldn't be anything more than that, when you start to involve people's personal live's and opinions then it is no different than ridiculous celebrity gossip."
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","So let me ask you a question slugger: do you think Front Porch Step should still be touring? Do you think people should still be buying his music?"
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","Once again, you act like Phil is directly doing something to harm a group of people. You are comparing a man stating his opinions to literal sexual harassment. In the case of Front Porch Step, it's more than just opinions, it is real disgusting actions that he is taking. So no, I don't think people should support him, and I think you can realistically realize that there is a *very* big difference between Labonte and McElfresh. But if one enjoys the music either of them make, there is no shame in that, **it's  just music.**
"
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","Okay, then let me throw a different one at you...how do you feel about Varg Vikernes of Burzum? He's an avowed neo-nazi. Aside from the actions he's taken that have gotten him in trouble, do you think people should support him even though he's a neo-nazi?

IMO, terrible people do not deserve support. It's impossible for me to listen to someone's music and not think ""oh yeah, this guy is a total fucking idiot"""
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","Once again, that's a radically different situation, that guy is a fucking neo-nazi. My point is that if we based all the music we listen to on the opinions of the members of the group then there'd be a lot less music for us to enjoy. Phil Labonte hasn't harassed anyone or hurt anyone, he has simply stated his opinions, and suddenly that has an affect on how you enjoy the music? Neo-Nazis and sexual assault is a whole other issue that I agree, I wouldn't want to support the music either. But for an opinion that quite frankly a large amount of America believes? You're not funding a fucking terrorist here.  
And please don't give me any more examples. There are countless black metal and rap bands that are even worse than the things up and said, from church burning and gang violence."
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","Wouldn't surprise me, I know he's said a lot of pretty ridiculous things"
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","Interesting how Periphery recently dropped Vik Guitars after the owner made disparaging comments about Cynic for having gay members in it. I wonder if they know about this comment and if it'll come up on tour!"
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","Except the guy isn't homophobic by a long shot. He's a hardcore libertarian and atheist who just thinks the LGBT community shouldn't be as offended by a word as the black community."

"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","Does anyone know if In Flames plays any of their good ol' days music on their tours? Or do they mainly stick to their new stuff? "
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","The oldest they go now is Clayman, maybe one song from Colony if they feel like it."
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","I saw them like 4 years ago (Trivium opened) and they played a pretty decent mix of new and old, they have so many albums they can't play every good song, but I mostly went to see Trivium, IF was just a bonus."
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","You can check out their setlists here: http://www.setlist.fm/setlists/in-flames-43d6837f.html

It's mostly new stuff with a couple classics thrown in the mix here and there"
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","You guys say it doesn't matter what political stance the members take, its about the music. But that's bull. If the lead singer is a bigot I will never listen to them. Even if they're the best thing since sliced bread. They don't deserve my support."
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","I thought that read as All American Rejects and Periphery and just about shit myself with WTFness. "
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","Move Along is a better album than the most recent ATR and In Flames albums."
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","Well, I just saw Periphery last week but damn this would have been a dream concert for me if they came to Oregon. Still probably seeing In Flames and All That Remains when they come around with Wovenwar though."
"All That Remains and Periphery to tour with In Flames in the USA","I'd rather watch ATR play the entirety of A War You Cannot Win live than In Flames play two songs from Siren Charms."

"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","I'm gonna be seeing them tomorrow live so I was wondering, what are some good songs by them?"
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","Listen to their whole album ""The hollow"" it's fantastic. One of the few albums I can think of where I don't dislike any songs."
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","This is the only album I listen to from them."
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","Definitely their best work. A song in particular I'd recommend is The Sinner. "
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","You're gonna want to listen to [Jezebel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26FDl2DoIws) because it is easily their best song musically AND lyrically."
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","How did I know you were going to post this?"
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","&gt;She's on the prowl. She wants it all &amp; she'll stop at nothing! Everyone knows she's well aware of the fact that her self respect was long lost on her search for something. First in line to give it up to the guy at the bar buying two drinks at a time. One track mind, it's disgusting that she thinks she's got it all figured out, but what she doesn't know is that to us she's just another one of them. Girls like you are a dime a dozen.

"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","[The Hollow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAzsp73UMXw&amp;list=PL631BE3A21BD64794) is their best album imo

but [Vices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_yCTsL3pOU) is their best song"
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","Go listen to their first EP and forget everything you know about them. That is literally the greatest music you will ever hear."
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","[Here's](http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/memphis-may-fire/2015/danforth-music-hall-toronto-on-canada-7bca6e90.html) their current setlist. Surprisingly, there are only 3 songs from their (awful) new album. But I'd suggest listening to those if you want to know what to expect. They aren't playing anything from the Sleepwalking album, which is IMO their best one. If you wanna listen to their best work just start with that one. Personally I think Challenger is their 2nd best album, and they still play a lot of songs from that live. I could not really get into The Sinner, but many people here view it as their best album. They play the title track off that though, which is a pretty good song."
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","No Ordinary Love sucks a thousand dicks, but other than that that's a surprisingly decent setlist. At this point they have to realize that their fans don't want to hear the shitty new album so it's nice seeing them play relatively old songs. Also btw the album is called The Hollow, not The Sinner."
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","Oops. Oh well, in my head it's just the ""The"" album."
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","Totally agree with Sleepwalking being their best album all time. 3  out of 9 songs is awful enough.. they should just replace them with songs out of Sleepwalking."
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","Not really that into them, but I'd say their best song is Vices"
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","Challenger forever my favorite album. Alive in the Lights hits me hard. "
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","Vices is by far their best song "
"Memphis May Fire song recommendations?","The Hollow is definitely their best album they aren't gonna play much off it. Probably only The Sinner. "

"Here is a list of great bands that you probably haven't heard before, oh and its all free!","http://store.throatruinerrecords.com/freedownloads all these are free, but if you like it, support the artist and label by buying a shirt or a cd or vinyl.

This is just one of the many great artist [Calaviire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFakCyn3azs) for fans of Converge, trap them, has a member from Birds in row and he described it as a ""crusty converge"".

I'm not going to give a link to every band, as some stuff is region blocked but here is [Nesseria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPlCRWlCKic) they remind me harms way a bit guess, but aggressive metallic hardcore either way with some sludge in there.

[Vermin Womb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxbdMiyhZyo) heavy as, they remind me of Nails a bit, but with growled vocals.

[Protestant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8E11plffPQ) these guys remind a lot of cult leader.

[Plebeian Grandstand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn8-ikePJj8) blackened hardcore/crust ? i could be wrong but they are sick.

[Death Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO5EAqz0mkk) reminds me a bit of amenra but more hardcore oriented.

Just go through the youtube channel and see what you like, it is free, I only found them all quite recently so i don't know the best songs, but I strongly recommend you listening to these.


Not all is metalcore but there is a great mix of metallic hardcore, sludge, post metal, hardcore and noise and etc just go through the [label's channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnchCgOeYXXB_Uh8ItIno6Q) and see what you like.

Hope you dig these bands as much i do.

"Here is a list of great bands that you probably haven't heard before, oh and its all free!","Throatruiner put out some brilliant stuff. Enjoyed Verdun, Birds In Row, Cowards and Vuyrvr(think thats how it's spelt) off the top of my head. Seeing Plebian Grandstand too this Wednesday. "
"Here is a list of great bands that you probably haven't heard before, oh and its all free!","They sure do, could I ask where you are from?  I think its spelt wrong but doesn't matter haha. Glad to see you know of them, I just thought most people on this sub wouldn't know the bands or the label. (may know birds in row because of deathwish inc, another great band). Enjoy the show!"
"Here is a list of great bands that you probably haven't heard before, oh and its all free!","I'm from the UK, suprised Plebian are even playing here. Checked my ipod, it's Vuyvr. I stumbled across the label a few years ago looking for a copy of Birds In Rows collections I think, unfortunately I don't think it's many people tastes on this sub. Shame cause it doesn't get enough love. "
"Here is a list of great bands that you probably haven't heard before, oh and its all free!","I only discovered it a week ago but I'm so glad I did. I was starting to see more Converge love so I thought people may dig it here ."
"Here is a list of great bands that you probably haven't heard before, oh and its all free!","I only knew Birds In Row, but I just downloaded every album from that list with a genre description that interested me.  Got a GB or so of music to check out.  Very excited to check it out.

I'd just like to point out that for a smaller indie record label, putting up a bunch of free downloads like this is a great move.  They may not have gotten any of my money (yet) but now I have heard of a bunch of their bands I otherwise never would of known about, and very likely may end up spending money on other releases.  "
"Here is a list of great bands that you probably haven't heard before, oh and its all free!","Check out the band page for descriptions on the label's site as it  probably  a bit more accurate. But I'm really glad you ate checking it out, I hope you dig it.

I agree its a great idea, as I'm not the biggest on pirating so I nay have remembered one band and spotified them for a month then maybe buy the album, but now I shared it to you, we all found new artists on the label and I'm probably going to buy a decent sized purchase sometime this year."
"Here is a list of great bands that you probably haven't heard before, oh and its all free!","I'd recommend Plebeian Grandstand's video for Thvrst for anyone with epileptic fits. "
"What should Miss May I change if they're going to make a new album?","I love their live performances ,but they fucked up big time with the new album"
"What should Miss May I change if they're going to make a new album?","I personally loved ROTL, though it doesn't hold a candle to Monument. I'd like to see more of a mix between ROTL and Monument on future releases. Find that balance between melodic choruses and heavy verses."
"What should Miss May I change if they're going to make a new album?","You described how I feel about them exactly

Edit: Though I'd be even happier if they added more variety to the songs, and didn't just follow the verse/chorus/verse/chorus format so much"
"What should Miss May I change if they're going to make a new album?","Levi's vocals need more production than last album.  I hate encouraging this, but they do.

Ryan's vocals need to be less compressed.  They felt very unemotional. "
"What should Miss May I change if they're going to make a new album?","I kind of liked Ryan's vocals. It's what separates him from others I think. He kinda has a Volbeat style."
"What should Miss May I change if they're going to make a new album?","The album sounded fine to me, they just needed better guitarwork. "
"What should Miss May I change if they're going to make a new album?","I just think the production value/quality on ROTL was pitiful. It all sounded trashy and over compressed. They need that full, dark, rich tone that Monument/At Heart had. Just play the albums side by side. Monument feels like it is taking up all the space in your ears, so does At Heart; while ROTL sounds so flat and amatuer. Songwriting wise...ROTL isn't atrocious musically. The riffs are cool, but the lyrics just sorta make me cringe. I get what they tried to do with them, but it didn't work. If they go back to that full sound, and better lyrical content...I think they'll be fine. I like At Heart for the most part, and I don't mind Levi's new screams. In fact, ""Hey Mister"" is my favorite MMI song, but I think production and lyrical content really let them down this last album. "
"What should Miss May I change if they're going to make a new album?","Straight up if Levi can't sound better, they would need to get someone else. This obviously won't happen though."
"What should Miss May I change if they're going to make a new album?","Apologies Are For The Weak. "

"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","Nah, last year was a lot worse, at least IMO"
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","Dude last year was a banger. The Ghost Inside, Volumes, Beartooth, Anberlin, Parkway Drive, The Story So Far, Four Year Strong, Every Time I Die, Neck Deep, State Champs, Yellowcard, Stray From The Path, Issues, Vanna, This Wild Life, A Lot Like Birds, To The Wind, Fit For A King, Real Friends, Elder Brother, the list was ridiculous. I didn't even get to see like 3/4 of that list. 

2013 and 2014 were the two years I had to make tough compromises to see the bands I REALLY wanted to. This year for me, it's just '68, Being As An Ocean, Hundredth, Have Mercy, and Slaves and I wont even be sad if I can't see the last two. FFAK, This Wild Life, and Neck Deep are repeats, but I've already seen them. And Emarosa isn't even coming to my date, but they would totally be on my must-see list."
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","The only bands I really liked last year were Beartooth, Born of Osiris, Every Time I Die, and The Story So Far, I already like that many bands on this year's tour, and I feel like at least a few more bands I like are going to get announced. 2013 was definitely a great year though"
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","I feel like it's according to taste, I usually go Warped for Pop punk bans I usually can't catch and in that way it's pretty good this year. But metalcore has really only 4 bands representing this year. Also I still remember 2008 and 2009 having bands like 3oh3 as the headliner so it's  not the worst but yeah pretty lacking."
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","68 is decent, I wish The Chariot was still together and playing instead though"
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","68 and Emarosa are cool, but still not enough quality bands that would make me want to go"
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","Yeah, this."
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","True. And Emarosa aren't even coming to my date. I'm sad. Right now for me its just BAAO, Hundredth, and '68. 

I hope they still have some bangers in their pocket. "
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","68 is sweet, but i don't think it's enough to go. Other than that, if I didn't live just an hour away from their hometown, I'd go for PUP alone. Although they're not metalcore, I suggest to anyone who's going to check them out.

"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","I believe 2011 had whitechapel and suicide silence as well"
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","That was 2010"
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","PUP are sick mate, check them out. Not metalcore but still. "
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","Too many people are giving up faith!

Maybe Warped is announcing all of the smaller bands early (with a few big names here and there ie: BvB, BTF, Neck Deep to keep people interested) so that more people know them when summer hits. They'll be dropping some big names towards the end of winter I'd assume.

I mean think about it, there's only a handful of main stage acts to have been announced thus far. Don't lose hope friends. "
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","That's sort of my theory as well, Levi from Miss May I pretty much revealed that they're playing, plus I have a pretty strong feeling that ABR is also playing this year"
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","Yes Modsun!"
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","I mean, I'm really enjoying this year's lineup. At least 15 bands so far I've liked, and they're announcing until April, so I'm even more excited.

To each their own, though, I guess. "
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","Blessthefall, Crossfaith, and Our Last Night was enough to seal the deal for me"

"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","Yes, forgot about them"
"New Warped Announcements - MC Lars, '68, Emarosa, PUP, and Modsun.","I really am hating these announcments they're just jerking us around by making us think oh this wednesday will be good and then all these shit bands get accounced with BVB or Amity Afffliction being thrown in there so it seems like it was a good announcment. I mean I love warped tour I go every year to catch pop punk and metalcore bands with friends all day. But I feel like they should just announce like 2 big bands in seperate short videos and then put all the small time edm and scene shit in their own small videos."

"Does Anyone Know What Gauge Strings Architects Guitarists Use?","I'm assuming they play in a drop tuning, probably C, right? You'll want a slightly heavier gauge, and some simple intonation fixes. I play in Drop C and some variants, and I get a lot of work out of Ernie Ball Heavy Bottom, Slinky Tops. 

These are just some educated guesses though. The folks over at /r/guitars are pretty knowledgeable and helpful, so give them a holler!"
"Does Anyone Know What Gauge Strings Architects Guitarists Use?","They actually play in really odd tunings. The lowest string is tuned down to around G# sometimes even Gb with the rest of the guitar at around C# standard. Its bizarre."
"Does Anyone Know What Gauge Strings Architects Guitarists Use?","I bought a seven string just to play this kind of shit so I know the guitar isn't getting messed up by the weird tunings. "
"Does Anyone Know What Gauge Strings Architects Guitarists Use?","I watched in a interview somewhere that Tom left the guitar in the sun and the first string accidently dropped to F#. He knew that Mastodon played some old songs in a similiar tunning so he tried it and liked it."

"Does Anyone Know What Gauge Strings Architects Guitarists Use?","Eh, yea a little. I use a Gibson so the scale is kinda short. Ideally you'd want a guitar with at least a 25.5"" scale, but its not too terrible."

"In Hearts Wake - Departure (feat. Winston McCall)","I feel like In Hearts Wake is really good at shifting their music (even just slightly) to sound like the person they have featured in the song. So you'll notice right as Winston comes in the drums change up just a bit and the song overall sounds a little bit like a PWD song.  
They do it in [Earthwalker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ0QCx792gI) when Joel from TAA comes in. The guitars sound a bit more Amity-like, and the vocal effect at ~1:33 is staight out of Amity's playbook. Just something I noticed."
"In Hearts Wake - Departure (feat. Winston McCall)","I definitely agree, they're really good at changing it slightly to fit the guest vocals. It's the same in Shapeless when Adrian comes in, it just changed to a bit more of a Northlane vibe. It really adds to the song."
"In Hearts Wake - Departure (feat. Winston McCall)","Yeap, i always thought departure sounded pretty PWD like"

With that being said why does this have a Popular band tag? "

"In Hearts Wake - Departure (feat. Winston McCall)","Maybe it's from an Australian point of view, In Hearts Wake would definitely be considered ""popular"" in the Australian scene. "

"Worried about the new Of Mice &amp; Men tour...","I'm excited as hell for the Full Circle tour, because it's three of the bands I love (OM&amp;M, CTE, and Volumes) but I *reaaaaallly* hope Of Mice &amp; Men's setlist isn't all Restoring Force. Unfortunately, their recent setlists have been almost exclusively that. And since the reissue will be out by then. I'm almost certain the mediocre-at-best new tracks will find a way on the setlist as well. I just hope I get to hear Second &amp; Sebring, at least. Thoughts?"
"Worried about the new Of Mice &amp; Men tour...","Well here's the thing dude: the past few tours they've been out on were as support acts for Linkin Park, meaning they play only 30-ish minutes and try to cater to those listeners that haven't heard of them/are nu-metal fans/etc. So they play a lot of songs for that demographic. 

Obviously, they're going to play a lot of their new stuff on a headliner too, as that's the album cycle they are touring for. They want to sell records/people to hear the new jams/stuff of that nature. But, they'll be playing a lot longer and I'm sure they do realize they have tons of fans of their first two CD's. So my point is, the setlist won't be front to back Restoring Force. My best bet would be half songs from the first two CD's, half tracks from the new record. 

Not a huge OM&amp;M fan, but just looking at it from past experiences/logical standpoints. CtE puts on a good show, and Volumes is sick so I'd say go to the show. Any metalcore show, especially of bands you like, is better than sitting around for the night. "
"Worried about the new Of Mice &amp; Men tour...","yeah this is what I was thinking as well. they're not gonna play the crazy stuff at a LP show, I don't blame them. "

"The Color Morale - Demon Teeth (any love for TCM in this sub :O?)","Actually yes, I've noticed quite a bit of Converge jerking, especially from you, not saying it's bad, but it's a bit hypocritical after you complain about other bands you don't like as much being jerked"

the highest rated Converge song is at a whopping 79. The first 25 posts all have UNDER 100 upvotes.

that's not taking into account that the quality of Converge discussions is usually less masturbatory than ABR/PWD love, which anyone who frequents this sub can easily tell you

"The Color Morale - Demon Teeth (any love for TCM in this sub :O?)","I think a lot of it is that I got here after a lot of the really bad ABR circlejerking, so I didn't realize how bad it was and unintentionally contributed a lot to it, after looking through some of those search results, I definitely see what you mean, while I like ABR quite a bit, I agree that a lot of what's said about them in this sub (including some of my past comments) is pretty ridiculous, my apologies, I've only been involved with this sub, and Reddit in general, for about 5 months, so I'm still relatively new, I've been trying to do a lot less ABR jerking recently, and now I'm only mentioning them in threads where it actually makes sense for me to talk about them"

"Please take the time to sign this petition about facebook charging money to bands for reaching ""fans"" they have already acquired. More info inside.","While I agree with the point of the petition - there's nothing anyone can do? It's just part of facebook's business model."
"Please take the time to sign this petition about facebook charging money to bands for reaching ""fans"" they have already acquired. More info inside.","They used to have options to pay for promotions and advertising on other pages/other people's feeds. Let's say I listen to Northlane, and Invent, Animate wants to promote to people who listen to Northlane, there used to be a fee you could pay to get promoted on Northlane's page as well as on the ""things you might like"" section for people who liked Northlane. Now its not only that, but if you want your posts to show up (for people who have already liked your page) on people's feeds, you have to pay money for access to that. They already liked the page, they already subscribed interest in your material. Bands shouldn't have to pay to reach those people. You don't pay for your friends to see your status updates on how br00tal the new Falling In Reverse album is. So why does The Browning need to pay for their Facebook fans to see that they've booked a new tour? "
"Please take the time to sign this petition about facebook charging money to bands for reaching ""fans"" they have already acquired. More info inside.","I agree you shouldn't have to pay to reach your fans, but the fact is that you're still on Facebook's site. They can do whatever they want in terms of charging people and trying to make them change policies on the grounds of ethics wouldn't hold any weight."
"Please take the time to sign this petition about facebook charging money to bands for reaching ""fans"" they have already acquired. More info inside.","I mean, to an extent. Companies should do whatever they want, regardless of how they treat their users? Ethics should play a role in how you run your company. "
"Please take the time to sign this petition about facebook charging money to bands for reaching ""fans"" they have already acquired. More info inside.","In general if users feel like they are being treated badly then they will simply move to another site/company. Unfortunately there is no other site (except for maybe twitter) so they are forced to pay. Sure it's unethical but there is a market for it and some bands seem to be willing to pay - so from their point of view why should they stop?"
"Please take the time to sign this petition about facebook charging money to bands for reaching ""fans"" they have already acquired. More info inside.","It wasn't until recently and correct me if I'm wrong but they were doing more than fine without this."
"Please take the time to sign this petition about facebook charging money to bands for reaching ""fans"" they have already acquired. More info inside.","They're also a business, and businesses try to make money. This is why I wish MySpace were still relevant."

"Please take the time to sign this petition about facebook charging money to bands for reaching ""fans"" they have already acquired. More info inside.","For people who run bandpages, paying money to facebook so people can actually see what you post on on your page pretty much costs more than you would ever make playing a show now for local bands. On top of buying gear, rehearsal rooms, petrol (gas), advertising and taking time off work for shows it is next to impossible for new bands to make an impact anywhere without investing a fuck ton of money as it is, the last thing any one needs are these ludicrous fees (that we already pay) added on top."

They make their money off adverts. That is totally cool, and I respect that. But charging kids who don't even make any money so people actually know they exist? That's shitty.

Giant acts like Kanye West and who ever the fuck with millions of dollars behind them are subject to the same rules as some 15 year old kids playing in their dads garage on some 10 watt marshals. It doesn't make sense. They have forced them selves into our lives and now are expecting us to pay for it."

"What songs would you consider beautiful?","[""Americans"" by This or The Apocalypse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBsP91lRxs) is my personal choice.

And while it's not exactly metalcore, I consider [""Flourish"" by The Contortionist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW53D7VvgvI) the most beautiful metal song I've ever heard."
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","Exoplanet is one of my favorite albums of all time! Around 2012 I kind of fell out of the metal loop though, so I haven't heard the two newer albums from The Contortionist yet. I'm kind of worried to check them out as well, since I think it will be tough to top Exoplanet. Are they good?"
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","There're both great, language is definitely a lot different from exoplanet though."
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","we were just kids by emmure

"What songs would you consider beautiful?","We were just kids hits home for me. I love the emotion he puts in it. Best track hands down off the album.
[Emmure - We were just kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOIRJ5N01I8)"
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","I never expected an emmure song to hit me so hard emotionally but it's one of only a few songs that hits my feels that hard!"
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","You should check out [Rusted Over Wet Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36DXqFBQAZU) as well. It's about losing his child and man does it hit me"

"What songs would you consider beautiful?","No links because I'm on mobile but

Heart - Erra
Kansas - the Devil Wears Prada
The Distant Blue - Architects
Hospital for Souls - Bring Me the Horizon
Vahle/Edge of the Earth- Volumes
This One's for You/Farewell to Shady Glade - Of Mice &amp; Men

Most of these probably aren't beautiful in a traditional sense, but the meaning and passion behind them makes them beautiful to me."
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","points for Heart."
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","I've had Lost Together since it came out and I never got into The Distance Blue until like a week ago when I listened to it and it just hit me how great it was"
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","One of the only songs to ever leave me speechless, it's fantastic. "
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","Probably [I Cum Blood by Cannibal Corpse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8gi_yLF8r8).

Just kidding! I'd say [Beauty in Tragedy by August Burns Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-noYJ459dE)."

"What songs would you consider beautiful?","Cannonball Crops confirmed to be the next Of Austin &amp; Carlile."
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","Yes! Beauty in Tragedy is my choice too. Love that song!"
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","I think this is one of the most beautifully crafted songs ever. The second one. That break in the middle of the song along with the buildup right after sends chills down my spine every time. "
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","Beauty in Tragedy was the first metalcore song I heard and it is amazing(2yearsago).Still can't believe not every metalcore fan knows this song "
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","[Avenged Sevenfold - So Far Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7ry4cx6HfY)

It's about The Rev. For those who are not familiar with the band, that's their late drummer/childhood best friend"
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","I may not be a fan of avenged sevenfold, but this is an amazing song. "
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","I'm not sure how familiar you are with their discography, but they have quite a few songs that are on the softer, more ""emotional"" side that aren't your ""typical"" A7x songs. This is one of them :p"
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","Definitely. I used to listen to quite a bit of A7X. They were one of my gateway band into metalcore, but now that I've heard other bands I like better, I'm not really a huge fan of them. That being said, I love afterlife, Crimson day, acid rain, seize the day, and save me. "
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","All great songs.

I'm a bit biased because they've been my favorite band since I first discovered them in like 2006 haha.

They were also one of the bands that got me into heavier music (along with Blessthefall/BFMV/Atreyu) but they've always been my favorite band, no competition. I don't even put them on the same level as other bands haha.

Their diversity, talent as songwriters, and how they act as a band, along with the music itself just hooks me like no other band has :p

Did you ever listen to the Diamonds in the Rough B-side album?"
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","What's funny is the drummer of my favorite band Dream Theater left to be the drummer for your favorite band for one album. I never listened to that album actually. Maybe I just wasn't a huge fan of the hail to the king album. That's about when I stopped listening to them and when I started to listen to stuff like Memphis May Fire, and eventually August Burns Red. I didn't start listening to MMF until about October of last year, and ABR until about January of this year. I'm really new to this genre to be honest "
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","Good ole Mike Portnoy.

He holds a special place with the big A7x fans. He really helped out the band at a time when they needed it. They were incredibly close to breaking up but he stepped up and recorded the drum parts that were already written, as well as putting down some of his own stuff. I have so much respect for him because of that.

Hail To The King is a great album, but its definitely not my favorite  It's very bare bones compared to what they normally sound like, and that was intentional. I hope that their next album has more harmonies/layers like theyre known for. They wanted to prove they could have a bare bones album reminiscent of the old school metal, and they did.

Diamonds in the Rough is a b-side album from the Self-titled era, and was released along with their live DVD.

Heres some of my favorites from the album:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtUpj4sVCDQ

If you're still new to the genre, and you like MMF and bands similar to them, checkout blessthefall if you havent already. Theyre my second favorite band :p and are the primary band that got me into post hardcore/metalcore/etc. All of their material is fantastic."

"What songs would you consider beautiful?","I've always considered ""Hush Yael"" by Oh, Sleeper beautiful. When I read the backstory it sent chills down my spine. "

"What songs would you consider beautiful?","wait tell me more... what were some of your conclusions?"
"What songs would you consider beautiful?","The theme over the semester was community, our research paper was our choice on how a specific community used writing, so obviously I picked lyrics in the music I like and how people that aren't into heavy music assume it's gibberish and devil music blah blah blah.

"Northlane - The Calling [2013] // One of my favorite off Singularity.","My biggest problem with a lot of bands is the whiny singing. I love Northlane, ABR, PWD, and Zombie EP screaming. Sounds rough but not gurgling if you know what I mean. "

"Northlane - The Calling [2013] // One of my favorite off Singularity.","I was one of them.  I saw their posts, I think the last one I paid attention to was a video of Dispossession and at the time I just didn't like it.  Then I check out their setlist and holy crap do I love everything off Singularity.  And Rot is just so orgasmic.  I read up on their story for searching for their current vocalist and I thought that was so damn cool."

"One of Northlane's less popular songs, still one of their best IMO, Abrasumente","I love Singularity, but I find myself skipping a lot of songs on that one. Quantum Flux and Dream Awake most of the time, Singularity [the instrumental one with the quote] every single time and Masquerade most of the time too. So that's half of the album. But goddamn, I fucking love the other ones, specially the first four, so it's really hard for me to say which one I prefer."

"What song do you think is the Stairway to Heaven of metalcore?","I don't really know what you mean by that, but I'd guess...

If you meant immensely popular song that everyone who listens to the genre could recognize in seconds, I'd say either [Carrion by PWD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNvOVey0MSs), or [Unholy Confessions by Avenged Sevenfold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-QaFWURsMU).

If you meant a song that could be used to define Metalcore, I could say either something by the early Metalliic Hardcore bands, like Converge probably, but I would lean towards something like [Back Burner by ABR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SrQQJMuVfg), because it showcases everything from pre-generic age Metalcore: riff-based songwriting, non repeating song structure, and, of course, a balls heavy breakdown."
"What song do you think is the Stairway to Heaven of metalcore?","To clear things up, I was meaning like a song that has a nice slow build up that has a lot of smooth transitions into new verses and a powerful ending."
"What song do you think is the Stairway to Heaven of metalcore?","Well in that case I'd say [Marianas Trench by ABR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oADtFkUzfCo)."

"What song do you think is the Stairway to Heaven of metalcore?","Definitely agree there"

"What song do you think is the Stairway to Heaven of metalcore?","Wild Eyes - PWD"
"What song do you think is the Stairway to Heaven of metalcore?","Maybe since its the song that got me into metalcore and the masterpiece of one of the best modern metalcore records ever, Tears Don't Fall by Bullet for my Valentine. 

Also, since its brand new I wouldn't argue much for it, but in sheer epicness I'd say Omega by Periphery."

"A Day To Remember - Your Way With Words Is Through Silence",""
"A Day To Remember - Your Way With Words Is Through Silence","Does anyone else do that thing where you start listening to a band, find their older music, and then like it better than all the new stuff?"
"A Day To Remember - Your Way With Words Is Through Silence","I agree, But with ADTR I have found all of their releases to be great. Their older albums are non-replaceable but I really enjoyed CC."
"A Day To Remember - Your Way With Words Is Through Silence","Yeah, happens a lot. Mostly because when a band starts becoming popular, their label pressures them to conform to what's popular in the scene instead of innovating and doing their own thing. Thus shittifying their sound. Some bands avoid it, others come out of it, but a fair few just become worse and worse until they break up."

I'm a little older now (25) especially compared to most of the kids at shows.  I'm always afraid I'm gonna hurt some 16 year old girl whether I get thrown into her or whatever.  So nowadays I usually just default to the 21+ section or the balcony or whatever."

"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","I think mine definitely would be seeing Beartooth at Pittsburgh Warped last summer. They were on one of the smaller stages, but had a main-stage sized crowd that completely engulfed the sound tent for the stage, which was about 100-150 ft back from the barricade. Anyways, mid-set, we open up this huge circle pit around the tent, just hundreds of kids running in a huge circle around the sound tent for the last three songs of their set. My buddies and I had so much fun. I think the only way it could get any better would be to see them at a house show.

The other really fun live shows are I See Stars gigs. In the transitions between songs, they blast dubstep/EDM. Not that I'm a fan of that kind of music really, its just a non stop dance/jumping/mosh party from the time they go on, til the time the encore is over. "
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","I met The Devil Wears Prada and Enter Shikari at Warped last year. My two favourite bands."
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","enter shikari shows are the best. the energy they have on stage and the crowds are always jumping, pushing, and singing a long. love them"
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","Every and any time I have seen Crossfaith. They could get a pit going in a cemetery."
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","Warped Tour '09 watching Haste the Day's set. They close with When Everything Falls and Stephen Keech climbs into the crowd and me, my buddy, and 2 other people hold him up in the air in the middle of everyone while almost every single person sings along."
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","The first time I heard the outro of In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth:3 live after the album came out.
Every single person in the god damn room screaming the ""whoa, oh oh oh's"""
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","Seeing Enter Shikari and thinking ""well lets stay behind the pit and watch the entire show peacefully"" then Meltdown (second song) starts and just went apeshit with everybody else."
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","I would have said moshing to Crown The Empire a few months ago, being my first time in the pit.

But on Wednesday I got to see ABR as covered by some of my favorite bands and crowdsurfed for the first time.  That absolutely takes the cake."
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","[deleted]"
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","I got to talk to Beau from blessthefall at the Heart support tent for a long time at warped tour 2013. Super chill guy. Met all of ABR there too."
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","I was at a show that the black dahlia murder was playing. I got to pat the vocalists belly and crowdsurf. Also there was a wedding on the stage which was pretty fucking rad. It was a really small venue. The floor was just one giant wave of good vibes."
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","Jake Luhrs from abr looked at me and made a heart gesture with his hands during a concert last year, and didn't stop looking at me until I've done the same gesture to him"
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","When I was in 8th grade I went to a festival and was watching As I Lay Dying, just standing off to the side and headbanging/screaming the words as loud as I could. This guy comes up to my friend and I and is like ""Wanna go to the pit?"" I had never been in one, but for some reason I thought this was a good idea. So here is this 5' 8"", 160 lb 8th grader running around trying to shove these massive college/older aged metal heads around, and it was a blast. There hasn't been a moment in my life where I was just having such pure fun. "
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","I'm a female, 5'5"", and a serial mosher. I am, admittedly, rather strong and broad-shouldered for someone of my height and gender. I always mosh when I go to shows, sometimes for hours. At almost every show I've been to, I've had random strangers (both male and female) tell me how inspiring it was to see me in the pit and how much they enjoyed my energy. I don't really understand why this occurs, but it makes me very happy. It's very worth the minor injuries I have sustained over the years ( broken finger, blows to the head that took a bit to heal, etc.). I actually got to crowd surf during warped at one point when 2 250+ pound moshbros picked me up and sent me away. That was pretty fun. I also sing and scream, and have been complimented on my vocals at shows before. I don't understand why seemingly every heavy genre except metalcore has a good popular female singer/screamer (Arch Enemy, Huntress, etc.). The closest thing I can think of is Eyes Set To Kill, but neither of the female vocalists scream. Basically, all concerts are amazing for me. I'm right at home."
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","I saw eyes set to kill live, it was kind of disappointing :("
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","We need a good female frontwoman in metalcore. Now, if only I could find instrumentalists to back me up...XD"
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","Saw Hacktivist with Dead Harts and The One Hundred last year and it was such an insane night. In the pit I saw a guy go down in front of me so I went to help him up, he grabbed my arm as I got literally thrown over him and I pulled him up and he stabilized my fall, then he disappeared back into the pit, it took me a while to understand what happened. Was certain I was going to eat shit head first into the floor"
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","I had a chance to see Obey the Brave, Emmure, and a couple more bands a couple years back and it was great. Alex From OTB is a great guy and was hanging out selling mercy after the show. I walked up to him and he autographed my phone case and got the rest of the band to sign it too. I bought a shirt and we talked for a couple minutes and it was one of the coolest experiences I've had with a person whom I idolize. "
"What's the best experience you've had at a show?","Saw We Came As Romans and Like Moths To Flames in Bakersfield. Talked to Chris from LMTF, nicest most chill dude ever. Then talked with Josh and Eric from WCAR, both totally nice dudes, Kyle was there but walked away when my wife and I came up, seemed kinda douchey:/. Also chatted with Lou and Andy briefly before they played, super awesome guys as well. Main reason they're my favorite band."

"Blessthefall: Carry On (With Jake Luhrs). I'm in love with this track right now.","The first time I actually listened to blessthefall was when I went to see ABR at a show on the tour /u/DeadBlessings mentioned.  I thought they were pretty good, but when I got home and looked em up I was actually disappointed.  The cleans were what killed it for me.  It was just too overproduced on the songs I listened to.  The sad part of it is they (the cleans) actually sounded good live.  I can't listen to their studio stuff, but I think I would go see them again. "
"Blessthefall: Carry On (With Jake Luhrs). I'm in love with this track right now.","Yeah, I really don't like over produced vocals. In general they seems kinda generic and the vocalist was too high. It's kind of my problem with most metalcore."
"All That Remains - ""The Order of Things"" First Impressions","Started listening to this on Apple's First Play. I'm a huge fan of metal and ATR, but holy shit this is a bad album. Am I the only one that feels this way? "
"All That Remains - ""The Order of Things"" First Impressions","Not heavy. Time to give up hoping for Fall of Ideals type tracks. "
"All That Remains - ""The Order of Things"" First Impressions","I'm not expecting Fall of Ideals again. I'd be ok with Overcome or even For We Are Many. The last album (A War You Cannot Win) got me thinking like ""ok this isn't very good, but they'll do better on the next one."" Now that we're on the next one, it's SO TERRIBLE it makes me cringe. It's bad when the newest Nickelback album is heavier than ATR. I think if I wanted to see them evolve I wish they would have evolved into something similar to the last couple As I Lay Dying albums (even though most AILD hate their last couple albums). "
"All That Remains - ""The Order of Things"" First Impressions","Hahaha, aside from a few cheesy lyrics, I fucking love this album. I really don't get what you people are looking for from these guys now, there's awesome guitars and crazy drums, and plenty of screaming (at least for my taste). The vocals were really the only ""bad"" part about this album and only a few songs at that. But a lot of the melodies just soar and kick ass, and when there is screaming it is great, especially on ""Trv-Kvlt-Metal"" and ""Victory Lap"". I don't know why y'all say they sold out and went radio friendly, because if I had a radio station around here that would play this kind of stuff I'd shit myself."
"All That Remains - ""The Order of Things"" First Impressions","Musically, I think this is better than their last two or three albums. The vocals ruin the album (Have you heard ""The Greatest Generation""?). Phil barely has any range and it seems emotionless, he has to depend on Jeanne for backup vox. And the lyrics! The lyrics sound like the struggles of a pubescent 13 year old kid. Honestly i dont know where this band is going to go after this album.
"
"All That Remains - ""The Order of Things"" First Impressions","I'm just going to copy and paste what I wrote on Facebook about the album

All That Remains's new album is great just in terms of musicianship. If just looked at in terms of a heavy rock album, there are few flaws. 
The disappointing thing is that ATR released, in my opinion, two of the best metalcore albums of the last decade in The Fall of Ideals and For We Are Many, and then they put out A War You Cannot Win (only 5 songs with screaming) and then The Order of Things, that has 4. I don't care if a band screams or not. Sometimes I'll say the music would sound better with screams, but that's not my criteria for judging a band. 
But when you give me a song like The Weak Willed and then follow that up with What if I Was Nothing (""I told you that I loved you girl, I'm nothing without you"") I'm going to be a little pissed"
"All That Remains - ""The Order of Things"" First Impressions","Nope."
"Going to see my first concert today.

"Going to see my first concert today. Going to the Disobedient tour in Sacramento.","Hey man, have fun. I wanted to go, but I have a closing shift tonight. :(

"Going to see my first concert today. Going to the Disobedient tour in Sacramento.","My roommate is going without me because I have work. However, I have seen STYG quite a few times and they are ALWAYS fantastic. Their setlists don't disappoint, the mic is passed to damn near everyone, and from my experience the crowd is never really douchey or bro'y. Everyone is just there for a good time. If it is your first show just be conscious of what's going on around you. The pits will get going and although no one really wants to intentionally hurt anyone, it is a possibility. "

"Going to see my first concert today. Going to the Disobedient tour in Sacramento.","So IHW played a total of 5 songs with 2 off of divination?"
"Going to see my first concert today. Going to the Disobedient tour in Sacramento."," Yup they were the opening band. Followed by '68 which killed the mood of the place. IHW definitely should have gone before TAA and needed to play more songs. "

"Going to see my first concert today. Going to the Disobedient tour in Sacramento.","I recently started listening to them so not too sure what songs were played but they opened with pittsburg, the weigh down and i think they closed with dont lean on me but they played more songs"

"Going to see my first concert today. Going to the Disobedient tour in Sacramento.","Sadly no. I thought they would since they were touring together but it just wouldn't seem right if they did. They were the first band to play and TAA was second to last. So to me it would have been weird to have him come out and then go back inside for another 2 hours."

"Guitarists, I have a question","Hey guys,

So I've been trying to record some stuff with my buddy, just for fun for now. I've been playing for a long time, but only recently have I started to take it seriously, and I have a lot of ideas in my head to record and what not, but when I try and transfer them to guitar, I get ""finger""-tied. Sometimes when I try and speed up a riff or make something a little more complex, my fingers can't keep up.


Does anyone have any tips or little exercises I can work on? Anything is appreciated. :)"
"Guitarists, I have a question","Get a metronome, start practicing your riffs at a low BPM and work your way up to the speed that you want. Just keep practicing it and you'll get it. "
"Guitarists, I have a question","This is essentially it. Also, try to break the riff down as a physical exercise while practicing it slowly. Concentrate on what your fingers feel like when you play it correctly. Sometimes, there is a little bit of physical strain - learn to enjoy this. "
"Guitarists, I have a question","Haha I've never heard or thought about that before. Thanks!"

"What bands have you discovered because of this subreddit?","The Dillinger Escape Pan, Every Time I Die and also heaps of non metalcore like shoegaze ones from like aderptmember , like Slowdive is so good.

Also John Coffey and a few small bands. I find more small bands I like over at /r/hardcore personally "

Bury Tomorrow

Fit For A King (known about them since their first EP, but never really listened)"
"What bands have you discovered because of this subreddit?","Fit for a king wasn't good until their last album."
"What bands have you discovered because of this subreddit?","Ehhh, their last album is definitely the best, by far. It's why I actually started listening to them on a regular basis, but the album before that I wouldnt call it bad. Forgettable is a better description imo"
"What bands have you discovered because of this subreddit?","yeah, most metalcore is forgettable."

"Numbers - Undertow",""
"Numbers - Undertow","I've always wondered why they don't get more attention. All of their releases so far have been solid."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Anyone actually excited for warped?

I am pretty disappointed myself compared to last year. 

Last year we had TDWP, I the breather, the color morale, issues, beartooth, the word alive, Chelsea grin, crown the empire, etc. 

So far only bands I'm excited for are FFAK and Blessthefall this year. "
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","The Pop Punk kid in me might go. Plus there's a few good metalcore/melodic hardcore bands, but yeah this year isn't really good :-/"
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Ugh, The Story So Far isn't going to be there but they have another show in my town like a week later. "
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","This year's is one of the worst lineups ever, but there's a LOT of good bands to go see. Moose Blood, Hundredth, '68, Grey Gordon, The Wonder Years/Aaron West, Fit For A King, Have Mercy, I Killed The Prom Queen, Major League, Riff Raff and Sirens &amp; Sailors are all great, plus there's a couple more announcements to be made. We haven't thought about some bands that are yet to be announced that are possibilities:

1. Miss May I - pretty sure someone posted a thread on here a short time ago saying they'd confirmed they'd be on the tour.

2. Northlane - a good test to see how Marcus fares over here on a long tour, plus they have new music coming out.

3. Dance Gavin Dance - they have a new album coming out in April and no announced touring plans after early May. They've got name recognition and could draw crowds. 

So let's not write this tour off just yet. It really isn't that bad."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","If DGD goes that definitely confirms on going this year"
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Even if dgd does go, I'd rather pay $40 for a vip ticket for them, stolas, polyphia, and hail the sun in April. Fuck warped this year. "
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Northlane unfortunately said they aren't playing"
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","seriously? that sucks. they'd work so well on this year's tour."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","I completely agree, seems like they're playing festivals in Europe instead though"
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","I also have think that Ice Nine Kills and Crown the Empire will probably join on. CTE made a couple of posts the other day on Facebook reminiscing on warped."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Nah.  

I've seen btf and taa already, only other band I'd want to see is baao"
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","But '68 though"
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Baao is pretty gr8"
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Nope. This year is shit. Excited for Mayhem though. "
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","And Summer Slaughter for me "
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","It never comes anywhere near me, but if the rumors of Dahlia playing are true I'm driving somewhere."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Why Mayhem? Do we know anything yet? I saw Linkin Park was a rumored headliner which I'd be fine with, but a lot of people would freak out."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Yes, but I can see why people who mainly listen to metalcore might not be yet. With bands like Hundredth, Being As An Ocean, '68, The Amity Affliction &amp; Handguns though, I'm excited. Also don't count out the lineup until its fully announced, something might catch your eye soon!"
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","No, not yet at least. Hopefully The All Stars Tour will have a good lineup this year though."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","I also agree that the line-up is far less stellar than last year. I don't know if they are holding back on the announcements, or just dropped the ball on us. I haven't been as excited after an announcement since the first week, Neck Deep and Palisades. But to piggyback /u/moshlyfe, there could still be some announcements that could sway more people into going:  
* Oceans Ate Alaska - they just released their first record through Fearless and have received lots of praise (from at least what I've seen in the community)  
* Myka, Relocate - another great choice that aren't touring in the near future, but also are recording / finishing recording  
* For The Win - (if you can get past their name) a fantastic pop-punk band that put out an album with Artery but are almost being ignored. Very little touring with even less promotion. I think Warped would be a saving grace for this band with so many pop-punk bands being there. I feel the label should have forced them onto us like Fearless did with As It Is.  
I know these are not huge names, but any one of these would guarantee my trip."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","I think we were all kinda spoiled by last year. There was an insane amount of good bands. This year isn't as good, but there's still enough bands I like for me to be excited. Asking Alexandria, Blessthefall, Crossfaith, Escape the Fate (not as excited, I'd rather have Dead Rabbitts), Fit For A King, Hundredth, IKTPQ, Icon For Hire, Sirens and Sailors, and The Amity Affliction. That's a lot of good bands for one day. Plus there's still more announcements, so we might get a couple more good bands."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","I'd much rather The Dead Rabbitts too. I thought I heard something going around a few months ago about TDR playing warped, but then ETF got announced and then I got sad. "
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Maybe Craig might try double duty? It'd probably be stupid, but you never know."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Double duty on warped tour just seems like a sick joke to play on yourself. 

Though, Scout from Issues kinda did it last year. "
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Yeah, but it's a little easier for a DJ. I wouldn't want to do that to my throat."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","I really don't know what the idea is behind the announcements. You think if you're gonna do weekly announcements it'd be so you could fit two big namers in with your small timers every week so people feel a need to check back. But this year it's more like 1 big name every 3 weeks and the in between time is just Bryan Stars reading facebook band profiles off his phone for shitty pop or electronica artists who nobody wants to see or will. The worst part is I honestly feel it's dehyped warp imagine if they did like montly announcments for big timers so 1 month they announce Blessthefall, Escape the Fate, and Neck Deep. That'd look really cool and give a reason to check back on announcements but no we just get disappointing week by week action."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","I'm still going this year regardless. There are a couple bands I really enjoy, but my friend and I go every year regardless of the line up. He's not even a metalcore fan either. He goes with hardly any knowledge of the line up and just watches whatever and has a blast. "
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","I just want to see Hundredth so badly that I might go "
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Are the Road To Warped bands going to be playing regular Warped? Because if so I'll be a lot happier with it. "
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","There are some pretty good bands this year, just not metalcore ones. And I'm not spending that kinda money to go see 2 or 3 metalcore bands. "
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Metalcore bands on Warped 2015 (so far): Asking Alexandria, Blessthfall, Crossfaith, Fit For A King, I Killed the Prom Queen, The Amity Affliction, Sirens and Sailors, and While She Sleeps."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Should clarify:

2 or 3 metalcore bands I'm interested in or who are worth seeing live for $40. "
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","So far I'm liking it about as much as last year, though I'm still hoping some more good bands get announced. This year I'm looking forward to Fit For a King, Blessthefall, Hundredth, and Being as an Ocean. Last year the only bands I was really into were Crown the Empire, Born of Osiris, Beartooth, and The Story So Far. I'm still hoping for a lineup I liked as much as 2013, where there were a lot of bands I liked, but so far no luck."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","So you didn't see INK, TDWP, Chelsea Grin, Parkway Drive, etc last year?"
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","I saw Ice Nine Kills while I was waiting for Born of Osiris, but I'm not really a fan of any of them"
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Beartooth is gonna play."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","They did last year though, so there's no guarantees. "
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","They are playing just watch. I know they are."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Blessthefall (Would go just for them), Crossfaith, FFAK, Our Last Night, and the Amity Affliction.

Plus some others that I wouldn't pay to see but I would definitely watch like ETF, Hands like House, and AA."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Im pretty stoked. I get to finally see Our Last Night and Amity Affliction. And Asking Alexandria. Also I hear I Killed he Prom Queen is god so I'll probably catch their set. 
Oh, and Set It Off will be there, and I dig their stuff so I'll probably see them too."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Not sure anything can beat last year's, though. I got to see CTE, OM&amp;M, Attila, Issues, ADTR, Chelsea Grin, TWA, FATS (for a second)."
"Anyone excited for warped this year?","Hundredth, Being As An Ocean, The Amity Affliction, The Wonder Years and Rotting Out should be enough to get anyone to go. Hell, maybe even Asking Alexandria to see their new vocalist."

You can tell Danny had quite a few difficulties with his voice through-out his carreer with Asking Alexandria (blowing his voice out, wrecking his cords). I think We Are Harlot suits his voice a lot better and probably strains his vocals cords a lot less. Besides, now AA can leave the rock 'n roll stuff behind and go back to making Metalcore on the next record. "

"I See Stars - Boris The Animal","I would have to agree.  The only reason I didn't say anything was because it's still a damn good album for the circumstances they were under when they put it out.

"Guilty Pleasure aspects of a song","yes, I know this has been asked, but that was like a year ago and new people and music are here. 

my guilty pleasure aspect is definitely the thundering, pounding drums - especially from Life Cycles (TWA). There are plenty of songs on that record that just go hard and the drums and bass are just ridiculously chuggy and I love it. Paired with Telle's screams, it makes from some simple but pleasant breakdowns and I just love listening to them with the bass all the way up in my car. Makes long drives pleasurable.

"Pre-production on the new KSE album has officially begun","Their 2009 album (self titled) was only co-produced by Adam. Their style was a bit different and didn't quite feel like a Killswitch album. Adam is part of the band and the fact that he's also their producer really adds to the outcome. They have a distinct style. Also, they typically avoid performing anything from that particular album now that they have another album out. "

"What was your Metalcore journey like?","The other day as I was walking to class, I was shuffling through my iPod only to have it choose ""If I'm James Dean, You're Audrey Hepburn"" by Sleeping With Sirens. I have now outgrown all whiny, heartbreak-core bands so I hit next which skipped to a Kublai Khan song (I can't remember which) and I couldn't help but realize that my taste in music was like some metaphorical black hole, which only drags me deeper into heaviness as i get older. I noticed that the amount of time I have listened to metal is directly proportional to the heaviness of the music that I currently listen to. I wondered if everyone else was like this; getting progressively heavier in their metal tastes as they lived day-by-day. Main point... I am posting this discussion because I want to hear the musical journeys of anyone who wants to share. Not really looking for a specific format. Maybe just what you started with, what phases you went through, and just whatever you feel like sharing. Maybe I'll find some new material to jam or maybe I'll just be entertained for the moment. Thanks!"
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Underoath lead to Norma Jean which lead to Haste the Day which lead to The Devil Wears Prada which lead to August Burns Red.

Then I went through a genericore phase with Attack Attack!, Asking Alexandria, etc.

I dig more riff oriented stuff now, but every now and then a breakdown fest is fun."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","It was weird for me, I got into metal core when a friend showed me barbarian by Abr back in like 06 then I got into miss may i/AA/Om&amp;M

Then I got over that and got into like The plot in you, upon a burning body and now 

I'm more into TesseracT/Periphery/Animals As leaders/the contortionist. "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Yeah I kinda had the same path OP. I got into metalcore through TDWP, As I Lay Dying, Atreyu, Bullet For My Valentine, August Burns Red in the late 2000s. As I got older I got into heavier, and heavier stuff.. Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, Acacia Strain, Chelsea Grin. But now I am getting into more and more melodic/djenty stuff. ERRA, Periphery, Northlane, Animals as Leaders, TesseracT, Invent, Animate...

I just love this genre, I have always loved it and I have never strayed from it once."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Now that I think about it, I would say my path parallels yours more. I got heavier and heavier and then I can say that I have also fallen into the more melodic stuff. It's almost like I've lived a full life and retired into easier going melodicore. 

Also, it's funny that you mention Invent, Animate. I went to school with all of the members and they are some rad dudes without a doubt. "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","That's awesome!! Everything they've written and put out I have found incredible. They should be huge, I really like that band."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","y'all are sweethearts :-)"

"What was your Metalcore journey like?","&lt;3 u bb"
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Slipknot lead me to Killswitch Engage, into All That Remains, onto As I Lay Dying, and then around '07 into deathcore bands like Suicide Silence, Born of Osiris, All Shall Perish, Veil of Maya, and Whitechapel, now I pretty much check out anything and everything I can that might interest me"
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Like a lot of others I'm sure, my first metalcore band was Bullet For My Valentine. I remember hearing the band name, knwoing nothing about them, googling them, listening to Tears Don't Fall and I was fucking hooked. That was probably 6th or 7th grade (I'm a freshman in college now). From there it just kind of grew like the heads on a hydra, Bring Me the Horizon, Sleeping with Sirens, Slipknot, Avenged Sevenfold, Alesana, etc. just came pouring in to my music library. 

My only real ""phase"" was between 8th grade and 9th grade, I was moving away from post hardcore and metalcore and was really into deathcore, death metal and slam death metal. I think 30% of that was trying to be that scary goth kid for my freshman year of high school (I was).

But I mean, I still listen to Bullet, Sleeping with Sirens, and all those other bands, while continuing to find new bands all the time."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","I'm also a freshman in college and it's funny you mention BFMV. The reason I got into to ANY heavy music was purely because for some reason they showed the video for Scream, Aim, Fire on MTV (weird, I know). I'm glad they did because it totally pulled me away from the MTV shit they play on the radio nowadays."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Man this is so weird to think about. I think I started listening to The Amity Affliction, because they're from the same city as me. They were all I listened to for a solid year (which is fucked because this was back when they only had 2 EP's). Then I got into pretty much any other heavy Australian band, like Parkway, IKTPQ, Carpathian, House vs. Hurricane, The Red Shore etc. The only non-Australian band I liked at that point was BMTH, because they played on IKTPQ's farewell tour. 

Then Parkway Drive brought Suicide Silence out on tour when I was like 15 and their performance blew my mind so I started to listen to a lot more American stuff (All That Remains, ADTR, The Plot in You, The Ghost Inside). At this point I also started to listen to more European stuff as well, but there weren't too many bands I liked from Europe. 

And now I'm kind of back to listening to pretty much only Australian bands (Northlane, IKTPQ, 50 Lions, Thy Art is Murder, Violent Soho, Hand of Mercy) because in my opinion a lot (not all though) American bands try to copy each other's sounds too much. So I guess my journey went by geography, not really genres. "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","That's definitely interesting! And I agree with you concerning the similarity between American bands. It's the reason why I mainly listen to EU/UK stuff."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Throatruiner put out some amazing stuff and the church of Ra is great too."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","My favourite Aussie band would be idylls, they are sick "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","When it comes to the start of my ""Metalcore Journey"", there are actually a few specific songs that seemed to have played a pretty big role.

It all started around 2007/2008 hearing songs like Waking The Demon by Bullet For My Valentine. Then listening to bands As I Lay Dying and Bring Me The Horizon. I still remember thinking that 'Through Struggle' and 'Pray For Plagues' was the heaviest thing I ever heard back then. Sometime later me and my friends would discover a band named Miss May I when they first released their demo in 2008. I remember hearing No Need To Whip A Dead Horse( the song now known as Porcelain Wings) and thinking that breakdown was one of the craziest things ever.

Then sometime later A Day To Remember released Homesick in 2009. I was just sitting in class and heard this one girl talking about a band named A Day To Remember. Didn't think much of it but still decided to check them out once I got home that day. I wish I could remember the first song I heard by them but I believe it was Fast Forward to 2012. I immediately fell in love with the band and just sat their listening to their whole discography over and over again,especially For Those Who Have Heart.

After that I just discovered more and more bands. August Burns Red, We Came As Romans, Parkway Drive,Texas In July, The Devil Wears Prada and more.

In 2011 I went to my first Metalcore show and I just fell more and more in love with metal/death/hard. Going to all kinds of shows,discovering more bands.

Thinking back over those early years kind of makes me miss the times when bands had  long and nonsensical names like ""Who Speaks Spanish,Colon Quesadilla,HTML Rulez D00d,Things That Rhyme With Orange. Also when bands had neon colored merch,with all kinds of crazy designs on them."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Converge &gt; oathbreaker &gt; every time I die &gt; the Dillinger escape plan &gt; gaza/cult leader  (these two not as much) &gt; possibly old underoath

These is my metalcore route , I listen to other bands in the genre just not as much as these bands or just singles from them, my metalcore route kinda went softer I guess but at the same time in other genres I've gone heavier.

Edit: I just realised the first metalcore song I heard was hand of blood by bfmv but it didn't lead to anything as I was younger, it was in a video game. Botch before every time I die"
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","When I was in 5th grade, my friend introduced me to Linkin Park. Another friend recommended Breaking Benjamin and Simple Plan. I loved, and still love, these bands. Then one day I heard a Saosin song (I think it was ""Finding Home"" from their self-titled album) and the style sounded a little like Simple Plan's, only heavier and more technical. I looked into Saosin's old stuff and found myself highly enjoying ""Seven Years"" and ""They Perched On Their Stilts"" cause of how aggressive and raw the style was. 

I then chanced upon a news article about a psycho who kidnapped a girl by posing as Oli Sykes. This got me interested in BMTH so I started listening to their album There Is A Heaven and loved it. One of my classmates then told me to listen to Chthonic (black/death metal band from my native country, Taiwan) and on a search for similar songs I found Erra's album Impulse. "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Rob zombie/slipknot into demon hunter, into oh sleeper, into august burns red. "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Interesting..."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","some scene girl i used to know sent me the link to stick stickly and i haven't looked back since lol"
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","It's kind of fuzzy but the bands I started out with were, Underoath, Norma Jean, Haste The Day and ABR with their demo and EP."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","I started out by pretty much listening to almost every band on the 2012 Warped tour, since that was pretty much my introduction to this sort of music, before slowly getting more focused on the things I like, first Blessthefall, then Of Mice &amp; Men (back when they weren't terrible), then finally August Burns Red, who's been my favorite band since then, though the other bands I listen to continue to change a lot, right now I'm really into a lot of atmospheric/progressive stuff "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","I started out listening to Alesana and discovered Asking Alexandria through one of the songs featuring the clean vocalist. After that, I started listening to OM&amp;M and MMF through the Flood and the Hollow. 

After a while, I started listening to a lot of Jimmy Buffett and found more bands through Pandora - TDWP and Norma Jean. Since then, I've discovered more metalcore through Pandora and Spotify and then this subreddit, which opened a whole new world of metalcore for me. 

To this day, Jimmy Buffett is still one of my favorite artists."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","I started with Black Veil Brides/Asking Alexandria/Sleeping with Sirens about 4 years ago.  Today I listen to a lot of ERRA/Volumes among many other things.  But yea it seems my tastes get heavier as time progresses, although I still do appreciate the music that got me here in the first place.  It's kind of funny to go through my ""Purchased"" playlist in my iTunes and if I play it in order I can listen to how my music tastes have developed over the years."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","I started with [this fan song for a show I liked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9374Se3Ka0) at the time (this was mid 2013) and saw anthony fantano's review of Sempiternal which got me interested in the genre. I couldn't get into it at first, but the vocal glitches in Can You Feel My Heart kept me coming back and I eventually fell in love with The House of Wolves. After that I went to 4chan's music board and asked for some ""pussy"" metalcore rec's and people there told me to check out Misery Signals, Johnny Truant, Protest the Hero, Every Time I Die, He is Legend, Killswitch Engage, and Miss May I. The only one of these that really clicked right away was Every Time I Die, the song in particular they showed me was [Pigs is Pigs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6OXX2vcaZU). I ended up checking out hot topic's ""screamo"" and ""metal"" sections for stuff and got into Capture the Crown and Woe is Me, and because of a piece of fan art for the the same show I mentioned earlier I found Of Mice &amp; Men. And I mostly stuck with OM&amp;M, Woe is Me, CtC, BMTH, and Protest the Hero for a while until I found this sub. 

And late 2013 I tried to burn through as many metalcore albums as I could and ended up listening to ~100 of them. A couple in particular stuck, namely [Ends With a Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-_8nNnxWEQ), [RooM](https://roommetal.bandcamp.com/track/when-all-is-said-and-done), We Came as Romans, and blessthefall. 

After that I went on a short lived trancecore tangent and listened to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Greta Knights, Adam Kills Eve, and The Bunny the Bear. 

Once 2014 started I decided to get into deathcore, but not much clicked. But I heard Carnifex had a new album coming so I decided to marathon their stuff (I had only heard Hell Chose Me at that point) and The Diseased and the Poisoned really clicked, which opened up the metal side of the genre. 

I decided to give the more popular bands a listen again after about 6 or 7 months into last year trying to discover better stuff in the ""underground"" and had both Killswitch and AILD blow me away. Which has been leading me into melodeath. 

I still enjoy some of the stuff I listened to at first, like OM&amp;M, WCAR, BMTh, and blessthefall. 

Earlier on when I was first into metalcore, and first found out what breakdowns were I despised them. They've grown on me a bit since then. I still don't like them like most people here seem to, but I don't find myself disgusted by them either. "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","I can't believe you asked for pussy metalcore and that they gave you every time I die."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","One guy offered me deathcore.

The closest thing to ""pussy"" metalcore any of them gave me was Miss May I (the album At Heart specifically) and someone said Misery Signals was the best ""pussy"" metalcore there was. 

I'm kind of glad though, because by ""pussy"" metalcore I think I meant post hardcore. "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Well you are here now, that's the important thing haha able to partake on /r/metalcore "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Yep. This sub is why I stuck around on reddit."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Same but I also discuss on /r/metal  /r/hardcore /r/posthardcore and occasionally /r/letstalkmusic all good places if like those genres or stuff similar."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","I use other subs as well, namely /r/lewronggeneration /r/tumblrinaction and /r/metal. "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","I'm subbed to le wrong generation its pretty funny just I'm to scared to comment as I know I will say something stupid haha"
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","I used to listen to Sepultura, Pantera, Metallica, etc. Then in 2009 I discovered Bullet For My Valentine, which was the band that introduced me into metalcore, so I started listening to the popular bands at that time (BMTH, AA, AA!). Got bored, discovered August Burns Red and Parkway Drive, because of Parkway I would listen more to hardcore bands than metalcore. Northlane's Singularity came out and I loved the sound. Because of Northlane's sound and my undying love for Misery Signals, I was introduced to bands that I listen to a lot lately, like The Contortionist, Animals as Leaders, Volumes and stuff. I can see a progression in my musical taste, and I'm stoked to know what I'm going to listen in the future."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Blink-182/yellowcard/taking back sunday/Brand New to Senses Fail/The Used/Silverstein/Emery/Chiodos to Asking Alexandria/Attack attack/Memphis MayFire to Stick To Your Guns/The Ghost Inside to  After The Burial/Periphery/As I Lay Dying/Parkway Drive/A Plea for Purging and currently im into the swancore movement. Sianvar is really tickling my fancy right now. Ive been going towards bands with technical instruments and less screaming."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Asking alexandrias stepped up and scratched from when I used to listen to more electro stuff years ago, then AAs other albums. Then a few sleeping with sirens, escape the fate and attack attack before finding parkway drive, breakdown of sanity and bury tomorrow which I've loved since and expanded out to more melodeath stuff like amon amarth. "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Linkin Park-Breaking Benjamin-Avenged Sevenfold-Killswitch Engage-All That Remains-As I Lay Dying-Of Mice and Men-Volumes

Once I started listening to AILD, I was pretty set in my heavy ways and started listening to a lot of different metal/metalcore.  It's funny cause I used to hate screaming, it made me so uncomfortable. But I got used to it in the few songs I liked that had it, and eventually grew to like it."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","For me, it started with allll Christian stuff. Underoath led to some alt-rock ""harder"" Christian bands like Spoken, Disciple, Red, ect. Underoath was as heavy as it got for a time (mostly 6-7th grade), then my friend bought me Demon Hunter's ""Storm the Gates of Hell"" and I was like ""br00tal"". This led to more DH, AILD, The Devil Wears Prada, For Today, August Burns Red, Norma Jean, ect. Growing up in Des Moines, I then started getting a Slipknot phase, and I sorta expanded out of the Christian music scene. I then started listening to ""scene-y"" bands like Alesana, WCAR &amp; Attack Attack. That was all in 9th grade, and starting around my sophomore year I got really into the scene and started listening to some Deathcore and Hardcore too (The Ghost Inside, Chelsea Grin, Suicide Silence). And I've basically stayed stagnant there since then. The whole djent thing started and I obviously like some of those bands a lot (IHW, Northlane, Invent Animate, newer Periphery). I just found that as I got older I found myself in more ""moods"". When I was younger, it didn't matter what I was listening to, I just would spin whatever I wanted. Now, I'll be more like ""I want some heavy as balls breakdowns"" or ""something softer"" (I really enjoy pop-punk music too, like the wonder years, story so far, mayday parade ect). I'm a sophmore in college now, and my parents occasionally ask me if I still listen to the ""screamy music"". They thought it would just be a phase, but so far they've been wrong. "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Used to despise anything resembling metalcore in high school. I listened to Audioslave, RATM, Foo Fighters, Saliva, stuff like that. While that music is still good, I find myself rarely revisiting. It just seems lacking in energy and a bit formulaic. 

My first exposure was my freshman year in college. Living in my fraternity I had some friends convince me to listen to some new stuff. I thing it started with We Came As Romans, ADTR, AILD, ABR, and some others. I really enjoyed it now for some reason, not sure why I blocked all that out earlier. Now a senior in college, it is basically all I listen to along with the occasional EDM stuff.

Those bands, and Spotify premium, really allowed me to explore the genre. I also like that the concerts are way easier to attend, cheaper, and more frequent in areas close to me."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","I started listening to more and more music going into seventh grade. For the next couple years I never really had any particular genre I liked and I would just listen to whatever sounded good to me. I ended up stumbling upon Paramore, and that was the first band I got *really* into, then into the kind of alternative genre. Then my high school sweetheart at the time introduced me to Three Days Grace, her favorite song being Riot. Later I found Disturbed, then a bit of Slipknot. A friend of mine from New Mexico introduced me to Escape the Fate - Situations (seems like that's everyone's introduction song into EtF). Fast forward another couple years I'm dating a girl who listened to stuff like Sleeping with Sirens, Pierce the Veil, and a bit of Bring Me The Horizon, Asking Alexandria, Woe is Me, Of Mice &amp; Men. I ended up being more interested into the second bit of that list, mostly BMTH. Through them I kind of fell into the genre finding things from all flavors like Attack Attack! Get Scared, Crown the Empire, I See Stars!, Memphis May Fire, Miss May I, and Beartooth. "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","I always listened to The Used and ADTR and randomly listened to Demon Hunter for a year my freshmen year of high school, but I went to see Hollywood Undead my senior year and they were playing with D.R.U.G.S., WCAR, Asking Alexandria, and Borgore (but that led me to my dubstep phase). I thought WCAR was okay, but loved D.R.U.G.S. and Asking Alexandria. 

Saw LMTF with D.R.U.G.S. later on and then delved super intense into genericore for warped tour that summer (MMF, started loving WCAR, etc.)

It's been about three years since then and I've been refining my taste ever since. I enjoy some genericore like Secrets and old MMF, but not too often. I dig the instrumentation and ""chugga chugga, breakdown"" doesn't do it for me anymore. Love me some ETID, Enter Shikari, Periphery, and Swancore these days, but I also love occasional pop music, reggae, indie, and just chiller stuff in general.

To put it candidly, I dig some bullshit music if I'm feeling lighthearted, but I always encourage real authentic music. Also, there needs to be some form of melody. I hate music that's just chugs and screams with nothing to attach to."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","I used to listen to Nickelback, 3 Doors Down, 3 Days Grace, Papa Roach, Audioslave, Soundgarden until about 2011. I did enjoy songs like ""Hand of Blood"" by BFMV or ""Nothing Left"" by AILD since 2008 but I never really digged the genre at the time. So until mid-2011, I only listened BFMV and KSE in terms of Metalcore. 

In 2012, I discovered and listen a lot to Asking Alexandria, blessthefall and Falling In Reverse.

In 2013, I took the first big step towards the love of Metalcore when I discovered Northlane, Novelists, OM&amp;M, TWA, MMF, Issues and a few others.

By mid-2014, I only listened to Metalcore after having discovered this subreddit and with it hundreds of bands (to name a few: TAA, Attila, BTM, Bury Tomorrow, TCM, ERRA, I See Stars, IHW, 'Invent, Animate', Misery Signals, Volumes). My interests also reached genres like Deathcore and Melodic Hardcore.

During august 2014, I went to my first concert ever (at the age of 21), [saw ADTR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osEYVYKq0mA) and wanted more the second it ended. Since then, I also went to a concert featuring Asking Alexandria, Crown The Empire, TGI and Secrets then I went to see my favorite band Northlane (between the time I got the tickets and the actual concert Adrian had been replaced by Marcus) along with PWD, HSB and Carnifex.

Over the years, my taste definitely got heavier and heavier. Years ago, I hardly enjoyed screaming and now I pay more attention to it than cleans. This music genre really helps me feel complete."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Man, most people here started with Bullet. I never got into them. I liked some of their songs but never really listened anything but the popular ones. 

My dad listened to hard rock/metal, so I always liked it, but the band that got me into music was Breaking Benjamin. I remember playing Halo 2 as a kid and their song ""Blow Me Away"" starting up at the end of one of the levels. Got hooked. Started looking up other songs by them and then quickly became addicted. From their I moved onto other hard rock bands like Three Days Grace, Chevelle, newer A7X, etc. anything that had a little bit of screaming every once and awhile basically. 

Then, I heard ""People = Shit"" by Slipknot back in 2011. That song changed my life. I became hooked on Slipknot. They are the band that got me into full on screaming. From their my tastes started getting heavier. I started listening to Post-hardcore stuff like Escape the Fate and Falling in Reverse around summer 2012, and then I saw FIR around November of that year, so I guess that was my first show of the genre. (Enter Shikari and letlive. opened up) But I listened to Zombie EP by Prada a lot that summer too, even though I couldn't get into their other stuff for some reason at the time. So that was my first metalcore album I feel in love with. 

Then my first showed me I See Stars around Christmas. I was hooked on it. I saw them two months later in February, with a bunch of other metalcore bands. So that was my first real metalcore show, and then a few weeks later my friend invited me to go to this festival here in Texas called ""South By So What?!"" last minute. Figured what the hell. That day got me hooked on everything metalcore. I discovered Memphis May Fire, Bring me the Horizon, older prada stuff etc. from their my taste have just gotten more and more metalcore. 

I've been listening to a lot of Silent Planet, Architects, and Northlane recently. "
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Great story, man! Yeah, Northlane is actually my favorite band by FAR and I really have been listening to Architects a lot lately. LF:LT was such a great album. Also, I just discovered Silent Planet about a month ago and I have fallen in love with them. Christian or not, Garrett writes some great material. And yeah I actually live in Denton (around Dallas) so I'm familiar of South By So What. Might be going again this year."
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Dude, that's sick! SBSW is such a fun time. I've gone to every one since my first, and I'm for sure going to day 2 and day 3 this year. Gotta see Silent Planet ;)"
"What was your Metalcore journey like?","I'm gonna be going to day 3 for sure. Gotta see Invent, Animate. I know all the guys and they happen to be one of my favorite bands. "

"What was your Metalcore journey like?","Ummmm.... probably started with underoath, they were on a christian mix CD i had gotten for christmas in.... 2005 I think. Then it dropped off, went to bring me the horizon, Atreyu and AA when I hit my senior year in HS, then went onto OM&amp;M, and the rest has pretty much upscaled since then."

"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","I saw them at warped tour last year and i fucked up at the line:
""I don't know about you but I'm admitting now that I have a problem""
I finished like 1 second before everyone else and fucked up the moment. :("
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Been there too, brother. My palm-to-face moment was during Warped Tour 2007, Parkway Drive performing Picture Perfect Pathetic when Winston screams ""Lifeless!"". I screamed way too early on it. Winston shook his head and smiled."
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","At warped tour in 2010 I clapped during the wrong time of ""Sorry You're Not a Winner"" during Enter Shikari. "
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","That's unforgivable, how did you even manage that? Haha "
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Mini story!  
I was at one of Shikari's first ever shows, nobody knew to do the *clap-clap-clap* bit so the band did it themselves. I distinctly remember saying to my friend ""That's so fucking stupid, it will *never* catch on"".  

I was a moron."
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","I was pretty new to the band. My friends still made sure everyone around us knew I was ""that asshole"". It still comes up every now and then."
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Kicks the crap out of nearly everything on Disgusting. "
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Everything from the Sick EP does"
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Yep. This song was so good, they had to include it on both. "
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Definitely, and it makes Disgusting a lot better than it would be otherwise"
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","I liked Disgusting better."
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Good for you"
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","You state your own opinion, and then act like an asshole when someone disagrees. Classy."
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","I didn't mean that in an asshole-ish way, sorry about that"
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Wow, I thought this sub liked Disgusting. I admit it wasn't as good as Sick but I still enjoyed it."
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","I enjoyed it as well, I was just very disappointed by it after how great Sick was"
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Yeah, everything on Disgusting is really subpar to Sick. The songs were just really boring, and weirdly enough'm. This was my least favorite song on Sick. I like Go Be The Voice way more, that bass breakdown... Mmmmmmm."
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","My father has been an alcoholic for over 14 years and used to verbally and physically abuse me when I was little. When Beartooth dropped Disgusting and I heard Beaten In Lips, and paired it with this song, the shit hit home HARD. One day he coerced me to take him to the liquor store in the next town over ( He has no car and his license is expired.) because I wanted to pick something up as well. On the way back I played this song and Beaten In Lips in my car quite loud. Halfway through this song he turned the radio down threw a hissy fit, but I'm glad it hit him as hard as it hit me. People may have their problems with this band, but Caleb is a fucking monster vocalist and he's better here than he was in Attack Attack. Fuck yeah. "
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","I'm two months sober as of yesterday; this song and ""Life is Hard Enough"" by Have Heart have really helped me in realizing that drinking just isn't for me anymore."

"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Holy piss from a sprinkler, I love this song and this entire EP. 

""Go Be The Voice"" is something I listen to almost every day.

"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Great song, definitely one of my favorites of theirs"
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","I personally didn't like Attack Attack! but Beartooth are sick."
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","I just remember the first time I heard this song. It was right after Caleb released it for the first time and my friend messaged me to listen to it. I remember sitting on my computer and pulling up the video and just that feeling of being smashed in the face came over me when this song it. Not too many experiences when a song had such a powerful punch the first time I listen to it. "
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Saw these guys open for August Burns Red two years ago. Weird lineup, though.

First you have Beartooth winning over a crowd with some sick mosh, then Defeater ruined the mood of the entire room by playing some depressing, inappropriate shit.

Luckily Blessthefall were next to restore the mood and bring the fun back, with ABR capping off the night and providing the sickest mosh.

Moral of the story: never seeing Defeater live again. Fuck that. "
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","No. Nope. 

Opposite for me, blesathefall was very meh while Defeater was one of the best live shows I've ever seen. See them if you can people. "
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","What makes Defeater inappropriate here? I get that they seem kind of out of place on the tour, but their music has a lot of heavy, mosh-worthy moments. It sounds like you already had some kind of preconceived notion that Defeater would be ""depressing, inappropriate shit""."
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","The pit went crazy for them at the date of that tour I was at"
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","I would go ham too. Sure, the lyrical content is a bit heavy-handed at times, but holy hell if they don't have some bangers in their repertoire."
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Definitely, also it was their hometown show"
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","Saw this tour too. Defeater were great, however, they had no place on that tour. Beartooth/ Defeater and ABR are close friends and ABR and Blessthefall are close friends so I bet it was such a bro tour to be on but Defeater should be touring with Citizen and Turnover not these super energetic bands. Hundredth or Counterparts would have been a solid replacement for Defeater imo. "
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","I went to that tour mainly for Defeater. Beartooth and ABR were just a nice bonus."
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","I went to that tour and actually only got a bad impression from Beartooth, not even because of the music though, just one of the guitarists being a douche to security who wasn't even doing anything wrong, just their normal job. I feel like that sort of plays a role in the back of my mind in why I haven't hopped on the hype train for them. Idk. I don't like seeing band members being assholes to people who don't deserve it.  I've listened to their stuff though, I don't hate it or anything. "
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","I went to that tour too and me and my friends felt the same way! pretty boring but at least they were passionate I give them that"
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","I went to the tour and enjoyed every band a lot, don't see the problem, that tour is actually what got me really into Defeater

Edit: Maybe it was just because it was their hometown show, but the crowd had a ton of energy when Defeater was playing"
"Beartooth - ""I Have a Problem""","It wasn't just me. Defeater's depressing as shit lyrics killed the mood of the entire venue. There were maybe 3 people really into them, everyone else was standing their crossarmed. Luckily BtF was next and had the whole place moshing and crowd surfing.

Must have just been a bad night for Defeater. I dunno. They definitely didn't win me over, though.

During their set the singer invited everyone over to hang out near the merchbooth after the show, saying that VIP packages are bullshit and that the way you get to interact with a band shouldn't be decided by how much money you have.

"Any pointers for my first real concert?","Well, nobody cares what you do honestly. They're there for the band. If you feel the energy hop in the pit(if you've never been in a pit, look up pit etiqeutte) 

If you want to mark out and sing along hit the front, but beware, you'll get pushed against the stage/barricade and it might hurt.

Watch out for stage divers and crowd surfers.

Really about it.

68 is REALLY fun live, I'm not a big BAAO or TAA fan, but I'm going to guess a lot of girls/people who aren't as crazy will be there. And STYG is fucking god tier live. Have fun!"
"Any pointers for my first real concert?","Thanks for the feedback man!"
"Any pointers for my first real concert?","you want to get to the venue early. like super early. somewhere around sound check is when the hardcore fans show up, so they can all impress each other by saying ""oooh sounds like they're playing _____ tonight"" or ""wow that is a new riff, we might hear something from their next album tonight.""

the guitarist, or at least the bassist, will come out at some point to smoke a cigarette. they will sign things for the hardcore fans, maybe answer some questions. this is your entry point. this is where you gush and get excited and make it very clear how ready you are to suck some dick. you may get invited backstage at this point, or to watch the show from backstage (this is unlikely though).

more likely is that they will flirt with you a bit but damn man, they got a job to do. but-- you made an impression and will be one of the first through the door. you take this opportunity to post up right in front of the guitar amps. then you flirt all show long, not over the top hollering stuff, but throw some sexy faces his way when he's doing crowd service. when he's soloing, he's not paying attention to you, he's busy. but when he's just chugging along, keeping it going for his bandmates while they go nuts, that's when he has time to pay attention to you and how excited you are to suck his dick.

it is after the concert his sound tech or security will be instructed to grab whoever and bring them backstage after the show. stick around at the front-- that's when the usual fans are asking for set lists and begging to be let back stage. either you will be asked if you did your job well, or you should ask the manager/ sound guys taking the stage apart. it's important you distinguish the venue's security and tech guys from the bands. it will be obvious. make sure to focus on the bands, the venue guys just want you gone so they can go home.

now, let's assume it hasn't happened yet. that's fine. you want to hang out wherever the band was around the sound check cigarette. it won't be the regular entrance/ exit, it will be on the side or back of the building. they are expecting this, as well, people asking them to sign stuff or want to share with them how important their music is and stuff. this is the most likely chance to get on the bus-- their job is over, they recognize your ""fuck me"" eyes from the show, they are headed to the bus and ready to blow off some steam. don't ask them to sign anything, just be there, hot, and ready.

i want to be clear-- if they don't invite you backstage at sound check, do not despair. if they don't have their security bring you back during/after the show, don't give up. most common and easiest is when they are leaving the venue, maybe 30 minutes after the show is over and 95% of the crowd is gone. this is the groupie's time to shine.

also-- because i am assuming you have completed your task-- make it clear you have 0 obligations and would be happy to head to the next town with them. after you suck dick, not before, you don't want to appear cling-y. but to really be a groupie, you need to get on that bus to the next town. do your thing well and make it clear you're open to leavingt with them the next morning. once you are on the bus off to yuma or ... bakersfield, then you are truly a groupie.

be safe out there sister.

"Any pointers for my first real concert?","If you mosh or stage dive or do something active, make sure to drink LOTS of water otherwise you will likely get quite dehydrated and possibly pass out and if you take your phone find a safe place to store if you mosh or stage dive as you could likely lose it or it'd get destroyed. That being said at my local gigs I keep it in my pocket, but if you have a back up / bad phone you could use that so it doesn't get destroyed"

"Any pointers for my first real concert?","if you don't have to take your phone thats better but quite often that can't happen"
"Any pointers for my first real concert?","If you stand near the pit, you are going to get hit. It's not a maybe, it is a fact. Usually it's accidental, sometimes it's intentional. It's okay. Don't hit back, even if it's on purpose. Typically anyone who goes out of their way to hit someone intentionally is affiliated with a local crew and him and his ass-hole friends will beat the shit out of you if you fight back. Just let it go, or stay away from the pit. Security usually will keep you safe at most decent venues."

"Any pointers for my first real concert?","STYG is absolutely amazing live, so good pick! For the tips make sure you have tied your shies properly if you go into the pit, and watch out for stage divers, and lastely the pit get much more intense with the main act so don't go into the pit on the first song of the main/big band, the itensity might catch you by suprise.

Besides that just have fun dude :)"

"What makes a good band name?","I am releasing an EP sometime within the coming months, &amp; im kind of stuck at a name. I have some ideas, but I'd like to hear your guys thoughts on the topic! "
"What makes a good band name?","Not sure if this is useful or not, but stuff that's just totally out of left field usually sticks. Stuff that makes you ask ""why is it that?"" makes you interested in looking into other stuff. 

Think of like, Born of Osiris. That name sticks because it's an oddity. What is it that's born of Osiris? Why an Egyptian death god specifically? 

But that's just what makes a name stand out to me. "

"What makes a good band name?","Avoid names with a generic format, like ""verb the noun"", ""I, the noun"", ""___ of the ____"". I think you guys did good with the name Sirens &amp; Sailors. It's simple, easy to remember, and has a cool meaning behind it. Ultimately it comes down to whether or not the music you make is good and not the name (which I'm sure you'll have no problem with).

If you don't mind me asking, whats your new EP going to be like? Is it just you working on it or is it with other members of S&amp;S? Regardless I'll be sure to check it out!"

"What makes a good band name?","I am a big fan of monepic band names, that is, bands like Emmure, Adestria, Alesana and Periphery. The multiple syllables gives it definition but it's not too long so it's not a mouth full e.g. Fear Before The March of Flames, And You will Know Us By The Trail Of Blood. I feel a solid 5-6 syllables is the maximum amount and band name should be. SI-RENS AND SAIL-ORS, MY CHIL-DREN MY BRIDE, THE DE-VIL WEARS PRA-DA, you get the point.

Obviously the whole Verb the Noun has been run into the ground be now and should be avoided. There are good ones out there, but again it's just over played.

Tacky and flashy names always just rub me the wrong way, too, like Lions!TigersBears!, Feed Her To The Sharks, A Bullet For a Pretty Boy, Shreddy Kruger.

The title should really try to reflect the music the band produces as well, I think deathcore bands do this the best like Thy Art Is Murder, Rings of Saturn and Suicide Silence"

Jk, I tend to like band names that reference books--As I Lay Dying,  The Devil Wears Prada, Ice Nine Kills, etc. So find a cool book and find a cool reference from it."

"What makes a good band name?","I think there's hardly any good names, make sure to stay away from verb the noun or an adjective then a noun. I think one word names are pretty awesome, but it needs to stand out or a few words that have flow/saying.

"What makes a good band name?","I'll probably get flammed for this, but I think Suicide Silence is a terrible band, like imagine saying you like that to someone or at a music store and you mention that, it just gives off such a scene vibe. It's for like everything that has a death related topic in the title, when I asked about Every Time I Die if they had any of their stuff, and I just felt like they thought I listened to terrible music."

"What makes a good band name?","Verb the Noun"
"What makes a good band name?","Uniqueness is key, no generic verb the noun formats. Not more than 5-6 syllables, even that is pushing it. One word names are a safe bet as long as, again, they're unique. Not generic sounding stuff like horizons, visions, voices, perception, issues. Think more along the lines of underoath, oh sleeper, oceans ate alaska, breakdown of sanity, glass cloud, crossfaith, northlane, and ice nine kills. They all easily roll off the tongue, and they're unique enough that the the name stands out and sticks with you. Bonus points if it actually has some kind of deeper meaning, or at least seems like it does."
"What makes a good band name?","I agree with band name needing to be unique. I will also add make sure no other band is using that name already (check google/last fm to see if bands names not already taken) if so then it's not yours to use. Nothing worse than trying to Check out a particular bands music online/spotify only to have to go though music of multiple bands at the same time. "

"Songs with ""orchestral-sounding"" music?","First off, I don't get much of  an ""orchestral"" vibe from that song, but more like an anthem song. Honestly, if you like that sound you should check out My Chemical Romance's album The Black Parade, because it's full of anthem-y songs like this. 

Second, while nothing like the song you used as an example, Between the Buried and Me's music has always had a classical/orchestral sound to it in my opinion.  I think this song is a good example: http://youtu.be/AhtKu8gVE2c

"Throw back Thursday! Avenged Sevenfold - Second Heartbeat","My friend, there is no such thing as ""unnecessary notes"" when syn solos."
"Throw back Thursday! Avenged Sevenfold - Second Heartbeat","Don't get me wrong, I think Syn is a fairly talented guitarist, but you can definitely tell that he added in random phrases in the beginning of the guitar solo just for the sake of adding random phrases in a guitar solo. The solo in the demo just fits more imo"
"Throw back Thursday! Avenged Sevenfold - Second Heartbeat","fairly talented?"
"Throw back Thursday! Avenged Sevenfold - Second Heartbeat","When guitarists like Luke Hoskin, Paul Waggoner, Tosin Abasi, Jason Richardson, Misha Mansoor, and John Petrucci exist, it's pretty hard to say Syn is anything more than ""fairly talented."" Obviously if you think otherwise, to each their own"
"Throw back Thursday! Avenged Sevenfold - Second Heartbeat","Aj Minette, David Davidson, Sithu Aye, Christian Münzner, Yngwie Malmsteen, the list goes on"
"Throw back Thursday! Avenged Sevenfold - Second Heartbeat","To be fair, many of those guitarists strive to make technically impressive riffs/songs. The members of A7x don't give two shits about making technically impressive material. They only care about the songwriting. The only time Syn may actually try to show off any sort of technicality is during the solos, and even then its to compliment the song, not show off his technical skill"
"Throw back Thursday! Avenged Sevenfold - Second Heartbeat","It's not like bands like Between the Buried and Me, Protest the Hero, Periphery, and Dream Theater totally focus on guitar wankery and completely throw any sense of songwriting out the window. If you want to hear technically impressive guitar work that's complete devoid of original songwriting, try something like Dragonforce. If you want to hear impressive songwriting that's accompanied by technically impressive guitar work, try Skies by Protest the Hero, Luck as a Constant by Periphery, basically anything by BTBAM (I personally love Prequel to the Sequel, but any song of theirs will prove my point), anything by Animals as Leaders, or Octavarium by Dream Theater. All of those bands put A7X to shame in literally every conceivable aspect.

I'm not attacking you or telling you your opinion is invalid. Just want to justify what I said in my other comment, that's all :)"
"Throw back Thursday! Avenged Sevenfold - Second Heartbeat","Oh don't get me wrong, I think all of those bands make great songs. I was just pointing out that A7x, with the exception of a few solos or drum fills, has never been a band that is interested in being all that technical, even though they are more than capable of being so. I don't mean to downplay any of the other bands, I just felt the need to point out that all of the members of A7x are far more technically skilled than they let on.

And same to you :)"
"Throw back Thursday! Avenged Sevenfold - Second Heartbeat","I like them both, and considering I find Syn to have better phrasing than pretty much any other guitarist that is in a band, the more notes the better :p"
"Throw back Thursday! Avenged Sevenfold - Second Heartbeat","I don't think syn is overrated but I don't think he is the best or worship the ground they walk on. I think he earns his place in my top 20"
"Throw back Thursday! Avenged Sevenfold - Second Heartbeat","My comment wasn't directed at you. Just the people who downvote me for having any sort of criticism towards a guitarist who is overrated in my opinion. Obviously if you like him then that's totally cool, like I said before, to each their own

Edit: Huge mistake. I accidentally wrote ""was"" instead of ""wasn't"""
"Throw back Thursday! Avenged Sevenfold - Second Heartbeat","Man your comment is being misinterpreted and unfairly blown up.  I totally agree, you're spot on.  Longtime fan of A7X, the Demo is simply more raw, more energetic, less sterile--notably the vocals and solo, and it's got that punk/metal hybrid vibe which they had in their early stages.  Doesn't take away from the fact that this is a good song regardless"

"Question about Joel Birch screaming (+ plz halp)","Okay, I'm REALLY trying to do ""Pabst Blue Ribbon on Ice"" for my girl (Joel's parts; my much more talented friend will do Ahren's cleans) and Joel's voice doesn't seem possible, especially with the increasing disparity between the studio and live versions of songs. (There is no live version of PBR for whatever reason) 

Basically, what I'm asking is if I should compare myself to his studio level (sometimes I get close; most times I sound like old Mike Crafter shit from IKTPQ), because I'm really frustrated.

Thoughts? Tips? Positive reinforcement? Anything?"
"Question about Joel Birch screaming (+ plz halp)","Add some distortion to your screams and compress them. Also make sure you layer them. Do two takes, add the distortion and compression, see if it sounds any closer. All the vox for that band are heavily edited. "
"Question about Joel Birch screaming (+ plz halp)","Oh, definitely, especially Ahren's. Thanks mate. "
"Question about Joel Birch screaming (+ plz halp)","I'd say just don't try to mimic his screams. It'll still sound good with your own style, as long as you can pull THAT off."
"Question about Joel Birch screaming (+ plz halp)","Thanks :) I actually did ""Chasing Ghosts"" the other day, which is less distorted than PBR and more straight up forceful aggro. When I get my throat warmed up after a minute or two it's substantially easier to listen to. 

If I get my clean-singing friend to help this weekend, I'll see if anyone wants to hear it here."

Here's my clip. You seem FAR more experienced than myself, so any pointers beyond the stuff I talk about in the description would be extremely appreciated."
"Question about Joel Birch screaming (+ plz halp)","I'm not actually all that experienced. I'm just basing it off of what I've seen/heard. Joel live sounds like high false chord screams, like what youre doing, but on the album it sounds more like low fry screams. When I scream along I do the low fries. But my advice for you is, mainly, just use your diaphragm more. I know you've probably heard that a billion times from everyone ever. But just practice pushing more and getting better volume. I feel like with better volume you'll notice your screams sounding better. I scream in the car about every other day, and that seems to work out well for me, so I suggest you do that too. Youre free to be as loud as you need to be. I don't do it every day so I give my vocal chords a chance to rest. But I will sing on the off days, to stay in practice, and also cuz it's fucking fun. 
Also drink water. Like drink two glasses when you get up in the morning. Drink two with meals. Drink one or a bottle when you scream. It's more important than youd think."
"Question about Joel Birch screaming (+ plz halp)","As have I, but I also heard the contrary. I don't think he'd be around this long if he did inhales, either. "

I'm about to be 23 so I was just getting into this genre of music around the time I was 13-14 and bands like Underoath, TDWP, PWD, etc. were really starting to get big. Still Remains was among these and then after their last album (The Serpent I think) came out, they just dismembered? anyone know the backstory or can further explain to me what happened?

"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","being straight edge for 4 years, having multiple edge tattoos, ive never once punched someone for smoking pot and ive been around crews who have seen people dealing drugs at shows and they did nothing. Really not fair to generalize people"
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","Settle down, I'm not blaming straightedge. I was Edge for 5 years and I was the same as you, just a non-participant in substance abuse. A lot of crews are unaffiliated with sXe, and are just made up of douche bags, but the most common grouping  of people who will start fights at shows over drugs are edge. I've seen this first hand in many cities on tour. It sucks seeing a good cause get misrepresented."

But I'm not about to get into a dick measuring contest with a 15 year old over this so if you wanna 420 blaze it in the pit then have at it."
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","Nah it's fine. Its to be expected at a concert. That's like saying you don't like the smell of sweat or beer at a concert. Sure it might be unpleasant, but it's an unavoidable part of it. I say just be chill about it, let people do what they want."
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","Yeah, I'm not cool with it. Not because I'm not cool with weed, do whatever you want in your own time and space, but not in a public sphere. I just think it should be courtesy for people not to. Outdoors its more understandable, because the air is open and the wind can carry it off, but even then I'd rather not have this 16 year old lighting up right in front of me as I'm trying to watch someone. "
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","Yeah sorry. I'd rather not inhale smoke from people reeking of weed. It's annoying, and I'd rather not get a 3rd hand high. And it's not the same as sweat or beer. Are you kidding? Excuse me while I sweat in a close quarter room, with a bunch of people who are all there do do the same thing while my body *naturally* releases liquid to cool itself. If you smoke, smoke outside before you come in, don't smoke in the crowd. I'm sure you can live without your precious plant for a few hours. You have no reason to smoke in the crowd except to somehow try and look cool in front of a bunch of 16 year olds."

Edit: I'm not bashing pot, I'm bashing the idea that lighting any type of flame in a roofed off building is a good idea. Thanks for the downvotes"
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","I don't think there's anything unsafe to me about other people smoking pot. They're usually pretty discreet about it anyway. And then I don't really give a shit about the legality of it or whatever."

"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","With the right weed there will definitely be someone massively blazed."
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","No offense but I'm not sure you understand how smoking works. There's not like an open flame. It's not a torch, it's a cigarette, pretty much, if we're talking about joints. And more people are gonna be holding up lighters in appreciation of a song, than people blazing up."
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","A quick search on google gives plenty of examples of fires caused by cigarettes, especially if youre putting it in a bin."
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","There will always be smoking at a concert, regardless of the type of music and where it's at. Some venues don't seem to care much, others are really strict about it. I was at Best Buy theater in NYC a while back and they had a few security guards in the pit that were picking people out of the crowd and tossing them out for smoking. It basically comes down to insurance and liability purposes at that venue. To specifically answer your question: people typically smoke during the stage set-up or they'll do it back away from the pit since there's way too much going on to be able to actually light up. My advice: just do it outside in your car before the show, that way you don't have much to worry about, you won't have to worry about your pipe/joint/etc. getting ruined. "
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","The only times I've smoked at a show have been at Warped Tour where we're always outside where the smell and smoke can dissipate easier and it doesn't bother others too much. Most of the time I smoked before the show with the bands "
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","At my stop of the Frozen Flame in MN there were definitely a few people smoking pot, lots of vaping(not sure about spelling?) and drinking for sure though. "
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","I was there. I swear the room reeked like pot as soon as Miss May I came on stage... I thought it was them who brought the smell haha"
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","You can at some I guess by reading these comments but I got kicked out for doing that. It's expected but I guess not allowed."
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","Yea, I do.  Typically it's alright, usually just get hungry stares to pass it.  Only at a few warped tours did any kids give me trouble for it and they quickly got swallowed by the crowd.  

It's definitely not as prevalent at metalcore concerts as it is others, but it still happens."
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","people smoke pot everywhere. Hell at Holly Springs reunion the band was smoking joints on stage, and luckily some good samaritan passes me one :D  "
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","I've done it on the floor of an Asking Alexandria show. personally, I wouldn't recommend it because it brings you to a mellow state of mind but you've got all this commotion going on around you. they're both great, just not together"
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","Warped tour last year is really the only show where I've done it, since most of the time it's so chaotic that it doesn't really work well. At Warped tour though, all of the bands I liked had already played, so I just smoked with my friends and watched Attila, I think that was the only time I slightly enjoyed them"
"Do people smoke pot metalcore concerts?","Definitely, joints were being passed around at a Killswitch concert in Grand Rapids."

"Best song to showcase Metalcore as a genre?","If what you mean is not ""the best"" or ""most acclaimed"", but something thats slightly generic, and well-embodies/describes the genre, I would go with something off of Bring Me The Horizon's Suicide Season.

"Someone please explain this to me...","What is the point of the upcoming OM&amp;M Restoring Force reissue ""Full Circle""? Apart from a couple of new songs and an acoustic song, what's the point? Please no OM&amp;M hate, I simply want to know why rerelease it?"
"Someone please explain this to me...","[Yea, I have no idea why they would do that](http://www.meridianpeakhypnosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/money-addiction.jpg)"
"Someone please explain this to me...","/thread"
"Someone please explain this to me...","Seriously, they want to make fucking money. There's nothing more to it. They know their...er...rabid fanbase will buy it, so why wouldn't they make it?"
"Someone please explain this to me...","Rise is in the business of cushioning their pockets. They are notorious for pushing  re-issues and acoustic/remix bonus material - especially if that certain band has increased their popularity. That is the case here, again.




The hidden genius behind this nonsense is that it's keeping bands focused and relevant in between album cycles and on tour. A necessary evil, in my opinion."
"Someone please explain this to me...","*cough* Issues-Diamond Dreams *cough*"
"Someone please explain this to me...","I remember even Tyler saying he didn't like the project himself and that they were, for the most part, forced to put it out. "
"Someone please explain this to me...","Really? Hm. I would think out of all the band members he would be the most gung-ho about an EP like that. "
"Someone please explain this to me...","Money. "
"Someone please explain this to me...","A more serious answer than money, they want to maintain their name, they want to make people remember who they are and not get bored listening to their music. Its why any band puts a deluxe version of their album out.
and also money "
"Someone please explain this to me...","But mostly money."
"Someone please explain this to me...","Another possible reason (and I don't know enough about OMAM or Rise's contracts to know if they have this built in or not, so here's to speculation) is that it can take up another album on your contract. When you sign a contract with a label typically you sign for x amount of albums. Remember all that hoopla with ADTR and Victory? It was because ADTR thought that their re-release of ""Homesick"" counted as a record toward their contract. Some bands are perfectly fine with putting out a ""Deluxe Edition"" because it fills up their contract faster. That way they can get either a better deal, move on to a new label, ect. Again, I don't know enough about OMAM's contract or how Rise does business but that could be the case. This is the one time I'll stand up for OMAM and say they might not be doing a cash grab haha "

"Any fun metalcore drinking games?","If you include chuggs it would be pretty much non stop drinking haha"
"Any fun metalcore drinking games?","Hmm this is quite interesting, ones for me that i could do in the future would be the obvious if there's a breakdown you drink (whatever you are doing it with) but then you could do some other stuff like you have to skull for the length of the breakdown or solo.

Or you could shuffle just Converge and you drink for whenever you can actually work out the lyrics haha that was a terrible idea i'm just thinking of stuff with bands that i like.

If they don't get started till July/August (which I highly doubt, because they'll probably do some summer tour.

I'm not the biggest BTBAM fan, but my understanding is that Tommy does all the vocals. So if I'm wrong in that thinking... oops, sorry."

"Tommy Giles most versatile vocalist?","I'd definitely agree with that"

"REVIEW: ""Restoring Force: Full Circle"" - Written for my college radio station","I felt that way because when first hearing Bones Exposed, it sounded so different that I feel like he just lost it"
"REVIEW: ""Restoring Force: Full Circle"" - Written for my college radio station","So I just listened to the performance he did with suicide silence and he can still scream.... I'm thinking they just sold out and want a bigger fan base "
"REVIEW: ""Restoring Force: Full Circle"" - Written for my college radio station","It's sad to accept it when they're one of the first bands that brought me deeper into the genres."
"REVIEW: ""Restoring Force: Full Circle"" - Written for my college radio station","Honestly I still feel like their first album was their best... The flood was good, don't get me wrong but for me nothing else they did compared to their first album "
"REVIEW: ""Restoring Force: Full Circle"" - Written for my college radio station","First album was easily the best, only the flood and the depths compete with it IMO"
"REVIEW: ""Restoring Force: Full Circle"" - Written for my college radio station","He just can't scream like his old screams live anymore. He can actually do whatever weird throat noise he makes now live. It sounds exactly the same ironically. But he can't do his old frys live anymore, and I feel that drove him to find a different vocal...""technique""(?)."

"REVIEW: ""Restoring Force: Full Circle"" - Written for my college radio station","Honestly, you explained how I felt but was too scared to say. I'm hugely disappointed in OM&amp;M. I was excited for their album, then they released ""Bones Exposed"" which gave me extremely high hopes but it all killed my buzz in my end. I still respect them but I mainly listen to their older albums"
"REVIEW: ""Restoring Force: Full Circle"" - Written for my college radio station","Austin can't scream anymore like he used to. The newer songs aren't great. Restoring Force wasn't necessarily all that bad in my opinion. Glass hearts and would you still be there are probably the best songs on that album. Us fans can complain all we want, but we should remember that at the end of the day it's the band's decision to make this kind of music or that kind of music."
"REVIEW: ""Restoring Force: Full Circle"" - Written for my college radio station","""If P.O.D. had an estranged child with Papa Roach it would be this song."" Yep that summarized pretty much every song on this album."

You can change the year at the top"
"Need some new stuff to listen to","Oh, man. Where do I start. For starters, check out the link /u/moshlyfe generously provided. What are three of your favourite metalcore bands?  "
"Need some new stuff to listen to","Uhh Top 3 Metalcore bands for me right now are probably Annisokay, Oceans Ate Alaska, and Monuments

Edit: That new INK single was fucking sick
"
"Need some new stuff to listen to","Check out More Than a Thousand's  two most recent albums. "
"Need some new stuff to listen to","INK is amazing, and i hate when other people say stuff like this, but I've been listening to Oceans Ate Alaska for years, since Clocks. Stoked for their new album! I was about to recommend Erra, but I saw your comment. Stuff like Glass Cloud, Volumes, and I second MTAT's newer stuff. "
"Need some new stuff to listen to","Just based on your flair, I'd say Erra would be a good band to listen to if you haven't checked them out yet"
"Need some new stuff to listen to","I tried Erra out. Maybe I didn't listen to it enough but I couldn't get into it. What would be a good starting point?
"
"Need some new stuff to listen to","Probably their newest EP, Moments of Clarity"
"Need some new stuff to listen to","Definitely Augment, Impulse, Moments of clarity. (in order)"
"Need some new stuff to listen to","Feed The Rhino"
"Need some new stuff to listen to","I personally find the side bar link to be outdated, many of those bands are inactive now, or their music is no longer available, or hard to find. Obviously a lot still is a very good place to start, but its not the one-in-all solution it used to be. 


I don't have any suggestions for bands, but I will list how I find more music.


* 1   I start with a band I like on youtube, and look through the suggested videos on the sidebar

* 2   I use spotify and look at similar artists and try one of the top few songs listed.

* 3   If some of the bands you like have a semi-well known label, check out their website. Its not a guarantee, but its better than nothing.

* 4   Pandora. Create a station with you absolute favorite artists and then be really really strict with the thumbs up and down button.

* 5   Bandcamp.com is pretty good for finding fledgling bands, especially djent at the moment. I have found a lot of stuff I've liked on there, and much of it is free if you are strapped for cash. 

* 6   I thought of another one, Facebook/Twitter. (My experience is with facebook because I don't use Twitter, but I imagine there is a similar feature) ""Like"" Monuments page, and what ever else you like, and you should start seeing suggestions for other pages to like in the sidebar. There's currently some drama happening over the way Facebook handles their pages, so you may want to stick to Twitter for this one.



Happy Hunting!

They also got a new drummer and guitar player/singer, so the albums sound somewhat different from each other. To sum it up, they're both great, I just happen to be rockin Dear G-d... lately"

"ANNISOKAY - Carry Me Away (New Video)","my thoughts exactly"
"ANNISOKAY - Carry Me Away (New Video)","Seeing them on Saturday in Wiesbaden got two tickets but no company. Originally bought the ticket to give it to whoever who comes with me for free. 

But somehow most people are busy with valentines stuff or birthdays."

"ANNISOKAY - Carry Me Away (New Video)","I like how bands who arent native English speakers have a irregular cadence. Breakdown of Sanity is pretty notable for it.

Its unintentional, but its a cool effect and gives them a unique sound."

"ANNISOKAY - Carry Me Away (New Video)","theyre on the edge, but /r/posthardcore is more for fans of bands like Emarosa who play a completely different version of Post Hardcore, so I thought more people here would enjoy them and their whatevercore (very generic) :)"

"ANNISOKAY - Carry Me Away (New Video)","I remember discovering these guys because of their Lady Gaga cover. As with most ""post-hardcore"" bands that do covers, I didn't listen to them much except for the cover every once in awhile. Cookie-cutter bands do covers all the time and never amount to much more.

Pleasantly surprised to see these guys not only upped the production quality of their music, but they also upped the quality of the songwriting itself. Good stuff"

"Last Year's Tragedy - Generation Light (Official Video) Metalcore from Nairobi.","Dude I love this for so many reasons. First of all there is a scene in Kenya and that is something I never imagined there would be.

Second of all this totally reminds me of how bands used to be where I live circa 08/09. Catching the train to places two hours away to see bands just like this with a bunch of friends from high school every weekend, this sends me on a massive nostalgia trip.

I love the style, no one plays stuff like this any more. Swirling strings as synth instead of just typical pop melodies like these days, just straight up chugs for breakdowns, no ""djent"" bullshit. tremolo picking with double kicks, old school cross picking in the verses, some one actually screaming on vocals instead of being worried about their ""inhale fries"" and ""gutteral lows"" or what ever the fuck

10/10 fuck yeah. "
"Last Year's Tragedy - Generation Light (Official Video) Metalcore from Nairobi.","That's funny- I'm fifty and a buddy of mine who I played in punk bands with BITD said to me, ""I bet playing there is just like it was back in 1980."" "
"Last Year's Tragedy - Generation Light (Official Video) Metalcore from Nairobi.","I would love to see how a show actually goes down there. I imagine it would be so far removed from anywhere with more developed ""core"" communities... or it is exactly the same and I'm just ignorant as fuck."
"Last Year's Tragedy - Generation Light (Official Video) Metalcore from Nairobi.","I have some friends down there (David Karuga from Last YEar's Tragedy being one of them) and they have a growing middle class in Nairobi, and I do know that guys from Uganda fly to Nairobi for skate contests- so that alone broke me out of my paradigm of where Nairobi is right now culturally. "

I just remember listening to their songs and thinking they were awfully preachy. I really like them, but sometimes they can ramble haha

EDIT: So I found this after doing a quick Google search: ""In the Hebrew Jewish culture, the name of God is respected in such an extent that it never is spelled out or spoken of. In order to get around this, most Jews usually write “G-d” instead of ‘God’, so that God’s name is never spelled out in it’s entirety on something that can be destroyed or thrown away. A pretty beautiful tradition, if you ask me. Albeit all band members are christians, the guys in Being As An Ocean pursued this tradition, and have named their 52-minute-long debut album Dear G-d….""

From: http://legendsarising.com/2012/10/18/review-being-as-an-ocean-dear-g-d/

So I guess they're Christian, but follow some other belief's traditions, too.

For the next few days we will have this nomination thread open. After that, a new final voting thread will be made to determine March's Artist of the Month.


This thread will be set to contest mode, which means that the scores will be hidden and each comment will be in a different order upon each refresh. Only moderators will be able to see comment scores.

"Oh, Sleeper - Hush Yael","Awesome song, even better when you read what it's about [here](http://honestreportingcanada.net/CBC/TheWorldShouldKnow.htm), it's pretty crazy but definitely adds a certain depth to the song."
"Oh, Sleeper - Hush Yael","COMPLETE GOOSEBUMPS EVERY TIME."
"Oh, Sleeper - Hush Yael","""End...him...slowww"" gives me goosebumps every single time."
"Oh, Sleeper - Hush Yael","I was at the show where they recorded this video. 

It was insane when Micah pulled the kid from the crowd and started screaming directly in his face. It was so cool. "
"Oh, Sleeper - Hush Yael","Man, I really I hope I get to see this guys live one more time, they put on an absolutely insane show."
"Oh, Sleeper - Hush Yael","This obviously is subjective, but I feel like this song is the definition of metalcore. A good mix of clean and dirty vocals, intelligible all the way through. It has good dynamics instrumentally and rhythmically. And the lyrics tell a good story. This song is so good all the way 'round."

"Oh, Sleeper - Hush Yael","I myself am not a big fan, but I love this song.



Edit: I listened to the album this is off of, and I actually really like them now. I didn't used to, but shit happens I guess."

"Comment found on a Capture the Crown video","Guitars have frets, they are what allow you to make the different notes, a lot of guitars in metalcore will have 24 frets. The joke is that the band only uses the first fret because they do nothing but chug on their guitars. "

"Adam Christianson made an official member of Architects","Very well deserved! I got to talk to Adam after their set opening for Ghost Inside and a Every Time I Die. Very nice guy."
"Adam Christianson made an official member of Architects","Greatest show i've ever been to. That was the show that got me into Architects. Fuck they are incredible live. 

Backtrack and Hundredth were really good, too. "
"Adam Christianson made an official member of Architects","Gotta agree on them being one of the best live bands, saw them at Reading Festival last year and the energy those guys generate on stage and amongst the crowd is insane. Jason from letlive. coming on stage as well solidified that as one of the top 3 live performances I have ever seen. "
"Adam Christianson made an official member of Architects","That Reading gig was fucking incredible, man. One of the best gigs I've ever been to, such an amazing atmosphere in that tent. SO pumped to see them at roundhouse next month."
"Adam Christianson made an official member of Architects","That tour in general looks amazing, Every Time I Die and Blessthefall on support too, couldn't really ask for more. Was gutted when I realised I couldn't make any of the dates near to me, enjoy it anyway! "
"Adam Christianson made an official member of Architects","The Reading performance was the greatest show I have ever seen out of the 100+ I've been too. I am unbelievably hyped for Roundhouse."
"Adam Christianson made an official member of Architects","Yeah, that show deserved the headline slot for The Pit. Not taking anything away from OM&amp;M but the Architects set was just on another level. That was an overall awesome day in The Pit now I think about it. "
"Adam Christianson made an official member of Architects","Counterparts are amazing too. It should be a great night."
"Adam Christianson made an official member of Architects","Looking forward to Roundhouse too, Counterparts only get 4 songs :( But it will be a great night as you say. "
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","Okay, okay, hear me out here. I used to think that many bands separated the harsh and clean vocals because maybe the harsh vocalist wasn't naturally a very good singer, and someone else in the band was. Makes sense. 

However, I've been attempting to learn to growl (it's going okay) and one of the interesting things I've learned is that a lot of proper screaming technique actually improves your singing as well, and vice-versa. In fact, I've improved more at singing than I have at growling. Now, I'm not going to go audition for The Voice or anything, but I think my singing is now good enough to do choruses and such in an extreme metal band. Which makes me wonder: guys who are much better screamers than me must also be better singers, because their technique is better. So why do many of them not sing at all?

The only other reason I could think of would be so that the singer and screamer can overlap each other, which is definitely musically interesting. However, many bands with separate screamers and singers rarely or never do this anyway. "
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","The thing is, that while I am sure that many of those screamers can sing as well, imagine them up on stage. They have to run around being the frontman, pump up the crowd, scream, and then switch directly over to singing. That takes a lot of energy, and that's how you get singers that sound like [Garrett Rapp](http://youtu.be/8qInQBCrKY8?t=33s).

Personally, I have nothing against clean vocals, but if you are gonna do both, you better make sure that you have the stamina to keep that up on stage. Of course Garrett Rapp is a very extreme example, and I know that there are guys out there who are beyond talented and can do both, but I have seen too many shows where half of the screams are pretty much just spoken, and half of the cleans are so horribly off key. "
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","Oh... oh my. 

That's a good point. I hadn't thought of that. "
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","Yeah that all being said, if you can do both I have some serious respect for you. Sooooo practice makes perfect? Good luck man. "
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","holy balls i got respect for Mr. Rapp for at least sticking through the performance, goddamn"
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","Yeah it was like watching a train wreck, the poor guy. Respect. "
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","I wonder how much his lackluster performance here has to do with his in-ear monitors. I'm not excusing his performance here, it is irrevocably bad. But some of it could have to do with problems with the PA. In addition, the audio in this video doesn't sound properly mixed. It sounds like it was taken directly from the soundboard, which may contribute to the quality of his vocals heard here."
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","I think it has to do more with sharing the load of vocal duties than anything else. I mean, most guys who scream and growl eventually ruin their vocal chords over the years. Imagine adding singing on top of that? Forget about it. 

Plus, not everyone can be [Mike Patton](http://youtu.be/1qAzdEXawM8)."
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","You only ruin your vocal chords if you do it wrong"
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","It's incredibly easy to do it wrong. It's not just the technique, it's also emotion. A lot of vocalists get carried away during their set which makes excessive screaming that much more destructive, even if they apply the right technique usually. "
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","Right, but there are plenty of vocalists who have been screaming for over 10 years, and their voices sound fine, so technique still has a big effect on it"
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","Oh definitely. The screaming itself if done with the right technique ultimately won't destroy your voice, but there are many other factors included that might. But still you'll also have vocalists like Corey Taylor that scream their lungs out for almost two decades and still have a voice in their forties. "
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","This exact rarity is why I have a lot of respect for individuals like Tommy Rogers and Matty Mullins. Matty might be a douchenozzle, but man he delivers live.

Do you have any recorded samples of your vocal prowess?"
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","I think Matty sings about 70% clean vocals in most songs ,but it sucks since I really like his screaming."
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","Not at the moment. I'm still really, really bad at screaming, haha. And my singing isn't anything special, either. I just think it's good enough for a band where singing isn't the main focus. "
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","Speaking as somebody who started out in musicals and choirs then became interested in Metalcore some notes in clean singing require ALOT of breath especially if it's higher more tenor range (which most cleans are) so I think the screaming would just wipe out your breath then trying to deliver a clean all while trying to perform and put on a show. I don't think some of the best vocalists in the world could deliver on it."
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","Because just because you can scream doesn't mean you can sing. Look at Alex from Atreyu. That fucker is one of the best screamers out there but him singing is like nails on a chalkboard. "
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","Not even really one of the best screamers anymore either, dude has no volume whatsoever. "
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","Because it's really, really, really fucking hard to do both"
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","I think some bands just don't want to have cleans. Look at August Burns Red, JB has mentioned many times in interviews that he doesn't think cleans would fit their style."
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","I think he's just talking about bands that have cleans, but have a different clean vocalist"
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","You're just figuring this out? I thought it was like a common thought that 90+% of unclean vocalists can't sing clean well. But it's also about the lung capacity aspect too."
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","82.4% of all statistics are made up on the spot. 90% is also a really big number, if you practice growls and screams with the right technique I feel it's ultimately beneficial for your abilities as a clean vocalist as well. At the end of the day your chords are still muscles that need exercise to become stronger, and you can exercise those muscles in multiple ways. "
"Why do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?","100% of the numbers that i'm not citing along with a source were pulled out of my ass for dramatic effect. A lot of unclean vocalists just plain cannot sing well. I'm not saying it's like a blanket effect thing that EVERYONE who screams cannot sing, but it's fairly uncommon to find an unclean vocalist who can also do cleans very well."

"ERRA - Warrior","Dat username doe"
"ERRA - Warrior","So many people say that to me hah, never gets old though."
"ERRA - Warrior","Saw them live last night. This was definitely one of their best songs!"
"ERRA - Warrior","Hey me too! AZ represent "
"ERRA - Warrior","Aw yiss. It was actually my first metalcore show, time to buy more tickets because I had a great time. "
"ERRA - Warrior","Oh wow, nice, glad you enjoyed your first one. I actually got really tired by the end on account of lack of sleep (I work nights), not to mention I got pretty fucked up in the pit during Northlane and Miss May I (lost half my glasses during Scarab, then got ran full force into by a dude 3x my size right in the stomach, wind knocked out of me during Masquerade, plus fending off the goddamn invisible ninja fighters) so by the end during ABR's set, I barely had the energy to jump haha. 

It was still an awesome show though, and yeah metalcore shows are usually a great time. Depending on what bands you see they tend to be better than that one; there were a lot more moshbros/metalheads there than usual, and less scene girls haha. Pretty sure I only saw girls in the pit for MMI and ABR lol. But yeah the Nile is like my favorite venue, its so fucking nice and its just small enough that you're never crowded and it can be air conditioned well and just big enough that the big name bands in this scene will still tour there. 

If I may suggest, TDWPs Zombie tour *and* Chelsea Grin's Ashes to Ashes tour are coming on the same day,March 25th. They're opening the Underground and holding both shows in one night, nine bands, tickets are $25. I've actually never been to a deathcore show so it should be fun, I'm buying my ticket as soon as I get paid lol.

Edit: fuck I need to stop using reddit when I'm high, sorry for the novel."
"ERRA - Warrior","Lol at your edit. I was basically there for ABR so I saved my energy for that, but MMI, ERRA and Fit for a King were really good for bands I didn't even listen to until the show. IMO northlane wasn't that great, I like their songs that are recorded but live I wasn't feelin it. 

But yeah I'm planning on TDWP, For Today, and ADTR for my next shows, they're all coming up recently. "
"ERRA - Warrior","Really? Northlane absolutely crushed it, I was impressed, especially with the new vocalist, he fucking killed. I felt Erra had kinda weak stage presence minus their bassist and front man, but I guess they were having trouble with the monitors on stage so whatever. Every band was great though, and I'm glad I went.

Well sick dude, I'll see you at some upcoming shows then. Well, not that I'll recognize you, but we'll be throwin down in the same room to the same music haha."
"ERRA - Warrior","Definitely the highlight off MoC. I really enjoy all of the other songs, but this has a certain ass-kicking element to it missing from the other tracks on the EP. Sort of like Hybrid Earth off Augment. "
"ERRA - Warrior","My fav. is Dreamcatcher, but this is deff. up there."
"ERRA - Warrior","Probably my favorite song by them"
"ERRA - Warrior","Erra is love"

"Help Me Contact Attila!","I tried to leave the title vague in the small chance my Redditor boyfriend sees this. 

In November of 2014 Attila (one of our favorite bands for years) had a signing at my local record store and my boyfriend and I went and hung out (it wasn't terribly busy) and talked to Attila. Chris Fronzak even found the store manager to ask him if they had any more copies of Guilty Pleasure as we couldn't find any to buy. My boyfriend bought a CD and had them sign it and we went to their show that night, it was overall a great experience. 

Unfortunately, less than two weeks later my boyfriend's car was stolen from my university (3 hours away from his home) and everything was taken. Floor mats, spare tire, loose change, trash, and the newly signed CD. Four days later it was found about 30 miles away with a smashed driver's side window and other minor damages.

I'm reaching out to /r/Metalcore because his birthday is coming up soon and I'd like to contact Attila (I haven't found a suitable method besides through their manager, which may end up being the best idea) to see if they would be interested in helping me make his birthday very special. 

If anyone would like proof, I can PM you pictures.

Thank you so much kind people, any help is appreciated!"

"Help Me Contact Attila!","I know, but both my boyfriend and I use Twitter. I decided to go here first before creating another Twitter account. Thank you! :)
"
"Help Me Contact Attila!","Just PM him and your boyfriend will never know!"
"Help Me Contact Attila!","She can only do that if Fronz is following her on twitter."
"Help Me Contact Attila!","Whoa, you're right. Never tried to PM someone who doesn't follow me."
"Help Me Contact Attila!","Just get int ouch with their manager. It would be the best chance of getting anything communication started. "
"Help Me Contact Attila!","I will probably end up doing that, just thought I'd post here first. :) Thank you!
"
"Help Me Contact Attila!","Tbh, theyre kind of assholes. Fronz especially. Warped last year my girlfriend and I wanted to meet him at his clothing tent, so we stopped in just to see what they had. Fronz saw that my girlfriend had a sharpie poking out of the pocket in her shorts and said ""Im not signing any autographs today unless you bought a ticket"" and tried to shoo us away. Ticket was $10... just for an autograph from a cheesy ass band member whose lyrics are so generic and has a failed rap album. Lost all respect for him and their band at that moment. She only had the sharpie in her pocket from Ice Nine Kills and The Word Alive meet and greet. Spencer from IX was probably the coolest dude there. Asked us how our day was and who our favorite bands were. Telle from TWA was pretty cool too. Shook my hand and made eye contact with every single person he talked to unlike Fronz who seemed like he was there just to sell shit and get back to the tour bus to smoke more weed. Good luck though!"
"Help Me Contact Attila!","""I lost respect for a band because the vocalist didn't fellate me.""

I hate this fucking scene so badly.

On topic, though; OP, contact their manager. The metalcore subreddit is about the worst place to go for contacting bands, as I doubt any of them but Christ Rubey from Devil Wears Prada actively browse here. Best of luck. "
"Help Me Contact Attila!","Thank you! :)"

"Help Me Contact Attila!","I'm sorry to hear that! We met them last summer at Warped as well, he seemed rushed but was very polite to us and we couldn't take pictures, which wasn't their choice. However when we met them at the signing (which was free) they took all the time to talk to us and sign whatever we wanted. Really nice, genuine guys from what we saw!"

"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?",""
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Sick &amp; Disgusting by Caleb and the Bearteeth is probably the easiest/first one that comes to mind. 

I enjoy Sempiternal by BMTH front to back on a regular basis, but I'm not too crazy about Crooked Young, and I sometimes skip it on my play throughs. 

The Poison by BFMV is an absolute classic but I really hate Cries in Vain. 

Maniacal Me off Crown the Empire's new CD is really bad on my ears, dunno why. 

We're Not in Kansas Anymore by I See Stars is the only song I ever skip on New Demons. 

That's all I got for metalcore. "
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Seconding Sick &amp; Disgusting. The crying makes me cringe.

Don't agree with Crooked Young though, it's one of my favourites of Sempiternal."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Yeah Crooked Young is so good "
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","I ended up just burning a version of Rise of the Runaways with Maniacal Me taken off just cause I hate it so much. It has a stupid auto tune voice in it plus they begin the song by smashing in with a really annoying guitar riff."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Haha love it. I should probably do the same!"
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","I think Antivist is much worse than Crooked Young."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","It must be the 14-15 year old still inside me that gets fired up too much at ""MIDDLE FINGERS UP"" for me not to enjoy that track. "
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","It's just pretty jarring that the rest of the album is kind of introspective and relatively deep then this song comes on and like you said, sounds like it's for 14 year olds."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","It's kinda the Football Season Is Over of Sempiternal"
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","I agree it is a bit out of place, but I don't mind it. Its one of my favorite ""pump-up"" songs for sure. "
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","What's wrong with Sick and Disgusting?"
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","I appreciate it for Caleb's emotion and lyrics, but its just too much for me to listen to. Ultimately, I just end up cringing in some parts and just get bored listening to it in other parts. "
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Oh okay, I gotcha. I personally love the song. But Keep Your American Dream on the other hand, it doesn't do it for me. "
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Why is that? Its catchy as hell and doesn't stray from the main tune of the album. I personally think its a great song. "
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","I don't really like the chorus of the song, I guess that's about it. It's the only song on the album I never stuck with. "
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Aw man Maniacal Me is my favorite from that album"
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Man Crooked Young is one of my favorites! It's got a big It Never Ends vibe to it."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Crooked Young is best if you think of it like the soundtrack to a movie. Definitely not the best song on the album though, I'll give you that."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","I usually skip Maniacal me and Second Heart or whatever that songs called. They kinda ruin the flow of the album to me and kinda bore me."

I don't really know why, but this song sticks out like a sore thumb. It just sounded weird to me even till today. The whole album is great, but this is the only song in the album that I don't mind skipping."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Really? I think that's actually one of my favorites from the album, I can't really stand Tear on the Runway though I don't like their tones in it I think."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","I loved Tears On The Runway. I'm hooked to that the whole week. To each his own i guess."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Yeah, it's still Issues so I can listen to it I just couldn't get into it. Great album overall though!"
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Fade Away by We Came As Romans. It comes off as a cheap attempt to get radio play. And while Dave's clean singing is fantastic in the other tracks he does it, in this one it's just not very good IMO."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Blue 42 by Haste the Day. Not a bad track by any means, but it doesn't live up to their other stuff. "
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","That's actually one of my favorites by them! For me it would probably be The Perfect Night off of When Everything Falls."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Blue 42 seems to be the fan favorite track from them, for some reason. "
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","It's the breakdowns man. They're crazy!"
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","If you're into breakdowns I can see why that would be a favorite. It's one of the most breakdown oriented tracks. I think something like If I Could See would be my favorite. "
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","I'm not a huge fan of either of ABR's Punk Goes Pop songs. They were fun to listen to at first, but that's about it"
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","I have to agree with you on that even though I'm not a big ABR fan. But man, I've been jamming to their cover of Wrecking Ball all week. Gets me pumped up everytime."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","I definitely like the Wrecking Ball cover a lot more than the other one, but I don't like either of them nearly as much as their actual stuff. I guess I'm just not a huge fan of pop covers in general"

The breakdown isn't even the best/heaviest on that album, let alone out of any they've written, and the whole song is just boring from after said breakdown. They should play A Cold Day In Hell in it's place."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Pangea by August Burns Red. I think that might be one of, if not their weakest song. Nothing about it stands out to me."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","I really like the intro riff, but maybe that's just me"
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","It's been so long since I've heard that song that I don't even remember how the intro goes haha."

this is moderately difficult at best, definitely not ""so technically loaded its unbelievable"""
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","I've seen it man. Obviously I'm not saying ABR got Yngwie Malmsteen for the song, but compare it to almost anything on the homepage. Far and away more technical than most -core. Not to mention the drums in the song. Pangea is Greiner at his best. It has a level of refinement and intricacy that you don't often find in this genre."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","then youve been listening to the wrong metalcore man"
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","You're misunderstanding me. I'm not saying that Pangea is the most technical thing I've ever heard, I'm just saying that compared to most of the songs posted on here (Crown the Empire, AA, etc.) it is definitely more thought out and technically sound. I misspoke when I said the technicality is ""unbelievable,"" but it's definitely more musically impressive than your average metalcore song."

"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Totally agree, but it's not even really metalcore, it's more like wannabe Manson buttrock"

"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","They had another chorus or two on the new album with that formula... They're okay enough, just radio rock..."

"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Miles Away is so shit, brings down the album a lot. Haven't heard Speechless though. "
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Honestly, Danger: Wildman by Devil Wear Prada. I enjoy that song right up until the clean bridge where they make Jeremy sound like a pop diva with an absurd amount of autotune (especially ""when FORGOOOOOOTEENN"".) I prefer Jeremy's more genuine voice now."

"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Is it? Damn I don't why they would mess with his voice so much, he's not a bad singer."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","I'm pretty sure Trevor only screams in Danger: Wildman.... I could be wrong though."
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","Nah that's Jeremy. Trevor does a back and forth with Mike during the last bit of the song. I think his opening line is ""the sun and the moon"""
"What song from a band you enjoy is your least favorite?","""Seen It All Before"" by BMTH. It seems like a carbon copy of the song before it, imo."

"Can we talk about Beartooth?","A couple of days ago i got to go to see them with Silverstein and Hands Like Houses on the Discovering The Waterfront 10 year anniversary tour,and it was fucking amazing. They managed to get people moshing to the sound check, it was intense. From all I've seen  about them, the music its self and Caleb being a total badass it seems like they are definitely in the scene to stay. The question here is do you think they are becoming the future of the scene, and where do they go from here? they seem to be pushing tour after a tour, and it seems like everyone already knows them only a year in. "

"Can we talk about Beartooth?","*Beartooth are the next big thing in the scene, do not sleep on them!*"
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","I really wish they hadn't made every song on S&amp;D have some poppy clean chorus. Other than the clean choruses, that album is bangin'. I will just never get why they decided to add these poppy choruses in the midst of furious hardcore. 

If they dropped that, they'd be my new favorite band, honestly."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","[WE GOT BIG FAAAAST WE GOT BIG FAAAAST IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE I WAS IN ATTACK ATTACK!](http://youtu.be/7pH6yQR04UY?t=1m36s)"
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","They'll be around for 3 more years at the very most."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","Lmao. Beartooth as the future. I can't even. "
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","I love them but there's really nothing unique or memorable about them; they're more of a listen when I'm feeling angry/pumped. I can't really see them becoming the future of metalcore as there's no redeeming quality to their music or their appeal. They're just five regular dudes jamming out, nothing more and nothing less."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","I think the most memorable thing would be that Caleb did literally everything, on the album he played all the instruments and did the editing, the rest of the band is just for touring."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","Nobody pays attention to that at all. It's hard to be original when you're doing everything. Also, the amount of emotion that Caleb uses is insane, and I don't know of another band that does that. Or not at least as well as Caleb does. "
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","This thread really hates Beartooth. To answer your question I thinks it's impossible to know where Beartooth will go since they've only released one full album and one of the more popular songs on that album was from the former ep. That being said I think it's stupid to think they can't be front leader in this genre I know a lot of friends who don't listen to anything even vaguely metal who like Beartooth cause Beaten in Lips and In Between having been getting some radio play, it definitely shows they're making a name out there and could even surpass Of Mice and Men as the big ones of the genre."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","dae this generic band is the future of the scene"
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","Is the scene really anything but generic at this point?"
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","This is plenty of good stuff out there, more so the older stuff or the underground stuff and any of the mathcore or blackened stuff is great. At least in my opinion."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","Oh I'm not denying that metalcore is good at all. I love the genre! I mean the mainstream metalcore scene right now is really generic. I love a lot of the types of stuff you listed there. Sorry for any confusion!"
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","Oh I thought you were saying something else. Totally cool man, no worries my fault. I thought you were just algoods with the genre being generic."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","n-no you don't understand because I like this band they must be the future of the scene"
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","You raise a solid point. In fact I completely agree. It's nice to see hardcore punk bands like Beartooth reach mainstream success when they try new things like unique song structure!"

"Can we talk about Beartooth?","You and I both know that, deep down inside, the lyrics from Beartooth's song *Sick and Disgusting* speak to you on a level that no elitistcore song could possibly dream of."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","I actually identify more with Sleeping With Sirens, but The Bearteeth are definitely up there too"
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","They'll do what Of Mice and Men did."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","suck?"
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","They always did that"
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","Yep but also playing radio friendly music"
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","Beartooth has been around since 2012 or so, it hasn't been only a year."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","Well Sick came out in 2013 and Disgusting came out in early 2014, and they havent been playing anything from the ep lately."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","Beartooth has been a thing since Caleb was in Attack Attack! and they've released stuff before 2013."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","I know he did all the electronic stuff for AA, even in the first album the Interlude was all him, unless he considers that Beartooth i have no idea what else was released before the first EP.

"
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","they released a few satirical songs but deleted them in like 2012, it was caleb's side-project while in AA! lol."

"Can we talk about Beartooth?","i can't deal with the cleans"
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","Beartooth seems to have gotten popular really fast, probably due to Caleb being in Attack Attack before.  I think that due to their ever increasing popularity, they very well might be one of the new big names in the scene. However, the Disgusting album was quite generic and I would appreciate them changing it up on the next album. 

Also, I think they may tour a little too much as the live videos I've seen lately have shown Caleb being pretty burnt out."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","Seeing them live there was a surprising amount of time where he wasnt singing, the crowd knew every word so they picked it all up, also at one point all of Vanna came out on stage and took over for the whole band then left after one song, super strange but awesome."
"Can we talk about Beartooth?","I think they're rad. I don't listen to them a whole lot, but they're a good band, and different enough to be noticeable. And from what I hear they put on a great show, so I can see them having staying power."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways",""
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Glad you guys are digging this track.  I've wanted to work with Landon for a long time, so I was stoked as hell to mix and master this for the band."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Soo I like the song. I like the chorus, I like the breakdowns. Landon sounds swell and all. But the guitars straight up sound like pooooop. They have no kick. When that last breakdown kicks in, it just doesn't pack a punch like it should. "
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","There's a fart at 2:52

Landon, you bastard..."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","I don't think I'm gonna be able to listen to the song without noticing that every single time"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Haha i was wondering if anyone else heard it too"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","seriously though, why?"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","I think a lot of producers like to do stuff like this just for fun. I know that Joey Sturgis likes to put random farts in songs too."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","This is actually a thing? "
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Exceeded every expectation I had, some real next level shit"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Damn this is good. I wonder which label they are gonna end up on. "
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","That chorus!!!! So good :D"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Interesting, not completely sure what to think of this yet, didn't have too high expectations, since I wasn't too into their older stuff. I really liked the lyrics to this one though

Edit: Also just really liked the general atmosphere of it"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","I like this more than almost anything on their last album. I love the chord progression and like you said, the atmosphere is sweet."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Completely agree with you, I also really like how much emotion is in the vocals"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Yes, Landon is an amazing vocalist."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","This song is really showing me that, I guess I never really gave him much of a chance before, because the last album sort of kept me from getting into them"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Loved the atmosphere on this song. It's a different direction that what we are usually accustomed to with TPIY but it's a really solid track. Landon writes in many different styles but he always seems to bring it home. "
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","I liked this, nothing really special about it, but it pleased my ear holes"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","I didn't dislike their older material, but it didn't exactly hook me (This was also before I really got into heavier metalcore).

I like this a lot more. Great chorus"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","This was so much better than I anticipated. I love when that happens."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","YES YES YES. I have always been a fan of Plot, but THIS is everything I look for in a song. Great work, I cannot for the new album."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","I feel like it's easy to tell that this song started with the vocals/lyrics and the music got thrown on top of it. The lyrics and melodies are all really good and Landon's vocals are the best they've ever been but the music is definitely just supporting Landon. I hope the rest of the new stuff is more well-rounded 
"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Landon's vocals are easily the best thing about this. I'm constantly impressed with how versatile he is. The music itself wasn't very creative though, and the breakdown felt a bit forced. Either way, I'm super stoked for the rest of the album and curious to see how different it is from their older stuff. Also, I love the tones and production way more than CYWYCB."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","I feel like it's always been that way with the plot in you. I don't think that's a bad thing either"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Is anyone else heading solo project in his vocals? Like, he spent a long time improving his singing for his solo stuff and now he's incorporating that style into Plot."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Wow I'm loving this track"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Dang, really digging this. Definitely a progression from their last album."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","I believe they are on artery now.  Idk how I feel about this song.  I loved the last breakdown but the whole song was just a little boring and less emotion."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","on the contrary, i felt like it had a ton of emotion, just not portrayed in the way we're used to from TPIY. i love the song, personally, got chills at a number of points through the song. "
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","I agree with you, it definitely had a lot of emotion. In fact, I feel that, in a way, it had more emotion than most of their other stuff. It wasn't so anger focused, it still had a lot of anger in it, but their were a lot of other emotions mixed in. "
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","No surprises on artery really.

They seem to scoop up everything dropped by Sumerian/Fearless/Rise
(not thats that a bad plan, but not signing anything new really...)"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","The Plot In You was on Rise before right?"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Yep"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","That name tho"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Yeah I have to agree with you. I'm getting the whole nu metal feel from this. ~~A little disappointing.~~

Gave it another listen. It might not be as heavy as their previous releases, but it's much better than any other band going for this sound ^Such^as^Of^Mice^&amp;^Men.

And they at least still threw in the breakdown at the end so they aren't completely gong away from their sound."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","[deleted]"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","i loved the track but i don't think they're going soft. definetly gonna have some heavy track too. they've been playing a song live i think its called crows, but it pretty classic tpiy"
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","This is AMAZING. Landons vocals sound so clean, but the breakdown about 2 minutes in feels almost nostalgic. Amazing work."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","Really like this new song."
"The Plot In You - My Old Ways","My rating is a solid ehh/10. I seriously can't decide if I like it. I like Landon's vocals (although I always like his vocals) but the breakdown felt forced and the lyrics I felt were kinda weaker and whinier then their other stuff."

"Attila - ""Rage"" (RAGE DAYZ BROS)","I kind of agree, their first album was called ""Soundtrack to a party"""
"Attila - ""Rage"" (RAGE DAYZ BROS)","That's not their first album, it's just the first one on Spotify and iTunes. [Falacy](http://youtu.be/mgcCImkm8zg) is their first. "
"Attila - ""Rage"" (RAGE DAYZ BROS)","I stand corrected. thanks for the info."
"Attila - ""Rage"" (RAGE DAYZ BROS)","Lyrically the same, yes. But the sound changed, I can't throw on soundtrack to a party and jam with friends like I can the newer stuff. ""Ten years later and were still a fuckin band, if you've ever been a hater I'm your number 1 fan"" is the best example. I stop whatever I'm doing at the time just to jam and recite that lyric with my friends religiously. The older music just doesn't have that. I love both sounds though. So that's rad."
"Attila - ""Rage"" (RAGE DAYZ BROS)","I'm having trouble understanding what you mean"
"Attila - ""Rage"" (RAGE DAYZ BROS)","I guess this doesn't translate well through text. I just don't get the catchy vibes from the old stuff I guess? Oh well."

"Attila - ""Rage"" (RAGE DAYZ BROS)","I'm pretty sure that episode of Made came out before the band was even formed."
"Attila - ""Rage"" (RAGE DAYZ BROS)","Definitely not, since they have footage of Fronz playing shows during the intro part of the Made episode "
"Attila - ""Rage"" (RAGE DAYZ BROS)","Gotta love dat flip phone action shot."
"Attila - ""Rage"" (RAGE DAYZ BROS)","last good attila album imo, glad to have caught them touring it....they can't even cross the border anymore its been like 4-5 years"
"Attila - ""Rage"" (RAGE DAYZ BROS)","Man I miss the good old Attila. Guitars were always spot on and the versatility of Fronz was paramount to the controversy he creates. 
"
"Attila - ""Rage"" (RAGE DAYZ BROS)","Ah yes, when I still respected them."

"Fit For A King - Ancient Waters (2013 Reissue)","It's most likely whichever one we listened to first we will like better. I think the reissue mix is probably better as the guitar is more present at all times."

I need your recommendation for the songs. 

|But why don't you look at similar bands and look at their songs|

I did, but it's hard to find something when i'm not exactly know what i am listening too.

Examples:

[The amity affiction: FML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQWwH04zdjQ) chorus part doesn't motivate me, it's kind of soft. 

[Forevermore - The Wager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCyDpo522aw) This song has the opposite effect. I don't know if it even has a chorus part and if it has it's too aggressive for me.

Even if In hearts wake- healer is my main song. I don't listen to their other songs, well only In hearts wake- afterglow a little, but by far Healer is my top1.


Could you, good people, point me at least in the direction i should search for my lifting music? or throw away some possible songs for me?"

"Need help with lifting music","Thanks a lot copyrytedlizzerd - added some song to my playlist. All thanks to you"
"Need help with lifting music","Glad to have helped."
"Need help with lifting music","I generally stay more into groove metal (pseudo-metalcore is what I prefer to call it) and hardcore/melodic hardcore when I work out. Bands like Sepultura, Lamb of God, Soulfly, and The Ghost Inside are great for lifting."

  the ghost inside-mercy  
"
"Need help with lifting music","I had no idea what style i liked. I would just randomly search every style until after an hour i find a one song. For example healer i found on ""breakdown top's"" on youtube. But I looked other breakdown and nothing fitted me. So i decided apart randomly searching, I would ask for your help so you would point me at least in a direction i should search.

I guess the style I should search up: is called melodic hardcore. Thanks.

I enjoy the hard singing part- it get's me hyped for the lift, but ,i guess, I like cleaner vocal on chorus part. In healer, pre chorus part and chorus part is clean- at least for me. The problem is it's kind of hard for me to find a good song with clean,but hard/heavy vocal+melodic music (healer fits perfectly). On Asthma attack- After phrase ""No Mercy"" I know I have to lift, even if there is no vocal that instrumental part is very motivating for me.

The ghost inside- mercy didn't fitted me. But from their album song: Move on, looked great for me, added it to the playlist for example."
"Need help with lifting music","yeah the pre chorus in healer is sick. Id recommend just surfing looking around this subreddit and the melodic hardcore one to find stuff you like. Good luck!

"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","they were pretty good, after rage they kinda sucked"
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","Kinda is an understatement imo. Well Outlawed wasn't too bad, but it led to ATL and GP.. "
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","I don't understand what people have against Outlawed. I understand the hate against About That Life and Guilty Pleasure, even though I enjoy them myself. But Outlawed was my introduction to Attila and is IMO a great album."
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","it was ok"
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","Goodbye Graceful by FiR. The rest of their music does nothing for me, but that is one catchy song."
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","I'm not exactly a fan of FiR, but theyre first album definitely has songs I enjoy.

I'd say about half of the songs on that album are pretty good. At the very least it shows that they have the talent to be really good, they just decide not to be. Hopefully their new album changes that
"
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","I love FiR's first album, except for like two tracks. The only track I don't really like is Sink or Swim. "
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","That's one of the tracks I really liked haha. I'm not as much of a fan of songs like I'm Not A Vampire but I definitely like their heavier stuff.

"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","I'm definitely the opposite haha. I'm Not a Vampire, Tragic Magic, and Pick Up the Phone are my favorite tracks. They can write some really catchy stuff. "
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","That they can"
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","This War is Ours by Escape The Fate. The rest of their songs sound god awful to me but this song is pretty good and also quite fun to play on drums"
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","Dat guitar solo"
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","A Voice From Below by Emmure. That first riff is awesome, but I can't stand any of their other songs. 

Also - Breathless by Asking Alexandria. Chorus is catchy af. "

"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","The Wretched by Attack Attack! It sounds basically like a Beartooth song anyway. Their two first albums are dreadful IMO and the last was pretty dull, except for this one song."
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","Would You Still Be There by OMAM. I hate everything those guys touch, but I've always loved Aaron's vocals since he was in Jamie's Elsewhere, and he's the main focus of the song...couple that with the chorus which is catchy as balls...I just enjoy it. "

"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","Them is fightin words"
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","There are a couple of Blood on the Dancefloor songs I like. Specifically [Money and Hoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onpB2JnVUcY) and [You're a Dancer Not a Lover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8fIy7vBuzA). 

And [Destruction of a Statue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKbSwWbf6I4) by Suicide Silence. Especially the riff at 1:30. It's like Carnifex's track [Hope Dies With the Decadent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVOsc0hEES0), just not quite as good. "
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","Haha you just know from that riff from Destruction of a Statue that the guitarists had to have been fans of Unholy Confessions by A7X. It's the like deathcore version of that riff."
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","I don't know the riff of Unholy Confessions of the top of my head, but I think the SS one is knocking off At the Gates' album [Slaughter of the Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzLhT39DSE0). "
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","That's pretty damn close, but I'm positive that you could layer [A7X's drums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-QaFWURsMU) over SS's riff and it would be perfect."
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","I hear it. 

I think SS just straight up stole the riff. It sounds EXACTLY the same. 

I think both are going for the Slaughter of the Soul sound though. "
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","Yeah I'm pretty sure if you go back far enough you trace nearly all riff based metalcore and deathcore to At The Gates. That's some good stuff there. "
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","Favorite album hands down. "
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","[deleted]"
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","It's also very similar to [Reinvention](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjNwYg5UVEY) by As I Lay Dying"
"What song do you really enjoy by a band that you can't stand?","I would say very similar is a stretch. Those are nearly identical. If I were more cynical I would complain about the lack of creativity, but all of those riffs are so cool. "

"What is your opinion of Philip Labonte?","I know they supposedly went to shit after The Fall of Ideals, so it might have been from a later album. 

"
"What is your opinion of Philip Labonte?","yeah I thought that they kind've did, you're right"
"What is your opinion of Philip Labonte?","Used to be a very powerful vocalist. Saw them about 2 years ago and he was out of breath half the time. Plus, the rock stuff he's doing is really holding back the rest of the band."
"What is your opinion of Philip Labonte?","I saw them twice, once during the Fall of Ideals time and one during Overcome, they were amazing. Now with all the rock and autotuned vocals I can't bring myself to listen to them. The new album has 1 decent song, possibly 2, the rest is soft radio rock.

But yeah he comes off as a bit of a douche on social media, but I don't care about that I just listen to the music. I also still listen to AILD and gave the new FIR a listen."
"What is your opinion of Philip Labonte?","For clarification, Phil is the vocalist of All That Remains and also from what I can tell is known for making some pretty outspoken political statements.  You can look into it more if you want.  I was too lazy to read through the article that came out about him recently.

"What is your opinion of Philip Labonte?","Great vocalist.  Don't agree with some of his politically based stances, but that doesn't affect my respect for him as a vocalist. "
"What is your opinion of Philip Labonte?","It's well established that I think he's a complete and utter asshole and therefore I refuse to support his music.

Which I'm sure will start the same debate I've been having for the past 2 weeks all over again. (ie the ""just because he's a bad person doesn't mean you can't like his music!"" thing)"
"What is your opinion of Philip Labonte?","Honestly, I don't know what anyones talking about in this thread since I don't pay attention to them much outside of their music.  But I do think it's weird some people say they won't listen to a band because one of the members is a jerk or something, when I see people posting on As I Lay Dying songs with stuff like ''i dont care if he wanted to murder his wife, the music is still awesome''"
"What is your opinion of Philip Labonte?","Phil basically said that gays aren't allowed to feel persecuted because they're not going through what black people went through in the 1950s.

And just in my personal opinion, I cannot support musicians that say stuff like that. If I buy their music, their t-shirt, or go to one of their shows, I'm funding them. I'm giving them a bigger platform. People like that don't deserve a platform. Kids look up to people like Phil Labonte and people agree with what he said solely because he's Phil Labonte. That's wrong."
"What is your opinion of Philip Labonte?","Wow, I didn't think he would've said something that foolish, I get why people wouldn't want to support their stuff, kinda why I don't pay attention to bands outside of their music and read interviews etc, don't want the music ruined for me"
"What is your opinion of Philip Labonte?","I'm on mobile, otherwise I'd post a super supportive clapping meme for you. This, 1000%. ""Six"" used to be one of my favorites, but his absolute dickishness as a human being ruined it all for me."

"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","After some soul-searching, I've come to the realization that I might like Metalcore. However, perusing this subreddit has shown me that in order to call yourself a ""true Metalcore fan"" and not get shat over by other fans, you must not like certain bands/styles in the genre. A common thing I see on this sub is disdain for ""whiny"" or high vocals, for instance. 

The thing is, I don't know why. I've taken a listen at some bands which embody this hated style, and I truly truly cannot see *why* they're hated. Maybe I have shit taste: but my musical taste is pretty well-developed, I like to think. I haven't listened to radio/pop shit in damn near a decade and listen to a pretty wide variety of genres. 

I just don't get it when I hear a song, like it, and then find out that everyone hates it (and its band) for some completely un-discernible reason. I don't mind high-pitched male singers, for instance, but apparently liking a band with them is a mortal sin here. 

"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Bruh if you don't listen to parkway drive you don't even know  trve metalcore 

Nah I'm kidding like what you like, when I first came to this sub and the genre I thought metalcore was only heavy as bands with just screaming and that everyone would be like oh La Dispute is for pussies if I mentioned them (I know they are phc) but after a but of time I realised no one is like the first line of my comment, people are relatively nice here and will accept your music taste, and its a 100% subjective on what's good or not, so you be the judge."
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Dude, don't base your musical tastes off what other people think, especially those around here. I'm not sure why you are concerned about having a ""well-developed musical taste"", whatever that is. I mean, we listen to music where the vocalists growl like wild animals, get real. Just listen to what you like to listen to, ignore the haters."
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","You like what you like, nothing wrong with that, by the way, on the subject on high-pitched male singers, definitely check out Erra if you're not familiar with them"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Oooh man, I'm loving Erra already. Thanks for the suggestion."
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","No problem"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Seriously though, it was music like this that got me into Metalcore in the first place.

I really like the interplay between clean vocals and harsh ones. Sorry to beg for recs, but do you have any suggestions for bands like that?"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Well, I'd suggest a lot of the bands they're currently on tour with, Miss May I, Northlane, and Fit For a King. August Burns Red doesn't have any cleans, but they're still a great band, and they have some really nice melodic riffs. Also definitely check out Architects, especially their album Daybreaker if you like great cleans"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Thanks, I'll look them up."
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Sounds good, hope you like them!"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Silent Planet is really similar to Erra too"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Thank you! Never heard of them before, I'm halfway through Augment and I think I'm in love."
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Great!"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","I don't like breakdowns, I think you'll be just fine liking whiny vocals. "
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","&gt; I don't like breakdowns

Blasphemy."
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","....okay... fine... there are some breakdowns I like. "
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","I was just kidding but almost every one that likes metalcore will like at least one breakdown"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","I can definitely think of a few I like. "
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Do you dig the ""we'rewolf"" one by ETID"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","I just relistened to it and didn't hear a breakdown. So, I guess so? I know I loved every second of the song. "
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Well I'm not sure if you can call it a breakdown but I was meaning when that awesome riff happens at the end but at the same time it makes me want to mosh haha its such an epic fun song"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","It is a great song. 

But if you want an example of a breakdown I do like, listen to In Coalesce With Filth and Faith by Carnifex, that's my favorite one. "
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Not the biggest deathcore fan or of those types of breakdown but its better than the breakdowns at every chorus that are slow as fuck "
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Hm. With that breakdown, it's the kick drums hitting behind the chugs that makes me like it. Angels Shall Shall Sin, Demons Shall Pray by Chelsea Grin is another one like that.  For a metalcore breakdown try Suffocating Sight by Trivium, Defender by As I Lay Dying, or  Indictment by All That Remains. 

Also Beaten in Lips by Beartooth. "
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","I'm not the biggest metalcore fan either, mathcore and hardcore is where I'm at. Though thanks for them, will get around to jaming to all those breakdowns"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","I usually go with the normal life advice for this kinda stuff. People like what they like, and some people don't. I like AA, alot of people don't. Should that cause me to dislike them? Not at all, you like who you like."
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Whiny high vocals can get a bit much to be honest. My experience is listen to what you want and if you like it continue to listen to it. However be careful what you mention around here, people get mad when you say things like Sworn In, or Black Veil Brides."
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","I love Sworn in. Wearing a Sworn In hoodie right now haha"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","If you like a band it really shouldn't matter what other people think about it. Musical taste is thankfully subjective. 

Also, from my experiences there are bands with high pitched, ""whiny"" vocals that are pretty well liked here. Bands like blessthefall and I See Stars usually get a lot of upvotes. Which bands are you talking about in particular?"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","This thread was inspired from a friend recently showing me a song by A Skylit Drive (specifically, *Rise*) which I thought sounded good. Nothing I hadn't heard before, but I liked it. But then another guy told me ""Oh that band is complete shit dude, don't listen to them"".
"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","ASD are pretty good, especially their old stuff. They are generally considered post-hardcore though."
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","&gt;ASD are pretty good

Oh...

I just assumed that this sub would hate them. Yay, I can like them now! I've heard them referred to as ""Melodic Metalcore"" as well as Post-Hardcore, though. These subgenres are confusing.

And yeah, Post-Hardcore is the other genre I'm thinking of getting into, mainly because for the longest time I've been listening to this Japanese band called Foreground Eclipse which is PHC. Eventually, I was just ""I should listen to more bands like this"" so I started searching and then started getting interested in Metalcore."

"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","&gt;Liking shitty things is a sign of bad taste, and who the fuck wants to have bad taste?

Bad taste doesn't exist. Music is 100% subjective. "
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Be yourself. Don't base your concept of ""good taste"" on other people. Like 75% of the population listen to ""poppy radio shit"", why don't you base your good taste off them?"
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","True... but if you can't help but like shit music, what can you do? You could force yourself to listen to what everyone deems ""good music"" and see if it will grow on you. 
Personally, I usually double back every 2 years or so and listen to bands(not just metalcore) I didn't like at first or didn't understand the appeal. My music tastes evolve enough for me to find the enjoyment in the music that I previously didn't get understand.
And if you seriously want to have better music tastes... that's your own journey to go through and discover."
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","&gt;You could force yourself to listen to what everyone deems ""good music"" and see if it will grow on you.

Uh...I'm not forcing myself. I often end up liking both what is considered ""bad"" music and ""good"" music, that's the thing. Honestly, most of the time, I can find *something* good in almost any song, because I just listen to songs, instead of endlessly yelling about what is good and what isn't. 

I have pretty good music tastes already. It's just that unlike most, I only care about whether the song sounds good. I could care less who made it or what genre it's in or whatever. I have my genre preferences but I wont write off a song just because it's in a particular genre (unless it's poppy radio shit, that stuff just sucks in general)."
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","... then why are we even having this conversation? It seemed to me that you were worried that people would judge you because you like a certain type of metalcore."
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","Because as much as I hate to admit it, people will judge you depending on your tastes in music?

I mean, I don't really care what people think, but it's still very annoying when someone endlessly shits all over stuff you like."
"I think I like Metalcore, but I'm not totally sure.","&gt;Because as much as I hate to admit it, people will judge you depending on your tastes in music?

Children, maybe. 

No grown ass adult gives a fuck about your taste enough to give you shit.

People don't like your taste? Fuck 'em. They're petty and worthless. 

&gt;I mean, I don't really care what people think, but it's still very annoying when someone endlessly shits all over stuff you like.

"BMTH - Shadow Moses | Live Intro Edit (couldn't find studio track of live version anywhere, so I edited it in Audacity)","To a quality stickler like myself, it seems like you have the intro in really good quality (256-320), but then the Shadow Moses track sounds like you ripped it off the music video from youtube (128-192 quality). 

Or, maybe its just the way YouTube recompressed the mp3 after exporting from audacity. 

I really like how you did this though, very well done. I've done a few of these myself, like adding the Big Wiggly Style intro to Danger: Wildman by TDWP as they play it live, and fusing the ""triology"" of Periphery songs together from their second album. I love stuff like that. "

Breakdown of Sanity -  Because they are fucking amazing. Their album Perception was fantastic and I really hope they get a States tour. They re-released a new song ""My heart in your hands"" on Dec 31st, self produced and everything. They are so fucking good. 

Texas In July- Personally BloodWork (their most recent album 2014) was my album of the year and quite possibly my all time favorite album. They draw alot of similarities towards August Burns Red (I don't see how they do but everyone's opinion is different). BloodWork features their new single JT Cavey, all their older albums are their old front man, while good, I think JT fits the band better. 

A Breach of Silence -  Their newest album The Darkest Road was like 13 tracks of awesomeness. One of the few bands that I like with clean vocals. 

Feed Her To The Sharks -  Savage Seas is a fucking amazing album, new album releases in 3 days and it's already being streamed. It's awesome. 

WhiteChapel -  On the boarder of deathcore but their most recent album was fucking amazing. Specifically the song The Saw Is The Law. I believe Phil Bozeman(vocalist and one of the best in the business)  said they recorded that track in garage band just to prove it could be done. 

Old MMI -  Apologies are for the weak and Monument are 2 albums of straight fucking headbanging. Their newest albums are meh, but not terrible (can't stand Rise of the lion). 

This Or The Apocalypse -  one of the few bands whose guitarists play riffs throughout the entire song, including breakdowns. The song Americans is fucking awesome.

"So now that Of Mice &amp; Men has left the metalcore genre....","it has a lot of post-rock and post-hardcore elements, but it doesn't really ride of the line between metalcore and post-hardcore imo. it's just metalcore with a lot of influence and elements from different genres."
"So now that Of Mice &amp; Men has left the metalcore genre....","I could see what you mean by that. Pretty good album nonetheless."
"So now that Of Mice &amp; Men has left the metalcore genre....","I don't see August Burns Red, or Parkway Drive changing thier sound any time soon, and they are the best in the metalcore scene. "

That said, i think i've only seen them once since the release of Dead Throne. I'm not really a fan of where they've taken their sound since."
"The Devil Wears Prada - Dogs Can, Grow beards All Over","I don't understand the appeal of old TDWP. Like, can anyone specifically tell me what they like about the song, particularly the parts between 0:59 - 1:34? I can't imagine anyone who is into metalcore liking that."
"The Devil Wears Prada - Dogs Can, Grow beards All Over","it's unique, and you can't really generalize people that way, 2 people can both like metalcore but not like the same bands because they like different styles of metalcore."
"The Devil Wears Prada - Dogs Can, Grow beards All Over","I love metalcore but old tdwp is best tdwp for me. I really like the part you listed cause the deep screams are unique and it has a cool best you don't ordinarily hear.

"The Devil Wears Prada - Dogs Can, Grow beards All Over","This was o w of the first metalcore songs that I had ever listened to and that part in the song that you specifically mention is what got me hooked. That part is pretty damn ruthless. Those lows, man, those looooows."

When we got there, they were getting ready to come on stage and one of my friends points him out and was like ""damn, that stage hand is massive"". 

He didn't believe me when I said that was their new vocalist until he came on stage. He's built like a damn NFL line backer, its ridiculous. Especially matched with Jesse Cash and the rest of the band whose all pretty small lol. "
"ERRA - Warrior (Official Music Video)","The dude is a tank! I saw them last night in Portland. They're by far my favorite band."

"ERRA - Warrior (Official Music Video)","Most likely when he paused it and posted it to here."
"ERRA - Warrior (Official Music Video)","That's exactly it. Sorry about that! Wasn't intentional. "
"ERRA - Warrior (Official Music Video)","Maybe it's just me but I feel like the new erra is missing something. it might have to do with Garrison and Alan's departure, but I just can't get into the new stuff the same way I did with Impulse and Augment. Not to take away from this though they still make great music."
"ERRA - Warrior (Official Music Video)","Agreed. Moments of Clarity does feel like it's missing something (although I do enjoy it), but I think that's because it was kinda rushed. I'm hoping their next release will be more on par with Impulse and Augment."
"ERRA - Warrior (Official Music Video)","I believe Alan had a major influence to their djenty guitar chords and riffs. I kinda miss the old sound in their new stuff. 

Give this [guitar promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lz0ZiJjykQ) a listen.. it's really great

Jesse then started using more guitar solos (Hybrid Earth) and added more cleans to the song. Maybe that's why Alan left since Jesse was standing out more than him. I still enjoy their new stuff but not to the extent of Andromeda or Impulse. "
"ERRA - Warrior (Official Music Video)","Yea man after watching the video I can see the difference. It's too bad, they really sounded great together, and Andromeda was baller."
"ERRA - Warrior (Official Music Video)","Really liking this Erra as of late, solid music and the main singer is a fucking tank!

edit: removed something I know the answer to."
"ERRA - Warrior (Official Music Video)","They were good live except for the clean singer. I don't know whether it was the equipment or what but whenever he sang it was all scratchy because he was too high."
"ERRA - Warrior (Official Music Video)","Definitely sounds like it might've been the equipment, he sounded great at the show I was at"
"ERRA - Warrior (Official Music Video)","He sounded fantastic in Portland. "
"ERRA - Warrior (Official Music Video)","Easily one of my favorite bands right now! Does anybody know what they tune each guitar to? I noticed Jesse is playing a 6-string, but Sean is playing a 7-string. "

Probably one of my new favourite bands and I can't stop listening to Augment/Moments of Clarity as of late. This song can be neatly filed into the ""kicking fucking ass"" section of quality heavy metal music. 

What I want to know is how Ian manages to maintain that physique while touring (and presumably eating less because of budget restrictions). I have a ton of respect for anyone who takes care of their body like that. I really wish I could have seen these guys on the FF tour, but it didn't come to Vancouver and work for grad school prevented me from going to the Seattle gig. Sad days.

"A Day to remember recording new music","You mean like their first releases that were acoustic?"
"A Day to remember recording new music","Their first album has acoustic stuff."
"A Day to remember recording new music","True, However you had me at hello is  great song and it was only 1 from an album. The last 2 albums have had 5 heavy songs between them. "
"A Day to remember recording new music","I hope for more Old Record type music"
"A Day to remember recording new music","As someone who hardly has time to find out about this stuff. Thank you for posting On, this made my day. Can't wait! "
"A Day to remember recording new music","That was a quick turnaround between albums! "
"A Day to remember recording new music","Somewhat worryingly quick."
"A Day to remember recording new music","They had CC written for a while before they could release it. They also have said numerous times that they had upwards of 30 songs written while putting it together. So I'm not too worried. Also it said they're going to start recording, so they probably just have a time booked. It won't be till the end of this year or the beginning of next year that we should expect a whole album from them."
"A Day to remember recording new music","ADTR have said a few times before that they write on the road so when working on a new album they have songs ready and can head straight into the studio. It could be Summer (new material for festivals) or just after that we here it"

"A Day to remember recording new music","u wot m8?"
"A Day to remember recording new music","Some of us like CC and WSMFY more"
"A Day to remember recording new music","I'm really confused as to why people want a strictly metalcore FTWHH kind of album. They're not just metalcore, and their other stuff is really good and it's what they like to do. Also, why would you ever want a band to make a copy of a previous album?"
"A Day to remember recording new music","Seriously, going back to playing generic AtTheGatescore would be awful, it's such a dated and outplayed sound now. Common Courtesy was a huge success and a few steps up from WSMFY. I'm excited to see what they have in store, as always."
"A Day to remember recording new music","I loved Common Courtesy. Hope they keep that sound up!"
"A Day to remember recording new music","I really love ADTR but I hope they right some more varied breakdowns this time. Almost all of them, across all albums, sound pretty much the same. Gets a bit boring after a while."
"A Day to remember recording new music","I want to be, but I can't get excited for this... "
"A Day to remember recording new music","Make it all heavy. PLEASE. No more Pop-Punk."
"A Day to remember recording new music","How have people not figured out that ADTR are a fusion band? They play a little heavy, they play a little soft. "
"A Day to remember recording new music","Seriously! ADTR aren't as popular as they are because of their heavy stuff, it's because of their catchy poppy tunes. They aren't going to completely disregard that fan base who likes their softer music just like how they won't abandon their heavier roots for their long time fans. ADTR are one of the only bands in the metalcore genre that I can tolerate the clean and poppy vocals. No, they didn't reinvent the wheel or anything but they have a formula and they can perfectly execute it. "
"A Day to remember recording new music","I'm really glad and a little surprised that they haven't stopped doing heavier tracks."
"A Day to remember recording new music","Especially after WSMFY the future of a heavy ADTR seemed bleak. I was very pleased with the sound of CC. Life Lessons Learned The Hard Way is definitely one of their heaviest songs to date."
"A Day to remember recording new music","Really? I thought WSMFY was their heaviest album. Second Sucks, You be tails and stick ands bricks are proper metalcore songs."
"A Day to remember recording new music","Yeah, but besides those 3 songs, the rest of the album was entirely pop-punk. Compared to Homesick, there was way less metalcore songs or parts. And FTWHH had metalcore elements in almost every song."
"A Day to remember recording new music","Wat? Homesick has  a breakdown in almost every song. WSMFY only has 2 heavy songs... "
"A Day to remember recording new music","Pop-mosh and proud"
"A Day to remember recording new music","noo, they were never pop punk until WSMFY, and it's generic as shit too. Sounds like any other pop punk band."
"A Day to remember recording new music","Both Monument and Here's to the Past off FTWHH are borderline pop punk, not to mention The Price We Pay is a very soft song off the same album. Moreover, Homesick had Downfall of Us All, NJ Legion Iced Tea, Homesick, and Another Song About the Weekend.

There's no denying that ADTR has had punk and pop punk influences from their earlier days. WSYFM wasn't there first album with pop punk, nor will it be their last."
"A Day to remember recording new music","Man... I like a DISRESPECT YOUR SURROUNDINGS song as much as the next guy, but the songs you mention are some of my favorites from ADTR. I like the band for what they are. There are thousands of metalcore and deathcore bands out there that make great heavy music, no need for ADTR to be the same all the time."
"A Day to remember recording new music","Have you listened to Old Record at all?! Some quality pop punk on that album."
"A Day to remember recording new music","Aren't they a pop punk band?"
"A Day to remember recording new music","I hope it doesnt sound like Common Courtesy, not many good songs on that album. Which is wierd coming from ADTR a band that has so many good songs that it's hard to choose a favorite."

"Looking for some new bands to get into, but I can't find any that I really like.","&gt;A Shrine to Madness is my favorite song on that album

Either Blood in the Ink or A Grave Robber's Work was mine. The JFAC vibe just keeps most of the album from being ""amazing"" to me. But that's just me.

"Frozen Flame question","I looked up all the setlists online and made a megaplaylist haha but thank you!"
"Frozen Flame question","I did the same lol"
"Frozen Flame question","Hmm... I didn't have Alpha Seed on my setlist I made about a month ago, and Our Kings was switched with Tides.  I guess MMI switched things up a little bit mid tour.

Thankfully, I still have a couple weeks until the concert since I haven't really listened to either of them prior to getting my ticket."
"Frozen Flame question","damn when I saw them live this was the set list. you missed out"
"Frozen Flame question","Oh, no, I just found the setlists online early in the tour (late January) and put them into one massive list on Spotify to prepare for the one I'm going to in March.

I could've worded that better, but I'm glad that I saw this so I can listen to the updated list.  I got the ticket for ABR, and have found myself listening to Erra and Northlane more than ABR recently."
"Frozen Flame question","have fun, the lineup is amazing"

"Demon Hunter - One Thousand Apologies","I remember that during my senior year of high school (2012) during our football season, we would play music in the locker room before games and what not. For years it was all rap music or radio rock like Three Days Grace or something. One day a guy on our team blasts this song, and is like ""This is so heavy! It gets me amped!"" And I just shook my head and laughed. The guy asked why I laughed and I got out my ipod and was like ""No, this is the heaviest song by this band,"" and proceeded to play ""Undying"". He never played another Demon Hunter song in the locker room haha"

"What are you guys's guilty pleasure song/albums?","I love all the tracks on that album. When I first started to listen to heavier music they were my gateway. I think I listened to that album 5 times in one day. I even enjoy HxC 2-Step"
"What are you guys's guilty pleasure song/albums?","HxC 2-Step is the only ""proper"" (proper as in fits the definition) crunkcore I've ever heard. And it's actually pretty neat. "
"What are you guys's guilty pleasure song/albums?","I've actually never listened to them, but they seemed to make a huge impact when they broke up. Any good places to start? "
"What are you guys's guilty pleasure song/albums?","I would say just jump right in to You Can't Spell Slaughter Without Laughter. Its their first and best record

Things that Rhyme with Orange if you like more poppy integrated stuff and actually Reese Pieces I Don't Know Who John Cleese Is is a pretty structurally sound song as well

"
"What are you guys's guilty pleasure song/albums?","To add to that, 'Life Hertz' is actually a pretty nice song, and 'It comes naturally' is catchy as fuck, both of which are on their second album. "

"What are you guys's guilty pleasure song/albums?","**Woe, Is Me - Genesi[s]**

I liked it for the chugfest that it was. Not anything special, but gets me pumped as shit, what with the breakdowns every 2 seconds and whatnot. 

**Abandon All Ships - Geeving**

The fallen heroes of crabcore's only listenable album IMO."
"What are you guys's guilty pleasure song/albums?","I enjoyed infamous, but then again theres something about them and other mediocre electronicore bands that hold a special place in my heart. shame they broke up, though. "
"What are you guys's guilty pleasure song/albums?","Seconded on Woe, Is Me.  Genesi[s] is such a hype album.  So much energy, regardless of how good or bad most of the songs actually are."
"What are you guys's guilty pleasure song/albums?","Yeah, it's definitely a good album to get the blood flowing. [This one might be my favorite on the album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgcDYOHBojQ) (and also has a killer BLEGH). "
"What are you guys's guilty pleasure song/albums?","I think [this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEj5iq9Ko98#t=146) is my favorite breakdown on the album, but I Came, I Saw, I Conquered is also pretty badass too."

"What are you guys's guilty pleasure song/albums?","I mean I don't really feel ''guilty'' when I listen to it, but I like a lot of generic stuff, and I understand why it's bad and generic, but sometimes I like stupid chugging, breakdowns galore, and cookie cutter vocals.  Ex:  Asking Alexandria, Capture the Crown, Crown the Empire, Of Mice &amp; Men, basically just risecore

I just listened to her for the first time today, but give Charli XCX a shot. [My Own Body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Va-6_60-gg) and [Breaking Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fkt91iye4c) (song starts at 40 seconds in.)"

"Alex from Northlane is amazing","Bit of a longer story but I am so stoked on what happened. 

Northlane is touring with August Burns Red and they stopped by my city for a show, and normally I just show up and buy tickets at the door but to my surprise after waiting in line, the show was sold out...

So feeling distraught I am standing on the corner of the street outside the venue with my girlfriend feeling like an idiot for not buying a ticket prior to my favourite band (northlane) coming to town and am now thinking to myself I am going to miss out on them. 

I see Alex the bass player from northlane walking towards me coming out of a tour bus and as he walked by me I got his attention, shook his hand and told him my situation and asked if there was anything he could do. He told me to wait where I was and would see if he could figure something out...

He walks back out with his tour manager and two VIP band access passes and tells us to clip them to our pants and just follow his lead. So here we are walking right into the venue following Alex right through security and into the show where I finally got to see them live, which was absolutely amazing. 

Northlane has gotten me through some pretty tough times in my life and have motivated me unlike any other bands in a long time. Having this happen to me was sick! 

TL;DR: stupidly didn't buy tickets and found out the show was sold out. northlane snuck me and my girl inside and had an amazing night."
"Alex from Northlane is amazing","That's so cool.  I'm sure that was fun."

"Attention all Mesa, AZ, Frozen Flame Tour Attendees!","Does anyone need an extra concert buddy or want to make a Canadian friend?  I (24f) will be in town on the 22nd for the Frozen Flame Tour and I don't know anybody in Arizona!  I'll be arriving at the airport around noon on Sunday and cabbing it to the venue vicinity and wandering around till then, then after the show my general plan is to spend the night at the airport before my 2pm flight out on Monday.


I'm no noob to metal shows and this will be approximately my 9th time seeing ABR, so I know what to expect!  Hoping to make some new friends while I'm down south with you guys. Thanks!

Edit: Why am I going all the way down to Phx?  My hometown tour date sold out and Phx was the next cheapest available option to me.  You could say I REALLY love ABR."
"Attention all Mesa, AZ, Frozen Flame Tour Attendees!","If you really loved ABR, you would have gotten tickets before they sold out ;)

All jokes aside, I hope you have a great time :) Also, stay safe!"
"Attention all Mesa, AZ, Frozen Flame Tour Attendees!","This is true.  I deserve that quip, haha.  But they've never sold out a show in my hometown before, so I thought I'd be good to buy tickets right before the date!

But thanks for the warm wishes! :)  I'm looking forward to the amazing show plus escaping the cutting cold of winter for a few days, haha."
"Attention all Mesa, AZ, Frozen Flame Tour Attendees!","ITT: People that can't help you."
"Attention all Mesa, AZ, Frozen Flame Tour Attendees!",":( There's still a week before the show... Maybe my luck will turn around..."
"Attention all Mesa, AZ, Frozen Flame Tour Attendees!","I won't be at that date, but that sounds like fun! Last summer I went to Pennsylvania to see them (I live in Massachusetts) because that was the closest to me their summer tour was going, and I ended up having a great time"
"Attention all Mesa, AZ, Frozen Flame Tour Attendees!","Well I live in Tempe and was going to go but nobody I knew was going to the show so I said fuck it. This would have been exactly my 9th time seeing ABR as well. Oh well, I'm sure you can find some cool people to hang with down here."
"Attention all Mesa, AZ, Frozen Flame Tour Attendees!","What?!  You should come still!  I don't think it's sold out AFAIK.  Seriously, how can you miss out on [this](http://youtu.be/IZVHDPUf0k4?list=LL7KdP34wfGrQYkhiuuwhJIw)?!"
"Attention all Mesa, AZ, Frozen Flame Tour Attendees!","I cant go cause I just got diagnosed with epilepsy and can't handle the flashing lights anymore. I got to see them 5 times before so its okay. But I live right near if you wanna hang out with me and my friends after feel free and shoot me a PM. "
"Attention all Mesa, AZ, Frozen Flame Tour Attendees!","Man, that sucks!  Sorry to hear about that.  At least you've seen them before. :)  I may just take you up on that offer and PM you after the show, though!"
"Attention all Mesa, AZ, Frozen Flame Tour Attendees!","Hey! I'm going to be at the Mesa show!!! I'm driving down from flagstaff that morning. I'm bringing three other friends with me that day. It'll be my third time seeing ABR. And I got VIP! If your still looking to hangout with some people at the show, shoot me a message. We can get each other's numbers or something. :D"

I finally created an account to ask for a music video I saw here.
It was pretty new and was about somebody finding a treasure and going to the mountains or something. I really hope one of you guys can help me out :)"
"looking for a music video :)","do you have any more information?"
"looking for a music video :)","well it started at the beach and I now remember that it definitely ended in the mountains with him and the treasure, I also recall the unclean vocalist wearing glasses. thats the only thing that got stuck in my head  along with the melody of the song, which is why im trying to find it :/"

"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","Go to any local shows you have. "
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","find out if there's a metal club at a school near you and join it

better yet, start one

*if you build it, they will come*"
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","Can you do that? At my school there's like 1 metalcore kid and one osdm / melodeath kid and there's 2500 students here, hip hop and rap is what everyone listens to here."
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","find out what the process is to start a club and go for it! Usually they require a number of interested students to sign a document before officially becoming a club (at least in the states), but if you advertise you'll probably find some interested folks.

I'm currently the head of my uni's metal club and we did something similar to get started. "
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","I thought you and Verb the Noun were on a world tour for the whole school year?"
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","That might be better when I head to Uni as my school only has Christian and Asian groups pretty much but at the end of it, I could possibly put some banners or get it to be announced. I'm sure there'd be one at my uni otherwise I'll make it."
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","Have you spoken to all 2500 students?"
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","Nope but off the ones I know so I guess 500ish of them (well enough to know/guess there music taste) my school just isn't big on metal, hardcore or any of the subgenres well at least that I'm aware of. We had a post rock band last year which had dudes that listened to mean as music but they are gone."

"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","idk man. i'm sure there's a lot more metalcore kids than 1 in a school w/ 2500.  My school had at most like maybe 2000, and we had a dope scene with tons of hardcore kids"
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","I'm sure there's a lot more just I don't know them, my school is strict as like we all have to have short hair and wear a rigid uniform so it's really hard to tell off looks if someone likes the genre, the thing is also if i do find someone that likes metalcore/ post hardcore that don't even know the bands i like.  "
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","Gotcha. I know this sounds weird, but a lot of the kids in the scene I went to school with were kinda nerdy, so check out like card shops or like comic stores.

EDIT: you can also check local skate shops or local stores that might have local shows posted"
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","bruh i listen to PWD i'm a jock okay dude.

Nah haha i could kinda see why so, i couldn't go to either to be honest I'm just not that guy. I go to a few shows just generally its quite far away or its r18 (which won't be a problem soon) but my mate who's a bit younger has set up a black metal band so thats always good, I'm also kind of picky with core music like there is a lot crap out there in my opinion and it influences too much local bands haha thats just my mathcore view haha"
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","Local shows start talking to people, wear band shirts and see if people  know them, convert your friends haha"
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","Just like, say something about the band?  Like, ""Oh hey, you like Periphery?  What'd you think of their new album?""

I definitely would be open to meeting people in the scene, just don't want to come off as awkward or anything lol"
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","Yeah i understand you fully, i dont think ive ever seen a band shirt of a band that i like except for the La Dispute show, but just be like ""oh nice shirt, they are pretty sick [then ask them a question]"" i have felt like i haven't made many friend off the scene but i did find my last girlfriend (kinda) though i don't go to heaps of hardcore shows more alt rock  so different people i meet.

Good luck for you, I'm sure you have a better scene over there than here haha"
"How can I meet people that like metal around my area?","I mean, I'd love to have/friend a group of people to go to ""hardcore"" shows, but the scene is non-existent here in northern New York, lol.

I'll have better luck when I move to the Boston-area in a few months.  I know a LOT of bands usually swing through MA."

"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Serious question. Does an increase of fangirls have on impact on if you continue to listen to a band? From my experience they change a bands style and live performances, to a point that I cant stand the band anymore. Is this the same for anyone else? 
... Particularly BMTH and OM&amp;M, also the same for a lot of pop-punk bands"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I mean not really. Who am I to declare that young girls aren't allowed to like whatever bands I'm into? I mean there was a time when PTV were basically only popular with male posthardcore dorks and looking at how successful they are now I'd say that targeting the other 50% of the hardcore demographic was a really slick business decision."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","&gt; I mean there was a time when PTV were basically only popular with male posthardcore dorks

that...was me

and i still like them, things have changed since 07 though."

"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","http://www.stuffyouwillhate.com/2014/07/pierce-the-veil-most-jocked-band-2023/"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","i don't mind them. i'm just happy a band i like has a bunch of fans. especially if i've been listening to them for a few years. doesn't change the way i see the music. when i listen to a band that has a ton of fangirls that isn't what i think about. i just enjoy the album/song/etc.

HOWEVER, the shows are completely different. it does change the environment. that can ruin some of the movement of the show (stage diving, crowdsurfing, moshing) but it certainly doesn't hinder the performance of the band. just watching them is a-ok too as long as you ignore the hundreds of WOOOOOOO girls every time the vocalist says something. "
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","and who cares if you are meeting chicks who listen to the same music?"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Well to be fair most ""fangirls"" are under 18 but (in my opinion) going out of the way to pick up girls at hardcore shows is pretty inadvisable for a variety of reasons anyway. Plus in my experience you see just as much or more crowdsurfing and miscellaneous craziness at a SWS show as at an ABR show so the 'shows with lots of girls are less fun' mindset doesn't hold much water as far as I'm concerned."

"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","They don't ruin the band, but they have definitely ruined a few gig experiences. I rarely see metalcore bands because their fans usually infuriate me so much, both guys and girls."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I once saw a BVB show...no one knew the lyrics except for me. Worst concert."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Not at all. The bands music is the only thing that determines if I listen to them or not. Not what they do as people or what their fans do. "
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","This is the best attitude. Music is music. If you like it, you like it. Doesn't matter who it is ""supposed"" to pander to by societal standards."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","This is the only answer there should be. Bands dont really choose their own fanbase."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","they just make me ignore all the shtty fanart and comments"

During PtV the crowd seem to be all fan girls and woo's but as soon as BMTH got on stage dozens if not a hundred older guys came out of from nowhere and took over the crowd. It was kind of beautiful."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Most of the fangirls don't like BMTH, now that Oli isn't that super scene kid he used to be. Unless you are at warped tour, but that tends to be a crap ton of fan girls at every set. "

"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","That is pretty awesome"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I'll just say this: Black Veil Brides would be fantastic if it weren't for the fan base and singer (I just don't like his vocal style. I don't feel like it matches) the music is actually really good, but it's so heavy handed how much they pander to that 13 year old ""trying to be edgy gonna draw scars on my mouth to make people think I'm mysterious and edgy and cool"" demographic. If it weren't for those two things, they'd actually be great to be a fan of, because the musicians are actually incredibly talented."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I would have to say yes. I went and saw attila and a 15 year old girl kicked me in the balls because she got pushed. i don't mind them too much but they need to realize if there going to shove their way to the front then they should expect to be shoved and pushed with all the moshing and crowed surfing going on. Also its jut kind of lame being in my 20s and going to a show and and feeling like a grandfather there"

"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Suicide Silence was ruined by scene kids. "
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","That's what pissed me off the most. A bunch of scene kids who hated the band but jumped on Mitch's dick because he died and they wanted to feel like they had a connection."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Or Eddie Hermida, but we can agree to disagree"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","butthurt mitchbitch detected

everything Eddie did with ASP put suicide silence to SHAME. While it's unfortunate that Mitch died, You Can't Stop Me was the best suicide silence album since the Cleansing"

However this is why he should be downvoted. Insulting others because they expressed their opinion isn't cool."

"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","[deleted]"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Lol okay. I liked You Can't Stop Me but to say he put Mitch to shame is ignorant in itself. Mitch had better vocals than 99% of deathcore/metalcore both on album and in live performance. I don't know if you've ever seen Eddie live but he doesn't live up to Mitch and never will."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Do you even deathcore? 99% of vocalists are better than Mitch, not the other way around"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","And that's your opinion, his vocals are what made me really listen to deathcore in the first place. It's okay to like different things "
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","yea, Suicide Silence is a great beginners deathcore band, but to say they're the best in any category is just confusing"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","u wot m9

how can you say that when Phil Bozeman is a person that exists

I've seen both live and while Mitch definitely had a better stage presence Eddie's, he went above and beyond the bar set up by Mitch"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I like Whitechapel but I don't think Phil is the best, sorry. Don't crucify me. 

For my money, Mitch was the best live and Studio scream there was. Since he's gone I would say Rick from TOTA, Landon from Plot, Sam from Architects, or Ryan from Fit For A King are where my money would best be spent. That's my personal opinion though! I'm not trying to force my beliefs on you"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I honestly don't get the Landon worship on this sub. He sounds like every other Risecore vocalist"

"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I had a weird epiphany not too long ago when I realized that My Chemical Romance actually had a lot of really good songs, and I had only dismissed them because of their fans. I mean their image was cheesy for sure, and I still hate their last Killjoys album, but songs like Thanks for the Venom, Ghost of You, How I Disappear, etc. are really great examples of catchy but solid punk rock. They were good musicians and songwriters that just got bogged down with the emo scene, and probably Gerard's ego. "

"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Yeah my mum really liked MCR around Black Parade but it was ok i didn't mind Teenagers and Blood, those two were entertaining."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","[deleted]"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Just to echo what most people in this thread have said: they don't ruin a band for me if the music is still fine (like PTV, BMTH, ADTR even WCAR), but what typically happens is that these bands gain such a huge following, and whether its the constant touring, or the realization that they don't need to make good heavy music anymore (looking at you SWS, and OMAM) those band tend to fall off the rails a bit. And I completely echo the sentiment that they ruin shows. Completely, 100%. I'm at the PTV/SWS World Tour, just trying to get into Beartooth, and I have all these girls complaining we're getting to violent (trying to start pits). Then the entire show turns into people complaining that they're being squished and getting hot and sweaty. I'm still the guy who puts on his shitty clothes for a show because I want to go hard and get nasty and sweaty and a little beaten up. But all these girls show up all prissed up and wanting to sit in the front row...ugh. It kills me. Same shit always happens at Warped unless you're seeing something on a stage that doesn't draw girls. Sorry for my rant, I just felt really deprived that I could lose my shit to Beartooth. "
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Dude, Beartooth is top of my list of bands to see. They havent come to Australia yet so I'm still waiting. Hopefully they don't tour with some typical scene-kid bands."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Fingers crossed, God i want to see them so bad, maybe they could bring The Ghost Inside or vis versa I'd be so stocked :3"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","That would be amazing, The Ghost Inside, Beartooth, Northlane and Bury Tomorrow would be a dream tour"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","For me, it's based on how the band reacts to those fan girls. I still like bands like The Devil Wears Prada, Chelsea Grin, etc. that all have their share of bad fan girls, but if the bands don't try to market their music directly to those fan girls and make everything solely about profiting off of that demographic, I don't really mind."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I've always felt as though Prada has somehow managed to shoo away fangirls, at least the ones that we all probably find generally obnoxious."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Generally they do. "
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I don't really mind except at shows sometimes. The ones who want to be in the middle of the crowd but piss and moan when people mosh or start a push pit just irritates the fuck out of me. If you wanna go to shows your gonna have to get used to being pushed around a bit or get to the back."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Yes. Of mice and men.  Case closed."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I think it's the other way around..

As a band develops (often into a different direction than the ""old"" stuff), the new music might attract ""fan girls"".

For me bands like that either die a honorable dead (I still like the old stuff but won't go to shows or buy new stuff until they go ""back to the roots"") or I continue listen to them if I like the new stuff.

E.G. for the first case: BMTH. I can't stand that hard-pop stuff they're doing lately..
E.G. for the 2nd case: Rise Against. They've gotten progressively softer, but I still like most things they do. So, why not?

On concerts.. Just stay away from these kind of people and you'll be fine."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","You didn't like the black market?"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","As I said, I like all the albums. It's just that they have gotten softer and softer over the time."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Still so good though ^_^"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","It can kill a live show for sure. Way back in like 2005 I went to see Story of the Year. By no means was I expecting it to be a crazy show with a huge pit or anything, but I heard they put on a really good live show so I wanted to check it out. 

Band was great, audience was like 95% scene chicks, and me and a couple of my friends standing there. The audience definitely killed the show for me even though they sounded and played really good. "
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","This is a fair question. Most of the shows I've been to recently have been all fan girls. It bothers me some, because they just go to the front and don't jump or move and get when people by them bump into them. 
The difference between when I saw Issues headline and the whole crowd was fan girls to a very diverse crowd at a Beartooth show was night and day for me"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","[deleted]"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Nah I don't really care, I'll listen to whatever I want. What bothers me more is the endless bitching I see on Facebook and YouTube when a band changes their line-up or style. "
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Not really, as long as the band's music is still good. The only issue I have is when a band changes their sound (coughcough Of Mice &amp; Men and The Color Morale) to appeal more to the fangirls, and the quality of the music goes down greatly"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","but what if they think that we ruin shows for them?"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","We've also forgotten to mention that fan girls actually buy music, posters, dvds, magazines. Metal head guys steal the music, talk shit, pout at live shows and bitch about triggers in drums in YouTube. Fan girls are the only things worth doing it for"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I listen to the gear nerd technical side of metalcore mostly, like Periphery, Protest The Hero, After The Burial, Veil of Maya and such, so it's not usually a problem. However, those bands who do have fanbases like that usually don't get on my nerves, unless they're really preachy about it."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Good fucking god yes. 

I went to see OM&amp;M last year and I was like the only dude there, I was being elbowed senseless by 14 year old girls. So yeah, that sucked.

When I really like a band I tend to follow the members on social media, and I've had to unfollow members from bands like OM&amp;M, Pierce The Veil, MMF.... because their social media is just mad full of fan girls and ""Wrists are for bracelets, not cutting"" kinda quotes. Especially Matty Mullins. Fuck Matty Mullins.

I mean, yeah, obviously these fan girls can like whoever they want and they're entitled to, but they can just be really annoying."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Haha, fuck Matty Mullins and fuck tumblr, the source for the ""meaningful quotes"""
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Matty Mullins is a terrible person!"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Matty Mullins hates babies! Who hates babies??"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","No, I really don't care who else likes the band. However I tend to gravitate away from bands like PTV who direct their music towards that demographic. As for live shows security and push pits have ruined more shows for me than excited teenage girls ever will. "
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","For me it's not the fangirls itself, but how the bands handle them. Case in point, bands like Avenged Sevenfold or Black Veil Brides. I like the music for the most part, but I feel I would like it more if the band members weren't walking around like god's last gift. That being said, I suppose fans can turn me off, too. It took me forever to give bands like Tool or Opeth a chance because they were constantly being shoved down my throat. They didn't live up to the hype."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","The guys over with Avenged Sevenfold actually seem like pretty genuine dudes"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","while I agree that Opeth fans are annoying, trying to claim that albums like [My Arms Your Hearse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9X7BYsKUIc) aren't incredible is wishful thinking"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","ADTR has a ton of fangirls, and I still love them. As a general rule, though, I find that bands with a huge ""scene"" following or whatever end up not sounding as good. I've never liked either Oli Sykes's or Austin Carlile's vocal style. The same goes for bands like BVB and Falling In Reverse. Not to mention the fact that all the members of those kinds of bands are tools."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","[deleted]"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","What Pop Punk bands are you being put off out of interest?"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I still enjoy them, but two bands that come to mind are State Champs and Neck Deep. I know their lyrics gravitate towards a female audience, but still, they're pop punk bands where the crowd should be doing more then standing still and screaming"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Not at all honestly.  Nothing stops me from liking a band or a song other than the way that band/song sounds."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Nah, not really. I did at one point, but then I realized that disliking a band for that reason is petty."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","They do for elitists."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I honestly get more fed up with the people who judge a band based on the fangirls than the fangirls themselves.

Granted, there are times when it impacts the live set, and it's annoying as hell, but overall as long as the music is good, that's all I care about.

But in the context of bands changing their sound to please their fangirls (I'm looking at you SWS), then yes, they can ruin the band for me.

Blessthefall gained quite a few fangirls when they came out with ""Hey baby"" but theyre still my second favorite band. Moreso than ever in fact."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","No, but they can certainly ruin a show. "
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","They are ruining TAA for me. I cant even wear my TAA shirt without having emo girls ask me if I listen to them. OF FUCKING COURSE I LISTEN TO THEM."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","The worst part is when you have been a fan for a long time, Ive listened to TAA since Severed Ties and now all these scene kids are hoping on the bandwagon thinking that their songs are directly about them."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","I'll admit, I haven't listened to them for that long, but I was a fan of them far before Let The Ocean Take Me. They are an awesome band that used to make super great lyrics, but they have been infected with hopecore.

Still seeing them with in hearts wake on valentines day."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Your in for a hell of a show dude, saw them both two weeks ago. As long as you are able to manage avoiding the fan girls of course. Both are some of the best live bands I've ever seen."
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Sick! Now I'm pumped haha"
"Can fan girls ruin a band for you?","Fangirls being fans of a band don't bother me - they don't ruin the band for me at all.  However, they may ruin the concert experience.  That time ABR co-headlined with AA? Nooooo.  I went to Frozen Flame this year and it was fine.

By the way, I am a girl."

How do you feel about these guys?"
"Provoke, Destroy","They're from my area. Cool to see 'em get recognition on here!"
"Provoke, Destroy","that's awesome! but for sure, they just have such a crazy sound. i love it."

"Can anyone break down the intro drum fill on ""In Pursuit Of"" by Structures?","I'd ask /r/drums but I'm not too fond of the community. "
"Can anyone break down the intro drum fill on ""In Pursuit Of"" by Structures?","rack tom 1x snare 6x rack tom 1x floor tom 1x kick 2x snare+china 1x snare 3x

then this repeats immediately but you add four hits to your drum hoop/rim at the end for that clicky noise. I do it on my rack tom. 

I jam this song pretty regularly because it's really fun to play. I believe all of the notes up until after the kicks are triplet 32nd notes and then the remaining snares with the China included (and the rim hits the second time around) are 16th notes. take that with a grain of salt though because I'm not the best with notes and rudimentary stuff. anyways, hope this helps you out. cheers"

"Secret booklets in Northlane and In Hearts Wake albums?","So today UNFD put up a photo of the Earthwalker physical cd cover, showing a secret booklet hidden behind the disc tray. After looking at my own copy i found it and it contains what appears to be lyrics of a song. I checked some comments out on the photo and someone said there was binary hidden in Northlanes singularity.  Once again i checked it out to see if it is true, and found a booklet contain a graphic design with a couple pages of binary.

Since most album packaging has to be finalized ~ 3 months before the CDs land in store shelves, this is something that had to be planned while we were recording Earthwalker.

This line gives you the biggest clue:

""Mother and Father are part of the Whole; both are born from one fathomless soul.""

"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","With many bands part of the scene like August Burns Red, Memphis May Fire, Texas In July, For Today, how do you feel about the sudden rise of the scene?"
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","If the music is good, I don't care. "
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","I feel like this should be everyone's answer."
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","For starters, I'm pretty sure TIJ isn't a ""Christian band"" anymore, I think they just have some Christian members.

As far as the whole ""Christian scene"" goes, if you don't like it, don't listen to it. Bitching about lyrical content or preachiness won't change a thing. "
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","There are two parts to this question for me: Theologically and Musically.

Just from an objective music stance: Christian bands in the genre are just as talented as everyone else. I think that its interesting that a lot of the bands that have really grown, nurtured, and sustain the scene are Christian-influenced (TDWP, Underoath, August Burns Red, AILD, Norma Jean, ect). And I think the heyday of metalcore was also the heyday of Christian metalcore (between 2003ish-2010ish), and part of that was due to those bands. But I just think its because they're honest dudes who wrote music they loved, and that moved them and people connected with it. 

Theologically: I hate attaching religion to a band. We don't apply people's political preferences (outside of like anarchist, we don't have ""Republican"" or ""Independent"" bands) for the most part. So why should  I don't care if you're christian, jewish, muslim, atheist, or whatever. Is your music good? Do I enjoy it? Cool. Is it nice to have music that aligns with my beliefs, but it doesn't make or break something. The only difference is that I can freely use music with christian lyrical content as worship, but that's it. If I'm just jamming out to whatever, then it doesn't matter. At this token: I DESPISE music made for christians. If you're writing a song to sell to a specifically christian audience because you want to make a ""safe music environment"" for people, then I am repulsed by what you do. This goes for 90% of christian radio (not so much the metalcore scene). If you're writing a song of worship that's one thing, but a christian radio single? That's gross. I hate the artists (Third Day, Toby Mac, Newsboys) who play only christian shows for only christian audiences and makes globs of money. As a christian, we are called to live out the great commission, and if you aren't doing that, then something's wrong. Most of the bands in this scene are trying to do that and that's cool. I'm not a big fan when people are over preachy (For Today, recent Matty Mullins), and I think your actions/lyrics should do your talking for you. If you want to open yourself up to talk about the thing you believe with your fans that's more than cool. But let the music and your worship show people what your believe, don't shove a message down their throats (It goes both ways too. I've seen bands who are atheists be like ""Fuck God"" in between their songs and stuff, and that's not cool either.) Just be respectful and cool about what people believe, and just listen to music you enjoy. Well, there's my rant about this. I went to a Christian high school, and so I was constantly getting in arguments about my ""devil"" music, and that's why I have so much to say about it. "
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","I absolutely love the scene.  I'm a confirmed Christian (but by no means would force religion down anyone's throat), and love the way August Burns Red intertwines religion into the lyrics, I think it's unique and just cool.  "
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","I am in no way a christian but i have been jamming Phinehas lately and their lyrics are very christian but they rock so good i don't care."
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","I definitely like a bunch of Christian bands, but it really irritates me when Christian metalcore is labeled as a completely separate genre, or when Christian fans refuse to listen to any band that isn't Christian, even if the band isn't anti-religious at all "
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","I think people should do whatever they want when it comes to music. If they enjoy it, it's all good. Also, if I recall correctly Memphis may fire isn't Christian, they are just composed of christian members. "
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","I dunno man, when the majority of the lyrical content of their albums is about how awesome God is, I think it's safe to label them as a Christian band, regardless of what they say in interviews."
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","I haven't listened to all of their albums, just challenger. So that could very well could be the case. Maybe they're trying to avoid the ""label"" or whatever. "
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","Their newest album went full Jesus... Except that at times, Matty seems to think he's god himself.. "
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","Damn man, I'll have to check it out. "
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","I agree, Challenger wasn't as bad, I actually love that entire album, but their latest album just went a little to far with the Christian stuff.  I get it, it influences your song writing, but he went full preacher on that record."
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","I actually thought Challenger was rather solid too... The band can be pretty good when it wants to "
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","Yup, the intro song, Vices, Legacy.  I spent my entire summer listening to it when it came out.  Was super excited for their new album, and while there's a few songs I like, Challenger was by far the better album."
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","For sure. I highly respect the two-way vocalists (Shane Told, Jeremy McKinnon, etc) "
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","I think its interesting. I love how For Today and Motionless in White tour together. But the real question is, how long will it last. The scene has grow, but what is its peak? "
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","I love a lot of bands that just so happen to be Christian bands."
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","I'm totally fine with it, and I don't see why anyone should have a problem with it just as long as the lyrics aren't too preachy or puritanical. If you purposely avoid listening to a band just because they're Christian, then you're just as bad as the Christian that refuses to listen to atheist bands."
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","All depends on the band."
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","I think it's cool that we have bands that are free to express their ideas on religion (pro and anti) and be accepted either way, and also to accept each other regardless. The fact that For Today and Motionless in White have been on, what, three tours together now speaks volumes to the openness and welcoming nature of our scene, and I don't think we acknowledge that enough. "
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","To be honest it seems that a lot of bands use the tag 'christian' like some sort of marketing tool. I've heard in many interviews with different bands that labels often asks if they can label the band as christian band cause it'll bost album sales..."
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","There is nothing wrong with this type of christian metalcore, I consider ABR my favorite band and i have for almost 6 years. I'm not religious at all. i love their style and the power in Matt and Jakes lyrical writing. you shouldn't overlook a band because of what they believe. as for the ""rise"" there are just as many anti religious bands out there if not more"

"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","dislike it to a degree, but wouldn't really call this a new trend

and texas in july isn't a christian band anymore"
"What is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?","its better now that most christian bands arnt just faking it like most used to. Im not a christian but it bothered me how band with one christian member would just say the were christian to gain popularity."

"The Human Abstract ""Patterns"" video","It's been quite some time since I've listened to them. Did they get a new vocalist? The only thing I wasn't a fan of on Nocturne was their clean vocals, but this song is pretty awesome."
"The Human Abstract ""Patterns"" video","I like the cleans on Nocturne and Midheaven the best. Well idk they just fit really well with the sound they had. "
"The Human Abstract ""Patterns"" video","I feel like you either loved or hated those clean vocals. I always loved Travis's screaming in FFTL, so I'm glad he got a frontman gig, however short lived it was "
"The Human Abstract ""Patterns"" video","The vocalist is Travis Richter the guitarist/screamer for from first to last."
"The Human Abstract ""Patterns"" video","Oh no wonder I like it then. I was a big fan of Travis, and was one of the main reasons I liked FFTL. Guy's got a monster growl."
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","Preferably metalcore, but others too."
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","Saw unearth in a basement in Bakersfield in 2003-2004ish (Jerry's pizza). They actually played amazing! But, this Fuckin guy in the pit. So God damn sweaty with no shirt on and dreads all the way to his ass, I mean to each his own that's cool and it's your style but this guy was alllllllll over the pit. Multiple times I was either hit in the face by his dreads which smelled like you walked into an old musty house that hadn't been inhabited since the early 1800's. A few other times his arm/body was violently slammed/pushed into me... You know that part on the movie Along Came Polly, with Ben Stiller, where he's playing basketball and the sweaty guy gets all up in his face? [Yeah this fucking part right here,](http://media0.giphy.com/media/CSHgKfTzp2lCo/200.gif) that happened multiple times. This Fuck smelled like he hadn't showered in weeks. So, instead of watching unearth absolutely destroy their vicious solos and awesome breakdowns, I spent a majority of my time pushing this homeless smelling Fuck away from me. I'm all for going wild in pits, don't get me wrong. But Jesus Christ at least have some proper hygiene God damn it."
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","I went to Asking Alexandria's headliner a couple of months ago mostly to see Blessthefall. Blessthefall killed it, but when Asking Alexandria played, Danny was a drunk mess and couldn't even sing or scream properly, and also kept changing the lyrics to the songs. I also heard from someone else there that he kept trying to get girls in the front row to suck his dick. The one good thing about this was that after a few songs, I decided to leave, and ended up meeting Elliot from Blessthefall on the way out, and had a good conversation with him"
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","Not MY experience but I was at an A7X concert standing in line for merch and a girl walked by bleeding from the back of her head saying that some dude was first bumping with a spiked bracelet behind her and repeatedly hit her with it."
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","WTF? At every show I've ever been to, they either confiscate those kinds of things or won't let you in until you get rid of them. I've been to, I don't know, maybe 10-15 large shows? I guess that one slipped through."
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","[deleted]"
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","I saw Trivium open for Volbeat. I saw Trivium a few times before and they were excellent but this show was just miserable. The crowd was pretty much all old enough to be my parents and they didn't even pretend to give a damn about the opening band. Matt kept trying to get the crowd involved and literally gave up before the end of their set."
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","Some drunk chick passed THE FUCK OUT right on top of me and my friend. She was walking out of the crowd and she just stops right between my friend and I. Then she was down. We tried to catch her, however, a 26 year old ""bigger"" girl is hard to hold onto when its dead weight for two 18 year olds. We just kinda held her there for a sec and then this huge bouncer came over and picked her ass up and got her out of there. Very strange experience because her bf was like ""BABE CMON WE GOTTA GO- OH SHIT"". At least Dayschell was pretty good lol "
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","My first ever concert was Trivium/Coheed and Cambria/Slipknot.  I was so excited.  I had been counting down the days for months.  I went with a good friend of mine who I also worked with.  Since it was my first show I was pretty nervous/anxious.  It was November I believe so it was cold.  I wore a jacket, but quickly realized once I got inside that there was nowhere to put that jacket and I certainly wasn't going to need it anymore... so I decided my only option was to just drape it over my shoulders and carry it.  Kind of annoying, but not a huge deal.  Until Matt from Trivium during the first song says ""When we get to such and such part of this song, I want this place to FUCKING ERUPT!"" or something along those lines.  And when he did, it was kind of like a movie.  Everything started moving in slow-motion as everyone turned around to see what they were dealing with.  So the part comes along, and since my arms are holding my jacket I find myself immediately on the floor.  It's hard to keep traction when you have no balance on top of spilled beer and popcorn literally covering the floor.  Someone offered me a hand to get up thankfully, however I noticed I lost one of my shoes.  I had to swim through a sea of legs and fight to get it back.  I could hardly breathe because there was so much pot smoke in the air (no offense to stoners/smokers) and I was just not having a good time.  So I opted out to sitting up in the stadium seats for the rest of the show after paying $4 for a bottle of water that had to be poured into a cup.  Aside from all that, all 3 bands were amazing and put on a hell of a show.  "
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","I saw TAIM and I Declare War at chain reaction and ended up getting a concussion. I Declare War demanded the lights get turned off while everyone moshed/hxc danced to make everything more extreme. Before I knew it I got my head slammed by a fist and got knocked the fuck out. Ended up with a huge gash on my head. Still had a great time but it seriously hurt."
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","Dick move by the band imho"
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","Literally two days ago. The Frozen Flame tour in Milwaukee at The Rave. First off let me say it's not because of the bands the show was fantastic. It had to do with security at the place. They were posted up right in the middle of the pit the whole show. Ip there was a solid 7-8 of them right in the middle shutting every thing down. They were the types of dude who go home and beat off to Muscle Fitness with a needle in their ass. Throughout the show the would just be pushing kids, choke holds, kicking kids out for jumping and having a good time. Well during ABR their total fucking douche nozzle boss comes out and puts a kids who had to be 30-35 years his junior. That seemed to be the final straw with just about everyone. Me and about 5 other kids jumped on the guy. That kinda put an end to the chokes but not a end to the useless shoving and total asshole shit they did all night. Oh, I forgot about the guy who wanted to kick me out for not watching my elbows while he had his hands on me. So if you live anywhere around there never go trust me you'll have a terrible time being bullied by security and paying $6 fucking 50 for a can of monster at a all cash bar. "
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","I was there and up in the balcony! The security was bullshit. I saw one of my buddy's in the crowd getting man handled just for rocking out and having a good time. Horrible new policy or whatever it is. "
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","I was talking to one of them about why and apparently they have like 40 million in lawsuits and the city wants to shut it down. I immediately was like why the fuck are you guys booking this then?"
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","Ah man, that kind of sucks though because outside of the metal grill the rave is all we got in the area. You hardly see anymore shows around Madison and if you're further north there is like almost no shows.  "
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","Honestly, I much rather not have shows that do that again. It's not worth it. Straight up I advise not going there anymore. The only reason I went is because there was no Chicago date. It seems like Chicago is hell of a lot more relaxed. The house of blues in Chicago is one of the best places to see a show hands down. Security are some of the nicest guys who I have come across."
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","Haha wow! I had no idea they had that many lawsuits but I'm guessing they only do that for shows where they know there'll be moshing because I was at Manson last night and there weren't any guards in the crowd. It was also upstairs in the ballroom though. "

"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","This may come as a surprise, but Korn. They were co-headling with Disturbed, who were awesome by the way. This was just before Disturbed went on hiatus. People started leaving after Korn's first few songs because they were just terrible. Then, the lead vocalist got mad at the audience because we weren't being ""energetic enough"". He was really pulling some Ronnie Radke-esque stage attitude that day. I left after that. "
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","About 6 years ago I saw Daughtry (I was 13 so cut me some slack) and I was really into it and all- I still only listened to what was popular on the radio at this time, hence why I was at this show. So I'm singing these songs pretty hard and having a great time until this lady in front of me turns around and LOSES HER SHIT because I ""spit in her face"" while singing.

In my defense I generate a ridiculous amount of saliva and I've apologized numerous times to people at shows for accidentally spitting on them, but this lady was not having it.

Just imagine being at any kind of show and seeing a middle aged woman SCREAMING at a 13 year old boy. I guess shitty music just attracts shitty fans."

"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","Me &amp; a friend went to see Chvrches live a few months back. 

The gig itself was great, Chvrches was awesome. But the crowd was kinda 'Meh' compared to most gig i went to. That kinda killed it for me. There was one guy beside us who did not move an inch throughout the concert. He just stood there like a plank while everyone was jumping around.

I have not been to a metalcore concert before, but i would want to in a near future."
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","Chvrches are amazing! I am surprised anyone could stand still during one of their sets, their music makes you want to move."

"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","Saw ETID and Acacia Strain. After the show, I accidentally bumped into this dude. He was obviously drunk, but made several racist remarks to me and threatened to fight. That ruined a pretty alright show, but I'm fortunate that most other shows have been great."
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","This is my worst and its not at all bad, I was just at alt rock/ fuzz rock gig and there was like 50 people inside and for some strange reason there was this guy with a bandana who took the pit too far and was trying to hurt people, and eventually it lead to me getting whacked hard in the head and feeling dazed for awhile. If this was at a hardcore show I wouldn't mind too much but he was far too hateful, especially for the type of music.

Other one would be almost passing out at the La Dispute concert due to dehydration, as I was jamming to Balance and Composure before their set I picked up a sweat and I couldn't last the whole night so I went from pretty much the front to sitting in the back drinking to get my sight back haha"
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","I've been crowdkilled a few times, but nothing really really bad."
"What is the worst experience you've had at a concert?","Mine was Bon Jovi a few years back at Soldier Field in Chicago, he started ""Living on a Prayer"" too early and he just looked down and walked away.  The entire stadium had a collective cringe.  I felt bad for the guy."

"Bands that tune lower.","I have been looking for some bands that tune drop a and lower. I know Northlane and Volumes. I'm was wondering if any bands do this with a more traditional metalcore sound. I have been jamming on my 7 string and see so many possibilities for this."
"Bands that tune lower.","In metalcore that use 7+ strings:

* After The Burial 

* Betraying The Martyrs

* Glass Cloud

* Northlane

* Periphery

* Reflections

* Structures

* Upon A Burning Body

* Vildhjarta 

* Volumes

* Within The Ruins (unless they just tune really low on a 6 like G or something)

Probably a lot more but idk any at the top of my head

"
"Bands that tune lower.","Thank you!! And yeah within the ruins for some reason always use 6 strings tuned way low. OP could tune a 7 to it "
"Bands that tune lower.","They used a [6 string in G for Elite](http://www.metalsucks.net/2013/03/08/rigged-within-the-ruins-guitarist-joe-cocchi/), [and a 7 string on Phenomina](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/27szt2/we_are_joe_and_tim_of_within_the_ruins_ask_us/ci47wnq)"
"Bands that tune lower.","Messugah and Mastodon both at times are lower than Drop A but not metalcore "

"Bands that tune lower.","Hmm I'm not too sure about how lowly tuned this is,but tell me if this [suits you](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu13IpcD4mE) if it isn't low enough could you just tell me what drop it is haha"
"Bands that tune lower.","It's either C or B, B is more common, so I'd say probably that one."
"Bands that tune lower.","I think B as Dreams in Inertia is drop B  I think on Ultimate Guitar"
"Bands that tune lower.","Oh man, Mastodon is pretty much my favorite band right now. So sick!"

"Bands that tune lower.","I think architects tune that low but they use 6 string guitars if I'm not mistaken"
"Bands that tune lower.","I think in their last album, most of the songs were in C# standard with the 6th string tuned to G#, and in Gravedigger F#"
"Bands that tune lower.","Architects use Drop G iirc"
"Bands that tune lower.","Kublai Khan, The Acacia Strain"
"Bands that tune lower.","I don't think I've seen it in here but Breakdown of Sanity uses a lot of drop A. So does The Ghost Inside and I think In Hearts Wake. "
"Bands that tune lower.","Some of BMTH's sempiternal stuff was Drop A. Not heavy, but low. A lot of OM&amp;M's new stuff too. Crown the Empire's new album was mostly drop A# and A."

"Bands that tune lower.","Its the new thing."
"Bands that tune lower.","Pretty sure BMTH have always had stuff in A, especially since they used to play deathcore "

"Bands that tune lower.","most of SS and There is a Hell was drop A#, but definitely with some Drop A. And I think Count Your Blessings was Drop B, but I'm just basing that off of Pray for Plagues, so I could be wrong."
"Bands that tune lower.","The Amity Affliction tunes low a lot of the time. "
"Bands that tune lower.","Kublai Khan, Barrier, Code Orange, Villians. "

"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","Such a damn good band, dude. Good share."
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","I love them so much, I'm so hyped for their new album"
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","Favourite Make Them Suffer song, so good."
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","Just listen to Defeater"
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","Got them mate, Empty Days And Sleepless Nights is my go to album."
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","Just listened to that one tonight, so great"
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","For moods like this, a lot of Melodic Hardcore comes to mind. 
Bands like Counterparts as you mentioned and 
Hundredth
Being As An Ocean,
Hotel Books"
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","I know BAAO and Hundredth, seen em live and love them, I'll check out Hotel Books."
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","Try out The elijah, has the clean vocalist from BAAO in it."
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","Pretty much anything by Like Moths to Flames and The Plot In You."
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","Quite like Plot, only really know Could You Watch Your Children Burn though, is First Born sadder?"
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","IIRC First Born is sort of a concept album dealing with domestic violence/abuse. It is a good album, worth checking out imo."
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","""Ankle Deep Ocean"" by Mozart Season"
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","That was brilliant, thank you."
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","Most of them lol. 

In seriousness, 
anything by Sworn In
Demons - For All Those Sleeping
The Sadness Will Never End - BMTH
Don't Go - BMTH
"
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","Sworn In is extremely negative. Some people think they try too hard but you can decide that for yourself. "
"Songs about regret/self loathing/depression?","I would disagree with those people, I think they're/Tyler's just being honest."

"First metalcore show you ever went to?",""
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Game Changers Tour in 2011 with A Day To Remember, Bring Me the Horizon, We Came As Romans &amp; Pierce the Veil. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","That was mine too, really awesome lineup looking back on it."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Same. I actually won tickets to the show, too. I listened to ADTR a lot and tried to get into PTV before seeing them live.  I didn't like PTV at all until seeing their live show, and WCAR tore it up too. I instantly got their first album after I went home.  This was probably one of my favorite shows ever, all genres included."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I'm guessing I'm the oldest one here. It's hard to remember exactly what my first metalcore show was, but one of my first ones has to be back in 1996 or 1997. I saw Living Sacrifice, Jesus Freaks, and Elliott (who changed their name to Eso-Charis...Corey from Norma Jean was the vocalist) down in Nashville at Rocketown. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Not counting Warped tour, it was August Burns Red, Blessthefall, Defeater, and Beartooth in fall 2013. Still one of the best shows I've been at

Edit: Before that, I did go to Warped tour in 2012 and 2013 though"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Did you have that awkward ""I don't know what to do with myself"" moment your first time in the pit? "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Not really, since the first pit I was in was I See Stars' pit at Warped tour, and it wasn't too crazy, just a lot of people jumping, so I just went along with that and it was pretty fun, then later that night I went into ABR's pit, and that was a bit crazier, but still really fun"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Ahh lol first thing I encountered was a wall of death to 2012 by TWA...."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Ah, yeah, that would be an interesting first pit experience"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","First pit I was ever in was I See Stars at Warped Tour aswell. Fucking love ISS."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I'm not really into them anymore, but at the time they were one of my favorite bands"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Same dude! Such a good show. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","ABR in 2012 was my first warped tour/metal core show
And since they were my favorite band I went into the pit, sadly as soon as I got in I got elbowed in the nose and started bleeding like crazy and had to sit it out. 

Still the best show I've ever been to. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","They had some crazy tours in 2012, sadly I didn't really get into them until 2013"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","They did. I've seen them every year except last because they didn't come to my state last year and it only gets better"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I got into them a little before Rescue &amp; Restore came out, and I've been to a show on every US tour they've done since then, even though I had to go out to Pennsylvania for their summer mini-headliner, since it went nowhere near where I live (Massachusetts), but since it was the middle of summer, I thought a road trip would be a good idea, and it ended up being a great show and definitely worth it"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Saw them minus Beartooth later that tour.  I was really disappointed that Beartooth wasn't opening, but Blessthefall and ABR were both awesome.  That was my second show, with the first being letlive, Texas In July, Silverstein, and ABR in winter 2012."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Jeez I feel old here reading most of the comments... 
My first was maybe 2003-2004ish, Norma Jean headlined with The Agony Scene, The Beloved, and Figure Four. Just about the time that ""Bless The Martyr and Kiss the Child"" had been released. Shit was absolutely crazy."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Same beloved that made death to traitors? "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Sure is, awesome song by the way."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","ahh okay yea that song was so good, unfortunately the only song I know from them. Can you recommend another one?"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","They only had two albums but I still jam them all the time. I'm on my phone so lmk if this doesn't work but their first release, [The Running,](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDB0E89026043798C) is an awesome listen. Their second album, [Failure On](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RisQon7og1I&amp;list=PL0ivlkG7Rj556lm8MiKIEsfyToNGHGrMK) is my personal favorite, also the album that has the song you mentioned. (Death to Traitors.) One of my favorite bands of all time, you should totally listen to both of those albums."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","That sounds like an awesome show. i fuckin love The Agony scene. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","You are so lucky. I wish I could go back in time to see them that early"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Me too! I saw NJ shortly after they had released BTMKTC. One of the most powerful performances I've ever seen live. They translated the raw energy from the album perfectly to the stage and a lot of people got fucked up. Was great. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","For me it was October of 2011:

Bring Me the Horizon

Parkway Drive

Architects

And, Deez Nuts

Hands down, one of the best experiences of my life, and glad my first concert was those guys. This concert enhanced my growing love of metalcore at the time"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Holy fuck I saw this tour! I knew i'd seen Architects at some point."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","[Thrash and Burn tour in 2010](http://www.metalsucks.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/thrashandburn2010.jpg)

Sad to say I was going mostly for AA..."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","For some reason I vividly remember that poster design, even though I didn't go and haven't thought about it in like 5 years."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","It was pretty sick. It got me into a lot lc those bands, because I was just starting to really listen to these genres. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Sad to say? AA was good in 2010"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I wouldn't say good, but I did enjoy them at the time. Not so much anymore. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Dead Throne Tour in Australia 2011 it had The Devil Wears Prada, We Came As Romans, and Dream On Dreamer."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Not necessarily Metalcore but I saw Insomnium and Dark Tranquility back in January. However I did see Dillinger open for Soundgarden and Nine Inch Nails in August last year. I dont know if that counts :/

"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Mine was the Dead Throne tour with TDWP, Whitechapel, Enter Shikari, and For Today. It's still one of the best shows I've ever seen "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Sounds like it hot damn "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I still resent the fact that that tour never came near me, because TDWP with Whitechapel sounds unreal."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I saw Lamb of God, Killswitch Engage, DevilDriver, and Soilwork back in 2007. It was on the anniversary of Dimebag's death, so at the end of the show they all came out and played 5 Minutes Alone by Pantera! That set the bar pretty high for my first metal show! [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVFH5uK0Jhg) a video of them performing it. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Went to see BFMV with Atreyu and Bring Me in 2009. It was a great show. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Seeing as I'm from Ocala, Florida, my first show was A Day to Remember and Underoath back when they were still more of local bands. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","2011 with A Day To Remember, August Burns Red,The Ghost Inside and Living With Lions"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Really wish I could've gone to that tour, sadly it was in Europe and I wasn't even into this genre at the time"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","We Came As Romans in London Ontario September 2012. Abandon all Ships and Ice Nine Kill opened.

The room was pretty empty. The 'pit' was two guys fighting invisible ninjas, the rest of the crowed was pretty docile. Probably the worst crowd I've been in. WCAR still had a great performance though."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","saw this show in st kitts without ice nine....crowd was good bands were mucho meh"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Back in I think 2009 I saw The Devil Wears Prada, A Day to Remember, Sky Eats Airplane and Emarosa and it was the first metalcore show I have ever been too. Blew my mind. Right before Roots came out so the setlist was basically Plagues, a few songs off of Dear Love and a few new ones off Roots."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","My first (and only) metalcore show was in January 2012. Metalcore bands rarely ever play here in Norway, and I'm not much of a concert goer anyway. But I decided to drag my friends along for a weekend trip to London.   The show was Asking Alexandria, blessthefall, Chelsea Grin and With One Last Breath. We ended up missing WOLB and CG because the queue was damn long, so we waited with some beers in the pub nearby. I met Eric from btf at the bar, and probably made a fool of myself (drunk). Both blessthefall and Asking Alexandria put on a great show, though I'd say btf were better performers. All in all a great show, and even my friends who aren't really into metalcore had a good time."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","depends what counts...

Warped Tour 2004 10th Anniversary show in Boston, Avenged Sevenfold played, still using the harsh vocals.  Blew my mind as I was really into those guys.

Oct 25, 2005 - Avenged Sevenfold City of Evil headliner at The Palladium in Worcester, MA.  They played M.I.A., Wicked End, Strength of the World.  First of a plethora of shows I've attended at that venue...and that count has grown every year by a handful.

Mar 10, 2006 - Haste The Day, Bleeding Through, Between the Buried and Me, and Every Time I Die show at The Palladium."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I saw Of Mice &amp; Men on their first headliner.  They were with ISMFOF, Woe, Is Me, Sleeping with Sirens, and The Amity Affliction.  It was pretty awesome."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I was at that too! Fucking amazing show. Mine was in Chicago. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","The Devil Wears Prada, ADTR, Emarosa and Sky Eats Airplane back in May(?) of 2009 I believe. The Pulling Your Pud Tour later that year was a lot better. Even got to meet the entire band before the show, that was amazing. 

Edit: I feel like I'm dating myself with this but the first ""show"" I actually went to was The Fall of Troy at this piece of shit bar called Saratoga Winners back in 2006. Fuck I'm old. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Asking Alexandria and Born of Osiris in 2010 at the Rave in Milwaukee. Danny asked for 20 bras on stage before they would play an encore and he ended up getting it. Turns out there was a chick who took off everything except for her panties in the front row and he called her on stage despite the security guards trying to keep her down. She got up there and showed the whole crowd her tits, and then AA started the song. It was fucking crazy and I haven't seen anything like it at the 30+ shows I've been to since. There's a YouTube video of it somewhere, but it's been edited to cut off before that part happens. 

Edit: [Found it](http://youtu.be/zVHKPioyKaw)

She was insanely hot. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","with all that remains I think I went to this in toronto, only for born of osiris, worth it"

November 2011."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I saw Memphis May Fire a few years back just after they put out Challenger. I was way up front and I distinctly remember being kicked in the head twice by crowd surfers. Needless to say I have gone back for more."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Mine was the Haste the Day farewell tour with MyChildren Mybride, The Chariot, and A Plea for Purging. 3/4 bands have broken up now and they are definitely all three in the list of my favorite bands. That was where I fell in love with the genre and started to get into every metalcore ,deathcore, hardcore, or melodic hardcore band known to man."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","My first was in 2011. A Skylit Drive, Animals as Leaders, and Thursday opened for Underoath. It was a phenomenal show!"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I think it was Scream it Like You Mean it 2012. The show had Attack Attack!, WCAR, Woe is Me, Abandon All Ships, etc. It was a long ass show. "

"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I saw Killswitch Engage once, but as far as like modern metalcore type of stuff I guess I guess it would have been Motionless in White/Capture the Crown/Asking Alexandria.  Feel like I'm forgetting someone but can't remember.  "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","As I Lay Dying, All that Remains, and Haste the Day back in '07. My friend and I had our parents drive and everything hahah we were like 15. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Killswitch Engage, Every Time I Die, &amp; Parkway back in 2008. It was fucking awesome! "

"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Ap Fall Tour 2010 August Burns Red, BMTH, Emarosa (with Johnny Craig), Polar Bear Club and This Is Hell."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Looks like an interesting lineup"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","It was awesome. 2012 I believe and it was We Came As Romans, Miss May I, Of Mice &amp; Men, Texas In July, and Close to Home. Easily still the top show I've ever been to. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","August Burns Red with Of Mice and Men, The Color Morale, and Overseer at the House Of Blues Anaheim. Sick show, first time throwing down

"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Back in '09 I saw ADTR, ABR, Enter Shikari, and Silverstein it was a badass show."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","That's a pretty nice lineup"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","The best part was when Enter Shikari threw condoms in the crowd, and said ""don't worry we got you covered."""
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I saw All That Remains open for Hollywood Undead ages ago at my first show ever.

First all-core show was Falling in Reverse, Enter Shikari and letlive.

First *all-metalcore* show was the Break Down the Walls tour early last year. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","The Break Down the Walls tour was definitely a fun one"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Warped your was first festival, but my first show was The Color Morale, For today, The Devil wears prada, and As I Lay Dying. It was so sick."

"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I loved that concert"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","It sucks Palisades couldn't make it. But I did see them on the Not Your American Idols tour."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Palisades was at the Richmond, VA stop and I must say they are the nicest guys I've ever met."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I highly agree with this statement."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","First show was A day to remember's right back at it again tour. It was Them, Of mice &amp; men, and issues. 
It was pretty crowded and I was scared at first but it was quite the experience.
I've been going to a show at least once a month ever since (:"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","a day to remember"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","We Came as Romans and a bunch of local bands. WeCAR and like 2 of the 6 or so other bands were good. Rest was pretty awful. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","I See Stars and Abandon All Ships way back in the day. Fucking awesome time that was"

It was during the MySpace era so that's how I found them. Shame they stopped though I really dig their stuff. Granted they only had like 3-4 songs haha
"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Ha! I live in Lewisville. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Parkway Drive, I Killed The Prom Queen, Northlane and Survival. 22nd of December 2012 at Festival Hall MLB. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Parkway Drive and The Ghost Inside. There were two other bands that I can't remember. Both The Ghost Inside and Parkway Drive completely blew my mind. The breakdown for Between the Lines at that show is one of, if not the, beat live experiences I've ever had. That shit shook the entire building. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","This Is A Family Tour (2010)- Attack Attack, Emmure, Pierce the Veil, Of Mice and Men, In Fear and Faith. One for the books right there"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Just some local gig, it was average haha"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Feeling a bit old but It was parkway drive doing a free show in 2005 or 2006 just before they went on their first American tour. "

"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Yeah i met some of the guys from Affiance. They're pretty chill."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","As did I. Denis walked off stage super nonchalantly and we chatted about what it was like touring at this point in their careers and how they were liking Western Canada. Awesome guy. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Yeah i talked a bit with the guitarists. He was tired after the show but it he was pretty happy for how it went."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Holy shit, I feel old reading these. My first metalcore concert was when I saw Unearth, Killswitch Engage (who were promoting TEOH) and Slipknot (who were promoting Subliminal Verses). This was in 2004 at the PNE Forum in Vancouver, which is a huge barn, essentially. The place was fucking wild as Slipknot was at the top of their stage game at this point. 

Seeing KSE blew me away and led me to discover AOJB. And the rest is history. "
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","We Came as Romans in late 2012 in my city! I saw them the summer of 2013 at warped tour as well. Really different shows, one was small and felt more personal cause it was a small venue at the time, and warped was much more energetic cause of the massive crowd."

"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Was it the Break Down the Walls tour? That had Asking Alexandria, August Burns Red, We Came as Romans, Crown the Empire, and Born of Osiris"
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Yeah! That was it. I got kicked out right after WCAR so I didn't pay much attention."
"First metalcore show you ever went to?","Ah, damn, you missed a great show from ABR"

"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","We all know this song has SO much potential, but it just sounds off due to production or something of the sort. So which songs are those for you?"
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","All of Count Your Blessings"
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","If Oli could power through it, I'd pay good money."
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","All of Thrill Seeker by August Burns Red, redoing the vocals with Jake wouldn't be bad either"
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","That would be awesome!  It would be super cool if JB revamped some of the riffs too."
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","That could be cool too, though I think the riffs are pretty good as they are, it's more the vocals that I have issues with"
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","Thrill Seeker sounds great as it is. Josh McManness was a beast on that album too. I don't want them to rerecord it even as a huge ABR fan. "
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","I just wasn't a huge fan of Josh's vocals or the production on that album"
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","Northlane-Keymaker


Parkway Drive-Dead Dreams


All of Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord by The Devil Wears Prada

"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","I honestly think if TDWP tried to re-record Dear Love it wouldn't work at all. Their sound is way too different at this point."
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","Maybe not necessarily a ""remastering,"" but I'd like to see Our Last Night re-record some of their oldest stuff now that they're all older and sound much better. Back on the first record, Trevor was 12-13 and the uncleans were pretty bad. Post-pubescent Trevor, however, has an amazing unclean voice. Imagine Escape re-recorded with him now. Eargasm. "

Still would love to hear Trevor's screaming on that.

"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","The burial plot war unbidden by Every Time I Die, despite what I've read on the internet I really enjoyed this ep and I have bought the remastered one I think but it still could have a lot of work. What I really like about it, is that the vocals are like a mix of Code Orange Kids and Converge. Here is a [song so you can tell for yourself](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L9dUuMWHzm4)"
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","Reflections' Exi(s)t needs to be remastered. Like right now. Eyal Levi is a god awful producer. Also Chelsea Grin's Desolation of Eden. Tim Lambesis fucked that album up badly."
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","What's wrong with Desolation of Eden? Exi(s)t doesn't sound too bad, IMO The Fantasy Effect could use a remaster much more than Exi(s)t."
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","Both albums by Reflections clip like a motherfucker"
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","What do you mean by clip?"
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","Clipping is a form of waveform distortion that occurs when an amplifier is overdriven and attempts to deliver an output voltage or current beyond its maximum capability. 

It's like when there's too much bass is sounds like horrible buzzing "
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","Ahh okay. Yeah I agree, both Reflections albums do have that issue. Honestly I just thought that was a style they were trying to go for."
"Which songs would you like to hear a remastered version of?","If you listen to them with subs, it sounds terrible "

"Sarea - ""Another Me""",""
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Basically, which vocalist do you think isn't nearly as good as they were earlier in their career."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Every one says Garret from The Color Morale. I never really listen to them, but his vocal change is noticeable. 

"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Austin Carlile"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","My first thought when I saw the thread. I don't think anyone can dispute it. "
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I think he still has it , he's just taking a shitty fucking direction trying to be one of those uplifting bands teens listen to to feel better. It's a shame that this is how they followed up the flood. Even after Shayley left those 4 songs on the reissue sounded pretty damn good and super heavy. Also they ruined Aaron pauley"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Definitely Garrett Rapp, his cleans are still great, but his ""screams"" are terrible now"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","And his cleans suffer because of his screams. "
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I have no idea about that, the cleans on the last album still sounded pretty good, thought not like they were on My Devil in Your Eyes, no idea about what they're like live now though, since I've never seen them"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I liked his screams on know hope. They gave the band a refreshing edge , that being said the touring and trying to write a second album within the year ruined his voice for good. Apparently he's shit live now. "
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","[deleted]"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Cleveland Brown bot*"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","In my opinion, Mike Hranica. It may be blasphemous but I just really couldn't get into 8:18 and even parts of Dead Throne because I felt that his voice just became hollow to me. I REALLY enjoyed Plagues and WRAABB, they just seem to have more passion and emotion."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","On top of that, he only hits about 60% of the lyrics live and is unable to sustain a scream for more than 2-3 seconds. "
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","when i saw tdwp live the instrumentals completely took over his voice. like you could barely hear the screams"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","As much as it kills me, I have to agree with you. "
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Gonna second Mike. I loved his vocals on their first few albums. One of my favorite harsh vocalists. But now his voice is so shrill and it sounds like he inhaled helium before screaming. 

And to add my own: Tomas Lindberg, he's not metalcore, but he's gone downhill."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I have to say Craig Mabbitt. I really liked him when he was in Blessthefall, but I don't think he's nearly as good in Escape the Fate as he was back then."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Have you heard of Dead Rabbitts? I'd say he's better than he was in BTF/TWA with the new DR album."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Yes, Shapeshifter's great"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I really like Ungrateful by Escape the Fate still, I used to listen to them all the time but I kind of outgrew it, that's when I was a scene kid, though. So glad I left that phase lol"

Matty Mullins (Memphis May Fire)

"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Say what you like about Matty Mullins,  but he's a great vocalist."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I just think he sounded better on Challenger over Unconditional, especially with [Vices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_yCTsL3pOU)"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","While I've never been a huge MMF fan, I think one of the main reasons the vocals on Unconditional were so bad was the terrible production on that album"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","[deleted]"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I've been saying this since Unconditional came out. The dude is an egotistical douche who unironically wears fedoras and loves jesus, but he has a killer fucking voice."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Definitely agree with them. But I don't necessarily think Oli has gotten worse. His low grows are insanely good now. Its just his highs that are a bit worse."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I think he's gotten better at singing and his screams still sound good, but if he could mix the way he sings now with the screams he had on Suicide Season, it would be amazing"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I have to disagree about Levi Benton, sure, his voice sounds a lot rougher, but I still really enjoyed their last album, and when I saw them last month, he sounded great"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I like their last album too, and I saw them a few weeks ago too and thought they were great, I just think he was better on AAFtW and Monument"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I actually liked their new album the most, but I definitely thought Monument and AAFTW were better than At Heart"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","The clean vocals are what ruin Miss May I after AAFTW for me... I still like Levi's screams through all their material."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I thought the cleans on Monument were their best, and the other albums they were just sort of meh, I mostly listen to them for the screaming and riffs, not the cleans anyway"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Not sure if the guy from Abandon All Ships was ever good, but now he's just awful"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","He was always shit. He just got progressively shittier. "
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","The only progressive thing about Abandon All Ships"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Sick burn."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Matt Tuck, oh Jesus has that gone downhill. Garret Rapp and Telle Smith have also had a drop in quality from what I've heard."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Matty Mullins. Not because his screaming's got worse, just that it sounds much more produced now. He used to be one of my favorites."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","They (MMF) have said that they disliked the production of the last record, so that could change on the next one, hopefully. "
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I'm pretty sure Matty actually built a studio with that guy, he's probably going to keep doing their albums."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I can't tell if Telle Smith has gotten worse, or if his harsh vocals were just layered so heavily back on their first couple albums that he sounded much more capable than he actually was. Whatever the case, his mid and low ranges are pretty mediocre now. His highs are still sweet though."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I dunno man, Telle's live performances during the past couple years are the only reason I even own any TWA albums to begin with. "
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I don't think he's bad at all, his higher end live is intense for sure, but the growls we heard on Deceiver are gone."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?"," I kind of get the gist that he was never really comfortable in the low range and that Deceiver only gave an impression that he was through production.  Either way Telle sounds great live and his voice fits the music well."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Deceiver definitely sounds better vocally than Life Cycles or Real, not sure what's up"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","There was a lot less/almost no effects or production on his voice on Life Cycles or Real. "
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","going to be an unpopular opinion here but I loved Caleb's vocals back in the S/T AA album. I guess he improved immensely since then but I wish he would still mix his old vocal style in with the one he has now"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","His new style fits with Beartooth and his old style fit with the self titled. I like the change. "
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Definitely. Attack Attack (S/T) was an amazing album. His vocals kicked ass in Smokahontas."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I agree completely. I liked where be took Attack Attack! after Carlisle left. It might have been cheesy in a sense trying to follow trends and go for a more heavy sound but I loved their Self Titled. Everything after that, including Beartooth, has just been real disappointing in my eyes."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I'm gonna go with Austin Carlile, but unfortunately I have to say Mike Hranica belongs in this discussion as well."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I'm going to see TDWP at the opening date for the Zombie EP tour, but I've never seen them live before. What do you think is ""wrong"" per se with Mike's vocals now? I saw above where someone else said his mids and lows weren't as good, but I also heard they changed the way they recorded his vocals, which impacts the sound on their more recent albums."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","He seems exhausted from the beginning of their set. He sweats profusely just a few songs in and phones it in at times. Obviously I'm not expecting him to scream every line of every song, but sometimes he just seems tired. And his vocals are recorded differently. Not saying I don't like his performances on the records, but his live performances are kind of sad at this point. He just seems so exhausted."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?",":("
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Trust me, it makes me sadder than anything else on this planet because TDWP is my favourite band of all time, but I really don't think Mike's gonna be able to make it much longer in terms of touring on a consistent basis. If he has to limp to the barn to get through tours, I'd rather see TDWP break up. Fortunately, I don't think that's imminent and I still think Mike can make it through tours, but 5 or so years from now...well..."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I hear yah. I'd rather my favorite bands split while I still love them they stay around and turn to shit.

"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Fronz"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","He's still just as good, it's just that he raps more in their new stuff. If you go see them live he still sounds awesome. "
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","It's just I cant deal with him rapping for half the freaking song"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Levi Benton"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","hes still just as good"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Strongly disagree"

"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Compare [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqjp4AEyGxA) from their first album to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8qkNc4k04w) from their most recent album."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Guess you have a point, I hopped in miss may I when I listened to ""hey mister"" so I probably just haven't noticed it."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Not metalcore, but Bendan from Counterparts' vocals are starting to go a bit downhill. He just seems constantly out of breath and tired live now compared to in 2011.

Bit of an unpopular opinion, but Phil Bozeman. His highs on TSD were fucking ruthless, but now they  just sound substantially less angry and aggressive. Don't get me wrong, Phil is still better than 95% of vocalists in the scene, but I'd kill for Phil's screams to sound as good as they did on TSD"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Joel from TAA"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","He sounds the EXACT same as he did in severed ties. Sounds EXACTLY the same live too. Joel still has his touch."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","He sounds so bad live , he's lost his range and it really sounds so bad, don't get me "" let the ocean and chasing ghosts"" are my fav albums but he just lost his touch with his live vocals "

 "
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","[deleted]"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","The popular consensus among A7X fans is that M Shadows' vocals have only gotten better. Sure, he can't scream too well anymore, but that's not a big deal considering they've ditched metalcore a long time ago. And yeah, Matt Heafy's screams aren't as potent as they used to be, but considering how long Trivium has been around, his vocals are still damn good"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Saw them both live at Mayhem and can tell you they both perform incredibly well and their voices actually sound on par to the albums they make."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I completely agree, I saw both at Mayhem last year. What did you think about Trivium's set?"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I thought it looked great. I loved the gigantic banner of the album behind them. The only thing I was disappointed in was the crowd. Trivium tried so fucking hard to hype up the crowd and nobody wanted to get off their butt and enjoy it. Eventually a good chunk of the crowd gave in once they saw what a fantastic performance they gave. they sounded identical if not better (more energetic) tithe album. His voice was dead on."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Every time I see Trivium the whole band is on point. Matt is a great front man, and when I saw them in 2013 was arguably their worst performance I've seen by them, and it was still perfect. You could just tell he was tired. He still hyped everyone up, still conversed with the audience, Matt's a beast. I'm not really into their music, but I will go see them every time they come to town, because I respect the shit out of those guys for working that hard, all the time."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","I'm still pissed as hell about that, a7x had to stop midset because of a storm and then the festival people just told everyone to go home."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","That's so rough!"
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","Matt's cleans have gotten hugely better (at least through Nightmare), and while he can't scream well anymore, he can still scream a little. The worst part, IMO, is that they haven't really had many good songs in a while. To me Nightmare was just meh, and HTTK was a huge step back. Haven't really liked anything from them since the self titled. Nightmare would be good if I had been told its from another band, but from them it seems a little disappointing. They used to be my favorite band but you can't have two sub-par releases and expect to stay there. Doesn't help that my favorite genre moves around quite a bit."
"Which vocalist do you think 'Lost their touch'?","They just need to quit steadily getting softer and softer, and actually play some fucking music. I accidentally let HTTK play a couple of songs the other day, and while I was in the other room I thought I heard soft Metallica. Shame on A7X for letting it get this far."

Every song is fast paced, fun, heavy and filled to the brim with double bass. They've always been really fun to listen to and I'm glad they didn't feel the need to change their sound. "

"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","Back in highschool, this kind of music was all I would listen to but I eventually grew out of it. Lately I've been going through my old itunes and getting back into some of my old songs. I tried listening to the newer bands and even some bands that I once loved and something just feels... off. Miss May I isn't nearly as heavy and Levi sounds like he lost his voice, The Devil Wears Prada is all serious now and he also sounds like he lost his voice, Attack Attack is gone, and Attila just seems like a parody of themselves now. Basically my question is; are there any bands out now that are still making fun, aggressive, and breakdown heavy music? Every song I listen to seems so serious compared to the scene when I was a part of it. "
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","The new fascination with ""seriousness"" is the newest fad, and it's honestly probably a reaction from the nearly cringeworthy era of 2000's metalcore. The best example I have for this has got to be The Devil Wears Prada. How on earth you could go from [this](http://imgur.com/pjZS1rD) to [this](http://imgur.com/SVECSSx)?

However, I digress. All this is to say that, it's kind of hard to find bands that, well, look like they're having fun. I would check out [The Ongoing Concept](http://youtu.be/joYKnDbwUoI?t=1m14s) though, they have pretty upbeat, fun stuff."
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","Well you have to consider that the members in TDWP are growing up and maturing, it makes sense that it would have some effect on their music."
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","Oh yeah, I have nothing against new TDWP, it was just the best example. I was gonna use Avenged Sevenfold, because wow, but they aren't really a part of the scene anymore."
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","Oh boy could I rip a new one into A7X. When I heard Hail to the King, I just stopped. I couldn't. I'm all for bands trying new stuff, one of my favorite albums was their self-titled, but Hail to the King was just so...bleh."
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","Dude I know. I listened to all of Waking the Fallen just earlier today, and I figured I'd give Hail to the King another try. I let out an audible laugh during the Italian chanting on one of those songs. It's just so...awkward. "
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","Well I mean shortly after WtF they said that all their favorite bands weren't nearly as extreme as they were, and then that's why City of Evil happened. And HttK was sort of like City of Evil pt 2, or like CoE with even more classic metal influence."
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","That makes sense, they practically ripped that spoken word intro from one of those songs straight off of Bat Country, but it just doesn't do it for me on the new album. "
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","I feel you, there are some valid complaints about HttK, I still enjoy it however. "
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","I can respect that. I think it's one of their best selling albums so they gotta be doing something right. "
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","Yeah. Although I am kind of yearning for something a little more complex, like CoE was. And the metalcore fan in me secretly hopes for something a little more like WtF, but there's no way that'll happen."
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","I feel you. I guess I'll just sit here and listen to Not Ready To Die over and over again, because that's about as close to metalcore as they'll get now. "

"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","You should definitely try [Oceans Ate Alaska](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdAM8d4RfUk)."
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","First of all, welcome back! How long have you been out? If you like Attack Attack! then I would suggest Caleb Shomo's new band Beartooth. It has a much more mature feel to it, but it's still pretty brutal. One of my favorite bands that's pretty diverse and still going strong is A Day to Remember. Here are some other bands that I would recommend checking out, and my favorite song by them:

- [The Amity Affliciton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu3xGr-lNVI)

- [August Burns Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97T1Zo5-u-o) [Yes it's the full album, just experience it in its entirety]

- [Beartooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=557mc5ICVv8)

- [Born of Osiris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLdlw46Ru9I) [These guys are insane live, and they've become one of my favorite bands after seeing them live at Warped]

- [Capture the Crown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxkjfaV9k8Q) [Not a huge fan of their newer stuff, but their first album was pretty solid]

- [For All Those Sleeping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeU6tx1Nvgs)

- [For Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk_b0VweDx8) [Super heavy stuff. Really big fan of them. Great breakdowns and fantastic vocals]

- [Ice Nine Kills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maguF26AIik)

- [Like Moths to Flames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYRYVlgYMlk)

- [The Plot In You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6Nodj6aDOI) [One of my all-time favorite bands. I don't see them mentioned a lot, but they are seriously worth a listen]

I have a million other bands to throw at you, but I don't want to take up the entire comments and I don't want to keep others from suggesting their own bands. Let me know if you want more."
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","I knew that ABR album would be Constellations before opening it. Great choice."
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","It's really my favorite album, but almost all of their albums need to be heard in one go for the first time. Yes, even the Christmas album."
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","&amp;gt; For Today

&amp;gt; Super heavy stuff

wat"
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","their breakdowns have the power of Christ, obviously can't get heavier than that"
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","all of my kek"
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","Idk Portraits is pretty heavy compared to most metalcore bands. "
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","A day to remember, Architects, Blessthefall, The Amity Affliction are all really good bands with amazing recent stuff, go check them out :)."
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","I agree with you man. Even BMTH isn't as heavy anymore. 

- Try Amity Affliction. Listen to RIP Bon, Open Letter, Chasing Ghosts and Anchors for starters. 

- Blessthefall is still awesome. Beau Bokan picked up the band really well when the old vocalist left the band. Saw them live. Beau Bokan (new vocalist), amazing frontman. I met the band last year. Listen to their new album, Hollow Bodies. Listen to Hollow Bodies and You Wear A Crown But You're No King for starters. 

- Suicide Silence. This varies really. Mitch (old vocalist) died and a new one replaced him. Many think they don't like Eddy (the new vocalist) but I personally like him. He saved the band well, IMO. Listen to You Can't Stop Me, Fuck Everything, Cease To Exit. 

- Upon A Burning Body. THEY ARE AMAZING. Saw them live first at Mayhem and damn they really know how to please the crowd. They have a rendition of Turn Down For What so try that first. As for original songs, try: Scars and Sin City

EDIT: Added UABB"
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","[deleted]"
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","I agree that Eddie is great, but I definitely liked Mitch's vocals better. "
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","&gt; fun, aggressive, and breakdown heavy music

Check out ETID man.  Not as breakdown heavy as other bands, way more mathy but there are a few here and there.  But in terms of fun and aggression look no further.

edit: [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVmlf6koQXA)"
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","Exactly what I would have said, they are catchy, fast and aggressive and some of there breakdowns are just so epic"
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","&gt;Basically my question is; are there any bands out now that are still making fun, aggressive, and breakdown heavy music?

No.

...Thanks for reminding me, asshole. :("
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","Chunk! No, captain chunk! is pretty upbeat. I don't know if they're technically classified as metalcore or post hardcore though. "
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","They remind me a lot of A Day to Remember, and I consider them metalcore."
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","Erra.

Breakdown of Sanity. 

Volumes.

Within the Ruins. 

The Human Abstract. 

Born of Osiris. "
"Trying to get back into the genre, have some questions.","I'm kind of late to the party but you should try some The Paramedic if you haven't heard of them. They are generic as fuck and they are really breakdown heavy and they have some fun angry lyrics, listen to Have A Nice Day and tell me what you think.
And also... Do yourself a favor and stay away from their song Back To The Start.

I would also recommend Fit For A King. Their lyrics are serious but they are heavy as fuck and they have some amazing choruses!"
"New Vol/tures teaser",""
"New Vol/tures teaser","cant FUCKING WAIT"
"New Vol/tures teaser","I hope there's vocals, but if it's instrumental that's perfectly fine with me. As long as it's something being made by Structures, even if it's only half."
"New Vol/tures teaser","i hope its not just Andrew working on it...I want some of the guitar work in there aswell, and some mix of their screams would be DOPE.  All i've seen of it is Andrew with'm though. better than nothing I suppose."
"New Vol/tures teaser","I agree. I'm still super bummed they broke up :("
"New Vol/tures teaser","I saw that Spyros was in California with Nick, but wasn't ever pictured working with Volumes. The Structures Facebook hinted in a comment that Nick might be involved in it. 

It's pretty easy now to share ideas and record while being separated, so I wouldn't rule anyone out. "
"New Vol/tures teaser","thatd be fucking EPIC"
"New Vol/tures teaser","Spencer?"
"New Vol/tures teaser","I meant Spyros (the guitarist), but Spencer is their old bassist. "
"New Vol/tures teaser","I just didn't know the bassists name haha"
"New Vol/tures teaser","It sounds exactly like how I thought it would, &amp; im excited. "
"New Vol/tures teaser","Okay, so I love Volumes and Structures, but I haven't been paying attention to them much. Can someone explain what's going on? I already know about Structures breaking up. "
"New Vol/tures teaser","A long time ago when both bands first toured together, they talked about both bands doing a project together. They kinda hyped it up and even made merch for the project, but never did anything after that...until now!"
"New Vol/tures teaser","I think, back in the day, the two bands toured together and something came up about the two bands collaborating together, whether it was a joke or a rumor. Fast forward a few years, and now they are actually working on a project together..

That could be completely wrong, but I think I'm about 86% positive that that is what is going on.."
"New Vol/tures teaser","So fucking pumped for this. Vol/tures is such a badass collab name."
"New Vol/tures teaser","Am I the only one that finds these riffs groovy as fuck?"
"New Vol/tures teaser","Definitely not "
"New Vol/tures teaser","Perhaps its because I don't listen to either band very much AT ALL, so don't hate me for saying this...but isn't it a bit redundant? This project seems like just another moniker to make the same sounding style of music both bands made before. But then again, maybe I don't know the music as well as some of you. "
"New Vol/tures teaser","Even both bands being as what people say is ""djent,"" they're not too similar. Volumes is a lot more groovier, and Structures are more technical and have more of a hardcore sound. "
"New Vol/tures teaser","Why have I just now heard about this?? Is this like a collab album/EP between Structures and Volumes? Fucking awesome teaser!"
"New Vol/tures teaser","Kinda shitty, not as stoked for it as I thought I was but I'll try to keep an open mind until i hear the full ep/album/song/whatever."
"New Vol/tures teaser","It's 15 seconds..."
"New Vol/tures teaser","And its a pretty lackluster 15 seconds in my opinion"

For me it was Issues self-title and Beartooth's 'Disgusting'. For Issues I thought they were trying to hard to make everything work but then I gave it another chance and now I love it. For Beartooth I don't know why I didn't like it at first but now I've had it on repeat recently.

What about you?"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Surprisingly, and even I don't understand why sometimes, but Architects's latest album took a little bit to grow on me. But when it did it hit me like a fucking truck."

I had never previously listened to them and only checked them out because the album was getting so much attention.

I was new to BMTH at the time an thought Oli Sykes's voice sounded weird, but it really started to grow on me after I gave it a few tries. Specifically ""Can You Feel My Heart"" and ""Shadow Moses"" were what changed my mind. Now it's one of my most favorite albums across all genres.

I guess an honorable, not-necessarily-metalcore, mention was Collide With The Sky by Pierce The Veil. I fucking *hated* Vic Fuentes's whiny voice at first but it somehow grew on me. Probably because I was a whiny teenager myself, but hey, we all were once. Still love PTV though"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Yup, same for me. Couldn't stand Oli's voice for a long time, but I kept listening to Sempiternal because I liked the instrumentals. One day it just connected. Now BMTH is probably my favourite band and Suicide Season is probably my top metalcore album of all time."
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","So many albums, but i'l just list the major stuff.

Converge - Jane Doe

Touche Amore - To the beat of a dead horse

La Dispute - Rooms of the House

Deafheaven - Sunbather"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Sunbather was so much duller than their Demo EP"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","I enjoyed it personally, what did you think of the new single by them?"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","havent heard it yet"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","It is quite nice haha"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","I didn't like Jane Doe before either. Now I think it's a fantastic album and definitely one of my favourites "
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Most people don't like it the first time, its a grower haha "
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Metalcore:

Darkest Hour - Deliver Us

Protest the Hero - Fortress, and Volition

As I Lay Dying - The Powerless Rise

Killswitch Engage - Alive or Just Breathing, and Disarm the Descent 

Atreyu - The Curse

Non Metalcore:

Cryptopsy - None So Vile

Devourment - Butcher the Weak

In Flames - The Jester Race

Thy Art is Murder - Hate



"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Hmm, probably Life Through a Window from Structures. At first I only liked the song Buried but then I started listening to the whole album as background music and it just grew on me."
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","I missed nicks vocals at first but it grew on me"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","I wasn't a huge fan of Every Time I Die the first time I heard them because I thought Keith Buckley was dying on the mic. Ended up easing into Gutter Phenomenon and I loved them.

Wasn't a huge fan of Dance Gavin Dance when I first listened to Downtown Battle Mountain, but then I listened to Acceptance Speech and I was hooked."
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Rise of the Lion by Miss May I"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","That was an album that I wanted to like, but I couldn't. "
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Once I got used to the different screams I ended up getting pretty into it"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Every BMTH and Northlane album."
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Glass Cloud - The Royal Thousand"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","The first time i listened to Hollow Crown by Architects I really wasn't into it, the production was so different to anything I'd heard before and I hated it. Now it's one of my favorite albums though, Early Grave is just so delightfully heavy.

Another one that really grew on me (although it isn't really considered metalcore) is Enter Shikari's A Flash Flood of Colour"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Sempiternal. I didn't like Oli's vocals at first but they just grew on me I guess. That said, in my opinion his vocals on Count Your Blessings can't be topped."
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Oh and pretty much all of BAAO's music."
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Count Your Blessings scared me the first time I heard it years ago... now I scream along to most of the entire album for practice x)"
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Not an album but Rot by Northlane. First time I heard it, I thought it was alright but nowhere near the level of Adrian's Northlane. Then the more I heard it, the more I fell in love. I'm so pumped for Northlane's first album with Marcus."
"Albums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them","Disarm The Descent "

This seems a little harsh. His parts in new OM&amp;M songs are next to non-existent, but saying he has no musical talent whatsoever is harsh. The first two OM&amp;M albums were killer. His screams (when used effectively) are incredible. But their new ""sound"" is not utilizing his vocals. To say he's useless is wrong. I think he's under used. "

"Record labels up north","Hey guys so you all tend to be ones that know where these bands are from and such and im curious if any of you know of some labels that i might enjoy that are up north such as VA, MD, PA, D.C. and areas around there. I'm trying to do some research on a few of these because during my research of my favorite labels such as Victory and Sumerian I've had a falling out with them and their business practices. "
"Record labels up north","Bridge Nine records is from Boston, MA. Also, CI Records is from Lancaster, PA"
"Record labels up north","Upvotes for CI. Several really good bands on their label that could use some more exposure. "
"Record labels up north","I've especially been liking Que Sera"
"Record labels up north","My personal favorite is One Year Later. Love their newest record, they're sick live, and are super nice dudes. Also a big up to Carousel Kings, their new CD is killer too."
"Record labels up north","I didn't really like One Year Later that much, and I haven't gotten around to listening to Carousel Kings yet"
"Record labels up north","Carousel Kings are great. Them and Alive in Standby are sort of leading the charge of the ""TR00 Easycore"" movement, though I highly doubt it's gonna gain as much momentum as Easycore originally did. CNCC are possibly jumping on that bandwagon since they want to be more serious so who knows, it may be a thing."
"Record labels up north","I dunno if CK is leading the movement, but they are definitely a part of it. They only get a few thousand views on their songs on YouTube, which is why I don't see them as being very big yet. I do hope they get there though, though!"
"Record labels up north","Well to be fair, there really aren't that many other bands that come to mind. Who do you think is leading the charge?"
"Record labels up north","To me, if we aren't counting ADTR, Four Year Strong and CnCC. "
"Record labels up north","Ok, FYS I can agree that their latest EP was very ""tr00"", but CNCC (at least not yet) aren't really serious, which is the whole point. They did say they wanted to be serious, but as of right now, I wouldn't call them ""tr00"". Another borderline one I would have said is Me Vs. Hero, but they just broke up so...."
"Record labels up north","Ah, I see, not really my thing though"
"Record labels up north","Awesome thanks."
"Record labels up north","Lol how did you have a falling-out with record labels while researching them? What are you even trying to find out? Labels aren't some secret society or government organization, information about them is readily available. "
"Record labels up north","I used to really like Victory but once I heard about ADTR and apparently some other bands and the legalities I stopped supporting those labels. Sumerian was the same and after all the stuff with Miss Fortune I'm kinda sketched out by them. Looking for studios that id like to try and work for but I prefer to narrow down my job applications to studios that aren't like Victory. "
"Record labels up north","Miss Fortune got dropped because the vocalist got charger with domestic violence, they earned the drop. I work for various labels as a sort of ""contracter"" on tours and at shows and can tell you right now that SO many people want jobs for them and you will be lucky to work for any of them at all, so don't get picky."
"Record labels up north","The charges were dropped though. I, like a lot of others, think the situation was handled poorly. They overreacted before learning the full details of what happened. Plus, you have that whole mess with UABB, so that label seems super sketchy"
"Record labels up north","Thats what im thinking."
"Record labels up north","But he was found innocent. I know I shouldn't but i just dont like how some of them are. "
"Record labels up north","There's a Ska band called Streetlight Manifesto who had similar dealings with Victory and their owner who is generally just not a nice guy."
"Record labels up north","Deathwish Inc. is Jacob Bannon's (Vocalist of Converge) record label based out of Massachusetts I'm fairly certain."

"Of Mice &amp; Men - YDG","Classic"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - YDG","The thing was them was that they were so simple, yet knew when they could punch you in the throat, or let Shaley sweep you away with his voice. The new music is just bland without any dynamics to it. This album actually has well placed breakdowns and riffs, and doesn't rely to heavy on the opening riff/verse/chorus/post-chorus riff or breakdown/second verse/chorus/breakdown/maybe a solo/repeat chorus/maybe end with a breakdown formula that everyone else uses. I don't mind that formula if it has some dynamics to it or if the band is musically talented enough to keep it sounding fresh. But Restoring Force fails at all of that. "

"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","I agree, in Jamie's Elsewhere he was the reason why I fell in love with them. When I hears he was joining OMM I was so excited.

"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","The new style is the complete opposite of why everyone loved them. It's mainly Austin and how he doesn't do the screams how he used to.

"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","Jacky Vincent from Falling In Reverse is so unbelievably talented to be in such a bad band.

Pierce The Veil definitely has some chops, it's just their fanbase is kind of a huge turn off. Plus the lyrics are a little too cheesy for me.

Bring Me The Horizon are ridiculously talented, but like PTV, their fanbase is annoying. Plus they'll never put out anything as good as Suicide Season again.

I can definitely respect Beartooth musically, but Caleb Shomo is such a tool that I can't get past his hammed up vocals and lyrics.

Sworn In has awesome instrumentation as well but oh my god if they release another ""blackness in my head, shoot me fucking dead"" song lyrically, I might actually kill Tyler Dennen."
"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","1. ""they'll never put out anything as good as Suicide Season again"" is the most true statement i will read today. 
2. totally true with PTV too. some of those guys have been acquaintances of mine and they're more talented than the music they play... and the fan base sucks..."
"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","Well this about sums up what I was gonna post. Jacky Vincent could probably bring some insane skill to a metalcore band. "
"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","I was really into Sworn In when I found out about them...till I saw them live. The singer is just on a whole other level of weird, and just an overall underwhelming performance from the band as a whole.

"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","I just searched and read through it. What makes him a tool?"
"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","Because he just has a very phony aura to him. Everything he did in Attack Attack! up until now in Beartooth just seems fake, or non-genuine. Plus there's the AMA fiasco..."
"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","Do you think that he was actually involved in the AMA? I'm I sure what the whole deal with aa is, as I wasn't involved in metalcore yet. I have met him at warped and he seemed nice enough, but the other band members were a lot cooler. The only thing that bugs me about him is how he made the entire disgusting album, I feel like it would've been a lot better if he had the other members with him. Clearly he's talented, but ya know, it could've been a better album. "

"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","I honestly really love their newest CD's instrumentals a -lot- but the songs themselves are just 'okay'. Hopefully i'm not the only one."
"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","they got really weird and artsy on this new one's instrumentation.

"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","Converge. I tried to listen to them a few times, but their music really turns me off.

"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","Johnny Craig is very impressive. He's improving himself daily though. "
"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","Danny Worsnop. He's a douchebag and from what I've heard kinda fucks up his live performances, but damn do I like his voice."
"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","Ronnie Radke is a tool and responsible for some awful music, but when he gets the songwriting right, like ETF's There's No Sympathy For The Dead it's amazing. "
"Any musicians you don't like, but definitely give them credit?","Definitely. The new album looks to be pretty promising too"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","For me it's probably Secrets or Sleeping With Sirens."
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","I'm with OP, Secrets is awesome."
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Miss May I or Blessthefall"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Probably Crown the Empire"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Asking Alexandria/Down &amp; Dirty for sure."
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Can agree with the first album from AA, their second sounded like they got drunk and wrote some songs about a party. Never got into their 3rd."
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","1st is also my favourite, 2nd they literally did get drunk/high before writing it (album is more or less about that) liked the 3rd but nothing stuck with me as hard as the first. I love all songs that danny features in though. Like endless sky by I See Stars, he drops the most egotistical line ever but it gives me chills.

Also I was a fan of his screams in Breathe Carolina - Sellouts."
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Well I mean Breathe Carolina's entire new album was really good IMO"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","I admit I played it a lot. I have a man-crush on Tyler Carter so I loved that collab. They have like 3 subgenres within that album so I can play the whole thing without feeling sick of a particular sound. I like the idea that they have their core sound but then they get stars from other distinct sounds and make each song a unique piece :)"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Favorite song is easily Mistakes.
"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Am going to jam it now! "
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","For All Those Sleeping has some pretty heavy breakdowns in some songs. Other than them, I'd say I See Stars because I also like electronic music a bit and they combine the two perfectly. "
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","I love FATS and I See Stars albums are great 3-d is my personal favorite"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Definitely Miss May I."
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Blessthefall.
At least they're fun and do it well. 
Been jamming Hollow Bodies in my car lately cause that shit bumps.
"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Hollow Bodies is such a great album, sure it's pretty generic in terms of the musical style, but it's so well done"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","""You're just a BITCH!!!"" gets me every fucking time.
UGHHHHHHHH "
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","And it was all a lie!
"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Emmure"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","I agree OP. Secrets is amazing. "
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Does Amity qualify? If so, The Amity Affliction"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Fit For A King, Amity or old Woe, Is Me."
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","I think all of Woe, Is me is good.

Their old stuff highlighted Michael More.

Issues is Tyler's band.

The Woe, is Me with Hance was the best imo.

I kind of just have a man crush on Hance so idk"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","There is nothing ""core"" about SWS. Unless it's ""daddy issues-core"" or ""my bf just broke up with me-core"""
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Someone seems a little salty.
Sure Kellin can sound like a girl, but their first album has a fair bit of screaming. Sorry my opinion isn't like yours."
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Could someone explain what genericore is? I've never been genre savvy. "
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Not a genre. Just poking fun at generic metalcore."
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Ahh, thank you. "
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Any ""metalcore"" band on Rise.😶"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","OM&amp;M"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Fit For a King. I think I discovered them from a thread on this sub that talked about generic-sounding bands."
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Like Moths to Flames for sure"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","blessthefall and old Escape The Fate. Saw BTF with Craig 3 times including the black on black tour. Have seen them with Beau 4 times they are probably one of the best live bands. Old etf with ronnie is probably one of my favorite posthardcore/genricore band. 


I can never not put these 2 together since they both got me into heavy Music. "
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Seeing Escape the Fate and Falling in Reverse together next month :D My nostalgia meter is off the charts :)"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Saw them here in Chicago last year for the Bury The Hatchet tour. They were fucking phenomenal live! Enjoy! "
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Ah excellent! Did they do any collabs by any chance? I'd lose it if they did. Like ronnie come out for the older songs or them do a duet?"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Ronnie, Robert, Jackie, Craig, Max(at the time) came out and did Situations and Not good enough for the truth.

Our line up was

Survive This! 3songs 

Chelsea Grin(One of my favorites)  5 songs 

Escape The Fate 8 Songs 

Falling in Reverse 12 songs 

Then old Etf + Craig 2 songs 

ETF set list was 1 hour

FIR was an hour and a half. 

Seriously it was fucking awesome "
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","OMG I hope they do that again for situations :D Wow i'm very jealous that sounds so good. I'm going to Westfest in NZ and they have:

Judas Priest, Soundgarden, Faith No More, Lamb of God, Fall Out Boy, All Time Low, Antemasque, Papa Roach, The Devil Wears Prada, Fear Factory, Escape The Fate, Falling In Reverse, Mayhem, Lagwagon, Animals As Leaders, Frenzal Rhomb, The Wonder Years, Crown The Empire, 8 Foot Sativa, Kitsch, Killing Yourself For Profit, Depths.

It's 2pm-11pm so I doubt any of the bands will have long sets aye. But fingers crossed!
"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","If you get the change definitely go see AAL that band is fucking amazing live. 

Hope you have a blast! "
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Can anybody explain what genericore is?"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Answered down below, but it's a term for mocking the more generic sounding metalcore bands like Asking Alexandria etc."
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Ah ok i looked it up and was a bit confused because one of the examples used was ""ring Me the Horizon's vocalist Oliver Sykes plays in a genericore band. "" and i dont think bmth are generic at all"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","I don't think bmth is a good example of genericore either. They are the band all the genericore bands copy though :P"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Parkway Drive"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","PARKWAY DRIVE IS SO NOT GENERIC. DOWNVOTED. "
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","The Air I Breathe"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","I don't know if I would consider TAIB generic. They're pretty technical at times "
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","Generic and technical aren't mutually exclusive, Blessthefall is another pretty generic band, but they have some pretty technical parts as well"
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","True, I see what your saying. When I hear generic I automatically think of chug-chug breakdown bands "
"What is your favorite Genericore artist?","They can be a bit technical but as you said only at times. I love ""Great Faith I Fools"" probably one of the most played metalcore albums in my library, but the vocals are layered and over produced, they have tons of breakdowns per song, especially when following the generic breakdown code by playing a breakdown then playing it again in half time, and they also have catchy choruses in most of their songs."

"Ice Nine Kills - ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" [Official w/ lyrics]","I can't get into this album much, and I don't know why. I love their latest record, along with the single that's coming out today. I do however, really like this song. Just not the rest of the record as much. It may be in the production, and that Spencer's voice is just so much better these days than it was, I just can't pinpoint my reasoning.

But this track, man, this track...not as popular as it should be. A metalcore classic. "

"Ice Nine Kills - ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" [Official w/ lyrics]","Its not that I don't like it, its just much more ""average"" to me than The Greatest Story or any track of the Predator Becomes the Prey. Just can't get into the album as a whole like I can with the new one. "
"Ice Nine Kills - ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" [Official w/ lyrics]","S'all good, man. Different strokes for different folks and all that stuff. I prefer The Predator Becomes the Prey as well, I just think some of the vocal harmonies in Safe Is Just a Shadow are mind-blowing. "
"Ice Nine Kills - ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" [Official w/ lyrics]","Im the exact same way. anything before ""The predator EP"" Just doesn't sound good to me for some reason. "

Catching Flames
Clocks

Be stoked!"

"Witnessed and met the guys of Oceans Ate Alaska yesterday and they're really nice in person.","Really like Vultures and Sharks and To Catch a Flame. Wasn't a fan of floorboards

The clean vocals in Vultures and Sharks remind of someone a band and I can't put my finger on it at all, really bugs me"
"Witnessed and met the guys of Oceans Ate Alaska yesterday and they're really nice in person.","Yeah floorboards is very special and a bit too complex BUT if you give it a try it is really nice and after about 20 listenings I really enjoy it. Catchy lines.

"The Amity Affliction - Flowerbomb","Me too, seeing them in Southampton, I just hope they get a decent set length, and the set list isnt the same as what I've seen, as the one they are doing supporting STYG in the US atm is exactly the same as the one from their Headlinerc over here in December, minus Youngbloods :( I would kill for RIP Bon or Life Underground! "

Edit: Whoops, replied to the wrong comment there. Sorry about that. And no I kept getting Esther, but that could be because, well it's 2015 not 1887, and I don't know how to read Morse Code very well."

"August Burns Red - White Washed Live During The Frozen Flames Tour","Try living in Sweden. There are only local, unknown bands playing here. Every awesome band goes touring in the US for 10yrs, then make it an EU-tour where they basicly only plays in Germany, France and UK. If a band actually comes to Sweden, one has to travel across the fucking country to see a 30min show. Nice, thanks, later."

"Who are your favorite bands whose lyrics deal with deeper or philosophical subject matter.","My band will have lyrics like that, but for a proper band I actually think Every Time I Die have some deep lyrics if you look beyond the surface, may just be because I looked too deep into them, like from Parts unknown the lyrics made me think about death and the meaningless of everything, which some of it is true but quite a lot may just be my thought process.

Edit: For post hardcore bands, Touche Amore's Is Survived By was really thought provoking and La Dispute is as always if you get into the lyrics."

"Who are your favorite bands whose lyrics deal with deeper or philosophical subject matter.","Agreed. Though their earlier albums do carry some thought provoking content, it isnt until NJA that it goes overboard. From cynicism (NJA) to nihilism (Ex-L) to an attempt at salvation or atonement (FPU), Keith pretty much takes through a whirlwind of a fucked up psyche, spouting lyrical genius throughout.

"Who are your favorite bands whose lyrics deal with deeper or philosophical subject matter.","Haha I get what you're saying but it isn't always that way. I think that metalcore has the potential to allow the expression of a lot of deeper thinking, but at the moment most of the genre seems to be headed away from that direction.

"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","I feel so filthy after upvoting this..."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","The thing that really surprises me is that now that they have moved so far away from Metalcore, what does Austin do? I mean he barely sings, and radio rock doesn't really call for entire screamed verses, so he's pretty much taking the backseat, even as the most popular person in the band. Even in this song he only pops up during the choruses, and at that his vocals are a part of the background.

Edit: I lied, he screams during the bridge, too. But going from the frontman of a massive band to the guy that screams over a bridge every now and then kind of sucks."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","I absolutely agree. I have been wondering when the time would come where he does nothing. Every one of their singles off Restoring Force puts him on the back burner. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","What? A flair with color? What is this sorcery?"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","If you listen closely in the other songs that were released for this album, he actually does a lot of singing now, he doesnt scream as much(obviously) but hes stepping up and changing vocal styles"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Hopping on that Oli Sikes action I see. Well hey if it keeps him relevant, more power to him. Who am I to criticize when he's making money hand over hand. It's obviously working for him. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","At least BMTHs change was pretty fucking good. OM&amp;M are just fucking horrid now. Aaron sounds like his balls are trying to drop."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","I'd be willing to bet Austin was inspired by Sempiternal (or at least saw its critical and commercial success) and tried to emulate it on RF and this new stuff, but it's nowhere near as good."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Probably. Oli has the natural talent to pull it off is the difference. Not saying Austin isn't talented, but it's clear the band took a hit when Shayley left. I feel like they think they found their identity when all of their fan base feels they lost it."

"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Honestly I kinda chuckled to myself at how for like the first 3 minutes all he did was the ""on you!"" or whatever in the background."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Yeah he sounds like the hype man for a rapper or something."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Ah! But they can't get rid of him either because then they lose the fan girls! "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","You're saying the best course of action is to kick him out of OM&amp;M so that he can reunite the one true Metalcore band - Attack Attack!? The circle would be complete."

"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","I can actually enjoy Of Mice &amp; Men when I accept the fact that they are no longer metalcore. "

"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Holy Breaking Benjamin, Batman!"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","This new sound of theirs makes me so torn.

I loved their first two albums, didn't care for restoring force, and now it's this.

I really like Breaking Benjamin, Red, and Old LP, among others, so I actually like Broken Generation, but considering where the band came from, and the sound they gave up, its disheartening."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","I've had that before, like, I would love the song if it weren't for the fact of the band that made it, and how drastically it changes from the reason I loved the band to begin with. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","I completely agree with you. I grew up on LP, A7X, 3DG, Breaking Benjamin, and Red. Although I don't listen to it much anymore, I still have the appreciation for a good radio rock song. 

I am not, however, a huge fan of old OM&amp;M. Just can't get into it. But based on my old tastes, I have a hard time calling their new songs *terrible* just because they went radio rock. 

Like if this came out in 2009, and I had no prior knowledge of this band, I'd probably jam the shit out of it. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","I don't know if it's because it's a leaked version of the song or what, but it just sounds... bad. Mixing wise."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","The first released song had pretty good mixing. I'm willing to bet the official release will be much better"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Yes, there was another link to a better version that leaked about 2 weeks ago, I'm not sure if it was taken down or not. I can't find it, but it was definitely better production wise than this one."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","As a big fan of the albums that OM&amp;M and Jamie's Elsewhere had released so far, I was really excited about Aaron joining OM&amp;M.

So much wasted potential, such a shame."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","I don't get it. How is Restoring Force and this new stuff so terrible compared to The Flood Reissue songs? There have been literally 0 lineup changes and I was so excited to see where they were headed after they released the reissue songs.

Oh well."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Aaron Pauley wasn't on the The Flood reissue, just Austin"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Even so, Aaron's presence alone wouldn't create this big of a change. I'm just disappointed, I guess."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Agreed. I thought Aaron would have made them *better*. Silly me. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","they left joey sturgis which is the reason the music style changed btw"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","If Joey Sturgis produced (or wrote, idk) Restoring Force/the new songs it/they would have still sucked"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","he wouldn't have written the songs on restoring force/the new songs though, he actually knows how to create music that metalcore fans like."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","call him up and tell him I want zombie ep 2. If he refuses, i'll settle for werewolf ep, alien ep, vampire ep, or bigfoot ep. I *will not* accept loch ness monster ep, because that's just stupid."

"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","So its not that Rise wants another band to run at mainstream rock radio? I don't think its *solely* the fact that OM&amp;M left Sturgis, and a producer change might not have even been their choice. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","they've said that the producer change was their decision, I think they wanted to go a more mainstream radio rock direction and I'm not sure if it was rise's idea or OM&amp;M's."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Hm. Okay. I just find it hard to believe that such a drastic change occurred between the re-issue of the Flood and RF without Rise having some input on the creative direction. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","It's not the line up, it's the style of music. Listen to The Depths then listen to You're not Alone. The difference is night and day."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Right. Which is why I don't get it! In my opinion they were on the right track with songs like The Depths and The Flood and then they just went a completely different direction. It's too bad."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Ooooh, my bad I thought you were saying they haven't really changed. I was about to start throwing punches. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","Yeah I guess my comment kind of sounds like that. I'm dumb haha I definitely think they've changed and I definitely think it's been for the worse! "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Never Giving Up (New Song)","I was excited when I heard ""The Storm"" a few years back because it seemed like a great new direction. This album was disappointing but its not as bad as this sub's putting it out to be. "

"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","
We all know that Of Mice &amp; Men and Bring Me the Horizon (I guess we'll know for sure with with their next album) seem to be changing their sound to be more radio friendly.

Heck, I've even heard Memphis May Fire, We Came As Romans, and Miss May I on a few radio stations.

Do you think this is a good or a bad thing for the metalcore genre as a whole? Why or why not? Do you mind if a band writes one or two songs for radio exposure, but overall sticks to their original sound?

I was thinking about it today and wanted to hear what this subreddit thinks!
"
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","I don't care what bands do with their own sound, but I (and everyone else) fully reserves the right to bash the everliving fuck out of those bands for doing it."
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","seeing you without a tdwp flair is...weird"
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","I'm loving your flair bro, didn't realise you were a fan of them.

And fair enough view!"
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","[deleted]"
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","For me it really doesn't affect what I think of the music, as long as I still think the songs are good. I like new Miss May I stuff, and just because it happens to get played on the radio sometimes doesn't really change my opinion on it. On the other hand, I can't stand new Of Mice &amp; Men, and think it's really boring and generic. I just think some bands are better at pulling off that sound than others. Regardless of whether I like it, it does definitely bring more exposure to the genre, which in a way is good, though often it leads to much more focus on those sorts of bands, rather than the bands I feel are pushing the genre forward, like August Burns Red, Architects, and Northlane. Overall, I think it's a very mixed thing, if done right, it's good music that might also appeal to non-metalcore fans, but if done badly, it's just a cash grab that leads to unnecessary focus on bands that don't really deserve it. "
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","Well said. I don't really have anything to add haha."
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","Honestly, 50/50 here. I think it does support the whole -core genre if there's OM&amp;M, MMF etc on radio stations so people go check them out, maybe even their older stuff. Then they have the ""people that liked this also listen to XY"" kinda stuff on spotify, iTunes etc. so they're probably going to branch out and listen to other kind of heavy music and thus may or may not fully commit to this genre.

Otherwise, it kind of hurts the ""reputation"" of metalcore bands (it's not like metalcore is loved anyways), but as long as the really good, innovative bands (think ABR, Northlane, ERRA etc) don't go full sellout-mode, I don't really care that much since I'll always keep listening to what I like regardless of how it's reputation is or what the fuck people are talking about it."
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","Yeah I agree with what you're saying about more people possibly branching out into heavier music. I think most of the distaste towards it comes from fans that have been there since the beginning and watching them ""sell out"" and start to abandon their original sound, which is understandable.

"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","I've heard ETID on satellite radio on liquidmetal and lithium (if anyone knows those) but they usually play songs like The New Black, or We'rewolf."

"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","I like both of those songs too, but they are some of ETID's more radio friendly songs."

"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","&gt;Do you think this is a good or a bad thing for the metalcore genre as a whole?

Neither. And both. On one hand it brings in new fans, new revenue, and more interest in the genre. On the other hand, labels and bands see that becoming more radio friendly makes more money. So more of them end up doing it. 

&gt; Do you mind if a band writes one or two songs for radio exposure, but overall sticks to their original sound?

I'd rather they don't, but nobody really buys music anymore and I fully support doing whatever you can (as long as you're not just straight up hurting people) to make a profit. So, if that's what a band wants to do. I'd rather them just make what they want to. It'll end up better music that way. Look at Demon Hunter's poppier tracks, they're still pretty good. 

Honestly though. I'm fine with pop music, and bands becoming poppier is fine. Unfortunately it's usually not just poppier, it's also really watered down. Look at As I Lay Dying. Awakened is their poppiest record, but it's their best imo. Or Darkest Hour, their newest was my metalcore AOTY last year and it was super poppy."
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","&gt;One one hand it brings in new fans, new revenue, and more interest in the genre. On the other hand, labels and bands see that becoming more radio friendly make more money.

I think this can be good for labels as well because the money they get from more ""mainstream"" bands can then be used to help bands that are heavier and more technical, but not as appealing to broader ""radio"" audiences. 

&gt; I fully support doing whatever you can (as long as you're not just straight up hurting people) to make a profit.

I think writing one or two songs for the radio isn't a terrible thing, as long as they're good songs. Metalcore in itself isn't just some ""cash grab"", a lot of artists struggle to make ends meet, so writing some softer/rockier sounding songs to help bring in more money/fans can be a good thing.

With OM&amp;M's new song, the song itself isn't a bad song. It's catchy, and honestly I think the verse guitar parts are pretty cool, even if it's not super techy. It's just sort of disappointing that it's coming from a band that established themselves as a great metalcore band in their early days. "

Like Sumerian with AA and stuff like BOO. 

&gt;I think writing one or two songs for the radio isn't a terrible thing, as long as they're good songs.

It honestly depends on the band and quality of the song. The Dillinger Escape Plan has a really poppy, radio friendly track. And it's fucking amazing (the song is [Black Bubblegum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqXVBeEuwLU). 

&gt; Metalcore in itself isn't just some ""cash grab"", a lot of artists struggle to make ends meet, so writing some softer/rockier sounding songs to help bring in more money/fans can be a good thing.

Definitely. The reason I say I'd rather they didn't is purely selfish wanting less songs I don't care for. Because most of the time, those tracks do end up pretty meh. 

&gt;With OM&amp;M's new song, the song itself isn't a bad song.

If it's the broken generation one, I've gotta disagree. I thought it was pretty boring. But it wasn't worse than anything on Restoring Force. I think they could have pulled off something really poppy if they still had Shayley. 

&gt; It's just sort of disappointing that it's coming from a band that established themselves as a great metalcore band in their early days.

I don't care for them as much as I used to, but yeah. Their first album was one of the albums that got me into the genre. 

"
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","&gt;black bubblegum

This I agree with, but at the same time I wouldn't say they are selling out with that song, just a small change in the album adding diversification"
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","Becoming radio friendly =/= selling out. 

"
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","I know that, I was just trying to state that despite this song being catchier/poppier than most of their other stuff it doesn't mean they aren't selling out.

"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","It really depends if the transition is forced ala Of Mice and Men or a natural progression, ala Bring me the Horizon. One is obviously a forced switch in order to get more money, while the other comes off like natural progression, rather than an immediate switch. "
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","I think its bad for the genre on the whole, as I can see that there 'd be  more and more generic bands try to copy this radio friendly sound  and metalcore will get bigger but it'd only be a few bands and then there would be heaps of shitty knock offs. Also I think if there was a lot being played on the radio, metalcore fans would say its a different genre as they wouldn't want to be associated with these new bands and we'd get some new stupid genre.

That being said I think its fine for a band to change up their style if it doesn't for commercialisation, there are plenty of good examples of this , such as Converge , The Dillinger Escape Plan, Every Time I Die, La Dispute and many others have changed their sound plenty over their careers , sometimes for the worse but I still enjoy it as it was done in a creative way instead of trying appeal to the radio.

I apologize now for any spelling or grammar errors as I'm on my phone"
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","[deleted]"
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","It's very much a positive thing in the sense that it brings more exposure to the genre. Sure, may some people not like new WCAR as much as old WCAR? Sure. But if it introduces new people into the genre, and those people branch out, and discover other bands, and the genres as a whole grows bigger, and bands are able to do better financially, then that's great.

Also, I think the whole term ""radio-friendly"" is questionable. Some people use it to mean that the integrity of the music is taken out, simply to make more money, while others use it to refer to the music just becoming more simple, or more ""catchy"", or both. And most people, especially when it comes to heavier music, use it with a negative connotation, but it's not always that black/white

To get back on track a little bit, overall I think it's a good thing. At the end of the day, I would rather have bands like ADTR/WCAR/OM&amp;M become more popular then continue having the radio put out the same shit over and over."
"[Serious] What do you guys think about more bands tweaking their sound to be more radio friendly?","I feel it really depends. When a band tweaks their sound for a more radio friendly fit it's obviously meant to help them get more out there. And I feel that's not a bad thing who doesn't want to be more noticed in the music industry. The problem comes when the tweaks overshadow the band's music style, the best example that comes to mind is Of Mice &amp; Men they've tweaked the sound to the point where I thought most the songs off of RF sounded like a Three Days Grace/Linkin Park wannabe band they're sounding less like themselves and more like a *insert rock band here* on a movie soundtrack. So it's not inherently bad just don't let it take control and of course they should know that it will distance a lot of their original fans."

The Karma is nice, but it is great just to see other people enjoying them and hopefully a few of those people are new listeners.

That description is awesome. Those are both also two influences on them, as well as Squarepusher, Frank Zappa, Aphex Twin, and Converge. Quite wide selection of influence, but I guess that's one reason their stuff sounds so fresh."
"[Mathcore] Car Bomb - Gum Under The Table","You introduced me too them by the way so that's one person and with the tag mathcore I'm sure you got some others too!

I wouldn't have guessed the aphex twins to be honest but they do keep it original.

Was surprised to see Lamb of God. Seeing Atreyu made me nostalgic.

I didn't want to go too obvious with All That Remains or Killswitch, though those are some of my first metalcore bands."
"[Mathcore] Car Bomb - Gum Under The Table","I've never listened to within ruins before, to be honest you may listen to more metalcore than I haha"
"[Mathcore] Car Bomb - Gum Under The Table","To be honest they are more Deathcore, and haha, I don't know. I know of a handful of metalcore bands that I listen to periodically, but not as often anymore as say melodeath or now deathgrindish stuff.

I have accumulated a pretty decent collection though, if I may say so. My brother keeps recommending bands to me, we both do, but he is where I find out about most metalcore or deathcore. Like Within the Ruins, actually. He bought some albums, and then handed me one, and I really liked it hahaha. I keep trying to get him into grindcore, but, aside from a few bands, I don't think he's as into it yet. Some day"
"[Mathcore] Car Bomb - Gum Under The Table","Grindcore takes ages to get into, I only like a few bands and it took me months haha its cool you and your brother share music, I don't really have many friends that like my music my brother hates it haha. I'm generally not too keen on anything death related just growls and those riffs don't do it for me."
"[Mathcore] Car Bomb - Gum Under The Table","Yeah, death metal took me a bit too. I still don't like the cookie monster type growls.

Grindcore for me was one thing that I always said to myself that i'd never listen to. You know, like you say, ""that stuffs just to what I want."" And then I heard Napalm Death and Caninus, and I was like, ""wait, this isn't even that heavy."" But I still don't really like stuff like Pig Destroyer that much.

Recently I got into Cattle Decapitation because of Monolith of Inhumanity. That CD just blew me away. A ""Living, Breathing Piece of Defecating Meat,"" ""Dead Set on Suicide,"" and ""Lifestalker"" I practically listened to on repeat hahaha.

Out of the blue, do you happen to like experimental metal, like not necessarily avant garde, but like funky metal?"
"[Mathcore] Car Bomb - Gum Under The Table","Hmm I'm the opposite with grind I can't touch anything that is more death than hardcore, like what do you think of nails and full of hell? Probably ny two favourite grind. I can't take the vocals of cattle decipation haha


You are going to have link me some man! I haven't heard it before, well I've heard math metal and I enjoy that."
"[Mathcore] Car Bomb - Gum Under The Table","I like that cattle decapitation cd, because it doesn't have the over done growls of their stuff before, and has more shrieks, and interesting cleans.

I like Nails. I haven't heard much Full of Hell, though.

You should check out Maximum the Hormone. They mix funk, punk, pop, doom metal, metalcore, grindcore, and a little bit of Hardcore and Death Metal. They are super fun.

Here's some links:

[Yoshu Fukushu](http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Yoshu+Fukushu/9154720) is their most recent, and tracks like F, Beauty Killoseum, Unbelievable, Benjo Sandal Dance, and the title track are among some of the best on the CD. Also Tsume Tsume Tsume, Alien, and the 2nd+3rd songs, together.

The album Bu-ikikaesu is the one right before Yoshu, and is tied for my favorite. It is hard to find the full album in one place, but some of my favorites from that CD are Zetsubou Billy, Shimi, Akagi, and well, the whole thing is pretty sweet.

Both those albums were so good that I imported them at exorbitant prices just to have the music hahaha. Their music before is good too, but these CDs are pretty much perfect. Zetsubou Billy was one of the songs that got me into them, and it is one of my favorite metal songs. Though it isn't just metal. Make sure you at least check that song out.

And then there is Mr. Bungle. Haha, they aren't always metal, but man, they are all around crazy. The CD California is like Doo-wop, surfer rock, ska-ish, and then some times goes into tribal music or thrash. Some of their other stuff is more like switching between genres, usually with some form of non-extreme metal as the staple. They are weird above all else hahaha.


But, Ninjaspy is pretty cool. Like Reggae-ish ska fused with metalcore or deathcore. Any song is a good bet to get a good taste.


And if Ninjaspy is something you're interested in, or just want more Ska-Metal, The Flaming Tsunamis is like very Hardcore punk version of Ska Punk. A lot of screaming there.

Sorry about the dump, but I wanted to pay you back for the suggestions hahahahaha "
"[Mathcore] Car Bomb - Gum Under The Table","I relistened to cattle decapitation and it was actually not really that heavy or harsh haha just what time does, i was talking to my friend and he described Converge to be the harshest vocals and full of hell the heaviest thing i linked him haha ""dragged through hell"" 

Maxium the Hormone was alright, not my favourite though, Yoshu Fukushu was some of the weirdest stuff ive ever heard... like there was a lot of pop punk in there but then it was super crazy i quite enjoyed it, will listen again and i thought Mr. Bungle was great and it seemed like they influenced system of a down and TDEP quite a bit, don't you think?

I enjoyed ninjaspy and loved The flaming Tsunamis haha

Thanks dude!"
"[Mathcore] Car Bomb - Gum Under The Table","On the Mr. Bungle influence, actually they have a huge influence on tons of bands, including System and I'm pretty sure DEP. Mike Patton has a lot of other bands that are also super influential on everything from Nirvana, to Tool. Crazy how much of an impact he has made.

Maximum the Hormone is just insane. Almost all of the songs are comedic, and it is pretty much just 4 long time friends doing what ever they think is fun at the time. Also, the chick is a damn good drummer, and one time she was drumming so much while pregnant that they had to quit the tour after she was bleeding from it. 

I love Ska-metal, I just wish there was more of it. Skindred has some Reggae metal stuff, but they aren't super heavy, and some of their newer stuff is more like alt-metal, so it isn't as interesting or fun.

No problem!!!

And Converge is awesome!"
"[Mathcore] Car Bomb - Gum Under The Table","You know Mike Patton did vocals on a DEP ep?  I'm at the heart a punk/hardcore kid so I love faster music so that's why the ska stuff was so good haha"
"[Mathcore] Car Bomb - Gum Under The Table","Ska is one of my favorite genres! I grew up with it just as much as metal, so that's been a huge part of my life too. And yes, the Mike Patton stuff with DEP was awesome. When Good Dogs do Bad Things is actually one of my favorites of theirs. The beginning part is so batshit insane, and then the rest is brilliant. Such a good one.

And their cover of Aphex Twin's Come to Daddy is spot on. It was like a huge chunk of my favorite artists all represented in one song hahaha."

"Mosh/circle pit/f...ight dancing...?","So, went to ABR and miss may I show tonight. Both bands did well. Good show.


I am the type of fan who likes to get a little jumpy, a little moshy during shows, especially during heavy songs that have good rhythms, break downs, solos, whatever. 


Well, I realized tonight I have not been to a legit metal core show since parkway drive, at the same venue, almost exactly one year prior. That show was rich with stage diving (and being caught on the other end), circle pitting (as the singer called us out and forced us), and general mashing. All of those elements were clicking hard. Such a masterful show, masterfully hyped up by the band... There was an air of comraderie, mutual respect, and you could tell everyone was satisfied with the active fandom which sometimes manifests upon a metal core concert hall.


Well, tonight there was none of that. 

I've seen MMI four times. Always been a sick pit.

I've seen as I lay dying, TDWP, slayer,megadeath, destroy the runner, lamb of god, bullet for my vspot, in flames, all that remaons, architects, architect, war of ages, bring me the horizon.... And many more. Never have I ever actually felt offended at the state of the pit! Of active fandom, of all the little fucking fight dancers. 


Where the fuck did the courteous pit go? The kind that they are out to have fun. If you getvpushed over someone helps you up immediately. The kind that was not so sparse that the circle pit did not look like a bunch of kids running in a circle. The actual mosh pit, instead of fight dancing, and actively attempting to hurt someone...


It just was not how I liked I guess. Or maybe I'm too old for this shit. I don't want to be. But I also refuse to go without attempting to mosh. I'm just not looking to get punched in the face either.

Fuuuuuuuhhhhhhh "
"Mosh/circle pit/f...ight dancing...?","welcome to the world of metalcore shows in 2015 where to kids go after their karate practice to show off their moves"
"Mosh/circle pit/f...ight dancing...?","It started long before 2015....I was going to Metalcore shows in 2003. People crowd kicking, slam dunking, fighting invisible ninjas, running back and forth punching people on the edges of the pit. I saw people intentionally punch holes in the venue walls, break the moulding off of columns and smash tables and chairs. Way back when. So this is nothing new. 

Ever been to FSU show ten years ago? Hit one of their members in the pit and get assaulted by 5 guys. Walls of Jericho walked off on the second song because someone jumped on stage and punched the singer (a small female) square in the face. Ever see people take their shoes off and use them to slap people in the crowd? Ever see people pour bottles of water all over the floor so no one could mosh because they didn't like the band? Ever seen people standing against the back wall and people are still running back and forth and punching them in the face? "
"Mosh/circle pit/f...ight dancing...?","This is the problem with Code Orange, awesome band but bloody hell their fans are crowd killers like checkout their [This Is Hardcore Set](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv2pZptU3H0). Of the TIHC videos I've seen, their's seemed the most violent by far"
"Mosh/circle pit/f...ight dancing...?","That video was a fucking nightmare to watch"
"Mosh/circle pit/f...ight dancing...?","Awesome band but I agree those fans are terrible... You would get smashed in that pit haha "

"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I'm sure there are some major flaws, but this should allow us to see what is actually the most unpopular opinion than something that everyone agrees with on the sub.
"
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","All That Remains's newest album is actually really fucking good. Ignore what people have said, get rid of any connotations you might have of them selling out, etc. And just listen to this album front to back (on iTunes First Play). There's heavy hitting songs like Tru-Kvlt-Metal and No Knock that get your blood boiling with rage, there's melodic ballads like For You, adrenaline pumping fast songs like Victory Lap. One cannot deny the great musicianship in songs like Bite My Tongue, amazing guitar solo and a beautiful jazz-esque section. The album goes out on a great note with Criticism and Self-Realization, one of my favorites of the album. Heavy, scream-y verses and a beautiful soaring melody in the chorus, with the ominous piano outro that almost lets the album wrap around itself with This Probably Won't End Well (which, while I wasn't a fan of the song at first, it really grew with me and is one of my favorites).

Now that's not to say the album doesn't have his faults cause at times the lyrics can be a bit cringe-y, such as The Greatest Generation. Other times the melodies just don't seem all that right, like on Pernicious (however I really like that song as well).  

Overall, if you ask me, this album takes a third place seat behind For We Are Many (The Fall of Ideals in first obviously). Yeah, their last album sucked, but I think this album takes some of those less popular ""radio-friendly"" ideas and improves them, makes it something actually interesting to listen to. So don't just dismiss this album off of what you heard about the band, and if you have already listened to it, listen to it again. Some of the songs did take me a few listens, but now I really love the album as a whole."

"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","People think Matty Mullins is a douche (since this is the unpopular opinion thread, I guess I'll let it be known that I honestly don't think he is, and yes I know what he said), some people also think MMF is boring (also disagree, but understand why people don't like their music). 

For Today had the anti-gay incident with their previous guitar player, but I don't hold the band accountable for it, especially since Mattie Montgomery apologized and offered a phone number for people who were offended by the statement to call him on. I could however see how people wouldn't want to listen to For Today, they have very few songs that don't deal with Christianity."
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","They're a Christian band, of course. Their lyrics are related heavily to religion, but regardless, if you're going to let lyrics decide whether or not to listen to *good* music, that's just wrong. Music is music, whether or not you agree with the lyrics. I am fan of BMTH's Sepitermal album, and that is heavily associated to atheism. Regardless of my views, I believe a good song/band is a good song/band.

In terms of MMF, I know what Mattie said, and I don't think he's in the wrong for it, personally. He said what he believes, and he didn't state it out right, he just said what he believed."
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I completely agree with you personally, I just meant that I know other people are turned off to For Today because of their lyrics, which I think is as ridiculous as not liking a BMTH song because it is against religion. As a Christian, I think if a BMTH song can change your outlook on your religion, you probably weren't that religious in the first place"
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","Well considering I don't believe in God, it would make sense for me not to listen to a band that only writes music about God. Why is that so strange?"
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","That's not strange, I completely understand. My point is saying that a band is bad purely on their political/religious stance, while not even caring about how good the music actually is. Sure, For Today is an extremely religious band, but their music is actually really good, if you don't mind the lyrics that much. People saying otherwise, BECAUSE of their lyrics, is just absurd."
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I disagree that the music is that good either, all of their songs sound the same."
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I can't tell if sarcasm or serious...."
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","if a metalcore song doesnt have chugs i really have a hard time caring about it.  Its almost like the way i view EDM or trap shit. without a drop its boring...

Its not that i dislike songs without them its just that I LOVE songs with chugs out the ass and theyre clearly the best for live events.

Also. Structures was my favorite band BAR NONE and their albums were flawless."
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I had to upvote for the Structures comment, but I actually agree with the rest. 

I was actually just talking about this with my wife Thurday. I get the a non-stop open chord, dissonant chug song is unappealing to a lot of people, and some cases even myself, but its a necessary part of the genre. I feel like since metalcore is a fusion of harcore and metal, you are going to have things like that. 

There are bands that stick closer to the ""metal"" side of that fusion, and bands that are much closer to ""hardcore"", but you don't really see any bitching about the more ""metal"" stuff, and what you do see is much more casual than the constant ""chugga chugga crap-core"" you see. 

I am all over the map with my tastes, and even in the last year I have branched out a lot to try and listen to stuff I outright hated before, so I don't really understand where its coming from. There's not really any one part of this style of music I 100% can't stand. The trouble is that genres and styles are fluid, styles more than genres. You can split up a lot of what's posted here to different, smaller, more specific genres, but it just seems needlessly tedious. Some stylistic differences are clearly genre changing, like why Carnifex is deathcore, but Born of Osiris is Deathcore/Metalcore.

"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","what makes you think it isn't a metalcore album? what genre do you think it is?"
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I think it's a mix between metalcore and (mostly) post hardcore? Songs like Hospital For Souls, Go To Hell, Seen It All Before for example. And the Deathbeds EP especially, even though that doesn't really count."
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I agree with your original statement, but IMO there is very little post-hardcore on the album. It's metalcore with a lot of softer influences (different rock subgenres, pop, electronic etc.) to the extent that some song aren't metalcore anymore, and some are ""soft metalcore"". But that definitely doesn't equal to post-hardcore as a lot of people seem to think these days. Post-hardcore is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ge6ttcFrvA)."

It would still be metalcore though, post-hardcore can't contain metal/metalcore elements and still be considered post-hardcore. It becomes metalcore when it does."

"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","You know I think you're right for the most part. I just finished giving it another listen. Genre's are annoying because it can be subjective but it really shouldn't matter.

"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I agree with you, I love Count your Blessings-There is a hell, but I'm not the hugest fan of Sempiternal.

&gt;We didn't have any B-sides, but we had a lot of ideas so we put those ideas together and made a couple of songs. They don't fit in with what Sempiternal is. They're actually quite different.

"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","this, TWIO saw the loss of more phc elements for radio rock/generic hooks, not to mention Monte never shredded the way he did in early ETF once Craig joined, nor could he write songs like Ronnie could then.

The musicianship on almost all of etfs stuff post-DIYLF is pretty boring, save for stuff like the Guillotines and the occasional solos to say ""hey, remember we've got one of the best guitarists in the genre, but don't worry we're not even gonna get close to using him to his full potential so that he leaves the band."" 

I mean shit I think Fashionably Late was legitimately one of the worst failed experiments in history, but at least Jacky Vincent got to shred on most of the album."

Christian lyrics are fine just as long as it's not puritanical horse shit like Reformers, and atheist lyrics are fine just as long as it's not wanna be edgy shit (DAE fuk ur faith?)

Same notion applies to political lyrics too. Political lyrics that aren't too self-righteous and condescending CAN be thought-provoking or interesting, but if you're using music as a means to propagate or indoctrinate others, then fuck off. Edgy political lyrics are pretty cringy too (DAE da guverment suking dikks of corporations?

"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I think most bands that get voted for the band of the month aren't that good and I really don't know how certain ones have gotten on there at all, especially before most bands that have actually helped shaped the genre"
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I actually agree with this so much."
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","There are bands that are obviously bullshit in metalcore, but I genuinely think most of the music here that people here dig  (Beartooth, TAA, Sirens and Sailors, BTF, INK, ERRA, WCAR, etc.) is all breakdowns and bullshit. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a lot of those bands and respect their talent as songwriters and musicians, but I don't classify most of this genre as real music anymore.

Don't mean to come across as pretentious because these bands are capable of dynamics and songwriting greater than anything my band will ever come close to accomplishing, but I still think it's bullshit music. Kinda like how I'm never going to feel any emotional connection to the latest and greatest radiorock-core band or pop rock band.

That being said, there are some bands that I absolutely love and respect in this genre as well."
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I don't think Erra deserves to be on that list. Sure they have their fair bit of chugs but their song writing is some of the most innovative in the genre. I don't know how you can't classify them as music. 

As a side note, this inverted upvote/downvote thing is a bit of a mess. Cool idea, but aside from the main comments, I can't tell whether replies are being upvoted or downvoted. Also, are people downvoting things they agree with? lol"
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I think it's funny that you highlighted ERRA out of all the bands I mentioned. I've tried getting into them a few times, but they're the only band on here that I haven't spent a significant amount of time listening to. Maybe I'll have to give them another chance.

Also, I still respect the shit out of these bands and think they're good music. It would be incredibly pretentious of me to try and claim that they're not. The whole ""real music"" argument is definitely a bullshit argument and basically boils down to opinion, but I hope everyone understands what I'm trying to get at when I say it doesn't feel like ""real music"" to me. I remember back in the day when it felt authentic to me, but my taste has changed."
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","So I just want to defend 3 of the bands you listed because idgaf about the others:

[blessthefall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDDn4Kh65MA): Great guitar work and drumming, really no chugging breakdowns.

[Ice Nine Kills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAdAOuJ1fzs): Again, really good guitar work, I like the vocals a lot too. And they're at least doing something different with the theme of the song and how it's set up, not really cookie cutter like most of their peers.

[Erra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTPqWF4rt1E): I just kinda recently got into them, but if you don't like anything else, you have to appreciate their lyrics. They're surprisingly well-written and have a really large vocabulary. The vocals are really strong (even though the cleans are whiny at times), and they're heavy as fuck, but they do have a shit ton of breakdowns, they just do them well."
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","Like I said, I haven't listened to Erra that much, but I do love Ghost Atlas, their singer's side project. I haven't paid attention to their lyricism too much either since I haven't really dug through them. 

Again, I love BTF and INK and I really enjoy the instrumentals, but I find it very hard to connect emotionally or get immersed with artists who's discography is full of chugging breakdowns, violent or absurdly angry lyrics, and that one soft song on every album. It's very fun and interesting to listen to and I will listen through an album like that 50+ times, but it's all bullshit to me haha. A couple years back, I really connected with bands like MMF, TAA, and WCAR, but my tastes have changed a lot since then. "
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","Yeah, I can sort of agree with him to a point, but erra should not be on that list. I can't even rap my head around the idea of someone saying that erra isn't worthy of being ""real music"". They're all fantastic musicians even if there is a fair amount of mindless chugging in their music"
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","On a more serious note, new Of Mice and Men isn't any worse than old Of Mice and Men. Generic scenecore isn't any better than generic radio rock

BVB, Sworn in, and FIR are more talented than most bands posted here

BMTH has had scene fans from the very start. Suicide Season and Count Your Blessings are probably their most scene albums
"
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I have to partially agree with you on FIR. I think overall the songs they make aren't that great, but they were the last band of the day that played at Warped and damn those guitar solos were incredible. "
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","People love to talk shit on bands like FIR or BVB but if you actually take the time to listen to them, they actually sometimes have a fair amount of musical talent.

Edit: I think all three bands have their fair share of cringy lyrics, but I still think overall BVB are better lyricists than ADTR"
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I would say generic scenecore is more enjoyable/entertaining than radio rock (in general), especially from a musician's perspective. Would you rather listen to Of Mice &amp; Men/Asking Alexandria/BMTH etc on repeat or something like Theory of a Dead Man/Nickelback/Three Days Grace?"
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","They're both equally bad imo. If we're talking about this from a musician's perspective, there's nothing a genericore guitarist could do that a radio rock guitarist couldn't do"
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","Guitarist, maybe (I've played for 4 years and there's some generic scene core I have trouble playing fast enough for) but drums surely not. I've played the drums for 11 years, and it takes 10x more skill to play any scenecore/hardcore in general drums than any rock song ever, between double bass, off beats, mathcore shit and blast beats, etc etc. That's actually why I even got into core in the first place, cause I like to play along to what I listen to, and I was entirely bored with mainstream/rock music outside of stuff like A7X, Breaking Benjamin, ATR, etc. so I searched for something more stimulating. I've gotten into several arguments with guitarists about the complexity of songs, all unable to see things from a drummer's perspective lol. Even non-musicians who just don't get it."
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I'm a self taught drummer and I play guitar (both for about 4 years) and the majority of genericore is easy on both. You said scenecore/hardcore, but you can't really lump them both together. The hardest thing about genicore like Asking Alexandria or Of Mice and Men on drums is just getting the coordination to play the kick patterns, which anyone can get down with a year of practice. I've never heard blast beats or complicated time signatures in a genericore song in my life. This is why you can't lump scenecore and hardcore together; actual hardcore is chock-full of fast blast beats, complicated kick patterns, and unorthodox time signatures. Scenecore has none of this on drums.

Even if we're talking about guitar, stuff like A7X and Breaking Benjamin is ridiculously more stimulating than genericore, which basically consists of chugging an open chord, maybe playing an alternate picking riff, then going into a chorus which only consists of four powerchords. A7X has plenty of tricky leads and solos that the average genicore guitarist probably can't play

I think we're on the same page for the most part, but your definition of generic scenecore seems to be a bit different"
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","I think you misunderstood, A7X and Breaking Benjamin were my examples of non generic mainstream music I still listened to when j got into hardcore music, which 'scenecore' is a subgenre of. 

I don't know of you've ever listened Miss May I's early stuff, but its pretty stereotypical scenecore and has plenty of both math beats and blast beats. Most scenecore has off beats actually, Of Mice &amp; Men's first album has a lot of it. Scenecore is very erratic musically in order to sound more complex than it really is. 

I could already play any A7X song when I got into core and I was still blown away by stuff that generic metalcore drummers could do. Regardless of talent or innovation, that extra year you mentioned developing the skill it takes to do even basic scenecore double bass is longer than it would take to learn some generic butt rock song for even a beginner. "
"An unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.","My bad, I did misunderstand what you said about A7X and Breaking Benjamin. Not sure if I would call metalcore a subgenre of hardcore, more of just a crossover of metal and hardcore punk. But at this point I'm probably just splitting hairs haha

I've never listened to MMI barring a few songs, so I've never really heard generic metalcore with anything too complicated on drums

But if we're talking about guitar, my point still stands: Anyone with a year of experience can chug an open chord and then play some powerchords

"What is an honest criticism that you can say about your favorite musician or band? (x-post /r/music)","All I'm asking is for Jesse to use more complex words, but listening to and analyzing their vocal style has made me come to the conclusion that they can't. These words are way too hard to sing and have too many syllables. If you take for instance lyrics from some Impulse songs you'll notice Jesse doesn't sing longer words (mostly); only Garrison does. I guess that's why it'll be difficult for him to alone write for a vocalist whose style is so different."

1.  I think Shayley sounded better in Of Mice &amp; Men, and I think if he would of stayed they wouldn't of sold out like they did in RF.  Still love Dayshell tho.

2.  This one is a little broad.  I don't like solo albums.  I'm looking at you, MMF and Issues.  I love the bands, but stick to your niche.  You're not suddenly going to transition from metalcore to being the next Drake, and honestly I think it wastes the band's time and resources, even if it's not meant to.

3.  This is prbly closest to the topic at hand.  Asking Alexandria was my favorite band ever.  Stand up and Scream was/is actually one of the greatest albums I've ever heard.  Reckless &amp; Relentless was also a fantastic sophomore album.  But goddamnit did they drop the ball on FDTD.  It just wasn't AA anymore, and it was actually heartbreaking.

"What is an honest criticism that you can say about your favorite musician or band? (x-post /r/music)","He's a fantastic vocalist, same with Mullins.  I guess my issue is that they're still actively with their band when they put these albums out, and I just feel like it takes their focus away from what made them known in the first place.  Kinda like they're just using the band as a stepping stone, and wouldn't give a second thought about leaving the band if their solo album blew up.  I could be wrong, but it's why I just don't like the feel of solo albums."
"What is an honest criticism that you can say about your favorite musician or band? (x-post /r/music)","I guess, but I'm almost positive that Tyler did it because he wanted to. He loves that kind of music and is evidently really good at it too. Also, it's been in the works for literally 3 years."

"What is an honest criticism that you can say about your favorite musician or band? (x-post /r/music)","Haha yeah it's been talked about for more like 5"
"What is an honest criticism that you can say about your favorite musician or band? (x-post /r/music)","I like your perspective on solo albums. The counterargument would be that it allows for musicians to express another side of their music that they want to release. Their motivation could be extrinsic (if they wanted to become the next pop sensation and make tons of money) or truly intrinsic (they wanted to experiment with a sound outside of the scope of their music).

In general, side projects can be awesome because musicians can write and perform with other musicians to enhance their sound and creativity. However, the conflicts with this is that it has the potential to impede the original band's progress and it can homogenize their playing styles instead of enhancing it. However, some musicians don't care if the sound is similar to other bands/genres/material--they just want to jam and have fun with some other people.

I do believe it is selfish for one member to have a side project going while in an active project like you said. It is awesome that they are devoted and love music enough to take both on, but if you are limiting the potential of you and your bandmates, that is bad.

An example of a side project done well would be Sons Of The Sea by Brandon Boyd of Incubus. He named it Sons Of The Sea because he didn't want people to attach his name to it and it was strictly for artistic expression. The songs were top notch, did not interfere with his band's schedule, and he gained a lot of knowledge about musicianship, songwriting, and production that will undoubtably transfer over to Incubus.

Then there's Matty Mullins--personally, I believe it was a cash grab. Also, that snare drum tone combined with the uninspired lyrics and songwriting was absolutely painful for me. But hey, some people dig it and Matty seemed to enjoy it, so I don't mind."

"All That Remains Premieres 'Tru-Kvlt-Metal,' Talks P-ssing People Off","Honestly, I can't say I *don't* like this. Granted, it's not as good as their older shit, but that's kind of the point he's making.  
I've actually been listening to the other singles too and it's really not as bad as most people make it out to be. I don't get how a lot of this subreddit can dig things like Wovenwar, whose change in sound from AILD I'd compare most closely with ATR's change in sound, but then turn their nose up at stuff like this. If ATR came out as a new band playing this kind of music they wouldn't receive even half the hate they are getting.  
And so maybe it's a little more radio friendly... I'd take this playing on the radio over anything off of Restoring Force, another album that gets shit on for being radio friendly."
"All That Remains Premieres 'Tru-Kvlt-Metal,' Talks P-ssing People Off","&gt; If ATR came out as a new band playing this kind of music they wouldn't receive even half the hate they are getting.

True, ATR still has some good songs. They're just bad by comparison to their previous work. The Fall of Ideals is just such an amazing album. And in comparison to that, everything they've come up with these last 3 albums (especially the last 2) sounds incredibly boring and mediocre at best.

But the most frustrating thing is probably their entire attitude about it. They've completely sold out. ""You want us to sound more like TFOI again? Yeah, fuck that. We're not going to do that. Instead, we're just going to make this album even more uninspired mainstream radio rock than the last one because $$$."""

"The Amity Affliction - ""F.M.L.""","Not trying to be rude so don't take it that way. 
Can someone explain to me why they like this band? I just don't get it and would like someone else's perspective. "
"The Amity Affliction - ""F.M.L.""","I first saw amity affliction at warped 2013, they put on an awesome stage prescence and were incredibly friendly and talkative with the crowd. They have a great clean vocalist, their screamed vocals might be a bit weak in some other bands with different sounds, but their songwriting works to maximize what joel birch can do with his voice, which excels in the right environment. lyrically, they have lots of hopecore lyrics, but the delivery of them seems so much more sincere and personal than other bands (the song Pittsburgh was about a very serious near death experience for birch), plus they don't really advertise it despite being a major facet of their music. Also the group chorus on Pittsburgh gives me chills every time. if I were to sum it uo though, I would say their greatest strength is that they are able to skillfully pull off a lot of elements in their songs that might sound generic or insincere in other bands but they have an x factor that makes them so great"
"The Amity Affliction - ""F.M.L.""","Well said."
"The Amity Affliction - ""F.M.L.""","Thanks for replying. I saw them on the first stop of the disobedient tour in sac. I actually did not like the cleans at all while the tight the screams were okay. What bugs me more than anything is that nothing stood out for me. "
"The Amity Affliction - ""F.M.L.""","I started liking them just before Warped Tour ~~2012~~ 2013 and fell in love with the clean vocals and how catchy they were. The screams are really powerful without being growls. I was worried their live performance wouldn't be good just because of how high his cleans are. To my surprise they were spot on live. They were way better than I expected, and they were so happy on stage and so appreciative of everyone being there. They really surprised me live with how good they were. Some of their music might be a little generic, but overall they're catchy and enjoyable to listen to, and their live show is awesome.

Edit - it was actually 2013 Warped Tour, they start to blend a little after going 5 years in a row "
"The Amity Affliction - ""F.M.L.""","Joel Birch doesn't so much scream as he does shriek and wail. But that's what gives him his own sound, and it's rad as fuck!"

"The Amity Affliction - ""F.M.L.""","Their styles changed drastically over the years idk what you complaining about lol sour as fuck"
"The Amity Affliction - ""F.M.L.""","what? majority of their songs are so generic and follow something like my life sucks, metaphor about an ocean, I'm either okay/not okay. It hasnt changed at all. I dont like it but they have a targeted fan base which is edgy and tumblr teir teens but it works for them I guess."
"The Amity Affliction - ""F.M.L.""","I think unlike most ""helpcore"" bands, Amity's messages are sincere and real, and not an attempt at targeting a specific demographic. "
"The Amity Affliction - ""F.M.L.""","Obviously music is a very subjective form of expression and it's why I'm not saying don't listen to these guys but for me personally I went through a metalcore only phase but I've grown up and expanded my musical interests. Metalcore still remains to be one of them but for me personally I'm very picky when it comes to metalcore and bands like amity because I don't think they offer anything to a stagnating genre but I know why people would like the genericness of it because I was once like that. I just don't think they're that great, that's just my opinion and my musical inclination but when a band does the same thing for the same audiance it gets old."

"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I really hate how some people go out of their way to completely trash a band they don't like. Some bands cater to a certain audience and if you don't like it, don't listen and move on. It's really annoying. I really love that most bands support each other or have some sort of friendship. I see bandmembers interact with each other on Twitter all the time and it's a great sight. It's like they're a united community wishing one another the best. It's great. Oh, yeah and I really fucking like breakdowns."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","This this this this!!!! I absolutely despise that some bands get constantly bashed on."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I feel you. Every comment section on YouTube is a cesspool of hate comments that contribute absolutely nothing."

"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I wish I would have understood this a couple years back. Me and my buddies are in your average local rock band and we would play with lots of bands we did not enjoy listening to. We used to sit back and shit talk the entire show and then play our set and think that everyone was probably shit talking us while we were playing.

Now, even if I'm not a fan of a band's sound or see that they are a bit choppy, I respect that they are out working hard to make it happen. Plus, my band still messes up all the time--I go off time occasionally as a drummer, so who am I to judge? I also know that everyone has to start somewhere and that they'll get better with each show and do their thing. Also, who gives a shit if I don't like their sound? More often than not, those guys are some cool ass people that I love hanging out with after their set."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I think it has to do with the fact we were all young. It seems ""cool"" to pick on something you don't like. Makes you feel superior, but after a while I think you should grow out of it and let others enjoy their opinion."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I really don't like how many bands are just copying off each other without having any originality.

"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","Your positive statement is kinda why I lean more towards deathcore now, a lot of bands are willing to try more diverse sounds and there aren't that many ''generic'' bands"
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I'm just not really much of a deathcore fan other than Born of Osiris, so I've been leaning towards the more interesting metalcore, bands like August Burns Red, Northlane, Erra, Architects, etc..."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","well I'm assuming you've checked them out, but if not, you should give Veil of Maya a listen to, specifically their albums The Common Mans Collapse, id, and Eclipse"
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I've listened to them a bit, not a huge fan, but some of their stuff is sort of interesting"

"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I've hated the homogeneous and overall generic sound that so many bands have had for such a long time, but it seems like experimentation and true progress is finally being made.

So, that makes me optimistic about the future."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","One thing that I have loved seeing in the local scene is that there are bands who are playing some of the most abstract and creative things. Yes, there are your cookie cutter bands and some bands do things that are just absurd, but there are bands that hit that in between point and just kill it.

For example, I saw [Wolfshark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jHgdfdRYtQ) last night and they were absolutely amazing. Great stage performance, each member is phenomenal at their instrument, their vocalist kills it, and the songwriting is something fresh. I can't even describe how good their drummer is.

Anyways, call me crazy, but I wouldn't be surprised if every local scene has bands like this. It's really cool."

"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","How do you feel about TAA? They do make   a lot of songs on those topics but outside of their music I don't feel like they thrive on that image. They just seem to party and have fun"
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I don't really like them that much because their music never really clicked with me, but they seem genuine. With what I know about the circumstances of their band forming, it's kind of hard to not write about those kinds of topics. They don't seem to be doing it as a gimmick."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","Coupled with that, I think Joel has suffered a lot in the past from depression, so I guess to him writing song about it is both therapeutic, and can also help explain/console listeners that might be suffering from similar problems."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I think he has talked about this publicly, and how his past experiences influence his music. So I don't really consider them ""hopecore""."

"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","What about bands that write some of their music about suicide and depression, but *aren't* trying to commercialize/profit from it specifically; it's just part of their music.

Like Moths To Flames comes to mind. Like, their vocalist Chris *actually* suffers from depression. Can he still take inspiration from it, even though they're metalcore? I'd say so."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","Yes, those bands are fine. I'm specifically talking about your Of Mice &amp; Mens, The Colar Morales, etc. that have made the ""have hope, you're not alone"" thing a literal gimmick just for them to make money."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","Absolutely agree. For me, that shit got old with MMF's third album."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","Apparently not, since people shit on The Color Morale even though Garret Rapp has clinical depression. "
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","Hate: Fucking Hopecore. I blame OM&amp;M and TCM for this.

Love: Concept albums. There are a lot of bands who have worked these great stories into their albums (*Council of the Dead*, *Zombie EP*, the ""Johnny Saga"" by CTE, and *The Emptiness* to name a few) and I hope that bands keep going with this. It takes a huge amount of skill to pull it off, and it really turns good albums into great albums."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","Tcm really bothers me because Know Hope seemed incredibly honest. Then every other band started doing it. Then they came out with HOPE or whatever....are you kidding me. "
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","When you literally say ""I am your savior"" in your song, you may be TCM"
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","Hate bands that write material that they can't pull off live.

Love bands that can pull off their material live."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I think it's one thing to ""pull it off"" live, and another to not be able to passably perform it. I can think of plenty of bands who are good and entertaining live, but not great. They just kind of ""pull it off"", rather than take it to the next level. I think that's ok, if your music is complicated as fuck in the studio. "
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I agree, but at the very least a band should be able to play/sing their material live. If they can go above and beyond that then that is awesome but its just embarrassing watching some bands play live."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","That's why The Bravery is so great. Sam admits he's not a very talented singer, but he makes his voice work perfectly for their music, and really gives it his all live."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I feel like this with The Color Morale. Garret is absolutely abysmal live. It's actually painful to see. I was really disappointed since I was a big fan back then."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I truly hate unnecessary clean vocals. I'm all for bands doing their own thing and what not, but a lot of metalcore bands I find will often get me pumped up, loving it, everything's getting heavy and what not, then bam clean vocals, most often then not pretty high pitched or pop-esque. Some bands, it fits. But for some, it totally ruins the flow for me, and it seems like they're added only to be be less edgy so more people will listen to them. 

I LOVE concept albums, like someone said earlier. I remember hearing Zombie EP when it was first released like 24/7. I still listen to it all the time. Concept albums are fun as shit to listen to when done right. I pray for the day TDWP releases a Zombie LP or some other off the wall concept album.
"
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","For me, I love clean vocals but what seperates a good artist from an average one is being able to transition into the cleans but keeping up the intensity.

I hate when bands have this really epic intro and then they stop playing for like 3 seconds and go into cleans that don't really fit the last segment of the song"
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I know exactly what you mean. It's a total let down. "
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I don't get why cleans have to got to be whiney/nasally as fuck. You could be mistaken that it's just one guy doing the cleans for all metalcore bands, because apart from a few, they all sound the exact same. The only band I can think of where they sound different is Every Time I Die, but I imagine that's because they don't use cleans as a 'backup' vocals, Keith's vocals are always at the forefront."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","I hate how anti-old school metal the average metalcore listener is. Sure I like metalcore but I also love metallica and slayer.

I love the combination of heavy and clean vocals"
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","For me at least, I love hardcore punk. Which is the genre Metalcore is a derivative of. The ""metal"" part of ""metalcore"" is shorthand for the full name of the genre, which is ""metallic hardcore"". Metalcore isn't truly for metal fans, it's for hardcore fans looking for a little bit of metal thrown in. "
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","This x1000. 

I don't specifically care for hardcore ""punk"" - I dig more traditional hardcore."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","Hate: When people that don't listen to this genre immediately classify Hardcore/Metalcore as ""Satanic"" or ""Encourages to you kill others &amp; yourself"".

Love: The limitless experimentations that can be done with this genre and how the addition of diferent genres like EDM/RnB somehow works. "
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","My friends who don't listen to it always call it ""that hate your parents music"""
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","If I could take away one thing from this genre it would be the money, it's driving bands to cater to the biggest subsection of the population possible. Obviously I want want bands to earn what they deserve, I just don't want it to motivate them to create something that isn't genuine. Currently the genre seems like such a barren wasteland to me. Sure, there are bright spots such as Erra/Periphery/Northlane but you reeeeeally have to dig to find talent nowadays. Post MySpace metalcore has primarily been generic, and bands who pushed the envelope years ago are releasing disappointing albums compared to what they are capable of (I'm looking at you TWA). I just want compelling albums and not a 12 track plea for my money via super edgy breakdowns and cringe including lyrics. "
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","Shitty electronic intro/interlude/outro tracks. I can see why they are used but the majority are boring as hell and take up 2/3 tracks of an 11 track album, which is pretty annoying I think."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","Change: whiney clean vocals
Keep: breakdowns. Oh my god the breakdowns."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","If you asked me this a year, or even like 6 months ago, I would have said something like electronica bits, or rapped parts. But now, I kinda see the value in everything. Sometimes there'll be a rap section that turns me off, or an electronica breakdown that I think is dumb, but I 100% want people to keep doing whatever they want. I like variety in my metalcore.

And I see a lot of people saying they dislike the clean vocals, especially if they're whiny. I say, fuck that, I love the pussy ass clean singing. I prefer when bands have it actually. "
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","Fat chicks stage diving."
"What's something about this genre/scene you truly hate and want to disappear? What's something you love about it that you wish never goes away?","What I hate: The overuse  of breakdowns. The presence of breakdowns themselves are fine, but we don't need one in every song. Much less two or three in the same song. Especially when they're needlessly long. Listen to [Blue 42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0hePNdg4NM) by Haste the Day for an idea of what I'm talking about. The breakdown takes up nearly half the song. Otherwise it's a great song. Now compare it to [An Honest Confession](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1xpARRtNKk) from the same album, still a little heavy on the breakdown but it's used much better. Or [The Bloodening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8WSoKzhVfY) which is abouta s close as I can think of to being perfectly balanced.

This song:

Pretty sure he's talking about his struggle with Cocaine/God 

Edit: not heroin lol"

"Upon this Dawning-Embrace the Evil",""
"Upon this Dawning-Embrace the Evil","Who cares about image? Is the song good or not, that's what matters. And this band is criminally underrated IMO. The chorus of this song gives me goosebumps. "
"Upon this Dawning-Embrace the Evil","whats their image?

oh and I agree, really nice song, genius chorus. "
"Upon this Dawning-Embrace the Evil","I don't think anyone was saying anything about their image, unless I missed something lol.

But I love UTD.  They are incredibly underrated and they deserve way more fans.  They also seem like super laid back dudes."
"Upon this Dawning-Embrace the Evil","I hated their old shit. This new album was awesome though I really like the new screamer "
"Upon this Dawning-Embrace the Evil","I definitely agree. This album reminds me of Betraying The Martyrs kinda "
"Upon this Dawning-Embrace the Evil","Amazing song :) Don't really like their image but amazing song!"
"Upon this Dawning-Embrace the Evil","Image?  Care to elaborate a bit on that."

That's not a good thing."

"Architects - Broken Cross",""
"Architects - Broken Cross","I'm a Christian and I actually like this song. 

I personally thinks it calls out Christians, which is something that needs to happen, because Christians today have a lot of things backwards. 

I personally think the song is a reminder that Christians need to love others, because they're who are supposed to show God's love. Obviously the vocalist does not feel God's love. That's a failure of Christians everywhere.

The song convicts me. 

It also sounds fucking awesome. These guys are great live. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","Seems more like a rejection of God than calling out christians. As in even if God is real, he's still not a loving being, with all the suffering in the world and whatnot. Humans are fucked up, and the lyrics tell that God basically feels like we are a mistake and regrets creating us.

(Not trying to ruin the song for you though. Bleh on, brother.)"
"Architects - Broken Cross","That's the beauty of music though. It can mean different things to different people.  "
"Architects - Broken Cross","That's just art/media in general. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","Sure, I just went with music since that's the medium we're discussing. It fits."
"Architects - Broken Cross","Nah man, I understand songs mean different things to different people. You're right about humans being fucked up. A lot of the suffering in the world could be solved if Christians actually loved people though. Not all of them, of course. But yeah! Cheers! "
"Architects - Broken Cross","I agree, it seems like it's more of a fundamental disagreement with Christianity rather than a disagreement with the actions of the church. BMTH's music usually seems like more of a ""Christians are hypocrites"" tone, and I feel like Architects are more of a ""I don't understand how suffering/hate exist under a Christian God"" tone. The first line of the song is kinda what gives it away for me, ""God only knows why we were born to burn....."" 

I don't agree with the content of the song, but it's definitely a viewpoint I can understand. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","Christianity's story (along with many other religions) start with the creation of humans with the hope that they would thrive, not ""burn"". It's human nature that caused humanity to fall, not a predetermined fate that we would fuck up. 
In Christian viewpoints, God created people to be perfectly happy in the Garden of Eden , and just because the God is all-powerful doesn't require him to intervene. He may seem like a mean god, but the bible says people screwed up, not God."
"Architects - Broken Cross","I understand that, but I think the song is trying to make the point that a God who's merciful wouldn't allow those things to happen. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","Agreed, and I love the song. I can't disagree with the song's message, and even Silent Planet's new album is all about the same thing. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and I like songs like this that challenge people to question their beliefs."
"Architects - Broken Cross","Yeah for sure"
"Architects - Broken Cross","If you were a father who told his kids to do anything they wanted except for one thing, and that the consequences of the one thing would be horrible, and they did it anyway, would you let them suffer the consequence of their action, or go back on your word and give them a less severe punishment (Or no punishment at all)? "
"Architects - Broken Cross","Okay, I'll use your same example here. Let's say you had a son who did something absolutely terrible, I mean just abhorrent, that landed himself a life sentence in prison. Would you want him to be in prison? 

Even more important than that, let's say his wife was pregnant with your grandson. Would you send your grandson to live a life sentence in prison too? I mean, his father really screwed up, won't he be the same? Wouldn't it be best to just lock him up before he has a chance to really do something bad? 

From what I hear, that's really the point of the song. How could God do something like that to me if I was never given the chance? It seems like a fundamental disagreement with Christianity. Again, I don't agree with the viewpoint of the song, but I can understand the line of thought. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","Now the North Korean penalty system all makes sense. Kim Jong-un is literally God."
"Architects - Broken Cross","Irrefutable evidence. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","But also, Christianity doesn't say that God causes suffering. According to the Bible, only man causes suffering. God doesn't fix everyone's problems because he wants people to live with their faults and see that they need him to rescue them. 

If everyone were perfect and never had a problem, there would be no need for God. I'm a Christian because I see that I am a fundamentally flawed creature who needs something greater than myself to rescue me from this life that I've already screwed up pretty badly. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","How did you screwed up pretty badly?"
"Architects - Broken Cross","I've lied to people, I've stolen from people, I've done thing that I regret, I've been horrible to people, etc. Plenty of things that I've done wrong. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","Would I want him to be in prison? No. Would I let him out? No. He needs to understand the consequence of his actions. I wouldn't put the child in prison, but he also needs to see the consequence of his father's actions, so that he can learn from it. Instead of being in prison himself, he has to live with his dad being in prison, so likely not growing up with him, being basically constantly separated from him, never really knowing his father. To me, that would be worse than prison. Then he would be messed up because he didn't grow up with a father. Then his kid would be messed up because he didn't know how to be a father since he never had one. Then his kid would be messed up because his dad's dad didn't know how to be a father, so his dad didn't either, and now neither does he. 

So on and so forth. One action introduces the problem for many generations. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","I actually had this come on my shuffle today and thought the same thing.  I'm Christian too and when I hear, ""Hate must weigh on you like a broken cross"" I think of the ""Fire and brimstone"" version of Christians and how they need to reform and be accepting of folks from all walks of life. Christianity is about love, not about being better than anyone else. Cheers!"
"Architects - Broken Cross","Was going to say the same thing. I'm a Christian and I love this song. I don't arrive at the same answers but I resonate with the questions raised by the song. The existence of evil can be difficult to square with the existence of a loving God. If you're going to repudiate and reject God this is kind of the best music to use: Brutal, but beautifully sad too. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","Yeah, I'd agree man. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","I love this song as an atheist because it reminds me that hate is actually what I'm supposed to be against. I'll admit sometimes I get very bitter about the subject of religion but this song makes me understand that you can't fight fire with fire. 

Hate is the line that we should all strive not to step across. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","Agreed. 

Sorry about whatever made/makes you bitter toward religion. Hope it is remedied soon! "
"Architects - Broken Cross","There's always something very bad happening ""because"" of religion, so very unlikely."
"Architects - Broken Cross","Yeah that's true. If everyone could just get along. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","I will never not upvote this song. Absolutely brilliant."
"Architects - Broken Cross","Archiblehcts"
"Architects - Broken Cross","I saw Architects on tour with Stray from the Path as main support. There were never more Blehs said in one night."
"Architects - Broken Cross","They are so good. Listening to The Distant Blue album right now. God a chance to them live back in November and it was one show I will never forget!"
"Architects - Broken Cross","This band is so incredible. They were fantastic live! I was so blown away by their performance. This album is definitely the best album of 2014 IMO. I can't get enough.

"Architects - Broken Cross","Haven't seen the nsfc tag until now. Amazing! "
"Architects - Broken Cross","It gets used on pretty much every BMTH song"
"Architects - Broken Cross","Haha, no shock. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","Whaaaat? Even on Chelsea Smile? Pretty sure that has a religious influence to it. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","I might be weird for this, but as a Christian who doesn't listen to certain bands based on their message/language, the tag is actually really useful to me. I hope it gets used more frequently where appropriate.

Disclaimer: I still respect bands with a message like that of this song, and I think there's a place for it. I think there is something valuable that everyone can learn from it. I just prefer not to listen to it myself. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","Different strokes, not a big deal. Used to be Christian as a young lass. However I would listen to literally everything. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","I still am a Christian and listen to everything. If a song is going to somehow cause you to ditch your faith, there are bigger problems in your life than that song..."
"Architects - Broken Cross","So while acknowledging that there is something to learn, you state that you choose to ignore it... ignorance is bliss."
"Architects - Broken Cross","I feel like that's a thought pattern you have to have to be a Christian in this day and age. Yesyes, I have a neckbeard, a fedora and read the god delusion religiously. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","It's required for being religious at all..."
"Architects - Broken Cross","They were very kickass when I saw them two days ago and this was the first song they played here. I also had fun in the pit since there were no seats and I didn't have that much experience before.

Wish it could've been longer but they played all of LF//LT (with the last and first song as the closer), two songs from Hollow Crown, two from Daybreaker, and one from The Here and Now.

They also announced in the show that their touring second guitarist is now an official member of the band so that's pretty cool."

"Architects - Broken Cross","I love this song- particularly as someone who is distinctly unreligious- but how can you like it as a Christian?... It calls your god a fucking tyrant in a hollow crown? "
"Architects - Broken Cross","I like Silent Planet's music and I'm not Christian. Just because you don't agree with that band's beliefs doesn't mean you have to dislike their music. There's also the fact that Architects raise a fair point in this song, it's not just like 'fuck religion, god isn't real', which is basically what BMTH's House of Wolves is. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","&gt;Just because you don't agree with that band's beliefs doesn't mean you have to dislike their music

Obviously. I'm talking about this particular song, which basically calls this guy's god- who he (from his pov) has a strong personal relationship with- a cunt. The chords may sound nice but I'm wondering why the lyrics he'll be singing along to don't offend or upset him in any way. "
"Architects - Broken Cross","Because the band raise a fair point?"
"Architects - Broken Cross","It's a middle finger against the corruption of organized religion, not my personal belief, that's how I enjoy it duhhhh "

"Memphis May Fire - Prove Me Right (Song about MMF getting screwed over early on in the music industry)","From the Wiki:

&gt;Mullins wrote the song Prove Me Right against the former bands label Trustkill Records and is a critic on the younger music industry:

&gt;″The first single we released was called Prove Me Right. That song is about the music industry and what it does to me. And just kind of realizing that the 15 year old me that just wanted a record deal and thought that people in the music industry were just there to help support you and your dream when the reality of it is that it’s the complete opposite. It’s a bunch of money hungry suits that really don’t care – and I’m not saying that this is everybody – but some of the people that we worked with – people who don’t really care about the music or the art at all. All they see is dollar signs. So that song is about everyone who ever kicked me when I was down – tried to make me feel like I couldn't accomplish what I have today. It’s kind of a middle finger to everybody who ever said I couldn't do it – because I'm here doing it right now.″"

"Frozen Flame tour stories","Just wondering if anyone has any cool stories from when they went to the Frozen Flame tour, the Boston date of that was definitely one of the best shows I've been to"
"Frozen Flame tour stories","I was at the Lawrence show, had a great time. My only complaint was Northlane, something with their sound levels was really messed up and you couldn't even hear any vocals, everything else was good though.

Fit For A King totally blew me away though. I have been a fan for a while, just never seen them live. I thought they honestly sounded the best out off all them that night.

Erra's lead singer was a pretty funny guy. Before the last song he said, ""This next one is so heavy I don't think I will be able to pick it up.""

Miss May I was also really good, which was surprising to me.

ABR had some intense energy, they did not screw around between songs, and just kept going like a bunch of machines. The lights were amazing, along with that badass drum solo part.

In the end, the VIP tickets were worth it. The best $60 I have spent in a long time."
"Frozen Flame tour stories","I like going to the gym, so when Jake took 20 minutes to stop and talk about this protein powder, it really connected with me and I felt like ''wow he's just like me'' and it saved my life"
"Frozen Flame tour stories","Corejerk seems to be leaking into this sub again..."
"Frozen Flame tour stories","I never go on corejerk, just thought the protein thing was funny when he did it"
"Frozen Flame tour stories","Ah, true, seems like it was just a one time thing though, he didn't do it at the date I went to"
"Frozen Flame tour stories","All I know is that that was the best I've seen them for about the past two years. That huge break they took off to write really helped Jake out a lot.

My favorite part though was [Jake pig-squealing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igDaU6Qla14#t=179) to the end of Back Burner. I was up in front and was just jacked up to hear it like that. The video doesn't do it justice though! ;)"
"Frozen Flame tour stories","Yeah, Back Burner is always crazy live, and Jake's pig-squeals just make it even crazier. It's funny, I'm usually not a fan of them, but when Jake does them it sounds great"
"Frozen Flame tour stories","I was at that show! And yeah, he stated doing the squeals my jaw fell. 

That show was so fun, it was soon out I found out after and man, it was packed. My ankles were all brushed up from how crowded the front was. Incredible show. "
"Frozen Flame tour stories","Yeah dude, I got stuck looking for my buddy haha and it was so damn cold out!!"
"Frozen Flame tour stories","It was fricking cold waiting to get in. Haha, it was my buddy's first show ever, and he was mad that I made him do shorts and a tank when we were outside... But he understood once the pit stated getting hot. "
"Frozen Flame tour stories","Dude I totally feel you. I normally wear shorts to all my concerts up in the cities, but I had a vip pass so I went with pants? Why? And a button up? I ruined it up front hahaha."
"Frozen Flame tour stories","Haha, it was hot in there for sure. "
"Frozen Flame tour stories","I was at the show in Cleveland, and it was my first time in the pit. Had a guy crowdsurfing fall on my head and almost break my neck, but it was definitely worth it! Crossroads had some good food too, so if you guys are ever there check em out. "
"Frozen Flame tour stories","It's was just as expected, ABR killed it. I knew I'd enjoy Fit For A King's set, even though I'm not a huge fan. I liked Miss May I when they played their good songs(Monument era). 

I also had to take an elevator to the upper floor for accessible seating, because I had slang my ankle and had to use crutches. The view ways just above on the right of the stage so I got to see everything. 

On the way up to that seat Ryan Neff held the elevator door so I could get on. I didn't say anything because it was before the show and he seemed like he was getting in the zone. I don't know, I thought it was cool."
"Frozen Flame tour stories","I'm seeing them tonight and reading through this is just getting me so hyped!"
"Frozen Flame tour stories","i was at the boston show and the most memorable part was fit for a king doing warpath. Ryan is so sick live."
"Frozen Flame tour stories","That's the show I was at too, Fit For a King was definitely great, and I got to talk to Ryan for a while after the show"
"Frozen Flame tour stories","hes a super nice down to earth dude"
"Frozen Flame tour stories","He really is"
"Frozen Flame tour stories","Yeah, dude, that was the best show I've ever been too. As I commented earlier today, August Burns Red is so amazing live, their album's don't do em justice. They're so tight (although Jake messed up once near the end), they're jumping around and still sound fantastic. And *their lighting is AMAZING.* Seriously. The flashes and colors were timed and themed to the lyrics and movements in the song. A couple instances that stuck out to me was during the line ""This is our darkest hour"", the lights switched from swirling colors to just a dull yellowish in the back, making  Jake look like a baroque hero silohuetted against the darkness. Also a couple of times, Jake ended the song by closing his fist (like an orchestra conductor does) and the music and roving/flashing lights suddenly stopped, leaving the audience with suddent silence and darkness. Their live show is an all-encompassing, nearly ethereal experience that it's just impossible to get just listening to the albums.And that drum ""solo"" in which all the band members came out on stage and played drums. That was so cool, and definitely not something I've seen any other metalcore band do. Yeah, so, August Burns Red deserves the hype.

The other bands were really good too, I don't really listen to them, but Northlane and Miss May I were extremely entertaining (and Miss May I's clean singer was actually really good, something we didn't get with Erra. Seriously, that guy was shrieky.) Fit For A King was cool. At the end, their vocalist did that super long scream from ""Warpath"" (I am the eneMAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY) for 15-20 seconds. The crowd went wild.

I also bought that August Burns Red Smoky the Bear shirt that says ""ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT HORRIBLE MUSIC"". Saw that one in 2013 and I wanted it then but had no money.

Final thoughts: You just need to see ABR live for yourself because, even though I could probably accurately describe just how phenomenal they are, I don't have the patience. Seriously. Go see them next time they're in your town.

Ninja edit: Just to plug the lighting one more time, by best friend was with me, and he says the only band he's ever seen with better lighting than ABR was Pink Floyd."
"Frozen Flame tour stories","Yea that long scream was insane. I couldn't believe how long he did it.... seriously that was impressive."
"Frozen Flame tour stories","Yeah, it was definitely a great show, I really liked Erra's clean vocalist though, sure, he has a high-pitched voice, but the parts sounded really good live. Also, I have that same shirt, got it at their 2013 fall headliner."
"Frozen Flame tour stories","&gt;A couple instances that stuck out to me was during the line ""This is our darkest hour"", the lights switched from swirling colors to just a dull yellowish in the back, making Jake look like a baroque hero silohuetted against the darkness.

That could be the most beautiful description of a concert I have ever read. And I absolutely cannot wait until they come to my city now. My body is ready."
"Frozen Flame tour stories","I found Jesus. "
"Frozen Flame tour stories","His name is Matt Greiner, but he cut his hair yes."

"I got a really good metalcore Playlist going here. If there's any other good songs I'm missing then please say something","Needs a lot more variety. You just have 3 bands. I would say make a radio station out of your playlist and add whatever song comes on that you like."
"I got a really good metalcore Playlist going here. If there's any other good songs I'm missing then please say something","Blessthefall, Bury Tomorrow, AILD, The Word Alive, FFAK would all make good additions"
"I got a really good metalcore Playlist going here. If there's any other good songs I'm missing then please say something","The term ""good"" is very subjective. What might be ""good"" to you might just be average to another person. 

That being said you could use more bands than just like 5. There are bands out there that are just as good if not better than the ones you have there. 

I recommend you try the radio feature on spotify. It's really good imo."
"To all beartooth fans.","Hello guys, at first i want to say sorry about my horrible grammar, since im from Poland and english is not my native language. So the main reason that i created this post for is the fact that I basically have started listening to Beartooth few months ago and there my question comes- do you know any similiar bands to them? I know that Caleb previously has been in Attack Attack, but was recently wondering about other bands that might have similiar style to BT. Thanks in advance guys !
"
"To all beartooth fans.","Nothing sticks out in terms of soundalikes but try While She Sleeps, Every Time I Die, Letlive, Climates, The Color Morale, Stray From The Path."
"To all beartooth fans.","+1 for The Color Morale. I really don't like the direction they're going. But they're definitely close to how Beartooth sounds. Really angsty vocals now. "
"To all beartooth fans.","Yeah, there's not much like it. Perhaps you might like more hardcore-ish stuff like The Ghost Inside, or Stick to Your Guns? That's part of the draw of Beartooth though, they really are the only ones with that sound. "
"To all beartooth fans.","Woah, actually Stick to Your Guns seems suprisingly close to BT for me. Thanks dude!:)
"
"To all beartooth fans.","Thought you might enjoy! My personal favorite track from them is ""Amber."" But most of their first couple albums are solid!"
"To all beartooth fans.","Her name is AMBER"
"To all beartooth fans.","I was watching them at Warped '13 with my gf (she's not into hardcore/metalcore that much) but there was no one else really playing. That part kicked in and I just looked at her and she gave a nod of approval and I just tore for the pits. It was a grand time. "
"To all beartooth fans.","Thats actually what I was looking for concidering I didn't think I'm gonna find something , this has its own characteristics besides being similiar to BT which fits my music style well :)"
"To all beartooth fans.","I'm so glad you made this post, I've been going through the same thing where I couldn't find any bands like Beartooth and STYG seems to be the closest thing that I can find. Thanks to you and /u/andreasmiles23"
"To all beartooth fans.","Be sure to check out their new album Disobedient. It's not their greatest work but it is really similar to Beartooth's Disgusting. "
"To all beartooth fans.","Check out My Ticket Home's first album. IIRC several members of Beartooth were on that record. "
"To all beartooth fans.","I think their album Strangers Only would be a good recommendation as well, it's more raw sounding."
"To all beartooth fans.","It sounds a bit more nu-metal though. But definitely a good CD. Might have to listen to it again today. "
"To all beartooth fans.","[deleted]"
"To all beartooth fans.","The way I understand it, the members that were in My Ticket Home before Beartooth weren't on Stranger's Only. 

"
"To all beartooth fans.","Shomo also produced their first EP and first full length."
"To all beartooth fans.","I saw them last year on tour with Architects up here in Canada. I'm pretty sure they're out repping SO right now but I'm sure they'll put out a new record at some point."
"To all beartooth fans.","Holy shit, that sounds almost exactly like This Means War "
"To all beartooth fans.","But PUKE ROCK!"
"To all beartooth fans.","I asked this in here a while back. Its hard to find anything similar! :("
"To all beartooth fans.","Caleb collaborated with Tear Out The Heart on their first album, 'Violence', on their excellent crowd track undead anthem. He just produced their second album, 'Dead, Everywhere'. If you're looking for an awesome, talented and passionate up and coming band who is influenced by the Caleb Shomo sound, look no further. 

Source- gigantic fucking Beartooth fan, destroyed my leg for them at warped 2014. "
"To all beartooth fans.","Their first EP reminds me a bit of The Chariot at times, you might also like Defeater"
"To all beartooth fans.","well sylar sounds a tad similiar for me, but the only real soundalike you will find is the last attack attack album and maybe try some things calbe produced like Come The Dawn"
"To all beartooth fans.","Definitely My Ticket Home, Gideon and Every Time I Die. I would also check out some of the bands Caleb produces. They often have very similar guitar tones and ultimately similar sounding tracks. Come the Dawn, Tear Out The Heart, Sylar (more nu-metal and less punk than Beartooth) and again, My Ticket Home come to mind. "
"To all beartooth fans.","Well tbh I expected that there will be no perfect match for BT, cuz Caleb's overall acoustics and screams are somewhat unique. From what u guys recommended i find sylar,and come the dawn fair enough. Thanks guys for your tries, guess gonna have to wait for their new album:)
"
"To all beartooth fans.","pretty much anything Shomo produces sounds like his style, like Sylar"
"To all beartooth fans.","Stray From the Path, My Ticket Home and While She Sleeps."
"To all beartooth fans.","letlive, and the early The Color Morale albums. "

"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","Same pretty much"
"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","Same here with Restoring Force. I kinda liked some of the songs when it released, but quickly got bored with them. Any remaining appeal they had was destroyed by this sub a long time ago lol.

Still jamming Sempiternal though."
"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","Not metalcore, but Hail to the King was good for about a week and then I jumped off the fanbase. In terms of metalcore, 8:18 lost interest after about a month for me. "

"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","Funny that the new Slaves, Beartooth, and BMTH are all top voted in this post and they are my three favorite albums to come out in the past couple years lol."
"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","I would say Restoring Force but it's not entirely true.  I tried really hard to like it when it came out but I just found myself resenting it even more."
"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","Not metalcore to be exact, but mine's gotta be Through Art We Are All Equals by Slaves.

It was great at first, but it slowly became 'Meh' to the point that i became dissapointed in it. There are some great songs that i still listen till today, but the whole album was kinda forgettable as a whole. Easily JC's weakest project to date."
"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","I've listened to the album a few times, but the only song that really stuck out to me was My Soul is Empty and Full of White Girls"
"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","That song, The Fire Down Below &amp; This Is You Throwing In The Towel are the only songs I'm hooked with. The other songs are easily forgettable."
"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","Yeah, The Fire Below wasn't bad either"
"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","I feel like anything by JC gets old pretty fast. He just sings the same melodies over and over again."
"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","Bro do you even DGD"
"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","Probably everything Demon Hunter. They were the band that got me into metalcore and I listened to them for over a year. Since they were my gateway band I did not know any other bands. I still enjoy them occasionally, but I have expanded my horizons to pretty much all metalcore, deathcore, and melodic hardcore ever made."
"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","I'm right there with you on this one. I loved Demon Hunter, and I still know that they are pretty cool, but whenever I listen to anything they do now I like it for about 3 days then leave it for like 4 years before I give it a single spin, and repeat. Just no spark there for me any more."
"Albums you liked at first, but then lost interest pretty quickly","I'm ashamed, but when ETID - Ex-Lives came out, I listened to it a few times and just shelved it in favour for the previous work. I then listened to it randomly one day on the way from work and it just clicked with me, and now it's probably in my top three ETID records."

Always has a place in my heart, but Hollow was surely my favorite. I don't understand Unconditional hate...I think it's better than Challenger."
"Memphis May Fire - Be Careful What You Wish For (throwback to when they were good)","I don't get the Unconditional hate either, but it certainly isn't better than Challenger. Challenger was a solid album for sure, whereas Matty's lyrics got more preachy and the mixing was off on Unconditional, which turned just about everyone off. "
"Memphis May Fire - Be Careful What You Wish For (throwback to when they were good)","Yeah I don't know, I liked Challenger...but there was just something about it that I didn't like as much as Hollow or Unconditional. I'm Christian myself so that's probably why I like the new lyrics more haha, but no doubt The Hollow had the best lyrics by far."

"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","I a word."
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","It's legit as fuck in terms of Pop Punk. The Wonder Years, Trophy Eyes, Neck Deep, Transit, Have Heart, Handguns, Seaway, As It Is and others. For Metalcore... Not really. "
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","Well, you see, metalcore isn't the only genre of music that people like. It's called variety. "
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","Transit is fucking amazing and is probably the best band announced at the moment."
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","Honestly I'd go to the Houston date for RiFF RAFF haha"
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","rotting out and being as an ocean...two bands :(
seaway is awesome but they are local for me"
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","Asking Alexandria are there for the first time since 2011 so a lot of people are definitely going to want to go. The line up is definitely not the best though, I haven't even heard of most of the bands on it. It seems like there's a lot of young and new bands playing."
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","Asking Alexandria also doesn't have Danny any more, so hopefully their live performance still packs a punch"
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","Well assuming they replace him with someone who doesn't dress up as a cowboy and try to turn their songs into Def Leppard covers, I think their live show will be just fine.

Otherwise, #ClassicRock4Life"
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","My thoughts exactly. Hopefully their new vocalist doesn't have scarf on the mic stand and cowboy boots."
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","Imo any tour with Blessthefall, the wonder years, abd neck deep is pretty tight "
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","In terms of the lineup, this year is undoubtedly one of the worst in recent years. But kids will want to go, for the reasons given by other users. However unfortunate it is that kids like Black Veil Brides, Asking Alexandria, etc., it's a fact of life and Kevin Lyman's just trying to bring in money. That's how it goes."
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","Warped Tour is almost always shitty, but this year they're really going over the top in shitty. Mayhem's looking real nice this year. Can't wait for that. "
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","Who's all going to Mayhem so far?"
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","I don't think they have said thus far?"
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","I'm stoked af. I'll get to see AA, Amity Affliction, and Our Last Night. All three bands I've wanted to see for a while, especially TAA and OLN. And warped has had rappers and stuff before, and they've always had pretty large amounts of pop punk bands, so I see no problem."
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","Asking isn't coming to my show. :( but I'm not saying Warped sucks now, but I'm just bothered that the days of Whitechapel suicide silence and parkway all being on the tour are over. But I'm still over the moon that Trophy Eyes, While She Sleeps, and BAAO are gonna be there."
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","I would be so happy if PWD went to warped"
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","So far the only bands I'm looking forward to are Fit For a King, Blessthefall, Being as an Ocean, and Hudredth"
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","My inside sources are telling me Memphis May Fire is still to be announced, as well as the rest of the bands from The Get Real Tour. So that's 5 more solid metalcore bands for ya.

But the BVB hate is a little unwarranted these days. In my opinion. They are no longer the scene stars they once were with their first album, when they were coming out on stage all decked out in leather and war paint. These days they sound like a poor man's A7X, and just put out their least ""hate-able"" album yet. That being said, I know they have a ton of fans still in this scene and it makes sense for them to play Warped even though they no longer have a Warped Tour sound. So basically, if you don't wanna see them, don't. If you go to Warped, there's like 10 stages. For this reason exactly. "
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","I'd say that their last album, wretched and divine was the most easily likable. Their newest is just boring. "
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","I agree with that dude, W&amp;D is solid (and so damn catchy) but the s/t gets a little boring after a few spins. "
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","Except the word alive "
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","The word alive puts on a solid show and plays from every album. Whether you like their latest album or not, you'll here something you like. "
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","I meant TWA isn't gonna be on warped, but every other band from that tour is."
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","I am not a metalcore bashing elitist. I'm not one of those douches that claims Warped hasn't been good since the 90s. I love Warped. I love metalcore. That's why I go. So when they transitioned from primarily punk to metalcore I was really happy. But now it's almost as if they're going from metalcore to pop or to basically just shitty scene music. We can just hold out hope I guess that the headliners are going to be heavy, but selling my ticket and going to Summer Slaughter or Mayhem sounds really appealing now. I mean, Black Veil Brides... really!?! Sorry rant over. Anybody else have any opinions on this?"
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","The scene changes. This isn't the first time Black Veil Brides has been on the tour. Last time they were, the crowd I saw watching them was quite large. Their music is popular among the crowd Warped draws in. I'm not a fan of BVB, but I also don't think they are shit. It would be dumb for Warped to not take this band on tour, because it brings them money. More money = more Warped. There have been some good bands announced so far, just wait, I'm sure more bands you like will be announced."
"Well, that was probably the worst Warped announcement of the year. How does Warped thinks people are going to want go?","I definitely feel like warped has transitioned to fit with them times... and popular bands these times in the scene is pop... so theyre just doing what they can to attract kids. However I Killed the Prom Queen, The Amity Affliction, Fit For A King, Blessthefall, Sirens &amp; Sailors, Hundredth, and Crossfaith are all on the tour and those are bands ill for sure be checking out so there is still a strong possibility of more metalcore being announced. hold tight!:)"

"Anyone seen Invent, Animate live?","Will you guys ever play Lightfinder?"
"Anyone seen Invent, Animate live?","might bring it back if we get a longer set. been playing it since it was released so it's kind of old to us now. in most cases we're on tours where we're trying to promote Everchanger, so we want to showcase that material, naturally. this upcoming tour with veil of maya and after the burial will actually be the first time it hasn't been in the set since its release. "
"Anyone seen Invent, Animate live?","That makes sense. I haven't gotten a chance to see you guys yet, but hope to soon. I remember when hieroglyphs came out haha thanks for the response! "
"Anyone seen Invent, Animate live?","that is a dope setlist"
"Anyone seen Invent, Animate live?","Just listen to all over their new album, ""Everchanger"", along with the singles ""Wolf Skin"" and ""Lightfinder"".

They said for this upcoming tour that they will be playing more stuff from Everchanger."
"Anyone seen Invent, Animate live?","edit: not on setlist.fm"
"Anyone seen Invent, Animate live?","If I had to guess, the first 3 songs off Everchanger will be played. Check setlist.fm after they start this tour, someone will probly post their list"
"Anyone seen Invent, Animate live?","I hope they play the desperate are the calm.  Everything off of Everghanger is soo good."
"Anyone seen Invent, Animate live?","Yeah, they are nothing short of awesome. I know all of the dudes personally and they are all great guys. Go talk to em after the show and tell 'em how sick they are. They'd appreciate it.

"Oceans Ate Alaska - Part Of Something (NEW 2015) (GREAT STUFF)","For reals, its all amazing"
"Oceans Ate Alaska - Part Of Something (NEW 2015) (GREAT STUFF)","I've been getting really bored of recent metalcore releases but I'm really enjoying this album."
"Oceans Ate Alaska - Part Of Something (NEW 2015) (GREAT STUFF)","Can't stop listening to this album. Linger is probably my favorite track off it :D"
"Oceans Ate Alaska - Part Of Something (NEW 2015) (GREAT STUFF)","Wow, I really enjoyed that. Please tell me their other stuff is as heavy and also doesn't have whiny ass clean vocals. "
"Oceans Ate Alaska - Part Of Something (NEW 2015) (GREAT STUFF)","The only song that really has a good bit of cleans is Floorboards, most of the album is heavy, I really like it."
"Oceans Ate Alaska - Part Of Something (NEW 2015) (GREAT STUFF)","This album is absolutely fantastic. Their cleans are tolerable but the huge british accent makes it hard to be tolerable"
"Oceans Ate Alaska - Part Of Something (NEW 2015) (GREAT STUFF)","As someone who loved Blood Brothers and wants to check out that album, what is the ratio of cleans to screams? "
"Oceans Ate Alaska - Part Of Something (NEW 2015) (GREAT STUFF)","2:8 Maybe even 1:9. Floorboards is the only song that has quite a bit of cleans. Blood Brothers is 100% my favorite song on the album."
"Oceans Ate Alaska - Part Of Something (NEW 2015) (GREAT STUFF)","I hated the cleans on this album so much, which is a shame because I enjoyed the rest quite a bit."

"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Sky, the bassist of Issues posed that question to his followers on twitter and I thought it was pretty cool, so I'm moving that discussion here. To elaborate, I'm asking an album on par with Chasing Safety, one that will be held to that regard that came out recently. 


I understand that there probably aren't a whole lot, but we can also discuss why those albums are held to such standard. I'd say my choices are Homesick for metalcore and TDAGARIM by Brand New for more that style."
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","I guess With Roots Above And Branches Below isn't recent enough? I'll say Northlane's Singularity for metalcore and Acceptance Speech by Dance Gavin Dance for post-hardcore."
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","TDWP was the AP band of the year in 2010 so I guess it counts? "
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","[deleted]"
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","The Emptiness by Alesana. The Thespian was the first song I ever heard that had screaming elements, and from there I was forever hooked on heavier genres. Alesana was one of the first popular -core bands to introduce interesting conceptual albums (along with Periphery, of course) in the ""new wave"" of -core. I feel as though The Emptiness in particular was very impactful. I can't find a single mediocre song on the album, and it serves to tell an intriguing tale based on the workings of Edgar Allen Poe. "
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","I agree, although it's not really a scene-changer or like super influential. Very good, but not a whole lot of people cite it or alesana as much of an influence I don't think."
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","I think it will get more influential as time goes on. The band has really been into their local music scene and I wouldn't be surprised if a band gets huge. "
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","That's interesting, considering how many fans they have. I personally cite Alesana as one of my influences (out of literally hundreds of bands that I listen to), but I think you're correct in stating that not a whole lot of people do. "
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","not a huge fan of the first 2 but sempeternal, stand up and scream, and with roots above and branches below"
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Probably Son I Loved You At Your Darkest by As Cities Burn, Juturna by Circa Survive, and Mirrors by Misery Signals. If we're talking last 10 years those have got to be it. Everyone else is posting shit that came out like, yesterday."
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Son I Loved You At Your Darkest by As Cities Burn is such a phenomenal album that I feel is way underappreciated. Grat too see some love for ACB here. "
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","""Son I Loved You at Your Darkest"" is quite possibly one of the greatest post-hardcore albums ever composed. Whenever it comes on, I can't even skip a song. "
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Sempiternal?"
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","I could definitely agree with Sempiternal. "
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","yeah not a fan but definitly"
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Honestly, I cannot think of a single album that rivals Chasing Safety. That album was so widely appreciated across the different, albeit, similar, genres of the scene."
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Probably Constellations by August Burns Red. Not my favorite of theirs, but probably their most ""defining"" album"
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Is it really renowned as a classic to most people in the scene? I'm regrettably just getting into ABR. "
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","I'd say so, though with the love/hate relationship this sub seems to have with ABR, I'm not sure how many people here would agree with me. Regardless, they're definitely a popular band in the genre, and Constellations is really the album that defined their sound"
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","I'd say Messengers over Constellations "
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Possibly, I just personally feel like Constellations has more potential"
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","By going by the ""classic"" thing, I feel like Messengers fits better idk :/"
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","I feel like Messangers is more of a classic now, where Constellations has more potential to be a classic in the future"
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","What about Rescue &amp; Restore? I'm pretty sure that album has the least amount of haters for any ABR record."
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","I think that the next Architects release will be on that level. You can all hold me to that."
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","I could see that, but they have to be more ground breaking and different for that to happen, in my opinion. To clarify for everyone else, I meant albums that have already been released, but thanks for your response nonetheless haha :)"
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Yeah, I couldn't think of a recent metalcore album that could be given that kind of praise, so I cheated a bit. I think Architects have steadily developed and grown as a band over their last few albums, so if their next is an improvement on LF//LT, then it's going to be massive. 

Also, excellent calls on Homesick and TDAGARIM. Two of my favorite albums."
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Think the last 10 years, like Suicide Season."
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Definitely disagree 

Edit: but I find them over-hyped. Great band, but over-hyped. "
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","I would've said Common Courtesy as the metalcore/pop punk classic/standard. I thought it was surprisingly solid. And Semipiternal is very good for illustrating the current trend of evolving into nu-metal influenced, while still maintaining individuality and quality. Northlane's Singularity I think will be considered pretty classic for the sort of prog metalcore crowd.
And OM&amp;M's The Flood is, to me, a classic for Risecore type bands. And don't think im bashing it, I love it. "
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Homesick, Roots Above, and MAYBE Sempiternal will be hailed as classics, if anything from this generation will be. Though it's much too soon to tell."
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Sempiternal 

The flood 

Homesick 
"
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","This, but I'd also add *Stand Up And Scream* since it helped popularize the genre."
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","It's hard to say since there's a lot more variation nowadays.  But as far as my vote goes I'd probably have to give it to Issues self-titled.  Really innovative and catchy stuff.  Stoked for their new album."
"What would you guys consider a newer ""classic"" in the ""AP"" / warped scene?","Quick comment: It's interesting that the post still has 0 upvotes despite the replies. "

"Norma Jean-Memphis Will Be Laid To Waste The first song to get me into metalcore back in 2004...","Yeah I'm double lucky because I happened to be in Cleveland a few years back when Norma Jean and the Chariot toured together and that night Norma Jean played Bless the Martyr from beginning to end and Josh came out and sang an entire song.

So much better than the bullshit this most of this genre has turned into.

Seriously lyrics are fucking awful these days"

"Norma Jean-Memphis Will Be Laid To Waste The first song to get me into metalcore back in 2004...","Well I guess it really is a matter of opinion but I've always been found of Underoath's lyrics. If I had to pick a favourite though it would have to be a tie between Converge, the Chariot and Fear Before (specifically the Always Open Mouth).

No Knock: As boring as new Attila. It actually sounds like they're trying to be Attila.  2/ 5

Divide: Ungodly levels of buttrock here, this could be the [theme to a sonic game] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gPBmDptqlQ). 3.5/ 5

The Greatest Generation: Don't care for this one, just mediocre chugcore. I can hear glimpses of what they used to be though, and  the chorus is great. They need to stick with the buttrock segments. 2.5/ 5

For You: Forgettable acoustic ballad. 2/ 5

A Reason for Me to Fight: Pretty good melodic metalcore song, with a forgettable breakdown. 3.5/ 5

Victory Lap: Pretty groovy buttrock with a touch of metalcore, Having not listened to anything from these guys other than The Fall of Ideals, it's good to hear that he can still growl. 3.5/ 5

Pernicious: More forgettable chugcore, but the guitar solo is nice. Reminds me of old Asking Alexandria. 2/ 5

Bite My Tongue: Killer drum intro into a catchy clean section? I'm on board from the get go. And an At the Gates Riff right after? Fuck yeah. Chill ass bass interlude in the middle? And a guitar solo. 4.5/ 5

Flat Empire: Forgettable ballad with pointless chugging 1.5/ 5

Tru-kvlt Metal: One of the worst song titles I've heard since TDWP's early days, and I like it. I like those song titles. The song itself is great. It's finally the All That Remains that I love. And the first good breakdown of the album. Though too much focus is on the breakdowns, which holds it back a bit. It reminds me of Indictment, but with a little less charm. 4/ 5

Criticism and Self Realization: A 7 minute metalcore song? That's fucking risky. And it doesn't work. The softer moments are good enough, but the metalcore segments are bland. This would be boring as a 4 minute song, but it's excruciating as a 7 minute one. 1.5/ 5

FInal verdict:  It's not awful, which is better than I was expecting. But there's no reason for it to be almost 50 minutes long. 

Rating: 3/ 5

"All That Remains 'The Order Of Things' album stream","Relistening to the album whilst reading your thoughts on each song, and i agree with most of your assesment.

In regards to the Tru-kvlt metal title, they intentionally made it sound stupid because they were tired of people comparing their latest efforts to TFOI.
"
"All That Remains 'The Order Of Things' album stream","I do like the fact that the title is stupid. "
"All That Remains 'The Order Of Things' album stream","pernicious is my fav song off the album"
"All That Remains 'The Order Of Things' album stream","honestly this is a really good rock/metal album. I've always loved this band. There is a couple stand out songs in this album, and Phil sounds pretty good on this one. "
"All That Remains 'The Order Of Things' album stream","it does have a lot of radio friendly songs but songs like ""This probably won't end well"", ""Pernicious"", and ""Tru-Kvlt-Metal"" are really good. "
"All That Remains 'The Order Of Things' album stream","ATR, for me, are a very hit-or-miss band. I usually cannot listen to their albums (outside TFOI) from start to finish. 

Not a fan of Phil's sing/talk vocal style he has been using during the verses of ATR songs. He never had a *great* clean voice, and the fact that more and more of their songs rely on his cleans is a turn-off for me.

Their earlier work was carried mostly by Phil's aggressive screams and some sweet riffs by Oli and Mike on guitar. I feel like this album lacks both. The guitar was pretty 'meh' in comparison with their previous efforts.

I do, however, really enjoy the fact that they're finally using Jeanne's vocals now. Adds a nice element that isn't common in the genre, but certainly welcome.

Overall an OK album imo. 2.5/5"
"All That Remains 'The Order Of Things' album stream","I really like the album"
"As We Walk - Sardonic (Official Lyric Video)",""
"As We Walk - Sardonic (Official Lyric Video)","It's a shame they've switched to female cleans now. Gonna miss Nick's cleans. Still nice to listen to though."
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Personally it's a tie between Jesse Cash of Erra and Ahren Stringer of The Amity Affliction."
"Favorite clean vocalist?","I like Aaron Gillespie of Underoath most. He just has this drive in his voice where when he sings really loud it sounds like he's almost screaming, and it really adds to the oomph of the vocals."
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Yeah I can see what you're talking about, definitely up there for me."

"Favorite clean vocalist?","Lots of people like Jesse. His vocals and guitar playing are top notch. "
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Yeah I know but a lot of my friends can't get into his voice which I don't understand. His solos are some of my favorite of the genre, I can listen to the Hybrid Earth solo for days on end. "

"Favorite clean vocalist?","Spencer is amazing with From First to Last too. "
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Oh. If we're commenting with non-metalcore ones too, then it's hands down Stu Block. [Timeless Winter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nQ4ZR-NI6A) and [Suspension of Disbelief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqPZuGVOBzE) are amazing. "
"Favorite clean vocalist?","I'd say probably Marcus Bridge at the moment, and his cleans are also great live"
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Rot is phenomenal, how's his stage presence? I'm going to the frozen flame tour in Houston and can't wait to see Northlane."
"Favorite clean vocalist?","It could use a bit of work, but for someone who just joined a band, and has never toured much before, it's really good, and his vocals sound great, even on the songs from Singularity, not to mention that Rot sounds amazing live"
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Yeah I figured it was gonna take some time, I was interested to see how he handled the older tracks so good to know he's handling it well."
"Favorite clean vocalist?","He definitely is, also really excited to see them live when they have a full album with his vocals"
"Favorite clean vocalist?","[deleted]"
"Favorite clean vocalist?","That's weird, must have just been an off night for him, when I saw them he sounded great on both the cleans and screams"
"Favorite clean vocalist?","[deleted]"
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Fair enough, when was this? I saw them at the Boston show of the Frozen Flame tour, and he sounded fine then"
"Favorite clean vocalist?","[deleted]"
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Ah, that tour was when he was still really new to playing live with Northlane, seems like he got a lot better since then"

"Favorite clean vocalist?","Do enjoy his cleans quite a bit although i do prefer his screams "
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Ahren Stringer from TAA. I don't think he's the most talented dude out there but his voice is really catchy and suits the band well. Gives off a lot of emotion too"
"Favorite clean vocalist?","TAA's choruses are some of the catchiest I've ever heard. "
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Caleb shomo from beartooth. His vocals are just raw and not girly "
"Favorite clean vocalist?","His stage presence is awesome too, the Beartooth headliner in Houston was one of the most insane shows I've been to. "
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Yeah sadly I haven't are him with beartooth only with attack attack back in 2012. "
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Brennan Chaulk of [Haste the Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbNTBCL5veU). "
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Wow I've never really listened to these guys but now I wanna get into them, what are good songs to start with?"

For each one:

Burning Bridges - Blue 42, or Song of Faith

* Dennis Tvrdik (Affiance) 

"
"Favorite clean vocalist?","This was my exact list, along with Jesse Cash and Mike Lessard"

"Favorite clean vocalist?","Jesse Cash of Erra, Chris Hutka of The Bunny The Bear, Heri Joensen of Tyr (Viking metal, best low cleans I've ever heard), Salvatore Marrano of Thank You Scientist (Progressive Rock/Experimental).

"Favorite clean vocalist?","Hance Alligood."
"Favorite clean vocalist?","Jeremy Depoyster from TDWP, i've always been a fan of his vocals but from Zombie EP to 8:18 he has been improving a lot. Especially live, he used to be quite sloppy live but now he is way better."

"So what's up with tape on the mics?","I've seen multiple bands have a mic taped all the way around even onto the wire a little. Is this just to keep it on in case they like swinging it around/other stuff?"
"So what's up with tape on the mics?","It's so the mic doesn't get disconnect from the XLR cable. When you're swinging it around the cable could pop out and there goes a mic and that could hurt"
"So what's up with tape on the mics?","Yea. Jake from August Burns Red used to tape the shit out of his mic because he used to swing it around over his head and stuff. I don't think he does that as much anymore, though. Probably broke too many mics or hit someone with it a few too many times haha. "
"So what's up with tape on the mics?","Seen them 3 times in the last y at and a half, he still dose. "
"So what's up with tape on the mics?","I've seen them 5 times in the last 2 years, and he definitely does"
"So what's up with tape on the mics?","Hmm, I must have missed that the last few times I've seen them I guess. "
"So what's up with tape on the mics?","I saw them last week. Can confirm."
"So what's up with tape on the mics?","Saw them on Friday, was swinging that mic around like a madman. Caught a few pics of it."
"So what's up with tape on the mics?","Yeah, it keeps it from detaching from the cable, I used to tape mine, but then I got a locking cable, which works a lot better"
"So what's up with tape on the mics?","Even if you aren't swinging it around it's kind of become an industry best practice to loop the xlr cord up and tape it to the body of the microphone just as a failsafe "
"So what's up with tape on the mics?","cuz it looks cool ofc"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation",""
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","At this point I've accepted that I'll probably never like another song by this band."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Agreed. They were my favorite band for a long time too."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Oh cool they got Austin singing now. Does this mean Aaron can leave and get back to Jamie's Elsewhere or another good band?

I'm not really impressed by this track. It sort of sounds like a boring Linking Park song."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I was really hoping they added Aaron so that they would kick out Austin and have Aaron do all vocals. But alas, those dreams were too daring. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Lol a man can dream. Aaron is obviously not *cute* enough to be their frontman. Let's ignore the fact that he's a way better vocalist."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Sadly that's exactly why Austin is in the band. I do like the new vocalist for Jamie's Elsewhere though, so I'm glad that band is at least still good. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","The singer of Jamie's elsewhere s latest album got kicked out. No statement but Justin posted a message on his own Facebook. I love em, but I doubt they will find a fifth singer..."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","What did his message say? His vocals were so good on Rebel/Revive!"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","They are basically broken up. There has been no statement about it, but I guess he (Kyle, the vocalist) had to finish a tour by himself and then they kinda all just disappeared.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie%27s_Elsewhere#Rebel-Revive_and_Kyle.27s_Departure_.282012-present.29"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","He'd separated from the rest of the band"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Really? When did this happen?

Edit: Just looked at their Facebook, and yeah he's not even listed anymore on there. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I'm pretty sure they didn't even finish the rebel revive tour.."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Ughhhh that breaks my heart a little "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I'm not sure about that, considering that Austin basically started the band in the first place. And IMO Austin used to have some bad ass screams and was one of my favorite vocalists. I think its time we stop considering this band metalcore though, they took a route similar to A7X except with worse songs."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I mean, he did, but they did bring him back to the band after public problems with him. It makes me think that they were just going for the name brand with him. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","They could have. But I think a lot of the reason he was gone in the first place was his heart problems. They also did write one more kick ass album after they brought him back."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","We also know some of his heart stuff was over played. And I agree The Flood was great, but one has to wonder how much Shayley had written of that before Austin came back. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Great point, I really really liked Shayleys voice and it seems that he had a huge part to do with the writing process also."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Yeah, idk. It just seems odd that they went from literally letting someone stand on stage during their sets and being like ""Fuck Austin!"" To welcoming him back with open arms...just smells like a money grab."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Yeah they are still pretty good, though not as good as they were."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I just think of them as separate bands almost. They Said a Storm Was Coming is one of my favorite albums ever, so I knew there was no way they could probably come close to that. But Rebel/Revive is just a fun time. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I mean at this point, its just radio rock. Still, it's nice to hear a band from this scene make it like that. 

Dayshell is still better. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","So boring... lost all hope for this band.
"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I tried to like this song. I really did. But fuck is it ever a let down knowing that this band completely abandoned their roots to move towards a more mainstream sound. Also it sounded a lot like seether"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I think Austin has been spending too much time with Chester Bennington..."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","lol I found it weird enough how they got into a set with Linkin Park. Two different worlds merged in a concert. 

Who honestly went to those concerts to see OMM? A mere 0.1% xD "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Yeah, I wanted to go, but then saw the ticket prices. Unreasonably expensive, honestly. I can wait for Warped.

Though I did see them at a very small venue in Tokyo, and they were amazing, but this was pre Resorting Force days..."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","good ol' days with Shayley.. I'm jealous you had the opportunity to see them before his departure"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","[deleted]"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Well, this was pretty much exactly what I expected. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","The message this song is preaching is some pretty low hanging fruit...""guiseee todays generation uses their phones too much."" "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","who knew that Austin ""Fucking Idiot"" Carlile had nothing at all to say about the world worth taking even remotely seriously?

With songs like ""You're Not Alone"" and ""Still YDG'n"", it's amazing he isn't rated as one of the best lyricists of our age..."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Based Carlile please sing me to sleep &lt;3"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","This isn't metalcore. This is alternative rock. And it's terrible, boring, cookie-cutter alternative rock at that.."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Lmao this is fucking hilarious "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Lol this sounds like edgy radio rock. And the symbolism in the video makes me sick, so ham-fisted."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Of Mice was always headed in this direction and, unfortunately, Pauley just hasn't soothed that burn...


I respect Aaron as a singer but his voice just fails to make me feel *anything*...



Boring, predictable video that's been done a dozen times before, too."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I loved Aaron in Jamie's Elsewhere, but I haven't been a huge fan of OM&amp;M in general lately (as I'm sure most others feel as well). He's a great vocalist, but I don't like him with Austin."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Remember when Of Mice And Men was good? Pepperidge Farms remembers."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","YDG!?"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Still YDG'n"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","This is seriously such a boring song. How the mighty have fallen."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","It's better than the first one I heard, which isn't really saying much. I still just think that there's nothing to keep me listening, it just sounds so bland and boring to me."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Disappointing. 

Sounds like something that would be in the next WWE game."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","NHL 2016 all over this"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I've come to terms Austin has lost all of his talent. This band will never be what it once was. Fuck this song, fuck this new sound, and fuck this band"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","wah wah wah"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Well much better than the other song, but still eh."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","This actually wasnt so bad, considering the god awful title."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I was thoroughly surprised at how much I enjoyed it over the entire RF album. May not pass up the other extra songs since this one blindsided me a bit."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","That's exactly what I was thinking, but if I weigh out this one song versus the whole album, then I don't know if the rest are worth listening to. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","You're joking right?"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Not at all, actually. Sure it's not what they used to be, and that is really disappointing, but if you don't compare it to their old stuff, it's decent nu metal radio rock. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","This is definitely not nu metal. Don't get nu metal mixed up with ""sounds like Linkin Park"". Other than that, I agree completely."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","When did Of Mice &amp; Men become Sleepwave?"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I was freaked out by the beginning, I was like ""who the hell is this"". Didn't think it was that good. I kind of stopped liking Of Mice &amp; Men after the re-release of The Flood."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","It's a lot different from their other songs, but over all I enjoyed it."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","7 upvotes, 58 comments. It's clear that they aren't metalcore anymore; they're only posted here because they USED to be and people enjoy talking about OM&amp;M and their change. If The Ghost Inside can't be posted here, this really shouldn't be able to."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","i like it. I dig the numetal/alternative sound"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Am I the only one who really liked this? Compared to the rest of the stuff on Restoring Force I think this is a great step in the right direction. Sure, a little radio friendly, but that's not even a bad thing."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I like this a lot. I'm a big of Breaking Benjamin/Red so this is great.

That being said, and considering how this band started, this song would have probably been better received by some had this band started with music like this, instead of transitioning to it.

But for what it is, this song is great."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","[deleted]"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Shit, I just posted this. My baaaad."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Sure, this is hardly metalcore, but I didn't think it was all that bad for what it is, which is, not metalcore. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Some people are saying this is a progression to their sound. I disagree. This is just a disappointment. It isn't really ""progression"" when this sounds generally the same as their latest album and any other Breaking Benjamin-esque band out there. Just my opinion. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I knew I wasn't gonna like this song, but a little piece of me wanted to love it so bad. Of Mice &amp; Men used to be so good. It's such a shame. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I feel like somewhere along the way this band lost me. 
I still consider myself a fan, sort of, and I enjoyed Restoring Force for what it was, but I have no idea when that transition from decent scenecore band to early 2000's radio rock happened. What clicked in them to make that move, and why has it been so well received? 

On top of that, when did they get so many Tumblr fangirls? Was it always a thing? Oh well, what're you gonna do. I hardly consider them a metalcore band at this point, but props to them for finding this level of success."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","My life has now been saved."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Why can't nu-metal and 'hard rock' just die forever?"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","because some people like myself enjoy some nu-metal "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","There are plenty that would say the same thing about metalcore and the like."

"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","[deleted]"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","What's your problem?"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I like Aaron's vocals but that's just about it."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Soo much hate here. Doesn't anyone appreciate some sort of change or progression to a band's sound??"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Not really. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I can see that now haha"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Change is good only when it's for the better. In this case it isn't IMO."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","What do you mean by ""for the better?"" For the better of the listener, or the artists?"
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Almost two week old post, but ok. I meant that they haven't changed to a better sound, but a worse one. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Are you really calling me out for a comment on something two weeks old? What does that have to do with anything? Also you didn't really answer my question. You say they have a worse sound now, that's your opinion, totally legitimate. What about the band though? Maybe they, the artists, prefer this sound now, and it's better for them."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I don't really care if their new sound is what they prefer or not. I don't like it myself, therefore I won't listen to it."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","The problem is that there *is* no progression though. Just because a band isn't cookie cutting with breakdowns doesn't mean that they aren't doing that with other sounds. "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","creative.... "
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","Eh it's okay better than most the shit on Restoring Force but still pretty boring. Did like the chorus and bridge though."
"Of Mice &amp; Men - Broken Generation","I like it, it's not great though , I feel they could do more with sound "

"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","Fucking A. Ice Nine Kills took forever for me to get into, but now that I have, I'm just blown away by their work. This song goes in."
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","This is damn good"
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","OH. MY. FUCKING. GOD. 

I have been listening to INK since they would hold signs up at Warped Tour that said ""Come to X Stage, and listen to Ice Nine Kills!"" and it just blows me away to see how far they've come. 

They write amazing lyrics, have amazing vocals, and have PHENOMENAL instrumentals. 

Oh, and the breakdown in this song? One of the most amazing breakdowns I've ever heard. Jesus fuck this song kicks like a Sensei. "
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","Wow."
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","I really liked that a lot, I'm glad they're going down this direction even more so than before."
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","This is wonderful! I could listen to this all day. These guys never fail to impress me!"
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","I've got the song yesterday and I never have listened to a track that many times on one day before. It gave me the same feeling I had when I listen to 'The Greatest story ever told' for the first time. Amazing"
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","This is perfect. This is exactly how I feel. "
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","These guys can do no wrong now, it seems like. "

"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","I've heard this song when it leaked a few days ago. Listened to it atleast 20 times, probably one of my faves by them already. So freaking brilliant and varied."
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","I'm glad you guys are enjoying this track. We put a lot of thought into it and I cannot wait to play it live. Hopefully we'll see u guys on the road with Motionless and For Today!"
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","Still waiting for the promised Europe tour &lt;3 *''soon.. ^tm''*"
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","they sound like a new avenged sevenfold"
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","I hear more of an Atreyu sound with more of a metal edge, and more complex riffs. "
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","Holy Balls Mahoney that was great! If they do release an album this year, it's gonna be a top 5 album for me for sure."
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","""Did you think you could hide from me doctor!"" I fucking love that part."
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","""Even Van Gogh would call it a bloody good impression"" has to be one of the smartest and most clever lyrics I've ever heard in metal."
"Ice Nine Kills - Me Myself &amp; Hyde. New song.","This is awesome! I'm really digging what they're doing here. I'm really excited to see what INK will be putting out from here on out. I've been a fan of these guys for a while and have yet to be disappointed with any of their releases. "

"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","It kills me that they're selling windbreakers too! Why do they love them so much?"
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","In their defense, they are really good looking windbreakers."
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","Now that song always makes me think of Ryan running on to the stage for the beginning of their Frozen Flame tour set"
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","Dude I just got into them in the past week or so and I am seeing them on the Frozen Flame next weekend. I am beyond stoked, I love all 5 of these bands."
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","I got into them around when Slave to Nothing came out, mostly because I decided to check them out after ABR recommended them in a Facebook post, then the Frozen Flame tour got announced and I got even more into them. I agree though, all 5 bands on the tour are great"
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","""YOU'VE GOT BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS!"" 
Pretty sweet live"
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","This album is fantastic..."
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","Amazing band!"
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","Favorite FFAK song, it's so crazy. "
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","so good live too"
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","I miss this clean vocalist. He fits their sound better imo "
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","I get what you mean, but I was kind of bummed that he pretented to be a christian all this time. It's okay to not be a christian, that's not the issue. But to pretend to be something you're not for all these years just so you could stay in a band? Sorry man, but that is low. 

I think their new vocalist is doing an amazing job, though."
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","I definitely agree on you about what he did, but the new guy seems out of place to me on some songs. Idk :/"
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","I like you he new guy more personally. It seems like he fits the more raw sound that they are going for as a band, and he sounds great live. "
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","Definitely agree with this. While the old singer fit the older material better the new guy definitely fits the new material to a T. Also the drummer has some pretty nice pipes as well(did the vocals for the first album + descendants)."
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","Well clean vocals are definitely a big infleunce for the atmosphere in metalcore songs. So it's normal it still feels and sounds weird to some people. I fell in love with his voice the moment I heard it, though. To each their own of course :)"
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","This whole album is a great example of generic metalcore done *really* well. Love this album."
"Fit For A King - Hollow King (Sound of the End)","I agree with this. It's your typical Metalcore album, but FFAK is just so damn good and can be so heavy and in your face it makes for a fucking amazing album "

"Bands all having that same image/dress/style?","I've seen recently, a lot of bands in the -core genre having a similar kind of image/dress.

E.g. Sworn in, Sylar, Palisades.

I like them music-wise, but I don't why they're all jumping on the same image train...

"Bands all having that same image/dress/style?","Not to bothered about what the whole band wears, as all of them wear the same thing.

But it just seems odd, that different bands are dressing alike.
(It'd be like if The Devil Wears Prada, The Color Morale and Upon a Burning Body all wore suits - just random bands I thought here)"
"Bands all having that same image/dress/style?","Crown the Empire all wear matching vests with their logo on it."

"Bands all having that same image/dress/style?","Fuck that audio quality is atrocious."
"Bands all having that same image/dress/style?","The still have an image. Just because they don't dress like Motionless or BVB doesn't mean they don't have a look. If they would dress in a different way it'll make you as a consumer look at they differently. Every band has a image or look. They have to for marketing purposes."
"Bands all having that same image/dress/style?","Right, but it's not like they dress a certain way to try to appeal to a certain fanbase, they just wear what they normally wear"

i mean i've been in contact with rise records' publicist for past AMAs, so i could try for an AMA from a band like OM&amp;M or whatever, but it would just go really, REALLY horribly."

Sorry if this isn't the right place"
"Vocalists of /r/metalcore","If you have $150, get a Shure sm57.  It's probably the most widely used microphone there has ever been.  Great for vocals, drums, guitar, etc.  It's the first mic I ever bought and I still use it every time I record drums or guitar amps.

EDIT you'll want to pick up a stand and a windscreen for vocals.  You can get em both cheap on Amazon with the money you'll have left over.

"Vocalists of /r/metalcore","Go to the biggest studios in the world, and they will almost all use an sm57 on the topside snare.  You can also get great results on toms, bottom snare, spot cymbals, etc. Kick would be better on the batter/beater side for added attack in addition to a proper kick mic, as you won't get a ton of low-end from them."

The difference between metalcore and rap is much greater than the difference between metalcore and deathcore. Plus this post actually got more attention on here than it did on r/deathcore. It isn't even about music necessarily, it's asking to help out musicians. Who cares about the genre here, they need help not listens. Injury or not, their gear and van got totalled."

"Mattie Montgomery - Liberty University Convocation",""
"Mattie Montgomery - Liberty University Convocation","The intro by that guy is exactly why seeing For Today live is horrible. Mattie is more interested in preaching (and they literally admit to it being preaching and call it as such) than he is in putting on a show."
"Mattie Montgomery - Liberty University Convocation","I feel like For Today's reputation for preaching is way overblown. I saw them recently with Silent Planet and Phinehas - two openly Christian bands. They barely preached, and that's one of the settings where Mattie would have been justified to preach quite a bit. Most people I know irl who have seen For Today live with non-christian bands said Mattie preached even less. This is just my personal anecdote though, and it happened pretty recently, so maybe they used to be worse about it."
"Mattie Montgomery - Liberty University Convocation","I've seen For Today north of ten times, and in most cases the preaching works as a filler while the others are switching guitars or tuning... people on Reddit act like they spend 25 minutes of a 30 minute set preaching instead of playing.

//Edit: also, this post is (arguably) not relevant to this subreddit)"
"Mattie Montgomery - Liberty University Convocation","Eh. Tyler Carter, Matty Mullins, and others have their solo stuff posted here all the time and it's not metalcore at all, but it's allowed since it's relevant to popular metalcore figures. This isn't a music project though so it might be more of a stretch. "
"Mattie Montgomery - Liberty University Convocation","I saw them 2 years ago with TDWP and AILD, and For Today preached for longer than both combined. It was unbearable and completely turned me away from them."
"Mattie Montgomery - Liberty University Convocation","you're actually not allowed to criticize For Today in this subreddit because the moshbros4christ show up and downvote you and get super angry.

anyways, anyone remember when their guitarist came out as a homophobe?"
"Mattie Montgomery - Liberty University Convocation","I only saw him get one downvote. For Today gets criticized in this sub all the time in this sub and it gets upvoted, and for perfectly valid reasons. If you're getting downvoted it's probably because you bring up irrelevant stuff like their ex-guitarist saying homophobic stuff 2 years ago."
"Mattie Montgomery - Liberty University Convocation","/u/nohitter21 is getting downvoted in this thread for saying he didn't like the preaching. all of his comments have the little + next to the score meaning he has gotten as many downvotes as upvotes to have only 1 point. do you have the controversial comment icon enabled in your preferences?

tl;dr - each of his comments have gotten like ~15+ upvotes/~15+ downvotes."

also why are we awake right now"
"Mattie Montgomery - Liberty University Convocation","Believe it or not, I actually made it through the entire video and let me tell you, this was VERY different from what I was expecting. He basically admits that ever since he joined For Today, his goal was to pursue fame and preach in his music and make a name for himself to please God. He loved the praise and recognition he would get from people after shows. But he realized that he didn't have to preach to the entire world to be a good Christian and that all he had to do was be faithful. There's one line in particular that struck me and that was when he said ""I'm grateful to be here and have this giant platform to speak, but I'd be just fine without it."" His honesty about himself really changed my view of him, it seems like he's really matured over the years."

"The Night God Slept | Track-By-Track Analysis With Lead Vocalist Garrett",""
"The Night God Slept | Track-By-Track Analysis With Lead Vocalist Garrett","I absolutely love how Garrett breaks down the lyrics behind his songs, I still remember when I first discovered them through a friend of mine, of course they're signed to Solid State, but on the description of each video is references to the bible, or history about what each line and phrase in a song means, it really blew my mind on the thought they put into it.

As for Garrett himself, I really like his view on things, and it amazes me that he's so open things. In a day where things are marked NSFC (Not safe for Christians) because of lyrics and feelings, I only wish more people / musicians took a step out and expressed themself like Silent Planet does, and not hide behind their spirituality and use it as a shield, as well as not using it as an excuse to hurt others. but instead use it as a tool to try spreading some love, the word, and a way of life (following Jesus) albeit in a unique way.

Looking forward to seeing the future of Silent Planet."
"The Night God Slept | Track-By-Track Analysis With Lead Vocalist Garrett","&gt; In a day where things are marked NSFC (Not safe for Christians)

I'm like 99% sure those tags are just a joke. I don't think I've seen anyone get seriously offended by stuff like BMTH or Architects on this sub."
"The Night God Slept | Track-By-Track Analysis With Lead Vocalist Garrett","Yeah it's a joke making fun of the people that legitimately get offended."
"The Night God Slept | Track-By-Track Analysis With Lead Vocalist Garrett","I do agree,  I myself do love Architects and BMTH so I'm obviously biased and will admit that, but then again I'd like to think you can see a bit of where I'm coming from, as a Christian it annoys me to no end when I see others getting so easily offended from music, or feelings behind songs, because they represent part of who we are as a community (Christians, I myself at least).

I just don't like how the minority makes us all look bad I suppose is what I'm trying to say. people need to learn to look past solely lyrics or an artists background, and just enjoy music for what it is sometimes, entertainment and enjoyment through an artist."
"The Night God Slept | Track-By-Track Analysis With Lead Vocalist Garrett","This is fascinating. Every time I listen to that album I find myself caring less about the music (which is great and all) and more about the lyrics. These guys blew my mind and continue to do so knowing how much is packing into the writing. Thanks for posting."
"The Night God Slept | Track-By-Track Analysis With Lead Vocalist Garrett","Dang he touched on a lot of different subjects. All very interesting, all well written, with a good message behind each one."
"The Night God Slept | Track-By-Track Analysis With Lead Vocalist Garrett","Two things:

1. I wish to strangle who ever edited that video, so many cuts and fading to white. Ugggg.

2. I cannot even put words to how much respect I have for that band and Garrett in particular. Silent Planet is one of the few bands proving that you can make heavy af music without completely throwing out musicianship and lyricism. The way that he references so many different works, but not so many that it seems that he isn't writing anything new, just blows my mind.

Needless to say I cannot wait until they come to my town and/or put out new music."
"The Night God Slept | Track-By-Track Analysis With Lead Vocalist Garrett","Really interesting. I've listened to this album so many times I've kind of made my own interpretations of the songs, so it was interesting to see the meaning behind each of them. 

Also met Garrett at a show a few weeks ago and he was a super cool guy, which makes me like their music even more. "
"The Night God Slept | Track-By-Track Analysis With Lead Vocalist Garrett","Garrett is super awesome. I've seen them twice and talked to him afterwards both times and had great conversations about music and life and whatnot. "

The vocalist and the drummer have great potential I liked the uncleans a lot however the cleans and the generic strings left me wanting something better. at least the drummer tried to change it up but it seemed like they just wanted to go chugga chugga chu chu!"

Thank you guys all for joining us! We've gotta get ready for the show tonight in Dallas. Hope to see you all on the Life Reaper 2015 Tour!"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","How do you guys feel about atheistic lyrics like in BMTH and Motionless in White? Do you think it's fine and just an expression of their beliefs or do you have a problem with them?

Also, do you think Spotify/YouTube is good for the music industry or bad?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","They aren't a Christian band anymore"

Conor"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","What about Verb The Noun?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Do you still consider yourselves a Christian metalcore band?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Were just a ground of dudes who want to inspire people through our music. I wouldn't consider it a Christian band but we do have Christian like influence in some of our music. I feel like narrowing us to open particular category pulls away from all the other subjects we touch on. -Shawn"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","How do you feel about the comparisons you get to August Burns Red regarding your sound?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","I personally love it because I've always loved that band. Definitely not ashamed of the comparison, makes me think we're doing something right! -Aaron"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","I dont personally think our newer stuff is abr like but as far as T&amp;amp;P/TAMS go, they were very metal core influenced so you will hear similarities. -Shawn"

"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","I feel like TAMS is the only one slightly similar to Messengers ABR. "
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","I just wanted to ask since I've always felt like I The Breather and Texas In July sounded like they were **heavily** influenced by Messengers era August Burns Red."
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Truuuu"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","For a band of your level, what is the financial situation/outlook like? I don't want specifics since that would obviously be rude/a breach of contract for you guys most likely, but are you guys able to live off of tour income in between tours or do you have jobs back at home? I know the big bands like MMF, BMTH, etc can live off their income pretty well, but I'm more curious what it's like for mid-level bands like you guys. "

"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","are you 100% happy with your latest record? If not, what's one major change you'd like to make?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","I absolutely love it, I'm sure there's things that we could've made differently, but I love how it turned out and wouldn't change it -Aaron"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","By far my favorite album we've written as a band -Shawn "
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","I think we'd all say we're more satisfied with Life Reaper than any album we've put out, but there are some things I'd change. I wish the message of the songs was clearer, some of the choruses were a little different, and I wish the record in general was more dynamic. But that's what the best album's for!

Conor"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","When do you reckon you make your way back to Australia? It was rad seeing you guys here in 2013 :)"

Conor"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","what are some of your biggest influences? has that changed much since your first album?

also, who came up with the band's name and what exactly does it mean?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Some of my biggest influences (bands) would definitely be Foo Fighters, August Burns Red, Slipknot, Deftones and many more. (musicians) Dave Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, Matt Greiner, Adam Gray, Chris Coleman and Benny Greb -Aaron"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","It's cool to see so many metalcore bands with Deftones influences. "
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","What's the weirdest thing to happen to you guys on tour?"

"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Hey guys, big fan here after I saw you at Warped for the first time. What venue would you consider your holy grail to play at? (Even if you haven't played there yet) 
Also, if each of you could be any animal, what would it be and why is it a penguin?
Penguins are cool."
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","We played Blossom Music Center in Ohio and that was certainly a fantastic experience because I remember watching a lot of my favorite bands perform there when I was younger. 

As much as I love penguins, I believe my spirit animal would definitely have to be an elephant hahahah

"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","The first i ever heard of you was on the ABR and Texas in July tour. (Silverstein sucked, sorry) Iv been dying to see you guys again, and you're coming back to boise. So thanks! I'm so stoked."
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Thanks Travis! We're pumped to see you there"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Shawn- were do you buy your show jackets from? I need them in my life!!"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Thats a secret for now :) I'm gonna be working w a company to create jackets that we can sell in the future though!"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","If you are serious on this, I would buy every jacket put out!
Can't even give me a little hint at all?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Who are your biggest influences as musicians?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Dave Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, Matt Greiner, Adam Gray, Chris Coleman and Benny Greb! -Aaron"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Favorite city to play in?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Personally, Los Angeles, CA because I love visiting Griffith Observatory -Aaron"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Hmmmm St Petersburg in Russia was incredible. In the U.S. I'll say Springfield, VA is definitely one of them as it is like a hometown crowd

Conor"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","From Springfield, VA. We love when ITB comes around!"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","When are we going to get some new music from you guys?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","If you couldn't be a metalcore band, what genre would you choose? "
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","My go to music for late night drives is this psytrance group called Infected Mushroom, so I could see myself being a DJ playing some crazy forest raves 

- Kyle"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Electro pop ala 30 seconds to Mars or atmospheric rock/metal ala deftones

Conor"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Hip Hop/Funk/Pop music for sure -Aaron"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Hey, ITB! How have band practices changed after replacing so many members?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","We all live in different parts of the country so we have 1 rehearsal before tour. -Shawn"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Wow that is impressive. How common do you see this in other bands you've all toured with? Also, what are your experiences between playing with best friends you've grown up with compared to playing with dudes from all around the country?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","What's it like touring with ABR and Silverstein? I remember first seeing y'all at that tour back in 2012!"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","What is the process like for getting tours together/scheduling dates and venues for shows?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","We get offers from other bands or plan them with our manager/agent/label

Conor"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","What's song is your guilty pleasure?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Birthday by Katy Perry, because I'm pretty sure she wrote that song for me -Aaron"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","What is your favourite and least favourite part about touring?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Favorite: new experiences always, being able to meet so many different and amazing people

Least favorite: having vehicle problems

Conor"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Will I get to see you guys in Europe any time soon?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","We were just there!! Hopefully we'll be back soon

Conor"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Damn it, I just found out about you guys a few days ago. Looking forward :)"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Favorite piece of ink y'all have?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","My solar system half sleeve -Aaron"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Do any of you guys ever get a little bummed out when you are playing a small show and the crowd is absolutely dead? "
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Not really! You'll have those shows, it's a part of being in a touring band. Some cities are great, some not so great. We're still playing our music and showing our passion to others, regardless the size of the crowd -Aaron"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Not as long as the kids that are there are excited! Those shows can be a blast. Every band experiences it or has at one point, so it's best to make the best of it."
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","I started listening to you guys a few months ago and haven't stopped since. What do you guys like to do in your free time on tour? "
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","We love hanging out with the other bands, trying food from everywhere, and wasting time on our phones

Conor"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","For sure. hope to see you guys soon.

Thanks!"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Yo guys!

I had the pleasure of seeing you dudes at warped tour (PNC, NJ) and me and my girlfriend somehow got lucky enough to snag some VIP passes for your set thru a vendor. You guys killed it, and Shawn was super cool! 

I have a couple of questions for you guys- 

- What do you guys like to do in your leisure time on tour, if there is any?

- Do you guys have a favorite song to play together live?

And for Shawn-

- How do you expect things to change when the baby comes around? (Congrats, dude!)"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Thanks so much! I personally spend far too much time eating and playing games on my phone. I also enjoy reading.

My favorite songs to play live are Life:Reaper, Swine:Cult, and Shape:Shifter

"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","2 weeks 😂

Conor"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Do you guys plan to play warped tour again in the future?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","I sure hope so!! Warped Tour was a blast -Aaron"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","We'd love to and I'm sure we will as long as the demand is there 😉

Conor"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","How to you guys actually create a song? I've always been fascinated by the process. Do you just start off with a guitar riff and work from there? Thanks so much, love everything you guys do!"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Generally yes - we'll start with a main riff and build around it. In the future Id like to start by writing choruses first

- Conor"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Kyle,what kind of advice would you give a fellow guitarist who feels stagnant in his playing? What is your way of always progressing and bettering your playing?"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Hey ITB, going back to the old school, what was it like recording with that faggot Durv? 
Kidding. Not a serious question.

Best studio story? I still think the singing ruled on the first album. 
Thanks ITb"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Hahaha we love Durv! He's the man!"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Just wanted to drop by and say congrats on the baby Shawn! Hopefully can see you around ocean city md this year"
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","I love you guys and your music. That is all."
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Might seem like a dick question, but when I the Breather ceases to be, what are your backup plans for the rest of your lives? Will you guys stay involved in music in some way, or get regular jackoff jobs? 

Personally hoping you guys continue to pursue music long after Breather has run its course. "
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","I'll always pursue music. I also look forward to owning businesses of my own

"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","Whenever bands do AMAs here, they usually make the post a few hours before they actually answer questions so that there can be a decent number of questions and the best quality ones can be voted to the top."
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","^

I told them to post it early to gather questions/let the best questions bubble up to the top via the upvote and downvote system."
"We are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!","They're probably taking the ""wait for people to ask a million questions, then answer them all at once"" approach. Which ain't the best, but I'll take what I can get I guess."

"Vocalists, I need your help!","I want to get into recording my vocals, what is the best recording microphone and easiest software I can use. Thanks in advance!"
"Vocalists, I need your help!","Would also like to know. Also how does the compression work? I hear it makes it sound better."
"Vocalists, I need your help!","For a microphone, I'd recommend the Shure SM7B and software wise I would definitely recommend [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/). I absolutely LOVE that program."
"Vocalists, I need your help!","It all depends on your budget. How much will you pay for a good mic and software?

For starters, i think the easiest way you could go about it is with a Shure SM57 microphone. And the simple software Audacity. The SM57 is all right for recording vocals! It can record other instruments too. You're probably going to need a soundcard, i don't know much about soundcards. But i have the [Lexicon Alpha] (http://lexiconpro.com/en/products/alpha) and it does me justice.

That is probably the easiest kit you could go with. But if you want something even better then you have to get something a bit more pricey. "
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","**August Burns Red**

**Blessthefall**

**The Word Alive**

**Motionless In White**

**Oceans Ate Alaska**

Other possible bands: Chunk! No, Captain Chunk!, Get Scared, The Color Morale

Ice Nine Kills may also work because Outerloop is basically Fearless.

If anyone from Fearless reads this, you know what you must do. This tour must also come to Richmond VA."
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","Way to many headliners for that to be a thing. I could see a co-headliner with a mix of two ABR/BTF/MIW with two other bands though. "
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","Look up the Break Down The Walls tour from last year"
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","The All-Stars tour is another example of how a tour can work with a ton of big name bands"
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","That tour was so awesome."
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","There have been plenty of tours that have many big name bands. It just narrows down the types of venues the tour can hit.

Considering all of the bands are on one label, it would make it all much simpler as well"
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","I could see that being a thing"
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","I hope so. The 2011 Fearless Friends tour was a ton of fun. BTF, TWA, and MIW weren't as much on the metalcore side of things as they are today, and it also had chunk and tonight alive, but damn it was a fantastic show.

With those same bands taking a heavier sound, ABR getting signed, and new albums coming from ABR, BTF, Chunk, and recent release Oceans, the tour seems like a no brainer.

Almost every band would have an upcoming or recently released album"
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","Plus I feel like ABR's going to have some great tours once their new album is released"
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","Definitely.

At the very least I want to see ABR and BTF release mind-blowingly awesome albums, then go on a tour together"
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","Agreed, so pretty much a repeat of 2013"
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","Basically. They're really close friends and when they tour together its always a fantastic show"
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","I wouldn't be totally surprised to see PTV headline something like that as another possibility. "
"My proposal for a 2015 Fearless Friends Tour","Definitely. For a nonmetal-core focused lineup, I would love to see something like:

Pierce the Veil

Does anyone know of anyone or anywhere that has a physical copy of Adestria's Oh The Places You Go EP for sale. I have someone willing to pay a large amount of money for it. If you can't help thank you anyway!"
"Adestria - Oh The Places You'll Go EP","I'm assuming you already did this, but scavenge all the band merch sites, amazon, ebay, etc... I was at the show that they released the EP at, although I'm not even certain that they made many copies after then. "
"Adestria - Oh The Places You'll Go EP","They only made 100 copies, they all got sold at that show. im not the one looking for it, it's a guy I knows holy grail of physical cd's. Im just trying to find leads for him. Do you know anyone personally at that show who happened to buy one that night? This dude is ready to throw a lot of money for a copy "
"Adestria - Oh The Places You'll Go EP","I'm not gonna lie I did grab a copy when I was there, but I'm away at school right now and it's back at home somewhere. I knew a lot of the people at the show so I'm sure I know someone else who has one, it's been a minute though. 

/u/BackslashingfourthV mentioned a re-pressing? Maybe if your buddy hit them up on Facebook. You guys from SD? I used to fairly close with Adestria and sell tickets back before they got big, but lost touch once they started touring. "
"Adestria - Oh The Places You'll Go EP","My buddy is apparently friends with one of the members and none of the members have a copy and they dont plan on a repress. If you could get in contact with anyone from back in the day, or anyway for me to keep in contact with you for when you're back home from school. My friend is willing to drop up to 200 bucks for a copy. "
"Adestria - Oh The Places You'll Go EP","Oh shit you weren't kidding. 

I'll be back in SD around mid-march if that's not too long a wait, otherwise I'm not trippin. If you want I can PM my e-mail or #. "

Meanwhile I have one friends band who is starting out and can only get 1 show per month so I try to go to their's to support them."

"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","As someone who is entirely open minded when it comes to music, I am interested in what you enjoy listening to that isn't affiliated with the metal genre.

For example, one of my most favorite songs ever has to be [Breathturn by Hammock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rENnKECnfs)

What about you?"
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","Hip-Hop!"
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","Hip-Hop is probably my favorite genre behind metal/metalcore. What shit are you digging right now? I personally can't get enough of the new Joey Bada$$ project, got that coming in the mail. "
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","lovin stuff from Hilltop Hoods at the moment"
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","I really love classic punk and alt rock mostly just the bands in my local scene, just went to one of the greatest gigs of my life.

I also dig shoegaze and post hardcore and math rock and emo (proper emo)"
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","what shoegaze? Can I [blow your mind real quick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEqL3lIaZq0)?"
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","Fuck that was really good, a good chill thing to be listening at 3 in the morning, thank you a lot man.

And I'm not at all an expert on shoegaze sorry I mainly just listen to the entry level stuff like whirr, some my bloody vallentine, new title fight, Ride, Death of lovers ( i'm not sure if they classify but i really enjoy them) . I am subscribed to /r/shoegaze and i listen to songs every now and then from them and i like them ,just haven't got around to delving deep into the genre.

If you have more stuff like LSD and the search for god i'd love to hear it. but if you can't be bothered its totally understandable. "
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","[here ya go](https://kaironirse.bandcamp.com/album/ujubasajuba) it's the only thing I can remember off the top of my head...I'll keep you posted though!

EDIT: [SLOWDIVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0LIO138Z-A) is essential listening for anyone getting into shoegaze. One of my favorite bands of all time along with [Have a Nice Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FUMl2gAM7c) and [A Place to Bury Strangers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LcgO8YAxZI)"
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","Sorry about the late I just listened to these all, and thank you dude. You have a sick taste in music, I first thought slowdove was amazing in its light way then I heard have a nice life and it was so good, It slightly reminded me of Amenra whom I love.

Thanks again, curious do you have a Spotify account? As I could imagine you'd have some good playlists"
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","I didn't know they had Spotify in Australia...I actually don't really use it all that often but if you have a last.fm hit me up in PM and let's talk"
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","Title Fight just put out a pretty shoe-gazy album. "
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","yeah I don't LOVE it...still too pop-punky for me. Interesting direction though"

"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","I've been listening to the Title Fight's new album a lot lately, I'm not sure what genre that is"
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","It's a great one. It's like a cross between shoegaze, punk, and emo. "
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","I'm going to separate punk from metal entirely when I answer this question.

I listen to a lot of pop punk, hip-hop/rap, screamo/skramz, emotive hardcore, alternative, electronic, etc."
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","Any genre other than country, [MrSuicideSheep](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrSuicideSheep) has a lot of good music if you're into chill music et cetera"
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","I also listen to some radio pop (only single songs from artists, not whole albums), stuff like Billy Talent, Fall Out Boy, some electronic, some hip-hop, post-grunge (Breaking Benjamin!). Mostly different kinds of metal though."
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","Post-Rock"
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","The youtube channel 'Liquicity' has some pretty awesome music."

"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","I love calireggae.  Bands like Rebelution, Tribal Seeds, and Backbeat Soundsystem always put me in a great mood.  It is pretty funny to see people react when I tell them I mainly listen to metal and reggae because they are pretty much opposites when it comes to overall feel.  "
"Aside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?","Trap music is sick."

"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","FUCK YES"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","HYPE TRAIN, CHOO CHOO!"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Well, seems like I was right about it being a new album"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Well I definitely wasn't expecting a whole new album. So keen to hear it!"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","So is all Northlane having to do with it is Marcus doing a guest spot??Still more to come hopefully..."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","tracklist says Marcus is featured on one of the songs!"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Was really hoping for Northlane/IHW Split! But still so keen!"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","I hope the cleans aren't as bad as the last album. That's what really kept me from fully enjoying it."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Skydancer and Earthwalker were both recorded in a single recording session with the same producer (/u/randomawesome aka Josh Schroeder), so I imagine the cleans will be the same. I thought they were pretty good on Earthwalker to be honest."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","You got it. "
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","I'm really curious to know how the decision to do a two-part/double-album was made!

When In Hearts Wake came to record with you, did they already have this all planned out and then recorded the songs for both albums and just kept the ones from Skydancer under wraps until now? Or did they come in with the intention of recording a single album, then realised they had enough good songs to turn it into this concept with two separate but connected albums?"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","The idea was thrown around when they got here.  They had 14 or 16 songs ready, and I loved the idea of doing two records, but we only had 6 or 7 weeks... so i was like ""fuck it, let's do this!""  We wrote the rest of the songs in studio and although it was a pretty grueling process, it was a lot of fun.  They're one of the hardest working bands I've ever produced, so it was a game of keep up, haha."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Very cool! You did an amazing job on Earthwalker, it's one of my favourite albums so I can't wait to hear Skydancer! Between the two albums, which one is your personal favourite?"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Thanks man!  I actually prefer Skydancer.  I remember when we were dividing the songs up between the two albums, I expressed concern to them that they were saving all the great tracks for the 2nd record!  No joke."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Now I'm interested in seeing where it goes! P.S just found the hidden lyrics in the back of the Earthwalker case"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","There's a shot of Nick Hipa in the documentary. Ws he just helping/hanging out or did they feature him playing guitar on a song? Cause that would be dope as fuck. "
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","He's got a guest solo, and he reminds us all who the mayor of Shred City is."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","And another thing I'm curious about, was the message hidden in Northlane's Singularity (referenced [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/2wv6jb/secret_booklets_in_northlane_and_in_hearts_wake/)) connected with the Earthwalker/Skydancer project?

If so, was Marcus Bridge's part on the song Intrepid recorded recently and then added to the song that was recorded at your studio with In Hearts Wake a while ago?"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Yeah, his part was recorded right around the time ""Rot"" came out.  I'm not familiar with what Northlane put in their album art... I don't think it's connected to IHW."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Was the part that Marcus did originally going to be done by Adrian (or someone else)? I'm stoked to hear that song as Marcus is ridiculously talented, but I'm pretty sure the recording of Earthwalker/Skydancer was before the whole Northlane audition process that made Marcus more known."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","I hope so too. I really am not a fan of the cleans they have."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","I can't wait!"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","So hyped for this"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Awesome! Wasn't expecting that."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","I had always wondered about the significance of the original Skydancer single (not the one with Vigil) in relation to the Earthwalker album, now it all makes sense."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Please let it be more divination and less earthwalker"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","I think it would be so cool if the albums following Skydancer followed the same kind of format. Earthwalker, Skydancer, Firebreather?, Waterdrifter?, Buttsniffer?"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Stealthpooper"
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","I can't wait for this to come out but has everyone seen the album cover? It looks straight cheesy..."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","I like it, it's a direct representation of the concept of this album.

Earthwalker was about the ""feminine world"" or ""Mother Earth"" so it featured a female face as part of the earth. Skydancer is about the ""masculine world"" or ""Father Sky"" so it features a male face as part of the sky."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Well it's a continuation of the Earthwalker one so I can understand why it looks how it does. "
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","From the article posted above: ""Skydancer will be released 364 days before its predecessor and will share a multitude of themes with Earthwalker across the artwork, lyrics, and charitable intentions. The two will effectively serve as two individual parts to a completed whole."""
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","I'm confused, how will it be released 364 BEFORE its predecessor? That would make Skydancer its own predecessor O_o 

I think someone done goofed."
"In Hearts Wake announce new album ""Skydancer"" out May 1st","Yeah they meant ""after"" its predecessor, definitely."

"Any songs where there is screaming and cleans at the same time?","Technically they're melodic hardcore but their last album was much more metalcore based. They're pretty much in between both genres now.

^Don't ^kill ^me ^MWM "
"Any songs where there is screaming and cleans at the same time?","But isnt metalcore itself a genre in between two genres? That could be kinda confusing"
"Any songs where there is screaming and cleans at the same time?","Yes and it does get kind of confusing. But that doesn't mean the genre can't exist. Listen to The Ghost Inside's ""Returners"" album, that is much more hardcore based with more melody to it. There really isn't much metal influence in it. 

I guess its kind of splitting hairs after a while but the distinctions in their music is there. Regardless, the genres are really similar to the point that fans of one are also fans of the other. "

Actually they do this a lot in general"
"Any songs where there is screaming and cleans at the same time?","Issues has a bunch of songs like that, including Mad At Myself, Stingray Affliction, and stuff. Bands with two vocalists typically have stuff like that, like Oh, Sleeper, Silent Planet, Crown the Empire, etc."
"Any songs where there is screaming and cleans at the same time?","Care More by TDWP in the second verse"

[XXIX - I, of Helix](http://youtu.be/LaL5fOuyunI?t=6m2s), a little more subtle, but worth mentioning cause it's a kick ass song.

"Any songs where there is screaming and cleans at the same time?","Not really ""metalcore"", but Listening to Freddy Mercury by Emery does it. Emery does it a lot actually."
"Any songs where there is screaming and cleans at the same time?","my old band Tronwayne had a lot of that"
"Any songs where there is screaming and cleans at the same time?","I know this isn't metalcore but most of my friends that are into metalcore *really* appreciate Scar Symmetry's Holographic Universe album. It has a lot of heavy and light vocals at the same time, as well as complimentary vocals. 

Even though it's Melodic Metal, I highly suggest it! It's by far their best album, and although their new singers are improving drastically (I was personally disappointed with their latest album) Unseen Empire is awesome."
"Any songs where there is screaming and cleans at the same time?","Ice Nine Kills - Connect The Cuts, probably my favorite example of this"

"To all beartooth fans part 2.","So yesterday I added a post about bands similiar to BT, after checking all of them, heres what I actually found to be somewhat close:
**Of ice &amp; Men** (in terms of great vocalist),
**Stick to Your Guns** (in terms of overall style and great vocalist),
**Sylar** (Caleb's production so the overall style is pretty much similiar)
**Attack Attack** (Caleb was vocalist there so nothing suprising :))
**COME THE DAWN** (their Vocalist is pretty good and they have very many characteristics of BT imo)
**Crown The Empire** (same as last one)
**The Amity Affliction** (Not the closest one but still worth mentioning)
I know not everyone will find them similiar to BT cuz their style is somewhat unique, but still think it will make the searching easier:)"
"To all beartooth fans part 2.","While a lot of those bands are somewhat similar to their sound on Disgusting, if you're looking for bands more like how they sounded on the Sick EP, you'd be better off looking up bands like Every Time I Die, The Chariot, and letlive., or checking out /r/MelodicHardcore"
"To all beartooth fans part 2.","Sylar is fucking dope. Seen them live twice and those guys put on an amazing fucking show. Would recommend those guys to anybody."
"To all beartooth fans part 2.","I don't listen to them much, but damn, they're definitely great live"
"To all beartooth fans part 2.","I, too, like Of ice &amp; Men."

"To all beartooth fans part 2.","How is The Amity Affliction unique? I just saw them tonight and was bored a out of my mind. "
"To all beartooth fans part 2.","If this was OP's first time hearing these bands he listed, maybe cut him some slack because he probably just hasn't heard anything he thinks is similar to them yet."
"To all beartooth fans part 2.","Oh, I'm not trying to be a dick or anything. Was it started somewhere that it was his first time listening to them? "
"To all beartooth fans part 2.","Not directly, no, but OP was sharing the bands that got introduced to him in his last thread, so you would conclude that. That's cool – I guess I misread into your comment a bit haha."
"To all beartooth fans part 2.","They really are the epitome of a generic band. "
"To all beartooth fans part 2.","Well I made a mistake, mentioned in the eariel post, that english is not my native language. So to straight up everything i meant:
I know not everyone will find them (bands i mentioned) similiar to BT cuz their style is somewhat unique( BT style is unique), but still think it will make the searching easier:) - Sorry for mistake ;/"
"To all beartooth fans part 2.","Don't even worry about it dude. I was just genuinely confused. Thanks for clearing it up. "

"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","For me they strike the right balance between ""heavy"" and catchy. A perfect example would be [Self Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNhIw6Soa_4), [You Don't Bleed for Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE-B_naKelI), or [Reject Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9WGpbDp9U) and I haven't heard much do that.

It is pretty chaotic, almost as much as Calculating Infinity. 
"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","&gt; almost as much as calculating infinity

That is a big call, I'd say its a bit off but still chaotic as. You should listen to their burial plot bidding war ep you wouldn't know its ETID haha just wait till you get to eblorama and there is a cool as melodic part just before it."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Might be because when I think of Calculating Infinity my mind goes to [Clip the Apex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtbi9CHvikY) and [Destro's Secret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyyGnf9YlL0). "
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Those songs are still super chaotic haha just i find that more chaotic than ETID but don't get me wrong i live ETID and this is no competition just i think nothing will be more chaotic than calculating infinity "
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Oh, I thought you were saying it's a big call to say Dillinger is as chaotic as ETID. 

I know you listen to more mathcore/metallic hardcore type stuff so you probably hear a lot more chaotic stuff than I do. "
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Oh no vice versa haha so what would you rate hot damn out of 10?

Maybe some mathy grindcore is more chaotic but I'd still go calculating Infinity haha well each person is different y'know like if I want melodeath with cleans I'd message you straight away."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","&gt;rate hot damn out of 10?

Hard to give something a rating after a single, cursory listen. But, it would be a high 8. And by my rating scale, that's an A, almost an S. "
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","I'm not accustom to S but it is a pretty great album it's in my top three with From Parts Unknown and The Big Dirty"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Ah, S is a video game thing. Especially games like dance dance revolutions. It's the second highest score you can get, right behind SS (in this case that would be a perfect 5). "
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Oh okay thanks for clearing that up, I had a feeling it was a video game thing as I remembered this old shooting game (ninja assault I think) had an S rating and then a U too hahaha 

You've inspired me to listen to Hot Damn! Right now so thank you haha"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","&gt; Oh okay thanks for clearing that up, I had a feeling it was a video game thing as I remembered this old shooting game (ninja assault I think) had an S rating and then a U too hahaha

Never played ninja assault, but yep. It's a common video game thing. Sorry if I confueed you with it. If I didn't, I also apologize. 

&gt;You've inspired me to listen to Hot Damn! Right now so thank you haha

Haha, np. I'll probably relistn to it tomorrow myself. 
"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","I had it in my ps2 ahh the good old days, no problem bro I had a rough understanding ish.

Do re-listen, sorry about my positivity just feeling upbeat and man ETID are sick, like they have catchy southern stuff, chaotic mathcore and then just great semi mathcore/metalcore/hardcore"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","&gt;Do re-listen,

WIll do. It'll be the first thing I listen to when I wake up in the morning, maybe. Hopefully.

&gt;sorry about my positivity just feeling upbeat and man ETID are sick

No no no. Don't apologize for being upbeat haha. Hard to find that kind of mood, keep it if you've got it 

&gt;and man ETID are sick, like they have catchy southern stuff, chaotic mathcore and then just great semi mathcore/metalcore/hardcore

Definitely. I haven't heard anything bad from them. They're amazing. I like them almost as much as killswitch. They're on my [top 50](http://i.imgur.com/ki35daW.jpg) thingy. "
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","&gt; keep it up  

Unfortunately I need to sleep now and it's keeping me awake, but I still feel good at least, work is going to be harsh tomorrow , I will probably be asleep /trying to when you read this but could you link your last fm account so I can add you?

No Converge there mate :/"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","&gt;Unfortunately I need to sleep now and it's keeping me awake, but I still feel good at least, 

Well hey, at leas ya feel good, right? That's more than a lot can say. Hope you can sleep though. 

&gt;work is going to be harsh tomorrow

Dude I'm sorry to hear that, again I hope you get rest for that yeah? 

&gt;could you link your last fm account so I can add you?

Sure thing man, it's [right here](http://www.last.fm/user/Amethyst_Star). \\

&gt;No Converge there mate :/

Sorry about that,  I've only listened to Jane Doe. It's great though. I might actually put it on there, over something lesser. Thaw, Fault and Fracture, and Hell to Pay are fantastic. 

"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Yeah I was feeling good as I had some good father son time and drank a bit haha thanks for the concern and all! The work is just digging out a stream for a few hours, just tired as woke up heaps dyeing the night.

Well we had ""low"" music compatibility but that's algoods , we still share some if my favourite bands (my plays and scrobles are a bit mucked up as its only the music I had played on Itunes on my computer)

If you like Jane Doe by them, I think you would like almost everything else, maybe try their latest LP all we love we leave behind

Oh and listen to this cover from converge of [a cure song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qOae_p3r9YQ) to me this song is just amazing "
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Hah! Not fair bringing Dillinger into a discussion about chaos."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","I'll say that Ex-Lives is probably a little more rowdy than their other albums. I'm not a huge fan of their first EP and album, but I don't think I've ever heard an ETID song that I didn't like."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Oh yeah, forgot Ex Lives. Partying is Such Sweet Sorrow and Holy Book of Dilemma are great tracks. "
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","&gt; phenomenon

Do doo be-do-do"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Underoath "
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","It will always be Underoath. Spencer and Aaron were fucking beasts!"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Love underoath!"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","AILD = GOAT"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","As I Lay Dying. They're all ridiculously talented musicians and didn't release a single album that somebody can say is entirely bad. And then there's An Ocean Between Us which is easily one of the best metalcore albums ever."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","An Ocean Between Us is basically the definition of modern  metalcore. If not ACB then Shadows Are Security."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Converge, they are the most loved metalcore band on /r/metal and /r/hardcore but here hardly anyone likes them. They tale awhile to get into but then you can't get enough, one of my all time favourite bands in any genre."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Converge is a band that I didn't understand until I really started playing and writing my own music (""music""). Trying to be an actual musician totally changed how I listen to stuff."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Could I ask in what way? I've played guitar averagely for awhile and picked up vocals. What caught me was how they sounded like nothing I have ever heard before and it scared me a bit to be honest."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","I've been playing for about 15 years for perspective. I look at music like learning another language. I know a little Spanish, enough to understand and communicate basic stuff. I imagine this is approximate to how the general public understands music, so you get pop songs that sound alike because people who aren't musicians can only identify basic characteristics. They know if something is catchy, or if they can relate to a lyric or something.  Having a very basic understanding of a second language would, say, prevent me from having a conversation about the geopolitical implications of the existential philosophy of the European Union's involvement in the the Greek financial crisis in a language that isn't English. (Also not even in English. BS run-on sentence for effect.) The point is, the more fluent you are in a language, the better you can express and understand higher level conversations that would just sound like gibberish to someone else. 

Music is the same way, you can probably enjoy some Mozart without studying music, but you only realize he's a genius when you understand what he was doing. I listened to Korn and Nirvana when I picked up a guitar for the first time, but I got pretty bored with them when my musicianship improved because I could really start to hear what made Megadeth riffs so interesting. Once I got to the point where I could just play scales really fast I got bored with thrash and holy shit, have you ever heard of Rush? I'm still a casual Rush fan, but I feel they lack the sort of emotional/cathartic aspect of heavier music. So fast forward to bands like Converge, who can write something that I find to be musically interesting and still have the core elements that appeal to listeners of heavy music. Even the most highly educated Spanish speaking scholars still need to ask where the bathroom is on occasion.

I apologize if I undershot your question. This is more of a general answer than I think you were looking for."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","No this was perfect thank you for the answer it makes a lot of sense to me, I know a little bit of other languages like Latin and Spanish but the thing about the music makes so much sense, I'd say I'm a 2/10 at guitar and my problem is the songs I want to learn I'm not good enough but the stuff I can play i get bored with it.

I think my appreciation for music that delved from the path just began from hearing the same catchy thing over and over again and I began a love for songs that have no structure and that were more creative. Also I find drums in a lot of popular and actually most music to be boring and not really part of it and that's something I love. You did a great explanation, thank you.

I don't think I've seen you in the sub before but welcome if you are new!"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Thanks for the feedback. I've been a lurker for awhile. I don't post much in music threads because I can't honestly say that I'm a fan of any particular genre. I just cherry pick bands from all over the place. 

The only real guitar advice I can offer is to find a way to take lessons from someone that teaches theory. Some people are just talented and can invent magic by ear, but that's pretty rare. Having a basic framework will make a huge difference in your ability to create something that you'd enjoy playing."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Okay I will try to remember this, it sounds like good advice, I was going to get lessons at school but they gave it all to the younger students so I have to find tuition elsewhere. Will try to find a good instructor. 

Oh and in terms of bands if you like even just one band feel free to post here its a friendly sub and you seem to post in-depth informative replies "
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","As I Lay Dying (RIP)"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","There's a shitload of bands that i love, but for an absolute favorite, its a tie between Issues &amp; I See Stars.

Issues: While most might call it that generic Risecore band, they're honestly one of the most unique bands i've seen to date. It was abit sketchy when i first listened to it, but it grew on me &amp; it became one of my all time favorites. Its the small combinations of genres like RnB, EDM &amp; Metalcore that kinda made it work for me. While most see it as weird, it just goes together perfectly for me.

I See Stars: A close friend of mine intro'd me to this band via New Demons. And i've been hooked to it ever since. Listening to Murder Mitten for the first time &amp; going like ""Holy shit this sounds sick!"". Kinda like Issues, the mixture of EDM/Dubstep with that aggressive metalcore sound made it work for me. And they're the gateway band that intro'd me to bands that uses Synths &amp; stuff. From there I tracked back to their older albums, and they're all great too."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","[deleted]"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","well, considering i am /u/moshlyfe (or I was the last time I checked) the answer must be The Devil Wears Prada."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","My life was saved when I saw that they added more dates to the Zombies Tour."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Are they really you're favorite, or do you just go with it cause it's what everyone says. I know my favorite metalcore band changes time from time again, right now its The Amity Affliction, but who knows what it'll be next month?"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","You realize the reason everyone jokes about my TDWP jerking is because I started off by constantly jerking TDWP, right?"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","But do you still jerk TDWP?"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","I was told to tone it down"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","[deleted]"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","All That Remains always has a place in my heart, no matter how bad they get"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Attila, not sure why I listen to a lot of bands, but Attila just holds a spot for me."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Attila's licks aren't tasty enough"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","All That Remains. Even though they get shit on a lot for being pretty inconsistent and ""generic"" since The Fall of Ideals, something about the signature sound they create as a group really gets me. So no matter what they make, Phil's voice and Oli's guitar work will get me going.

Tied for second: Killswitch Engage and Trivium, with WtF A7X clinging on for a spot."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Crown the Empire they introduced me to this genre with The Fallout and even though a few songs of theirs I don't like they're always my go to choice when i'm on a long road trip and wanna listen to something."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Attila "
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Bury Tomorrow or In Hearts Wake "
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Although they started more in thrash, I have to go with Trivium."
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Probably Bring me the Horizon or Underoath. They're who got me into the genre "
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","[deleted]"
"What is your favorite metal core band of all time?","Can't decide between Hopesfall and Norma Jean..
They're rather hardcore though. I used to listen to songs made by a music mash-up team called ""The Legion of Doom"" (was looking up random RuneScape music videos and found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx-QlVsOvcM)) I really liked the remix of Hardcore and Post Hardcore songs which ultimatively got me into Metalcore. I then proceeded with TDWP, ABR, BMTH, Parkway Drive and all that generic stuff lol.

Other than that, I'm a diehard Erra fan since Andromeda EP


EDIT: Just realized I had like 5k Underoath scrobbles on my last.fm accounts, guess I found the winner"

"How do you listen to your music generally?","Just curious. I used to be a hardcore iTunes user, buying albums off the store and ripping CDs and all that, but lately I've just been using Spotify. Premium subscription is only 5 bucks a month for students, and it's just super convenient. I can find new stuff really easy, and I have access to basically everything I wanna listen to. 

EDIT: I too am no stranger to piracy. I do feel bad about it sometimes, but I do try to purchase albums legally if I really love the artist, and now that I've mainly switched to Spotify, I feel a bit better about it. I also go to LOT'S of shows, and I buy quite a bit of merch. But to each his own, and I'm glad that at least artists are getting known a lot easier, due to piracy. "
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I'll be honest,  I've downloaded over 90% of it probably, although I feel bad I am in college and if I paid for everything I'd be beyond broke. But that being said, I do still believe in supporting the artist,  so I have bought a couple shirts from my favorite artists. 

Edit:should have just clarified in regards to the actual question. Download them all and listen off my phone/computer"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I'm in the same boat. I try to go to shows and buy merch to support them as much as I can."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","For less than $10 a month you can have unlimited music through many platforms. You can't be *that* broke.

Edit: If you're interesting in skipping lunch once a month to afford a music service, I use Google Music and I think it's awesome. You can download the music to your device and listen when off wifi so no mobile data is used. Also, I've yet to find an album not on the service... I used to be an avid downloader and this is a complete game-changer."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I do like this idea, as I've always wanted a ""backup"" of sorts for the possibility of the day when my phone dies and I lose all my tunes, but absolutely don't want to use ""the cloud"" or anything. I typically listen when walking places (no car), or doing things that keep me busy (some involving no access to internet).

And while I do think I could afford it, I'm literally just pinching every penny I have until the summer where I have a job lined up. As is I'm only eating one meal a day, never eating out, and trying my best to stretch a couple hundred bucks for the next 4 months, while it is cheap, it is the result of paying for college myself and not being on student loans, which in itself, feels great!"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I also switched to google music recently and completely fell in love with the service. If anyone is interested in trying it out [this link](http://g.co/GoogleFriends) will get you a 3 month trial instead of the usual 1."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Spotify premium is love, Spotify premium is life."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Plus 50% for being a college student??? CHA-CHANG!"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I go to the magical *kingdom* where they play music and never have any *leaks* in their pipes. "
"How do you listen to your music generally?","shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Stream it if I can, download it if not. If I like it I'll buy a physical. "
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Torrent it and listen to it locally on my phone."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Download it, I use bandcamp when I can, or iTunes if what I want isn't on there. I use Spotify/Youtube to listen to something before I download it though and make sure I like it."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I love using Bandcamp when I can as well. Feels great knowing a bigger portion of the money is going directly to the artist. Also higher-quality downloads!"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Yeah! Bandcamp really is the only site where you can get FLACs as a download. Not like I'd need it - I usually download MP3 320 - but it's really neat."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Make purchases on vinyl. Buy the digital albums I actually really like and torrent/download the rest. Depends on how much money I have in my bank account."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","CDs, youtube, Spotify. I weirdly listen to so much music through youtube, just old habits"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","There's a web app called streamus that you can use to listen to music on YouTube while you browse the web. It's a lot better than just having a tab open because you can create playlists and save them and stuff. Highly recommend it."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Streamus thanks shall check it out when I go on the computer."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I mostly listen to stuff on Spotify, but I often just pirate music if I want to listen to it on my phone."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Download leaks to listen to until it releases on Spotify. Don't hate."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I occasionally still go on YouTube video journeys just clicking suggested video after suggested video, found some great bands this way. I also used to just look up ""top breakdown"" videos and find songs based off great breakdowns did anyone else do this? Haha"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","This is how I find new bands my self, (Most recently Struc/tures, fucking nutty) just plow through suggested videos. Then if I like them I'll buy an album, then repeat the process.

I used to do the whole Top Breakdown videos too, but I just stopped for whatever reason. :p"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Haha im not sure why I stopped either those breakdown videos can be awesome, I might have too check some out again now"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I found Parkway Drive on one of those ""Top 10 Post-Hardcore Bands"" in like.. 2008 or 2009. Of course, I knew better than to call them Post-Hardcore. And fuck, Smoke Em If You Got Em is still one of my favorite Parkway songs."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","This is how I found them too!! Romance is dead was on like 75% of top breakdown videos back then haha"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Parkway is just all around amazing!"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I purchase most of mine on CDs or vinyl.  Sometimes I use Spotify."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I still use the Zune Marketplace.  $10 a month for unlimited downloads. The only thing is you can only listen to music on your computer or a Zune."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I buy the cd and never use them and they just sit in a corner. Since I bought the cd I morally justify my piracy and then precede to download them all in FLAC and enjoy not having stupid proprietary restrictions :) And the cds are useful in the rare instance I use a car without an Aux lead or bluetooth or usb"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Itunes"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I buy digital on itunes or amazon mp3. My vinyls are just wall decorations made of albums I really like."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","iTunes + vinyl"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I always use iTunes. If I don't spend money on an album I never enjoy it as much because it has no value attached. When I spend money on it, I guess my brain feels like it must have some quality to it. "
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Normally just listen to it on Spotify (I don't have premium unfortunately). If there's an album that I really want I'll usually get it on iTunes and sometimes (very rarely) I'll buy physical copies of albums if I really want to listen to them on car trips, the most recent being Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega by Periphery."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I used to use itunes then I became broke paying for music.  So I started downloading on the pirate bay.  I switched from that to purchasing through amazon so I can have the physical album and auto rip.  I also use basic spotify when I don't want to pay for an album.  I purchased Periphery Juggernaut yesterday."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I buy my CDs through amazon usually as well, I love being able to download it in the future if I don't have my physical copy.

And I didn't care for Juggernaut honestly, but I will be buying their self-titled album probably next week. :)"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Yeah I love the auto rip feature especially waiting for my album in the mail.  I just got into Periphery is why I love the new album!"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I can't justify spending so much money purchasing music, especially as a student, and last time I attempted to use Spotify the library was noticeably bare, on several occasions I was simply unable to listen to the music I wanted to listen to because it was not present on Spotify. Not a fan of the ads or the fact you can't listen to high quality music without a subscription.

Justify it through the purchase of merchandise and seeing bands live, additionally it does more for the band than purchasing physical albums according to figures I've seen. Circulation of their music, so fans hear the music and come to shows/buy merch is more important to bands than record sales."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I will track future album releases for bands I like then usually torrent upon release. If I like the album, then I'll go ahead and purchase it, if not, I won't buy it. As a student, I can't justify spending money on every album, regardless if I like it or not. I'll find ways to support the bands I like (through band websites, merch), but record labels with outdated business models who I know wont be giving much of my money to the artist have earned no sympathy from me. 

Tl;Dr: I try my best to support the bands directly, while avoiding paying record labels with business models built for the 20th century."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Foobar2000 as my player and I pirate most of my music and buy things from smaller bands or things I really like. 

You people using iTunes disgust me...."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I used to use Winamp for a while to organize my music on my computer, but I just found it more convenient in the past year and half or so to just use iTunes, because of iPhone compatibility. 

iTunes isn't horrible IMO, but definitely far from the best."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I buy the album if it's one of my favorite bands, and for the rest I just download it."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Google Music is freaking amazing. Tried Spotify, and it makes shit radios and the layout is sloppy. Google has had my $7.99 for a while now. "
"How do you listen to your music generally?","[deleted]"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I listen to things on google play albums at a time"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Google Music... hands down the best subscription-based service I've ever subscribed to."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Pandora.  I pay for it so I can skip several songs on my stations if I don't like to hear them.  My Dethklok, BTBAM, and Zao stations get the most play."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I download leaks and listen to them in MediaMonkey, plus I pay for Google Play Music, so once albums release I just listen on there."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I used to download like crazy. I'd spend hours downloading albums, then organizing them properly, then putting them into itunes. Then I got a spotify account and I stopped downloading after that. "
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Google Play Music All Access

I find Google Play to be more robust than Spotify.  The library for their ""All Access"" paid subscription has rarely felt limited to me; right on par with Spotify.  You can host your mp3s in the cloud using Google Play, so songs you have downloaded as mp3 will seamlessly integrate into the rest of your All Access library when you upload them.  The mp3 locker feature caused me to jump ship from Spotify and I'm not looking back"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I love Google Play. I pay for an account for myself, and my girlfriend. The fact that I can add any music on the play store, to my library with a click of a button is fantastic. I also love how easy it is to access on other devices, especially when I am able to sign in to chrome and have it load all my settings. Not only that, but being able to jump to the music video for the song is awesome. I was hesitant about paying for it, when Pandora is free, but I have not regretted my decision in the slightest, nor the decision to get my girlfriend an account, since I signed up. "
"How do you listen to your music generally?","CDs all the way for me! That are of course put onto my computer, and then my phone/Ipod. 

I'm liking this spotify idea though..."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Torrent the majority of it (I buy some cd's occasionally) in a lossless format if possible and listen on my computer/phone/car. "
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Mostly spotify. It still annoys me so much that I can't get Chasing Rainbows on there"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Are you me?"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","Piracy. Why would I buy music when I can get it for free? I support my artists by going to concerts and buying merch. And buying a song off of iTunes hardly even helps the artist, iTunes keeps most of the dollar you spent on the song."
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I press play"
"How do you listen to your music generally?","I love Spotify on my desktop, but I am a completionist and love to say that I bought that  album. I also enjoy having all my music with me without using cellular.  Pirating music is different from pirating movies. I generally watch a movie once or twice. However, I listen to a song hundreds or thousands of times. I am morally opposed to pirating music."

"Miss May I - Monument","I'm one of the few people on this sub that also likes their new stuff, but their old stuff's great, if you like this, you'll probably enjoy the whole Monument album, and maybe their album Apologies are For the Weak"

"Erra - Crimson","Believe it or not my favorite has become Dreamcatcher. It's such a perfect song, and Jesse absolutely kills it with the chorus.

Close second is Alpha Seed."
"Erra - Crimson","The intro to Alpha Seed is probably my favourite intro to any song ever."
"Erra - Crimson","i feel that jesse's cleans have progressed immensely because of ghost atlas, and that's why moments of clarity has such great cleans.  i do greatly miss garrison's highs and alan's melodic guitar parts"
"Erra - Crimson","For some reason I was honestly worried that Jesse's vocals would suffer, or at least that he wouldn't sing as high as he had on Augment and before. But thankfully that was laid to rest when I heard Dreamcatcher."

"Erra - Crimson","that's because they don't have any bad songs"
"Erra - Crimson","I'd actually have to say my favorite is Ultraviolet. Garrison just kills it in that song."

I think there may have been 1-2 shows over the past year but I wasn't able to make them.

Richmond used to be a set stop for almost every tour on the east coast, now most tours hit NC, VA beach, and then either springfield or somewhere in maryland"

Edit: Ice Nine Kills could also be in there somewhere, as Outerloop is basically Fearless"
"The Word Alive and Chelsea Grin announce a co-headliner with support from Like Moths to Flames and Sylar!!","ABR was actually here with Blessthefall, Northlane, and Defeater last winter at the National but I missed it because of... you guessed it, finals.

"Which should be the first single released by a band?","So, when a band is promoting their new album, which do you think should be the first single? If the first song released is the best one on the album, we may end up disappointed when the album comes out. If they release one of the worst songs first, we may get a surprise when listening to the whole thing but we also may not be as eager to buy the album... Or should they just release the most accessible song if their goal is to expand their fanbase?

I know different bands may have different goals, but is there a pattern here? Also, if you could give examples with your answers, that would be fantastic and interesting to read."
"Which should be the first single released by a band?","The one that best represents the direction/theme of the album"
"Which should be the first single released by a band?","If a band has already decided that there's a ""best"" or ""worst"" song before the album has even come out, then they probably haven't made a very good album. I can understand that many bands will be more critical of their work post-release, a few months or years down the track, but pre-release they should be proud of every track on that album, and for that reason I don't think they would consciously choose a ""best"" or ""worst"" song to release as the first single.

Accessibility and catchiness are probably two pretty important factors - if your first listen of a band is one you enjoy and remember then you'll be more likely to follow the band in anticipation of future singles and, ultimately, pick up the new album. Mission accomplished. This doesn't need to be the best song on the album, but one that is memorable. Take Beartooth's first single ""I Have A Problem"", for example; the repeated lyrics in the introduction highlight Caleb's harsh vocals (the selling point of the whole project) and grab your attention, while the end of the track features repetition of the ""I have a problem"" lyric. Repetition is a pretty sure-fire way to get fans engaged and learning the lyrics. This is particularly useful when bands do a string of shows before the albums release - catchy lyrics are more engaging, allow fans to become more involved in the live experience, and will leave a longlasting impression on them long after the show has ended, eventually leading many fans to preorder the new release, or at least pick it up shortly after release."
"Which should be the first single released by a band?","neither, release the title track, if there is no title track, release the one you think is the most likely to cause talk "
"Which should be the first single released by a band?","I'd say release the most representative track first, and then the most non-conventional track second. That way there's a distinct contrast in the flavours of the album."
"Which should be the first single released by a band?","The song most likely to get the attention of their intended audience. Not the radio friendly catchy song, but the one that gets the hardcore fans' attention.

Most of the time it's the radio friendly single released first though and we all roll our eyes because we know that's exactly what it is, and (hopefully) the rest of the album is what we actually want."
"Which should be the first single released by a band?","My band and I released our song with the catchiest chorus and it also had a feature."
"Which should be the first single released by a band?","That's what I would have done. Release the one you think will appeal to the most people. And a feature cant hurt."

"Looking to get into some new bands","So, as far as metalcore-type music goes, I love stuff like Asking Alexandria, The Amity Affliction, Trivium, Periphery, Crown the Empire, etc. Also notable, I enjoy listening to thrash metal (Megadeth, Metallica, etc.) as well as some post-hardcore (Falling in Reverse, Pierce the Veil). I'm looking to get into some new bands in the genre, or in similar styles.

"Architects - 'These Colours Don't Run'","See, this is where I'm having a hard time with this music scene the past five years.

Focused on heavy buildup/breakdown type stuff since that's what makes the ""fucking pigs"" part of this song so good. Ranges into hardcore/moshcore/deathcore/djent territory, but mostly still pretty metalcore rooted. Enjoy!

"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","I play guitar and JB Brubaker of ABR has been a huge influence in my playing. I recently picked up drums too, and Oceans Ate Alaska's stuff is what makes me strive to get to a level where I can play technical stuff well. So how about you guys?"
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","I've been playing for like 5 or six years i guess. I started because of Disturbed, but really it was Avenged Sevenfold that made me want to get better at guitar. I'm not sure when it was that I started liking metalcore, but I think it was Unholy Confessions and Second Heartbeat off Waking the Fallen. From there I got into stuff like War of Ages, and then Of Mice &amp; Men, Asking Alexandria, Alesana, Bring me the Horizon, and so on/"
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","Ahh, good ol' Disturbed. I feel like they are a gateway band to harder music, and still one of my favorite bands. I started off playing a lot of their stuff as well. I'm pretty sure Ten Thousand Fists was the first physical copy of an album I purchased with my own money."
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","Yeah, Indestructible is what got me into metal. I rarely listen to them now. They're like one of the only bands I've been huge into but couldn't give a shit about now. "
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","I've been playing guitar for eight years.  I've been screaming for three.  I've been singing for one.  

John Frusciante and Jimi Hendrix are my guitar idols.  They both make me cream.  

I want to scream with the versatility and endurance that Ian from Rings of Saturn has.

I want to sing like Jesse Cash or that dude from TesseracT. 

Practice makes perfect, kiddos."
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","I'm starting screaming too and the guys in Rings Of Saturn and Angelmaker are making me so motivated."
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","Ashe or Dan from TesseracT? "
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","Yes.

I don't know.  Both. "
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","Good choice. "
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","I've been screaming for about three years now, and at first I was mostly influenced by bands like Motionless in White and Chelsea Grin, but when I got into August Burns Red in early 2013, Jake's vocals really inspired me to take it a lot more seriously, and practicing screaming ABR songs has really helped my vocals get a lot better over time"
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","Jakes vocals are really awesome to scream along with. "
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","They definitely are"
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","I started playing guitar ages ago and then stopped, but when I picked up last year La Dispute influenced me too, though now Kurt Ballou is influencing me more (but not up to skill)

Screaming was the same, but right now Jacob Bannon and all the members of Code Orange are influencing my style.

Though with screaming I've been thinking about trying to do amenra's thing or dillinger/ etid style "
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","Being playing guitar for about 6-7 years, I'm only 17 - Metallica (thanks to their Guitar Hero title) got me into guitar. Bullet For My Valentine are the ones who converted me over to the ""hardcore"" / ""metalcore"" genres."
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","The one who inspired my to pick up the the guitar was Tom Morello. The man came out with so many amazing riffs in both Rage and Audioslave. But once I started listening to metalcore, Chris Rubey was a huge inspiration. The Devil Wears Prada has so man earth shattering riffs like Born To Lose but then you get some sweet leads like Assistant to the Regional Manager.  Chris is just a really talented guitarist."
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","Chris Rubey is huge to me too, the earlier stuff is simplistic yet awesome. "
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","I started screaming my freshman year of high school, and I'm a senior now so that's almost 4 full years. I was inspired by Mike Hranica and Austin Carlile, and I feel my style blends Austin Carlile's highs (on the OM&amp;M self titled) with Mike Hranica's lows (on Zombie/Dead Throne)"
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","I really like Austin's highs, if you ever put material out or join a band I would love to hear how it sounds :)"
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","&lt;3"
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","Started playing guitar about 8 years ago, was inspired to start playing by listening to metallica but within a year I was listening to metalcore starting with all that remains and atreyu."
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","Underoath made me like heavy music, so Underoath.  

But Metallica taught me EVERYTHING I needed to know to play metal guitar. "
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","Honestly, I was inspired by School of Rock when it came out. I know that sounds lame, but seeing Zack (don't know his real name) play the guitar like that at 11 made me realize I probably could too.

Metalcore-wise, As I Lay Dying, Parkway Drive, and August Burns Red have some of the coolest riffs, and I think I started playing those first. "
"To those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?","I started playing about 8 years ago but lost interest in it, but about Freshmen year I found A Day To Remember and I instantly began obsessing over them. Their simplistic formula and easy to do but awesome breakdowns made me pick up the guitar again. Every since then I've gotten a LOT better. "

"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","I went to the Frozen Flame show last night headlined by August Burns Red, but mostly there for Northlane and MMI. I tried crowd surfing for the first time during the MMI set, and in the front row, I was getting dropped. You could tell it was a matter of time before I went down, but I felt someone tugging on my arm. Looked up, and sure enough, it was Levi Benton. 

He grabbed my forearm and pulled me up onto the stage. In the middle of possibly their biggest hit (Relentless Chaos), he put his arm around my shoulder, looked at me, and said something along the lines of 'don't worry man, I gotchu' and kept going with the song after striking a pose with me and holding my fist up. 

The guitarist came towards me, shook my shoulder, and said something, wasn't sure what (it was too loud to hear him). After that, I jumped back into the pit. Pretty damn cool for my first time crowd surfing. After the show, Levi was hanging out beside the stage like he was the entire show rocking out to the other bands, and I was just walking out of the venue, didn't even notice him there.

He shouted out to me something like 'hey black and red shirt, come here man!'. I walked over there, and he asked if I was the one that nearly ate shit. I was like 'yeah, thanks for saving my ass'. We talked for a minute, asked if I had a good show, told him he rocked it, blah blah blah. He ended it with 'well I should get backstage to hit the road again. Good talkin' bud, can I count on seeing you at our next Edmonton show?' Of course I was like hell yeah, and he responded with 'awesome, we can always use some badass fans like you. Stay metal man' and walked away. Had to be the coolest, down to earth frontman I've ever met, best experience at a show of my life **by far.**

**TL;DR:** Levi Benton of MMI saved my ass in the pit and pulled me up to rock with 'em, then struck up a conversation with me after the show, forever securing my respect."
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","Yeah, he's a great dude, I talked to him for a bit after the Boston show, and got a similarly good impression"
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","It's like to him we're not just fans that pay his bills, we're just a couple of guys hanging out into the same shit. He doesn't act like he's the best at all when talking, just another guy into metal"
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","Exactly, definitely seemed like that to me too, plus he's been doing livestreams on Younow every sunday, and last time he pretty much announced early that they're playing Warped this year"
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","Fucking rad! "
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","I saw him at the show in Detroit doing the same sort of thing. I didn't talk to him but he was hanging at the side bar catching a few drinks chatting up a few people as well. I didn't approach him because I didn't want to be rude and interrupt but I got that same sort of vibe from him. Seems like such a cool guy and definitely doesn't have a huge ego like some of the guys in the scene do."
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","Levi is awesome. I interviewed him on Mayhem last summer, really down to earth guy. Looking forward to talking with him again next week! Put a smile on my face to read this story, always glad to hear about a great show experience."
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","One time on twitter I said that I think Levi needs his own wikipedia article and he was like ""me too"""
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","I remember meeting Levi years ago on the Back to the Roots tour with TDWP. He was super chill and we were just shooting the shit about random things. Glad he's still cool after they've gotten bigger!"
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","I visited with them after a really small show in my hometown. They actually came to Denny's with me and a couple buddies and we bullshitted the whole night. Theyre awesome dudes."
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","Podcasting with Levi on Tuesday. Maybe I'll bring this story up!"
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","I'd like to see if he remembers what happened actually"
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","He talked with me forever during a Vursa Limited signing at Warped a couple years ago. Great guy"
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","Levi is a great guy and always puts on a great show"
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","I was at the edmonton show as well. Not a big MMI fan, but they put on a hell of a show. 

During the ABR set, I was right near the front row headbanging away. I randomly looked to my left and I saw Levi right next to me jamming out with the rest of the crowd. I saw Jesse Cash too and he offered to lift me up to go crowd surfing. It's so awesome to see the supporting bands in the crowd, socializing with everyone else after their set is over."
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","He was to the left if stage by all the instruments for like half the show, he really loves his job man.

And shit , fit for a king ROCKED IT !!"
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","Yes fit for a king was incredible, no offense to Northlane but I thought FFAK deserved to go after them. "
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","That story made me smile. I should go to a show soon. Damn college and work. "
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","yep, levi's fucking awesome. I saw them 3 summers back at Warped Tour, and was crowdsurfing during their final song (i think it was Masses of a Dying Breed? not positive). As i got towards the front, i started falling, with just my legs on top of people and my torso pretty much hanging. After like 20 seconds, people started helping me back up, and i realized to my left was the stage, and to my right was Levi who apparently jumped into the crowd while i was falling. The song was almost over, but he had one last section to do vox for, so he yelled ""hey, stay right there!"" and rolled overtop of me to get back to the stage. As i made it to the front, we high-fived. 

Later in the day, I stopped by their merch booth to say hi, and he and I had a good laugh at it. "
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","I am so fucking choked this tour didn't come to Vancouver. They hit plenty of other western Canada cities (Calgary, Edmonton), but I guess scheduling just didn't work out. I love MMI, ABR and Erra immensely and being able to see them on the same bill would have been awesome (I would have driven to Seattle but, alas, other obligations). :("
"The Guys From 'Miss May I' Are Rad af.","Can confirm he is awesome. Years ago after they released their first album (not their EP) I saw him outside the venue unloading and asked him why they changed their song name from ""No Need to Whip a Dead Horse"" and he told me their recording studio or whatever didn't like it. Chatted with him for a minute as the line was moving, but it was a great impression and they kicked ass at the show."

I'm not talking about just screaming; I'm talking about M. Shadows-""City of Evil""-era-raspy or Chester Bennington-in-his-prime harsh. It's almost like they're screaming but they sing a melody at the same time. It's fucking awesome. If reference is needed, check out the [vocal isolated track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDJ1WpXIjY0) of Crawling.

"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","reach beyond the sun, a profound hatred of man, my heart bleeds the darkest blood, set your body ablaze "
"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","The amount of posts you make that include the words ""Converge"" and ""Code Orange"" are out of this world. Not complaining though, Nails is dope."
"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","Its because those bands are sick as hahaha do you like them? Also they are mainly the only metalcore bands I dig except for mathcore and oathbreaker haha"
"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","I love Code Orange, not really into Converge but I like them from time to time."
"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","Code Orange Kids actually got me into Converge  and were one of the first hardcore bands I liked so they are special to me and Converge were kind of the first metalcore band I liked, both in my top 5 artists."

"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","I 100% agree but I just figured the death card might be more approachable or at least known"
"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","All I can say is yes"
"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","Well, I would recommend ABR, but it seems like you're already familiar with them, I'd say stuff from Miss May I's first two albums, Monument and Apologies Are For the Weak. Also Fit For a King, and even though they're more along the lines of melodic hardcore, Defeater, especially the songs Bastards and Warm Blood Rush"
"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","I enjoy ABR too much for it to be my anger jams. The riffs are too fun haha. 
Love me some Miss May I, never listened to Apologies though... Will have to give it a listen. "
"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","&gt; never listened to Apologies though

Oh my god. I am so jealous of you right now. Enjoy."
"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","Ah, fair enough, I'd usually agree on ABR, but some songs like Poor Millionaire and Animals are great when I'm angry, also definitely check out Fit For a King, one of my favorite angry bands"
"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","Not metalcore, but when i'm pissed I give anything off Iowa by Slipknot a listen. People = Shit and Disasterpiece are both great for your particular mindset."
"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","I'll try it, but there's generally something about Slipknot that makes me unable to listen to them. Thanks."
"Super pissed off, what angry music you got?","Thats what I like to hear though, the open mindedness to try new things. Maybe in a different state of mind they will resonate with you, but if not thats cool too! Different strokes for different folks."

"Volumes - Wormholes","I've seen them live twice, but I was never actually into them until after. That makes me really mad."
"Volumes - Wormholes","I saw them at warped and they had so many backtracks but their vocalist was good and they put on a decent show."
"Volumes - Wormholes","Yeah dude, they're one of my most wanted bands to see sometime. From the live's I've seen yeah there's backtrack, but the vocals are fucking incredible, they accompany each other so well, and overall these dudes put on a great show. Though, yeah they should get a member or two to play the instrumentals right."
"Volumes - Wormholes","Diego and Raad are pretty talented at the guitar and bass, respectively. But most metalcore bands tend to have at least two guitarists, and Volumes has to make do with just one for live play. I've never had an issue with the backtracking, because I understand the reason, but I could see adding another guitarist being beneficial to live play. 

Regardless, Michael and Gus know how to fucking *move* during a set. So much energy at their shows!"
"Volumes - Wormholes","Can't agree more. One of the sickest sets I've ever seen."
"Volumes - Wormholes","Dude I saw them live once and they fucking sucked a bag of dicks. They were so fucking high from smoking up before the set that they couldn't even set up and once they finally did, they only had time to play 3 of there shittiest songs. Smh."

The small solo was pretty cool though :P I need to listen to the whole album, a lot of people are telling me this is the more generic song they have"

"
"Volumes - Wormholes","I'm with you. It's an amazing song."
"Volumes - Wormholes","when did music become about whether or not it's fucking technical?"
"Volumes - Wormholes","It's not that it's not technical the timings are pretty technical it's just that it's really boring. "
"Volumes - Wormholes","I didn't even get that far into it. It's hard to make screaming over heavy technical music seem boring, but this song did it."
"Volumes - Wormholes","That's what's so great about this genre though. There are some really technical bands you can get into if this band doesn't suit you. There are even technical bands like Tesseract (even though that's not really metalcore) that put out albums with no growls (see: Altered State). 

This band isn't trying to cram solos and sweeps into every verse. They're just fun and heavy, with moderately technical rhythms sprinkled throughout their albums. I love Volumes."

"August Burns Red - American Dream. 3:56 is the rawest yell... one of my all time favorites!","While I like this song, I definitely agree that those bands have rawer screams than this, I'd even say Beartooth does, especially on the songs from the Sick EP"

Like there'd be bands out there with rawer screams than them, just I don't know them its like when people say something is the most brutal haha"
"August Burns Red - American Dream. 3:56 is the rawest yell... one of my all time favorites!","Exactly, ABR is definitely my favorite band, but it doesn't make sense at all to say things like that about them, when there are so many other more ""raw"" sounding bands out there"
"August Burns Red - American Dream. 3:56 is the rawest yell... one of my all time favorites!","It doesn't matter about those tags like raw as it's not going to be the only thing you like, and raw doesn't mean good its all up to the individual, I love every time I die and they aren't raw at all or stuff that's just singing."

"Could someone tell me or link me to good info about properly balancing sound for a house show?","One important thing is to make sure the vocals are loud enough that the vocalist doesn't have to strain to be heard over everything, since that's a really good way to blow out your voice"
"Could someone tell me or link me to good info about properly balancing sound for a house show?","Simplest way is trusting your ears, if you have an EQ that allows you to adjust both the level and the frequency then turn the level all the way up and sweep the frequencies until you find the area that sounds the worst, then turn down the level to the negative side. Sort of a cheap trick but works pretty well especially when youre getting started. Cut more than you boost. Chill with the bass."

Also, does the production on this one bother anyone else? Sounds pretty muddled to me. "

"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","If you're gonna check that out, check out Hands Like Houses' acoustic EP ""reimagine"". Hell, just check out Hands Like Houses. They have some elements of metalcore, but definitely aren't ridiculously heavy. Also, no screams."
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","Also check out [Miss Fortune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWzp-n_nWXQ)
They hardly do screams these days.

[Destroy Rebuild Until God Saves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94VIJp4Q5xQ), pop-punky band by Craig Owens. If your brother's into the genre, he'll probably know who that is.

"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","Born of Osiris is pretty good, especially the newest album with all of the cool synth-y stuff

Edit: Or if you're looking for something softer, maybe stuff from the album Singularity by Northlane and their new song Rot, lots of cool melodic stuff, plus some nice bouncy riffs"

&gt; A Day To Remember - Another song about the weekend acoustic

&gt; A Day To Remember - Good Things

None of these songs are metalcore "
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","A Day to remember is generally referred to as a metalcore band."
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","Or a post-hardcore band or an easycore band. The fact is those aren't metalcore songs. They're pop punk and easycore/post-hardcore"
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","alright, my mistake, I'm sorry, I spend more time listening to music than focusing on sub genre"
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","Well, you asked for metalcore songs for parties, yet post non-metalcore songs. "
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","But you posted in a subgenre subreddit. /r/music is that way -----&gt;"
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","Yeah, and I'd get nothing "
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","Dunno why everyone is being a tool to you. Definitely add Downfall Of Us All by ADTR."
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","I do, because people in this subreddit are giant douches."
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","Idk, I just want music by metalcore bands without screams or breakdowns etc and used ADTR as an example..."
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","I see what kind of suggestions you want friend, but asking for metalcore songs without screams or breakdowns is like asking for water that isn't wet. Those are two defining of the factors in modern metalcore."
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","Yes it is, I've actually found a fair amount of songs so far from this thread though "

"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","I See Stars has some great party songs. "
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","End of the World Party? Anybody?"
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","The problem with finding downtempo/softer metalcore is that metalcore bands put their most somber/depressing lyrics into their softer material. If you want a softer sound for the party, but still have a metal sound, some of the lyric subject matter might not match a kickback vibe. Regardless, here's my best shot at fulfilling your request:

EDIT: [Dream Catcher Acoustic - Set It Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx-2n4SHepc)

Check those out and steer me in the right direction if it's not quite what you're looking for."
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","I completely agree with you, I'll check those out. He really likes Atreyu so that's a start.

Also, trying to push this point across, it doesn't necessarily have to be acoustic, just no screams or breakdowns. Use the songs I referenced in the OP as a basis."
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","If you're looking for stuff without screams or breakdowns, you're in the wrong place, if you want stuff like lighter ADTR, try /r/poppunkers"
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","Yes, but I'm looking for softer songs by metalcore bands that my brother likes."

Not Metalcore, but some great Post-Hardcore bands that have similar instrumentals will suffice. Bands like Slaves, Emarosa, Hands Like Houses, I the Mighty, and One Foot in the Grave by Jamies Elsewhere should be up your alley."

"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","Every Time I Die is pretty party worthy music."
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","Try more post hardcore music. Basically metalcore with an emphasis on singing over screaming. The illusionist by Jamie's elsewhere is good. Possibly even rise by a skylit drive, if he's into them."
"Metalcore that can be played at a party?","Palisades, they're like Top 40 pop with trap beats and some chuggy breakdowns, basically Issues-lite."

"Thoughts on nu-metalcore","Really not a fan of it

Edit: Don't mind Sylar too much though"
"Thoughts on nu-metalcore","most of the bands I grew up on were from the 90s wave of numetal, so if it's done right, I love the numetalcore movement, but I want something closer to the Mudvayne/Slipknot style of numetal, dont really care for the LimpBizkit/Linkin Park style"

"Thoughts on nu-metalcore","sworn in, barrier, gift giver"
"Thoughts on nu-metalcore","Oh OK. I always assumed they were more melodic hardcore but they do seem a bit different from the typical melodic hardcore band, more metaly. I can dig these bands though, really like barrier."
"Thoughts on nu-metalcore","Dangerkids, Cry Excess"
"Thoughts on nu-metalcore","Enjoy Dangerkids, My Ticket Home, Issues and Sylar

Not to fond on everything else.
Unsure how bands could go about making Slipknot nu-metal rather than Linkin Park nu-metal

Can't picture it"
"Thoughts on nu-metalcore","I like it a lot, the bands go hard, there's a good mix of different styles within that umbrella (Gift Giver to Dangerkids to My Ticket Home), it's something new, something good."
"Thoughts on nu-metalcore","I'm down. Always good to see bands expanding the genre."
"Thoughts on nu-metalcore","Honestly I'd rather hear a band try it than just make generic metalcore "
"Thoughts on nu-metalcore","I don't really care in all honesty. If it sounds great to me, I'll hear it. If it doesn't, I won't. My Ticket Home's 2nd album is full-on Nu-metalcore, but it sounds fucking great IMO."

"Which band got you into metalcore?","Mine is through exactly the same song - however, I checked them out when Bite My Tongue was released, so I was exposed to Chelsea Smile/Pray For Plagues rather than the comparatively less shocking Can You Feel My Heart. Loved it nonetheless."
"Which band got you into metalcore?","TDWP "
"Which band got you into metalcore?","Of Mice &amp; Men's self-titled record"
"Which band got you into metalcore?","Asking Alexandria. My friend took me to their concert (wouldn't take no for an answer) and I absolutely loved it. Saw I See Stars, Memphis May Fire, As I Lay Dying, and AA. The rest is history."
"Which band got you into metalcore?","I was in shitty punk bands in high school until we played a bunch of shows with The Gentleman Homicide (try bandcamp or Pandora) techy, melodic, spastic, they brought my interests into the world of heavy alternative metal."

"Which band got you into metalcore?","Shadows Fall, bruh. Those sweeps at the beginning of The Light That Blinds hooked me instantly. From there I got into Trivium, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Killswitch Engage, and Lamb of God all at once. I was simply blown away by all of it "
"Which band got you into metalcore?","Atreyu and underoath for sure. My dad used to listen to Atreyu so that's how I got into.

But where it all started was Tony Hawk Underground 2 for GameCube. That made me go from radio pop to punk music."

"Which band got you into metalcore?","Haste the Day, specifically the song When Everything Falls.  Oooooh that intro.

"Which band got you into metalcore?","I was a huge fan of Alesana in high school - eventually I found an Asking Alexandria song that featured Shawn Milke. So I guess for me it started with Alesana but the first metalcore band I was a fan of was Asking Alexandria and Elton John."

"Hey Everyone! I'm playing my first show on Friday.","First of all: have a great show!
I recommend knowing your music so well you could do it in your sleep. That way if nerves kick in, you'll know what you're doing.

"Hey Everyone! I'm playing my first show on Friday.","Haven't recorded yet, this show is kind of our debut.  We're a Chicago four-piece hardcore punk band.  So far, we've written enough for an EP, we just need to record.  It's hard to find time for that when we all have so much schoolwork all the time.  On friday, we'll be playing an original and a cover of Subliminal by Suicidal Tendencies.  We only have a two song set cause we're opening for plenty of other bands."
"Hey Everyone! I'm playing my first show on Friday.","Stay hydrated, dawg. 😎👍🙌👌🙏"
"Hey Everyone! I'm playing my first show on Friday.","I can only tell you, MOVE.

You're gonna be nervous, you're probably going to mess up a lot, but that all comes with the territory. But there's nothing worse than watching musicians perform and they're frozen. (Unless you're playing super complex shit) 

So just move around and have fun. You'll remember your first show for ever so don't over think it and just enjoy the moment. 

"
"Hey Everyone! I'm playing my first show on Friday.","Definitely go nuts, but nothing you're uncomfortable with. I sing for my band, and I used to be a statue on stage, so when i decided to move I overcompensated a little bit. Make sure you still have lung capacity for what you do, don't be afraid to play off of the crowd (or look at them) and have fun!!"
"Hey Everyone! I'm playing my first show on Friday.","Good luck!  Make some funny faces and I'd be a happy guy!"
"Hey Everyone! I'm playing my first show on Friday.","Staying relaxed is key.  If you get too nervous you risk distracting yourself from playing the best show you can.  Reminding yourself that you're there to have a good time should help keep you grounded.  Have fun! "

"New Sworn In Album: THE LOVERS/THE DEVIL Comes Out 4/7/15","Should've been called The Blegh/BLEGH BLEGH"
"I went through all of Kingdom of Giants Discography and made a video that shows the progression of their band...","https://vimeo.com/120999535

I also took out the majority of the clean singing because that's my least favorite part of this genre. Anyway it's pretty interesting to listen to if you've got a half hour to dedicate to listening to a kick ass band. I put this in a text post because I didn't want anyone to think I did this to be a karma whore, I wanted to show the progression of this band.

(Also I'm aware I didn't put 'Who I Once Was' or 'Guns and Girls' from Every Wave and Sound and Ground Culture because in order to compare those two tracks you need to actually listen to them the whole way through)

This is one of my favorite up and coming bands and I wouldn't have heard them without this sub!

"
"I went through all of Kingdom of Giants Discography and made a video that shows the progression of their band...","I like this idea, it would be cooler IMO to have like a 5 minute version of this so people who aren't familiar with them would check it out. I haven't listened to them since their first EP a while ago, but it was cool to skip through and see how their sound has changed."
"I went through all of Kingdom of Giants Discography and made a video that shows the progression of their band...","I didn't really think a 5 minute one would do them justice, but I could try it! I just thought it was a fun way to see how they've progressed, they keep getting heavier and heavier with each album. "
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","My local music store has these three Every Time I Die albums and I was wondering which one is the best to get out of these! 


Edit: Thank you all for the suggestions! I like their style but never gave them a thorough listen,  and I'm gonna for sure pick up Gutter Phenomenon next time I am there! "
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","I'd actually say New Junk Aesthetic"
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","All of the above "
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","I only can afford one sadly "
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","If you don't have any other albums, of those three, I'd start with Gutter"
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","I'd go with The Big Dirty. "
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","I would choose Gutter Phenomenon; it's classic ETID; you can't lose."
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","The Big Dirty "
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","Gutter Phenomenon for sure"
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","The cleans in that album are so off putting though, like in stiff."
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","I mean they're all great, but if I had to rank them:

Gutter Phenomenon

The Big Dirty

New Junk Aesthetic"
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","Thanks a million,  I've rarely listened if them and don't know their material yet "
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","I'd say go for The Big Dirty, that's my favorite ETID album."
"The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?","Out of those three I'd reccommend New Junk as its my personal favorite.  But really you can't go wrong with any of them and I hope you enjoy whichever you pick up!"

"Of Mice And Men - Deluxe Version of Restoring Force ""Full Circle""","Okay, it's been out for a week now. What are everyone's thoughts on the new music, and the direction of this band? 
Here are links to the new songs -

"Of Mice And Men - Deluxe Version of Restoring Force ""Full Circle""","can't really word it better myself. these tours they're doing are so huge they're changing to appeal to a larger crowd. I was really hoping we would get at least one more song that's geared with heavier riffs and more screaming."
"Of Mice And Men - Deluxe Version of Restoring Force ""Full Circle""","At this point I'll just stick to The Flood"
"Of Mice And Men - Deluxe Version of Restoring Force ""Full Circle""","Say what you want, but they're still awesome live.

I never like them until I saw them live a couple years ago when they supported BMTH and I was thoroughly impressed. I saw them again a couple of days ago and it was an even better show. There was no predominant focus on the 'newest album' like a lot of bands do, they were still heavy as and even mixed it up and bit and threw in some breakdowns into their slower/gentler songs for the crowd.

Songs like this aren't the best, but you can't blame them for trying to expand their fanbase, and as long as they don't change their attitude to shows I don't have a problem."
"Of Mice And Men - Deluxe Version of Restoring Force ""Full Circle""","Couldn't agree more. The newer songs work ridiculously well live. "

"Every Time I Die - Partying Is Such Sweet Sorrow","Southern metalcore/mathcore metalcore actually varies heaps."
"Every Time I Die - Partying Is Such Sweet Sorrow","&gt; southern punk metal

That's hardcore punk + southern metal, which would still be metalcore. Also no metalcore is still 'traditional' metalcore which was really just hardcore played with metal riffs."

"Northern Lights (Mikey Sawyer &amp; Josh Kikta of Miss Fortune/Michael Skaggs of Outline in Color) - ASHAMED [New Song/Band's Debut]","Josh Kikta is an incredible guitar player and it really sucks that you can barely hear any guitar in there. Maybe its the shitty Facebook embedment audio compressing, but its likely that the producer is Cameron Mizell, who infamously *muted* both guitarists of Memphis May Fire on Unconditional.

They also said they'd be somewhat nu-metal, not hearing that so far. 

Regardless, its not bad. Looking forward to what the rest brings. "
"Northern Lights (Mikey Sawyer &amp; Josh Kikta of Miss Fortune/Michael Skaggs of Outline in Color) - ASHAMED [New Song/Band's Debut]","Josh Kikta is incredible, but you are wrong. Cameron Mizell is a great producer and has produced many records with pronounced guitar work such as Of Machine's *As If Everything Was Held in Place* and the recent Mireau debut *The World In Your Way*.

Memphis May Fire's very own guitarist and only original member, Kellen McGregor, has been producing or involved heavily in the production of every MMF release since 2010. The guitars sound the way they do on *Unconditional* because the band wants them to sound that way. That is probably the case here with this song."
"Northern Lights (Mikey Sawyer &amp; Josh Kikta of Miss Fortune/Michael Skaggs of Outline in Color) - ASHAMED [New Song/Band's Debut]","Sorry to break it to you holmes, but from personally speaking to Kellen and asking him about why the guitars are so forced to the background on Unconditional, I know it to be the case. He told me that it was intentionally made to sound that way to highlight Matty's voice and it was NOT his call...which means its either Rise, Mizell, or both. 

I have nothing against Cameron Mizell, I think he's pretty good at what he does and I'm a fan of a lot of it, but this does not appear to be his best work. "
"Northern Lights (Mikey Sawyer &amp; Josh Kikta of Miss Fortune/Michael Skaggs of Outline in Color) - ASHAMED [New Song/Band's Debut]","Sick as fuck, don't forget that the drummer is also from a pretty cool post-hardcore band called Elenora."
"Northern Lights (Mikey Sawyer &amp; Josh Kikta of Miss Fortune/Michael Skaggs of Outline in Color) - ASHAMED [New Song/Band's Debut]","Of course. Nick Taylor is a beast, and [Sterling Morrison aka Ghost Noise] (https://soundcloud.com/iamghostnoise) has done some sick stuff on his own. Their future stuff is going to be much more heavily EDM-influenced. I'm so stoked."

Good song, but really didn't like the production here, hopefully it improves."
"Northern Lights (Mikey Sawyer &amp; Josh Kikta of Miss Fortune/Michael Skaggs of Outline in Color) - ASHAMED [New Song/Band's Debut]","Haven't heard a good Mizell mix in a while. Why do bands keep going to him?"
"Northern Lights (Mikey Sawyer &amp; Josh Kikta of Miss Fortune/Michael Skaggs of Outline in Color) - ASHAMED [New Song/Band's Debut]","I think it probably has to do with the contacts he could potentially set a band up with. It sure as hell isn't his mixes. "
"Northern Lights (Mikey Sawyer &amp; Josh Kikta of Miss Fortune/Michael Skaggs of Outline in Color) - ASHAMED [New Song/Band's Debut]","All of his mixes/production sounds the same, much like Caleb Shomo's.

"I'm in search of a new hi-fi system (or other sound system). Any recommendations?","Hi, I'm listening quite a lot music (metalcore, posthardcore and this stuff..). Im listening only with my computer, so i dont care to much about a receiver with many features.
The problem is that i dont know, wether the genere im listeing to has an impact on which equipment is the best for me. Should i just buy the onec that has the best testresults?

Thanks for any advice."
"I'm in search of a new hi-fi system (or other sound system). Any recommendations?","tbh I prefer metal through headphones, but for something with a huge dense sound like metalcore you definitely need 2 nice 4 way towers and a big ol' sub that can clearly reproduce double bass rolls and 808 samples without sounding muddy."
"I'm in search of a new hi-fi system (or other sound system). Any recommendations?","Also there's nothing more satisfying than being able to feel that music pounding your body through a good hi fi system. Sounds AND feels great."

"Favorite metalcore riff?","Opening to Cursing Akhenaten by After the Burial"
"Favorite metalcore riff?","And Fractal Effect and Rareform and Beserker and Aspiration... And pretty much the whole album is a riff fest."
"Favorite metalcore riff?","It's such a fun album to listen to. I know it's a chugfest, but I feel like A Vicious Reforming of Features doesn't get enough love. I would KILL to see them play that one live! "
"Favorite metalcore riff?","The opening riff in Dispossession by Northlane."
"Favorite metalcore riff?","I'll do my top 5:

1. The Devil Wears Prada - My Questions (this entire song is just one long kick ass jam)

2. The Devil Wears Prada - Escape (tough call between this one and My Questions, but this guitar riff slays)

3. Structures - The Worst Of Both Worlds (god what an awesome riff)

4. Of Mice &amp; Men - OG Loko (hate me for it)

5. The Dillinger Escape Plan - 43% Burnt (I SMELL THAT WHORE!!!!!!!)"

Or to go with one that's not ripping off At the Gates, [The Weak Willed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdA5Br5qGQQ) by All That Remains. "
"Favorite metalcore riff?","The main riff in The Weak Willed is so fucking brutal. "
"Favorite metalcore riff?","Melodic Metalcore rarely gets heavy, I think The Weak Willed is the heaviest Melodic Metalcore song I've ever heard. "
"Favorite metalcore riff?","Opening riff of Nothing Left by As I Lay Dying. One of the best I've ever heard.

THAT riff in Dementia by ERRA, you know which one.

The ending (last ~1 minute) of Beauty in Tragedy by ABR."
"Favorite metalcore riff?","That Beauty in Tragedy riff is so good"
"Favorite metalcore riff?","Yep, it's also basically the song that made me fall in love with ABR."
"Favorite metalcore riff?","For me it was the 2nd second half of Meddler."
"Favorite metalcore riff?","Ah, for me it was Empire, since that one wasn't out yet, but I can definitely see why"
"Favorite metalcore riff?","Beauty in Tragedy live was so good, being in the pit for that was nuts."

"Favorite metalcore riff?","The whole Volition album in general is just full of crazy riffs"
"Favorite metalcore riff?","[Opening riff] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVP5gJBmRtA) of The End of Heartache. This song played during the end credits of Resident Evil: Apocalypse, which is the first time I heard it or anything by Killswitch. That riff is the kind of riff that makes your skin tingle and sweat a little because it's so good. I immediately had to know what band it was, and when I found out I bought the album. And that, ladies and gentlemen was how I was introduced to metalcore. "

Also, Sleepwalker by Parkway Drive"
"Favorite metalcore riff?","Karma - Parkway. You know which one"
"Favorite metalcore riff?","It woupd have to be the riff at like the 1 minute mark of ""glacial pace"" by Converge.

Edit: I would link, but it would use data. The line that follows the riff is ""if being alive is just to survive "" fuck it's so awesome"
"Favorite metalcore riff?","This one right [here?](http://youtu.be/4eji87lXFmc?t=1m29s)

On a side note, THAT ART. Jacob Bannon produces the best art I've ever laid my eyes on. The colours, textures and layout of all his work astounds me. "
"Favorite metalcore riff?","Yep  that one, sick aye? And yes! He is such a good artist, you have to see his Jane Doe booklet too"
"Favorite metalcore riff?","Yeah its a sweet riff ;) And man, I love the Jane Doe art. I just picked up this [shirt](http://kingsroadmerch.s3.amazonaws.com/images/us/1/7/8/17876_400x400.jpg) a few weeks ago, it's probably my favourite band tee!"
"Favorite metalcore riff?","I only recently bought Jane doe and looking at the booklet I was just amazed, I unfortunately haven't got any converge shirts, I'll try to buy one with the next Converge album or when I do another big deathwish haul. That shirt you got awesome, nice work!"
"Favorite metalcore riff?","Thanks! They always have a few badass shirts to pick from in their merch store, you should nab one!"
"Favorite metalcore riff?","I think they were out when I did my last order, but I have two death wish shirts, la dispute, Touche Amore and Code Orange Kids shirts, but I really want mire, just shipping is unbelievable...

If they come to NZ soon, I'll make sure to pick some up."
"Favorite metalcore riff?","Yikes I could only imagine the shipping costs. You have some great taste, btw!"
"Favorite metalcore riff?","Thank you, I would say you do too. Who are some of your favourites ? I decided to buy on black Friday due to the deals and the shipping added up to about 8-14% but it was a big order as I got stuff for my friend so we saved on shipping."
"Favorite metalcore riff?","My tastes vary quite a bit; I tend to listen to more progressive metal these days but I always go back to my metalcore roots since that's pretty much where I started when it comes to heavier music. My favourites (at the moment) are probably Protest the Hero, BtBam, Northlane, Revocation, Deafheaven, Converge, The Contortionist, Dillinger Escape Plan, Erra, and Misery Signals"
"Favorite metalcore riff?","I enjoy almost all those bands, haven't heard revocation though. I don't know much prog but I dig early mastodon "
"Favorite metalcore riff?","Revocation is a weird one for me. I've listened to every record since their 2nd one came out and aside from a couple songs I never really got into them. I bought their latest album on a whim, loved it, and now for some reason I enjoy the previous albums that I pretty much wrote off. Anyways, they're on the thrashier side of death metal so they aren't everyone's cup of tea but listen to [Labyrinth of Eyes](http://youtu.be/CwSEJBq7gYU) and [The Blackest Reaches](http://youtu.be/l_NvpwEQj9Q) and see what you think!

Oh yeah, Mastodon is another one of my favourites! They've really shifted their style from their earlier stuff but they're still great. Crack The Skye is one of my favourite prog metal records if you wanna check that out too!"

"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I can see this. I've watched interviews of these guys since I was a kid, and they just seem so tired. Mike especially seems like he just doesn't like metalcore or even his older work in TDWP much anymore."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","They've made it pretty clear that none of them are fans of their older work. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Haven't they also stated that they're not really friends?

They get along with each other well enough, but when they're home, they never see each other. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Sounds like me and my co-workers, too..."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I heard Mike say in an interview that they aren't each others *best* friends, but that they all get along. Plus they don't all live in the same place, so it makes sense that they wouldn't see each other when they aren't touring, writing, or recording.  "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","This is how most real bands are. You're buddies on the road and in the studio but if you're touring extensively you need a break when you come home."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","How much of their old work don't they like? Just the first couple albums?"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Only the first album.  They play a few songs live here and there on Plagues."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I know they dislike Dear Love. I think they're pretty ok with the music from Plagues and Roots but I think they feel embarrassed by stuff like the goofy song titles."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I love TDWP. Headlined the first concert I went to. But I wouldn't be shocked, honestly."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I will cry for eternity if this happens."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","/u/chraaazzz"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","who is tdwp?"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","The Devil Wears Prada"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","[deleted]"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I can see this. The last album was a definite step down and didn't sell as much. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","It did not sell as much yes. But I would *definitely* not say it was a step down. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Maybe they aren't ""big,"" but A Skylit Drive. And that's exactly why I can see them being next. They've been around for *years* but have never seen much more than being a direct support band on many tours. Throw a ton of lineup changes in there, and the fact that they sound so similar to so many younger bands who completely passed them up on the way up the metalcore/post-hardcore ladder, I could see them finally putting it to rest. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","This is definetly the one I see the most, on warped tour at least at the date I saw they were put on a stage that was mostly crappy local picked up for the tour bands and the little I saw of them they didn't seem very happy. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Even, and unfortunately, bands like Ice Nine Kills who have been around for ages yet don't ever see real success. Its good to see INK getting some more exposure lately, but they've been playing the support game for a real long time. Being a supporting act for For All Those Sleeping and Capture the Crown, and now recently Motionless in White, must suck (or at least be discouraging) when you know you've been around twice as long. 

I hope they don't, though. They get much better with every album. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","To be fair, Ice Nine Kills only recently started getting mainstream success (like 2012 onwards)
I reckon they've still got a bit in them (considering they went from the Ernie Ball stage to Monster Energy stage in warped tour)

A Skylit Drive haven't really gone places as much (they started off well and have gone down hill)
Whilst Ice Nine Kills are only starting to go uphill (in my opinion)"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","No, I definitely agree, you aren't wrong. INK is trending upward for sure, and hopefully the momentum carries them into bigger and better things. 

I was just saying bands *like them* that grind it out for *years* to see limited success, if at all, must get discouraged at some point(s). I don't see an INK breakup imminent though, they are heading in a good direction. Just using them as another example alongside A Skylit Drive. 

Another one is the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. One huge debut single and a mildly successful debut album only to see numerous lineup changes (down to one original member) and stagnant album/tour success. Don't see them lasting much longer. Perhaps that was a better example than INK, I just used them as it was /u/coolbad96 's flair and they popped into my head.

Ironically, RJA and ASD are (or recently were) co-headlining a tour.  "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","It's so crazy that INK has technically been around since 2002 or so, and they're just now getting some success."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I'm playing a show with them in March, they are touring with Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Lol yea I know about the tour, you should see my response to highelf04 above.

Pretty cool though, big ups to you and your band."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Thanks man, they are definitely dying bands, but it will be a cool throwback show, "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I could also see their singer going solo, or getting with a more poppy style band. I feel like he has a voice that could make him popular with the masses. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Jag has a solo song already released...
It's not good..."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Haha, I didn't say Me (or this sub) would like his solo music. But I could see him becoming more and more pop over time. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Unfortunately you're probably right. One of my favorites but this lineup change is gonna fuck them up I think. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","the frontman made it pretty clear in an ap interview that hes in it for the long haul"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","A skylit drive

They cancelled their last UK tour, and the one before was a big old flop (it's a sad moment when a support act is called out for 1 more song, and the main act isn't)

They lost a lot of momentum after Identity on fire, took too long to release Rise and haven't bought anything new to the table..."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I can see Oh, Sleeper go into hiatus at least. With Shane getting on big tours with Wovenwar and the rest of the band trying to settle down, there's not much coming in the future.

Another candidate would be Capture the Crown, because the one dude who's left is in crazy debt right now. Either he convinces four others to share that with him or he's spending the rest of his life working his ass off.

And finally, there's La Dispute. While there are not really signs that they'll break up, they're definitely going slower than they were in the times of *Somewhere...* and *Wildlife*. Jordan also once said in an interview that they no longer want to tour full time and rather focus on their own lives when they're not on tour/writing. So, maybe no breakup, but at least a hiatus."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","O, S seems to basically be on hiatus in all but name really. 


And I hope not LA Dispute, I loved rooms of the house... "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I mean they literally said they were on hiatus, so."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","They are on touring hiatus but stuff is being written and recorded."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Yeah a couple weeks ago micha posted a bad ass clip in the studio "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I don't think CtC is going to break up at least not this year they have a tour planned for this year. And they also have made a lot of twitter posts about big plans for this year. I know twitter is a huge promise but it looks like they wanna move foward."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I would say, and I hope not, but Alesana will probably release their new album, then I don't know after that. They have slowed up, gone on to do other things, starting their own label. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Yeah I can agree with you, but at least they would be pulling out while they are still sort of on top of their game. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Finish the Annabel Trilogy dammit!"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Yeah. They seem to be moving so slowly, they'll probably just stop soon"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I could see Escape the fate quitting soon. In interviews craig and Tj said dead rabbits is more fun and natural while etf has some legal issues and are getting tired of line up changes."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","yep i could see this"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","The Dead Rabbitts is way better anyways. I've been saying for awhile ETF should call it quits so TDR can get more attention. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","On a side note, I really hope Max Green actually gets his band Violet New Breed up and running. They only have a couple songs out at the moment, but I'm excited to see more."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Not metalcore but Brokencyde

"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","rip BREEBREE"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","All That Remains."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I've listened to both No Knock and This Probably Won't End Well and both songs damn near put me to sleep. If there will never be another Fall of Ideals, I think they'd be better hanging it up...all on good terms of course."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Couldn't agree more. Fall of Ideals was perfection. Honestly, their guitarist is way too talented to stop here though."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","It doesn't help that since A War You Cannot Win, Phil has been sneaking pro-libertarian lyrics into songs. I just sort of wish he'd keep his politics to himself."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Nah, they've been singing about that stuff since at least Fall of Ideals. And I don't got a problem with it, I'd rather someone sing about politics and things that actually matter instead of stupid hope-core bullshit."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I agree with you on the hope-core stuff. I just feel like ranting about a very specific political agenda through your band's music can alienate your audience."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","so can the christcore stuff, but you still see bands doing it"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","You're right, lyrics can definitely alienate people if you don't agree with the message. I, for one, hardly ever even notice lyrics, so whether or not I agree with the message usually doesn't affect my listening experience x)"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","also he's a homophobic prick"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Is he? I remember him making some derogatory remarks about Black Veil Brides. Phil's also a pain on social media, always spewing his shitty beliefs. Which is a shame, because everyone else in the band seem like cool people. It ultimately makes it very difficult to be a fan of the band, despite having made some of the best songs in this genre."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","he basically said that gay people don't have the right to feel persecuted or oppressed (especially when the word faggot is used) because they weren't made into slaves like black people were. guy is a fucking douche canoe"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","He doesn't hate gay people and homophobe is a horrible word to describe him. He's just an asshole all around."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I'm putting all my money on Falling in Reverse. Mostly cause I hate them, but also cause Ronnie Radke is a ticking bomb from what I can tell."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Honestly, if their new album is going to be a DIYLF 2.0, then it's definitely going to get them more fans and more popularity than they already have. I hate FIR, but their new album seems pretty good so far ngl"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I'm with you there. The new record will probably really take off, especially with the radio play they're getting with ""God If You Are Above..."""
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","^

Huge fan of Ronnie-era Escape The Fate, not a huge fan of Falling In Reverse's stuff until I heard the two singles from the new album. I felt like I was in 2006 again, I'm now a Falling In Reverse fan (if the rest of the album is as good)."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Don't see them losing any momentum or breaking up for lack of success any time soon, they're one of the biggest bands in the alternative scene.

But I guess Ronnie is always a potential concern. He seems to be doing alright though. That whole ""firing his entire band"" thing was just a hoax by the media, and he has yet to break his 6+ year sobriety streak. The whole band looks to be really good friends too, from a fan's standpoint. 

Yep, I'm a FiR fan. Haha"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","/r/AntiRadkeWatch"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I wish, mainly because I can't stand them. They are printing money though. That band is in a good financial state and the band gets along. No label will kick em off either because of the type of money they pull."

"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","nah, if anything Radke will get kicked from the band and they'll continue without him. (which they REALLY REALLY need to do)"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","that is the last thing that is going to happen since it is his band"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Oh, Sleeper I guess. Shane has Wovenwar and the rest of the bands seems to be busy with their personal lives, house and kids, all that stuff. They're already on an hiatus."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I wouldn't be surprised about Asking Alexandria, as much of a problem as Danny was getting to be, he was sort of a major part of the band, and I don't think they'll last much longer."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I actually think theyre going to be around longer now that Danny isn't in the band"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I'm not sure, it seems like with the new guy/playing Warped again, they're trying to just go back to their original fanbase, and I've noticed a lot of times, when a band tries too hard to go back to their ""old sound"", it's usually the beginning of the end"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I think it all depends on how much of an influence Danny was over their latest sound. If he was the driving force behind it, and Ben and everyone else still have their heavy elements, then they make be able to make it work. This next album I think is going to determine a lot"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Im excited to see what they do with their new album. I havent really been a fan of Reckless and Relentless or From Death to Destiny. R&amp;R was ok in my opinion. Stand Up and Scream is one of my favorite albums in this genre, so if they don't fuck up trying to get back to that style, i think it''ll be pretty rad."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I definitely agree with you there, it doesn't seem like Ben is too interested in the heavy stuff either though, which could be weird with how they seem to be trying to at least somewhat go back to their older sound"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Idk, I haven't followed them since R&amp;R, so I have no idea what their interests are. If they put out good stuff, then great. If not, well wouldnt really bother me at all haha"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Yeah, I actually preferred FDTD, but as far as their future, I don't care too much, there are a bunch of bands I like a lot more, I just feel like they won't be around much longer"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I feel like AA will still be the same, considering Ben writes most of the music."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Hopefully they go back to their heavier sound and since I follow Ben on twitter he's hinted multiple times that they'll be going back to a 'heavier' sound."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","That's true, he does, I'm just not sure what the future's going to be like for them, not that I really care though, since I don't listen to them as much as I did about a year ago anyway"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I gotcha, I'm the same way.

As long as A7x and BTF stay together, I'm good haha"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I'm definitely hoping BTF stays together, great band"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","For sure, and theyre only getting better"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I agree, Hollow Bodies was probably my second favorite album from 2013, and I'm excited about what the new one's going to be like. Plus they're great live

Edit: Actually probably my third favorite, forgot about Augment by Erra for a minute"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I remember reading a tweet from Beau that said some of the riff's Erics been working have given him goosebumps. I'm so hyped for it.

And theyre one of my favorite live bands. I can't wait to see them again at warped. I went to the Charlotte date last year and they were the last band to play and everyone was there. I was at the front and it was intense"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Sounds good, excited to see them again at Warped too, the 2013 Warped tour was the first time I saw them, and that was great."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","For sure"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Give me some examples if you can."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Nothing overly specific, but I've just noticed a pattern, where usually bands that are on the verge of falling off will try to reach out to their old fanbase in a desperate attempt to stay relevant. It seems like Escape the Fate is doing that now by playing Warped tour again, after playing more radio-rock shows for a while, and it's pretty obvious they won't be around much longer. Red Jumpsuit Apparatus is another band like that, who went after the radio crowd for a while, but now is coming back to the ""scene"" because they're not relevant anymore"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Not sure if a joke oooooooooooor?"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I'm not a huge fan of them in general, but I just don't think they're going to be around much longer, just my opinion"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I think it depends on how they perform on Warped Tour, if people still go cray for them maybe they might do a few tours after. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","That's true, I have a feeling that with the new vocalist though, they're just going to sound really generic, especially if they're really focusing on going back to their ""old sound"", which whether you like it or not, was very generic"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Well... I HOPE Hellyeah calls it quits soon... I just want mudvayne back :( "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","How has no one said Memphis May Fire??"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Their latest album debuted at number 4 on the BillBoard 200. Mother fuckers ain't going anywhere any time soon. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Sure they are. They're going to other genres of music."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Aw man I just got into them, I'd hate to see them go"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Parkway Drive. They did 2 tours in 2014 and haven't announced a single one for 2015 yet. I love them but they're about to split "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I honestly cant tell if youre joking Lol.Theyre still working on the album due this summer. Also theyre already playing two of the biggest german festivals Rock am Ring and Rock im Park."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","The people in this thread are hilarious. The ones denying a band will quit soon as if you have some information that the band isn't going to call it quits. Any band can be gone at anytime, no matter how successful they've been. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Fan girls just upset that someone would have the audacity to mention there favorite band might not make music for the rest of their lives."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Parkway Drive.
I saw them live on 8 december and damn, winston look so tired tbh."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","That would break my heart. Them, Killswitch, and ABR are really the last of the old guard from when I got into the scene."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","But Atreyu is back! The three you named, Atreyu, and BFMV are my five originals."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I never liked Atreyu. BFMV was up there though, so were ATR and HTD.

(All these acronyms make me laugh... To an outsider this is gibberish)"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","All respect to Atreyu, but unless they put out a record full of songs that are heavier than their newest single, it's gonna be hard for me to get back into them. I have all of their music, and enjoy each record, but I'd much rather have a new ""The Curse"" than a new ""Lead Sails Paper Anchor"". "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I'd burst into tears. Not actually, but i would be so damn upset. They're my favorite band, it would be such a shame to see them go. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Yeah I don't see this one. Just judging by their social media posts and from the short doco of their Europe tour with HSB, it looks like they've still got so much energy. Winston is always so hyped and positive and they're working on a new album which will be huge. They're already pretty massive but their last European tour really solidified that. I know he's doing community based things in Byron Bay at the moment but I can't see Parkway calling it any time soon."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Pretty sure thats not happening anytime soon"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Because you know more about them than him, right? "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","i'd hate to see parkway go. they're so talented imo"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","No, it just doesn't seem like they are going to quit, judging by their instagram/twitter posts and how they are doing live."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Of Mice &amp; Men, hopefully. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Nah, they're just now starting to really cash in."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I know...I just want to see them go out with dignity. 

It probably won't happen. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","They've lost any and all dignity by this point."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","As metallica said,""Sold out?Yea we sold out....a million."""
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","All those lives they have saved and they couldn't save their own."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","DAE h8 restore force?"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I wasn't big on The Flood either. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","One can only dream. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Escape The Fate and/or Asking Alexandria as far as metalcore goes."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I know no one wants to hear it, including myself.. but im thinking August Burns Red "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Really? 
They signed to Fearless and are releasing a new album soon, they've had a really solid lineup as well.
Maybe a hiatus, but not calling it quits :/"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Yeah, signing a multi-album contract with a new label isn't really how you go about calling it quits."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","From what JB has been saying recently, I think that's pretty unlikely

Edit: It seems like they're slowing down a bit on the touring, since most of them are married now, and Brent has a kid, but I don't think they'll stop playing music any time soon"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I chilled with them after their set on Frozen Flame Tour for an hour or two and tbh I think /u/dougcourt is right, I'd rather not say exactly why but he's onto something."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","lets just say i have heard somethings as well. much before this thread decided to pop up."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Damn, that's not a good sign"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I really don't think so. What makes you think that?
"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Im simply going off of how long the band has been together, + where they are in their life. They have families now, they have other careers. They are honrstly one of my favorite metal core banded but that's no reason to NOT be realistic about what bands are coming to an end. "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","they said in an interview I red that they have no plans on slowing down"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","[deleted]"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Jake was in the AMA, he just didn't answer as many questions, and Matt answered questions the next day, since he was busy at the time. Also, at least from my experience from meeting them at the Frozen Flame tour last month and what they've been posting on social media, they all seem to be getting along pretty well at the moment"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Looks like Veil of Maya, After the Burial, and Invent Animate are touring together and this is a double date.

"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I'm really interested in that link for ATB, can you hook a brother up"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","Bring Me The Horizon. They will put out a new album and then BAM! out of nowhere they will call it quits. Oli will focus on his clothing line more becoming more of an entrepreneur, or maybe work on some other music projects that are a completely different genre of music. The other band members will try to start up different projects of their own or just call it quits with their music careers and settle down."
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","this doesn't make any sense, they're doing better than ever and seem to be happy where they are."

"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","it's all hypothetical"
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","And if they don't they'r going to lose the fan base they have, if their next album sounds like drown they're going to lose a lot of the people that didn't like drown. They've gotten really soft especially when you compare drown deathbeds and a bunch of their newer softer stuff to pray for plagues and suicide season "
"Who will be the next ""big"" band to call it quits?","I think they've gained more fans than lost fans by ditching their deathcore sound and for the better. As much as I like their old stuff, I just associate it with them being immature, angry, and drugged out teens. Its nice to see them happy with their new music and in a good place in their lives."

Edit: Also, I'm extremely jealous that you were able to get the Thrill Seeker vinyl, I went to the store about an hour before they opened, there was already a huge line, and it was gone by the time I got inside. I did get the Messengers one though"

"For fans of ABR (I need to tell someone)","Nice! I didn't have a chance to see them with this tour (Frozen Flame Tour) let alone get a VIP meet opportunity. I did have however seen the twice in a neighboring town when they toured in 2012 and most recently with Asking Alexandria in 2014. I only got to see Jake this last one and I had bought their Leveler vinyl at the show so I got that signed. Next I have all their albums on vinyl now (Except for Constrllations of course :/ ) next chance I get I will definitely pick up a VIP ticket to get them signed."

"Recording shows","A couple days after seeing the frozen flame show, I really wish I could do it again lol. Just saying, if bands recorded every show and made a shitty DVD of it, I would totally pay money for that. I feel like that's a win win, I get to have a permanent copy of a great show, they get $10. "
"Recording shows","The equipment it would take to record these shows in a good enough quality would be atrociously expensive or else I'm sure labels would be doing it more often. I do second you, though. I'd definitely pay $10. "
"Recording shows","I like the idea but its pretty unrealistic to do it at *every show*. It wouldn't be a bad idea for bands to professionally record one specific show from each tour then just promote on their facebook/twitter and sell it on their merch sites. I would probably buy that. "
"Recording shows","It'd be happy if they just recorded one full set on one stop of a tour or something. No point in recording every single show with the exact same set."
"Recording shows","Kinda off topic, but I saw Linkin Park's Projekt Revolution in 2008 I think they recorded all their shows and you could buy a downloadable copy at the merch table. I know for sure they recorded my show because, well I have a copy of it. Great move, still love listening to that show."

"Albums I might have missed as an ex-fan of the genre?","Yo so I used to listen to metalcore a few years ago (and the music I listened to then I still do now), but kinda fell out of the scene. I was listening to BMTH, TDWP, Eatmewhileimhot!, A Skylit Drive, Attack! Attack!, Asking Alexandria, bands like that. As far as these bands go I do NOT like new BMTH or Asking Alexandria for the record. I generally lost interest in metalcore because the newer albums that were being pushed sounded generic or boring to me. I mostly listen to progrock and mathrock type stuff now, but what have I missed that you think I might like? Of mice and men formed right around the end of my metalcore 'career' so I know bout em but was never super into em."

Note-Alot of people like to compare TIJ to ABR. PERSONALLY I see no resemblance and think TIJ is better (Not hating on ABR I like them alot, music is opinion). 

Give it a listen, even if it's just the first song I think you'll be able to tell they aren't generic or boring. The whole album is fantastic. "

"Albums I might have missed as an ex-fan of the genre?","I guess creative capacity counts, I know that their songs are pretty technical, but they aren't exactly a progressive band. Progressive music is defined by experimental music that usually focuses on jazz chords, the jazz scale, and atonal notes, which ABR has none of. Their songs are just really fast riffs on the phrygian and mixolydian scales."

"DEATHGAZE - SILENCE (sweet Japanese metalcore)",""
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","He pretty much hates everything else I've shared with him and I'm trying to find something heavy we can listen to together. I've showed him Creations, Reformers, Leaders, Haste The Day, Delamour, Day of Vengeance and countless local bands in my scene. I'm also trying to get him into punk music and he doesn't like any with yelling. Just stuff like H2O. If anyone has suggestions for stuff he might like suggest away!"
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","My first few bands were:

A Day To Remember

Of Mice &amp; Men

Parkway Drive

The Amity Affliction (not one of my first bands, but i think it would have been if i'd known them sooner)"
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","Show him Sempiternal and see if he likes it. Otherwise, some ADTR might be a good shot."
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","Blessthefall is a pretty good introductory band, they're the ones that got me into metalcore"
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","If he likes TCM and Beartooth then i would recommend to show him some of the more generic stuff like Asking Alexandria, Memphis May Fire and A Day To Remember. Great entry stuff!

And also if he likes bands with more cleans i would show him some SycAmour, they're more post-hardcore but they have som really heavy parts and some amazingly catchy choruses."
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","MOTHER

FUCKING 

SYCAMOUR"
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","Real talk though, we need a Sycamour flair :D"
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","Hop your sweet ass over to /r/PostHardcore, and your dreams will come true. "
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","Ahh of course, always getting mixed up with all these different sub genres &gt;.&lt;"
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","S'all good, man. "
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","Nothing More."
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","I would make him listen to stick to your guns. STYG has a nice mix of screaming and clean vocals (especially diamond and disobedient), so it can be great to easy people into heavier vocals."
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","Every Time I Die - The Big Dirty or Hot Damn both are fun albums with not too harsh vocals"
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","I think generic things would be good for him. Maybe things like A Day To Remeber, Of Mice and Men, Escape the Fate, Annisokay. 

 If he doesnt like screaming I can recommend Polyphia because they dont have any vocals! 

I can recommend Monuments to everyone..."
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","Show him Atreyu's second album The  Curse. [Demonology &amp; Heartache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp8DfzGsxTA) is my favorite from the album. But [Bleeding Mascara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIJdL-pWIs) is amazing too. 

That album is legit one of my favorite albums. "
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","Very first metal core band was Memphis May Fire. Give that a try."
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","I think he would enjoy Escape the Fate quite a bit but they are post hardcore, one of my favorite all time bands. Their album 'Dying is your Latest Fashion' specifically. Also one of the founding members (Max Green, bass player) has his own band he's starting up called Violent New Breed which I think may be up his alley as well, although they only have two song out at the moment.
He also enjoy some others:

-A Day to Remember

-Attack Attack! (only mention them because it's the same vocalist of Beartooth, Caleb Shomo.)

-Get Scared (I believe the Best Kind of Mess album, also post hardcore)

-Memphis May Fire

-You Me at Six

-Bring Me The Horizon

Some of those may not be what kind of thing he is looking for but it may be a start, if anything he may find some songs out of albums he likes quite a bit, and others not. Can't hurt to do a little digging.
"
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","You Me at Six? That seems like quite a strange recommendation. "
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","Some of their songs can have clean vocals. She said her bf doesn't like screaming yet he likes BT, and Caleb Shomo is one of the best screamers out there."
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","If he likes Beartooth try My Ticket Home's second album, While She Sleeps, The Ghost Inside as well.
Affiance? Try all your old school Gothenburg influenced bands like Killswitch, AILD, All That Remains, Trivium and stuff like that.
The Color Morale, you'd want stuff with a good balance of vocals and strong riffs, try Like Moths To Flames, In Hearts Wake, Bury Tomorrow, Blessthefall, Hands Like Houses."
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","Maybe try burden of a day's one one thousand album. It could get him more comfortable with screams :)"
"Trying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance","Outline In Colour is my all time favourite and have to recommend to fans of any kind of music, they are just so talented"

FATS broke up a few months ago though and they were label mates with INK anyway, so it doesn't really matter I suppose. It could also just be a coincidence, since it's kinda a classic 50's trope."

"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","I really dig your highs, IMO you should keep them that way. They're very original sounding and sound hard to pull off. You definitely sound as if you haven't perfected them yet, and upon reading that they're still really new for you I'm still honestly shocked. Keep the overall sound to your highs, don't try to emulate other vocalists too much. They're a great basis to start off of though.

"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","Damn! That was a really amazing cover man! Your screams are killer! I really dig the tone they have. I'd like to add more grit to mine but I'm still figuring all of it out.  

I'm a growler first and foremost. I've been doing the growls for a little over 2 years but I've only gotten into the screaming a couple of months ago, but I guess the growls at least gave me a head start there haha.  
 
Thanks for checking the cover out and leaving a reply man! Really appreciated :). "
"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","What's your set-up?"
"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","I have AKG Perception 220 condensor microphone and a SM58 dynamic microphone. The AKG is my go-to microphone when I record from my 'home studio', but I'll sometimes take out the SM58 (that I mainly use for live purposes) if I feel I need it. I love the AKG for cleans especially but for the more intense vocals like growls and screams I like to take out the SM58 to have more freedom in terms on moving around. I also have a sort of portable vocal booth for the AKG that [looks like this](https://www.musicmatter.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/800x800/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/p/o/portablevocalboothv22.jpg) and I record in an untreated room  
  
The microphones run into a Focusright Scarlett 2i2 USB interface, nothing fancy here really.  

I mix all the vocals in Reaper. I don't have too much going on, a bit of EQ to roll off a little on the lower end. Some compression to deal with the volumes and a little reverb and delay here and there. I sometimes use a bit of saturation if I feel the vocals need it, but that rarely happens.  
 
Hope that gave you a bit of insight! Feel free to ask if there's anything I can help with! I'm happy to help where I can :). "
"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","I've been out of the screaming game for a while now. Your cover brings me back to the good days though. Subbed you on YouTube, looking forward to more. 

You listen to Greeley estates? I feel like your highs would be dope on a song like straitjacket. "
"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","Yup! I'd listen to this on a regular basis. Outstanding lows, and pretty brutal highs (in the best way possible). "
"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","Thanks man! That's a huge compliment! I find it very hard to listen to my own vocals objectively, so I get a real kick when others seem to enjoy them :). Thanks for checking out the cover and leaving a comment!"
"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","Not a problem, looking forward to more! "
"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","Nice! I liked it. I have a question, how do you get the instrumentals of the song and then put your voice over it?"
"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","Popular bands such as AA have most songs on instrumental format somewhere on YouTube. Usually someone covers all the instruments and lets people freely use them for vocal covers."
"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","There is no instrumental for ""Morte Et Dabo"" this cover is just the regular ""vocals on top of the original track""."
"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","True! With some slight modifications here and there on the original track. "
"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","While this is true, I didn't use an instrumental for the cover. I explained it a bit more in depth in the comment above but what I do is lower the frequencies where the vocals 'cut-through' in the mix of the original. Then I replace those vocals with my own so that those will be the only ones you'll hear."
"Here's a vocal cover I did of Morte Et Dabo by Asking Alexandria. I'd like to know how you feel about this /r/metalcore!","I'll try to give a brief explanation of what I do, but I tend to ramble a bit when it comes to these subjects, so bear with me.  

What I do is I lower the frequences where the vocals 'cut-through' in the mix in the original. Basically, vocals cut through the rest of the mix at around 1,5-2KHz. So what I do is I put an equaliser on the original track and lower the 1,5-2KHz frequency range by about 4-5dB.  
 
Then I give my own vocals a bit of a boost at the 1,5KHz range to make sure that my vocals are the only ones you'll hear. The original vocals aren't all gone but you won't be able to hear them.  

I used to create my own 'instrumentals' by cutting out the vocals entirely by using a center extractor but I feel that takes away too much of the other instruments.  

I'm glad you enjoyed it, thanks for checking it out! I hope I managed to help you out a bit :). "

Maybe he just got sick of being the only active Christian in the band? maybe he got tired of touring with that kind of music? Who knows. 

One thing to realize is that Aaron joined the band when he was still in high school. He's grown up, he's gotten married, people change, especially when they're young. Maybe he realized he didn't like Underoath and much as he did when he was still playing drums for what was effectively his youth group's band? "

"Non-christian bands similar to for today?","Erra is a bit more djenty/progressive, but they have a somewhat similar sound, here's [Dreamcatcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI2a0firXFc)

Edit: Also, Fit For a King is Christian, but they're a lot less preachy, at least in most songs, and they have a very similar sound"
"Non-christian bands similar to for today?","To add, Erra is only similar to their first 3 albums. Immortal and after are too chug chug to be similar to Erra. Very accurate on FFAK though. "
"Non-christian bands similar to for today?","Yeah, that's sort of what I meant, I just didn't feel like explaining that in the original comment"
"Non-christian bands similar to for today?","Depends on what type of For Today you like, since their original stuff is way different than their new stuff.

For old: Within The Ruins and After The Burial

For new: Texas In July (the album Bloodwork especially) and The Ghost Inside"

"Non-christian bands similar to for today?","Ah, makes sense"
"Non-christian bands similar to for today?","I think it has to do with JT becoming their new vocalist or whatever since their original vocalist wrote lyrics with christian themes."
"Non-christian bands similar to for today?","That definitely makes sense then"

"
"Sworn In - Sunshine (audio)","They actually had some decently technical stuff. "
"Sworn In - Sunshine (audio)","IMO mathcore is a bit more than technicality, it has a relatively unique sound and uses time signatures that aren't 4/4. A lot of Sworn In has parts that have a weird feel but are still 4/4. I guess I can see why someone would think that they're mathcore, but I would say that they're wrong.

As an aside I'm both a huge fan of mathcore and Sworn In, so I'm not trying to denigrade them."
"Sworn In - Sunshine (audio)","Yeah, when I think of mathcore I think of old Dillinger. "

"Intro - An American Shootout / My favourite intro of all time",""
"So could somebody explain the difference between Metalcore, Hardcore, Post Hardcore etc","Just to clear things up for us amateurs "
"So could somebody explain the difference between Metalcore, Hardcore, Post Hardcore etc","Hardcore ""hardcore punk"" - basically heavier and faster punk. Lyrical themes are usually political or anti-conformism. Vocals are also  mostly yelling.
Post-hardcore - probably the most ambiguous of the ""core"" genres since it literally means the movement of music after hardcore. Fugazi are credited for being pioneers of the genre so a lot of ph bands nowadays tend to have influences from them on their records. Expressiveness and punk influences seem to be what most ph bands have in common, but you can get any range of sounds from half-shouted poetry like La Dispute to screamed/diva sung vocals accompanied with super noodly guitars like Dance Gavin Dance.
Metalcore ""Metallic Hardcore"" - it Started as metal influenced hardcore but the sound has changed quite a bit throughout the years. It's had several phases where bands like Converge, Botch, and Coalesce were the heavyweights, then it transitioned to bands like Killswitch Engage, Atreyu, and As I Lay Dying, and now bands like Asking Alexandria and a bunch of Rise Records bands seem to have taken over the genre's sound. It's gotten to the point where some bands prefer to be called metallic hardcore than be associated with ""metalcore"". If the song you're listening to has a breakdown that sounds like ""dun dun dunna dunna dun"", you're probably listening to metalcore. Also, Vocals are usually a combination of singing and screaming.

These may not be the best examples but they are what i like from each genre. 

Metalcore: Has metal influences like melodeath riffs and very often has a break down and lots of chugging though it ranges a lot as a lot of bands don't fit that.

Post hardcore - sounds more punk/hardcore like if you listened to what i linked it sounds like an evolution of hardcore, which means its just what happened after hardcore, quite often you'll find clean vocals and more technical guitars than normal hardcore.

Hardcore: I'm not sure how to describe it, as it is ""hardcore punk"" but its changed a lot since the beginning and the sound of minor threat and bad brains what most people associate hardcore with, has changed a lot, but mainly harsh vocals, a bit of chugs just not metal influenced."
"So could somebody explain the difference between Metalcore, Hardcore, Post Hardcore etc","Chugs? I've never heard this term.."

"So could somebody explain the difference between Metalcore, Hardcore, Post Hardcore etc","Metalcore is a mix of metal, and hardcore punk rock. Hardcore is just short for hardcore punk rock. Post hardcore is the new wave of hardcore punk rock, but is less actual punk rock, and more just one-note breakdowns that last the entire song it seems."

"Miss May I playing Warped tour","On sunday, Levi from Miss May I did a Younow livestream, which out of boredom, I decided to watch, and he pretty much revealed that they're playing Warped tour this year"
"Miss May I playing Warped tour","Would have thought they would have been on Mayhem again rather than warped.

Aren't Miss May I trying for the whole ""Defend heavy metal"" ethos?
Seems a bit out of place on warped..."
"Miss May I playing Warped tour","Weird since they're not heavy metal at all"
"Miss May I playing Warped tour","But they're way more influenced by bands like As I Lay Dying and In Flames than bands like The Ghost Inside or The Devil Wears Prada."
"Miss May I playing Warped tour","Well, admitted they aren't at all.

But Levi and the rest of them pride themselves on the whole ""Don't let metal die"" etc.etc. stuff

And in my opinion thats better suited to mayhem than warped"
"Miss May I playing Warped tour","I know they do, but it's weird seeing as though they've gotten softer with every album they've put out."
"Miss May I playing Warped tour","It seems like they're trying to do some of each, in a recent interview, they said they want to play Mayhem, and tour with those sorts of bands, but still also play Warped and tour with those sorts of bands as well"

"To the subreddit","I browse this subreddit a few times a week, mostly just to lurk. But I'd just like to say you all are probably one of my favorite communities on reddit.

Every time I open a thread about someone trying to find new music or related bands that a user might enjoy people are so eager to jump in and help someone out and with respect as well. Almost every time someone says ""Oh I like these bands: X, Y, Z"" they usually come out of it with an entire list of bands to try out.

Nobody bashes anyone for liking one band and another doesn't, everyone has their own tastes and by the looks of it everyone here understands and respects that.

Also, it seems that it has a strong potential to bring people together, if someone mentions a show it seems like a really good possibility at least *someone* that comments in the thread might have been at the same show.

Keep it badass guys, love it.

P.S. Also something I should have mentioned is that the Mods are on top of it and really active... great work fellas."

"To the subreddit","How do you like it compared to Number[s]?

Deciding whether to give it a good listen or not and I liked the older one. Is it very different without Tyler and Michael?"
"To the subreddit","It's definitely not as good as Number[s], but I'd give it a shot. Yeah, it's different without Tyler and Michael. I'm quite a fan of Tyler's replacement, Hance. Michael's replacement (Doriano I think his name is) isn't as good, though. I feel like it could have been anyone and it wouldn't have made a difference. "
"To the subreddit","Sweet I will give it a jam tonight. I keep hearing good things about Hance so I must check him out. I've been told that Number[s] is highlights Bohn, meanwhile Issues highlights Carter more. Is this fair to say?"
"To the subreddit","Very fair to say. I think that Michael is criminally underused in Issues' Self-titled. If you'd like a delicious WIM middle-ground, there's always [Vengeance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXOaYKfnQSk), which has Hance and Michael. "
"To the subreddit","I just gave this a listen (for the first time) very very nice, Bohn delivers as always. Hance surprised me. Is he doing anything these days?"

"To the subreddit","Personally, I loved it. One of my favorite albums."
"To the subreddit","I love Number[s] a lot but I still enjoy Genesi[s]. I enjoy Number[s] more in part because I like Michael Bohn better than Doriano and I enjoy the speed in Number[s] a lot but when it comes to being genuinley angry and catchy Genesi[s] does a really good job. Also I like Hance Alligood more than Tyler Carter so there's that too. "
"To the subreddit","Thanks for the reply! I'm a mega Tyler fanboy so I'm now intrigued to see what Hance sounds like :D

edit: any suggestions on the album to start with?"
"To the subreddit","No problem! I like Tyler a lot too which is why I'm also in love with Issues but after I heard Hance on Vengence and then his stuff with Oh, Manhattan (realy good btw he puts out so much emotion in his cleans and screams) I was hooked. Hmm hard question, personally I'm an advocate of just going beginning to end but specifically I Told You Once is great and heavy, Nothing Left To Lose and the acoustic version are good, The Walking Dead, and A Story To Tell are all good fun songs."
"To the subreddit","I'll smash out the whole album after work (10:40am here on a Monday...) Cheers man!"

"To the subreddit","I wish I had a similar experience. This is a genre I assumed would have created a close-nit community with the general themes of these bands, but I find more of a divide between people getting hung up on genres and categorizing bands into neat little boxes. Calling this artist ""post-punk-rock-hardcore-numetal"" and others saying they're ""post-punk-popcore-metal"". I get the most now out of being a lurker to see what's new and what people are saying about the new music.

Never imagined I'd see Periphery as the banner of this subreddit, so props for that."

(I know I used to contribute a lot to the annoying ABR jerking, so I apologize, I've been trying to cut back on that, they're just one of my favorite bands, so I have a tendency to mention them whenever I feel they're somewhat relevant)"
"To the subreddit","Honestly though, ABR deserves it. They're one of the best bands in the genre, hands down. Just saw em again a couple weeks ago and was once again blown away that their live shows are so good, they make their albums almost seem like bootleg ripoffs"
"To the subreddit","I don't see how it's ""jerking"" as long as it's relevant"

"To the subreddit","I play guitar a bit just for fun, vocals are my main thing though"
"To the subreddit","I don't think I've ever seen an anti-ABR jerk. Unless the anti-ABR jerk is the whole effort to tone down the ABR jerk, then I see it"
"To the subreddit","Well, I've just noticed a lot of hate on ABR simply because they're jerked a lot on this sub"

"Can you scream? How did you learn?","Really it's just learning the right techniques (scream from your diaphragm, not your throat, make sure to warm up first and drink water so your throat doesn't dry out), and then practicing a lot"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","How can you tell if you scream through your throat and not your diaphragm?"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","If you're screaming from your diaphragm, you should feel your stomach tighten and your throat won't hurt"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","Yeah I don't think I do that, haha"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","Ah, might want to fix that then"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I've been doing it since I heard about Matt Tuck's throat problems years ago. There was an article in Kerrang magazine that said he'd been to a vocal coach and that made me look into vocal training for metal. Nowadays most screamers put up tutorials on youtube but I find they tend to say the same things. I'll list a few of the common ones.  
  
1. Warm up. There's good videos online but you should warm up your throat before screaming as with all singing. I tend to hum scales and then low sing them but there's loads of ways to do it.  
2. Know your range. Not everyone can do everything, most of my highs sound like shit, especially if my voice isn't on top form so I stick to a lot of lows. You can really hurt yourself over exerting your voice to be trying to hit notes you can't do as it takes serious training to be able to do all, some naturally can but it's rare.  
3. Hydrate. Simple, but once your throats dry screaming gets terrible.  
4. Rest. Once your voice starts to hurt, rest it. Same as any part of your body, you will seriously fuck it up if you push it while it's in pain.  
5. Practice. If there's a particular type of screaming you're trying to do, practice at it. Eventually you will get there, but it takes time to learn techniques of voice modulation.  
6. Breathe. You need good breathing for good screaming. All good roars come from the chest, not from shredding your vocal cords. Breathe deep, and try to breathe through your nose a lot, clear airways are important and breathing in through your mouth can dehydrate.  
  
There's more but youtube and google are your friend here, a lot of deathcore vocalists put tips up, ask if you have any specific questions?"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","This. 100% this. [Way to go, bing-bong.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnMalCuytHA)"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","Just practicing and getting the hang of a basic level of screaming (at whatever your most comfortable range is) is the biggest, as far as sounding good and being able to sing songs I mean. It's not super intuitive at first, and you'll initially get a basic technique but not really something you can do much with.

But as you get more and more used to utilizing the correct vocal control it becomes a great deal more natural. After a little while the execution becomes second nature and you can more easily experiment with different areas of range. Don't try and go crazy all over the place from the get-go. 

Breathing is what impresses me a lot with some vocalists. Some of those parts require a great deal of breathe. "
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","This is a solid set of tips!

I usually just scream for the fun of it (like scaring people lol) or along with the music, but it's definitely important to know how to do it right!"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","Also, use your diaphragm, is something I see everywhere. And its true. Push with your diaphragm, not throat."
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I thought I tore a vocal cord the other day singing Attila in the car. So no, I'd say I can't"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I burst a blood vessel in my eye singing a long to Writing on the Walls the other day. I suddenly felt a pain in my eye and looked in the mirror and saw the red. I don't know if I should try anymore."
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","that's brutal"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I sing along to Writing on the Walls all the time, now I'm worried...was it during the ""WE WALK ALONE"" bit?"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","Haha I can't remember exactly when, somewhere in the middle, it may have been that."
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","That part used to screw up my voice all the time before I got used to screaming, lol."
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I watched a shitload of Youtube tutorials and then kept trying until I found the right technique (that didn't hurt my throat--this is crucial. If your throat hurts at all while scremaing, stop immediately and rest for a day or so. Don't even risk damaging your vocal chords.) and then I just practiced by screaming along to my favourite bands. Also drink LOTS of water."
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","[Check out Ryan Strain's tutorial!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrSXmRutALs)"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","This.  Ryan Strain knows his shit."
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","Yeah I can, I do it averagely but what I found is that I'm quite limted as my voice is deep as so my highs don't sound right and I learnt from a friend in a band and youtube clips but to be honest I'm not fully aware of the techinque I use as its become second nature, watch heaps of clips and PRACTICE lots as that matters a lot, you will start off shit and be shit for ages haha"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","Kinda, I never put too much time into practicing since it's nothing I would ever really do outside of singing(screaming) along with songs, pretty much just have the basic fundamentals down after doing it on and off for like 2 years"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I got started when I put on some loud music and let 'er rip. As I became more and more comfortable with the sound I looked into refining my technique and have settled into a nice and brutal false chord sound."
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","Melissa Cross &amp; The Zen of screaming. 1 &amp;2"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","Yeah I can, not too well though. I just learned from youtube tutorials. 

Quick crash course: 

Do the batman voice, or like a long drawn out sigh of exasperation. Then do it harder and lower. Boom, false-chord/growl.  

Now bark like a pit bull. Like ""Ruff!"" or ""roof"" or whatever. Push that sound, and make it higher or lower. That's a mid false chord. 

Fry screams? Make the Marge Simpson groan noise. Open your mouth. Thats a fry scream. 

These will all sound like shit when you start, but keep practicing. Always practice, every day, but don't hurt yourself. If it hurts, stop. 

Also being good at singing will help, and vice versa. So get decent at singing (breathing, volume control, stuff like that) and you'll probably be able to scream better or have an easier time learning."
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I've been screaming for a few years now, and it really comes down to having your screams come from your core (diaphragm), and make sure you warm up well before you tear shit up. Once you learn how to properly, it is a blast. "
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I can. I have been doing vocals since i was 15, i am 18 now. I can't tell you anything about it that has not been covered earlier in this thread. I only got 1 advice for you that i got from a friend, [you may know him from youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4IZ9Xz13BU). He says ''If you wanna scream, then fucking scream. You need to have kind of a *dont give a fuck* attitude about it.'' This helped me quite a lot. I suggest you just try to make some sounds, don't try to scream along to your favorite songs right away. Try to see if you can create some screams or growls before you started covering songs. Good luck buddy
"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I don't know exactly how I do it, but I do high and low death growls, kind of like Mitch Lucker. the way I would describe it is like the noise you make when you're trying to cough up phlegm, but you concentrate the sound to your liking."
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","Same rules everyone is saying. use your diaphragm not your throat, and if your throat hurts stop. 

But I basically put on Young and Aspiring by UnderOath and tried to sound like Spencer. I mean I don't sound like him at all but it did teach me how to do it. And then you develop your sound as you go. I've started getting more into hardcore so now my scream has a bit more of a yell sound to it. "
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I'd like to think I can. I actually starting out doing growls first as they're less intense to perform and less straining on your vocals cords and in general come easier.   
 
While practicing the growls for a year or so I learned about proper breathing, warming up and projecting my voice.  
 
With my growls improving my clean vocals also improved a lot, I should note that at the beginning I had no clue how to sing at all, i sung flat, emotionless and without any volume.  
  
My screams actually came after all that, about 3 years into being a vocalist. The way I scream is basically combining my head voice with a rasp/distortion. I believe it's a similar technique to what Chester Bennington uses, but right now I sound more like Caleb Schomo, the whole technique is still kind of new to me.  
 
Some safe tips I can probably give you are:  
* Learn about proper breathing technique.    
* Learn about warming up your voice. Top athletes don't try to set a new record without warming up their muscles and neither should you.  
* Practice a lot, but don't practice to the point where it hurts. In my first 2 years I practiced an hour a day divided into 2 segments of 30 minutes (driving from home to work worked wonders).  
"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","Get the fundamentals down, no one can tell you exactly how to do it, because everyone has their own style.  However, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9MPYY7vtrQ) helped me get the the basics which eventually helped me build my unique sound.  I can now say, after a few years of practice, that i have perfected the high fry scream and low growl, with minimal to no discomfort.  I'm still working on managing my air, however i can keep the high scream for a decent amount of time, coming close to the likes of Austin Carlile's scream up-times from [old Attack Attack!.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y3_L6NFBjs)

Also, another tip i would give is find a vocalist you like, and try to mimic their scream sound.  While you aren't trying to copy it, hearing it allows you to adjust the sound, and kind of get a feel for the type of screams you prefer to do.  Also, you always need a goal to strive for, so saying something along the lines of ""I'm going to practice till i sound like him"" is also a good way to measure your progress.  Again i want to stress that there are ALOT of techniques for screaming and that these are just the things that helped me get the sound i wanted.   "
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I'm not so good anymore, but i watched a shitload of videos on youtube and i have torn my voice several times doing shit improperly. 

My main enemy is confidence, i sound like shit when i sing, scream, or even talk without confidence. Just tell yourself that you CAN do it, and try not to think about it too much"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I learned for the reason you mentioned, because I wanted to sing and scream along with my favorite songs. Everything /u/TheStormCallsYou said is pretty much spot on, also I'd like to add that if you have asthma like me make sure you take your inhaler at least 15 minutes before you warm up. And take it once more than what's recommended on the box, opens your lungs up so much better "
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","Trial and error to find a way I didn't fuck up my throat"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I find my highs are great, I can low exhale okay, (think  ADTR) I just can't exhale gutteral, I'm slowly getting better. But I can throw some old school Chelsea Grin inhales, I feel brutal covering Crewcabanger xD"
"Can you scream? How did you learn?","I taught myself how through various YouTube videos &amp; written tutorials back when I was like 14 or 15. As others have said, it's all about the diaphragm."

"In Hearts Wake secret project?","Northlane just put the Skydancer website up on their Instagram, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/2wv6jb/secret_booklets_in_northlane_and_in_hearts_wake/) post kinda has some info linking the two bands. I'm pretty fucking hype, to be honest.
"
"In Hearts Wake secret project?","They released a song called Skydancer last year and all the proceeds went charity. It might have something to do with that. "
"In Hearts Wake secret project?","Never listened to these guys.  Out of curiosity I just checked them out on youtube.  I can already tell I'm gonna be spending a lot of money on these dudes.  I love this subreddit."
"In Hearts Wake secret project?","Yeah man if you like Parkway then check out this one!

"In Hearts Wake secret project?","Ohh shit.  I'm so pumped now.  Haha, thanks dude."
"In Hearts Wake secret project?","there's a reason their newest album won best metal album on iTunes"

"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","To be honest, my least favorite band on the Frozen Flame tour, but that's not saying much! These guys do go hard, especially their old stuff. Maybe they'll change my mind on Saturday"
"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","I had the same opinion but they killed it on the frozen flame tour. I saw them in Sacramento and they really brought the energy "
"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","I've seen live videos and I do think I'll enjoy them live. Can't wait!"
"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","Haven't seen them since they toured with TDWP and don't like any of their stuff past Monuments but I saw them at Sac as well and they really got me into it. My friend told me Levis vocals were in the way out but he sounded really good. And  I loved that they threw in some older songs as well. "
"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","Yeah I have pretty much the same opinion about them. I went with the idea in my mind that I was just going to get in the pit a bunch for their set and have as much fun as possible. I thought Levi did a good job on the vocals too, overall it was super fun "
"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","I think you'll enjoy their set, they sound great live and they play a lot of their older stuff on this tour"
"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","Yeah I think I'm going to like it too. I listened to some of the newest album and thought the production was horrendous, but I like Apologies... a lot. I'm really excited this is my 2nd time seeing August Burns Red and I LOVE Northlane and Erra so this is a great tour for me. "
"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","They play 2 songs from the new album, 1 from At Heart, 3 from Monument, and 2 from Apologies. Monument is my favorite from them, so I was pretty happy with that"
"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","I felt the same way before I saw them, and my mind was totally changed. I was really surprised at how good they sounded and the amount of energy the had. "
"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","They were great when I saw them, and to be honest I don't like any of their albums at all. I enjoy one or two songs by them on CD, but live it's definitely a different experience."
"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","man, this album was the BOMB, but the dropped the ball big time on the new album, especially the screams, absolutely HORRIBLE."
"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","While I liked this album more, I actually thought the new album was pretty good. Sure, the screams weren't the best, but I enjoyed the album overall"
"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","Saw them last night on the Frozen Flame Tour, they killed it. On a side note, whoever did the sound engineering for ABR needs to be shot. Vocals were way too low and lead guitar way too high. "
"Miss May I - Masses of a Dying Breed","They sounded fine when I saw them"
