"Gonorrhea Pussy?","I'm not really into death metal. I enjoy some of the old favs now and then--more of a jazz, blues, reggae guy most of the time. 

Recently I stumbled across a group called Gonorrhea Pussy, and I must say I'm a bit entranced. Once you get past the completely obscene name, the music is incredible. I've never heard anyone sing in such a deep, guttural way. It's inhuman, like an anthropomorphic pig chanting into a gutter. Songs usually have an introduction of women screaming in pain, ripping sounds, Japanese men speaking cruelly. While the music itself is nothing special, everything coalesces into a truly pleasurable mind fuck. 

I can't find much info on this band. Anyone know anything about them?"

"Infernal Runes","The Devil came to me in a dream, wreathed in a cloak of flames, flanked by a pair of scantily clad succubi, and he said unto me:

*""I need you to design a set of runes, with thorns and blades, and spread them among those that rock.""*

And with that he gave me a wink, and left me with a pair of succubi for the remainder of the dream.

Upon waking, I went forth, and with fevered inspiration, I came up with a set of cards to be used in divination. 

Thus birthed the unholy creation:

http://www.nationaldayofprayer.org/

Thanks to support and enjoyment around the world, the National Day of Slayer is now the INTER-National Day of Slayer, and it happens every year on June 6 starting at hour six. On this day, metalheads worldwide stop the pointless activities of a boring world and listen to Slayer.

International Day of Slayer is bigger than one nation, or even one band. It's a celebration of metal music through one of its most articulate spokesbands. It's also revelry in the spirit that makes metal great. So on June 6, stop everything... and listen to SLAYER!

now i've got to figure out what each station is etc...

also the fact they got rid of the only punk/hard rock/ska station is very annoying."
"Anybody else pissed that Sirius Hard Attack has replaced XMLM?","I think they did it with all of the ""rock"" stations.  
They pretty much got rid of their 'true' metal station.   Hard Attack is essentially the 'hard rock' station with twice as much Metallica.  It sucks because XMLM actually played a good mix of old and new metal across all of the subgenres.

"New death metal listener","I am a new death metal listener. I like the genre. I play the guitar so I know how to appreciate the guitars and other instruments. The gbiggest concern that I have is that how do I appreciate or understand the lyrics.  If anyone could help it would be great. Just to give you some idea. I am in love with the new vallenfyre album ""splinters"". I understand doe lyrics from it. I also tried to listening to from ""enslavement to obliteration"" but I didn't really understand the lyrics. Any help would be great. Thanks"
"New death metal listener","There’s two ways to answer this question depending on what exactly you’re asking. 

If you’re trying to pick out the lyrics from listening to the vocals, good luck. Many are completely incomprehensible without the written lyrics. As you listen more (and listen while reading) you should start to develop something of an ear for it, but frankly the words themselves are usually secondary to the rhythm and texture of the vocal line. Rather than trying to pick out words to sing along with, like you would in a pop song, pay attention to the flow of the vocals, where they are prominent and where they rest, etc etc. If you’re a musician, think about it not like a sung vocal line but rather another instrument layered into the music. In most death metal that’s worth your time, the vocals do not lead the song but comment on it, so it can be one of your lesser concerns in appreciating the music.

If you’re asking how to appreciate and explicate the lyrics (which is what I think you’re getting at), the answer is a little more complex. First, it’s important to understand how metal uses symbolism and what songs tend to be about in a subtextual sense. Lyrics about demons, serial killers, warfare, etc are the norm, but why? One of the biggest differences between extreme/underground metal and rock/pop music is going to be important here. Pop music is about the individual experience: “I’m heartbroken” or “I’m in love”, or “my friends and I are going to party this weekend”. Even most political rock songs (i.e. punk) tend to be protesting specific issues: “this war is bad”, “the government is doing X to its citizens” (it’s worth mentioning here that Napalm Death is a grindcore band, and lyrically rooted more in hardcore punk and crust than most death metal).  Heavy metal, from the earliest days of Black Sabbath, tends to avoid this. It frames the individual in the context of greater and larger forces of history, society, mythology, etc. Rock has always celebrated the individual (typically positive aspects), where metal examines the larger composition of reality and is not afraid to acknowledge the negative or “evil” aspects of existence. 

What this means is that you should approach the lyrical content of death metal the same way you approach a horror movie, or Gothic literature (a form of Romanticism). In fact, it is extremely common for metal lyrics to reference or be directly inspired by this sort of art, and tends to function in a similar way, and being well-read and well-watched will enrich your understanding immensely. The works of modernist/Gothic author HP Lovecraft explore the notion that humanity is a very small and insignificant part of a reality that is horrific and incomprehensible to us and is ultimately not under our control—stories like “The Call of Cthulu” and “The Rats in the Walls”. Horror/exploitation movies such as “The Last House on the Left” force us to confront aspects of humanity and ourselves that we would often rather ignore like torture, rape and revenge. George Romero’s original “Night of the Living Dead” partitions its cast into two groups: those who can deal with the terror they face and those who cannot. Mary Shelly’s masterpiece “Frankenstein” explores the morality and ethical pitfalls of science (and its connections with the alchemists of ages past) and the existential dread of being alone in an indifferent universe. We could go on forever: Milton’s “Paradise Lost” and its casting of Satan as an anti-hero; Robert E. Howard’s Conan the Barbarian; works of philosophy by men like Crowley, Jung or Nietzche; Tolkien in its entirety; religious or esoteric works like Norse mythology, Gnosticism, chaos magick, etc etc etc. 

Metalheads have a reputation of being brash, uneducated thugs, and this is very unfair. A lot people who are very involved with underground metal are intelligent, well-read persons, who desire to explore and understand the world around them rather than escape it. While the lyrics of death metal may deal with fantastic or fictional topics, they are usually less escapist than your average popular music. As such, if you want to understand what metal is about (and importantly, WHY), you need to get in a similar mindset. Though they are sometimes derided for being too elitist, the Death Metal Underground (linked in the sidebar) has some very good articles along the lines of what I’ve said above.

Finally, since you say you’re a new listener here’s a short list of high-quality metal songs with good lyrics that you can get to work unraveling:

-Celtic Frost “Circle of the Tyrants” (the struggle of modern man to create something greater than the petty individual) 

-Slayer “Chemical Warfare” (warfare framed as a mythological Satanic war, basically an updated version of “War Pigs” by Sabbath)

-Morbid Angel “Fall From Grace” (taken straight from Milton’s “Paradise Lost”)

-Immolation “Nailed to Gold” (was the suffering of Jesus a sacrifice to save our souls…or something else?)

-Deicide “Dead by Dawn” (don’t make me explain this one!)

-Unleashed “Onward into Countless Battles” (remember when Scandanavia was the home of the Viking hordes? Unleashed does)

TL;DR: Metal is not about individual experience. It’s about reality, the “big picture” and not ignoring the unpleasant parts of life. It’s also much more literary than pop music, and if you want to understand it properly you need to be versed in history, literature, and mythology. If you want to be able to understand the words while they’re being said…you might want to listen to something else.
"
"New death metal listener","Thanks. Greatly appreciated. "
"New death metal listener","&gt; how do I appreciate or understand the lyrics

Read the lyrics and develop an ear.  The biggest gripe I have with morons who complain about not understanding the lyrics of extreme metal is that they assume lyrics are important. They are using as an atmospheric instrument, just like the guitar.  What is said is often irrelevant. If you want to know what they're saying, learn to decipher what's being said, or read the lyrics. If you think the lyrics need to be appreciated, perhaps you should go listen to some shitty singer singing about shit.

If you think understanding the lyrics matters, then metal is not for you."

"#metalgate zombies want you to like “Christian black metal” now","As a regular reader of deathmetal.org, I'm pretty disappointed by their recent obsession with ""#metalgate"".  I'd say I'm pretty representative of most visitors to their site: I follow a few other blogs and lurk in a couple metal forums, but I'm not the most widely read in current-metal-events.  However: I don't hear about this phenomenon anywhere else on the internet.  Nobody else cares.  Seriously, this obsessive victimization of metal being ""infiltrated"" seems pretty invented.  Yeah, NPR/Pitchfork casual metal listeners might find novelty vegan/feminist/christian/LGBTQ psudo-metal bands a fun novelty and download a record or two before going back to their Fugazi worship.  But nobody who actually listens to metal even knew or cared about those bands to begin with.  Why feel threatened?  Why write several articles every week giving us the latest update on this ""crusade""?"

I know that hardcore influenced metal, mainly thrash, but to say that the roots of death metal are tied to bands like GBH or The Exploited is just fucking retarded.  I can see the relationship between crust and death metal, so I understand your Amebix comparison, but to suggest that Cro-Mags or other NYHC bands influenced death metal's sounds is just fucking absurd. Same with old streetpunk acts like GBH or The Exploited.  Death Metal comes to us via thrash, which in turn spawned out of the same scenes that punk did.  I'd have to be a complete fucking moron to start posting tracks from UK82 records to a death metal subreddit and assume it would be on-topic. The history of death metal has nothing to do with streetpunk like GBH or The Exploited, at least not directly. The foundations of death metal come from thrash and grindcore. Grindcore comes out of the crust scene, which came out of the punk scene, but that would be the equivalent of posting jazz to the powerviolence subreddit because jazz influenced rock influenced punk influenced hardcore influenced powerviolence.  I could understand comparing bands like early Napalm Death, or some Extreme Noise Terror, to death metal.  But GBH? Fuck no. That's just *stupid*.
