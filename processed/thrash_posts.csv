"Red Riot (Thailand): The Day Bangkok Burned","Bangkok-based crossover thrash outfit Red Riot recorded their DIY demo on the same day that the Thai capital descended into internecine warfare on May 19, 2010 when the army launched an assault on insurgent Red Shirt brigades, leaving five dead (including an Italian journalist) and a city in shock. 

""We recorded these songs with the image of burning Bangkok on our minds,"" said the band in the liner notes. ""It might be read as our sonic interpretation of the obscure situation that day due to the government censorship of the news from the frontline.""

The results are chilling. Listen for yourself:

"Not sure if this will be accepted or removed, but this is the earliest song I can think of that sounds like it has that ""Thrash sound.""

"Will thrash ever make a mainstream comeback?","I asked this question to Lars in his AMA and just thought I'd bring it here. I play in a thrash band in an area where it was pretty much nonexistent and we have had a really good response, but do you think it will ever make it back to the national spotlight like it was during the Big 4 era? "
"Will thrash ever make a mainstream comeback?","I don't think it will.
And actually I'm pretty happy it wont.

If it did, it would just eventually lead to lots and lots of black albums.
And i dont want that
I want FUCKING THRASH"
"Will thrash ever make a mainstream comeback?","Yeah, there's enough thrash bands out there that you could listen to nothing but thrash for weeks on end. It's more fun to search out good bands anyway. I don't need the radio trying to tell me what to like by playing the same songs over and over and over."
"Will thrash ever make a mainstream comeback?","nah"
"Will thrash ever make a mainstream comeback?","In ancient times in a galaxy far, far away, thrash was an extreme form of metal. As a member of that scene in the 80s I'm not sure about how I feel about thrash assimilating into the mainstream. "
"Will thrash ever make a mainstream comeback?","it already has. In America, at least. Municipal Waste was on the forefront. "

"Any objections against Thrashcore?","I said say nothing and do nothing, geez! Haha, yeah it was more of a joke about how dead this sub kinda is... I didn't think anyone would mind (or even notice the difference?) if some thrashcore was posted."
"Any objections against Thrashcore?","Yeah I know... I couldn't help it! It's like DO NOT PUSH THIS BUTTON."
"Any objections against Thrashcore?","Seeing as how crossover and thrashcore are the same thing i dont know what you mean"
"Any objections against Thrashcore?","Not according to metal sub-sub-genre super elitists they're not.

It was meant more as a joke. But yeah they're the same thing, as far as I can tell."
