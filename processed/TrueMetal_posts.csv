I'd be real curious of how Leviathan or Twilight would do in this sub, not sure they'd do so well. I'll give it a shot.

New Skull Fist!

Not sure that Dropdead is metal."
"trve fukking metal coming in 2014","Wolvhammer is pretty cool, the fact they keep changing styles a bit from album to album keeps me interested in their future.. went from a blackened crust to a more ""profound lore""-ish sound (longer tracks, more atmosphere and less crust, I guess).  

Since the two Twilight albums were really different, I feel this third and final one should be firing on all cylinders, or at least be interesting."

"Any record collectors here?","Sorry if this is the wrong place to post it but I'm pretty sure most people who list to true metal also collect records. If there is a subreddit for record collecting i couldn't find it.
Here's my collection:

http://imgur.com/a/Oo7oH#0"
"Any record collectors here?","Been looking for Scanner - Hypertrace and Root - Zjeveni for a while myself. Nice collection!"
"Any record collectors here?","I do trades sometimes! Send me a list of what you have and maybe you have something i'm looking for. "
"Any record collectors here?","Just posting to remind myself - I'll check back here at the weekend and PM you once I get back to my collection...Ill do up a list!"
"Any record collectors here?","Sounds good!"
"Any record collectors here?","Do you have a wants list? Because Traveller is right at the top of mine."
"Any record collectors here?","I do have a want list. But there's very few, if any, things I would trade for Traveller."
"Any record collectors here?","Let me know if you see one of those particular LPs."
"Any record collectors here?","..."
"Any record collectors here?","Give me a moment"
"Any record collectors here?","I'll need you to expand the definition of ""Let me know if you see one of those particular LPs.""

Thanks"
"Any record collectors here?","Something you'd want for Traveller."
"Any record collectors here?","There's just tooooooo many."
"Any record collectors here?","To go through, or that you'd want?

Honestly, the only stuff that I'd say I'm 100% against trading are the Desolation Angels LP, Elixir's Son of Odin, Legend's From the Fjords and the Death SS 7""."
"Any record collectors here?","That i'd want.

Traveller is one of my favorite albums, in my top ten for sure so there's very few things i would let it go for. A big one being Blind Guardian's - Banished From Sanctuary 7"". Anything else i would want to trade i either already have or are almost non-existent. Like Killen - S/T and Leader - Out In The Wasteland. And even in those cases it would be hard. "
"Any record collectors here?","No worries, totally understandable. 

Killen pops up from time to time but it's gotten stupid expensive recently. One of these days ..."
"Any record collectors here?","Yea last time I saw that Killen, it was on a sell list for €300"
"Any record collectors here?","Nice collection. I see some of my favorites in there (Bathory, Judas Priest, Omen, Celtic Frost, Running Wild, Tank, etc.). I was actually at a shop today where someone had sold back some decent 80s metal, but it was mostly thrash and that's not my bag. (Plus it's primarily a bookstore and their records are overpriced based on price guides). Still, it's unusual to see Testament, Toxik, etc. records in bins around here.

I've got some decent stuff, but not a collection I'd ever stack against yours.

There is [/r/vinyl](/r/vinyl), but it's overrun with Pitchfork-approved indie rock, people who just inherited their relatives' record collections and people posting cameraphone pics of their latest haul of ""gems"" (read: dollar records) from Goodwill. Occasionally some good stuff sneaks through, but by and large it's a disappointing subreddit."
"Any record collectors here?","Thanks dude. 
Yea i see records in store that don't usually carry them and sometimes i get lucky. I found that Warrant LP for 8 bucks in a book store."
"Any record collectors here?","Yeah, i just started collecting about a year ago, it mainly started when i went to France and raided every single record store i could find (btw if you're ever in Marseilles, there is a metal shop called Sabre Tooth which is probably the best record store i have ever been to.)

I'm at college so i can't take pics of anything (no way would i take my shit to a dorm) but some of the gems i'm rather proud of are:

Depravity - Remasquerade 7""
Adramelech - Spring of Recovery 7""
Arghoslent - Incorrigible Biggotry
Lantlos - .neon

I know there are some i'm forgetting but those are probably the rarest i own atm, i only have a collection of about 45 total.  I did just win an OP picture disk of Silencer's Death-Pierce Me on ebay about 30 min ago, so i'm stoked for that to come in."
"Spotify playlists?","I'm an aging burnout who is having a hard time staying in touch.  Spotify is pretty awesome these days. They don't have everything, by far, but they have a lot more underground music than they did just a year ago.  I'm not super good with it yet, but it seems perfect for sharing playlists of good new albums and bands yet I never see any good playlists when I go looking.

Are there any good magazines, blogs, podcasts, labels or whatever making playlists that you know about?  I like the taste of Zero Tolerance, Maximum Rock N Roll, Cvlt Nation, Hell's Headbangers, Short Fast &amp; Loud and probably a bunch more I'm not aware of.  I see a bunch of ""Best of the Year"" web links recently, but I can't find any playlists on the underground side of things.

Hell I like most of your taste in music, I'd be into it if you guys personally made some playlists for us to check out.  The youtube links are nice, but it would be cool to be able to tag things and whatnot on last.fm

Anyone know if it's possible to make a playlist multiple people could add to? maybe get a TrueMetal meta playlist or something?

Just some ideas."
"Spotify playlists?","I will be working on a new releases playlist every week in 2014, so I'll message you when that starts. It won't be TRVE, as I'm covering heavy music in general, but more of a ""this happened this week.""

I imagine I'll make monthly playlists based on my personal preferences. "

"Folk metal","I have always enjoyed certain folk metal bands. However, I can't understand all that  praise of some bands (popular ones). 

This stuff, for example:
[Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iijKLHCQw5o&amp;hd=1)

Am I deaf? I can only hear some watered down riffs combined with ""folk elements"" that reminds me of something my grandma listens to.
(We call it ""schlager"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlager_music)

And I feel the same way about most popular folk metal bands - Arkona, Korpiklaani. I am interested what you guys think about that. Maybe I am missing something? Too dumb to understand the art of those bands? Here is some folky stuff I enjoy:

"Folk metal","The more a genre becomes popular, the more it begins being overrun with easy selling cliches that appeal to a wider, less demanding audience while having the unavoidable side effect of lowering the quality. Back in the 90's it happened with symphonic black metal (suddenly everybody became a harpsicord wielding vampire); later on, power metal's turn came, with fast high pitches and dragons popping up everywhere. In both cases, the overall quality of the genre was severly damaged, in terms both of new bands coming out sounding quite the same and older acts being forced to chase the this cheapened new wave everybody was so excited about.

Now, it's not all bad: as long as something is able to drag more people into metal, then it's a good thing. It only takes a little more patience to dodge all the shit in order to pick the right bands in some genres, but usually the effort is worth the while"
"Folk metal","Thank you! I really like ""folkier"" folk metal. All too often, you get garbage like your first link. I mean, I know what metal sounds like. And, metal is my favorite genre. If you are going to infuse other genres into metal, at least make it apparent. A lot of ""folk metal"" is a drop of folk in a bucket of metal. Its slightly better than accidentally running across a folk riff every once in a while. The stuff you linked to was pretty good. I would even prefer a bit more folk in my metal, but still pretty awesome."
"Folk metal","I don't think you're ""too dumb""?  I think you just don't care for it.  

Personally, I really enjoy three subgenres of metal:  melodeath (old In Flames, Dark Tranquility, At The Gates, etc.), technical death (Necrophagist, Origin, Hate Eternal, etc.), and folk metal (I love Eluveitie).  

I also really dislike black metal (I find it pretentious) and doom metal (I get bored with it quickly). 

I don't think black or doom metal ""sucks"" or that I'm ""too dumb"" to understand it.  It's just not my bag."
"Folk metal","i liked the first group the most as far as folk metal goes... the instruments give a feel for me along with some cool fables of demons and dragons and ancient lore...not a hardcore fan but certainly prefer folk metal of all metal genres.. thanks for the links"
"Folk metal","Most of the big folk metal bands are as you said: watered down metal with a bunch of folk thrown in.  That being said I do enjoy Ensiferum, they're pretty popular but they're waaaaaaaay better than Eluveitie, Korpiklaani, Arkona etc (imo).  Ensiferum certainly isn't as folky as other bands.  

For other bands you should probably know: Moonsorrow, Windir, Nokturnal Mortum, Primordial"
"Folk metal","Notice, how most of the bands you mentioned in the first paragraph are closer to what they call ""viking"" metal, incorporating death growls with heavily laid folk instruments, and the bands in the second paragraph are what they call ""pagan"" with black metal influences and much less folk instrumentation, relying more on creating the ""atmosphere"" of folk."
"Folk metal","Yeah, Windir is really awesome. "
"Folk metal","For your first link, eluveitie look like it care more about the traditional instrument than the guitar (but in helvetios (their last album) the riffs are better) and if you don't know, inis mona is a ""cover"" of a very famous celtic song (tri martolod)"

"Interesting column by Mike Scalzi [Slough Feg]",""
"Interesting column by Mike Scalzi [Slough Feg]","&gt;Now I know there is no accounting for taste——sure. But is music all so subjective that you can’t even form a coherent opinion about it without being narrow-minded? That’s what people seem to be telling me. I listen to what is considered “music” these days, and my response is almost always the same. If it has any melodic quality at all, or even any rhythmic quality, it’s usually so painfully unmemorable that I could hear the record a thousand times over in a six-month period, and on the seventh month not be able to recall even one riff. Sure, I might remember that it sounded “kinda doomy” or “kinda thrashy” due to the guitar sound, vocal style (or the label its on!!), but chances are that’s the only thing I’ll be able to recall."
"Interesting column by Mike Scalzi [Slough Feg]","That column was an expression of my thought I've been unable to make for the last year or two. I'm definitely sharing it with my elitist bandmates.

Some explanation:
For my second year of school I decided to live in the dorms. Somehow I wound up in the music students dorm (I'm not a music major). I thought this was cool.

I met more kids in my life than ever before who were self-professed metal fans. I thought this was cool. Then I listened to what they call metal. Having started with the big four at the beginning of high school, being introduced to prog by DT and Symphony X, and now digging my way through my love of folk, tech-death, and obscure tech-prog, I didn't know how to respond. Their idea of metal seemed to be loud and brutal. Don't get me wrong, those are two key components of metal. But when they're all you have...well, the music you make isn't metal.

tl;dr Met a bunch of posers last year who showed me what the kids think of metal these days."

"16 year old metal musician","Hello Reddit, my name is Jeff Seabolt, and I am a 16 year old metal musician whose biggest dream is to just get my music out there and gain a following. No, this is not going to be JUST a self promotion post. First, let me tell you a little about my self. 

I started playing guitar at a very young age because of my dad inspiring me to.The very first song I ever llearned was, of course, smoke on the water by deep purple. I was so proud of myself, until one day, my dad told me about a band called ""Metallica"" which is what started me being really serious on guitar. I played Metallica covers for years until I turned 13, which is when I decided to come up with my own stuff, and also screw around with music production software (at the time, audacity lol). Anywho, ever since then, ive been improving and improving and finally, I would say I am at a professional level. 

My equipment so far is:
Guitars: BC Rich Warlock, Dean ZX, Fender American Telecaster
Interface: Line 6 UX1
Computer: HP 2000 (getting a new one soon)
Software: Reaper DAW, POD Farm 2.5 platinum (for guitar and bass), and for drums, Kontakt 5 with Steven Slate, and also Superior Drummer.

"Infernö - Alcoholocaust","One of the main players in Inferno, Carl Michael, was also the drummer/main creative force in the avante garde BM band, Ved Buens Ende, but also, what is much lesser known was that he was the an original member of Satyricon but only plays on the very first demo All Evil, and left the band because they weren't evil enough. Then forms Ulver, only plays on the first demo, leaves the band because they weren't evil enough. He's kinda like Norway's Paul Ledney. IMO, his work with both of those bands is some of their best material. His influence to the songwriting is instantly evident if you are familiar with VBE.

"Are there any good metal podcasts that you like on itunes?","I don't keep up with new bands or albums much these days, and most the metal podcasts I see play the same old or popular bands every metal radio show plays. 

I listen to the maximum rock &amp; roll podcast to keep up with new punk, but I'm sorta in the dark about what's been going on in current metal.  I checked out the Hell's headbangers podcast a while back, I liked the type of bands they were playing but they aren't on itunes so I know I'll never remember to download more. 

Have any suggestions?"
"Are there any good metal podcasts that you like on itunes?","I used to run one so maybe this is just shitty self-promotion or whatever but I think we did a good job of keeping things varied. We were called [The Hand ov Doom] (http://www.metal-injection.net/hand-ov-doom). My goal with the show was to base each episode on some theme that brings a lot of different bands together. Sometimes it was lyrical content, sometimes musical. If you like it let me know what you think! Cheers!

EDIT: Turns out the podcast has been deleted. Bummer. I have all the episodes...I can soundcloud 'em or mediafire or something if you're really that interested."
"Are there any good metal podcasts that you like on itunes?","Thanks, sounds pretty cool, but I doubt I'd listen to more than one or two.  If you ever post them for another reason put something on TrueMetal and I'll give it a go."
"Are there any good metal podcasts that you like on itunes?","Hellcast is pretty good. It's affiliated with Hells Headbangers. I learned of Hic Iacet from that podcast. Pretty good mix of sub-genres, and lot's of interviews (one with the artist Putrid that I remember). It's available on iTunes. I don't really follow it anymore, but it's definitely a lot better than the slew of shit podcasts with shit bands and shit content."

Check out the one with Vinnie Paul - it takes place right as Hellyeah's first album came out, so you get to hear some cool stories. "

"Samain (Perth, Australia) - Drunk on Holy Blood [Demo cassette rip]","http://www.metal-archives.com/

2min 10 seconds!! 

Maybe its personal but I find it hard not to feel emotional about this track, God damn emotional after the 2min10sec kicks in some real death in battle shit!!!  ..and it just goes on...feel it...

Samain played in Perth, Australia in the mid 90's , released a demo called  *An Leanábh Naomh (Briste)* and an album called *Indomitus* , pretty much broke up and released another demo called *Return to the Natural* ....the rest is dead and lost....

Their gigs and music were always amazing, they had excellent musicians, and the singer/bass player was a deep guy as far as his word and lyrics. For a small town like Perth this band was  too big...but for reality and content , there really was nowhere else....the band was deep, the lyrics and music wasnt trend , it was emotion and culture, Samain was fucking deep...and maybe that didnt sell?

We still have the gems though...and this band is worth some credit. The Demo is the best from my POV, the album...amazing...but Im old school...love it, but I want that striving emotion...

(Album and demo is available online with a Google blog search, well worth it and legal..the band and label they were on are dead) "

 ""Servants of Chaos"" available North America for the first time; pressed on triple vinyl in Europe

Ventura, CA's Cirith Ungol, one of the most underrated bands from the early 80s metal scene, released four albums between 1980 and 1991. Cirith Ungol's catalogue is being celebrated through the release of a collection of rare and live tracks on the 2 CD/1 DVD album, Servants of Chaos. Servants was originally released exclusively in Europe back in 2001 and has finally been pressed in North America and a DVD has been added to augment the already stellar collection of music. The DVD contains an entire, rarely seen live show, shot on November 9th, 1984 at the storied, and now defunct, Wolf &amp; Rissmiller's Country Club in Reseda, CA. The CD/DVD will be available on January 31st, 2012 in North America and on triple vinyl in Europe on November 7th, 2011.

The name Cirith Ungol is pronounced ""kirith ungol"" and is an Elvish phrase meaning ""pass of the spider"", which is something that Lord of the Rings fans will surely recognize. The name is, of course, indicative of the band's fantasy-oriented lyrics, themes and beautiful album artwork.""
"
"Metal Blade will be reissuing Cirith Ungol's 2-disc rarities compilation ""Servants of Chaos"" on 1/31/12 with bonus live DVD","Great news I stumbled upon while looking for something else on their site. I'll finally be able to have a completed Ungol collection without breaking the bank (on CD, sadly, vinyl is another story). Between this, the Bolt Thrower vinyl reissues and releasing the new Devil's Blood album all in January, Metal Blade is on the right track to rectify their falseness of recent years."

"metal and modern classical [x-post from /r/avantgardemetal]","Some metal bands (Opeth, Therion, Dimmu Borgir, et al.) borrow choirs, strings, and operatic vocal lines from classical music.  But has there been any absorbtion of newer (1945-present) styles?  Burzum incorporates some minimialist textures, but are the influences of Anton Webern, Igor Stravinsky, Iannis Xenakis, or John Cage ever felt?  

Are there any bands exploring this aesthetic?  To me, it seems like a natural match.  Both metal and modern classical experiment with unusual song structures and abstract mathematical devices.  While the two genres sound dissimilar *on the surface*, I think there is actually a deep connection.  "

"Arghoslent- Flogging the Cargo","&gt;You're allowed to post grindcore but you'll complain about this post not being ""True Metal"" enough?

I don't know if I'm complaining, but yes, I think it's more important to protect easily-overlooked fakes from becoming part of the canon then it is to exclude obvious outsiders.

&gt;I will never understand the appeal of grindcore.

Beyond a few rather musical releases I tend to agree. Like hardcore, it's so limited that it becomes highly repetitive rhythm music that I frequently confuse with the sounds of my air conditioner, flatulence or passing trucks.

"Nu-metal, is it trully bad? Or metal-heads in general just don't wanna have the ""true"" metal any changed?","I find that it is pretty truly bad.  its mostly formulaic ,it could be recorded by any studio band, and it always seemed to me that they would right one edgy lyric and just keep coming back to that one line like they are really proud of it.  i don't care about vocals, and lyrics much but its a big part of nu-metal.  its just radio poprock  and most all of that is rather turdy.  "

"Is old school metal obscure?","I am not sure if it's just where I am from but all of my friends who are metalheads don't seem to like old school metal bands very much. I mean sure, some people dig Metallica and a lot will pretend to like Slayer but that's the extent... 

Normally with this kind of music and just lo-fi metal in general, it's not really accepted by the mainstream community or at least that's how I've seen it. I only got into searching for classic thrash, black, death, doom, etc bands when I neared the end of high school. Even now when I show stuff to people, they just don't seem to really get it. Some of the more narrow minded guys who try to be metal as fuck won't listen to anything except Lamb of God and Pantera (Ugh). I mean I got into punk on the basis that I just wasn't into technical stuff and I still find that the old school classics are more receptive to that crowd. 

Have people's production standards changed? Does the current generation of metal fans just expect complexity and pristine recordings? I want to think not because punk and metal come from the same root. I grew up in a small town so our exposure to metal was a slow process so I figure that might have something to do with it but now that I live in the city and I'm in a music program, I still feel like the odd one out when it comes to this type of metal.  "
"Is old school metal obscure?","I have a group of about 6 friends. Between the 7 of us, we play in a few different bands--a death metal band, a doom metal band, and a punk band. I'm super into trad metal, NWOBHM, old school thrash, old school death, etc. My tastes have always leaned towards the older sound, I don't know why. The other dudes always give me a hard time when I wear an Angel Witch shirt to our shows when they're all wearing Abominable Putridity or Aborted shirts or whatever. I think it's hilarious, especially when you realize that the old school stuff is responsible for everything else. Without the early pioneers, we'd never have the extreme stuff. "
"Is old school metal obscure?","I feel the same way-ish, but (and I'm really trying not to sound hipster here, sorry), I kinda feel more that way as some of the 'trad' bands like Iced Earth, gamma Ray whatever... I think they're pretty mainstream if that makes sense? 

I think it's because of my age more than anything. I'm 37, and being a teenager/early twenties in the 90s meant that there really wasn't a huge amount of good metal around, or at least you had to search for it. By around 2000 it was coming back a bit, festivals like Wacken were starting to really be noticed, and those were the guys that were headlining a lot of the time. 

I tend to think of 'obscure' trad metal to be bands like Doomhammer, Quartz, Preying Mantis and stuff - the second and third tier early 80s bands that would turn up on 'metal for muthas' Vinyl collections - a fair bit turns up on /r/headbangtothis too. 

For me, even though the songwriting isn't always as amazing as their larger contemporaries, or they aren't the heaviest, I think that a lot of those bands really embrace the sheer, wonderful lunacy of metal. They're hilarious and over-the-top, but that doesn't mean they aren't serious either, they just embrace it and push things to their logical extent. I always loved a lot of Thrash for the same reason. For me, that sense of heart and love of the music that makes you want to headbang *instinctively* is what metal is all about, and you don't need to be super-technical to do it, you've just got to be... true metal! "
"Is old school metal obscure?","I definitely think age plays into it. I'm only 21 so my generation was exposed to a lot of processed music. Not that it's bad but I believe we simply lost appreciation for rawness. Genres like black metal (my favourite sub-genre) sound best in a lo-fi environment usually but it's more of a joke among my peers that I'm the black metal guy because they haven't really experienced the intensity of the music."
"Is old school metal obscure?","I guess that's probably true - I do remember when the NWOSDM came along in the 90s and it was excellent, bands like In Flames, Dark tranquility and Arch Enemy's early stuff was great but less processed than those bands sound now - there's definitely a touch of Linkin Park on the new In Flames album - it's just gotten more processed over time and I think that's kind of a shame as it's lost a lot of its individuality because of it. I guess you need to work your way up to really raw black stuff! I kind of came in through iron maiden, got into thrash then death, then black... and ended up listening to bands like Watchmaker or stuff like Merzbow, so there's a progression, but it seems like maybe there isn't the chance to do that organically as much anymore, weirdly because you can get hold of almost anything really easily, you might be less likely to mail off to Belgium for an obscure doom demo (Or possibly I'm just a weirdo who still does that sort of thing :)"
"Is old school metal obscure?","I see a little bit of appreciation for old stuff but honestly among my peers and whatever shell of a metal scene exists in my city, I just don't find anything in common with most people. "

Well put. I always try to explain this to people when they say how cheesy my album collection is. 

"
"Is old school metal obscure?","Agreed! I once went to a festival and in order to limit how many albums I bought, I made a rule that I'd only buy if it had a picture of a dude with an axe on the front. I bought 27 albums that weekend( oh, and Iron Angel are an awesome band by the way;)."

"Is old school metal obscure?","'you only like the good stuff, elitist'
I like to listen to shitty ass fake piss-willy metal because I'm not an elitist like you."
"Is old school metal obscure?","I feel as though traditional heavy metal is still alive.  You just have to look hard for it.  Bands like Iced Earth, 3 Inches of Blood, Varga, and many others keep the spirit of metal alive and well. 
Take my band for instance, we're just a bunch of Judas Priest nuts coming together to make music that (surprisingly) sounds like Priest. 
Metal has unfortunately deteriorated over the years in terms of the quality of music.  The audio quality is great, but the music itself is so generic and bland.  You're not alone my friend.  Metallica, Slayer, Maiden, Priest, W.A.S.P., Megadeth, and Anthrax will always be my favourites. "

"Is old school metal obscure?","Fallen Empire is releasing amazing work. "
"Is old school metal obscure?","Yes the production standards changed a lot. In HM the apparition of numeric era was a big step. From now on musicians had tools that could avoid to spend hours recording but also allow them to cheat a bit. Lately i was reading some article from Neudi's official fb page (Drummer in Roxxcalibur and Manilla Road and sound engineer) and this guys is just an encyclopedia , he tell much about the differences between 80' band and metalheads and today scene vision of it, as he've been a witness of its changes through time. And one of the subject he spoke about was, are the numeric tools reducing the general quality of music (metal here) as drummers use trigger and guitarists use simulation amps, and sequencer that allows to record a track in several times and not in one shot as it was back in time , etc , etc ... He sometimes slip into total subjectivity but i think it's assumed and besides of that, is informations are always quite relevant ! Check for him if you want to know more !"
