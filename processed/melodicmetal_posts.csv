"Issues with formulaic song writing?","Every genre suffers from it, but not every band does. A friend pointed me to Dragonforce and the production is impressive, but am I the only one who sees staggering formulaic writing in it? Just wondering if I am not seeing the finer details or if this band is indeed repetitive sounding."
"Issues with formulaic song writing?","My understanding is that their reputation is largely based on generally cheesy songwriting paired with outrageous guitar wankery. They can pull off some pretty blazing fast solos in the studio and they're actually quite fun to listen to, but you're not going to find a lot of depth in their songwriting. Their recent album ain't bad though. Here's a funny video for ya Dragonforce Greatest Hits: http://youtu.be/SQSGVGTepSg"
"Issues with formulaic song writing?","That's hilarious. That is actually exactly what it sounded like listening to an entire album."
"Issues with formulaic song writing?","For me, DragonForce is a band with a gimmick and nothing else. Nothing they offer interests me."
"Issues with formulaic song writing?","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5iHeg_dPY

Dragonforce were well thought of in the power metal scene before 'Guitar Hero' and many power metal bands suffer from self-plagiarism, formulaic approaches and cliché. Some are honestly better for it. The problem is perhaps more apparent for Dragonforce simply because they're more well known. 

Sounding like they did in 2006 brought them stratospheric and unheard of success for a power metal band in the UK (with Sabaton the only band repeating it since), so it's natural that they would try to replicate that sound. "
"Valhalla - ""In Her Eyes""",""
"Rage - Don't You Fear The Winter [Live 1988]",""
"Rage - Don't You Fear The Winter [Live 1988]","The blatant fakeness of everything in this (around 2:00 the drummer stops playing) somehow brings me to tears. It's only been 25 years, yet this video looks from Neanderthal.

Anyhow, we are talking about the song which is to Rage what Smoke on the water is to Deep purple, so who cares about the video"

"Chateaux - ""Spirit of the Chateaux""","Great record, just a shame that the following records were marred by not having Steve Grimmett.

I was talking to Steve last Friday and he said he hadn't even heard this record since he sang on it. I have sent him the mp3 mainly to try and get him to put this song into his solo setlist. "

"Ghost - Ritual [Live at Sweden Rock 2011]",""
"Manowar - I Believe",""
"Manowar - I Believe","It's criminal that this song along with Dawn of Battle were left off of 'Warriors of the World'. If you removed 'Nessun Dorma' and 'American Trilogy' and replaced them with those two from the single the album quality on the whole would increase hugely."
"Manowar - I Believe","I was hopping they where a teaser for the new album when I got the single.

For a good year I forgot that they where only on the single and was wondering why the fuck they weren't on my computer after I ripped all my music. I eventually when't looking for Manowar torrents to see if I was missing an album or if they where only on a specific version of Warriors of the World or Gods of War only to find they where on one of the 2 CDs I didn't rip!"
"Manowar - I Believe","MANOWAR!"
"Manowar - I Believe","Eric Adams fucking rules. Easily the most important member of MANOWAR!"
"Manowar - I Believe","I would disagree on the basis of one song, Guyana (Cult of the Dammed). Through ever song you could say that the thing that makes you realize its a Manowar song is either Erics voice or Joeys bass equally. But in Guyana it is ALL the first few bars of the bass during the intro. 

When it comes to being the front man I sometimes wish it was Eric because even though I'm a huge fucking Manowar fan sometimes Joey talking makes me cringe and just wish he would shut up. :P "
"Manowar - I Believe","Joey comes off as a narcissistic meathead with questionable conscience."
"Manowar - I Believe","I would agree with this he is up himself (with good reason hes an epic bassist and has a better physique in his late 50s than most of us have in our teens) and needs to learn a bit of humility and to lay off the over the top warrior talk off stage lol! It's epic when he is doing all that shit on stage (the fact that he didn't do it on stage was one of my main complaints about the latest tour) but when you see him in a restaurant doing it, it just comes across as a bit ""the old mans went a bit loopy"" :P"

"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","I just got the new Nightwish album and I have to say it's my favorite. It's not as brutal as some of their other albums and it's much more symphonic, but I actually like that more. I know their main influence is film music and not metal, so I feel like this is the first ""real"" Nightwish album.

Anyway, as for my favorite track that isn't ""Storytime,"" I have to pick ""I Want My Tears Back."" It's got some good Celtic influence."
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","Scarytale. 

I love that song to death.

And Ghost River for the chorus alone. "
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","I want my tears back.
I can't stop listening to it and the pipes have really grown on me."
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","I think at the moment, my favorite songs are Last Ride of the Day and Slow, Love, Slow.

Overall, this is my favorite album from them, and Anette is a step above Tarja in my books after multiple listening sessions. (unpopular opinion?)"
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","I agree about Anette. Tarja has a great voice, but she never had Anette's passion in my opinion. There are some classic songs that, honestly, I don't think Anette should touch, like Wishmaster or Kinslayer, but there are songs that I think Anette sings way better, like Ever Dream, She Is My Sin, and Dark Chest of Wonders."
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","Also, I feel like Nightwish really went in a direction (starting with Century Child) that didn't mesh at all with Tarja's singing style. Century Child and Once are still fantastic albums, but I can't think of a single song on them (okay, maybe Creek Mary's Blood) that I wouldn't prefer to hear Anette's voice on. "
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","I agree, I really don't see Tarja's vocals playing well at all with this album. 

Besides I want my tears back with the slight to operatic vocals. "
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","Annette is no where near Tarja

One is an operatic singer, the other sounds the same as all the other gothic metal bands, lacuna coil, sirenia etc......"
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","Being operatic doesn't make you a better singer. It just means you are operatic."
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","Which was the nightwish sound


Now they are just the same as lacuna coil sirenia etc...."
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","They sound nothing like those bands. Nightwish's sound is and was symphonic, not operatic."
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","ok"
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","I haven't listened to the album but 'Turn Loose the Mermaids' has the best song title in the history of everything"
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","It's a good one. It's a slower ballad."
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","does this album feature much of Marco? btw glad to see a post here that ISN'T a song on youtube lol, tho i love those too"
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","There's a lot of Marco. He is the only one who sings in the opening track, and he has a lot of parts in at least half the songs."
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","Scarytale for one, he shows up quite often. "

"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","awwwww yeahh thanks guys. After listening to Tarot, decided to see what the fuss was about Nightwish, [wasn't disappointed](http://youtu.be/9QXwNgwUnnk)"
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","For me right now it's a tie between I Want My Tears Back and The Crow the Owl and the Dove. Overall a great album. Probably my second favorite after Once."
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","I Want My Tears Back is probably my pick, after giving it a proper listen."
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","My favorite is Song of Myself.
The poem at the end really gets to me."
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","It would have to be scaretale.
Just the way in which all of the portions interact to bring forth to the ears the delight of the macabre and creepy. I am sure it reminds us all of the fears we had as children covering from circuses. Ah its just a great song, in my opinion at least."
"Favorite track on the new Nightwish album? Don't pick Storytime.","Have only listened through it once, but I have to say that I actually only liked Storytime, or atleast it stood way above the others. Sorry."

"(X-post from [TOMT])A metal song with a keyboard, album cover has an eye and possible tear drop","Melodic metal song that sounds like it has either a keyboard/piano playing during parts of it, and it has a ""sweeping"" style to it (like guitar sweeps, but it's with some other instrument like keyboard/piano like I said), I believe it was a male vocalist, and might have been mostly scream-style vocals. Near the end of the song, the sweeping notes slow down a bit. The picture on it was an eye and might have had a swivel decoration and might have had a tear drop over on the side or something. It was on youtube but got deleted. The picture was mostly blue and grey I think and was probably the album cover. Does anyone know what the song could be?"
"(X-post from [TOMT])A metal song with a keyboard, album cover has an eye and possible tear drop","The cover sounds like [Evergrey's The Inner Circle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/TheInnerCircle.jpg). They play progressive metal, so it might be it."

The musical style is somewhat similar to the one described. However the vocalist doesn't exactly scream."

"Dreamshade - Consumed Future | The most melodic and heart-wrenching metal I've ever heard; very under recognized band","Hm. I mostly agree with you, but I really don't see Dreamshade as a metalcore band. I'm definitely catching the metalcore influence that you're catching, but in my opinion, they're style is predominately melo death.
 
Aaaand now I'm seeing the rule against posting melodic death metal (I swear I read the rules, I just didn't see that last one :p). 

Well anyway, to me Dreamshade distinguish themselves so much from metalcore with their technical melo death-style riffing and soaring melodies, that their style is the epitome of melodic metal. But that's just me. Great insight, though."
"Dreamshade - Consumed Future | The most melodic and heart-wrenching metal I've ever heard; very under recognized band","If you cant sense the heavy metalcore definitions in their songs, you arent listening very hard or you dont want them to be.

Its ok to like other genres, but using them outside of ""how a band sounds"" is stupid.

Personally I hate metalcore because, as the sound of metalcore is defined, I find really boring and often sound like a cheap mimic of In Flames.

But this song is definitely an exception, however their other songs I cant stand."

Twilight + Divine Wings + V = best music they ever made IMO.

Also, the first Star One album was amazing.

"Symphony X - Church Of The Machine (1998)","i liked albums twilight, dw, v, odyssey, and some of paradise lost.  not into their new stuff really.  kinda went in a different direction on their latest 2 albums."
"Symphony X - Church Of The Machine (1998)","Oh yeah, I forgot about Odyssey, that was a great album too. I saw them live in Seattle when they were touring the album back in 02` or something. Was an amazing concert!

Lately, I think their problem is that they almost got too full of themselves with all the hype surrounding the band. They are all phenomenal musicians, world class, no doubt. I think this notion got to them and whether it was pride or just trying to expand their musicianship, an album like iconoclast is just too much of a good thing. Like many professional athletes are told, they need to simplify their game!   

Either way, I'm still a fan for life, I just wish SX would release another album similarly paced to their older material!"
"Symphony X - Church Of The Machine (1998)","yeah...it seemed to happen when they signed with nuclear blast which may or may not have something to do with it.  sx is my favorite band by far.  i also got to see them live when they came to anaheim, california.  there were like 50 people that showed up for the concert.  they were headlining along with iced earth, whom i think played far too long where as sx played far too little and too much off their newest album.  it was still pretty cool though."

"Grave Digger - Heavy Metal Breakdown","Fuck yeah, Grave Digger kicks ass.

I have no idea why they keep getting downvoted when I post em in /metal/"
"Grave Digger - Heavy Metal Breakdown","Most trad stuff seems to sink over there if it's not from a band as hugely popular as Maiden, Priest, Blind Guardian, etc. I guarantee you the only time Grave Digger got more than 10 upvotes over there was because Skuld posted a song that featured Hansi Kursch."
"Grave Digger - Heavy Metal Breakdown","Yeah, black/death metal is a tad over-represented there.
Honestly I don't feel much death metal is that heavy. 
The buzzsaw guitar sound where they are just rapidly playing one chord lacks punch to me.

I figured if they gave it a chance they would love Chris's gruff singing style."
"Grave Digger - Heavy Metal Breakdown","&gt; if they gave it a chance

That's part of the problem - anything that's not instantly recognizable doesn't get a chance."

Anyway, You are welcome to post over here,

"Grave Digger - Heavy Metal Breakdown","Grave Digger isn't always that melodic though.
They are more of a crunchy speed metal band."
"Grave Digger - Heavy Metal Breakdown","can you point a crunchy speed metal track by them? 

I have listened to a couple of theirs tracks, so far they sound post-able over here."
"Grave Digger - Heavy Metal Breakdown","Shit, I would classify the track in this post as crunchy speed metal. Sure, it has a solo part towards the end, but for the most part it is crunchy speed metal. At least that's how I would classify it."
"Grave Digger - Heavy Metal Breakdown","Here's [""Headbanging Man""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC3nIVb06k4) from the same album.

To be honest, I never got into anything of theirs after the first three albums. They got a lot more polished and IMO Boltendahl's voice doesn't suit that kind of material nearly as well."

"Isen Torr - ""The Theomachist""","I really wish that this band could've realised its potential (3 EPs/1 live show,as was the plan). Such a shame that Tony died last year.

The slight consolation is that Solstice are likely to start playing 'Mighty &amp; Superior' live soon as apparently they've been rehearsing it."
"Isen Torr - ""The Theomachist""","Even before Tony died it had pretty much been shelved. I asked Perry about it last month and he said he's always been willing to continue on with it but there's likely zero chance of it ever happening. (*edit Even during the years when Solstice wasn't especially active.)

""Mighty and Superior"" was originally Solstice's ""Englander"" anyways, so I'll bet a beer it pops up on their next album with the original lyrics restored."
"Isen Torr - ""The Theomachist""","I know, but had he still been alive the chances of it eventually being completed were at least 'sort of' there.

I knew it was originally intended for the follow up to 'New Dark Age' but I thought the reason it went on to become part of the Isen Torr thing is that it wasn't 'Solsticey' enough."
"Isen Torr - ""The Theomachist""","Not to get all gossip-y, but considering the falling out Tony and Rich had, I seriously doubt he would have been a part of it had the other EPs happened.

Whether or not it's ""Solstice-y"" enough I wouldn't mind hearing the version Solstice did with Moz Ingram even though Rich swears up down left and right it's inferior to the Isen Torr retooling of it. (And I don't doubt him, simply because of how killer ""Mighty and Superior"" is.)

Speaking of post-New Dark Age stuff, I wouldn't mind seeing ""Bloodfeud"" resuscitated, but I doubt it'll happen. It sounds like the new lineup is writing a lot, and if ""I am the Hunter"" is any indication it'll be a worthy successor to New Dark Age."

On the other hand they did play a couple of songs of this album: Blood Brothers and The Wickerman. Both of these were damn amazing during the concert.

What really boggles me is that they didn't play any song of A Matter of Life and Death. It's such a random decision to ignore an album completely."
"Iron Maiden - Dream of Mirrors [2000]","They played the first four tracks of the album at the show I saw: http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/iron-maiden/2010/knebworth-house-stevenage-england-7bd44690.html"

So preordered as well."
"Kamelot - Sacrimony (Angel of Afterlife) [Official Music Video]","Heard the whole album, its amazing. Will feel good when my album arrives."
"Kamelot - Sacrimony (Angel of Afterlife) [Official Music Video]","Listening to this song gave me the same impression as when I recently listened to the new ""Luca Turilli's Rhapsody"" band. Sure it's the same same music, great sound, wicked production, and precision instrumentation, but it's not the same. This is like Iron Maiden with Blaze Bailey, or Iced Earth with Stu Block (okay okay Stu Block is really good, but he's no Barlow)

For the record this guy is pretty good, but he's no Khan and shouldn't try to sing like him. I'd like to listen to the rest of the album before I can make the judgement. 

"
"Kamelot - Sacrimony (Angel of Afterlife) [Official Music Video]","Had my first listen today.  Mind you, I LOVED Khan-Kamelot.  I've listened to every album with him as the lead a hundred times over.... but...

This album was good, not great.  I thought the same about Poetry, actually.  Neither compared at all in my mind to Black Halo or Ghost Opera.

Mind you, this was only my first listen, and my opinion could change significantly as I listen a few more times."
"Kamelot - Sacrimony (Angel of Afterlife) [Official Music Video]","The best song on an otherwise forgettable album. Kamelot have seriously lost their touch, mainly by straying too far into the symphonic, they're basically an FFM band with a male singer now."

"Manowar - Kingdom Come","Only song I do not like on the entire album, but since we are talking about what we all know deep down to be the greatest album of all time, who cares. "

"Saxon - English Man O' War [2004]","Saxon's best album post-early 80s. Closely followed by 'Metalhead'. The fact that two Germans play on the album is probably a contributing factor, Jörg Michael (Drums) &amp; Chris Bay (Keys/Orchestration) both played on this album.

Rivera did do a very good job live early last year though."
"Malice - ""Sinister Double""","Don't know if they're planning to record anything with Rivera ... here's hoping not, at least.

"Edguy - Ministry of saints","Probably one of the better tracks from their recent output."
"Edguy - Ministry of saints","Mhm, I was surprised it wasn't posted before"
"Edguy - Ministry of saints","FYI : It's not from their recent output. It's from ""Tinnitus Sanctus"" (2009), their latest album is called ""Age of the Joker""."
"Edguy - Ministry of saints","I class that as recent, their recent direction being a loss of power metal elements."
"Edguy - Ministry of saints","But that's a process that already started in 2006 with Rocket Ride ... ah, doesn't matter. I just wanted to add that it isn't chronologically the newest album in their discography, just in case if someone wanted to look them up."
"Edguy - Ministry of saints","Yeah :P

Edguy gig next week for me, woo!"
"Edguy - Ministry of saints","I want to hear the new songs live so badly... but sadly I don't have the time to visit a concert atm. Have fun at the gig!"

"Iced Earth - Dark City",""
"Iced Earth - Dark City","Stu Block is the best thing to happen to this band since pre-9/11 Barlow. Yup I said it, when Barlow came back from being a cop, he didn't have the same emotion as in the past.

But to be fair Block can't touch albums like Burnt Offerings or Dark Saga -- actually not many can.. Barlow was amazing back then!"
"Kamelot-""The Haunting"" live w/ Fabio Lione",""
"Kamelot-""The Haunting"" live w/ Fabio Lione","Tell me how you feel about Fabio and Khan's departure! \m/(&gt;.&lt;)\m/"
"Kamelot-""The Haunting"" live w/ Fabio Lione","Khan was one of my favourite singers ever.

But then I went to this tour, and Fabio did an amazing job.

Poetry for the Poisoned was not a strong album at all.

I'm interested to see who they get as a permanent singer, and hope for another strong album like Epica, The Fourth Legacy, The Black Halo, Ghost Opera and so on."
"Kamelot-""The Haunting"" live w/ Fabio Lione","Oh cool cuz i was planning to see their show in Dallas in September, but wasnt sure if i should. I never even got to see Roy live T.T Poetry was alright but the best two albums by far were Ghost Opera, then Black Halo"
"Kamelot-""The Haunting"" live w/ Fabio Lione","Poetry for the Poisoned is good... But when you compare it to Epica and the Black Halo, it's really not too great... Really I wouldn't mind seeing Fabio take over for Khan... I heard that Rhapsody of Fire is breaking up, so it's a possibility."
"Kamelot-""The Haunting"" live w/ Fabio Lione","Fabio would like to, he's said in interviews.

It's up to Youngblood really, I'm sure they'd prefer an American, if only for logistical purposes. 

Tommy Karevik of Seventh Wonder is another possibility, he was backing vocals on the recent tour, and took over lead vocals for a couple of songs. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYX1GEjnSVs"
"Kamelot-""The Haunting"" live w/ Fabio Lione","hmm Not Bad :Obama Meme Face: i wouldnt mind seeing either of them at the concert in downtown dallas this september ㅅ.ㅅ Quite amped now"
"Kamelot-""The Haunting"" live w/ Fabio Lione","Man, I didn't know that Khan left until now.

Got busy with work lately :("
"Kamelot-""The Haunting"" live w/ Fabio Lione","join the qq-ers on youtube lol Ya it sux but he left because HE wanted to, so we gotta respect that, sad as it is"
"Kamelot-""The Haunting"" live w/ Fabio Lione","yeah, I know how is it when burned out, and exhausted. 

I don't blame anyone about Khan leaving either, sometimes these things happened, and wish him all the best."
"Kamelot-""The Haunting"" live w/ Fabio Lione","Love Khan's voice

Fabio is V good with Rhapsody (of Fire) (or was..!?)

and live , with Kamelot-&gt; saw them a few days ago-&gt;
he was GREAT
"
"Kamelot-""The Haunting"" live w/ Fabio Lione","alright, that's another positive review besides an actual *review* i found online of a show in florida. Looks like im goin as soon as i recieve my bus pass and can get off this damn campus"
"Kamelot-""The Haunting"" live w/ Fabio Lione","oh I can give you an actual review if you want LOL, give me a PM if you want and I can type something up again (the site I posted my review on seemed to not accept my edit yet, so it just has the setlist...)"

"Sabaton - 40:1","Awesome band, Thanks for pointing them out :)"
"Sabaton - 40:1","There isn't enough WW2 themed power metal out there. But then again, it'd be impossible to top Sabaton."
"Sabaton - 40:1","its like trying to be more METAL than Manowar. Impossible.

"Helloween - Mr. Torture","Self-irony. This is the best thing in power metal, and therefore in metal at all. Helloween were already laughing about it all in a time when bands actually used to get credit by taking themselves seriously with all the evilness bullshit. Such brilliant people"
