"Split The Abyss Midwestern Thrash/Death Metal","Going to preface this by saying that I'm in 100% support of you guys continuing this. I'm a huge fan of thrash and death metal and love to hear up-and-coming projects such as yours, so understand that my critiques are coming from a place of wanting you to improve, not from wanting you to stop or feel discouraged. And remember that I am only one opinion among billions.

The vocals: The very first line (""July, 1943 Operation Citadel"") seems to run too long. The phrase pushes into the first and second beats of the following measures. If your music was straight droning death/doom, that wouldn't be such a huge deal, but thrash is an entirely different story. When I listen to thrash, I expect my heartbeat to rise and to be continuously banging my head, even if it's just a slight nodding while sitting in traffic. What accentuates thrash into my head/body wanting to move that way is the congruence of the vocals, drums and guitar/bass hitting the final beat in a measure together. It's almost a palatable resolution to each riff or each measure when that happens. With the vocals in this current rendition, they are actually preventing that feeling because of how much of his phrasing bleeds over into other measures. There's not enough solid closure and transition into the next riffs, so it feels at times as if the riffs really aren't changing and that the vocals are the main attraction (which, in thrash, it usually is not). Perhaps a suggestion would be to not allow the phrases to be drawn out longer than the first beat of the next measure. Hopefully this makes sense. The vocalist will be fine, in my opinion, as long as that can be worked on. The tone of his growls are decent, but if you look in the sidebar for this subreddit, even there you can see ""tempo, abrupt riff changes"". Not sure if they are referencing the same thing I am here, but as I said, drawn out phrasing, extended growls, are hard to place properly in this style of music. It can be done, but for the most part, vocals should be pretty quick, tight phrasing.

The end of the Chorus section is anticlimactic. ""Grind of treads relentless"" seems to end at an obscure point that doesn't accentuate the end of the riff it is being used in. Also, it seems some of the lines are pushed together without much riff-room to breathe, specifically between ""Onward through the smoke and dust"" and ""The mechanized ranks are thrust, Roar of guns endless"". Seems as if these phrases were shoved in to that section just to add words, not to actually accentuate the music.

This section did this relatively well, and perhaps should be looked at as an example: ""Emotionless weapons, the world at war
The burning carcasses of iron beasts
Shock action, Steel melee""

Anyway, when I get the chance, I will add some more. I'm at work at the moment. Hope this helps."

"Gomorrah - Cross Under Fire, can 3 highschoolers from Colorado get some love on this subreddit?","I'll be honest: if you weren't dealing with a subject matter that's been thrashed to death (no pun intended) in the metal genre I'd be more inclined to like it.

At this point, hearing another metal band write an anti-religion song with all the nuance of a sledgehammer is about as exciting as hearing a pop song about love at first sight or a country artist bemoan the loss of his dog and his broken down pickup truck. Sorry."

"Anthrax - Armed and Dangerous (Live 1987)","I saw them quite a few times during this period, from clubs to stadiums. One thing that I noticed, was if they were strictly the opening act, their sound and performance were often horrible. Opening acts usually get boned on sound, but this was beyond that. When they headlined, they were awesome.

I also was much more impressed with Joey when I saw them at the Big 4 in Yankees Stadium. He was definitely uneven back in the day."

"Sodom - cover and tracklisting for new album",""
"Sodom - cover and tracklisting for new album","“The devil is in the detail,” as the old saying goes. Translated to Sodom vocalist/bassist Tom Angelripper’s sharp-tongued and highly critical powers of observation, you might also say: the worst perversions often hide behind seemingly harmless terms. What are we referring to? For example to ‘Katjuscha’, one of twelve hard-as-nails songs which Sodom present on their latest studio album, Epitome Of Torture. After all, Sodom’s ‘Katjuscha’ has little to do with the same-named folk song by Mikhail Isakovsky, but is about the Russian rocket launcher which has been responsible for death and destruction thousandfold. “The Katjuscha has been produced since World War II and is still used today,” the Sodom frontman explains. “It’s been responsible for the death of more people than Stalin’s organ. To name such a deadly weapon after a girl is as grotesque as giving the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima the code name ‘Little Boy’.” It’s obvious that Sodom 2013 haven’t changed their scornful view of the world, presenting an album in Epitome Of Torture that is as uncompromising as ever in musical as well as lyrical terms. “Unfortunately there’s still plenty of inspiration for angry lyrics around,” says Angelripper.

The bitter thrash metal attack ‘Waterboarding’, which deals with torture methods, fits perfectly into this context. “It always surprises me how inventive – in the most negative sense of the word – people can be when it comes to torturing others,” states the vocalist, who recorded Epitome Of Torture together with guitarist Bernemann and new drummer Markus “Makka” Freiwald. “At the same time, Epitome Of Torture features not only typical Sodom numbers, like the title track, our new hit ‘S.O.D.O.M.’ and ‘Stigmatized’, the toughest Sodom number in ages, but also two or three recordings which are slightly more moderate and melodic than what people have come to expect from us,” Tom Angelripper points out. He is referring to songs such as ‘Cannibal’ and ‘Tracing The Victim’, which allow guitarist Bernemann to present his impressive musical skills, as well as ‘Into The Skies Of War’, on which Angelripper allowed himself to be inspired by icons such as Motörhead and Tank: “Luckily, it’s impossible to hide my influences.”

Epitome Of Torture was produced by Waldemar Sorychta, whose expertise as a sound engineer and audio magician thoroughly benefitted Sodom’s 2010 release In War And Pieces. Tom Angelripper: “Waldemar is an exceptional producer, who always succeeds in evening out an artistŽs weak spot and promoting his strengths. He doesn’t let you get away with anything, he knows all our weak spots. Which occasionally makes working at the studio a little demanding, but at the end of the day it’s all worthwhile, as the result shows.” The Sodom frontman describes the sound on Epitome Of Torture as “hard-as-nails and contemporary, without ignoring our tried-and-tested old-school attitude.”

The new album will be available worldwide through SPV/Steamhammer in four different formats: as a limited-edition DigiPak including two bonus tracks and a poster, in a regular jewel case, as a double gatefold colored vinyl with three bonus tracks and for download. The cover artwork featuring Sodom‘s popular “Knarrenheinz”logo was developed by graphic designer Meran Karanitant, who has caused a stir with his work for Six Feet Under, Hatebreed and Dimmu Borgir, among others.

Personally I do buy albums that I like. If I find an album that I really enjoy on Spotify, for example, I'd buy it in physical format. Why? Because I can touch it, according to me, everything that is digital is easily forgotten. 

Also, when I get really old and hopefully are a grandpa. I'm gonna teach them kids what real music is all about.

How about you?"
"/r/thrashmetal Do you buy the albums you like?","I still buy physical copies.  I can burn from the physical copy to digital and then I still have a real copy if DRM changes, etc.
Also there is still something cool about opening one up, looking at the lyrics, liner notes..."
"/r/thrashmetal Do you buy the albums you like?","Of course I do.  And not just the albums.  I've got a collection of live dvd/blu rays I'll put up against anyone's - I'll often buy the live dvd to check  out a band before I buy any of their albums.  And don't get me started on my metal shirt collection."
"/r/thrashmetal Do you buy the albums you like?","I steal it first and if I like it, I buy the album.  By album I mean LP/12""/Vinyl.  I can burn CDs and have most of my CDs are in storage.  If a band doesn't press a record they don't need my money."
"/r/thrashmetal Do you buy the albums you like?","I've gotten into a bad habit of stealing albums I like.  Even the ones I really enjoy.  I always tell myself ""I'll buy it later when I have the money"" but I never come through.."
"/r/thrashmetal Do you buy the albums you like?","You should make a monthly cd budget and stick to it.
Even if you only buy one cd a month, you're already contributing."
"/r/thrashmetal Do you buy the albums you like?","My monthly cd budget turned into my monthly spotify subscription. "
"/r/thrashmetal Do you buy the albums you like?","Unfortunately space is a problem for me so I have to settle for buying digital albums for the time being. Like you I do like CDs and vinyl, its something you can physically say its yours. Sucks not having the space for it but I'll settle for digital over nothing!"
"/r/thrashmetal Do you buy the albums you like?","Absolutely. Anybody who wouldn't is a dick. "
"/r/thrashmetal Do you buy the albums you like?","I still buy cds. I have about 300"
"/r/thrashmetal Do you buy the albums you like?","I subscribe to Spotify, and if there's an album I really like I'll buy a physical copy too."
"/r/thrashmetal Do you buy the albums you like?","I buy albums all the time, be it on CD, Vinyl, or even cassette if I'm desperate. I have as long as I have been listening to music. "
"/r/thrashmetal Do you buy the albums you like?","Yes, yes, a million times yes.

Even if it takes me a couple of years to actually have the spare cash (I'm poor. lol), I'm going to buy any album I like, and support the bands.

And that's in addition to being subscribed to spotify... which the bands get paid for as well."

I'm thinking Testament, Exodus, Overkill, Sepultura, Sodom, Kreator, Destruction Coroner, Sabbat, Dark Angel, Morbid Saint, Artillery, Vektor, and Demolition Hammer (sorry looong list)."

&gt;""I was listening to those songs and thinking they’re just as relevant today. Take 'Psychotron,' and think about all the stuff that’s going on now with drones [unmanned combat vehicles]. So I don’t feel that there’s such a big stretch between then and now with this band.""

"(December) Best metal concert you've attended or seen?","The best thrash metal concert I attended was the 2011 Big Four concert in Yankee Stadium.

http://cf.badassdigest.com/_uploads/images/15975/big_four__span.jpg

Though I must say, the best metal concerts I see on youtube have to be [Rammstein [NSFW]](http://www.mysweetshadow.co.uk/images/gigs/rammstein-nottingham-2012/rammstein-nottingham-cock-cannon.png)"
"(December) Best metal concert you've attended or seen?","I would say best thrash metal shows i have seen are always going to be at smaller venues that fill up.  This year i was able to catch Havok in one show and Toxic Holocaust in another, both in Brooklyn, NY and had an amazing time.  Was able to meet the band as well.  I have seen bigger acts like Megadeth and Anthrax and had a good time, but the smaller shows are where its at for me.  


Edit - Also, as an Ecuadorian...i approve of that fan up front for the big four holding an Ecuadorian Flag that says metallica.  Pretty awesome.  "
"(December) Best metal concert you've attended or seen?","I agree about the smaller shows being better. Skeletonwitch is playing here this month at a little hole in the wall and it's going to be awesome."
"(December) Best metal concert you've attended or seen?","jealous!  they are playing in NYC next month but in a larger venue for 41 bucks."
"(December) Best metal concert you've attended or seen?","Holy crap! 41 bucks?"
"(December) Best metal concert you've attended or seen?","I think I'd have to say Megadeth December 22, 1990 on the Rust in Peace tour. I had just turned 15 and it was first real metal show I had been to. It was a place called The Morocco Shrine Auditorium in Jax, FL. It was basically a bingo hall. I still have the ticket stub. http://i.imgur.com/XyVTAdS.jpg

A close second would probably be Danzig in 1993 on the Danzig 4 tour. I remember Korn opening up for them and no one knew who they were. Marilyn Manson played second, and the drummer passed out in the middle of the show. This resulted in the crowd cheering so they just left the stage and the house played Seasons in the Abyss in it's entirety before Danzig's set. You can imagine how good Slayer sounded after Marilyn Manson. People were moshing and singing to it. At some point during the Danzig set, John Christ threw one of his guitar picks and it ended up on my friend's shoulder. We're not sure how long it was there, but I noticed it just sitting there during a song. It was a pretty cool night.

My third favorite show would be Metallica in 1991. My friend won snake pit passes so we got to do the meet and greet and everything. I would have preferred to see them on the Justice tour, but hey, you can imagine how awesome this was for a 15 year old metalhead to be able to go into the snake pit and then meet Metallica.

"(December) Best metal concert you've attended or seen?","Slayer last year in June. It was a small show, only 1300 people. No opening band, only Slayer. It was awesome. I was in the front row, and I even met Tom and Kerry before the show. They put Hanneman's guitar on stage, that was nice. They all played great. No one can replace Hanneman, but Holt was great, full of energy. After the show my friend got a crew member to give him Holt's half-full beer bottle. We also caught setlists.

It was the best metal concert I've ever been to. And then I saw Iron Maiden live.

"
"(December) Best metal concert you've attended or seen?","Tie between Biohazard and Fear Factory, both played in very small venues and kicked ass.

One thing I remember from the Biohazard show, there was this wasted couple in front of me being more than obnoxious. The dude then climbed a tall stack of speakers and wanted to dive into the crowd and surf. Nobody looked anxious to catch him though and Evan stopped in the middle of a song and told everyone they'd better catch him or they'd walk off the stage. Dude was caught and immediately set on the ground. Someone ended up throwing an elbow up into his eye and so off he stumbled to the exit with his hollering bitch of a gf. "

"Today is the 23rd of May. For some, a new Memorial Day. Dedicated to a Slayer slain, the Angel of Death, Jeff Hanneman. Here's to the bound and determined seasons in the abyss. May you forever reign in blood, and rest in peace.","DETAILS FOR JEFF HANNEMAN MEMORIAL CELEBRATION:

The Jeff Hanneman Memorial Celebration will take place on Thursday, May 23 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles from 3:30 – 7:30PM. Hanneman passed away on May 2 at the age of 49.

The Memorial Celebration will be free and open to the public on a first-come, first-in basis (subject to venue capacity). All ages are welcome, and paid parking will be available around the venue.

Jeff Hanneman helped shape Slayer’s uncompromising thrash-metal sound as well as an entire genre of music. His riffs of fury and punk-rock attitude were heard in the songs he wrote, including Slayer classics “Angel of Death,” “Raining Blood,” “South of Heaven” and “War Ensemble.” Hanneman co-founded Slayer with fellow-guitarist Kerry King, bassist Tom Araya and drummer Dave Lombardo in Huntington Park, CA in 1981. For more than 30 years, Hanneman was the band member who stayed out of the spotlight, rarely did interviews, amassed an impressive collection of World War II memorabilia, was with his wife Kathy for nearly three decades, shut off his phone and went incommunicado when he was home from tour, did not want to be on the road too late into any December as Christmas was his favorite holiday, and, from the time he was about 12 years old, woke up every, single day with one thing on his mind: playing the guitar.

It was once suggested to Slayer that if they would write “just one mainstream song that could get on the radio,” they would likely sell millions of records and change the commercial course of their career, similar to what had happened to Metallica with 1993′s “Enter Sandman.” Jeff was the first to draw a line of integrity in the sand, replying, “We’re going to make a Slayer record. If you can get it on the radio, fine, if not, then fuck it.”"

"In Tyrannos - Die Maske Fällt (Excellent German Band)","Translated Lyrics:

""Can we allow that tyranny triumphs over freedom?"" 

    Federal Reserve Bank, Dollar domination 
    A central bank system, which gathers infinitely 
    The total capital of the United States 
    In the hands of a few financial magnates 

    Government, Senate and U.S. Congress 
    Don't even control a single penny 
    Private bankers who run the cash flow 
    The biggest scam of all time 

chorus: 

    Money rules over America and America over the world 
    Banking alliances, money rules the world 
    But who rules the money? The mask falls ... it falls it falls ... 
    The mask falls 
 
    With a license to print money they can swallow all countries 
    They can squeeze States, they can eat up peoples 


Bridge: 

    Money their prayers 
    God and Prophet 
    speculation 
    Golden throne 

    Run and run the money printing machines 
    To freshly printed tickets to sell to the State 
    From plain paper are trillion dollar 
    A good deal for the World Bank-drones 

    Forever in debt, almost all nations 
    For interest and compound interest continues to indulge now 
    Share terror, stock usury according to plans 
    The world in the grip of financial hyenas 


chorus: 

    Money rules over America and America over the world 
    Banking alliances, money rules the world 
    But who rules the money? The mask falls ... it falls it falls ... 
    The mask falls 
 
    The whole world is on the knees 
    Before this whole clans and dynasties 
    Only one thing counts for the bandits 
    The highest possible returns 

    The New World Order 
    Loan capital - the world's fate, interest slavery - Never more free 
    You always finance all parties 
    Handles with weapons and war bonds 
    Death and destruction are their capital 
    Because the reconstruction they charge again 

    ""You are already choking freedom in its cradle""

Original Lyrics:

    ""Können wir zulassen, dass die Tyrannei über die Freiheit triumphiert?""

    Federal Reserve Bank, Dollarherrschaft
    Ein Zentralbanksystem, welches unendlich rafft
    Das Gesamtkapital der Vereinigten Staaten
    In Händen von ein paar Finanzmagnaten

    Regierung, Senat und US-Parlament
    kontrollieren nicht mal einen einzigen Cent
    Private Bankiers, die die Geldströme leiten
    Der größte Betrug aller Zeiten

Refrain:

    Geld herrscht über Amerika und Amerika über die Welt
    Banken-Allianzen, Geld regiert die Welt
    Doch wer regiert das Geld? Die Maske fällt ...sie fällt ...sie fällt
    Die Maske fällt

    Mit der Lizenz zum Geld drucken können sie alle Länder schlucken
    Können sie Staaten auspressen, Können sie Völker auffressen


Bridge:

    Geld ihr Gebet
    Gott und Prophet
    Spekulation
    Goldener Thron

    Die Gelddruckmaschinen laufen und laufen
    Um druckfrische Scheine dem Staat zu verkaufen
    Aus Blankopapier werden Dollar-Billionen
    Ein gutes Geschäft für die Weltbank-Drohnen

    Auf ewig verschuldet fast alle Nationen 
    Für Zins- und Zinseszins nun weiter zu fronen
    Aktienterror, Börsenwucher nach Plänen
    Die Welt im Griff der Finanzhyänen


Refrain:

    Geld herrscht über Amerika und Amerika über die Welt
    Banken-Allianzen, Geld regiert die Welt
    Doch wer regiert das Geld? Die Maske fällt ...sie fällt ...sie fällt
    Die Maske fällt
    
    Die ganze Welt liegt auf dem Knien
    Vor diesen ganzen Clans und Dynastien
    Nur eines zählt für die Banditen
    Höchstmögliche Renditen

    The New World Order 
    Leihkapital - Weltenschicksal, Zinssklaverei - Niemals mehr frei
    Sie finanzieren stets alle Parteien
    Handelm mit Waffen und Kriegsanleihen
    Tot und Zerstörung sind ihr Kapital
    Denn beim Wiederaufbau kassieren sie nochmal

    ""Ihr erdrosselt die Freiheit schon in ihrer Wiege"""

"''Modern'' sounding thrash metal?","I love tonnes of 80's/90's thrash metal but I'm sick of the sound being copied by revivalist bands. 

I absolutely love thrash bands that have chosen a more fresh and modern sound; especially those that make the most out of beefier production. Examples would include any 2000's material by Testament , Exodus, Revocation and so on.

Are there any similar-sounding thrash bands out there you can recommend? "

The solo in particular is perfect - shows excellent musicianship without being too far over the top (and so many solos with sweeping in them are over the top.) Almost every lead technique that metal guitarists have trouble with is executed perfectly with smooth transitioning between each.

[Lich King - Born of the Bomb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-PtbMI2chg) is a recent one that I love. I've never felt like Thrash worked with storytelling as well as other genres (such as power metal) but the song writing here couldn't be better and the two bands work together perfectly."

"A Thrash Re-Exploration","Ok, while I've said I like thrash for a good decade, I realized recently that I don't really listen to thrash. To remedy this I've begun a band-by-band listening experience. Today I listened to the first four albums by Testament (even though I've listened to most of these before).
Gotta say the singer sounds a lot liek Metallica (as that is what I'm more used to), but without the frantic sound that their (Metallica) albums had. It's much more cohesive and technical then most thrash of the 80's. 
Thoughts?

More updates as I go through my collection (almost a hundred artists within)."
"A Thrash Re-Exploration","Testament has always been one of my favorites. I think they put the right riffs with decent song writings, on top of excellent solo work by Skolnick. The first four albums may have a decent amount of filler, but they aren't BAD songs. On top of the usual greats (Over the Wall, Into the Pit, Souls of Black) they sometimes throw a curve ball and give something really different but just as kickass, like Musical Death(A Dirge) 

I also saw them last week on the Dark Roots of Thrash tour, if you have the chance you should check them out. It was really a great show and flawlessly executed by all the guys, and who doesn't love Gene Hoglan. "

So many metal bands redo old stuff and I can't think of a single time I have preferred the new version. I bought this album and played it once and it has collected dust since. It's interesting for sure, but not a touch on the energy of the original. They had played it far too much by that point to MEAN it. Again no offence if you like it, I just think bands shouldn't do this.
It's the same with the new Exodus - Bonded by blood. Why would I ever put that on when I have the original? Manowar released Battle Hymns again and it was the same story. If I wanted to hear a new version I would see them live...  "

"Spotify thrash metal lovers!","Hey everybody! I know a lot of users here are Spotify users as well as fans of numerous types of music as well as metal. I used to run a website called Metal Delirium that really helped me achieve a lot of goals and success in the music industry but do to other jobs and financial priorities....you know what you guys don't care about that.

We have started a new program on Spotify taking advantage of their playlist capabilities as well as apps.

Currently we have a few different people that are going to be making playlists for us to share. You see, we always see Metal Playlists on the 'Discover' tab but it's always the same old shit, we want to be different. We always prided ourselves in new music, undiscovered music, and off the wall shit you might not have been comfortable with.

We are currently on Soundrop streaming our 'Metal Delirium Radio 9/11"" playlist, which is our 'new music one.'

http://open.soundrop.fm/s/Xq6c1hVrZMrK1sK4


https://play.spotify.com/user/metaldelirium



In the future we want to have genre specific, fantasy set lists, lesser known songs, and other cool stuff other apps and websites aren't doing.

We don't want money, we don't want to advertise, we just want you to give us a chance, share our love of metal, and share in our love of music."

"Do not downvote songs that sound thrash but are not made by a thrash-metal band.","I keep having genre-nazis argue with me about this all over the metal subreddits.

Just because a band primarily does X genre music, does not mean it cannot make Y genre songs too.

Only upvote/downvote based on how you love/hate the song and whether the SONG's genre matches the subreddit (not the BAND's genre).

When you downvote it, be brutally honest, say ""I don't like this song."" or ""I don't think this song sounds thrash."" However...

**TL;DR: don't give me reasons like ""X band isn't a thrash metal band."" (no shit)**

This is a rule now, read the sidebar. You don't downvote things because a band primarily does some other genre (just as you wouldn't downvote metallica just because they 'sold out' and made rock songs; you judge each song individually).

Thank you for your time. Comments appreciated. Metal can only evolve if we don't constantly argue about genres."

This subreddit is filtered away from songs that sound death-metal, black-metal, metal-core, nu-metal etc.

&gt;Only upvote/downvote based on how you love/hate the song and whether the SONG's genre matches the subreddit (not the BAND's genre).

While this, means that you shouldn't downvote a band, say even a death-metal band, that isn't consistently screaming/growling and has made a great thrash metal song.

I agree the wording is off, I'll correct it.

**edit:** fixed, changed ""bands"" to ""songs"", for clarification (just because a band has screaming songs doesn't mean they can't have a non-screaming thrash metal song too)."
"Do not downvote songs that sound thrash but are not made by a thrash-metal band.","Yeah that's what I was referring to in my first post, sorry if I was unclear.

I still think the screaming thing is an issue, since lots of ""thrash metal"" bands use it in a lot of their songs. I know you define thrash differently than I do, but I think if you look at what the community puts on the front page (which I'm sure you do) I think you'll get a good idea of what the majority definition of thrash is, and if people follow this rule, I think it's gonna reallllly cut down the submission rate."
"Do not downvote songs that sound thrash but are not made by a thrash-metal band.","That is why the keyword ""consistent"" is there. There are plenty of occasional screaming, yelling, shouting, in metal songs. 

But usually you won't find a thrash metal song that is filled consistently with screaming/growling. It even makes it difficult to hear the music.

If I look on the front page on this community, I don't see anyone violating the rules I put on the sidebar. I haven't moderated/deleted/removed a submission in a long long time.

I'm more concerned about the fact that the community is much more vicious in downvoting (that is affecting our submission-rate), rather than me or moderators moderating too much."

"Local thrash band called Killing Session out of Cincinnati. Check these guys out.","please tell these guys to use just one main vocals instead of trying to do the dual shit. It's not working out. Otherwise, sounds ok. Drum production sounds bad though honestly. Riffs are weird, but have some potential. 5/10"

"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Can someone share some thrash metal bands with guttural vocals? Something like Pantera, if you got more than one, great."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Sodom"
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Indeed, first band that sprung to mind."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Kreator as well.  Endless Pain was quite possibly the very first thrash album with guttural vocals."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Yeah man, Pleasure to Kill comes to mind, too. Any Kreator where Ventor (drummer) sings is also extra gruff."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Yeah, they did have a ""death metal"" influence phase. As did Testament, come to think of it."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Demolition Hammer. Epidemic of Violence and Tortured Existence are unreal. "
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","The first Cannibal Corpse album, ""Eaten Back to Life"" is pretty thrashy, plus has guttural vocals. Not as death metal as Butchered at Birth and beyond."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","I don't hear that.  Can you post an example of a song from that album that is ""pretty thrashy""?"
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Not straight thrash by any means, but the track Mangled, specifically. It has more of a thrash/hardcore punk drum style, and thrash-styled guitar. It sounds that way to me, anyhow. "
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","I see what you mean.  Definitely a hardcore sort of influence there."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","The track, ""Put Them to Death"" also has some thrashy parts to it. Specifically the second half of the song. "
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Skeletonwitch is considered blackened thrash, and you may want to check out some later Testament. Try ""Demonic"" if you want a death-y style sound. 

Pantera, though, isn't thrash, and if you want ""gutteral"" like him, then you won't have to look too hard. They're groove metal. "
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Well, following wikipedia and some ""best thrash metal bands/songs"" lists, they're thrash. Anyway, thanks I will try those."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","It says that about Pantera? That's cute.

FIRST FOUR ALBUMS ONLY /teasing hardcore fans

Edit: Also, damn, wow, that Wikipedia page is pitifully badly organized. ""Hey, this band has some vaguely thrashy elements ... uh ... chuck them in there"". Damn community editing doesn't always work, I suppose."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Only when you have self-professed metalheads whose extent of the genre is focused almost entirely on mainstream metal bands like Pantera.  I don't ever depend on Wikipedia for genres anyway.  The standard there is if someone in a newspaper, magazine, etc. refers to a band as being part of a particular genre, they can be written as such on their page.

Go to Metal Archives for accurate genre listings."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","True that. I've known about that site and increasingly had to use it here and there over the years, no clue why it's still not a first go-to for my brain most of the time."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","God, it's awfully nitpicky to make an entire separate genre classification that basically amounts to ""thrashy but slower.""  Then again, what's more metal than needless technicality?

"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Nunslaughter and Witchery are some of my favorites."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Try toxic holocaust.
They're a mix with thrash, punk and black metal lirycs."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Try Infernäl Mäjesty. Also Num Skull and Dragon (Pol).

Edit: Oh wait, you said Pantera-Like. Never mind, then. Exhorder it is."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Phil Anselmo is not thrash, pretty sure when Pantera was thrash he wasn't very guttural. What do you mean? Once you start singing like Phil Anselmo it stops being thrash.

EDIT: I'm drunk, so this may be more inflammatory than intended.

EDIT 2: When Phil Anselmo speaks he sounds EXACTLY like that cockroach dude in human disguise from men in black.

EDIT 3: Try 'SODOM' they are thrash and pretty guttural. Maybe Sepultura - Beneath The Remains"
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","[deleted]"
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Has nobody mentioned GWAR? They're not the guttural-est but neither is Pantera. They definitely have a roughness and intensity that I think you'll find interesting. Also totally seconding Sodom, good stuff.

By subgenre definition, thrash music typically (though of course not always) uses a thrash-style harsh vocal, which is often not the same as ""growls"", depending on the definitions of harsh vocals you use. You'll find some examples that cross over, though. "
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","GWAR isn't fast enough to be thrash but neither is Pantera.  Think Exodus, Overkill, DRI, Anthrax, Testament, Megadeth, Metallica, Exhorder, etc."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Pantera most certainly isn't thrash, but I disagree with you about GWAR and I disagree that speed is the defining characteristic to consider. Overall speed is a factor, but bands like Megadeth prove that thrashy elements aren't always in the kickin' backbeats and high tempos ... just *mostly*. Edit: I mean, half of my favorite Overkill songs are factually slower than some of my favorite GWAR songs. It just doesn't stand as a criteria ^^I ^^should ^^have ^^said ^^""a ^^sole ^^criterion"" ^^here ^^... . Edit edit: I should note that my exposure to GWAR is somewhat cursory so maybe some of their material varies more widely than I'm aware."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Well I mean thrash metal got its name from being an offshoot of speed metal.  Speed is absolutely one of the main defining characteristics of thrash metal.  In GWAR's case, most of their music is in the classic metal vein but they are definitely full of thrash elements. Anyway, we're nitpicking here.  I've been banging my head to metal since the 80's and ain't about to stop.  :)"
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","*One of* the main defining characteristics, I agree -- it just seemed to me like you were saying it was an essential ""yes/no"" indicator, know what I mean? But I can tell from your reply here that I read into your comment before a bit too much, and we both agree that it's nitpicky after a point, ha! And well, shit, if there's more traditional heavy in GWAR than I realized, that's just a good reason to go listen to more of it! Thanks for the memo. ;)"
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","The funny thing is that even though I've seen GWAR in concert and thought I knew what I was talking about, after reading your post and went to Youtube and damn if every GWAR tune I randomly picked wasn't fairly straight up thrash LOL"

"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?","Deathchain (first two albums), Oppressive (my friends band https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vBNqlF7Mo), Possessed."
"Thrash bands with guttural vocals?"," Generally, keep in mind that German Thrash is heavier, with harsher vocals. So you've got your classics, like Sodom, Kreator, Destruction, Exumer, Tormentor, Protector, Poison... German Thrash, one of the best style of music ever, look it up.  Then, if you want guttural vocals, you might want to try death/thrash; bands like Merciless, Massacra, Mortal Sin, Morbid Saint, Rigor Mortis, Possessed... And for bands like Pantera, you're looking for groove metal, so try listening to Exhorder, Lamb of God and Warbeast."

"Can you think of any good Thrash power trios?","Municipal Waste is all one guitar, Overkill used to be all one guitar for their first four albums or so, Sodom is a power trio to this day, as is S.O.D., D.R.I., and a lot of others."

"Can you think of any good Thrash power trios?","Destruction is the shit."
"Can you think of any good Thrash power trios?","They may not be pure thrash, but they're *thrashy*, but Pantera did alright for themselves with one guitarist.

Prong was thrash for awhile as a 3 piece and they were damn good.  They changed sounds here and there and occasionally added a second guitar live but for the most part were/are 3 piece.  

Propain is often a 3 piece, but sometimes they add a rythym guitarist.  Again not really *thrash* but similar enough to demonstrate a trio can pull it off.

Also Voivod did a stint in the 90s as a trio."
"Can you think of any good Thrash power trios?","Yeah I guess Pantera did okay for themselves.. ha.  I'd forgotten about Prong, I guess because I think of them as more part of that whole 90's Brooklyn thing.

I believe Annihilator only had one guitar for awhile, and Razor only had one for most their career, Tankard hasn't had two for awhile.  Destruction comes to mind as well as Exciter if you count them as thrash.  There is also S.O.D., Whiplash, Sodom, Sadus, Realm, Exumer.  Quite a few if you look into it.  "

[A Light Will Shine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGY1bUEW1mc)

[Evolve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XetrdAdOM)

They have some sick riffs that reminds you of that perfect 80s-90s thrash like the big four. Their vocalist sings really well and actually puts work into song structure unlike most metal bands.

The guitarist is incredibly talented and even has videos of basically simulating the style of many famous guitarists.

If you're looking for more stuff that has that aggression, high-tempo, but melodic kind of metal (though albeit may not be as heavy), I introduce a lot of good new bands and old classics in /r/catchymelodicmetal as well. But only if you want to expand a bit more than just thrash metal."

"POLTERGEIST planning on writing a new album next year",""" Poltergeist IS BACK "" . Thrasher 's origins back to swiss metal scene since the last album released in 1993. The personnel like ' VO Pulver ( guitar ) ' , ' Andre Grieder ( Vocal ) ' , ' Marek Felis ( Bass ) ' re- gathered to discuss plans to write material for a new album next year . ' Poltergeist ' interesting drummer ' Sven Vormann ' former drummer ' Destruction' 1999-2001 .

' Poltergeist ' was formed in 1985 in Basel - Switzerland , and has 3 new studio album . Substitution is often experienced by the band's drummer , they had to replace 4 drummer for the band career . Their last album release in 1993, ' Nothing Last Forever ' very well received , especially when released Thrash scene is experiencing a decline in that time .

Character offered thrash music ' Poltergeist ' has a complex element in terms of musical structure , in addition to getting thrasy dominant riff , in their music we also get some parts bleak and black shades . Although the music of the groove a little monotonous if we repeatedly heard their music , but there's nothing worse than a collectivity their music , the music sounded neat and elegant .

"Modern Big 4?","In your opinion, who do you think would be 'the big 4' of today's thrash?
And who would you rather it be?

I'd say Evile (even though I don't care for them), Havok, Municipal Waste, and maybe Skeletonwitch (despite not really being pure thrash).

They seem to have the highest sales of all the newer thrash bands, and that's how the original Big 4 were decided... album sales. 

And let's just say who more than likely IS the new big 4, and who I'd PREFER are really different.

I'd PREFER it to be Havok, Savage Messiah, HeXeN, and Lost Society."
"Modern Big 4?","I don't know how high their album sales are, but Fueled by Fire's last 2 albums definitely got them a spot on my big 4. "
"Modern Big 4?","Anyone with a song called ""Ernest Goes to Hell"" deserves a spot."
"Modern Big 4?","I think that's probably the biggest four... even though I don't like Evile nor Skeletonwitch. 

My PREFERRED four? Gama Bomb, Municipal Waste, Lich King, and (as of late) Condition Critical."
"Modern Big 4?","I'm almost certain it's Municipal Waste, Warbringer, Evile, and Havok."
"Modern Big 4?","[deleted]"
"Modern Big 4?","My personal top 4 of modern thrash metal bands would probably be lich king, municipal waste, gama bomb and lost society. "
"Modern Big 4?","I'd say Warbringer, Suicidal Angels, Havok and Municipal Waste"
"Modern Big 4?","The fact that this sub *has* the traditional Big 4 --whose new releases mostly suck--in the sidebar, and not as a blacklist like /r/BlackMetal does with prominent artists in that genre is a good reason for me to prefer /r/truethrash."
"Modern Big 4?","In terms of just pure thrash. I would go with Havok, Warbringer, Gama Bomb, and Lich King. I just think they do it the best. (Honorable mentions: Skeletonwitch, Toxic Holocaust, Municipal Waste and Bonded By Blood)"

"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","I prefer Lightning. What do yall think?"
"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","Lightning.  Master is more produced.  Lightning still has the young band feel about the production.
"
"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","Not possible. They're both in their own unique league of awesomeness."
"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","Puppets. Better songs, better production. Hetfields voice is mint on this one.  "
"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","Lighting for sure"
"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","http://imgur.com/JjXPu7a"
"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","Ride The Lightning, again and again.
An overall more intense record that flows more cohesively, in my opinion."
"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","Hmm.. tough call. While the highs of Ride the Lightning (For Whom the Bell Tolls &amp; Fade to Black) are greater than Master of Puppets for me, I've never seen a song so out of place like Escape was on that album.  For musical content, it's dead even for me. 

So I'd say Ride the Lightning based upon the production. I like a bit more of a raw production on thrash albums, it's part of the allure of thrash for me. "
"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","Escape... yeah that's a good point.  It's easy to forget sometimes that Lightning has a throw away song, whereas Puppets is solid all the way through."
"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","I've always been a bit more partial to Ride the lightning, to me it always sounded a bit more raw."

"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","Lightning hands down. Its the only album i can listen to straight through with out skipping any songs. "
"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","I say skip both and find a bootleg of no life til leather. "
"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","I'm gonna go with Lightning, much better overall album songs wise. Master is more recognized, but Ride the Lightning is much faster and better in my mind.
"
"Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?","Ride the MOTHERFUCKEN LIGHTNING! Not a single bad song on that one. Also a much rawer sound imho."

"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","I am so disappointed that Anthrax is so unliked. I love Anthrax and Megadeth the most"
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","A few years ago, when I was a freshmen in high school, I'd easily vote for Metallica, but, idk I guess I burnt myself out with Metallica and they got kinda old to me. But ever since I got into Slayer, I can't stop listening, they don't get old (especially Reign In Blood)."
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","First place for Slayer, second for old Metallica and then Megadeth. Never really understood why Anthrax is on the big four, (even tho i like the band very much) but there are easily better ones out there. Like example Annihilator or Testament."
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","People are not aware of the depth, intricacy, and masterpieces made by Anthrax. They just don't have as much clout and albums as the other 3 bands. They also have very strange music sometimes that makes you not want to listen to others. 

i.e., it's hard to get into, but Anthrax is definitely deserving of Big Four and if you don't agree I suggest you listen to more than the first-page-of-""anthrax""-youtube."
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","Megadeth and Metallica"
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","I know it's trendy to hate on Metallica and stuff but I have to say them, best metal band ever. I love the other 3 bands too."
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","I love all 4 of those bands, and have since the late 80s, but come on, put on a playlist of Master of Puppets, Orion, One, Creeping Death, and Call of Ktulu, and the other 3 bands combined can't compete with it."
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","IMO
1. Metallica
2.Megadeth
3/4. Tie Anthrax and Slayer"
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","Honestly it is hard to choose as they are all such incredible bands.

Even thrash metal fans, those who think one of the bands is not ""good enough"" should go back and listen to all the albums because I assure you: you are wrong. They are all good and the term ""big four"" didn't come out of nowhere."
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","I really think that Metallica/Slayer should take the #1 spot in a tie, but the other 2 listed on there should be replaced with Exodus (especially Megadeth) as Exodus really represents to me what thrash metal should be about.

"
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","You must not have listened to much Megadeth or Anthrax. Try listening to it again you'll change your mind."
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","I've listened to plenty of Megadeth, and the more I listen, the more I can't stand em, and I couldn't get into anthrax, they just don't seem to embody the vision of what thrash metal music should be. If you listen to Exodus-Another lesson in violence, that's what thrash metal should be. "
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","I mean if you hate melody with good metal pausing and aggressive speed changes which is exactly what Megadeth and Anthrax are known for; then yes you won't like Megadeth or Anthrax.

Some don't like the vocals so I can understand that."
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","[deleted]"
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","1. Megadeth 2. Metallica 3. Slayer. I dont listen to Anthrax."
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","Had to go with Megadeth. I kind of would have liked the ""Other Big Four"" (Testament, Exodus, Overkill and Kreator) to have been included, or have a separate poll all together."
"The Big Four of Thrash Metal: Who’s really on top? (Poll)","Metallica easily. Not only are they te most successful, but they were the first breakout band in the sub-genre. 

After them, I'd probably list SLAYER followed by Anthrax then Megadeth (last two are more so my opinion)"

Perhaps it's the demographic or whatever but it's funny, I really would expect there to be a higher amount of contribution. I find myself 'holding back' suggestions to give other people a chance to peddle their wares.
It's just a rant, really, that this /thrashmetal thing just seems to be so... quiet. Where is all the input? It's a shame. 
It's almost as if outside the bands that everyone likes there are a few sub-types of this genre or something of the sort that stops all us lazy bastards (and I am not exempt) from even clicking on peoples links. I would love it to be more vibrant - surely more people like this stuff?

Historically, Megadeth is my favorite band, which is probably why I find this album so appalling.  The irony is that as the bands ""mature"" and ""progress"" their music becomes more and more cookie cutter and it is embarrassing.  I don't even want to see them on tour this time because I can't sit there and listen to him sing this garbage."
"New Megadeth album sampling available on Amazon. What does everyone here think of the new album?","I highly doubt they will get on radio so I don't think that's the issue here.

"New Megadeth album sampling available on Amazon. What does everyone here think of the new album?","I actually like it a lot, I'm not surprised the thrash community hasn't taken a liking to it, but thrash fans in general just don't like it when artists try to branch out. I think the title track is really well-done, and there are a bunch of other standouts on the album like Dance In The Rain and Forget To Remember.

I think it's refreshing when a band like Megadeth tries to get out of a rut by trying something new, rather than making the same album over and over again."

In my opinion (which will get ""downvoted into oblivion"" and my personal opinion) it goes like this: Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer and Metallica.

"What new bands from other genres have you discovered that remind you of 80s/90s thrash metal [Monthly sticky]","I discovered Machinae Supremacy some time ago, they make a lot of ""video game""/""sid-chip"" metal, but they also have a lot of energetic riffs, melodic solos that remind you of Marty Friedman (their guitarist also uses the same guitar so it cannot be a coincidence)--and while it's not really heavy they do have some heavy and aggressive songs that remind you of thrash metal.

Some of them I posted to: /r/catchymelodicmetal"

"Megadeth's new single - Kingmaker","Decent tune. Much better than the awful title track. I have a feeling this album will be another Thirteen, a couple of good tunes surrounded by mediocrity. "

"Megadeth's new single - Kingmaker","Risk exists remember."
"Megadeth's new single - Kingmaker","Definitely better than the previous single I heard from this album.  I wish Dave had stuck with what he was doing on Endgame though, for latter-day Megadeth that's about as good as it's gonna get.  What little I've heard of this one suggests he's going back to a poppier, less thrashy songwriting style."
"Megadeth's new single - Kingmaker","Still a good song though. He doesn't have the energy or creativity left to do pure complicated thrash like in his youth, the guy is 55. I'd cut him a break.  We probably won't ever get another RIP or SFSGSW, KIMB, or PS, or even CTE, or even Youthanasia. It just won't ever happen. These were timeless legendary masterpieces made in the pinnacle of this guy's career.

But at least he's trying. And it's just disrespectful to have a new megadeth song that can't even get 1 upvote. 

I can see that happening with supercollider, but this is not that bad."
"Megadeth's new single - Kingmaker","It's may be receiving downvotes because even though Megadeth were once a great thrash act, you can't really consider this a thrash song."

"Recommendations?","I Just started getting into thrash metal (coming straight out of a hardcore punk phase). The cro-mags turned me on to thrash. So far I've listened to Kill em All and Show No Mercy. I listened to Megadeath a little too, but don't really love Mustaine's voice. Can I get some recommendations of where to go next?"
"Recommendations?","I couldn't recommend better start. Those are the first two albums that got me into thrash. From there maybe D.R.I., Vio-Lence, Overkill and most definitely, Exodus ""Bonded by Blood""!!! "
"Recommendations?","I really liked Bounded by Blood, thanks for the suggestions. Been listening to a little bit of Municipal Waste too, glad to see this genre is still alive and kickin. "
"Recommendations?","lich king, toxic holocaust, skeletonwitch, warbringer."
"Recommendations?","Lazarus A.D. , Havok, skeletonwitch, lich king, lost society, nervosa, also check out revocation and sylosis which are like a mix of death/thrash"
"Recommendations?","honestly death metal is still a little far out for me. I think I've been liking the earlier sounding thrash so much because its like the next logical step after hardcore punk and crossover thrash."
"Recommendations?","I only mentioned death due to the vocals, aside from that they are pretty thrashy.  Check out the song after lifeless years by sylosis.  It's what hooked me on them in the first place"
"Recommendations?","[Game Over is unbeatable and they have a new album out very soon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BFFElAM6Hs)"
"Recommendations?","Sodom, Tankard, Exumer, Exhorder, D.R.I., S.O.D.,M.O.D."
"Recommendations?","Take the Big 4 and listen to their ""biggest"" albums. Reign in Blood by Slayer, Master of Puppets by Metallica, Among the Living by Anthrax, and Peace Sells/Rust in Peace by Megadeth. Slayer is the fastest and most aggressive, Anthrax the most ""Hardcore"" like, Megadeth is the most technical, and Metallica has a bit of everything. From there, you can see what you like because those 4 bands cover most kinds of thrash."

First thing I hear is far to much drum and not enough guitar/bass. 
Second thing I hear is this inhale type of screaming which lets be frank here is going to cut your career short. Do yourself a favor and get the fuck away from screaming shit. 


My suggestions to you guys is to find another guitarist to round out your sound. Give a listen to bands like Exodus, Hexen, Saxxon, and Machine Head. Try some Sepultura. I guarantee you you have nothing to lose by trying things out with two guitarists instead of three."

"So what did you guys think of Havok's new album Unnatural Selection?","I thought it was pretty good."
"So what did you guys think of Havok's new album Unnatural Selection?","I really dig ""Give Me Liberty..."" I'm getting the album tonight. "
"So what did you guys think of Havok's new album Unnatural Selection?","It's a big change from Time is UP. It's also a slightly different line up (new bassist) though. I enjoyed ""I am the State"", ""Give Me Liberty"", and ""Unnatural Selection"", but the other tracks were confusing, seeing as how their first two albums rip your brains apart. I noticed on their facebook they seem to refer to themselves as heavy metal now, so maybe they're making a genre hop. Either way I'll still rock their first two releases, plus Point of No Return, and always support their thrashy stuff."
"So what did you guys think of Havok's new album Unnatural Selection?","So, I shouldn't buy the album, then? I like thrash PERIOD. If it's not thrash, I'm gonna be real bummed."
"So what did you guys think of Havok's new album Unnatural Selection?","Straight up, I was disappointed when I listened to the album. It's not that the songs are terrible, most just seem to fall short of me wanting to listen to them again. The album itself lacks that in your face screaming adrenaline thrash usually has. The songs I mentioned before are the ones I will be adding to my ""thrash"" playlist. The album is $8 on itunes if you want go give it a try. I pre-ordered the album, but if I hadn't I would only purchase those three songs. "

I've always been a fan of popular trash (Big 4, Exodus, Testament, Overkill, other stuff), but recently I checked out Kreator for the first time after constantly hearing about them. I checked out sample songs from their early days, the early 90's era and Phantom Anti-Christ. These guys BLEW ME AWAY. I'm in a country with slow-ass wifi, but I want to hear what you guys think are their best songs/albums, so that when I get home to Canada, I can buy them. Sorry for the wall of text, but I would really appreciate it if you could contribute. Please, thank you, and keep moshing."
"Question:Best songs/albums by Kreator?","It's all about personal preference brother, whatever rocks your matt black boat is what matters most. My favorite albums are Extreme Aggression and Pleasure to Kill, and yeah Phantom Anti-Christ is actually not too bad.
Check out Sodom dude - Agent Orange and M16 are worth a listen. Peace!"
"Question:Best songs/albums by Kreator?","If you're a fan of early Destruction, Sodom etc., you know, beastial black metal/blackened thrash metal, Endless Pain is pretty good. The best track off of it in my opinion is Flag Of Hate. They play it live pretty often even now.

Pleasure To Kill is a classic and considered to be one of their best/the best album, the whole album is pretty sick, but my favorites are Pleasure To Kill, The Pestilence, Command Of The Blade and Under The Guillotine.

Terrible Certainty is a bit better controlled than the previous albums, it has better sound quality, production and so on. It's not just brutality and speed here anymore like in Pleasure To Kill. My favs here are Blind Faith and Storming With Menace.

Extreme Aggression is where the things get awesome. I think this is their best album, the riffs here are really memorable and nice, the songwriting is good. I can't even select the best tracks off of this album, I like them all.

Coma Of Souls has some really good songs in terms of lyrics (When The Sun Burns Red, 
People Of The Lie), the instrumentals are okay. 

I'm not a fan of the newer albums except Violent Revolution and Phantom Antichrist."
"Question:Best songs/albums by Kreator?","[deleted]"
"Question:Best songs/albums by Kreator?","Although I'm not a huge fan of the entire album, Riot of Violence is a great song off of Pleasure to Kill. Endless Pain is also a pretty good album.

"Any recommendations?","Born of the Bomb by Lich King is a great album I just picked up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq5z2wKoK4Y  Check out Slave to the Sword by Exmortus it's fantastic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEW8kbfE_NY In Hatred's Flame, their first album is more death metal than thrash but their second album Beyond the Fall of Time has some damn good tunes on it.

"(J+F) Most skilled lead guitarist you've found over the years","Sometimes I discover lead guitarists who are not even strictly in thrash metal but they have such skill that I expect they could perform flawlessly to compose and write powerful solos. They have the skill and intense dedication to their work and they don't miss notes even live. 

Since you're all used to listening to so much metal, I'd suspect you guys notice such good guitarists more often than not.

Tell us about such guitarists you've found / met / seen-play."
"(J+F) Most skilled lead guitarist you've found over the years","Conan from Exmortus. Erik from Vektor is also killer. Conan though, that guy fucking blazes. Josh Christian from Toxik is also an amazing player. Non-metal but mind blowing is Guthrie Govan haha. But overall, I'm pretty sure than Conan can fucking play ANYTHING haha. "
"(J+F) Most skilled lead guitarist you've found over the years","The most skilled lead guitarist I found is Andy James

He was lead guitarist of the band ""Sacred Mother Tongue"" which does a lot of heavy/thrash metal stuff lately.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XetrdAdOM&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=133

Their guitarist Andy James has youtube video series where he plays in the EXACT style of many of the most famous metal guitarists in the world. It's crazy how much talent he has.

Just unfortunate that the band broke up because they couldn't break through to any commercial success.

His stuff kinda reminds me of marty friedman, I can guess the notes before I hear them. Really creative stuff."
"(J+F) Most skilled lead guitarist you've found over the years","Vernon Reid has always blown my mind.  He was the one who made me pick up the guitar in the first place.  His album solos are literally amazing, but then I started seeing him live, and collecting their live albums.  What sets him apart more than anything, is that he improvises his solos live, at an absolutely incredible level.  It's one thing for a great guitarist to pull off a solo live when they've practiced it note-for-note for dozens of hours and played it the same way hundreds of times.  Vernon is playing mind-blowing solos, completely different every time.  I followed him(Living Colour) for 3 shows and each one was completely different, and at the absolute highest level of musicianship I've ever witnessed.  He's 55 now, and instead of slowing down, he's still getting better and better.

Got to sit 5 feet from him during a guitar clinic and he just melts faces. He's super energetic when he's playing and shreds at the speed of light. It kind of annoys me when a guy says ""I really pushed my limits when I wrote this one, so don't get super high expectations"" and then proceeds to not miss a note and sound better than it does on the album.. My left hand aspires to be his left hand. My right hand aspires to be Jon Schaeffer. His picking with jeffs fretting would be the best thing ever."

His work on albums through ""...And Justice for All"" is some of the best and he should be considered a pioneer, but he isn't a relevant drummer anymore. I saw them live a couple years ago when Lamb of God opened up for them and the show really should have ended there.

One of their best albums, in my opinion, is Fire up the Blades. It has some really good thrash and great drumming. They also have an interesting way they do their vocals. They have two singers. One to do the clean higher-end vocals, en-kin to Rob Halford and the other one to do the low-end growler style vocals. This makes for some really great sounds when the harmonize. Their songs do tend to be on the short side but that's just nit picking.

"I've listened to a lot of '80s thrash metal. May I have some recommendations for newer thrash metal bands to listen to?","Technically speaking... Thrash metal is Heavy metal and punk mixed together. Literally? It's fast paced, aggressive, more raw and dissonant sounding, low shredding riffs with soaring solo's, and with either high pitched wirey vocals (i.e, early exodus) or harsher growly-ish vocals (i.e. warbringer). The description for thrash is in the sidebar i just reworded it.

First off, Rammstein isn't metal at all, Pantera can be catagorized as thrash but most metal heads (or maybe just me) like to put them in their own genre (Groove metal), and AILD is Melodic Metal-core. I haven't heard anything past their 3rd CD, but when Shadows are Security came out it got pretty lame. Looking back with the taste's in music i have now, it was all pretty lame."

"I've listened to a lot of '80s thrash metal. May I have some recommendations for newer thrash metal bands to listen to?","They are a metal band. They produce mostly metal music. They have produced some non metal music but that makes them no less of a metal band. Get off your high horse and deal with it. I don't even like rammstein. I think they're a horribly over rated band. But still metal. "
"I've listened to a lot of '80s thrash metal. May I have some recommendations for newer thrash metal bands to listen to?","I'm may be on a high horse, but they are not a metal band. They could have been at some point in their career but they are not now. As you said, just flip-flopped.. Just because you produce some metal music doesn't make you metal. 

Just googled and listened to 8 rammstein songs and came to the same conclusion that they are not metal. Industrial/Hard Rock with metal influences? Sure, but...

If making playing triplets/shredding with a distorted guitar tone (over usually one riff per song), some heavy drums, and dark sounding vocals is all you need to be metal in your eyes then so be it.

Everyone wants to be metal, it takes something special to actually be."
"I've listened to a lot of '80s thrash metal. May I have some recommendations for newer thrash metal bands to listen to?","Whatever dude I can't be bothered to argue. You can believe that shit if you want to. But just know. You're a fucking idiot. "
"I've listened to a lot of '80s thrash metal. May I have some recommendations for newer thrash metal bands to listen to?","Maybe you shouldn't start things you don't care to finish? It's OK though, I know how the internet works. You can't be ""bothered"" and call me an idiot to cop out of the argument that you started because it's so easy to do so over this series of tubes. Take this time to reflect, listen to, and spread the word of some real metal instead of trying to defend bands that think they can desecrate and consume a genre, that is so brilliant, into the mainstream like Rammstein.

"Is thrash stuck in the past?","Are modern thrash bands just dreaming of the glory days?

Bands like gama bomb and municipal waste sing about the past, wishing that thrash was back rather than making it so. It seems that modern thrash vocalists speak the vocals rather than roaring them out and lack the sort of passion for the genre that used to exist. If anyone can prove me wrong then I would love it but I cannot find a modern band who get me as excited as Megadeth or Testament, and THRASH is not just speed, it is aggresion, technicality, intelligence and passion. 


This isn't a derogatory post, I hope to discover bands that thrill me, like [zergoth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYzAZvXSFbs) (who I am not affiliated with) Please tell me who sparks your interest in real thrash."
"Is thrash stuck in the past?","Skeletonwitch is the freshest modern thrash that I've ever experienced."
"Is thrash stuck in the past?","I've noticed that nothing... NOTHING... in newer thrash has matched the apocalyptic malevolence of [Darkness Descends era Dark Angel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEWLbgqCkUk). It's a kind of classic evil. Not terribly blasphemous our outrageously heavy, but as evil as it can sound while still being fun. It's lost on newer thrash.

As far as being unique, [HeXeN](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTTm1VVkOCQ) doesn't rip too hard off the 80's. It's quite technical too-like a Megadeth/Coroner hybrid."
"Is thrash stuck in the past?","I think most people agree that the majority of thrash bands nowadays just rehash the same old 80s sound, and a lot of it isn't that great.  I still like some of the new wave bands (especially Warbringer).  
If you like fresh sounding modern thrash, surely you've heard [Vektor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7G7iYCxK9U), no???"
"Is thrash stuck in the past?","The problem is simple. Thrash metal is extremely fucking hard to do well.

It's not easy. When I started this subreddit, I expected tons of bands to be able to achieve the same level of melody, rhythm, riffs, solos, technicality, excitement, song structure as famous bands like Megadeth, Metallica, Anthrax. Nope. It's unbelievably rare.

It makes me appreciate thrash giants even more. It's hard to find a good band. I have yet to discover a good one that is newer or younger guitarists. Lately, I've only been listening to rammstein and that's not even thrash, but they've figured out how to make good metal rock songs of the quality I have grown to expect."
"Is thrash stuck in the past?","[deleted]"
"Is thrash stuck in the past?","I quite like hearing thrash bands who sound like they're stuck in the mid-late 80s.[ Have some Violator.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmU3e84nVC0)"
"Is thrash stuck in the past?","Testament's Formation of Damnation and Dark Roots of Earth albums are both awesome, and feel modern to me. More importantly, they feel *alive*, they actually have genuine energy. I got into Testament late, with TFOD, and have gone back to the older stuff since, The Gathering and The Ritual are great too. The thing with Testament is that they are still reaching, still trying. DROE in particular has many little layers and fills, etc. with makes things melodic and interesting. Seriously, listen to their last two albums with headphones, then switch the headphones around, it sounds quite different because there are so many harmonies and extra fills spread around. Awesome!

It's pretty safe to say that Dave Mustaine has written more awesome music as an individual than anyone in the big four, he's pretty much been the driving force in Megadeth since day one. That is a huge feat. That said, Megadeth's energy has been going down ever since United Abominations.  There are still some great riffs on Thirteen, but it just feels formulaic. Play this part four times, then this part, repeat. Funny though, I've only had two CD's in the car for the past year; a Megadeth mix CD and Sepultura's Arise. Ahh the good stuff.

Death Magnetic was a good return to form for Metallica, but was a production nightmare in my opinion. I listened to it like crazy when it came out, but these days I never do. Oddly enough it's like it hasn't aged well. The stripped down, ultra compressed sound just gets grating after a while, and the songs are just too fucking long, they tried to hard with that aspect. I hope it's like Megadeth's The World needs a hero; not quite back on course, but turning in the right direction. I actually liked the Load era stuff, it's just not what you expect from them, not metal per-se (which is totally fine). I couldn't even watch the behind the scenes stuff for DM. It felt like the band was just floating through the process, with a bunch of smug kids at the production controls. Kind of embarrasing. Metallica and Megadeth would both be better off musically if they just played what they felt like, regardless of genre, and shed a bunch of the business/production shit that they have gotten way too comfortable with.

Never really got deep into Anthrax or Slayer, but I like a bunch of their stuff too.

These critisisms are just musings of a fan, who am I to judge anyway? I would still kill to see any of these bands live. They are the keystone bands that define the genre for a reason. They are fucking awesome."
"Is thrash stuck in the past?","Same story for Black Metal. I've been racking my fucking brain for years trying to come up with the next evolution... That is, an admirable evolution, not a cross-mixing of ten different genres. What will be next level, the thrash, the death, the black... These amazing foundations were set by pioneers... So what the fuck is wrong with my generation?! AARGH!!!"
"Is thrash stuck in the past?","I think maybe the problem is, back in the day, people had less distractions. In the 80s, you learned guitar, and played for hours and hours, you jammed with people who did the same. Now--too many distractions. 

I don't know for sure if that is why new GOOD metal artists are hard to find."
"Is thrash stuck in the past?","What about Vektor?"
"Is thrash stuck in the past?","Now, I am a huge fan of this band, so this is a bit biased, but [Tantara](http://soundcloud.com/indierecordings/tantara-based-on-evil) really gives me the old thrash vibe, without sounding like a rehash of the 80's. Interesting riffs, good lyrics with relevant themes and they're guys that really tend to their fans in a good way.

I also like the two newest albums by Overkill. I really enjoy the more fast-paced thrash with aggressive drums and riffing, and that is exactly what those albums offer. Granted, I haven't heard much of the old Overkill, so I don't know if it their newest efforts are really similiar to their old stuff, but it was really something new and exciting for me the first time I heard them."
"Is thrash stuck in the past?","Check out Possessor.  www.facebook.com/possessormetal"
"Is thrash stuck in the past?","I completely agree I think that this entire genre (thrash metal) needs a evolution! Were definitely just repeating all the same stuff that happened in the 80's just without the same amount of energy. I think we need a new generation of rockers with much more enthusiasm!!!

There's also my band Split the Abyss, we're a clusterfuck of a few things such as sadus, demoliton hammer and hail of bullets. It's getting stronger and stronger every year as well."

Still wish Baloff was around, mind you."
"Exodus-Salt the Wound","Souza is my favourite of Exodus's vocalists myself.He's really hit and miss with lyrics, I agree. Cheesy as fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. I saw them with Dukes as well and just thought he came off as a dick wad. As far as I've seen, he's a nice as fuck dude, but on stage, he just seems like an obnoxious idiot. I'm glad Souza is back in the fold. Great vocalist, and he doesn't seem like a moron on stage. Baloff is great, and I'll get shit for this I'm sure, but vocally, he isn't my favourite. He had the attitude sure, but man, listening to BBB can be hard sometimes because they have his vocals buried in so much reverb to make him sound good. He came off so much better live. Like the live in Dynamo right before Pleasures was released and before Souza, he sounds fucking bad ass there. If he had pulled that off on the album, that would have been so good. The reverb being gone makes him so much better.  "

"Metallica - Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge (Seattle 1989)","I have to disagree. Metallica is the new KISS. They have some sort of merch for everything now. It's not a band, it's a brand. They are mailing it in, and have been for at least a decade. I love this band, but I won't even go see them live anymore. James still has that wicked downstroke riff, but his voice is flat out gone. The grit is non-existent. I mean I know why, huge tour after black album, blah blah. Kirk is pentatonic with a wah pedal, and still has most his parts written for him. Lars... well, we won't go there. Everyone knows. And Rob has zero business being in this band. Go back to ST and Infectious Grooves. And his basketball jersey ""costume"" and cheesy flame job basses really bother me, no idea why. Just seems so 1999 to me. Decent player, wrong band.

And the downtuning. Oh the downtuning. Biggest disappointment yet. Honestly, if you're at they age where you have to change the key of songs, and water down drum parts, it's time to hang it up. Especially in a metal band. A former ""thrash"" metal band at that.

I'm hardcore. I still have my battle jacket from 1986 with the original Damage Inc. backpatch. I just wish they would call it a day before I become even more embarrassed to own it. To me a Metallica fan in the eighties meant no one fucked with you. We were an army. Now it's not just becoming soft, it's becoming a joke and it seriously breaks my heart.

All Nightmare Long is pretty decent and the Full Arsenal Tour was cool though. Got to see Doris again.

And while I don't hate them, it made me cringe to think of them on someone's thrash list. But then of course it wasn't them. So all was good.

I never really did care for that track though, I mean the glam rock Slaughter one you posted. But some of their other stuff wasn't too bad. Mike Slaughter had a decent voice when he wasn't trying to make your dog howl. If he'd have kept from the high pitched shit they would have been at least decent."

"A friend of mine sent me a list of thrash bands to check out. Thought I'd share with /r/thrashmetal.","How could you think Sodom is not thrash metal? 

* Fast aggressive tempos, low-register, complex guitar riffs, high-register guitar solos and double bass drumming.

* Tempo, abrupt riff changes.

* High mid-tones on distortion.

* Vocally, anything from melodic singing to shouted vocals.

* Most thrash guitar solos are played at high speed

* Often influenced by the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement and punk elements.

* Thrash tends to have an accelerating feel

* Drumming: two bass drums, double-bass pedal for tempo

Sodom has ALL of those dude. Sodom is clearly a Thrash Metal^TM band. I can't even think of a counter argument. "

"Thrash Basses","Hey all,

I am a bassist (primarily thrash, prog and jazz) and wanted to get some ideas of a new bass for gigging with the thrashness. I have about $1000ish AUD to spend so nothing too extreme. Also not a mass fan of weird shapes or V's or similar on bass. Cheers in advance."
"Thrash Basses","I've got a Warwick Corvette from 2004 and it plays like a dream. Bought it used for 500 USD from Guitar Center. It's got a bit of that Jaco low end sound and the high end is a bit edgier than Claypool's main bass. Heavy as fuck though."
"Thrash Basses","Cheers man, that's pretty much exactly what I was looking for"
"Thrash Basses","You can get a decent Rickenbacker for about $1000 (USD, I'm really sorry, but I'm unaware of the current currency exchange). I've never personally played one, but Cliff Burton and Lemmy can't be wrong.

As for personal experience, I have an Ibanez (well under $1000 USD) and it fuckin smokes.

"
"Thrash Basses","Yeah man I've considered the good ol Rickers but there is nowhere really around here that sells them. I would have to import it from either the us or europe which would most likely cost as much as the bass haha. Thanks anyway mate."
"Thrash Basses","Get a P-bass, that is what the guy from Anthrax plays.  They growl really well."
"Thrash Basses","Yeah played a couple, nice basses but not really what I was looking for. Thanks anyway dude."
"Thrash Basses","Thunderbirds are heavy but they have the thrash growl and really nice necks."
"Thrash Basses","The Yamaha RBXJM2 works quite well for me, but is controversial. Some people love it, some hate it. The string spacing is relatively narrow, and slapping is relatively hard. it has a growly sound, and the built-in EQ means that you might need a pre-amp when you want to use effects. It doesn't have very well defined heights. On the plus side, it is ridiculously easy to play, string spacing is relatively narrow, there are six strings, and it has a growly sound. I played Prog and normal metal with it. I wouldn't want to play a four-stringer again. I didn't utilise the high C much, but having the low B is brilliant in metal I think."

"Metallica - Hit the Lights [No Life 'Til Leather] - Metallica's first song, happy birthday James Hetfield","Thrash metal is speed metal with more speed, aggression, anger, and distortion. 

This album was a pivotal moment in the beginnings of a new genre: Thrash metal.

The recording quality isn't as good as Kill 'Em All and that's the difference you might be noticing."

The critics at the time had called it ""the true birth of thrash"".

One also said ""it also captures thrash on the cusp of blowing up"" and ""it became, for better or worse, the benchmark against which early thrash [album] would be measured""

This album, Kill 'Em All, is what true thrash metal is all about, fast riffs, aggression, anger, driving tempo, tempo changes, distortion, punk-rock song structures melding it with heavy metal. It is the definition of thrash metal."
