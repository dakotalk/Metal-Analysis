"It's so quiet in here...","Oh, is that so?  Tell me then, how did it die? You seem pretty knowledgeable based on your post. "
"It's so quiet in here...","How does anything die? Too many low-quality bands that don't understand the genre making pale imitations."
"It's so quiet in here...","What is black metal?

Forgive the lateness of the replies, I'm in a very busy state, catering to the rats, I will attempt replies as I am able. I am most interested in a serious discussion on this issue.

The linked bands I gave, how are they ""low-quality pale imitations""? I am curious, I am not attacking you.

Low quality to me means Cradle of Filth or some such bullshit passing as ""kvlt"" &amp; such popular interweb scene BS. 

To me, black metal must be black, elitist, and most importantly; anti-human. 

I do enjoy the old ""true"" black metal bands of the early 90's as much as the next nobody, but surely the spirit of black metal hasn't died. We are still here, frowning, existing. We aren't popular, we never really intended that.

wtfimdrunk, trying to make sense, nite
 

"
"It's so quiet in here...","I should have made clear I do not know most of the bands you linked.

Black metal is epic melodic atmospheric death metal, if you want a one-line definition.

It's form of Romantic art, like Blake, Bruckner, Goethe, Wordsworth, et al.

Anything that falls short of that, or too far short of these classics, is probably not worth the time:

* Immortal - Pure Holocaust
* Emperor - Wrath of the Tyrant
* Burzum - Det Som Engang Var
* Rotting Christ - Thy Mighty Contract
* Gorgoroth - Antichrist
* Enslaved - Vikinglgr Veldi
* Mayhem - De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas

These bands are intense.

Most post-1994 black metal is like post-1985 hardcore, form without content and thus, has no real atmosphere or intensity."

"HELLS HEADBANGERS 2lp Comp - SLAYER Homage/tribute artwork","http://imageshack.us/a/img687/3556/hellsheadbangerscompila.jpg

""Following, in the footsteps of and paying tribute to the 80's Metal Underground, Hells Headbangers Records has compiled and unleashed a compilation that acts not only as a taste of what the label has to offer, but also showcasing many of the underground Metal Scene's up and coming bands that may have gone under the radar otherwise.

HHR has brought forth into the modern day Metal scene the idea and belief that no matter if a release is that of a single band, that it should be presented with the same care of a normal (for lack of a better term) release. Refusing to hastily slapping together a Cd sampler with random tracks and little to no artwork, HHR has reinstated the presentation of the compilation sampler being no different than any other release under bearing their logo.

With that in mind, the label approached the multi-talented underground artist, label boss and musician Antichrist Kramer to create the artwork to this release. The idea was to, and is to follow on all subsequent future compilations from the label, present the compilation with a reworking of and homage to a classic and highly iconic and recognizable Metal cover artwork from the past, albeit with the entire text and aesthetic changed to that of HHR and their Demon headed mascot.

HHR decided that the perfect album to pay respect and honor to for the first of the new Compilation releases, was one of the most influential and groundbreaking Extreme Metal albums of all time: SLAYER's ""Show No Mercy"". An album that all involved feel encompasses every single aspect of what Metal is, should and forever will be. The idea was presented to Kramer (of whom when asked, ranked SLAYER's ""Show No Mercy"" as his personal favorite album hands down and ""most important album of all time, regardless of artist or genre""), and within the span of weeks, he created a piece that not only at first glance replicates the entire artwork flawlessly, but delivered a piece of art that has the same initial impact of that which it pays honor to.

Drawn, inked and colored completely by hand without a single touch of a computer program, Kramer delivered exactly what HHR were looking for. The original piece was created with pen and ink, colored pencil, markers and watercolor, and brings to the feeling and aesthetic of the original artwork to life in a way that computer generated artwork can never ever replicate. The SLAYER album and its artwork were created at the dawn of the birth of Extreme Metal, and for those there during this time period, it is greatly agreed upon that the feelings and powerful ideas that were coming to fore at this time can never be explained fully nor captured in this day and age. HHR and Kramer have absolutely done so with this release.

Replacing the key elements of the artwork with those of the label, the artwork is now re-imagined as a new piece, yet still wholly familiar and exacting in its presentation. The Baphomet creature is now replaced with the HHR Demon whose belt buckle now says ""HHR"", the sword pentagram now with ""HHR"" entangled within, and the devil tailed blazing album title now reads ""Hells Headbangers"". This artwork will most assuredly be remembered and seen as one of the all time best reworkings/homage/tribute pieces in all of Metal. No matter who you are, what micro-genre you are into, SLAYER and ""Show No Mercy"" in particular, influenced you, either directly or indirectly. Hells Headbangers Records and Antichrist Kramer proudly proclaim this with this modern day soon to be classic release.

HHR made sure to let the public know that this artwork and idea was completed and done before Hanneman's passing, and that Kramer delivered the final piece to HHR mered DAYS before news broke of the tragic event. Whether or not unseen forces and hands had a play in this will never be known, but what is known for sure is that a more fitting tribute could not have been made.

The compilation consists of 20 TRACKS IN TOTAL, and features brand new songs from upcoming albums by MIDNIGHT, WITCH CROSS, PROFANATICA, IMPIETY as well as material from earlier releases in 2013 and mid-late 2012. Many may have received this album in Cd format as a added bonus early in the summer when ordering from the label, but with the format and presentation that it now is being presented within, makes it a ""must have"" release regardless or not if you already have the free Cd version. Seeing the artwork at the at close to full scale that it was created at, along with the massive A2 poster featuring the same, allows one to appreciate the detail and devotion that went in to this piece on a level that was not possible on the Cd format. That alone is worth the price of admission.

Released and now for sale for a mere $12, with the option of purchasing with an accompanying Lp slipmat featuring the artwork, this amazing release is now available for worldwide shipping. Absolutely buy this release and support the label and artist, as this is Metal to the fucking bone, and a release such as this came at a time when it was greatly needed. 'Nuff said.

One final note, HHR and Kramer have informed me that the label and artist are working on more reworkings of classic albums for future compilations now, with the next cover to be ""done and in the hands of HHR soon"". None would divulge what the cover that is being paid tribute to is, but the one thing anyone can know for sure is that whatever it is, it will be something jaw dropping."" - Michael Sanchez for The Metal Underground Radio Show

I am already working on the next compilation cover, and it will be done shortly after the new year. HHR and I have many plans for what bands/albums will be paid tribute to on these compilations. Support to HELLS HEADBANGERS RECORDS eternally....

""Wolf cross is found in Iceland, dated to about 900 AD One can not say with certainty to what meaning the wolf cross had. There are several theories: - An extremely stylized Thor's hammer. - A mixture of Thor's hammer and the Christian cross. - In case of navigation. That in the middle of the cross was mounted a so-called ""Sunstone"" Vikings used iolite stone, also known as ""sunstone"" for navigation. It acts as a polarizer and one can with the help of this blue stone determine the sun's location at the overcast weather."""

"Lord Wind - Atlantean Monument review with legal MP3 samples","Hmm, I'll try to get more submissions to this subreddit. Although I dislike ANUS, a subreddit where people read ANUS has to be intellegent. The thing about ANUS is the needless verbosity. There is no reason to express ideas in such a manner unless you are trying to show that you are intellectually superior or else trying to write poetry. If it is trying to be poetic, then it is quite pathetic, so I just have to assume that they are trying to pretend they are intellectually superior by using bigger words. The website just screams ""My cock is larger than yours."" For example:

&gt; His technique combines the modern fascination with layers, or repeated complimentary patterns started at different times, and the ancient concept of recursion, where each repetition participates in the re-uptake of information from its context, finally forming a synthesis. 

The ""re-uptake of information from its context""? Even I don't know exactly what that is suppossed to mean. Definitely not musical terminology, which is generally the best way to present ideas in a music review. And isn't layering a form of recursion? Take part, add complimentary part, making new part. Repeat. So what, is this a synthesis between 2 things which are the exact same? Or is the reviewer saying there is a synthesis between the parts, thus making this whole sentence twice rednudant? 

What he could have said is ""*This music uses the technique of layering, or adding in complimentary repeating parts at different times, in a manner which produces a strong synthesis between the combined parts.*"" He could then go on to say ""*His use of the looping structures in a narrative fashion is a nod to classical and baroque structures*"" instead of the next monstrosity of a sentence. Of course, that isn't a nod to classical and baroque structures at all (at most a nod to the concept of counterpoint), but at least it would be a sentence that makes sense and isn't difficult to read. 

Maybe ANUS hides their ideas in abstruse rhetoric in order to filter out the idiots, but for me at least it also filters out the fun of earnest intellectual conversations without pretensiousness, but rather just the exchange of ideas."
"Lord Wind - Atlantean Monument review with legal MP3 samples","I think it's designed to be semi-poetic.

They write more about it here:

http://www.anus.com/metal/about/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=63"
"Lord Wind - Atlantean Monument review with legal MP3 samples","&gt; He dazzled them with his never-ending vocabulary, and I think this actually helped them understand what he said: They had to make sense of it before reacting.

That's actually a very interesting idea. It doesn't seem to be true, most people just look at an ANUS review, scratch their heads, and leave. I imagine it's the same with people like buckley. I would love for a site that doesn't insult it's readers but rather expects intelligence from them. That doesn't mean to me that you have do do it the way ANUS does it. I think you're right that it is supposed to be semi-poetic. Perhaps it'd be nicer if they just ditched all pretense and wrote poems for their reviews? I like how they argue that they are following the traditions of other metal bands by using such latinate technical words. It seems great when I read their defense of it, but then I look at those reviews, and no, it isn't really. I think of the einstein quote: ""Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."" Of course, it isn't true all the time, but I think as a rule of thumb it really helps."

Beast Death Master - 動物のファックろくでなし

NS depressive doom/black metal. Their demo is rad and reminds me of if Burzum had Masonna on vocals and played Hawaiian guitar interludes on meth using Corrupted's guitars.

Lord of Glass Shards - Great Death List for Nonbelievers

Austrian by the numbers Der Sturmer worship and dirty sounding NSBM which incorporates folk music and occassional yodeling(?) sounds in the background. They were recently banned from playing a number of Vienese venues for passing out an actual death list for people they wanted to kill.

Cicatriz Arayansk - Undichte Tod

Salvadoran punk NSBM with awesome samples and some really killer riffs. Sounds like some of the run of the mill Absurd influences but also they punk it up with discharge d-beat assaults.

Grave of Hitler - गुड़िया के साथ खेल

Black/death warmetal NSBM which reminds me of Blasphemy mixed with Convulse groove and also really crazy drum machine solos (??!) from Germany.

Deathkey88's black metal side project. Ripping electronics mixed with insane riffing and spectacular old school Mayhem chainsaw gutsfuck sludginess. Sounded like it was recorded in a dead infant's butt.
