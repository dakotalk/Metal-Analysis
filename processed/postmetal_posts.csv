"(Cult of Luna - Vertikal I&amp;II) /r/prog gave this no love, so fuck them. This is apparently where good music is posted.",""
"(Cult of Luna - Vertikal I&amp;II) /r/prog gave this no love, so fuck them. This is apparently where good music is posted.","Definitely the most mature work from Cult of Luna in my opinion, a concept perfectly developed along the whole record. It just give me chills when I hear those 6 notes from the first track repeated with that futuristic tone during the entire Vertikal to the whispering way on Passing Through and Vertikal II. They should have included the EP content in the original record tho, it woulda been perfect."

"(Cult of Luna - Vertikal I&amp;II) /r/prog gave this no love, so fuck them. This is apparently where good music is posted.","I still listen to Vertikal about 3 times a week. A lot of listeners don't pick up on the repeated theme but I think it goes further. In my view opening track 'O R O' from Vertikal II echoes the same pulsating start as 'The One' from Vertikal and the same theme that returns three more times in the full length album (listen to them side by side). Yes there are clean vocals and the instrumentation is heavy but not as heavy as 'The One'. Then, before you know it, 'O R O' transforms into an adaptation of the closing minutes of  'Passing Through', also from Vertikal and the fourth time we hear the theme on the album, albeit in truncated form. The last part of the song is essentially 'The Sweep'; the second encounter with the theme on the album. Both recordings came from five years of gestation, so rather than an out-take from the Vertikal sessions the song is like a thumbnail sketch, or more accurately the genesis of Vertikal. Or perhaps they simply crawled out of the primordial soup together. "

"(Cult of Luna - Vertikal I&amp;II) /r/prog gave this no love, so fuck them. This is apparently where good music is posted.","Honestly, I gave Vertikal a good chance but it definitely doesn't rank alongside Somewhere or Eternal. There are multiple great tracks but as a whole it just doesn't do it for me.

Having said that, I really want to listen to them right now so I will put on some stuff."

"Maeth - Horse Funeral","Awesome jams man, keep it up!"
"Maeth - Horse Funeral","Found you guys on some /mu/ thread a while ago when Oceans Into Ashes was released. Needless to say, I'm still high on Maeth.

Great stuff. "
"Maeth - Horse Funeral","Wait, do you say it where the a is almost silent? How is it supposed to be said?"
"Maeth - Horse Funeral","We say ""May-ith."" Does that make sense? It's kind of a bad band name for the reasons illuminated in this thread. It comes from ancient Hebrew, and we're mispronouncing it too. We decided it sounded more aesthetic or something. "
"Maeth - Horse Funeral","I always used to say it with a silent ""a"", sort of like one would say ""meth"" (obvious, given the context). Your response got me wondering how it was originally meant to be pronounced, though.. My best guess would be ""meth"", because the music is pretty stonerish and it sounds pretty edgy that way."
"Maeth - Horse Funeral","Your band deserves more attention. I have already listened to 'oceans into ashes' and I loved it. 'Burning turquoise' and 'troodon' are just amazing, and 'nomad' is pretty good too. Please, keep up with the good work, cheers from Portugal."

"Maeth - Wolves [6:01] Progressive/Post-Metal with kickass flute","Why didn't you just make your link to BC in the first place? It embeds with RES.

Anyways this isn't post-metal. It would fit better on /r/stonermetal"
"Maeth - Wolves [6:01] Progressive/Post-Metal with kickass flute","For mobile and non-RES users. I did put the Bandcamp link for the whole album in the comment, so it's conveniently available both ways. "
"Maeth - Wolves [6:01] Progressive/Post-Metal with kickass flute","Bandcamp is *far* more preferable on mobile than Youtube. Why would anyone on a phone want to stream a video when they can just load some HTML5 music?"
"Maeth - Wolves [6:01] Progressive/Post-Metal with kickass flute","I don't know if you've noticed, but no one else on this sub really cares about strict genre definitions."
"Maeth - Wolves [6:01] Progressive/Post-Metal with kickass flute","I find that people mostly post post-metal. This isn't a matter of being strict. This is blatantly not post-metal and there's another sub where it's more appropriate."
"Maeth - Wolves [6:01] Progressive/Post-Metal with kickass flute","&gt;  This is blatantly not post-metal and there's another sub where it's more appropriate.

I disagree with this. The alternating light and heavy sections, the complexity of the structure, the lengthy running time, and the de-emphasis on vocals are post-metal hallmarks. Is it 100% post metal? No, there are multiple influences in there. But it's 2013 and bands can't just remake Oceanic or At The Soundless Dawn every two years. 

I'm pretty sure if I posted it to /r/stonermetal someone there would have told me it isn't slow enough or tune low enough. If it really doesn't belong here, the mods can remove it. "
"Maeth - Wolves [6:01] Progressive/Post-Metal with kickass flute","&gt; The alternating light and heavy sections, the complexity of the structure, the lengthy running time, and the de-emphasis on vocals are post-metal hallmarks.

None of those are things that define the genre. That's like saying something is post-rock if there's a crescendo that leads into an explosive climax.

I do think it's possible that post-metal was an influence on this bands sound as it was pretty varied across the album but I heard more post-rock in there than sludge metal."
"Maeth - Wolves [6:01] Progressive/Post-Metal with kickass flute","As a member of this band it makes me really happy that people are fighting over what genre we are rather than calling us a Neurosis/Isis ripoff. What can we do to be more post-metal for you? (check all that apply)
_ More delay
_ More scramz
_ More beards (I'm looking at you, Steve)
_ More literature references
_ More vinyl
_ Fewer riffs
_ Fewer pinch harmonics 
_ Fewer songs under 10 minutes
_ Fewer songs
_ Fewer live shows
"
"Maeth - Wolves [6:01] Progressive/Post-Metal with kickass flute","Don't worry about our petty arguments. What you're doing right now is just fine.. 

Actually, now that I think about it, the monologue in Blackdamp was a little off-putting, but everything else was great.
"
"Maeth - Wolves [6:01] Progressive/Post-Metal with kickass flute","None of those things make it more post-metal and you don't sound like a Neurosis/Isis ripoff at all. I just think that it was a mistake of OP to call this post-metal in the first place. You shouldn't try to be more post-metal. Do what you want. Let us try and classify it."
"Maeth - Wolves [6:01] Progressive/Post-Metal with kickass flute","I knew what you meant dude just havin' fun."
"Maeth - Wolves [6:01] Progressive/Post-Metal with kickass flute","No, I'm with Given. That's a fairly accurate description for such a nebulous genre."
"Maeth - Wolves [6:01] Progressive/Post-Metal with kickass flute","Considering the big post-rock influence I'd say that the structures are basic. Complex structures would be found in stuff like prog and not sludge metal and post-metal. Alternating light and heavy is also not essential to the genre and neither is long songs. I would say that most post-metal bands emphasize the vocals as much as any other atmospheric genre.

I don't see how describing what a few bands do is an accurate description of the genre. Like I said, it's like saying something is post-rock because it follows the explosions in the sky style. It's very dangerous and limiting to have such a narrow scope.

Post-metal is essentially atmospheric sludge metal.  It's sludge metal with post-rock influences. Before the term was widely accepted (a very recent thing) these bands would always be lumped in with sludge."

* Lightbearer - Lapsus
* Mouth of the Architect - Quietly
* North- Ruins or What you Were

If we're throwing Lightbearer on there I'd toss on Mammal by Altar of Plauges as well and if they're gonna let Alcest pass then Sunbather is also a pretty good torch-passing album between a few genres that deserves recognition even if people *hate* the way it's been labeled.  "

Anxiously awaiting the inevitable  announcement if their Salt Lake City listening party... ;-)"

Great track though. The album should be spectacular."
"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","Well I figured I'd shoot the gap and post it here. Actually is it really that far of a stretch to call it post-metal? I mean what is post-metal if not a combination of post-rock and metal? Is it inappropriate to loosely refer to a combination of post-rock and black metal as post-metal? And, yeah I really hadn't heard much of these guys before, but this song's fucking spectacular."

"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","Post-metal is essentially atmospheric sludge. It is not just any combination of post-rock and metal.

The term you're looking for is post-black metal.

http://www.last.fm/tag/post-black%20metal"
"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","That's not what Wikipedia says. Haha, but regardless, I don't think it's that important. I know what the genre ""is"". It seems a bit on the needlessly specific side to me. And there's not even a post-black metal sub. 

Edit: Maybe it's not that nit picky or overly specific, but I still maintain that it's not a stretch to use post-metal as a general blanket term for them. As they blend a type of metal with post-rock."
"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","&gt;As they blend a type of metal with post-rock.

Which is not what post-metal means. -_-

Anyways, there isn't a post-black sub, but post-black is still allowed (and liked if it's not popular) on /r/blackmetal."
"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","[Hey man, the internet doesn't lie!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-metal)"
"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.",""" Isis, who like Neurosis are linked to the sludge metal scene""

Hurr durr. The wikipedia article is written like shit. Ever read the article on emo and seen how bad that is? They try and incorporate the MTVEmo term and it's a huge mess."
"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","Yeah, Neurosis and Isis are pretty sludgy. I mean Souls at Zero and everything prior were all more hardcore and sludge influenced right? Even stuff after that was as well. I'm not trying to really say anything against the pioneers of the genre having roots in different genres of metal. Also, there's no way you can dispute the validity of [THIS](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120208184840AAYL1e7). Read it and weep, chump."
"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","Souls at Zero definitely has that hardcore influence but no one considered Neurosis post-metal at that point. It was after that (with Through Silver in Blood) when they adopted that. Though personally I think that's a bit of a Talk Talk situation where you could argue that they weren't the first band in the genre they were just the ones that moved music as a whole into creating the genre when they influenced others."
"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","Also, if you're unhappy with the wiki article and you think it's inaccurate, you could look into rewriting and correcting it."
"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","They'd likely not allow the edit because no sources were cited and revert it even though no sources indicate that the genres listed are what are part of post-metal. The article even goes on to say: "" post-metal contain many elements similar to doom metal, progressive metal, sludge metal, and stoner metal. ""

Why they don't include this from the get go is beyond me."
"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","It probably should mention it earlier. If I recall correctly though they refer to a few of those that you quoted as related topics or something in the box at the at the top right. I could be wrong though."

"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","Yeah those purists over at /r/blackmetal will probably have a field day. They'll probably try and claim it doesn't fit on their Reddit,  then they'll go on to say that the wikipedia article regarding post-metal is inaccurate, or poorly written.  That's what those dummies over there will do.  Not like us here though... We are so much smarter.
"
"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","Do you think Wikipedia is a legitimate source? I'm not sure what you're getting at here. Deafheaven is clearly a BM band. At least, until we here the rest of this album."
"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","Apparently, I'm the only one who found your statements incredibly ironic.  No I don't think Wikipedia is a legitimate source, but you apparently do, as you used it to backup  the argument that only bands based in sludge can be considered post-metal.

What I was getting at was your ""not in my backyard"" attitude. That despite appealing to many users here (one of the most up-voted posts on /r/postmetal) and sharing many attributes with what purists (such as yourself) consider post-metal, you suggest that it  isn't pure enough to be posted here and instead should be used as fodder to irritate the purist users of the black metal reddit.

Instead, perhaps someone should make a post-black metal reddit so you can troll that too."
"Deafheaven premiere new song, ""Dream House"" on NPR.","&gt;as you used it to backup the argument that only bands based in sludge can be considered post-metal.

I don't think you followed that argument very closely. The other guy was using wikipedia to point out how post-metal *isn't* sludge + post-rock and was rather just ""metal + post-rock."" I then used the wikipedia article itself to point out the inconsistency of the way it's written and how it later on has 2 direct references to sludge.

People will upvote anything if it's on topic or not. Just look at whenever someone posts Explosions in the Sky on /r/postrock. Everyone bitches about it in teh comments because it's the most obvious thing ever to post but it gets half a million upvotes. The same thing happens with Burzum on /r/blackmetal. Upvotes seem to come from people who aren't very involved in the community and don't match care for topicality or if it's anything interesting.

Plain and simple: This isn't post-metal in any way. "

Harakiri For the Sky - Aokigahara

Alcest - Shelter

Les Discrets - untitled 2014

Not 'post-metal' per se but the new Baroness record might see light this year and it's definitely got some post-metal elements there

And new Mogwai should be fun"
"What are your most anticipated post-metal albums of 2014?","Mogwai already leaked and they're not anywhere close to metal. Isn't Solstafir that Icelandic prog metal band?

Alcest leaked and apparently it's not metal, either. You can tell that from the songs that have all been released anyways.

Les Discrets doesn't make post-metal. He makes something closer to post-rock and shoegaze. Just because his other projects are metal doesn't make all of his projects metal.

Harikari for the sky is post-black metal/blackgaze.

"Earthrise - Eras Lost (Sludgy Post-Metal, Name your own price download)","This is why I normally use stupid adjectives like ""slow, drunk, chuggy, spacey, etc..."" to define our band to people. Unfortunately reddit doesn't have a r/drunkconvergehavingsexwithisis subreddit so I'm out of luck!"
"Earthrise - Eras Lost (Sludgy Post-Metal, Name your own price download)","I suppose you are right! Genre tags are so hard to define accurately these days... I would say that post metal includes sludgy aspects, as well as lots of melodic and atmospheric qualities. In terms of ""post-metal"" we lean on the slow, groove oriented, chuggy side of post-metal. That's what I meant mostly. Valid argument though! You obviously know your shit. I definitely don't claim to be a master in the subject :-p.

edit: reworded"
"Suggestions for instrumental albums?","To each his own.  I love Australasia and March Into the Sea is a close second for me.  The Fire In Our Throats... was fine.  I was disappointed in City of Echoes (particularly) and the rest.  I think I listened to What We All Come To Need a bit, but it didn't do much for me."
"Suggestions for instrumental albums?","Indeed, my order is almost the complete opposite. City of Echoes takes the cake for me, with What We All Come To Need and Ataraxia/Taraxis tied up for second. Then Fire In Our Throats, with Australasia coming up last.
"
"Suggestions for instrumental albums?","I see.  Well, if you like Pelican you might also enjoy [Omega Massif](http://omegamassif.bandcamp.com/).  Check them out if you haven't.  They remind me of Pelican, but I like them more, though that may be b/c they're a bit noisier and heavier (and that may be the opposite of where you'd take Pelican to improve them).  Cheers."
"Suggestions for instrumental albums?","I do know them, I have Karpatia actually. You're right though, I definitely like the more uplifting aspects of Pelican, and Omega Massif is heavier and sludgy."

* Spaces
* Cloudkicker
* If These Trees Could Talk
* T.R.A.M.
* Chimp Spanner

But a really good pure instrumental band that is metal-ish is [Jakob](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ld3c_IVmk8)"
"Suggestions for instrumental albums?","Oh I'm not saying I'm not interested! I'm a vocal major so I'm really picky about the voice. The growling in Ocean was great, but I'm not fond of his dark, throaty singing. For instance, I love cult of Luna. If there are bands that have better singing, I'd be totally down to listen to that."

"Genghis Tron - Board Up The House","Great song/album but this isn't even remotely anywhere related to post-metal. Why post it here?"
"Genghis Tron - Board Up The House","I'd say it is at least remotely post metal. They're metal that incorporates other genres of music and use synthesizers. We could argue the definition of the genre but that's good enough for me because these labels are all just fluid and made up anyway. "
"Genghis Tron - Board Up The House","&gt;They're metal that incorporates other genres of music and use synthesizers

That's not what post-metal is. I'm not even sure I would say that they have any metal in their sound.

&gt;We could argue the definition of the genre but that's good enough for me because these labels are all just fluid and made up anyway. 

What? They're only fluid when you don't know how to define the genre. Your lack of knowledge doesn't make a genre's definition any different."

&gt;I'm not even sure I would say that they have any metal in their sound.

"Genghis Tron - Board Up The House","&gt; You act like there's some official organization making up these things. There isn't. There's no official definition of post-metal. You didn't even bother to give your own definition. 

Right, so you think there's no agreed upon and widely used definition of post-metal and people can just use the term however they want even when it directly conflicts with other genres? Using your logic basically no modern genre has any official definition.

Post-metal is pretty widely defined as being an evolution of atmospheric sludge that uses elements of post-rock. Roots go all the way back to Neurosis with bands like Isis solidifying it and their label actually using the term themselves.

&gt;Did you even hear the song I posted? It has heavily distorted guitars and growl vocals. That is definitely metal style. Who is ignorant again? Why don't you know even what basic metal is?

Heavily distorted guitars? Oh, so it's shoegaze, thanks for clearing that up.

And what growling vocals? They use core vocals since they're a cybergrind band, a sub-genre of grindcore. I was listening to this band far before this album was out kiddo. These are not growling vocals."

I thought it could be some Greymachine, Godflesh (its not ""Like Rats""), or Old Man Gloom but came up empty-handed. Boy am I going to look stupid when it has nothing to do with Aaron Turner.

You can stream whole albums, you don't have to worry about transcodes and YTs piss-poor quality, you can buy it without needing any software in multiple formats, and you can listen to bands discographies if they're all uploaded. Always search there first."

Here in Salt Lake we just finished Crucial Fest, our local ""Heavy"" music festival. It was a blast, but it also got me thinking...

Do any of your hometowns, or neighboring cities have music festivals where post-metal bands are featured? 

In Salt Lake City, we have the previously mentioned Crucial Fest, which is all types of metal and punk/hardcore... We also have ""doom and gloom fest"" coming up, which is more post-metal friendly; This one sheds the punk and  adds a bit more sludge and doom.

Anything like either of these happen near you? What are you most excited to see this summer?

It needs to be headlined by the Melvins and have all the big names, eyehategod, Crowbar, Pelican, High On Fire etc.  Maybe even Mastodon and Baroness, just to get people to pay attention.

I don't get this attitude. Bands are allowed to have more than one great album even if it's not going to be their best. If someone else put out the same album you wouldn't make the comparison. Personally I thought Vertikal was the best thing they've done since Salvation."

"Cult of Luna's ""Vertikal II"" Full Album stream","It isn't an ""attitude"", it's my personal opinion. If they had made an album that I liked more I would have said/will say ""Nothing tops _______"" but for me, it's Salvation.

As for the rest of the album, the tone is similar throughout but I'd be willing to say this may be the heaviest track on the album.

"Thoughts on SunnO))) being classified as a post-metal band?","Obviously they don't fit the ISIS/Neurosis/Cult of Luna template sound-wise, but I think they could be considered post-metal in the purest interpretation of the term: music that comes after metal! Thoughts? "
"Thoughts on SunnO))) being classified as a post-metal band?","You know, I always thought it was kind of odd that people would classify it in the post-metal genre. I get the whole doom thing, but really I hear it as being straight up drone when you really take into consideration the entirety of SunnO)))'s work. You are technically right that it is music that has come after metal that isn't still specifically metal but if we are talking like that, you could say that really anything is post-metal or post-rock or post-yada yada yada forever. I can see how perhaps in the spirit of the music it might fit into post0metal but stylistically I see it really only fitting the blue print for drone and doom. Haha I guess I could probably go on and on but that's my opinion. I like SunO))) lolz"

"Thoughts on SunnO))) being classified as a post-metal band?","[deleted]"
"Thoughts on SunnO))) being classified as a post-metal band?","Post-metal is sludgey atmospheric stuff. Think Neurosis after their hardcore transition. Sunn O))) is typically classified as a drone metal band. Which comes from doom, not sludge. As cuntbitchdick points out as well."
"Thoughts on SunnO))) being classified as a post-metal band?","i think of ulver very clearly as post-metal because of their first 3 albums. but i dunno. i think sunn always sounded that same dronecore thing its been. so i guess the question is: is drone metal post metal. my personal opinion is to not label anything, the lines of influence are too broad with good bands these days. but when pushed i guess that i think drone metal is just drone metal. it's its own thing"

It's very Jesu (as most of his remixes are) with elements of the song you'd recognize and then about halfway through the vocals kick in and it starts to make a lot more sense. Then it ends on a dreamy, very JKB sort of note instead of the hard note it would normally end on."

I can see why it wasn't included on Vertikal I since it doesn't really fit in anywhere even though the overall sound fits the theme of the album. As for the structure of the song, I think it maybe would be better off cut down to 2-3 minutes and instead act as an interlude track like ""the sweep"" or ""disharmonia"". But I'm most certain it will be important for the dynamic on Vertikal II as it is. Other than that it's a really good song despite its softer approach."

"Finally got some old recordings of mine up on Bandcamp, would love some feedback!","Hi. I've listened to the Songs of Sadko and a few of the MMMMM my critical view is:  
1. the sound of your guitars is pretty good  
2. the riffs are quite fine  
3. the compositions are boring, they take 'years' to gain momentum and after they finaly 'start' there isn't much to them.  
Songs are like stories, or for better comparison like sex. In the very basic outline you need beginning/foreplay, story peak/climax, ending/relaxation. Your foreplay is too long, I never climax and then I realy don't feel a need to rest. The older you get the more thrills you need to get aroused - surprise me from time to time!  
4. I feel that you need more 'layers' of guitars in your songs. Add something besides the riff, some more low tones or some high repetitive patterns. Something that will diversify the song and make it bloom like a flower.  
5. don't give up and work on your songs - after all it's also (sadly) work. Inventing a riff is cool but turning it into song is hard hard work.  
6. i see a potential so good luck with your sound.  "

"My post-BM band, Súl ad Astral, has released a demo from an upcoming album for streaming; ""This Broken Ideal""","Great song, dude. I, personally, like the vocals. Remind me of Emperor a bit!

Great shit, either way! Keep shredding!"
"My post-BM band, Súl ad Astral, has released a demo from an upcoming album for streaming; ""This Broken Ideal""","Not sure if you guys are looking for feedback, but I thought it was quite good -- you are all obviously talented musicians and know what you are doing. I like the very sudden punky-shoegaze turn 4 minutes in. In the same vein of some of the other posters, the belting vocals feel a bit out of place or too forced. A grittier overall vocal sound rather than oscillating between belting and growling would sound nicer to me personally.

Good luck! c:"

"Heads-up to the fans: The Year of No Light / thisquietarmy split/collab now up for pre-order.","i recorded drums with eric/thisquietarmy for another release/TQA side project and that should get released soon too.  it ended up sounding a lot like year of no light actually.  

TQA is on touring in europe, again, soon!  go see him and say hi! great dude.

i also had no idea this LP was sold out? wow."
"Heads-up to the fans: The Year of No Light / thisquietarmy split/collab now up for pre-order.","That wouldn't be Mains de Givres for which you played the drums, would it? Tremendously good album as well! 
We're going to release that one next year. Probably around summer. Don't worry, I'll give a shout if we're there.

Eric will be staying at our place for a couple of days while he'll be playing in town. He'll also do a radio session when he's here, which I'll gladly post here when it's recorded and stored on soundcloud. 

I'll surely say hi from ""drummer Scottyscotty"". :)

The record is indeed sold out at the label. I'm sure there are still some retail copies circulating, but Destructure is all out at the moment.

what eric and i did was something a little different. it was honestly TQA with driving drums. had a very year of no light build and feel.  (i drum in alaskan, so, my style in that band came through with TQA). i'm not even sure if it has a name or anything. eric and i want to release it at some point, but, it's not a rush. 

tell eric he has ""good riffs"". he hates the word ""riff"" so of course i kept saying it :)"

You made me really curious about the result.

"Amia Venera Landscape ARE BACK! ""Weight Bearer"" (Live in Studio)","From FB :
&gt;almost four years passed since our latest release The Long Procession, and a lot of shit happened in the meanwhile: serious health issues for one of us, unreliable booking agents and other various problems caused a slowdown of the recording sessions. On the other hand, during this period we've chosen and arranged the music for our next four albums, which are already written and are going to be recorded in the next years.

I really wish they'd get less confidential about their daily life/writing/recording, The Long Procession was outstanding and I was beginning to doubt they'd ever consider releasing anything else ! But, hey. FOUR ALBUMS TO COME !

Otherwise the track is everything you could expect from them, which is a good thing in their case."

"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Surprised no-one has mentioned [Deafheaven - *Sunbather*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfbLWHT7vUU) yet. I thought this was a fantastic album and it blew me away. I'm aware that everyone has been jumping on the hype train about this band, and possibly overhyping them in the process, but its still a phenomenal album."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","It's a fantastic album, but the post-black/blackgaze/dsbm (whatever you want to call it) style definitely isn't for everyone.

It would be high up on my list though."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","To be honest, everyone has been harking on about the black metal influence when in places arguably closer to 90s screamo (like [Orchid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpS_1Mx78S8) for example) than anything else."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","The vocal style is very much the same style as old screamo, but the melodies and general song structure are in my opinion a blend of Dsbm ([example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D89pz2hul8)),([another](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hAefXXgR4g))and a bit of shoegaze and even prog-rock to liven it up a bit.

Every review i've read for sunbather gives it a different genre description and i think that is a great thing for an album, it means it is less generic, something different and interesting. It is also acting as a gateway for new people to get into music more like black metal or post metal.

When was the last time a black metal album was this well received by mainstream critics?"
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","The guitar sound itself has more direct lineage to Smiths era Johnny Marr than to shoegaze bands, or at least that aspect of the sound does. However I agree with your observations."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","The blast beats make it black metal."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Great album but I cannot handle the sreamo vocal style as faceman2k mentioned.  The music is outstanding, but that scream irks the shit out of me.  No power behind it.  If they had a better vocalist the album would be on the list no doubt about it.  They need someone like Michael Armine from Rosetta or Loïc Rossetti from The Ocean doing the vocals.  Loïc Rossetti in particular would be a perfect fit as he seamlessly moves between clean and heavy vocals.  That would make for one hell of an album."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","The whole album was written by just the vocalist and the guitarist (the drummer merely played what they asked him to, adding a few tiny bits of personal flair into it, but not much), so getting a different vocalist would have changed the entire sound of the record. 

As for lacking power, I see what you mean to an extent, and I think that was deliberate. I kind of thought that the vocals on this album were kept in the background, whilst the music was in the foreground, as opposed to the other way around which is standard in most music. Its an interesting approach and makes it less aggressive, which I guess fits to the general vibe of the album. Whether its for better or for worse is entirely down to opinion. I dig it personally."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","All solid points there.  I will probably give it another go at some point.  Musically it is outstanding.  Would have been a great instrumental only release."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","The Ocean is my favorite band, so hearing someone talk about Löic in high regards is always awesome to me. That being said, I think Deafheaven's vocals fit the style perfectly. As far as him not having any power, that's definitely in the mixing. He's not out front, and that's hardly new, Tool has been doing that for years. The dude from Deafheaven is actually one of the most powerful frontmen I've ever seen. He screams with such intensity that even when his mouth is two feet away from the microphone it is still resonating over the band. That's just my opinion though. 

The Ocean all day everyday though! Are you gonna hit up their headlining tour in March?"
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Right on with The Ocean.  Brilliant band.  One of the best bands on the planet in any genre.

As for the singer for Deafheaven, it isn't just about the mix, it is the style.  He has a sort of screechy, screamo style that is annoying.  It might just be a preference/tone thing.  I prefer more of a throaty growl.  Jens Kidman, Aaron Turner, Johannes Persson, Löic, etc etc ...nothing screechy with any of those guys.  They are intense and their tone fits the music."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","I feel what you're saying. I'm very picky with my black metal vocals. I hate most highs as I feel they fit your exact description, but I feel Deafheaven's is one of the few I like. You should check out Altar of Plagues' album Mammal. It's a post-metal/black-metal hybrid with a totally different vocal style. I love that album. "

"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Screamo? It's black metal vocals."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","90s screamo is very different to modern day screamo. Effectively separate entities all together. [Orchid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpS_1Mx78S8) are my go to example to explain what I mean. You'll understand what I mean once you get past the 1:40 mark."

"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Solid list. I've heard and agree with the first five and the Pelican album, and I just added the other four to my list of things to listen to. That Sannhet album starts out pretty strong.

"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","post black metal is still post metal. Having stupidly arbitrary genre definitions makes you sound like a pretentious ass.

p.s. read the sidebar"
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","&gt; post black metal is still post metal. 

What? They're completely different genres.

Post-metal is sludge metal + post-rock. Post-black metal is the general term to refer to BM that's mixed with shoegaze, post-rock, and post-punk. Though people do like to use ""blackgaze"" to refer specifically to the shoegaze + BM style.

&gt;Having stupidly arbitrary genre definitions makes you sound like a pretentious ass.

Sorry, just because you don't know how genres are defined, doesn't make them arbitrary."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","In the venn diagram of those genres there is a huge amount of crossover so no they are not completely different. These terms are fluid and don't adhere to the same rigidity as a math equation. You're being pedantic and seriously, read the damn sidebar."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","&gt;In the venn diagram of those genres there is a huge amount of crossover

No, there isn't. One genre is black metal based and the other is sludge metal based.

&gt;These terms are fluid and don't adhere to the same rigidity as a math equation.

Yes, they are fluid, but they still have meaning. You want it to be so fluid as to combine completely different genres. I'm simply pointing out that while ""post-metal"" can be a lot of things it *is not* black metal.

&lt;I&gt;You're being pedantic and seriously, read the damn sidebar.&lt;/i&gt;

You mean the sidebar that specifically mentions post-black metal as another genre?"
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","My favourite album of 2013 is actually one no one has mentioned, and that album is Palms by Palms. This album was really awesome, especially the song ""Shortwave radio"""

"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","I can see why, since it not something that you really expected of the guys from ISIS, and when I first heard ""Future Warriror"", I was far from impressed.

"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Deftones I'd say start at the beginning man. Listen to them all, listen to them grow, almost fall apart around Saturday Night Wrist, then get their shit together and put out the most amazing albums of their careers. Koi No Yokan, their new album is amazing. It's seriously an opus, I love every song on it. I've been listening to them since 1997, and I have to say that I really think they are the best group doing music right now. Crosses, start at the beginning, they are still new enough there isn't as much to wade through. I hope that helps. Take care."

IMO Intronaut has really moved away from sounding anywhere near post-metal. Solid list though. Sannhet is the only one I haven't listened to."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Yes love! [Light Bearer – Silver Tongue](http://lightbearer.bandcamp.com/album/silver-tongue-2) is my definite favorite album of the year, maybe of the century even."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Agree with this. Intronaut's album is spectacular, imo. Going to have to hear the rest a few more times too.

I notice MoTA at number 4. Dawning was certainly a good album. Interestingly though, I haven't listened to it again because I like their old stuff so much more. In fact, The Ties that Blind might be my favorite metal album *ever*. Should I give Dawning another chance?"
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Definitely give Dawning another go.  Brilliant album.  Ties is fantastic no doubt about it, but Dawning just feels like a perfect representation of where they are as a band right now.  Sounds amazing live as well."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Dawning is my favorite album from them. I think adding in the clean vocals to every track really brings their sound to a whole new level as it gives them a new dynamic to work with."

"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Yeah reading about them now.  That guy did everything on the album apparently.  Breach is pretty legendary.  Glad i happened upon this.

The last album that made me nod my head through the whole thing on first listen this much was Howl and Filth by Generation of Vipers.  That's not a 2013 release but I'm reminded of it when listening to this one.  Bit more of an American vibe with them being American.  I guess that makes sense."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","yeah it does. I heard of The Old Wind via The Ocean's facebook page, apparently one of them is a touring member of them. I like how bleak it sounds, it's like his own personal hell. "

"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","That'd be my top 10 list except for that Intronaut album which I never really liked. Prehistoricisms is one of my favorite post metal albums, but this one didn't really appeal to me."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. I don't even think they sound post-metal anymore. It's much closer to alt. rock fused with some generic sludgy sound. People shouldn't like bands just because they put out one good album earlier."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Locrian, anyone? I loved that album."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","That album was really hit or miss for me. It had some great songs but the more repetitive krautrock parts were hard to sit through."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Good list.
But I would consider Inter Arma's ""Sky Burial"" as well."
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","Am I the only one that wasn't that impressed with the new Rosetta? Some combination of the production and songwriting left it feeling very generic for me, like they were just covering ground they'd already done. None of the songs jumped out at me and while I like all their albums, they've always been somewhat of a ""song"" band to me- classics like Ayil, Departe, or Revolve are what keep me coming back. Almost nothing memorable for me on the Anaesthete. Still will catch them live the next time they play though, that's one aspect of the band that will never change for me- their intense live energy

Otherwise, I mostly agree with this list, as well as commenters mentioning the new ones by Light Bearer and Deafheaven- two records that definitely beat out Rosetta or The Ocean for me this year"
"Top 10 Post-Metal/Post-Rock albums of 2013","I felt like the first song was a re-tread but then after that the album has a lot of new stuff. So it just doesn't start off on the best note. I disagree about the song thing. Release/Revolve/Renew work best back to back. The Galilean Satellites seems like a single journey through space.

Three ex members of Isis + Chino seemed like a helluva combination but I was kind of underwhelmed.  The album definitely isn't post-metal.  Not entirely sure you could even classify it as post-rock.

One day I put my music library on shuffle so I could lay in bed and sulk. At some point Wills Devide came on and I FELT IT! I cant really put it into words. I listened to Panopticon on repeat for hours that night. This was 4 years ago and still to this day if im ever depressed ISIS will bring me out of it. "

"Do any of you feel like a band/album saved your life?","For me it was Wake/Lift by Rosetta. Isis and Cult of Luna and Neurosis followed soon after, and in a short time I was neck deep in postmetal.

Red in Tooth and Claw just moves me out of my skin. It pulls my brain out of my head and drags me somewhere that I like, every time."

"New Pelican Album, Forever Becoming, Free Stream!","I've never seen Pelican live, so maybe I'm missing something there, but on their studio stuff, I've never felt like the drummer was out of time.  That being said, I don't really like the drumming in Pelican; the last two albums in particular, I've felt like they've been far to forward in the mix and too simple to justify it.  The first two LPs were perfect: the drums were buried in the mix, kindy fuzzy even, made use of some creative percussion and quiet moments, and had sort of a bludgeoning aspect to them.  They really helped drive the songs.  Lately, they just sort of feel like a distraction from the guitars."

"Battle of the giant, epic endings","One of the best features of the genre: the slow build to enormous, world-crushing climax. Who's done it best? Post specific examples, and when checking out other songs, do them the justice of listening to the whole thing. Yes, it might take twelve minutes, but that's the point. You can't get the same impact by just skipping to the ending. 

Of course the legends have some deserving tracks, but I'll start off with two recent ones (below for separate vote-ability):"
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","[Huldra ""Ursidae""](http://huldratheband.bandcamp.com/track/ursidae)

Little-known but up-and-coming, Huldra sounds *exactly* like Isis, to the point that I had to check multiple times to convince myself Aaron Turner wasn't their vocalist. Looking forward to their next one. "
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","I'm Huldra's guitar by chance and happen to stumble across this. Cheers to you sir. 

The new album is actually finished right now, we're finishing up a final few things, but it will see the light of day soon."
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","Awesome! Looking forward to hearing it!"
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","just listened to this, absolutely love it. i don't hear the isis resemblance, but their timbre and chord progressions sound exactly like early mono before they went soft, which is a sound i've been desperately craving for like a decade. 

thanks!"
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","A minute in and I'm reminded of ""Carry"" by Isis. Still, this is pretty different than what I would expect of Isis. Pretty cool so far."
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","Endings of ""In Fiction,"" ""20 Minutes/40 Years,"" ""Dulcinea,"" and ""So Did We"" (all ISIS)."
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","It's hard to list the best ending on an Isis song since they have to many epic moments but for me Grining Mouths has the biggest ending ever. Closes perfectly one of the best albums I've ever heard.

Also Je N'en Connais Pas La fin from Rosetta has avery powerful one."
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","So agreed about the ending of Grinning Mouths. Also I feel like Grinning Mouths as a full song does for Panopticon as a full album what the discussed endings do for these individual songs"
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","I like Hym more. It's such a positive ending too which really does it for me."
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","That ending is unreal."

"Battle of the giant, epic endings","Especially the live version of So Did We from [Bonnaroo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT25yJnIJ8M)!"
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","[Crib45 ""Marching Through the Borderlines""](http://crib45.bandcamp.com/track/borderlines) 

Tremendously underrated band, no idea why. Carrying the torch of late-'00s post-metal beautifully. "

"Battle of the giant, epic endings","I mean, I don't know about in an all-time post-metal throwdown. But one of my favorites in the entire genre has got to be [Woundwort by Fall of Efrafa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA3VwvMOvrM). The song starts off normally enough for sludge, some big ol' riffs, but then the beginning of what eventually becomes the build-up comes around 8:09. The guitars drop away, and we're just left with a little bit of feedback, a simple drumbeat and a steady bassline. The next few minutes, it swells and swells until 11:34 hits and it feels simply transcendental"
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","Had never heard this song (or band!) before. Holy shit, so good. "
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","For me the most crushing ending is rosetta's [clavius] (http://youtu.be/hNXjjIhnHKQ) with an honorable mention to fall of efrafa's the warren of snares"
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","[Rosetta - TMA3](http://rosetta.bandcamp.com/track/tma-3)

My personal favourite song by them. Explosive climax with tons of huge riffs."
"Battle of the giant, epic endings","Somehow I don't even think I've heard this one. For my money, climaxes don't get much better than [""Au Pays Natal""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meRrx4jgZzY), the closer from the greatest post-metal album ever made. "

"A challenge!","I propose a challenge to the readers of this subreddit: at some point over the next week, take a half hour to go out and discover a new post metal band.  They don't have to be amazing, or even ""new""; just new to *you*.  Then, of course, come back here and post them!

Let's face it, this is a pretty obscure genre (as evidenced by this subreddit having only 605 subscribers!).  But there ARE a lot of bands out there, if you're willing to dig a little.  For me, I've found the best way to discover a new band is to go to youtube, look up a video from a band I like, then start checking out the related videos.  I've had a lot of success this way - I don't always find the most amazing bands, but at least it's something new!

I'll get this started.  I was doing some digging this morning and came across some pretty interesting sludge-y post metal in [Destroy Judas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKhZoD2qA7Q).  If you like it, their [bandcamp page](http://destroyjudas.bandcamp.com/) has the album available for download at name your own price."

"Father Rust - Redwood &amp; Abandon Illusion","Hey guys, my band Father Rust has released a couple of tracks from our forthcoming EP, ""Vol. 1: Elders."" Redwood is an instrumental track and leads our live set, while Abandon Illusion does include vocals (all 4 of us do vocals). Our drummer recorded us out of his home, and we'd love some feedback! CHEERS!

"Father Rust - Redwood &amp; Abandon Illusion","Submissions like these are honestly why I come to this sub; this has all the right post-metal staples in all the right places, and seriously love the Crib45-everyone's-a-vocalist and The Ocean influences specifically in the second song (that opening marching riff absolutely rips). Definitely will be following you guys and any further material, but I was wondering what specific recording/production techniques you guys used, since compared to many records but especially as a DIY it sounds extremely well done. "
"Father Rust - Redwood &amp; Abandon Illusion","You seriously just made my day. Thanks a ton for the feedback! I'm gonna forward this along to our drummer who does our recording in his home. If you want to shoot me a DM with your email address, I'll send you our track that we are releasing last from the EP. It comes in at about 14 minutes. 

Seriously, Thanks again, and I'll post what my drummer says here, as a reply."
"Father Rust - Redwood &amp; Abandon Illusion","Yea dude thank you so much it means alot. We'll definitely send you the other song we have. Also we should have probably another ep's worth of stuff before the end of the year. Hoping to really expand more into the stuff we kind of did on these songs."

"The Ocean ""Statherian""",""
"The Ocean ""Statherian""","The Ocean Collective peaked early with this album. I love their energy in live shows, but none of their new material compares well to Precambrian."
"The Ocean ""Statherian""","I disagree. I thought Heliocentric was the best thing they've done. Anthropocentric was also really good. The latest is a lot less memorable.

This album in particular just doesn't seem like they're fleshing out the ideas as well as they do on later albums."
"The Ocean ""Statherian""","Firmament is the only song that I can stand from Heliocentric. I think Anthropocentric is great. Aeolian is a close third. Disc 2 of Precambrian can't be beat."
"The Ocean ""Statherian""","Why can't you stand most of Heliocentric? I think it's their most tightly executed, coherent, and best-paced album."
"The Ocean ""Statherian""","Heliocentric had just come out when I started listening to them. The city in the sea from Aeolian was my my introduction to the band. Precambrian was next. Heliocentric just didn't pack the same kind of punch."
"The Ocean ""Statherian""","&gt;Heliocentric just didn't pack the same kind of punch.

That's correct. It packs a completely different kind of punch. One that's a lot more effective than anything else they've done. The rest of their work just isn't as well put-together. Anthropocentric just sounds like a bunch of extra songs rather than an album."
"The Ocean ""Statherian""","Quite the opposite here. I accidentally bought Heliocentric (just cause it looked neat and was tagged post-metal) and was stunned both by the album design and sound. When later I checked their other works, for some reason they did not left as much impact on me."

"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete",""
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","You don't need to post crappy Youtube links as this is on Bandcamp:

http://theanaesthete.bandcamp.com/track/oku-the-secrets

People can listen to the whole album, you don't have to worry about poor quality and transcodes, and you can buy it in a number of formats. Always check Bandcamp first. A video site should not be used for music."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","WHY IS THIS ALBUM SO GOOD"
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","Word.  New album is fucking brilliant.  Better than Wake/Lift and Determinism and equally as good if not better than The Galilean Satellites imo"
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","You think TGS is their best? Hmm... I'm not so sure about that. It seemed like they were still finding their sound at the time and it's really inconsistent. I'm torn between ADOM and Wake/Lift as their best (not counting this yet) as ADOM is more consistent (and less repetitive) but Wake/Lift has more ""high"" moments. "
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","Completely agreed. Wake is a fucking masterpiece and (in my opinion) *the* quintessential Rosetta song. But then right after it, you have Temet Nosce... ADOM, on the other hand, has absolutely zero dull moments, unless you count Blue Day for Croatoa."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","I like Blue Day for Croatoa as an instrumental, pace setting track for the album. Especially now that I know what the song title means."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","You do? Is it about the Roanoke Colony? Because otherwise it flew way over my head."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","It's from the comic *100 Bullets.* I just looked it up and yes, what the comic is referencing is about Roanoke Colony. I guess I don't know my history because I wasn't sure if the comic was referencing something real or not until now.

Either way, Blue Day for Croatoa is a song that's somewhat important to the plot of the comic, and I'm more than certain enough that Armine would be enough of a geek to make that reference."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","Oh, cool, thanks. I've always wondered what that was about."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","TGS is definitely my favorite by them and it ain't even close.  I don't really see the inconsistency (although that first heavy part in Itinerant does strike me as slightly out of place), and the last track is easily my favorite by them.

I should probably give this new album some more listens, but I've come away pretty unimpressed.  Nothing reached out and grabbed me like in previous albums."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","At this point it is a toss up between the new album and TGS for best album.  One of the common factors being the vocals are a bit more out in front in the mix.  Wake/Lift and ADOM are great albums but I always felt the vocals are too buried.  The new album is exceptional in my opinion.  Bass and drumming in particular.  The only complaint I have is with Hodoku / Compassion.  The clean vocals don't work and the song feels out of place."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","Yeah agreed. The clean vocals worked on ADOM but they need to be used right. Light Bearer did clean vocals 2 albums in a row and it was much more powerful when they were used the first time around as they limited it to just that use. Either way I overall enjoy this trend. I think the latest MOTA is my favorite album by them and it's largely because of the clean vocals."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","Yeah the new MOTA album is fantastic.  Man this has been a great year for music.  New Intronaut, Ocean, MOTA, Rosetta, etc.  "
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","I haven't listened to the new Intronaut since I'm still bummed I missed them when I got really drunk to try and get over how bad Scale the Summit was when I saw MOTA, StS, and Introanut. I guess it's time to get over it."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","That sucks dude.  I completely agree with you about STS.  Talented band but kinda boring live.  MOTA was outstanding and Intronaut were as good as any band I have ever seen live.  I have seen many good bands in my life and Intronaut is right up there.  I have seen them twice now.  Really bummed I am going to miss them with Cult of Luna.  Can't believe I forgot to mention Vertikal on that list.  Like I said great year for good music."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","STS is all skill and no talent IMO. They can barely write a song but they can certainly play."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","I like their new album but their live performance just didn't do much for me.  Technical instrumental metal walks a delicate line between creativity and jerkin it for the sake of jerkin it.  Animals as Leaders is a band that get's it right imo.  They are fantastic live."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","The album music is as good as the album cover is bad. Really."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","The album cover is much worse, I would say."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","So the album cover is worse than the music is good? I can agree. Good but not breathtaking music, AWFUL art."
"Rosetta - Oku / The Secrets - off their new album The Anaesthete","Exactly. I mean, Rosetta's music is always great, but this is definitely not their best.

And christ that cover is awful."

"Let's try to get an AMA...","I know this is a small sub-reddit still, but, if we can get up to 1000 people, we should try to get an AMA. I know it's a long shot, but it's worth it.

If we were to do an AMA, who should we get? I would say Aaron Turner. Because you know...he's a god? That is all. I'm open to suggestions!"
"Let's try to get an AMA...","Aaron Turner is cool but I think Aaron Harris would be more likely to do one, he seemed really down to earth and he is on twitter and responds to fans."

"Let's try to get an AMA...","I think either Turner or Harris, or maybe even someone like Danny Carey (he seems like the only member of Tool who might be willing to do something like this).  But I don't think we should just limit ourselves to /r/postmetal.  Any name like Turner and Harris would do really well in /r/metal, meatheads aside."
"Let's try to get an AMA...","I think this is the best idea - especially if we're talking about guys from Isis, since so many people that are just into metal and not post metal actually dig Isis.

Turner would be my first choice."
"Let's try to get an AMA...","I'm down for trying to get a bigger guy like Turner into /r/metal. That is not a bad idea at all, guys. I'll try to get in contact with the guys over at /r/metal, and see what we can do."
"Let's try to get an AMA...","A group AMA with Aaron Harris, Chino Moreno, Jeff Caxide and Clifford Meyer would be good. Probably wouldn't be too hard to get them all in the same thread since they're working on an album at the moment, right?"

"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","I liked it and they got the mix right this time. The vocals are better in the back and the drums more in the front. The mix is still very busy and the longer song kind of drags on."
"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","That album cover and new font are horrid. At least the music was great."
"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","It's a very weird choice of cover artists. I remember from his portfolio, the artist has designed releases by Anberlin, Thrice, and Underoath. Not sure how they go from working with Aaron Turner for the debut to an artists that has seemingly no connection to their music.

Anyway, tracks still sound like them (great), so I'm very excited to see Rosetta tomorrow."
"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","Yep. Totally agree. Much prefer their older album covers."
"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","Wasn't all of their art done by the singer before? Or was that just someone from Translation Loss?"
"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","Well, the art of Galilean Satellites was done by none other than [Aaron Turner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Turner), but their catalogue from then on I think is all Armine. Maybe not the splits they have done, but A Determinism of a Morality and Wake/Lift AFAIK are all Armine."
"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","I don't remember the artist for the cover of Wake/Lift, but the artist for ADOM and the Junius/Rosetta split is [Mike Wohlberg](http://www.thefatkidillustration.com/)"
"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","How does the Galilean Satellites look on vinyl? The regular album art isn't that impressive..."

"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","TGS is just a black vinyl, nothing really fancy to it"
"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","TGS came out in two pieces on vinyl - a double LP that were the regular tracks, and a second double LP that was the ambient overlays.  They had different cover art (the 2nd, ambient album, was blue).  Part 1 was released on black but also clear vinyl.  Part 2 was pressed to yellow vinyl.  (I have the black of part 1 and the yellow part 2).  More info [here](http://www.discogs.com/Rosetta-The-Galilean-Satellites/master/458356)."
"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","You're right, I completely forgot about them. I still need to get part 2"
"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","I have part 1; it's on translucent blue vinyl. It looks nice, but it's a bit flimsy."

This guy mentions that the ambient album has alternate cover art. Which is what I was wondering. If there was anything cool to play off the quadraphonic nature of the album."
"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","It reminds me of some of Celeste's album covers...but worse. The music is great though. I like the production on these 2 songs better than the last album already, though it sounded way better on vinyl."
"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","Celeste never had any photoshopped flames. Also the cover for Morte(s) Nee(s) is fucking amazing. It's probably the best photo the photographer has done: http://indiae.deviantart.com/art/le-moribond-114518328"
"Two new Rosetta tracks streaming now! New album ""The Anaesthete"" coming this Thursday.","I was mostly talking about the face, but I like the Celeste cover - not the Rosetta one."

"Listened to Pelican for the first time. This stuff is awesome! What are some fundamental postmetal bands/albums that I should seek out to really get into this genre.","It's all in the title. I would really appreciate some direction. Thanks, friends! (p.s. I prefer instrumental stuff.)

edit: that should be a question mark at the end of the title.

second edit: also, I didn't originally notice that ""Intro to Post Metal"" in the sidebar, so thanks for dealing with me haha.

third edit: the type of stuff I'm most interested in is like Pelican's ""What We All Come To Need"" (album and the song itself). I haven't started on your guys's quite generous suggestions yet but I can tell from the comments that there is a lot more distinction within the postmetal subgenre than I realized. So I might be into what some of you have referred to as the ""heavier postrock""."

"Listened to Pelican for the first time. This stuff is awesome! What are some fundamental postmetal bands/albums that I should seek out to really get into this genre.","Keep exploring Pelican, for one. I've never listened to any other band more than I have them. Note though that they are closer to post-rock than post-metal. Then, maybe give [Russian Circles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMHkYijJW3M) a try, maybe some [Red Sparowes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZizMmubcF54) too. 

EDIT: Seems I'm the only one that read your post. These are all instrumental bands."
"Listened to Pelican for the first time. This stuff is awesome! What are some fundamental postmetal bands/albums that I should seek out to really get into this genre.","Other than the big three (Neurosis, Isis, and Cult of Luna), the second tier is Rosetta and Callisto. Then, if you want to keep going, there's Burst (more progressive), Crib45 (sounds like CoL/Callisto, their newest is *excellent*), Huldra (sounds like later Isis), Intronaut (prog/jazzy), Irreversible, North, Sarin (sounds like earlier Isis), and Year of No Light. 

All of these have vocals, I don't like instrumental post-metal, and am honestly not a big fan of the Pelican/Russian Circles strand either. I just think of them as slightly heavier post-rock. "
"Listened to Pelican for the first time. This stuff is awesome! What are some fundamental postmetal bands/albums that I should seek out to really get into this genre.","Isis - Oceanic and Through Silver in Blood, Times of Grace and Eye of Every Storm by Neurosis. "

"Been waitin too long to see this!",""
"Been waitin too long to see this!","I love post metal intensely, but never got Pelican. I feel like (and I know how this is gonna sound) their songwriting and musicianship took a huge dive after Australasia.  But I'd love to hear notions to the contrary or tracks that would change my mind. Either way, psyched for op."
"Been waitin too long to see this!","Personally I'm a huge fan. Their songwriting technique has always been some of my favorite since I found them, but that's just me personally.

Talked with them a bit at the merch table and it sounds like their most popular album is ""The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw"". I myself am a big fan of the album ""City of Echoes"" as well as ""What We All Come to Need"". Off of the latter I particularly like, [""Final Breath""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0IVG8a3TN4&amp;list=PLmWRjKN7X_vno6kfYKDQW8bZItuqU0hC9&amp;index=6) which is a bit of a departure from their normal style being that it's a bit more laid back and includes some vocals.

Either way, like them or not, they are great musicians and absolutely floored their live set tonight. Super tight and very high energy which drew the crowd in."
"Been waitin too long to see this!","I agree but will say they went downhill after A Fire in Our Throats.  It seemed like the logical next step after Australasia with their songs being a bit less drone-y and more focused.  Then they said ""People don't seem to enjoy listening to these songs live"" and shifted to whatever it is you'd call what they're doing now (boring is my preferred word).

I really miss the old Pelican.  I get that they want to write songs that people can get into during a concert, but I don't see why that has to prevent them from writing a couple of those slower, more post-metaly songs like Nightendday per album."
"Been waitin too long to see this!","Definitely agree though I thought Forever Becoming was a lot better than other recent efforts. Ataraxia/Taraxis is when they started turning it back around."
"Been waitin too long to see this!","Just walked in and ready to see this this amazing band play. Pelican has been one of my absolute favorites for a couple years and were the first band to get me into the genre. 

I'll make sure to take plenty of pictures and get back on how fantastic they are.

Edit: WOW. Blown away by the set tonight. They are fantastic live. I have no idea when my ears will stop ringing but the tinnitus is well worth it. Played a good mix of old and new stuff and gave an encore as well. Absolutely cannot wait to see these guys again some day.

[Here's an album of some of the pictures I took.](http://imgur.com/a/rgBjL). Had to use my phone because I didn't have access to a nicer camera tonight. Did a bit of editing to soften up the shitty quality so sorry for the instagramish look. Picked up some merch for $40 bucks after the show. Really happy to help these guys out and get to see them live. It was incredible."
"Been waitin too long to see this!","Wear earplugs to shows dude."
"Been waitin too long to see this!","Hah! Yea I had meant to. I was scrambling to find them before the show and couldn't."
"Been waitin too long to see this!","&gt;  I have no idea when my ears will stop ringing but the tinnitus is well worth it.

I know this was a joke but I want to reinforce that tinnitus is definitely NOT worth it.  The feeling you get when it's been there for about a week and hasn't even started to go away and you realize it's there for life and a moment's silence will never be the same again is absolutely awful."
"Been waitin too long to see this!","This is actually why I bought plugs the day after the show. Hopefully I won't run into that issue."
"Been waitin too long to see this!","I'm so jealous. Have fun!"
"Been waitin too long to see this!","Definitely had fun. It was absolutely amazing. They totally floored me with their sound and they are super tight live."
"Been waitin too long to see this!","Top 40 R&amp;B is my favorite band!"

"Any suggestions for good instrumental post-metal/heavy post-rock?","Russian Circles, Pelican, Stallone "
"Any suggestions for good instrumental post-metal/heavy post-rock?","The sidebar had some great recommendations.  Some members of Bossk started a band called the Mire IIRC.  They have a great EP available.   Also Monkey3 is worth your time. Instrumental, heavy and melodic. Not too droney. 

Jakob is another band you should listen to.  They're more on the post - rock side of things, very atmospheric metal sound.   Highly recommended. They've got a lot of albums but don't be afraid to start with any of them. 

Also if you can find it, Hippie Killer by Bongripper is great.   Its more stoner rock, no vocals and very repetitive of you're into that style. "
"Any suggestions for good instrumental post-metal/heavy post-rock?","Is The Mire any good? What do they sound like? "
"Any suggestions for good instrumental post-metal/heavy post-rock?","It's been a while since I listened but i would say it sounded like the vocalist is the same from Bossk.  It reminded more of the second EP though not as slow nor bass-heavy.   It was just a couple of songs which I liked alright, but mostly recommended because of the Bossk connection.   "
"Any suggestions for good instrumental post-metal/heavy post-rock?","Hippie Killer is one of my favorite albums so yeah definitely into that, and I'll have to check out Jakob and Mire, thanks man!"
"Any suggestions for good instrumental post-metal/heavy post-rock?","Sure! Hope you like them.   Speaking of Bossk I think i read on this sub they were getting back together.  Heard anything new from them yet? "

"TIDINGS - Proteus ","Yes, hopefully it is available...

Out of pure curiosity, I'm relatively new to this genre. Any recommendations on where to begin? (other than ISIS and Cult of Luna)"
"TIDINGS - Proteus ","Some of my personal favorites are Rosetta - ""A Determinism of Morality,"" Light Bearer - ""Lapsus"", Fall of Efrafa - ""Inle"", Amenra  - ""Mass iiii""...those albums should be a good start and get you well on your way to discovering over related acts and albums.  "
"TIDINGS - Proteus ","On the sidebar there's a link to a ""Intro to Post Metal"" thread we did a few months back, it lists a lot of bands.  Some of my personal favorites include those you mentioned, Neurosis, Mouth of the Architect, Pelican (their album The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw is one of my favorites), Consciousness Removal Project...there are also a lot of lesser known bands I discover an album from and fall in love with, like Destroy Judas.  This place has been great for finding new post metal, so check back often.  I also discover a lot of bands by looking up a song I like on youtube, then checking out the related videos."
"TIDINGS - Proteus ","Yeah this subreddit is a goldmine for new bands.

Any specific Neurosis songs? I've heard a ton about then, just never anything specific enough to get into them."
"TIDINGS - Proteus ","Depends on what you like, they've evolved a lot over their careers.  They used to be a hardcore band before developing the post metal sound.  The song that really got me into them was Stones From the Sky.  Favorite album by them would be The Eye of Every Storm."
"TIDINGS - Proteus ","Yep, on their FB they said it'd be on Bandcamp today."

"Hydra Head Records is no longer. Goodnight, sweet prince. ","Since Isis broke up I've been expecting this day to come. Honestly though, I think the bands that were on Hydra Head will be able to do better through services like Bandcamp. They won't have to press albums anymore (I mostly mean CDs)! I think there are services that will press vinyl of digital albums though, so vinyl collectors will still be able to get their goods."
"Hydra Head Records is no longer. Goodnight, sweet prince. ","This is sad news, but it's probably actually more amazing they made it this far. I feel bad for the bands, but I'm sure the really good ones will land on their feet. You don't get rich on this kind of music, but there's enough vinyl-collecting beardos out there to get by. "
"Hydra Head Records is no longer. Goodnight, sweet prince. ","It's not hard to put out vinyl DIY, I've seen quite a few bands do it. Just goes to show very few labels are safe in the current state of the music industry. I agree, most of these bands will do alright and will most likely pick up on other labels, or just keep it real on their own. Hydra Head's end is most certainly the end of an era though. "
"Hydra Head Records is no longer. Goodnight, sweet prince. ","The bands will do fine. Sure. But who is going to pay for their studio time and mastering?"
"Hydra Head Records is no longer. Goodnight, sweet prince. ","The bands will, like they always have. They would have had to let money go to Hydra Head for that in the first place. They bands may even have their own recording equipment (not unrealistic, I own enough recording equipment that I could make an album and I'm not in a band currently)."
"Hydra Head Records is no longer. Goodnight, sweet prince. ","i think one of the sadder things they stated is that one of the reasons for their ""demise"" is the music indistry nowadays. i can only assume ""music industry"" refers to the top record companies and the terrible music they are into producing and releasing right now. not to mention how they like to ""run"" things.


as someone who runs a record label in canada, watching shipping costs rise and watching this stronghold the ""music industry"" has on everything work more and more in their favour has made me debate whether or not i want to continue to support bands and people i love...or deal with the horribly stupid people who are allowed this much power. i can deal with a lot of things, but, money hungry assholes are not one of them.


sorry HH. take care (and reprint some daughters shirts PLEASE. mine is looking more like a rag versus a shirt).

dwyer records."
"Hydra Head Records is no longer. Goodnight, sweet prince. ","I think ""industry"" refers to ""labels who want to make money"" rather than ""labels who just want to release things."" Even independent labels have to face the same sort of economics. People are just plain buying less music. Artists are doing okay. They can still tour and make a bit of cash (at least to support their touring efforts.) However, with people buying less music, these labels are finding less to survive off of. Which is unfortunate because obviously not every label that's paying to put bands in the studio and get their work mastered, printed, and released, is not evil."

"Looking for albums similar to 'Panopticon' and 'Oceanic'","Jakob.  "
"Looking for albums similar to 'Panopticon' and 'Oceanic'","Whenever I listen to Isis I always hear a pretty clear Neurosis influence.  I'd recommend some slightly older albums by them, namely 'Enemy of the Sun', 'Through Silver and Blood', and 'Times of Grace'. "
"Looking for albums similar to 'Panopticon' and 'Oceanic'","I've always struggled with Neurosis and I just find them plain brutal and abrasive without much else to say about them. Am I wrong?"
"Looking for albums similar to 'Panopticon' and 'Oceanic'","Yes!  Each Neurosis album is quite different, especially their mid to late era stuff.  If you want to start with something less abrasive The Eye of Every Storm would work."
"Looking for albums similar to 'Panopticon' and 'Oceanic'","Agreed. This is a great album and far more forgiving than much of their other work. I'd say its easier to listen to than some of the earlier Isis albums. "
"Looking for albums similar to 'Panopticon' and 'Oceanic'","You're not wrong; it took me a long time to warm up to Neurosis. They experiment a ton and never settle into a single, solid post-metal sound like most of the bands they influenced. Their newer stuff, though, especially ""Given to the Rising"", is as pure post-metal as you'll find in their catalogue."
"Looking for albums similar to 'Panopticon' and 'Oceanic'","You're extremely wrong but this guy also isn't right in recommending them when you're used to Isis."

"Looking for albums similar to 'Panopticon' and 'Oceanic'","TBH Galilean Satellites is the only Rosetta album I really like.  The others are okay but they don't have the magic of their first album.  I know a lot of people are big fans of Wake/Lift, but the awful vocal mix ruins that album for me.  Might be worth giving it a shot though."
"Looking for albums similar to 'Panopticon' and 'Oceanic'","If you like Rosetta,  check out VYGR. I can't link because I'm on mobile. Everything they've done is great. Spacy, doomy, sludgy from Boston, I believe. 

They only have a couple songs on YouTube but I hope you like what you hear enough to buy their stuff."
"Looking for albums similar to 'Panopticon' and 'Oceanic'","Nope, Galilean Satellites is their best. Be sure to hear the ""mixed"" version; the album was released as a heavy disc and an ambient disc meant to be played together. "

"Subsume | Cloudkicker","I think Subsume is my favorite Cloudkicker album. I actually didn't even like it when I first heard it. It really took quite a few listens to grow on me, but I'm glad I stuck with it. Subsume has the emotion of Let Yourself Be Huge, with the heaviness of Beacons, and then a nice mix post metal/post rock/post whatever. ""He would be riding on the subway..."" begins with the same riff looped over and over again, each time building a new lay of subtle guitar. It repeats for over four minutes before finally crescendoing, but then the song builds up again, and hits you in the face. Man, I really love that song, and that album"

"Rosetta - Soot (from the upcoming Flies to Flame EP)","Some info about the EP that they [posted](http://rosettaband.tumblr.com/post/83720147323/new-ep-update) a few months back:

&gt; Our new EP, titled Flies to Flame, is being mastered this week. It’ll be out later this year in traditional formats — LP and CD — on Translation Loss Records. This not a pay-what-you-wish digital release.
&gt; 
&gt; This recording was a departure from our normal working style. We wrote the material in late 2012 and recorded it in a garage in early 2013, while we were writing The Anaesthete. It’s deliberately lo-fi, jangly, and experimental, a tribute to the stripped-down sound of the post-rock and drone records we loved when Rosetta began. Most of it was improvised as it was being recorded, and it was not edited or ‘fixed’ to make it sound polished. All the grit is there. We used different instruments and equipment than we normally play with, since this material isn’t intended to be played live. Instead it functions as a kind of process document, from an important and transitional year in our life as a band.
&gt; 
&gt; For the first time since The Galilean Satellites, we did all recording and mixing ourselves (with the invaluable help of our intern engineer, Alex Ruday). Mike Wohlberg is returning to create the artwork and layout, and James Plotkin is mastering it for both CD and vinyl.
&gt; 
&gt; Track list:
&gt; 1. Soot
&gt; 2. Seven Years with Nothing to Show
&gt; 3. Les Mots et les Choses
&gt; 4. Pegasus"

"New Rosetta EP teasers","Clip 2: http://rosettaband.com/post/42000239293/new-ep-sessions-teaser-clip-2-just-guitar

Explanation of new material: http://rosettaband.com/post/42020900579/new-material"
"New Rosetta EP teasers","&gt;Instead of a 4-song showcase of newer sounds, this is a big single-song experiment — a studio piece where we get to make sounds that we wouldn’t get to make otherwise, with no intention of it ever being performed live. It’s just a big empty canvas, motivated by the question of what is possible from a compositional standpoint, rather than a performance standpoint. We can’t play like a 10-piece band, but we can write like one. It’s also fun to use many more different instruments than we could ever possibly bring on tour.

"A rehearsal video of my band Titanis. Post-Metal from Massachusetts. Our first show is coming up soon. Thoughts? ","The track overall is pretty nice.
From a compositional perspective, your transition into the heavy part should probably be accompanied by bass and drums hits with that first heavy chord shot.  That's just my opinion though.  Carry the torch.  The more post-metal the merrier."
"A rehearsal video of my band Titanis. Post-Metal from Massachusetts. Our first show is coming up soon. Thoughts? ","Thanks for the feedback. Do you mean the first heavy chord, at 5:52 of the video when the guitarist switches channels from clean? If so, I think he just does it a bit early there but once recorded it's going to stay clean until he starts his solo. Right before that, I do the tremolo picking on G as a lead into the heavy part, and the drummer comes in with it,(like in the video) then we all go into the heavy part in unison while he starts the solo. "

"Rosetta - Hara / The Center (Metalsucks exclusive premiere)","Just so you know, the vinyl will only be released in Europe and Australia until Rosetta can fund a pressing here in the US. So if you're in the US you'll have to dish out a bit more cash to get the vinyl.

"Intronaut- Core Relations",""
"Intronaut- Core Relations","I think the thing I admire most about Intronaut is how true to their particular sound they remain. I'm glad they're not just an ISIS rip off (even though I adore ISIS) and continue to explore avenues of their own style. The harmonic vocals in this song have a habit of giving me goosebumps. 
But I think to truly understand just how far they have come in evolution one would have to listen to ""Fragments of Character"". A layered and complex song such as that is quite the contrast to a wavy but solid composition such as this song. The fret-less bass is just so good. "
"Intronaut- Core Relations","I totally have to agree. I really feel like they had set a precedent with Prehistoricism. Never before had I heard a band so fluidly blend stunning beauty with such raw aggression. The video for [Australopithecus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZYhDtg31Wc) (I felt) perfectly captured that emotion, too. And then Valley of Smoke. What an amazingly defining album. They held true to every aspect of creativity they'd developed even as far back as Void, but *still* brought so many new super creative ideas to the table. I should stop, I sound a little too fan boy."
"Intronaut- Core Relations","I think we can all just agree that Intronaut is fucking awesome."
"Intronaut- Core Relations","Awesome before even mentioning left-handed, 5-string, fretless bass. I've not seen a lot of fretless action in this area of music…except for maybe Oxbow."

"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","Hello beards and girls

Me and a friend have been jamming out some stuff recently. We've got a guy roped in to sing. The story of a fishing village is taking shape. The rest of the line up is a work in progress as we speak (who knows - maybe i'll throw out a post on that topic later? Keep your eyes open redditors in the UK)

But to cut the chase - how do you go about writing songs? Some people come up with riffs in the shower. Others jam for hours. Whats your writing process? And how do you record/note down those sounds you come up with? 

We're most of the way through our first song, but i just want to expand my thinking to avoid hitting any writing block"
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","I think this is a really cool post.  As someone who plays guitar but doesn't have a creative bone in his body, I'm always intrigued by peoples' creative processes."
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","Second. The best I can do is solo along in my way -__-.

Still love it haha."
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","in my band, Alaskan, our guitarist comes up with a rough idea for a song (or sometimes an entire song), shows it to me (the drummer) and we work out the kinks.  he normally will have parts to the song, a rough idea of the order he wants them in and how he wants each part to ""feel"". we work together on the transitions, timing, tempos etc. typically, before i even get a chance to work with the song in front of my drums, i'm sent a rough bedroom recording of the guitar parts and i listen/air drum to those for as long as i need to (typically a few days). if i can't come up with anything, we go jam to see if actually watching him play makes a difference. it usually helps quite a bit.



once he and i are happy and finished with what we've come up with, we show our bassist and help him to learn the song.  we also give him his time with the song to add his own flare to it. eventually we play it live a few times to see how it feels and if it's good, we keep it. vocals are added along the way (our guitarist writes the vocals as well).



i'm in a few other non-post metal bands and the writing process is quite similiar. i'm not a fan of ""just jamming"" and hoping something comes of it. i've never really had much luck with that."
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","My band has a similar process. Usually one of us will come up with 2 or 3 riffs/parts that sound good together, and then will make scratch recordings of it. From there it will be uploaded to an online dropbox that we can all access. 

From there the 3 of us will individually take the parts, and rearrange them, add to it, take stuff out as we would see it. We all upload our revised versions and then listen through at the next practice deciding what we like/don't like. Then we'll take to actually learning what we have so far as a band, and make adjustments as we play through it about 20 times in a row. 

I guess it's a little complicated but we don't get much time to practice so the more we can do outside of it, the better. "
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","man, i love the internet for reasons like the above. writing and recording is so damn easy."
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","Really helps being that everyone in my band works full time jobs. When it really comes down to it though, I think we can all agree that it usually starts with a riff. "
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","i agree for sure.

us 3 all work full time jobs, run a record label and are in several other bands too (i'm in 5, our guitarist is in 7 and our bassist is in 3). we're busy.  cripes."
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","Just wanted to say that you guys kick ass, keep up the good work!"
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","thank you very much!! nice of you to take the time to tell me this."
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","[deleted]"
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","thank you too!!"
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","start by guitar. start by picking some random unworkable idea (two notes in a bad rhythm or unpleasant noise) and then try and make it work as a riff. record it and about 15 variations. arrange them into something. 

show up at practice, play it for people, see what they do with it. go from there."
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","In my band we mostly jam on stuff.  One of us may start with a riff that we had come up with on our own with the rest of us joining in.  We usually record the jam which we then listen through and cut out the good parts or actually cut together a rough structure of a song.  This is then jammed upon again with another round of recording and cutting.  Some of the greatest stuff is done by accident so we always try and record the jams."
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","I am a vocalist in a post-metal band, and usually one of our guitar players comes up with a riff, and then they kinda weave everything around it, make it grow organically, although there are no written rules to it really"
"People in post metal bands: Your writing process","i'm not in a band but i'd be interested in how you drummers out there develop interesting and creative drum parts. i'm playing the drums for about 2 years now; i've been playing together with a few friends and i improvise to random songs on my ipod, BUT: after a while i find myself playing the same patterns over and over again. i'm trying to get as much creative input as possible, but when i'm out of ideas, it's always one of approximately five patterns that comes to my mind... how do you guys avoid this? and how long did it take you to find your personal note, your very own way of drumming?

TL;DR: i'm a drummer with a lack of creativity. help me!"

"Did anyone realize Pelican released a new EP this month?","I like this song somewhat but the rest is kinda meh.  I'm probably going to be the only person here to say this, but I don't really like Pelican anymore.  Their first two full lengths were great (especially The Fire in Our Throats...one of my favorite albums ever), but everything they've done since has felt lazy and boring.  I've been hoping they'd go back to that style but it looks like they've abandoned it for good."
"Did anyone realize Pelican released a new EP this month?","they have gotten soft imo. nothing compared to the older stuff"

"Did anyone realize Pelican released a new EP this month?","When I saw them with Isis a couple years back, they seemed to play only material from City of Echoes/What We All Come to Need.  I was extremely disappointed.  Have they gone back to playing older material lately?"
"Did anyone realize Pelican released a new EP this month?","No idea. I saw them shortly after city of echoes was released and they played mostly older stuff, great show. If they're not performing some of their original stuff now then I'm pretty disappointed"
"Did anyone realize Pelican released a new EP this month?","Not really, when I saw them it was mostly WWACTN and a couple off The Fire and City of Echoes, But I'm really a huge fan of WWACTN, and just purely based on the huge sound they have I think it's not really possible to not enjoy it, they are legitimately heaviest band I have ever seen.

I would have loved to see then support Isis, I'm really fucking bummed that they split up before I really got into them."
"Did anyone realize Pelican released a new EP this month?","Someone in the post-rock sub-reddit did.

The EPs alright."
"Did anyone realize Pelican released a new EP this month?","This sounds pretty good for Pelican.

"Giant Squid - Tongue Stones (Megaptera megachasmacarcharias)","Really? I thought cenotes was better than Ichyologist because the songs had more depth where as Ichyologist came off as a little too pop-py (specifically in the drumming) in some parts (just couldn't shake how much that bass riff in throwing a donner party at sea sounded like greenday). "
"Giant Squid - Tongue Stones (Megaptera megachasmacarcharias)","Hmmm interesting. I really liked the bass, but I haven't heard much Green Day (if any) so I can't really offer an opinion there. Again what I said above was all opinion, but I feel as though The Icthyologist was a stronger album... Maybe that's because it was longer! Either way, it's all really good to me.

I'm currently listening to Alice in Chains, Dillinger Escape Plan, Dark Tranquillity, Killswitch Engage and Daft Punk =) And, I'm waiting on the releases by Baths and Shpongle, they had good previous albums. "

"Hi r/postmetal.  My band Ormen Lange put out our second album ""Black"" today.  We'd love for you to give it a listen.  ","I kept waiting for the post-metal to happen and it never did. I gave up mostly through the 3rd song. The guitar player is far too obnoxious. Bass player is alright but it's one of those bands where I feel like I notice the bass more because the drumming is just sort of there and the lead guitar is committing auto-fellacio."
"Hi r/postmetal.  My band Ormen Lange put out our second album ""Black"" today.  We'd love for you to give it a listen.  ","There's a lot about this that I like, but you're probably not here for praise so much as you're looking for some CC. That said, great work!

As for the criticism, I'm really not a fan of the tones on this record, PARTICULARLY the bass tone (I'm a bassist in a post-metal band myself, so naturally that's what I've scrutinized the most). All the guitars/bass could use some more reverb, and a little of the bass's midrange and low end could use some reduction. Even with headphones with good bass response, the bass is clipping and is a little overwhelming, but not in the right way. This may be a mixing issue rather than a tone/recording one, but I can't tell having listened only to the final product.

The drums kick ass! ;)"

"Ocean Districts - Discovery ( Instrumental post-metal/rock official new video)","You might have heard of the Estonian instrumental post-metal group Ocean Districts by now. They released their debut album Expeditions back in January. Now the group debuts their first video for ""Discovery"" which features clips from the 1920 silent film Way Down East. 
Guitarist and songwriter Martin Lepalaan explains why the band decided to use scenes from this particular film: ""Our debut album Expeditions pays homage to the great explorers of our time. This video is also honoring the people willing to sacrifice their health and safety to achieve something great, be it a piece of exquisite art, film or music.
""The film is considered to have one of the most dangerous scenes ever in film history for that time. In addition Director D.W. Griffith was frostbitten on one side of his face during the shooting, and it bothered him the rest of his life. Until the day she died, leading actress Lillian Gish's right hand was somewhat impaired due to the extended filming where her hand was in the icy water. - Metalstorm.net"
"Norilsk - streaming song from new album named, ""The Idea of North"".",""
"Norilsk - streaming song from new album named, ""The Idea of North"".","Named after Siberia’s northernmost city, home of a famous metal smelting complex, Norilsk is a doom-death band from Gatineau (Québec), Canada. After releasing an EP, Japetus, in July 2014, Norilsk now unveils details about their debut album, “The Idea of North”, out on March 10, 2015. 

“The Idea of North” is a doom-death album crafted for the winter season: it has slow and crushing riffs, death growls, and atmospheric arrangements. An evocation of an ominous presence over a vast wasteland, “The Idea of North” is a massive offering that triggers the imagination. Its music draws comparison with doom-death bands such as My Dying Bride, Morgion and Ablaze in Hatred, but it also has a few atmospheric sludge/post metal elements reminiscent of Isis and Morne.

The artwork was created by talented artist Sam Ford, who designed covers for many bands including Black Cobra, Witch Mountain, Monarch and Barrowlands.

Bassist and vocalist Nicolas Miquelon comments: “We wanted graphic art for this album cover, but we also wanted continuity with the visual theme developed on the EP. I knew about Sam Ford from his involvement with the Portland doom metal scene, and I had no doubt that his twisted imagination would be the perfect catalyst to re-interpret and expand Norilsk’s initial concept. As this is Norilsk’s first full length, we couldn’t be happier to have Sam’s signature on the album, as well as to have the support of two truly dedicated Canadian labels, Hypnotic Dirge Records and Dwyer Records.”

“The Idea of North” will be available in digipack CD, cassette, and digital. Based out of Saskatoon, the black metal, doom and atmospheric label Hypnotic Dirge will release the album in a glorious digipack edition, while the Ottawa-based sludge, hardcore and post-metal etiquette Dwyer Records will have the limited cassette edition.

Full details about “The Idea of North” to be revealed at a later date.

I listened to it once and was incredibly disappointed with it, so I shelved it and didn't really bother with it again. Then, I saw Baroness live and it was one of the best metal shows I have ever seen. Absolutely incredible. I gave the album another listen, and I can appreciate it so much more now. I actually prefer the Green disc, but Yellow is amazing as well. It's no Blue Record or Red Album, but it's definitely a solid 4.5/5."

"Abandon City - Quake Falls, new song of mine, looking for some feedback, thanks!","Haha, awesome!"
"Abandon City - Quake Falls, new song of mine, looking for some feedback, thanks!","I think it should be more ""escalating"". I mean, the intro is pretty intense and it keeps going that way, it's very stable. I think it should have more ""ups and downs"", emotional changes and be more fluid. The outro though is exactly what I am talking about and it is very good. (sorry if am too judgemental, this is the kind of feedback I would be happy to hear myself about my songs)  "
"Abandon City - Quake Falls, new song of mine, looking for some feedback, thanks!","Thanks for the feedback. I feel the same way a bit, but it just seemed to come out this way. I think that's something I struggle with when writing all of the music on my own, versus jamming with people. I'll try to add more change to future tracks."
"Abandon City - Quake Falls, new song of mine, looking for some feedback, thanks!","No man I did not mean that exactly, the point is to create what you feel. I believe that there are no limits or targets when creating. I just believe that it would be much better if the dynamics escalated to a breakdown even with the same notation and synthesis. Just to be more emotional and lead in a more clear way to the ""hardest"" part of the synthesis. Maybe with clean guitar in the intro and then escalate to distortion, or the ""solo"" guitar to result in playing the riff of the second. I don't know, that's what i would be doing (the beauty of music relies on that every mind is unique though) :)
Keep creating man! Cheers"

My project, [Mountains of Light](https://www.facebook.com/mountainsoflightband), just released a [track](https://soundcloud.com/bluebedroomrecords/mountains-of-light-the-mercurial-sea) from it's upcoming split EP, and i'd greatly appreciate it if you gave it a spin and/or any feedback!

It's instrumental post-metal/rock with an emphasis on layering &amp; atmosphere and a complete disregard for time signatures. Along the lines of Cloudkicker, Intronaut, and newer Lantlos.

Thanks!"
"My instrumental post-metal band just released it's first song!","Love the banjo during the intro- really beautiful touch. I have some recommendations:

1. Make sure you spend a ton of time humanizing the cymbal velocities. When the heavy part comes in it's very obvious that they're programmed. I usually do first hit in the bar 127, then every subsequent hit around 50-80, like a real drummer. If you're using Superior, select each of your cymbals and turn the MHE knob all the way up. It's designed to make sure the stick attack gets heard and generally increases the realism of repeated cymbal hits. 

2. Try utilizing a leading melody to segue into the heavy part, and from the heavy part into the spacey part. Toughest part about writing post-metal is making things sound coherent- i.e., enough musical glue- but not so streamlined as to be boring. You've got a bunch of delay-soaked guitar leads going, so take one of them and play a melody during the initial segue that leads into that big BOOOOOM low note. Any subdominant chord will do. 

Other than that, it sounds great! Really nice start. I think the songwriting/structure just need some tightening up. That's by far the toughest thing about making music in my experience. "
"My instrumental post-metal band just released it's first song!","Thanks for the feedback! Programming drums is definitely not a strength, but I've been putting a lot of work into it, and that should help a lot.

I've been playing/writing more along the lines of thrash-death for the last bunch of years, so the textural/atmosphere-y stuff is a change of pace for me. This song was the first I'd written for the project, and the stuff I've demoed for the full length is easily leagues better in terms of songwriting and flow. As proud as I am of this song, I can't wait to get the next stuff out!"
"My instrumental post-metal band just released it's first song!","I really dug it. I look forward to hearing some more stuff!"
"My instrumental post-metal band just released it's first song!","Thanks a ton! The split will be coming out in March (the other band is Cicada the Burrower, a killer post-black metal band), and I'm in the process of working on a full length for later this year."
"My instrumental post-metal band just released it's first song!","I'm rarely impressed by a bands first release. This was really great though. Good tones and quality production are a big plus"
"My instrumental post-metal band just released it's first song!","Thanks, I really appreciate it! It's funny that you mention the production because I had no idea what I was doing, but it ended up sounding pretty decent."
"My instrumental post-metal band just released it's first song!","i have to agree. i didn't expect too much from the post title, but i've been playing the song 4 times in a row now"
"My instrumental post-metal band just released it's first song!","To be honest, although this isnt quite in my musical taste, I actually really liked it.  I think you really have some talent and would love to see you get some good recognition.  The best of luck to you!

When it comes to the style of the vocals, I'm thinking harsh vocals in the vein of ISIS and Altar of Plagues.

The project is just starting up, but I'm planning on releasing an EP quite soon. Unless my music is too terrible, that is.

(Keep in mind that it is a demo of a longer song, and it's not mixed or mastered. The drums are also just a rough sketching, and bass has not been recorded yet.)"

The first bit (0:45) sounds a bit busy with 3+ guitars all going at once; having only two guitars (e.g. 3:45) is much easier to follow. I really like the use of trumpet (wind instruments are really underused in metal).

I think the overly-busy issue will be fixed in post with more proper mixing; it's hard to get perfect separation via Guitar Pro. I was trying to have a bunch of melodic lines in counterpoint to create that controlled chaos, and later add some spoken word / yelled vocals over the majority of that phrase. And yeah, thankfully I have 10+ years of classical training on trumpet so I'll be able to do it live. Gonna add some mallet percussion and stuff later in the record too.

There is no one definition of post metal. We all have our own interpretation. I, myself, have posted a lot of black post metal (or post black metal or shoegaze black metal or whatever) because I want people to know about it. If you post something by EITS, great! Maybe that song means something to you, and you want to share it. NOT EVERYONE KNOWS WHO EITS IS. Shit. I didn't hear of ISIS until well after I started listening to post metal. Shit happens.

Don't be afraid to share with each other. All ""post-metal"" is welcome. Local bands, huge bands, news, tours, whoever. This is what this community is for, and we intend to keep it that way. So, let's share what we love.

We don't have many rules, but if you can't follow the few rules we have, then you will get banned.

The rules are in the sidebar, but here they are just for show:

* Feel free to post anything revolving around post metal. Post black metal? Sure! Post hardcore? Bring it on! Post hardened crust death stomp? Never heard of it; why not!
* If you are going to flag something, send the moderators a note! Otherwise, we will put it back!
* Are you in a band? Want us to hear your stuff? Do you think it'd fit in here? Post it!
* Got a problem? Message your lovable moderators!

Thanks again for everything, everyone! You guys all rule."
"[The Mods Love you] Note to our friendly post-metallers...","I'd like to take the time to thank you for the great job you're doing here. This is a great sub!!"
"[The Mods Love you] Note to our friendly post-metallers...","I'm gonna stick around for the post hardened crust death stomp. "
"[The Mods Love you] Note to our friendly post-metallers...","Fall of Efrafa anyone :) "
"[The Mods Love you] Note to our friendly post-metallers...","Hey guys,

Just wanted to say that we recently did the same thing in /r/postrock with who I suspect was the same user, and our first time banning anyone. I'm in total agreement with you and have always wanted our sub to be welcoming to everyone, not just a sub for those well versed in the genre. The power of our communities is in the sharing of what we love, the discussions that take place and the learning more about the genres. Be passionate about them, just don't be a dick. :) 

Keep doing what you do - Cheers!

"[The Mods Love you] Note to our friendly post-metallers...","Today is a major defeat for the trv.

All kidding aside, we're all supposed to be chillers here so let's be cool to everyone. I think this is the right thing to do for the subreddit because people were hesitant to share links before. "
"[The Mods Love you] Note to our friendly post-metallers...","That's why I brought it up with dasFisch.  I've been moderators of things before and in my younger years I'd been banhappy but I've grown up and reeeeeeally tried to give this guy as many extra chances as I could.  In the end, I feel his presence caused the effect you just mentioned; some people might hesitate to post new bands because it might not be 100% post-metal and people didn't want to get ripped on for it.

Besides, what *is* 100% post-metal these days??  Right on the front page is that band *shels and a lot of what they do wouldn't be considered post-metal, but it's fucking awesome!"
"[The Mods Love you] Note to our friendly post-metallers...","Thank you based mod!"
"[The Mods Love you] Note to our friendly post-metallers...","There have been six new posts since this modpost. That's as many as the last 7 days. "

Great job on the video too, by the way!

"Quick and easy way to describe post-metal to someone who has never heard of it?","I'm sick and tired of clumsily trying to explain post-metal every time I'm asked what kind of music I'm into.

I guess what I want to know is how the rest of you handle this sort of situation. "
"Quick and easy way to describe post-metal to someone who has never heard of it?","I usually go with ""you won't like it""."
"Quick and easy way to describe post-metal to someone who has never heard of it?","Atmospheric sludge.
The slow build and textured guitar of post-rock combined with a sludgy metal sound.
Atmospheric metal that focuses on contrasting heavy elements with beautiful tones to create an entrancing sound.

I mean shit, how do you describe music in general? It's always much easier to describe it in terms of things they already know. If you spring a bunch of new stuff on them (like having to explain sludge metal, post-rock, and atmospheric music) they're probably not going to get it anyways."
"Quick and easy way to describe post-metal to someone who has never heard of it?","""Post metal is some of the heaviest music out there, but not in the context you'd might think of. One is literally driven into a massive, overbearing landscape, as pulsating guitars crush the eardrums of the listener, the sparse and sharp drums managing to pierce through the muddled mess of distorted strings. Furthermore, your landscape has a voice, a particularly harsh one that is difficult to hear at first.""
-Matt Conrad of Sputnikmusic"
"Quick and easy way to describe post-metal to someone who has never heard of it?","That's quite the pretentious description. Captures the feeling but not much of the sound IMO."

"Quick and easy way to describe post-metal to someone who has never heard of it?","It's not an accurate description, but really all you have to do is give people a general idea/concept to process, and so I usually just go with something like ""Radiohead + Black Sabbath"" and they kinda get it. "

No need to worry about transcodes, YTs poor quality, or streaming a video. This lets you listen to the whole album (and this is an albums genre) and often bands discographies. You can also choose individual songs unlike YT. You can buy it in lossless format and lower without the need for a program and Bandcamp only takes 15% instead of 30% like other outlets. Bands will also post tour dates on Bandcamp."

"[Favor] From your loveable mods &lt;3","Hey guys,

I was dicking around on the moderator shenanigans on the sidebar, and I noticed a cute little link called, ""moderation queue."" Struck my fancy. Took a look in there, and I saw a bunch of stuff in there that people flagged. Here's the problem I found.

A lot of these flagged posts were legit, and I don't want people missing out on posts because someone decided to flag it. Now, it could have been an accident. I don't know. I was hoping you guys could start messaging us when you guys do flag stuff. We don't get any messages when someone flags a post, so those flagged posts just sit there, unnoticed.

Please give us the link title you flagged, and a reason why you flagged it. We want to make sure people aren't missing out on stuff. So, if we decide it's a valid flag, we'll leave it flagged. Otherwise, it'll come back into circulation.

I know. It is kind of nazi-ish to throw this out like this, but we wanna make sure people are getting exposed to everything. Especially in such small community, we wanna make sure people are getting everything possible.

You guys can feel free to criticize! If you guys have better ideas for resolving this type of stuff, or if you have any issues, please, feel free to drop a line in this post. We wanna make sure we are working as a community to ensure this truly IS a community.

Let us know!"

"New to this subreddit, thought I'd share some thoughts.","I found this amusing, being that as far as I know, Aaron Turner pretty much coined the phrase ""Post-Metal"", but check it out. Taken from an OMG interview for ""NO"".

""AT: What is post-metal? Did metal end at some point? We don't recognize genre – we are beholden only to our own creative whims, desire only to use of sound as a tool for the manipulation of consciousness. If we can use our music to move ourselves and listeners beyond the confines of linear time and the widely accepted notion of three dimensional space, we will consider our efforts successful. Anything less is utter failure.""

I think he's also just fucking around with the interviewer a bit there, but it does make one think. I see reposts from this subreddit in r/sludge, r/doommetal, and more. 

To me, post metal is more of a category for those who are less concerned with lumping bands into specific little sub-genres, and more of just a guideline to tunes metal-oriented, but aren't afraid to travel elsewhere. "
"New to this subreddit, thought I'd share some thoughts.","I agree to an extent.  I do feel there's a definite ""feel"" to most post-metal bands; bands that may not be very similar sonically still share some element that makes me enjoy the both of them for the same reasons.  

Most bands we'd call ""post metal"" won't describe themselves as ""post metal"" I've found.  I guess most artists don't like to limit themselves to one genre, but I feel post-metal is a pretty wide open genre and there are really not a lot of post metal bands that sound the same.  That's why I love the genre; I can listen to Terra Tenebrosa for one minute and Cult of Luna the next and they don't sound anything a like but they both give me something that bands outside the genre won't."

"My post-black-metal project; Súl ad Astral Selftitled available for stream","I liked the album.

My honest criticism:

Could use more vocals, and harsher ones at that. Then again, I really love DSBM.
It was a bit *too* post-rock. While I love that you came in from that side rather than starting with BM, it would have been nicer (and provided more variety) if it went further into BM territory at times.
Other than that is was quite enjoyable.

Now as a friendly guy:

You should be quite proud of this. It sounds great and I don't really hear too much that's more post-rock than it is black-metal. Keep up the good work and be sure to post whatever new material you have on here. Where are the download/buy links?"

Glad you enjoyed it, I not trying to impose any genre on the music, it is what it is. The new material is sitting more on the darker side (apart from a single which is B-side from the album and is getting expanded upon - its similar to the album).

"Anything else like Bossk - .1?","I love all of Bossk's work as a whole but this album in particular is just so poignant.  A lot of post metal tends to meander around.  I have a lot of patience as a listener, but there's just something ""immediate"" about the parts and riffs on this album.  I wonder if the bass parts being so good and high in the mix are what makes this record so great, among other things.

I think the same friend sent me [Neurosis - Stones from the Sky](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccRAUvqr5A4), as well as the whole Panopticon album by Isis.  

I still listen to plenty of other metal (by the way - was anyone at the Marland Deathfest this past weekend??) but post has been an easy favorite ever since discovering those bands."
"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","Rosetta. Ayil. I had copied the album to my sansa from my cousin's computer one day. Eventually listened to it, and was sold on the first song. A true masterpiece of an album!"

"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","Isis, specifically ""The Pliable Foe.""  I first heard it on Adult Swim's Metal Swim comp, and listened to it practically on loop for the longest time.  I don't think a single song has ever redefined my taste in music as much as that one."
"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","Isis - Celestial (The Tower).  I found it on a Myspace profile a few years ago.  The intro caught my attention, and how Turner's voice layered into the song kept me interested.  After that I slowly bought every Isis album, and recently have broadened my range to other bands.  

When I think back, it was an interesting discovery process.  In my teenage years I obsessed over lyrics and singing along, but when I listened to Isis, I didn't care.  About two or three years after I had started listening to Isis, I became curious what the lyrics were and then learned about the concepts behind each album.  It gave me chills.  It was like I rediscovered the band."

"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","I am fairly sure it was Cult of Luna - Back to Chapel Town that did it for me. I came from post-rock, and it instantly hit me. Then I dowe into the genre and fell in love with Isis. Nowadays post is pretty much the only metal genre I listen to, as I've widen up my musical spectrum a lot."
"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","Cult of Luna's album ""Salvation"" did it for me. Album is so fantastic from a musical and production perspective, I think it's probably one of my favorite *sounding* albums of all time."
"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","Rosetta. I was a fan of Isis, Neurosis and Godflesh, but I was stunned by the beauty of Wake.

Also I feel old posting with what everyone else is posting."
"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","I actually had no idea Neurosis ever played with Pantera.  That's awesome.  Pantera's still one of my all time favorites."
"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","dude I was like 15 or 16 so I was pretty young, but it was great. The crowd really didn't get neurosis. I remember only seeing two songs and one was through silver in blood."

That's fucking awesome. 

Unrelated to post metal, but funny: I've twice seen strangers right in front of me at concerts turn to each other after the set and say ""What the fuck did we just see?"" (Because they were astounded by how different it was, not intolerant. ) The bands in question where Kylesa and Blood Ceremony. "
"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","I think I was listening to Post-metal before I knew what it even was. Pretty sure I started on Cult of Luna (though it's hard to be sure), but being a fan of bands like Queens of the Stoneage from my mid teens, I hit the sludge pretty hard and had got into doom/drone like Sunn O))) before I'd properly explored the rest that post-metal has to offer. Had to to double back on myself!

But yeah, so Cult of Luna, Isis, Pelican, Russian Circles were all sort of the first bands of the style I got into."
"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","Not sure if this counts but the first time I heard ""farewell"" by Boris as well as 'Drought' by pelican was what did it for me.

"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","I might be alone here but post metal bands aren't always the most exciting bands to see live.  It's generally such moody, atmospheric music that all you can really do is stand there while slowly nodding your head.

But then again I'm the kinda guy who likes to jump into mosh pits at metal shows, so that may be why I don't get quite as much enjoyment out of post metal shows."
"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","I usually stay out of the pits.  I used to be a danger to others but as Ive gotten older I find that I dont like getting hot and sweaty or rubbing against other hot and sweaty dudes.  more than that I dont like hurting people or getting hurt and both were happening frequently."
"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","Do you go to any post-rock shows?

"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","Closest I've gone to is Alcest a few weeks back and it WAS pretty incredible.  As much as I love Isis and Pelican (both of whom I've seen live), I didn't enjoy them as much.  "

"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","There really aren't a lot of black metal elements - particularly in their latest release.

Maybe the lines for me are less distinctly drawn than you, but I don't find any one genre of the post-variety to be very clearly defined.  Isis and Neurosis are both considered post metal, but the two bands are pretty far apart.  Shoegaze and post-rock seem like very similar genres, to me."
"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","Neurosis should not be considered post-metal. People really need to stop that.

Shoegaze and post-rock are cousins at best. My Bloody Valentine really sounds nothing like Godspeed."

From Pelican I got into Isis and then Neurosis and everything grew from there."

As a musicology student I'm inclined to indicate that i think Neurosis can count as post metal for most working defintions of post metal.

"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","eh, without getting into school of thouht or being lame and academic, I can say that ""post"" often refers to a sort of deconstruction of something.  You can keep certain fundamental asthetic assumtions, but come at it in a radically different way.  The PostMetal we're talking about is realy only one of the way you can be a post-metal band, but it's the only prevalent stream."

Neurosis is as post-metal as Tool."
"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","I share your concern with Explosions and Earth.  I think you're silly about Neurosis and comparing them to Tool is not so much an argument as it is some sort of slander haha.  I'm not sure I have my essay ready on this one, we're going to have to agree to disagree, then I'll sneak over to r/sludge and snicker about how you thought Neurosis was sludge, instead of  ""a kinda sludgy post metal band""."
"Let's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?","Slander? I'm just saying that both have been associated incorrectly with post-metal after the fact rather than during. Also, Neurosis is totally experimental sludge. They predate post-metal. Also, people post Isis on that subreddit if that tells you anything. There's also a Neurosis link in the first 30."

Edit: Also, around the time I was getting into post metal, I would always listen to Last.fm while cooking supper. Found out about a lot of great bands in a hurry by firing up ""Isis radio"" and just listening to what came down the pipe. "

The first time I listened to this song I almost had an out of body experience, I kept listening to it on repeat for days. Downloaded Oceanic and Panopticon of ISIS without knowing that it was not ISIS who provided the vocals for Low Tide. At that time I was a shoegaze, prog rock and post rock man, not a fan of metal and harsh vocals. The first few times I listened to Oceanic and Panopticon I didn't like the vocals despite being mind-blown by the music.  One day I was in a 2 hours long drive in a deserted highway, I put on Panopticon on my phone (which is my main music player) and plug in the headphones and listen to the whole thing. There was one big difference between my previous listens and that very one, everything was different, it all clicked in my head, the lyrics, the music, the emotions it all infused together and made sense to me, and since that day I got hooked to post metal and it became one of my favourite genres. "

"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","Sorry for the joke in the title; I know that Panopticon is definitely not everyone's favorite album, but I thought it was only fitting since it is the 10th anniversary.

Anyways, so, why do you like Panopticon/Isis? Sorry for the long winded journey about how I got into Isis, but I thought it would be cool to hear everyone's journey.

So I've always been a metal head, but I could never really get into the heavy, growling metal that everyone thinks of when they think of metal. I grew up listening to Metallica, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, and Pantera, and Pantera was definitely the heaviest vocals that I ever got into. Then about four years ago, my friend and I got a new roommate, and he was wearing an Opeth shirt. I'd heard of them, but I didn't know anything about them at the time. I asked him for some suggestions on where to start, and I was told to give Black Water Park a listen (of course). It took me a couple listens, but I fell pretty hard for Opeth. From there, I went to Still Life, Ghost Reveries, My Arms...., Watershed, and to Orchid and Morningrise. I really think that Opeth opened the way for me to listen to songs with growling vocalists.

Anyways, it was about a year later, as I was getting into collecting records, that I decided I wanted to give Isis a try. I had actually seen them open for Tool back in 2006, and while I didn't know any of their songs, I still enjoyed their set. I kind of forgot about them until three years ago. So I made a post on /r/music asking people for any recommendations on Isis, and of course, two people posted (I was new to reddit and post-metal, so I didn't even think to look for /r/postmetal). The general consensus was to start mid-discography, unless I wanted to get into their more doomy stuff with Celestial, Mosquito Control, etc. For whatever reason, I ended up choosing Panopticon, and I don't know if I would have liked them if I hadn't started there.

Once the beginning of So Did We hit, I knew I was going to love this album. The beginning of the song is so brutal and heavy, and his growls just rattle your soul. And then the clean guitars kick in, and you just don't know where the song is going to go. Then the song builds again with heavy guitars, and then mellows out as the song fades into Backlit.  

Having never listened to Isis, but being a prog fan, I really liked the progressiveness of the album. There was a stark contrast between the distorted guitars and clean, reverb-y guitars, but then there are also mixes of them, and it's hard to distinguish what is going on. I think Isis did a really great job of the layering of the different tracks and having them build on top of each other to create this epic soundscape that really takes the listener to another place. The vocals can sometimes be so muted and faded that the music almost always takes the spotlight; and there are some really great instrumental sections on their songs, like the intros to In Fiction or Wills Dissolve, or the entirety of Altered Course. 

Anyways, thanks for reading this. Sorry if I started to ramble a bit at any point. I'm looking forward to hearing what you guys think as well."

"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","Panopticon is my favorite because to me it just seems like the most cohesive from start to finish. People who argue Oceanic is better have good arguments, and it's all a matter of opinion and I respect those opinions, but to me Oceanic's one problem is it doesn't have as logical a flow as Panopticon does. 

I think it's specifically that way because of where ""Weight"" comes in the album, I think having that song in the middle throws off all the mood and tempo the album builds at the start. This is not to say I don't like ""Weight"" as an individual song, fact is it's in my top 3 Isis songs in their catalog. I just think it might've worked better as a closer for the album (though Hym is also an amazing closer). Panopticon just seems so much more visionary and dramatic from my point of view. That's just my two cents."
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","We should post the album to /r/music in celebration of Panopticon to get more people on to it."
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","The first time I heard Isis was during their tour with Tool also. Similarly I didn't get into them right away the sound at the show wasn't very good and the vocals were not done justice. Your title definitely made me laugh. For me, I love Panopticon because no matter what mood I'm in it always makes me feel really good. I can just sit a chill with a drink and get lost for an hour. I was pretty devastated when they decided to break-up, (although I did get to see them perform Wavering Radiant) but then I found Old Man Gloom which I was happy for. "
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","Goddamn I am glad to see this thread. 

Panopticon is a top five album of mine and is a lost of the reason I'm aware of most of my other favorite albums. I think I probably heard The Beginning and the End or So Did We first which is sort of interesting considering they're the openers for their respective albums. 

The more I listened to Isis the more I became fond of their closers though, which is why, I guess, Threshold of Transformation is my preferred ISIS song. 

That being said, I copped [this](http://imgur.com/de89bOm) recently and am really enjoying it today. Side B is moving nicely through 'In Fiction' and Side C has the fucking massive duo of 'Syndic Calls' and 'Altered Course' that marks the album's peak for me. "
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","Dude, Threshold is a MONSTER. They closed with that when I saw them on their farewell tour; the strength of that song as a closer combined with the situation gave me goosebumps."
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","Oceanic has more of my favourite songs, but Panopticon is a better album overall. Slightly disappointed with the later albums, didn't get into them anywhere near as much :("
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","Even though I thoroughly enjoy both ITAOT and Wavering Radiant, and in some ways I think they're more well thought out than Panopticon (and certainly better produced), I think just about anything they could have done would have disappointed after Panopticon.  It's such an incredible album that it dims how good their next two albums were."
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","Like you, I got into ISIS through prog metal, which led me to their proggiest record Wavering Radiant.

I have a soft spot for Wavering Radiant, but Oceanic is my personal favourite."
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","Heh, I got into Isis when they toured with Tool that year too. It was pretty amazing seeing them both at the same time. I fell hard for Isis right away, but some of my friends didn't. I don't know if they didn't get it or what. Fast forward a few years and my buddy (who provided the tickets for that Tool/Isis show) was asking if I remembered them. I was like, HELL YEA DUDE WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT I LOVED THEM! And he was like, Well I've been really digging them lately man, I don't know why I didn't like them at first. Then he broke the news to me that they broke up and he was searching around for Red Sparrowes stuff."
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","I got into ISIS during the Panopticon tour with Dalek and Zombi opening for them at the Avalon in NYC. Changed my interest in music considerably.

Though I have a very warm spot in my heart for Panopticon (in particular So Did We and In Fiction, both of which are incredibly emotionally wroth), I have come to appreciate Wavering Radiant quite a bit, lately.

Threshold of Transformation is probably the most complete sounding ISIS song and ends that album and their career in a thorough manner.  It's the closest they got to a total Pink Floyd style of sound (particularly the extended guitar solo in mid-song, very reminiscent of Echoes). Hall of the Dead is a great opener (though not quite as crushing as So Did We) and Hand of the Host has one of the best riffs in any song.

And then there's always Celestial.

Another great little gem is the Sawblade EP. In particularly, their cover of Godflesh's [Streetcleaner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QssxY7e3qM)...."
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","For me, So Did We is the reason Panopticon is the best album. I could forget the rest and still feel that way, the song really changed my perception of music "
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","That song has to be one of the greatest of all time. It's so dark and somber. I've never heard a song that can evoke so many emotions as that one."
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","Yeah it's just unbelievable. It tops my ipod play count with about 1100 plays, and I haven't been listening to it as much as I used to a year or two ago. The song at 6:15 after the buildup, just perfect "
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","Damn, 1100 plays is no joke haha. I listen to ISIS on cd a lot so i'd guess im at around 2-300. Regardless the song/album/band is amazing."

"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","I had heard of Isis from a friend and had skimmed through Celestial then forgotten about them for a while. However one day I decided to them up on Itunes and found that Panopticon was on sale so I bought it without even thinking about it. As soon as the vibrations went through my ears I fell in love with that band and started listening to that album non-stop. Whenever I feel down that's my go to album."
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","It's the best album for feeling gloomy. Though Backlit is refreshingly upbeat."
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","Heh, your journey into metal was similar to mine.  Metallica, Pantera, ""lighter"" stuff and I couldn't stand the growls of death metal until the same exact album you mentioned, Blackwater Park.

From there I started getting REALLY into death metal until someone I used to chat with on some message board sent me a couple of songs that made me realize how much more you can get from music: Lightendday by Pelican and Stones From the Sky by Neurosis.  From there I would search out new bands similar to Pelican and Neurosis and somehow stumbled upon Panopticon and it's remained one of my favorite albums ever since.

It's kind of a joke among my friends now that the only music I *really* give a shit about anymore is post metal.  I still dig some other types of metal, and classic rock and grunge and stuff like that, but the only music that I really seek out these days is post metal.  There's just not much out there that can compare, IMO.  "
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","In the Absence of Truth is my favorite, but Panopticon is the first of them I heard. I immediately bought the album after hearing a soundbit of So Did We. "
"What is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)","TL/DR...

"Looking for more post metal like Russian Circles","I'm a huge fan of Cloudkicker (which I consider to be approximately at the fringe of post-metal, perhaps I'm wrong) and Russian Circles.
I would like to listen to some things more like them.  Any suggestions, r/postmetal?

Edit: some things I like about those mentioned above: to start with, I like the crispness of the overall sound.  It's a modern metal sound where it needs to be, but not over-saturated with gain.  

I'm also very into time signatures, so if you know of any post metal groups that do strange time signatures well I would be particularly interested in those."
"Looking for more post metal like Russian Circles","Since both bands you mentioned are (mostly) instrumental, here are some other bands without vocalists to check out.  

You probably already like Pelican, if not the new album is amazing - listen to [Deny the Absolute](http://youtu.be/TOAzNXoSJ1A) if you haven't.  There's also Set and Setting, who are really good - have a listen to [Spiraling Uncertainties](http://youtu.be/a589hTo0IyY) from the debut album.  Kerretta from New Zealand is also definitely worth your time, not always super heavy but really intricate like both Cloudkicker and Russian Circles.  [Onyxia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOT3I8IW9vQ) from their album Saansilo is one of my favorites.  You might also like Watered from Germany.  Their debut album is pretty good - check out [Keratokonis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIDZU1VPVSw)."

"Looking for more post metal like Russian Circles","This is fantastic stuff! I'm only on the second track of (III), but great so far."

For more upbeat and intense guitar based instrumental stuff check out Scale the Summit. Their new album The Migration is pretty slick."

I would also like to recommend Rosetta and The Ocean."

""Sol Eye Sea I"" is endlessly playable, and one of the catchiest instrumental albums I know of (and I can name a few, haha). ""Samus Octology"" is just as creatively wild, but definitely more raw, and chunky. 

Sheel Dave is one of the best drummers out there. "
"Looking for more post metal like Russian Circles","Dude I have been waiting for some new music from these guys for so long. I check their Facebook a few times a week looking for announcements, been a very quiet year from them.  One of my favorites for sure."

Then again, he doesn't post a lot, so it's not the best source. Not to mention Sheel has all of those nasty back problems that probably hold him back, at times. 

I'm in the same boat with Genghis Tron. They went on hiatus in 2010, and literally no word since then has been said about any aspect of the band. Mookie is a band manager for Purity Ring, Girl Talk, and some others, but nothing about work with GT.

So I think it would help if you described what it is that you like about their sound. For now, I suggest Dysrythmia, Explosions in the Sky (a bit softer), Maserati, Mogwai (some vocals) and Caspian. Now I'm going to go check out Cloudkicker since you mentioned them with Russian Circles! 

Thanks!   "
"Looking for more post metal like Russian Circles","Thanks, I've edited above.  And I saw that, but sadly they are not coming anywhere near to me :(

Pelican, Red Sparowes, and Caspian are definitely on my list when I'm in the mood for something in that vein.

I had never heard this band 'til now.  I heard a bit of Cult of Luna in this band before I knew they were Swedish, so I drew the comparison objectively.  I would say that CoL is just as much influenced by hardcore as by sludge. Is this a problem?  Must post-metal be derived from sludge? This is clearly influenced by screamo and shoegaze.  What if I posted Alcest?  That's like shoegaze with BM.  What about Amenra?  They're well sludgy, but the vocals are a bit sreamo-ey.  Where is the post-metal line drawn?

"Downfall of Gaia - Epos [album] - post/black","I definitely like this more than the 2nd album. Anyone got any other neo-crust recs besides Fall of Efrafa?"
"Downfall of Gaia - Epos [album] - post/black","I agree, and find their first album more dynamic and with nicer, less generic song structures. The new one feels more processed. I feel like it's at its best when it's more black, and in that case it sounds a lot like a shittier version of Krallice. Although nonetheless, I like it as well. (You mean ""Suffocating..."", not the split, right?)

You're probably not going to like these recs because they aren't exactly what you asked for, but here's my best shot. 

Nux Vomica (couldn't find bandcamp page within a minute): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmzjOa-JGRc

"Palms: ""Patagonia"" (Pitchfork online premiere)","I think the vocals hold it back but once it builds up the atmosphere is pretty good. Not at all post-metal as this definitely focuses on their post-rock side for the instrumentals. Not a Deftones fan and never really had that phase when I was younger but this will be interesting enough to check out."
"Palms: ""Patagonia"" (Pitchfork online premiere)","Agreed. I've never liked Deftones, mostly due to the (painful to sit through) singing, and this definitely hasn't changed my mind. 
Maybe we'll get lucky and there'll be some instrumentals on the album..."

They were amazing live. I bought the CD at the merch table.

Also yes, I was asked to play drums for them a few years ago, but they ended up finding someone else who was more geographically convenient. Fun fact: he was the drummer for Big D and The Kids Table. What the hell, right?

Also also, as to new music: I've talked with the guys a few times recently, and Irepress seems to be a dying project. Their drummer, Sheel, plays full-time with the band Bad Rabbits, and everyone else in the band is really busy with other stuff. They're gonna be putting out a six-song release later this year, but I get the idea that's gonna be the credit roll for them."

You want /r/progmetal 

Post-metal is essentially atmospheric sludge, sludge metal + post-rock. The bands you listened are prog metal bands (or artists in Cloudkickers case) that just get post-metally or post-rocky from time to time.

That being said check out [Dionaea](http://dionaea.bandcamp.com/)"

"Artists similar to Cloudkicker, Scale the Summit, Animals as Leaders","I wasn't going to be technical, but you insist, it is a subgenre:

&gt;Djent /ˈdʒɛnt/ is a heavy metal subgenre that developed as a spinoff of traditional progressive metal. The word ""djent"" is an onomatopoeia for the distinctive high-gain, distorted palm-muted guitar sound employed by Meshuggah, coined by their lead guitarist, Fredrik Thordendal. Typically, the word is used to refer to music that makes use of this sound, to the sound itself, or to the scene that revolves around it."

They drown out the guitar work, which is related to another issue; Alex Vernon is no longer playing guitar and I believe he is a signature to their sound on 'Quietly' as is Greg Lahm on 'Ties That Blind'. the new guitarists are probably the reason for the change in overall tone and the decision to pop the hell out of that snair. It's just a totally different band to me (&amp; that's just me)"

"Amenra - Am Kreuz","I've seen them a few weeks ago in Leuven (STUK) and it was just amazing!

big part of it was just the experience, the atmosphere: A dark room, filled with smoke and the scent of incense (wierrook) just made it so much more intense. Then the amazing sound there made it a whole, allround spectacle.

Also the crowd there was mostly their fans, so every song everybody was slowly headbanging along the music, feeling it, getting startled by it. At one moment I was almost in tears, because it was one of the most intense things I ever experienced.

All these things combined made that the second best show I ever saw, and it will always stay in my mind. JAW DROPPING. Hearing that they are doing loads and loads of festivals kind of makes me sad, because I think everyone should have the chance to see them in their full glory, in the right place, right atmosphere right soundsystem. Those are things that -no offense- are not (or very difficult) achievable at festivals. And for that amigo: go see them in a club, it will blow you mind.

[EDIT]: Forgot about the cinematics! They are just BANG ON! While they play, black/white film is projected behind them and it really hits the right spot!

tl;dr: Go see them in a club rather than mid day on a festival. With the right atmosphere the experience is SO MUCH MORE INTENSE."
"Amenra - Am Kreuz","Oh don't get me wrong. The show at roadburn was really intense. It was the last show on the friday night. It was in the het patronaat which is a small church.

"Iron Thrones - ""Cover of Smoke""","100% love this band and all of their roots.

Back in 2004/2005 when I was listening to a lot of metalcore, I went to a tiny club to see a pretty big band at the time, Bleeding Through.  They packed that little club elbow-to-elbow.  The opening act for them was a 6-piece deathcore group from Minneapolis with two singers called [Nehemiah](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Nehemiah/12069).  They broke up not long after that, but a few years later, I found most of the members had reformed under a new name, Everest.  They only released one EP before changing their name to Iron Thrones, because apparently there's some indie band named Everest.  You can (and should) listen to Everest's EP here: http://everestmn.bandcamp.com/"

I wonder why they are waiting until next year to release that EP if it's already done, though. I hate when bands do that."
"Rosetta announce new full length and EP","That's probably more the decision of Translation Loss. At least that's what I would assume. They've also mentioned that they're working on a split at the same time"

"Knot the Way by MitchellMinami on SoundCloud","If you could improve them, what would you have them do? Constructive criticism is always appreciated :)"
"Knot the Way by MitchellMinami on SoundCloud","I don't know if I am able to translate my feel of the song into words to describe what kind of drums &gt;I&lt; would find more fitting for the song... but I'll try:  
The song itself builds quite nicely but the main part of the drums is stale. It's for the lack of a better word - very obvious. It mimicks the instrumental part instead of adding to it. It's the same as if a singer would sing the same melody as the main instrument in the song.  
Constant open hihat takes away from the power of the song instead of adding to it, when it's always open. 

Two more things, the keys seem to be a little too loud throughout the song (minor mix adjustments would fix it), and the final keys in the double bass section seem to be off to the beat (maybe it's your artistic choice).  

If you would care to share the instrumental part - I could try to lay my interpretation of drums.

A second or two of music then cutting away? Can't even really see anyone doing anything? Really boring shots? It's all over the place and for no good reason.

Remember Converge's teaser for Axe to Fall? That's how you do this sort of thing."

"Away With Words - Retrospect EP (Milwaukee WI)","I dig it, because I listen to this kinda stuff as well (also, go Wisconsin). That being said...

I think this would probably get more love in /r/Metalcore. Or maybe /r/progmetal. This band seems to have a strong BTBAMish influence, who are (for the most part...) especially well received in the latter sub. 

I'm not saying they're not post-metal, because I'm not the friggin' post-police, but if you give a listen to the bands in the ""Legends"" section of the sidebar, you'll hear why those other subs might be a better fit and posting them there will help expose your friends' band to an audience who will be more in tune with their overall sound."
"Away With Words - Retrospect EP (Milwaukee WI)","Awesome! And yeah they call themselves post metal but their kinda ambiguous genre wise, closer to a proggy metalcore band like you said haha"
"Away With Words - Retrospect EP (Milwaukee WI)","Glad to help!

"Lesser known post-metal bands?","Giant Squid, Russian Circles, and Kylesa aren't post-metal. I see where you're coming from with Russian Circles but they're not sludgy. They're just a metal influenced post-rock band. Either way not a bad gateway into this genre.

Lesser known: Lightbearer, Arktika, Carontte, Consiousness Removal Project, Downfall of Gaia (more so neo-crust but a lot of similarities there), Fall of Efrafa (Pre-Lightbearer, also neo-crust but fans of this genre tend to like it), North, Omega Massif, Rosetta, Sika Redem (not pure, they mix a lot of genres), Spook the Horses, Tidings.

Not all of the stuff from my library but this is all of the stuff I know I like or remember liking without getting too far out there with genre boundaries.

edit: I might be thinking of Grayceon when I think of Giant Squid. I always get them confused."
"Lesser known post-metal bands?","I still don't understand exactly what ""post-metal"" is. It confuses me even more that in an old man gloom interview Aaron Turner pretty much dismisses it entirely (unless the dude was joking). I do know that I enjoy most of the bands that fall into the genre. I just don't see how Isis or Rosetta would be post-metal while Russian Circles and Kylesa aren't."
"Lesser known post-metal bands?","Every band in every genre dismisses that it exists or that they're in it. Very common in post-rock.

Kylesa is just sludge metal. I've already explained Russian Circles.

Basically it's post-rock + sludge. Or just really atmospheric sludge."
"Lesser known post-metal bands?","""We don't use that label, &lt;insert genre label&gt;. We find it limiting and consider ourselves to be much more diverse  than &lt;insert genre label&gt; implies."" -Every band ever

There's a El Ten Eleven interview where they basically say that and then to further distance themselves they go on to say, not only are they not post-rock, but they personally hate post-rock. Never cared for their music, but I had to laugh at that particular, um, marketing tactic."
"Lesser known post-metal bands?","I kind of get it. As a musician, you don't want to say, ""I make &lt;insert genre name here&gt;."" because it can limit your creative focus or your audience. Let the music speak for itself seems to be most people's answer. "
"Lesser known post-metal bands?","Bingo. The genres are just for us  to make things easier to categorize and talk about. The bands really shouldn't care or worry. They should just create the art they want to create."
"Lesser known post-metal bands?","I think Empros is very post-metal. Enter not so much. Some bands you can't lump together into a genre. Like *shels. Laurentian's Atoll has a weirdly prog rock vibe to it for the first half the album even though most of their music is very post-metal. It's like Porcupine Tree met Atreyu met Zozobra."

"Any postmetal bands using non-conventional instruments?","Hi r/postmetal,
I'm relatively new to the genre and gearing up for the journey of discovery. As I was listening to some reddit-recommended albums, I had the thought that I'd really enjoy a strings-based band making postmetal, kind of like what Apocalyptica did for heavy metal. 

So, expanding the concept, are there any postmetal bands/artists you'd like to recommend that use alternative/non-conventional instruments?

Hopefully this is not a dumb or terribly uninformed post, thanks for your understanding if it is."
"Any postmetal bands using non-conventional instruments?","Red Sparowes is well known for extensive use of a pedal steel guitar."
"Any postmetal bands using non-conventional instruments?","I didn't want to pimp my own band on here since I'm fairly new to this sub, but since you asked specifically: [here is a video of our first show ever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad8V09LW94E), featuring our violin player James. (If you want to skip the into go to about ~4:45) We are getting better and once we have a proper album I'll probably go ahead and pimp it out here."
"Any postmetal bands using non-conventional instruments?","Thanks, you guys sound good, this is indeed the kind of thing I'm looking for. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you use two basses instead of a guitar and bass for some songs right? (That's really cool! :) )

Much success for the album."
"Any postmetal bands using non-conventional instruments?","Thanks! Yes, we uses two basses (one 5-string, one 4) for some some songs, for others I play a baritone guitar. "

"What are your favourite post metal songs of all time, and why? [Discuss]","Ill post mine, and yes i know this is very hard to anwser, haha.
It's not impossible i will forget some songs here.
  

**ISIS - Grinning Mouths:**  
  
*The song that got me into post metal, I've always been a metal head but could never put a name on this style of metal before. Even tho, shockingly i had seen Cult of Luna and Burst live about 2 times before that.*  
   

**Cult of luna - Vicarious Redemption / Cult of luna - Mute Departure:**

*My favourites of the Vertikal album, both songs have an amazing payoff after the build up. And most other CoL songs aswell but i felt like mentioning these.*
    


**Pelican - Drought:**  

*One of my favourite heavy ball crushing riff songs. I wish i knew more of these kind of songs. The Album Ghost by Buried at Sea reminds me of this song, and that is also a great album!*

  

**Rosetta - Europa/Wake/A Determinism Of Morality:**

*Rosetta are probably one of my favourite post metal bands, along side with ISIS and CoL. Atmosphere is a big thing for me in music, and i think Rosetta build an amazingly thick atmosphere and that's why i like them so much*

**Amenra - Boden (vinyl version):**  
  
I like all of Amenra's songs equally, As goes for every one of these bands ofc. Amenra delivers a real authentic feeling of pain, Wich almost touches you through the speakers. The vocalist here is amazing and one of my favourites to date!  
  
This was written from start to finish so i am certain i forgot to name some songs that i would have wanted to include. 
"
"What are your favourite post metal songs of all time, and why? [Discuss]","How good is Vertikal. I think it's CoL's best yet.

"What are your favourite post metal songs of all time, and why? [Discuss]","ISIS is that band to a lot of people."
"What are your favourite post metal songs of all time, and why? [Discuss]","I always forget about Pelican because I find them mostly underwhelming, but that one song...""March Into The Sea"" - whichever version is 20 minutes long. That song is *awesome*. "
"What are your favourite post metal songs of all time, and why? [Discuss]","Drought is the song that got me into post metal."
"What are your favourite post metal songs of all time, and why? [Discuss]","[Buried Inside - Time as Imperialism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnd5q3Feui0)

This is one of the first Post Metal groups I got into. This album is best played through in entirety, and the theme regarding time and how it controls all aspects of life was really powerful and unique IMO. The lyrics are a bit pretentious, but still really thought provoking:

&gt; The calendar year is an imperial narrative. The seven-day week is an imperial infliction. Circannual holidays are imperial flag-posts. Mechanical time is an imperial installation. The merchant workday is an imperial offering. Greenwich MeanTime is an imperial sanction. The looming weight, uniformly imposed; as albatross and as anchor. The new time-imperialists will get their way with those left: the rural, the feral, the frail. Feed them a thread, that leads to a string. They'll follow the string, until it leads to a rope, and from that rope every vestige of what was will be hung by the neck."
"What are your favourite post metal songs of all time, and why? [Discuss]","Haven't hear this band before, gonna play the album from start to finish. thanks!

I finished it, incredible album, thanks for sharing.
I said to myself on the last song, i hope they finish strong, and they fuckin sure did! "
"What are your favourite post metal songs of all time, and why? [Discuss]","I'll try to list some that haven't already been mentioned:

 -

[Fall of Efrafa - The Warren of Snares](http://youtu.be/18AiWl0zjZQ)

This is perhaps my favorite song of all time. It's an epic post-metal/crust hybrid that concludes a concept trilogy of albums about bunny rabbits. What's not to love?

 -

[Battle of Mice - At the Base of the Giant's Throat](http://youtu.be/C1CkdF7uoKk)

I like this one because it makes me very uncomfortable.

 -

[Cloudkicker - The warmth of the daytime seemed like a dream now / A weather front was stalled out in the Pacific​-​-​like a lonely person, lost in thought, oblivious of time](http://youtu.be/RhkRbZ5sf3M)

This is actually two songs, but they belong together. Cloudkicker is definitely one my my favorite bands, but I don't think I can really articulate what it is that makes it so awesome.

 -

[Russian Circles - 309](http://youtu.be/JtpFOBJA7O8)

It has nice structure and texture.

 -

[Blindead - Affliction XXVII II MMIX](http://youtu.be/VBCYnKooC-I)

[Ocoai - Breatherman](http://youtu.be/UjNJ1Uc1BVc)

[North - Ghosts Among Us](http://youtu.be/DCKeyhDY4JA)"
"What are your favourite post metal songs of all time, and why? [Discuss]","Mouth of the Architect - Wake Me When It's Over. I don't think I've ever replayed a song so many times. I can't really explain it.

Giant Squid - Metridium Fields. Baroness - Wailing Wintry Wind.

Among other things already posted here. I could gush for pages about ISIS.

Also, this song by a band called Throne of Mars: http://throneonmars.bandcamp.com/track/pathfinder"
"What are your favourite post metal songs of all time, and why? [Discuss]","Way to post an overwhelmingly huge question. I tend to respect post-metal in album form more than song form, but I'll try to answer the question as posed.

The ""why"" for most of these is ""because it's awesome"", but what makes post-metal awesome to me is either excellent build-up and climax, or uniqueness and creativity deviating from the ""typical"" post-metal song format. 

**Creativity:**

* Burst ""(We Watched) The Silver Rain"", ""City Cloaked""

* Callisto ""Wormwood"", ""Latterday Saints"", ""Pathos""

* Cult of Luna ""Sleep"", ""Owlwood"", ""Ghost Trail"", ""Vicarious Redemption""

* Inter Arma ""'sblood"", ""The Cavern""

* Irreversible ""Sins"", ""Iblis"", ""Synaesthesia""

* Rosetta ""A Determinism of Morality"", ""Départe"", ""Itinérant"", ""Au Pays Natal"", ""Monument"", ""TMA-1"", ""Clavius""

* Word as a Virus ""Avoid the Light"", ""Farewell to Sanctity"", ""Heroin"", ""The Diamond Sea""

**Epic buildup/heaviness:**

* Crib45 ""Borderlines"", ""Into the Abyss""

* Cult of Luna ""Echoes"", ""Finland"", ""Dim"", ""Dark City, Dead Man""

* Huldra ""Ursidae"", ""The City in the Sky""

* Isis ""Celestial (The Tower + Signal Fills the Void)"", ""Holy Tears"", ""The Beginning and the End"", ""False Light"", ""So Did We"", ""In Fiction"", ""Syndic Calls""

* Neurosis ""Given to the Rising"", ""At the Well"", ""My Heart for Deliverance"", ""Through Silver in Blood"", ""The Doorway""

* Potmos Hetoimos ""The Crumbling Dam/Avalanche"", ""Pulpit Despotism"""

"What are your thoughts on the new Callisto album?","as the title suggests. thoughts on the newest Callisto album Secret Youth. I thought it had it's shining moments with tracks like Pale Pretender and Breasts Of Mothers. Saw them live on the week the album came out and was really really disappointed in their live set. The songs were played great but somehow I got the feeling none of them enjoyed playing and just wanted to leave the stage."
"What are your thoughts on the new Callisto album?","I thought it was a step up from ""Providence"", but still a far cry from ""Noir"" (my second-favorite post-metal album ever) and ""True Nature Unfolds"". I just don't think the sound they're going for now with the new vocalist is all that appealing, though I applaud them for at least trying something unique. I was reminded of Woven Hand (or David Eugene Edwards in general) a lot on ""Secret Youth"", which was pleasant. I could totally imagine this material translating poorly to a live setting. It's become very introspective, low-energy music."
"What are your thoughts on the new Callisto album?","I somehow love the way the vocalist Jani does the harsh vocals but his clean singing mannerisms are not that enjoyable at times. I dig some of the cleans too as they remind me a bit of another band from Svart Records called Beastmilk but that's pretty much it. Noir is and will be one of post-metal's epitome albums."

"Heavy like a whale fucking a cement truck. Omega Massif - Unter Null.","Pelican's ""[Drought](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWrJGqz6nZ4&amp;hd=1)"" has a similar heaviness.  Year of No Light's whole ""[Ausserwelt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ-8umEo8YU)"" EP is excellent, and has even more atmosphere.  "

"Brian Cook of Russian Circles, These Arms Are Snakes &amp; Botch weighs in on Piracy",""
"Brian Cook of Russian Circles, These Arms Are Snakes &amp; Botch weighs in on Piracy","Great article. To put it into perspective, I've never purchased a single Russian Circles album, yet I have all of them on my mp3 player and I've been listening to them for years.

I've seen them about 7 or 8 times live now, and I buy a t-shirt at every show. Hell, I even donated money to the guys when they had that accident a few years ago where their van was wrecked and Dave had his drums destroyed. 

Am I a pirate? Sure am. Do I still support the bands that I think are worthy of my money? You bet. "
"Brian Cook of Russian Circles, These Arms Are Snakes &amp; Botch weighs in on Piracy","Wow, this is very close to what I think, as well. 

I constantly look for new bands, and I also pirate a *lot* in the process. However, I'm also spending money on buying quite a lot of music, because, similarly to Brian, I want the real albums. I want a physical item, and not just a self burnt disc or a mixtape, I want *the real deal*. A symbol of my appreciation or love for the band or artist.

Lately, I've also started buying more LPs, even though I don't have the appropriate equipment to play that format. Why? Because usually, if I really like a band (which I probably do, if I'm buying their records), I already have their albums, most likely in a very high quality format as well. So I might as well cough up ten bucks more, support the artist with it and get something even better myself. 

Being a poor student, however, I don't have all that much money to spend on albums, but I will slowly and surely support the artists I appreciate the most. And deepest apologies for Brian: although I'm an avid Russian Circles fan, I've yet to purchase any records; something I'm hoping to fix ASAP. I did pay to see Russian Circles live last spring, I hope that counts as being supportive!"
"Brian Cook of Russian Circles, These Arms Are Snakes &amp; Botch weighs in on Piracy","Looks like Brian is keen on the status of the recording industry in addition to being an awesome musician. I saw RC live last month and the best way I could come up with to support the band was to buy Empros on Bandcamp in Lossless format. While it's not the same as getting a physical CD, I support Bandcamp because it's a very forward-thinking business model that actually respects artists, unlike most conventional record labels. I believe it's a 70-30 split between the artist and Bandcamp. I pirate just as much as anyone, but I try to support the artist whenever possible."
"Brian Cook of Russian Circles, These Arms Are Snakes &amp; Botch weighs in on Piracy","&gt;recording industry 

He's not really talking about the industry. He explicitly states:

&gt;""this isn’t about money as much as it is about entitlement and maintaining a sustainable underground infrastructure""

He's talking about keeping independent record labels and distributors alive, not major labels.

Bandcamp only takes 15%. The artist will only get the other 85% if it's self-published which isn't the norm for many who actually make money off of Bandcamp. That will be through a label."

"Rosetta - Europa","any chance of a source? I try to keep up to date with them but they don't have a lot on them, do they, lol"
"Rosetta - Europa","Mike Armine (Rosetta's vocalist) mentioned it on this [podcast](http://www.mbnpodcast.com/) that he appears on occasionally... I can't remember which episode it was on though... It might have been episode 15. Their drummer, BJ Murtrie is on it every week but he doesn't really talk about Rosetta all that much. It's a pretty entertaining podcast most of the time, I recommend listening to it.

EDIT: They also mentioned the EP a few times on their blog, [http://rosettaband.com/](http://rosettaband.com/), but Armine specifically mentioned the NIN style track in the podcast."
"Rosetta - Europa","awesome thanks! i'll take a look into it.  
Armine is awesome. Sent him an email a couple years ago asking for an autograph on a Wake/Lift CD i purchased from them (plus a bit of extra money as support), he got the whole band to sign it.  They're all awesome"

"Rosetta - Europa","Nice! I saw them in Canberra, I also went nuts. Did you get a chance to chat to any of them before or after the show?"
"Rosetta - Europa","Yeah bought a shirt from Armine and shook his hand making sure he knows how my friends and I idolise him. And then walked up to the drummer after they played the final song and shook his hand too. Was awesome, pity I couldn't stay round for any longer.

But what was awesome, Brisbane was the last gig of their down under tour, and they left for a plane flight about 20 minutes after they finished, so all the supporting bands ended up jumping in for the last song and it was just so mental. Supporting bands playing unplugged instruments was a nice touch."
