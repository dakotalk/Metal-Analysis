"Mötley Crüe - Live Wire","If only they were still this good. I saw them last year and Vince just really needs to stop for good. Every one else was alright, but Vince forgot half the words and ran out of breath a lot. Kick ass band, just not as good"
"Mötley Crüe - Live Wire","That's disappointing to hear. I saw em a few years back and they rocked. I have tickets to see them twice on their farewell tour, so I hope they bring it. "

"Whitesnake - Here I Go Again","Man, David Coverdale can really belt out the tunes. When Whitesnake released ""Whitesnake"" the whole world went nuts (I assume) when it went 8x Platinum. Tawny Kitaen's appearance in this video became our first crush. But holy shit is the album jammed packed with great songs. Still of the Night, Here I go Again, and the balled Is This Love, all grace this amazing album. This album is a must for lovers of Hair Metal."

"Kiss - Let's Put The X In Sex","Nice. I'm going to see KISS tomorrow. It would be hilarious if they whipped this out but they probably prefer to forget it along with its companion (You make me) Rock Hard. 

Paul Stanley you're fuckin' ridiculous sometimes. "
"You guys might find this interesting","As you probably know, the sub at /r/metal is (and always has been) fairly unfriendly to glam/hair metal and is basically filled with pretentious twats and elitist dicks.  But if you like variety in your metal and listen to Motley Crue and Dokken right along-side Emperor and Cannibal Corpse then you might enjoy
/r/RealMetal, the new sub that is meant to be ""/r/metal without the elitism and douchebaggery"".

If you feel like it, drop by and have a look, comment on a link or whatever.  Hair / glam / sleaze are absolutely welcome there (and there's some good stuff up already).
"
"You guys might find this interesting","I don't know who Emperor or Cannibal Corpse is, but I might check it out for the Motley Crue and Dokken. To be honest I didn't even check out /r/metal, I went straight for the hair. And to be brutally honest most ""metal"" music sucks, so they can keep it (I only mean that really crappy stufff). 

Thanks for the heads up"

"Vain - Far Away Lirycs","Wow, I never thought I'd see another fan of Vain on reddit! (Much less of a song from a hard-to-find album that had not come out until nearly two decades after it was first recorded) I just listened to the song off my copy of the album to transcribe the lyrics, here you go:

It's far away...

Hot girls on a crowded street  
Chasing success, it's pretty sweet  
But too bad, it's still far away  
I should've tried harder to make you stay

It's real hard when you live in the city  
It's real hard when you're far away  
Well I stooped pretty low to get what I wanted  
Forgot baby that it's really you  

Well hang loose 'cause it's pretty rough  
To be with me you gotta hang on tough  
You dream of glamour, and fortune and fame  
Look in the mirror are you still the same?  
I don't think so

It's real hard when you live in the city  
It's real hard when you're far away  
Well I stooped pretty low to get what I wanted  
It's not here tomorrow, no it's not here today

It's real hard when you live in the city  
It's real hard when you're far away  
Well I stooped pretty low to get what I wanted  
Forgot baby that it's really you  

Not today  
Far away  
Maybe it's you I really want

Not today  
Far away  
Maybe it's you I really want (check out)

It's real hard when you live in the city  
It's real hard when you're far away  
Well I stooped pretty low to get what I wanted  
Forgot baby that it's really you

It's far away  
You know it's never too late

"Steel Panther - Community Property","I love Steel Panther.  You wouldn't expect a comedy band to be this talented.  ""Satchel"" is a great guitar player with really good job.  The production on all of their stuff is great.  I hope to see them live some day, I hear their shows are hilarious.  Their music is really good and you've got to love the cheesy lyrics.  Sometimes the lyrics are unbearable though, for example I can't sit through the song ""Weenie Ride"" - that one is a bit too much for me.  But songs like ""Turn out the Lights"" are serious blood pumping head bangers.  "

"Please help me identify this 80/90's hair metal music video and custom guitar.","I recall watching a music video in ~1991-1992 in which a guitarist played a green electric guitar with a painting of a woman on it.
It was for a late 80's/early 90's hair metal band like Guns N Roses, Poison, Aerosmith, etc.
To my memory the guitar was a simple Fender-style guitar with dark green paint; the illustration of the woman was in the 1950's pin-up tradition, as seen on tattoos and WWII planes.

I feel like the guitar was either an integral part of the story in the music video, or it held my interest as a child because the guitarist was treating the guitar sensually, perhaps because he was comparing it to a woman.

My initial memory was that Slash from Guns N Roses was playing this guitar, and that he threw it off a cliff in the music video. Upon relating the story to a friend, he challenged this version of the story, saying that Slash played nondescript guitars, while saying that he vaguely remembered the green guitar I described.

A subsequent Google Image search revealed that the scene I remembered of Slash casting his guitar off of a tall rock formation appeared in the video for 'November Rain,' and it was indeed a different guitar, Slash's trademark 'plain' Les Paul.

The last thing I have to add about this guitar is that, as a child, I had the impression that it was a ""famous guitar""... it was someone's trademark guitar, and I may have even seen it featured by itself in 'Hit Parade' magazine.

So, who owned this beguiling guitar, and what music video was it featured in?"
"Please help me identify this 80/90's hair metal music video and custom guitar.","Sorry, I don't have an answer, but there's a whole subreddit for trying to get people to help you remember something: /r/tipofmytongue/

Maybe try posting the same question there. Good luck!"
"Please help me identify this 80/90's hair metal music video and custom guitar.","Spent a lot of time watching metal videos during that time period and....I've got nothing. My advice....start sifting through episodes of Headbangers Ball on Youtube. You might find it. "
"Please help me identify this 80/90's hair metal music video and custom guitar.","Yeah Ive seen more Hair Metal videos and guitars than I can recall but the only guitarists I ever saw with pinups or green guitars were CC Deville, Bruce Bouillet, and if I recall the guitarist from Enuff Z Nuff. "

"Scrap Metal","Just saw them this weekend. Interesting format of getting a bunch of singers together to do a show. Had Mark Slaughter, the Nelson twins, Eric Martin, Janet Gardner, and Kip Winger there.  
There were some hiccups, but overall was a good show. Worst hiccup was that it sounded like everyone there was playing and singing in a different key for Love and Affection.  
Eric Martin tore it up, I thought. Oddly enough with Matthew Nelson playing bass all night (except for when Winger was on) they did not play Addicted to that Rush.  =P
Winger had the crowd going as well. Looking at the potential lineups, I could have enjoyed Stephen Pearcy and/or Joey Lynn Turner as well.  
So, if you hear they are in your area, could be worth it to just get the hits from them."

"Ruck a Pit Bridge by Tuff","Ahhh, 1991 what a time to live in... sorta. Hair Metal is dying quick and this little known band called Tuff released one of their biggest albums known to date with ~~Nevermind~~ What Comes Around Goes Around. Right off the bat this song ""Ruck a Pit Bridge"" brings in what this whole album is about, pure hair bliss. While Nirvana got angsty and lead singer Kurt Colbain itched the back of his skull with a shot gun blast, Tuff is still kicking it with their release of What Comes Around Goes Around...Again. If you had told me that Tuff would be still around, I would never have believed it, mostly due to the loud person yelling into my mothers stomach. "

"Help with Hair Metal threads.","Hi guys.

Steel Panther are playing in my city soon and I'd love to go in full regalia this time. Problem is it's proving to be a bit of a problem finding the proper clothes. Anyone know of anywhere I can get some Hair Metal clothes? Stuff like tights, leather pants, ripped t-shirts, big bandanas, random bits of glittery fabric, stuff like that. "
"Help with Hair Metal threads.","Try online. I got a leather jacket and leopard print tights from Forever 21, and some leather boots with chains and zippers from Rue21.  Everything was extremely cheap. Boots were like 20 bucks, jacket was 25 and tights were under 15. Bandanas are like a buck at Walmart; selection is limited but the basics work just fine. 

Wigs you can get at your local halloween/costume place or at Party City. Basic wigs run in the 20-30 dollar range and should last several uses. If you get a packaged wig, make sure to get it out and wear it for a while prior to the event to make sure that it sits right.

Cutting your own tshirts is easy too, just look on youtube. I like to check out hot topic for vintage band tees every time I'm at the mall, then just cut the sleeves off. Unfortunately hot topic is super overpriced, so if anyone knows a better source please let me know.

I highly recommend eyeliner as well. I use a liquid pen. The pencils work fine but require a little more effort and they are prone to break."
"Help with Hair Metal threads.","check the women's section of Wal Mart and just get all the tacky shit you can. 

When I was playing metal bands (I'm old) we would go to thrift shops or GoodWill for stage outfits. It wasn't until the late 80s that anyone could afford leather anyway"

"NITRO - Long Way From Home","I agree, they were definitely a super talented band.  MAB is still touring and just as awesome as ever.  He even had a new quad guitar built (the first one in Nitro was stolen on tour).  Even their lesser known stuff is amazing.  Jim &amp; Mike did an independent album called Proud to be Loud shortly before Nitro was officially formed.  It's on Youtube and its pretty cool.  Mike is one of the fastest + most articulate guitar players out there, every note he plays is very clean, he makes other shredders look sloppy."
