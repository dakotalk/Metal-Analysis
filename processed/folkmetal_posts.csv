"Turisas2013 Now on Spotify in the US","Just a heads up, Turisas2013 is available on Spotify in the US a day early, album release isn't technically until 9/3. Go forth and mull this album over."
"Turisas2013 Now on Spotify in the US","I like it as an album, but don't like it as a Turisas album (where I compare everything to Varangian Way.)"
"Turisas2013 Now on Spotify in the US","This.  I was introduced to Turisas via SUAF, and this album still doesn't sound like Turisas.  However, as an album, it is fantastic.  If I don't compare it to the others, this is a very strong album, albeit more of a power metal sound that folk metal."
"Turisas2013 Now on Spotify in the US","I like to think of it as a Turisas Rock Opera.

We Ride Together is their big closing number, in a story about how they used to raid the metal scene until the band broke up due to stylistic differences, but years later each member found their true calling and reunited as an act on Broadway!"
"Turisas2013 Now on Spotify in the US","This album is definitely growing on me.  It seems that Turisas has forged their own sound that isn't really folk anymore, but definitely still battle metal inspired.  In fact, the only problems I really have with it at this point are the GOD AWFUL 'Run, Bhang-Eater, Run!' and that weird high-pitched 'March of the Varangian Guard' chorus in 'No Good Story Ever Starts With Drink...'"

"Einherjer - Berserkergang [5:57]","I love this band, but I can never listen to them without mentally viewing the [greatest music video of all time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmG9y7StBXw)."

"Skálmöld &amp; Sinfóníuhljómsveit Íslands - Kvaðning (the drummer is having the time of his life)","Such a contrast with the two dudes immediately next to him who are having a fucking blast"
"Skálmöld &amp; Sinfóníuhljómsveit Íslands - Kvaðning (the drummer is having the time of his life)","I saw Skalmold live a few months ago. Their drummer really had fun and it showed ; I bet he's one hell of a party guy. I'd love to have a beer with him someday, he seemed so genuine. Cheers"
"Skálmöld &amp; Sinfóníuhljómsveit Íslands - Kvaðning (the drummer is having the time of his life)","This is one of those bands that I think I am going to have to travel to see, because I doubt they'll ever come to Australia."
"Skálmöld &amp; Sinfóníuhljómsveit Íslands - Kvaðning (the drummer is having the time of his life)","Looks like it. I just checked all of their past and present tour dates and they've yet to break out of Europe. Maybe in a couple of years they might go global, they definitely have the potential, but until then... enjoy your trip to Iceland."

"Alestorm - The Sunk'n Norwegian",""
"Alestorm - The Sunk'n Norwegian","I saw these guys live back in fall. When they played Nancy the Tavern Wench, no one in the mosh pit knew what to do so we all just sat down in a line and started rowing a boat. Christopher Bowes face as he just stared at us was hilarious.
Another band to look into is Gloryhammer. founded by the same guy but leans more towards medieval castles and whatnot instead of pirates. "

Just felt like sharing my joy."

"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate",""
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","I downloaded this album, and occasionally the singer would say ""This is a recording off the new Alestorm album.  Remember, piracy is a crime!"" dubbed over the music.

I believe that this bootleg with the piracy warning is the definitive version of the album."
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","""Yarr, Yer listenin' to the new Alestorm album, ""Black Sails at Midnight"". This song is called, ""Black Sails at Midnight"". Remember, Piracy is a crime!""

Even after buying the album, I keep a burned copy of the bootleg in the car, and I have to agree that this is the best version.

Yes I do have the warning memorized."
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","I know Napalm Records does that with all early press-release copies of albums. That way if a torrent or leak appears they tell that someone who they sent a copy of the album before its release had gone and leaked it on the internet. 

It kind of bit them in the ass though because it's pretty hilarious to have a ""Pirate"" metal band saying ""piracy is a crime, yarr!"" and most people thought it was just intentionally part of the album when they downloaded it."
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","Such a killer band there really needs to be more pirate metal around "
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","Agreed, Folk metal has focused too much on Vikings. We need to acknowledge the other epic seafarers as well!"
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","While I agree that Alestorm, pirate metal and the theme in general are nothing short of awesome, I think that it would grow old real quick if many more bands would take a shot at it. Pirates lack the expansive universe with gods, myths, epic heros and great battles. At the end of the day it all comes down to rum, cannons, swords and wenches. Awesome in its own right of course, but not exactly something you can build a whole subgenre around without it growing boring real fast."
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","I do agree that there is not a whole lot that you can base a genre around But swashbuckler and Alestorm while differnt types of metal both fit into the Pirate sea songs and they are  both great"
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","Much better than the original. "
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","I don't think the children would agree:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ju_10NkGY

:)"
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","Definately my favorite band out there!....Can't wait to see them very soon!"
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","Yea, it's really too bad the band isn't as into it as their fans seem to be. I have a buddy who was in Folkearth and hung with the Alestorm guys a few times. I guess they like to refer to themselves ""some shit pirate metal band"" and almost none of them actually like metal all that much. This was a few years ago, and they were also supposedly relatively disillusioned by the fact that  that they were contracted for a four album deal, with only two out so far, and were heavily considering breaking up after the contract is up.

Not sure how they feel nowadays, but they've been touring to the states a lot, and that's a good a sign imo."
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","I doubt that they are not into metal. At least the singer is. I was at a few festivals where they played and saw Chris(the singer) in the crowd at lot of bands' shows. "
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","The singer also started a second goofy metal band (Gloryhammer), so I assume that he at least is into it. The keyboardist has looked pretty bored both times I've seen Alestorm live, but I suppose he really doesn't have much to do."
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","When they rolled through for Paganfest a few years ago I got to speak with Dani, their guitarist. One of the most genuine and nice people I've ever met, the whole 'were a shit pirate metal band' is just self depricating fun, they are into it and seem to have cool plans for the future."
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","I saw them on the 11th. They were great! Unfortunately I expended most of my energy during TrollfesT's set... Two fantastic bands, it was nice to see them together."
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","I will be seeing them on the 8th of Dicember and i am hoping this is one of the concerts i have been waiting anxious since a long time!"
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","Hi, I'd like to know why you're so beautiful.
"
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","For some reason I just don't like alestorm. "
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","Go see them live, and I'm pretty sure your opinion will change.  My friends who don't even like metal love Alestorm."
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","Oh I don't doubt they put on a great show and it'd be a hell of a time with the dancing and drinking like most folk metal shows. But it's just something about their recordings that I don't like for some reason. "
"Alestorm - You Are a Pirate","Better yet, hang out drinking with Danny and Chris. Good times."
"WHYBLT - What Have You Been Listening to - Idea from /r/Metal","Hey guys, I came on to the sub reddit and saw very little activity. So I decided I would share some of the folk metal I have discovered recently. But then I thought actually instead of just spam, I'll put it all in one place and see if anyone else has anything to add.

Of course you can write about any band here but just let us know what you've been listening to, what you like about them and anything you want to add :) I'll start off:

**[Myrkgrav - De To Spellemenn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBt8im6q8xw)** - I've already posted this here but I just can't get enough of this stuff. I've been listening to this on repeat everyday at work for around 2 weeks now and I cant get bored of it. A few days ago I got in contact with Lars Jensen through reddit and he seemed like a great guy and also put me on to the fact that he is still working on follow up album to this. It's been 8 years in the works so far and sounds amazing [so far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-E1Q_yVr2U)

**[Otyg - Trollslottet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx4HgWPjIEY)** - Here's another one I keep coming back to, brilliant clean folk metal with some heavy riffing to remind you that this is still metal :) Love this guys vocals too.

**[Lumsk - Nokken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hHUqMiFfqU)** - This song alone has so my replay ability, that riff is gripping and as hell. At first I wasn't so turned on to the female vocals but the contrast with the riffing and harmony with the additional  'folky' instruments is growing on me.

**[Svartsot - Jotunheimsfærden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-FvAeMrjGo)** - Solid on every track, there really isn't much to say about Svartsot, they are simply great. Also they happen to be pretty humorous on their facebook page.

**[Vanir - Hlidskjalf gynger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuvuldvxP9U)** - Another great danish band (Svarsot are danish too), this ones slightly more cheesy but there's nothing wrong with that right :) Great for having a nice uplifting time.

So that's the best of the folk from the past few weeks. On top of that I've been delving into other genres but I wont bore you with those here :) So I'll just quickly list them:

Uriah Heep - Exciter - Cirith Ungol - Junior Bruce - Brothers of Conquest - Buzzov - en - BLOODY HAMMERS ( I love this band) - Riotgod - Asphyx - Deathbreath - Pungent Stench - Dodsgerd (great new album from these guys) - Forefathers (this is the one you guys should probably check out if any) - Khold - Bal Sagoth - Summoning - Einherjer - Nothgard - Asmegin - Borknagar - Doomsword - Grand Magus - Weedeater - Reverend Bizarre - Count Raven - Soltice - Isengard - Naglfar

Well those are the bands I finally got around to checking out this fortnight :) Let me know what you have :)"

"WHYBLT - What Have You Been Listening to - Idea from /r/Metal","**Whispered - Thousand Swords** ([Blade in the Snow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2M3G7wO1Yw)): Finnish ""Samurai metal"", a very interesting mix of traditional Japanese melodies and instruments juxtaposed with harsh vocals.  
  
**Tengger Cavalry - The Expedition** ([The Expedition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErGElmK380w)): Chinese folk metal, focusing on Mongol themes. Very cool stuff with top-notch throat singing.  
  
[**Jonne - Kuku Käki**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYiSWPrNbuc): Since this was posted on here a few weeks ago I haven't been able to get it out of my head. Such an awesome song, can't wait for a full album.

"WHYBLT - What Have You Been Listening to - Idea from /r/Metal","Various songs from the following have been swanning about in my playlists:

[**Chthonic**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5z-AOdCAx8) Not sure where this ranks on a scale of one to folk, but there are elements there at least. Also, is taiwanese.

[**Arkona**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7fuuDc2hH0) Russian folk metal, probably one of my favorite bands.

"WHYBLT - What Have You Been Listening to - Idea from /r/Metal","I honestly can't stop listening to Finsterforst latest album. It is folky, epic and very well produced. Especially when compared to their early stuff. "
"WHYBLT - What Have You Been Listening to - Idea from /r/Metal","Interesting picks OP- Lumsk and OTYG were the two bands that got me into folk metal and I hardly ever see them mentioned."
"WHYBLT - What Have You Been Listening to - Idea from /r/Metal","I am in love with Svartsot's Maledictus Eris, Krampus' Survival of the Fittest and Furor Gallico's self titled. Those to me are some of the best folk albums ever created. Every song is great and memorable!"

"[Jewish folk] Gevolt - Tshiribim Tshiribom (Official video)","Album came out in 2011, not exactly new.  I've known about this band for a couple years and just figured it was NDH and not Folk Metal.  Those two genres really evoke the same things for me, but not for everyone.  Early Letzte Instanz is also violin-heavy NDH that sounds folky.  There is a languishing /r/NDH, perhaps some of us here might be interested in."

"Blood &amp; Banjos - Free Debut Album","i'm glad we got that squared away :)"
"Blood &amp; Banjos - Free Debut Album","I'm sorry. I really wanted to like this. I love folk. I play banjo. I play mandolin. I love metal. I love folk metal. This is awful. It's unfortunate too because they are clearly talented musicians. The acoustic parts are great, but they married it with the worst parts of metal. Breakdowns and half assed screamo singing vocals. Damn it. I hate that I hate it. 

It's a terrible name too. It makes it a gimmick which sucks because the songs clearly have the time put into it. Why spend all the time writing songs and then make yourself a joke with that name and those song titles. Bummersville dudes."
"Blood &amp; Banjos - Free Debut Album","no need to apologize! this is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, especially people who love ""metal"" metal. and to be honest, the whole thing started as a joke (the band name came first) and the project was always rather tongue-in-cheek (a guy killing people with banjos? really?)  we never took ourselves too seriously, but we tried our best to produce something well-executed and polished..."
"Blood &amp; Banjos - Free Debut Album","you certainly accomplished the well-executed and polished. very clean and well constructed. I suppose I was hoping for more of a crust metal sound during the metal parts. Bleak and meaner, minor and downtuned. Like if Blackbird Raum had a baby with Requiem's Storm Heaven.

"What do you think of Arkona's new album Yav?","Yav has often been considered to be a classic ""grower"", so now that it's been out for a few months I'd love to hear your opinions on Arkona's new album. How do you feel about the direction the band is taking with their latest output? I've already heard different opinions about the changes, both positive and negative and some don't even see a change in sound and image at all. Imo Yav clearly shows more progressive and even (post) black metal-ish influences and less folk elements. I suppose some of you are familiar with their back catalogue, so I'm curious about what you think.

To anyone interested who hasn't been listening to Yav yet, here's a [link to the album on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWX1DO_rdTM).

I for my part love it and would consider Yav my absolute favorite album, for many different reasons - most importantly because it's a very personal and honest album, and I''ve always been a fan of their ""darker"" songs. Seriously, I could go on and on about it, but for now I'm just curious about r/folkmetal's opinion."
"What do you think of Arkona's new album Yav?","I absolutely love Yav. It's one of the few cases where the band calling an album ""serious"" isn't a nail in its coffin. If there was any change from Slovo to Yav then I think it was merely the band reaching the endpoint of a very long journey. With every single album they released, Arkona was becoming more and more progressive. Yav is just them committing to that for an entire album, and they released an amazing piece."
"What do you think of Arkona's new album Yav?","I agree - the way Masha's songwriting developed over the years is amazing and reached it's peak in complexity with Yav (so far). I heard she's already writing new songs, really curious about what's coming next - even if it'll take a while of course."
"What do you think of Arkona's new album Yav?","Masha is really on another level with her talent in singing, writing &amp; arranging. I do wish they brought Vedan Kolod into this album just because their voices together is really beautiful. Slovo is my favorite I think but I'm so happy Yav happened. I can't get enough. "

"Wuthering Heights - Dreamwalker part 1 (Power/Heavy Metal + Folk)","I love them but I much prefer the more recent albums (Far From The Madding Crowd —&gt; Salt) because the singer was replaced by Nils Patrik Johansson (Astral Doors).

"NOT saying this band is folk metal, but I'm curious what you folk metal fans think of this one specific Rotting Christ song","I dig it, I'd like to hear more bands with that sort of folk instrument. Greek, middle eastern ?

EDIT: Googled them &amp; they're Greek. I thought it sounded sort of Xena like. "
"NOT saying this band is folk metal, but I'm curious what you folk metal fans think of this one specific Rotting Christ song","Although in the link text I said ""this one specific"" song, actually the whole album this song is from, Aealo, has a lot of other songs that also have this sort of sound.  

To a lesser extent there is also the odd folk (IMO) element in one or two songs on albums before and after that one also, e.g. [Nemesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdWerqw0TYU) on Theogonia, [Cine Iubeste Si Lasa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTGUm_LEVB8) on Kata Ton Daimona Eaytoy.  

To me, this is interesting to share because I think many people would assume from the band's name + not having heard the music that the band is probably black metal, vs. not expecting them to have this kind of sound.

Re: ""that sort of folk instrument"": Personally I too would like to hear more of this instrumentation and/or female singing style.  But the only other example that comes right to my mind is from another Greek band, Preemptive Strike.  This band is NOT metal - they are industrial aggrotech - but some of their songs have ""ethnic"" sounds / progressions that strangely remind me of Rotting Christ.  Best examples are [TALOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RttZdk9kqp8) and [Hubris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sFGJ7nialY).  As an added bonus, they are still heavy (albeit not in a ""metal"" way) and are singing about Greek mythology in many cases.  I got a few of my buddies to listen to this band by calling them ""Rotting Christ: the dance remixes"" - LOL.

All somewhat tangential to ""actual"" folk metal, but I'm hoping some folks enjoy it nonetheless."

"What's your favourite song off of Sagas? (Or Erdentempel as well, if you want.)","Blut Im Auge has been my favorite since I discovered them (it was the first one I heard by them) but Uns'rer Flüten Klang, Heavy Chill or Wirtshaus Gaudi might replace it"

"What's your favourite song off of Sagas? (Or Erdentempel as well, if you want.)","I like so much off of Sagas, but I think my favorite has to be Die Weide und der Fluß. The way it transitions the entire album, and how it comes in from Heiderauche is just beautiful. I love the whole album, as many do, and early on I really like Wurzelbert, Blut Im Auge, and Unbesiegt, but there's just something about the tone of that song that haunts me, and I love it.

Erdentempel is also amazing, of course. I love the variety of the album (though Heavy Chill is sometimes just a little too off the rails for me, though I still like it), and how it brings back some of the folksiness that was lost on Rekreatur. I think my early favorites are Karawane, Uns'rer Floten Klang, and Apokalypse."

Sagas - Mana; Blut im Auge and Unbesiegt.

Rekreatur - In Heiligen Hallen and Der Ewige Sieg

Erdentempel - Every single song is amazing but my favourites are:  ~~Scratch that.~~  I began writing out the album track list.

I think Erdentempel is definitely on par (perhaps even ahead) of Sagas.  Every song is just so enjoyable and uplifting.  I have been listening to it non-stop for three weeks now.  Although Mana may be my favourite song of all, I think Erdentempel is the most consistently amazing.  

And then I read down the list on this thread and realised there are even more songs I love."
"What's your favourite song off of Sagas? (Or Erdentempel as well, if you want.)","For Sagas it has to be Verrat. The second half of the song is just pure perfection.

I like Erdentempel as a whole and for me Uns'rer Flüten Klang stands out as a very positive surprise. The only thing I'm disappointed about Erdentempel is that it doesn't have as epic instrumental to end the album as Mana and Kurzes Epos are."
"What's your favourite song off of Sagas? (Or Erdentempel as well, if you want.)","Heimwarts, Ruf in den wind, Unbesiegt and Blut im auge."
"What's your favourite song off of Sagas? (Or Erdentempel as well, if you want.)","Uns'rer Floten Klang is a brilliant song in my opinion, which is skewed because I myself play the flute.

Finntroll is pretty rad too, if you like Swedish.

Finntroll though. They're the band that got me into folk metal, and their inspiration from Emperor/Black metal made it better for me. They keep it interesting to say the least.

"Help with an amazing tune I found in two different songs- Can you ID it?","So I was listening to Eluveitie- The Arcane Dominion (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-hkjryDCmg) and all the sudden realized it is a tune from my childhood I loved, from the band Lothlorien, the song Dans En Dro (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T92Er46xkCo)


So this kind of blew my mind, is this awesome tune from somewhere else?"
"Help with an amazing tune I found in two different songs- Can you ID it?","I don't recognize it from elsewhere, but since Eluveitie takes a lot of material from existing folksongs, there are other examples of this crossover.  For example, [Inis Mona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iijKLHCQw5o) is [Tri Martolod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqeDDvUS0kU) with different lyrics."
"Help with an amazing tune I found in two different songs- Can you ID it?","Oh thats pretty sweet, thanks!"
"Help with an amazing tune I found in two different songs- Can you ID it?","Eluveitie makes use of a lot of tradition folk tunes in their songs.  Chrigel, the band's lead vocalist and songwriter, put together a list of some of the tunes that they used [here](http://forum.eluveitie.ch/viewtopic.php?p=43476&amp;highlight=#43476).

As you can see, the tune is known as En Dro (or An Dro) and it's an old Breton dance tune.   The name apparently means ""The Turn,"" which can be a little misleading because it can be used to describe a style of dance rather than the tune itself -- that means you'll probably find other tunes given the same name because they were used for the same style of dance.

Edit: Case in point: Eluveitie have a track called [Andro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfjtZMCu-ZE) on their first album.  Same name because it's the same type of dance, but a different source tune.

I found a few instances of other people performing their versions of this specific tune:

* [Robert Culbertson doing a cool arrangement of the tune on a Chapman Stick]  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTS2yF3ljwQ)

"Help with an amazing tune I found in two different songs- Can you ID it?","Sounds kind of like Rasputin"
"Help with an amazing tune I found in two different songs- Can you ID it?","I just wanted to add that beginning of this song [Blood Stain Child - Metropolice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQhRS-4NXiE) sounds  like beginning of [ELUVEITIE - A Rose For Epona](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z89WI96MzZc), pretty freaky. Maybe both bands used the same tradition folk tunes. Does anybody know if the intro of Epona is a traditional tune if yes which one is it."

"Help! Hunting for a new band","Ooh that's pretty sexy. Awesome instrumentation. Do they ever do unclean vocals? I've gotten to the point where I actually prefer screaming over singing lol"
"Help! Hunting for a new band","They occasionally have unclean vocals, but always to contrast with the clean lead vocals, and never for a full song.  "

"Help! Hunting for a new band","You might like Trollband. They have a somewhat blackened folk style.

Ifing leans somewhat toward atmospheric black, but still is great for folk metal.

Ymyrgar is not too bad either.

EDIT: By the way, I love the Elder Scrolls reference in the username."
"Help! Hunting for a new band","Trollband and Ymyrgar sound pretty good. Ifing sounds even better, I have actually been listening to more atmospheric stuff lately.

And thanks about the username. It's also a reference to the TV show Vikings which is awesome if you haven't seen it. And if you haven't had real life mead, you should work on fixing that ;)"

"Help! Hunting for a new band","Since you mentioned In Extremo, here's some related bands: Subway To Sally, Saltatio Mortis, Schandmaul.

Edit 2 not metal, but Faun. "
"Help! Hunting for a new band","Yep I know Subway to Sally and Schandmaul, forgot to mention them. I'll check out the other guys. Faun? Is that the term for that German style of metal?"
"Help! Hunting for a new band","Faun is a group that is more folk, not metal. Really great music though, I love them.

The sub-genre for the type of music that Faun, Subway To Sally, etc. is mitteralter. ""medieval"" 

I can't spell."
"Help! Hunting for a new band","Oh ok. I have to be in the mood for that subgenre. I like my folk metal usually with a hint of melodic death metal or atmospheric black metal. Suppose I should have put that in the actual post lol"
"Tyr - Grindavisan",""
"Tyr - Grindavisan","raised up as a reformed protestant, the chorus of this one always brings me in a ""Christmas"" spirit. it resembles so much to the psalms, but I honestly think it's because of the way they covered the chorus from the kvæði. 
"
"Tyr - Grindavisan","Grind is usually killed during summer though."
"Tyr - Grindavisan","well, it's not a bad one, though I was really appalled when I heard that they got signed by Metal Blade Records, fearing that their sound would change totally in a more ""hey, I sound like all the other ""folk"" metal bands out there""...but that's life, they have to make money somehow."
"Tyr - Grindavisan","The first time I listened through the album, this one didn't stand out at all.  Going back, I find that this is one of the few that really preserves the style and feeling of Tyr from albums like Land and Eric the Red.  If only the song were about 2 minutes longer it would probably be my favorite on Valkyrja."
"Tyr - Grindavisan","So I'm fairly new to the genre (heard Finntroll about a year ago). Tyr was one of the those bands that I never got around to listening to despite the endless recommendations. This was the first album I heard in full, I had heard Hold the Heathen Hammer High awhile back though. Now that I've made it through the whole discography, I get why people arent too into the newer stuff. Since the album was really the first I heard from them I absolutely love it. Another Fallen Brother is a kick ass song from that album.

Do you have any favorites from the old albums?
"
"Tyr - Grindavisan","All of my favorite songs are from their old albums!  Not just favorite Tyr songs, favorite songs.  There's Dreams and Regin Smidur, Ride to Hel and Wings of Time, Sinklars Visa and Lokka Tattur, to name a few of the best.  Their style really shifted over the albums.  The first one, How Far To Asgaard, sounds like proggy doom metal with traditional influences, and has a different singer.

My favorite is Eric the Red, some more good ones from that are Ramund Hin Unge and The Edge.  Ragnarok is a more progressive concept album, and Land is more focused on their Faroese roots.  By the Light of the Northern Star is where they start getting less progressive but in my mind is still an excellent album.  It has everything Lay of Thrym and Valkyrja have, without the power metal that gets in the way.

I still like new Tyr too, just not as much.  Another Fallen Brother and lady of the Slain are some of the best songs they've made in years."
"Tyr - Grindavisan","I feel like I could've written this exact post."
"Tyr - Grindavisan","It does feel like a popular opinion."
"Tyr - Grindavisan","Thanks. I'll start digging deeper into the old stuff. I have to say though... I fucking love power metal, so that's probably why I like the newer stuff a lot."
"Tyr - Grindavisan","Lol yeah, it's just a matter of taste.  My friend loves power metal and Valkyrja is his favorite Tyr.  I like power metal too, so I would love Valkyrja if I didn't expect it to be more like Ragnarok.  I think that's how most people in folk metal feel."
"Tyr - Grindavisan","I'm listening to Eric the Red right now. It's so proggy, I love it."
"Tyr - Grindavisan","Definitely my favorite song from Valkyrja. Overall I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the album; ranks a very solid 3rd right behind Ragnarok and Eric the Red. "

"ARKONA - Na strazhe novyh let (from Yav)","Napalm has out a ""sampler"" of each track. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQduhe36HeM)

One thing Masha said about the album is that it is more ""serious"" so there are no songs like Stenka na Stenku or Yarilo on it. No ""fun"" songs. It is about the separation from the material world. Being Siberian &amp; then being from Moscow I get what they mean."
"ARKONA - Na strazhe novyh let (from Yav)","I would agree with her assessment of the album.. I'm just curious how actual fans will find it.  I'm going to reserve judgment and listen to it a few more times.  Its definitely a departure though."
"ARKONA - Na strazhe novyh let (from Yav)","It has something of a progressive bend that caught me off guard. I've listened to it 5 times by now and will still need a few spins to let it sink in. "
"ARKONA - Na strazhe novyh let (from Yav)","Been listening to it non-stop since I got it and already had the chance to see new songs live a few times. Especially Yav' and Na Strazhe Novyh Let are incredibly powerful live songs! About the album - I love it's complexity. Every time I listen to a song, I discover new sound elements and structures. It might be difficult for fans of, say, Goi Rode Goi or Vo Slavu Velikim to get into it because of the many progressive parts and lack of folk elements, but I think the change of sound was an important step - and I know it wasn't easy for them. 
Imo Masha's songwriting grew and developed further with every release. Each song has it's very own character but they perfectly fit together on one album (that's what I missed a little on Slovo). This makes Yav almost a concept album and it's message is a very important one - so it's good they published English translations of the songs. I've always been a fan of their ""darker"" or more serious songs, so I really don't miss the ""fun"" ones. "
"ARKONA - Na strazhe novyh let (from Yav)","I preordered the boxset- mine came in almost a week ago now. It's quite different but pretty damn good."

Arkona released a compilation of their acoustic folk songs for free online, called Akustika. Drudkh has ""Songs of Grief and Solitude,"" but it is mainly the folk melodies from their metal songs, taken and made into folk songs. Ulver has that one folk album, Kveldssanger. 

Svarga has a folk album- [Krov'-Reka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSVYNZiWaYM), a live acoustic album- Vetry proschayut vsyo, and a few collaboration folk singles.

"EQUILIBRIUM Teaser for New Album ERDENTEMPEL","Erdentempel is out tomorrow in the EU and the 10th in the US. Rest of the world is somewhere in between I think."
"EQUILIBRIUM Teaser for New Album ERDENTEMPEL","I got Erdentempel already.. It's fucking amazing, probably one of their best albums. BIG BIG props to Equilibrium!"
"EQUILIBRIUM Teaser for New Album ERDENTEMPEL","Better than Sagas? wow, I'm even more excited now."
"EQUILIBRIUM Teaser for New Album ERDENTEMPEL","Mhm. Its their best album in terms of atmosphere and production. I'd definitely say ""Apokalypse"", ""Stein meiner Ahnen"" and ""Ankunft"" are the best songs on the album.  
Sagas is probably still my *favorite* album though because it was the first metal album I ever bought and some of the songs are just unbeatable. :P"
"EQUILIBRIUM Teaser for New Album ERDENTEMPEL","I'm still undecided if it's better than Sagas and Turis Fratyr, but it definitely better than Rekreatur."
"EQUILIBRIUM Teaser for New Album ERDENTEMPEL","I liked Rekreatur..."
"EQUILIBRIUM Teaser for New Album ERDENTEMPEL","It wasn't bad, of course, but in my opinion it was their weakest album, probably because it was straight after the switch from Helge."
"EQUILIBRIUM Teaser for New Album ERDENTEMPEL","Listened to it in the car this morning. It's alright and certainly better than Rekreatur as a whole but that's it, sadly. I feel like the big selling point of this album is 'Waldschrein', like 'Der Ewige Sieg' was for Rekreatur or 'Blut im Auge'/'Unbesiegt' on Sagas. And I feel it's quite a bit weaker than all three of those.  
'Stein meiner Ahnen' is quite nice, it has a Turis Fratyr vibe, at least lyrically.  
  
What I also noticed was, that the vocals are a lot further in the background than on their earlier albums. Not sure if that's something to do with Robse's style but I liked it better when the vocals had a more central role. (Liked Helge's vocals better as well.)  
  
Solid album altogether, just not worldshaking.
"
"EQUILIBRIUM Teaser for New Album ERDENTEMPEL","Did you notice that Waldschrein on this album is a bit different from on the [EP release](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjKJlKQ50wE)? It's mainly small tweaks, but the ending has been amped up a bit, in my opinion, and the vocals are further in the background like you said."
"EQUILIBRIUM Teaser for New Album ERDENTEMPEL","Nice, thanks for that, I hadn't listened to the EP. It feels like the album version is a blend of the EP version and the acoustic version also on the EP.  
While the album version feels more refined, the EP version is more fun to listen to, imo."
"EQUILIBRIUM Teaser for New Album ERDENTEMPEL","I pre-ordered the album after hearing the short clip of ""Uns'rer Flöten Klang"" from the track-by-track previews, and now that I've heard the full track it was 100% worth it for that alone.

I haven't gotten to listen to the rest of the album yet, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if Erdentempel is even better than Sagas.

Edit: oh, he's a racer. Interesting."
"EQUILIBRIUM Teaser for New Album ERDENTEMPEL","He's been in a coma after a serious brain injury at the end of last year. He may never come out of it, and if he does, he will probably need to re-learn how to speak and feed himself."

"What Eluveitie song uses this riff?

In fact, when I saw Eluveitie play live at Hellfest 2011 (Metal festival in France) they kind of apologized to the crowd before playing Inis Mona because it's such a blatant rip-off of ""Tri Martolod"", a classic Brittany tune (the french region, not Britain).
My Irish friend who plays Trad can name several of the other songs they use for their material.

Don't worry, they aren't the only ones who do it and it's [not limited](http://youtu.be/JdxkVQy7QLM) to Folk metal either.

Found all of their stuff on Spotify. The arrangements are bit crude, for better or worse. The vocals will take some getting used to but this is the first Middle Eastern-themed folk metal I think I've heard, at least as far as I can remember unless Salem counts.

If anyone has similar recommendations, I'd love to know."
"Al-Namrood - Atba'a Al-Namrood/أتباع النمرود (Saudi Arabia)","Check out [Melechesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeIa9gGMJg8). They're an Israeli band who also fuses black metal with middle-eastern folk instrumentation very well.

Also, though they're more staight death metal, [Lykathea Aflame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF6AazbybME) is a band that has some strong middle-eastern style melodies as well."
"Al-Namrood - Atba'a Al-Namrood/أتباع النمرود (Saudi Arabia)","I was wandering around youtube today and stumbled across a band called Seeds of Iblis who is apparently part of an ""Arabic Anti-Islamic Legion"" or some such thing involving 3 or 4 other black metal bands.  Most of it seemed even less listenable than this though, both re: arrangements and re: recording quality (I know it is not ""cool"" to complain about recording quality with black metal, but still).  Too bad because I would LOVE to find a black metal band who carries on about Iblis the same way the European guys carry on about Satan - sadly my tastes are more toward the symphonic end than the lo-fi end and I haven't found anything that really grips me yet on that front.

Way less heavy than all of the above, there's also [Orphaned Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG213nX6cto).  I find them a lot more interesting to listen to than the more black-metal-leaning stuff from the region that I've encountered so far... Melechesh being a prime exception, i.e. I agree with the other poster on that front re: they're very good."
"Al-Namrood - Atba'a Al-Namrood/أتباع النمرود (Saudi Arabia)","It starts off good, progresses a bit unexpectedly, but I'm still jammin.. Them it transitioned to the vocals, and well, I wasn't on board after that. Other than that, they have potential. Instead of building up to generic metal, they should build up to better desert metal. "
"Al-Namrood - Atba'a Al-Namrood/أتباع النمرود (Saudi Arabia)","I wonder how they get around their extremely restrictive government. With a name that apparently means ""Non-Believer"", I can only imagine they have the tread lightly."
"Al-Namrood - Atba'a Al-Namrood/أتباع النمرود (Saudi Arabia)","Sorry for the necro, I was just looking around for more info on this band. Anyway, Al-Namrood doesn't necessarily equate ""non-believer"", it's basically Nimrod in Arabic which I suppose is open to interpretation as to how it's meant as a name.

Their record company however, is called ""Shaytan Productions"" literally meaning Satan's production. That's a name they wouldn't get away with in Saudi-Arabia."

Skipped the show this time around (was in LA seeing my buddies in Nekrogoblikon) and DNA is, as usual, hit or miss. Some bands have sounded great there recently (Metsatoll comes to mind) but others have had poor mixing and have been way too loud for no reason, making everything sound muddy."

Were you wearing ear plugs?  They don't block everything equally and my experience with DNA Lounge is that the sound is usually mixed to sound good for people with ear plugs, which results in it sounding like shit (and being way too loud) for people without. Never been on the balcony for a performance, though."

"A lesser known yet epic song. Kivimetsän Druidi- Tuoppien Nostelulaulu","I have their ""Shadowheart"" album and I was pretty underwhelmed and disappointed with it.  This song is a lot better, but I felt the Shadowheart album had very weak instrumental melodies which were too predictable and overall just not that interesting.

I also feel that the mix was rather terrible (I guess that can be slightly forgiven as a first release) but also that the female vocalist overall detracted from the music.  It's good to hear she's improved, as on the Shadowheart album she was frequently missing the note and singing flat when large vocal leaps were required.  Of course this is all comes with experience, but Kivimetsan Druidi pretty much fell off my radar due to a weak first album.  

Good to see them improving."

"Silly Finntroll controversies","So I saw Finntroll last November (3rd time for me) and have heard local folk metal fans voicing some interesting opinions about them since that most recent show.  It made me curious what folks on here think about...

**1) The most recent album**

A lot of Finntroll fans I know either hate it, or hate both it and the one before it, but are not very good at articulating why.  ""Too avant-garde"" and ""too steampunk"" are both comments I have heard, specifically re: Blodsvept.  And I am not sure how either of those descriptors actually translate into sound.

Personally, I like all their albums.  My only complaint is, as someone who favors black metal and its accompanying aesthetic, I liked the song topics of the old albums better (i.e. slaughtering ov Christians!), but that in no way prevents me from still appreciating the newer albums for being what they are.  

So what do folks on here think re: how the band's music/lyrics/aesthetic have changed over time?  Like, did they at some point cross some instrumental threshold for you from ""silly"" to ""too silly""?  Do you have an opinion about the lyrics or have you never cared to translate them? etc.

**2) The pointy ears**

I've noticed an amusing gender-based trend in my local scene re: reactions to the whole ""wearing pointy ears on stage"" (as per this most recent tour) thing:

**Male fans:** *(other than me)* Reaction typically entails such elements as:

- Says they look stupid

- Makes derogatory remark about live role-players and/or Vulcans

- Complains about how the ears are detrimental to anyone taking folk metal seriously as a genre (METAL = SERIOUS BUSINESS)

- [Something homophobic]

**Female fans:** by contrast...

- Thinks the ears are cute (especially if the girl in question owns a cat)

- Appreciates ""the effort"" of dressing up to play a show

- Is probably wearing pointy ears at the show herself

- Fantasizes about being forced to spin wool and scratch Vreth's head, because trolls

Made me curious what folks on here think about the ears.  Personally I'm with the local ladies about appreciating the effort (there's my black metal influence showing itself again probably) but not massively surprised at the ""funny ears are a threat to my *Viking manliness!""* reaction of some of the guys + feel sorry for them if they let a show/band's music be ruined for them by something like that.  Thoughts and opinions?

EDIT: because I super-fail at list formatting.

EDIT #2: I just wanted to clarify, re: ""black metal,"" I meant to provide background on what aspect of *my* tastes cause me to prefer certain lyrics/looks/etc., not to assert that *Finntroll* belongs to that genre.  Sorry if that was not clear.  Also wanted to reiterate that I personally am both pro-recent-albums and pro-pointy-ears, and am very pleased re: responses so far to see that most folks on here are apparently NOT of the mindset of certain metalheads I know IRL who take themselves way too seriously."
"Silly Finntroll controversies","I personally fucking love Blodsvept. It's got a lot of great folksy, polka influence. I mean, I appreciate the whole black metal appeal but as someone who is primarily a folk/thrash/power fan, it definitely appeals to me for different reasons.

But the ears are somehow making it hard to take people seriously? Are we forgetting that people do not take corpsepaint seriously? Or that the whole idea of Satanism, trolls, death, etc. aren't taken seriously outside of metal? There's no way the ears are going to be the one thing that will stop people from taking *polka metal* seriously. It's something that you either appreciate or don't- it may grow on you but it's never gonna grow on you if you don't give a shot, you know?

Plus, the ears are part of the stage show. From Behemoth's aesthetics to Maiden's antics, it's all very showman-y. The ears are simply part of putting on the show and I'm not sure how that would detract from the music they play.

Metal tends to be pretty divisive already. Some people are going to hate anything that makes it look like the band cares more about appearance than the music, which I can understand. However, I think if they cared about appearance over music, they wouldn't be playing polka metal. I think the ears are pretty cool and the effort to put on a full-fledged show is always appreciated by me."
"Silly Finntroll controversies","&gt; Some people are going to hate anything that makes it look like the band cares more about appearance than the music

Agreed, and IMHO those people are idiots. They seem to think a band isn't able to do two things well, or that having an image that doesn't come from lyrics or interviews will somehow compromise their music."
"Silly Finntroll controversies","I love Blodsvept. Maybe not quite as much as some of their older albums but it's still a really good album.

As for the ears. When did they start doing that? I haven't seen them play live for a couple of years now so it might have happened since the last time but I've never noticed them/"
"Silly Finntroll controversies","I could be wrong, but I am strongly under the impression that they started doing it on the most recent tour.  Pretty sure as well that Vreth's coat in addition to the ears = same as in the video for Haxbrygd.  ""Let's make the best use of awesome props we used in a music video and wear that get-up on stage too"" = a principle I approve of, as it seems to me it's working well for Behemoth these days also."
"Silly Finntroll controversies","Guess that's why I've not noticed it then. I haven't seen them play for a few years now."
"Silly Finntroll controversies","I haven't heard the new album yet; thanks for reminding me. Going to give it a listen today. Yeah, I know, ultra-fail; I guess I forgot about it :(

As for the ears, meh, I (male) like them."
"Silly Finntroll controversies","The ears go well with the rest of their costume. I liked it. I wish i had pictures of that show :("
"Silly Finntroll controversies","honestly, whatever i think the new album is rad,  i pre-ordered with with a shirt + cd bundle. 

I love the ears and everything, any band that is willing to have cool costumes that corresponded with their music is swell in my books

do not give a fuck what some butthurt fan is saying.

if you like it, awesome. if you don't like, it cool

no one needs to make a huge discussion about this, the band will decide to do whatever they want regardless and it is their decision. "
"Silly Finntroll controversies","Male here, I don't give a flying fuck about the ears. Finntroll is still awesome so the ears don't mean shit to me. "
"Silly Finntroll controversies","I thought the ears are funny and oddly cute in a way, too (male, n-no homo..), but I don't think they detract from their stage presence.

The whole steampunk thing with Blodsvept made me a bit confused at first, but I'm not really complaining, still sounds like Finntroll and I love it. It's a lot more ""playful"" in a way than Nifelvind, in my opinion, but I think that goes well with their style of folk music."
"Silly Finntroll controversies","Honestly, I like the pagentry of folk metal, it only adds to the experience, especially at shows. There isn't a band that takes the stage that isn't concerned with image, *especially* the ones that try to convince you otherwise. 

I didn't hate the steam punk, but I like the older aesthetics they've gone back too. If for no other reason it'll help keep the hipster crowd at bay. "
"Silly Finntroll controversies","I thought Niflevind and Blodsvept were by far their best.  They were never  ""black metal"" and you can tell in their latest album that it's still Finntroll, playing the same music, but with new ideas.

I personally love Blodsvept and think it's another great album like their previous ones.  

The ears might seem silly, but who cares?  It doesn't affect their sound at all.  The reason I love Finntroll is their music and that's how it should always be.  If you let image dictate what you listen to, you're going to miss out on a lot of good music and that's just a pity."
"Silly Finntroll controversies","I like all their albums, but i don't like their latest as much as the rest, still like it though. I don't like it as much because I feel it is more guitar first and orientated and other instruments later, the guitar is louder than the other instruments in the album most of the time, and feels like it is the melody line."
"Silly Finntroll controversies","I love all of Finntroll's albums, but I thought Blodsvept was exceptionally good.  I appreciated how fun and upbeat it was; it stands out from the darker stuff I normally listen to.  

The ears are just part of the image they're going for, and I don't see why anyone would get butthurt about it.  Finntroll is a troll-obsessed band; if anything it should come as a surprise that it took this long for them to dress up like that."
"Silly Finntroll controversies","Who cares? The way I see it, they probably just wanted to have a bit of fun and thought it was would be funny. "
"Silly Finntroll controversies","The pointy ears seemed kinda silly to me tbh, that's not just a male thing.  That said, I don't really mind silly things all *that* much, so I'm neutral about it."

"R.I.P Krampus :S","I was already disappointed with One For Sorrow when they adopted prominent use of clean vocals, that quite frankly weren't good and were not necessary. 

And with their more recent music in general, the lyrics are far less interesting but are now simplistic and more soppy, nowhere near as poetic and deep as in their old music. The melodies too aren't anywhere near as refined and beautiful as they used to be and simply the clean vocals do not add anything but cheapen the music. "

"TURISAS - Ten More Miles (OFFICIAL VIDEO)",""
"TURISAS - Ten More Miles (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Despite Turisas2013 being one of the shittest album titles I've ever seen (must've been hard to come up with the name...) the album itself is very good and enjoyable to listen to.

Despite the fandom surrounding Battle Metal; Turisas' first two albums had a lot of hit and miss in my opinion.   The good songs were amazing, but there was a lot of ""meh"" in between.  Stand Up and Fight really marked an improvement in the song writing and arrangements.  That was their first album I enjoyed from beginning to end.  

While people dislike the wandering from the ""Viking"" path, the new songs are very good.  However visually it's quite an odd combination for a bunch of face-painted warriors to be singing about modern issues like ""Fear the Fear.""  The only downside I've heard so far in the new album is the fucking weird sex section of ""Run Bhang-Eater, Run!""  You can be certain I won't be playing that song through my speakers at home... "
"TURISAS - Ten More Miles (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","...I have never seen Mathias without facepaint on.  This was a very strange experience."
"TURISAS - Ten More Miles (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","I am stuck off the coast of bloody Nigeria and the album is out. Raging. Hoping that I can get enough Internet to download it."
"TURISAS - Ten More Miles (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","i can't wait for their album to be dropped stateside :D "

"Looking for something like Eluveitie's clean-vocal songs.","I do really like Eluveitie's style, but I'm not a fan of screaming as anything more than a small accent to a song, I prefer clean vocals, and I'm a sucker for a strong female lead. I'm also a frequent listener to Power Metal and Symphonic Metal (Blind Guardian, Sonata Arctica, Nightwish, Avantasia, Symphony X, etc.) if that helps.

Songs I like:

*Omnos*, *Brictom*, *Slania's Song*, and I just heard their new one *The Call of the Mountain*.

Can anyone recommend me something else along those lines? Or just more generally folk metal with clean vocals? Its hard to search when you don't know what you're looking for.
"
"Looking for something like Eluveitie's clean-vocal songs.","Check out Battlelore.  They combine female and male vocals, but their later albums have a strong focus on the female voice.  

Two good examples:

[Buccaneer's Inn (Sorry for weird game footage; no one has uploaded the album version of the song)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufoy2NXAIDQ)

[Sons of Riddermark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THLQt8kNiX0)

Their *Sword's Song* album is really good, but there are some great songs on their later albums too.  


If you enjoy folk music that isn't metal, I'd recommend checking out Faun.  They use a lot of folk instruments and have lovely female vocals.

[Mit Dem Wind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSxmfNS3NiY)

Hope this helps.  I think I have very similar musical tastes to you :)"
"Looking for something like Eluveitie's clean-vocal songs.","I cannot echo Battlelore enough. They do a good job of balancing their music, the vocals, especially. Plus, a good deal of their material is based on Tolkienian lore. Narn i Chîn Húrin is my favorite legend of his, probably in all modern fiction, and I was delighted when I found *Doombound*  (a concept album centering on the tale)...so, yeah, good suggestion!!

*""Master of Doom, by Doom mastered.""*"
"Looking for something like Eluveitie's clean-vocal songs.","I was just going to say Faun! Go listen to Schrei es in die Winde. You'll recognize part of it immediately.

Also, listen to Faun's earlier stuff, their former singer Elisabeth Pawelke is great! (She has her own solo stuff since she left Faun. Also plays hurdy gurdy. Check out El Rey de Francia. Not folk metal but still awesome.)


Suidakra has a song entirely sung by a woman called Birog's Oath. I'm not sure about the rest of their songs.


Forget any spelling errors, I just woke up. And I'm out of the serious folk metal loop, sorry for lack of that. I listen to more faun and ""medieval"" stuff. 


P.s. check out Anna's music outside of Eluveitie. Her voice is amazing."
"Looking for something like Eluveitie's clean-vocal songs.","I was actually listening to Faun's ""Von den Elben"" album on the way to work today, and this was the first thing I thought of seeing the OPs question.  I love the more upbeat Faun songs, but I get a little tired of the slower ballads...especially in the morning on the way to work."
"Looking for something like Eluveitie's clean-vocal songs.","Oh yeah, the ballads are very slow. Von den Elben  is a great album. I sometimes nod off on the ballads when I'm at my house and super exhausted. I don't drive but I have to look out for my bus stop."
"Looking for something like Eluveitie's clean-vocal songs.","They're not quite as heavy, but I like everything I've heard from Grai.

This likely won't be much help, but http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Eluveitie/13991?showMoreSimilar=1#Similar_artists is one way to find more bands. However, it's hard to tell what the vocal quality is from that list. While I wish I could recommend [Arkona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaP1wDvkA6E) to you the majority of Masha Scream's singing is the *opposite* of what you want (that is the only clean song I could find, and I'm not sure it qualifies). 

I'll recommend [Turisas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFBIr3Vx16w) to you; they fit what you're looking for besides the fact that it's a male singer. 

You may have luck dropping the ""metal"" and going for straight folk to find clean vocals with themes like Eluveitie. For example [Baltimore Consort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1z7kLzpRVA) does very traditional songs with an amazing female lead, Custer LaRue. (She hasn't sung for them for a while, I don't know who is singing for them now, but there's 5-6 CDs released with her on them. Many of the songs don't have vocals unfortunately). 

There's a lot of Celtic Folk singers that may also have what you're looking for. [Random example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDdi6bn06bo). 

"
"Looking for something like Eluveitie's clean-vocal songs.","Yeah, Arkona are excellent but mostly harsh.  About opposite of that is Dalriada (used to be Echo of Dalriada).  Female fronted, but mostly clean with some harsh.  Check out:

* [Napisten Hava](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wFlohv_VBo)

"Looking for something like Eluveitie's clean-vocal songs.","shes definitely one of my favorite female vocalists in folk metal, sadly theres only those few songs :("
"Looking for something like Eluveitie's clean-vocal songs.","I definitely second the recommendation of Dalriada, they're a great band with a really great and unique vocalist.  Arany-album is a good place to start.

I would also recommend Cruachan- they switch between a male and a female vocalist as well, and they're pretty similar to Eluveitie overall.

"Jaldaboath - Seek The Grail, live at the Lodge","Jaldaboath are brilliant. I've been following James Fogarty (Grand Master Jaldaboath)'s musical career like a huge nerd ever since hearing [this track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRMfTz1_j6U) from Ewigkeit's *Radio Ixtlan* on an Earache sampler, during his brief brush with the fringes of the mainstream. The man is an absolute nutter in the best sense of the word, and everything he's done (Early Meads of Asphodel, Ewigkeit, Blacksmoke, Old Forest, The Bombs of Enduring Freedom, Feral Underclass, Jaldaboath etc.) is brilliant and very strange. Especially when you consider that a lot of his stuff was just produced by himself in his flat. It's good to see he seems to be finally getting some recognition; I saw a few people at Wacken this year in Jaldaboath shirts (I myself occasionally sport a limited edition 'Axe Wielding Nuns' shirt)."

"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?",""
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?"," Eluveitie was the first Folk Metal band I found and are still my favorite. This will be the first new release since I started listening so I am super excited. "
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","Definitely am. I just hope that after Helvetios they won't got back to the Gallic wars... They've kind of overdid that subject. Amazing band though, I can't wait until Origins.  "
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","Well I think part of it is that the Gallic Wars are one thing that we have a lot of surviving material on, and it's a huge part of Gallic history. We have less so in regards to culture and religion, as the Druids regarded the written word as a tool for the weak of mind when it came to the Druidic duties, and so never recorded anything about themselves."
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","My most anticipated album of the near next to Devin Townsend's new one."
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","It's definitely in my Top 5-10 anticipated albums this year. 

Can't wait to see them live again - Elu and Friends III last december was awesome."
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","I guess that means a TOUR. Hope they come to my town."
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","I got a ticket to see them on the 11/11, can't wait!

Got two other things planned just before it, those few days will be fucking sublime."
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","I would have been but Erdentempel was too good for me to have room :P"
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","I am listening to Eluveitie from last 4 years. I am really excited about their album. Besides, there's always a story in all their albums, so don't just listen them because they sound good. Understand. "
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","Eluveitie SHOULD be a band that I absolutely love, but they aren't and I still don't know why.  I enjoy their music and have three of their albums, but it still doesn't really do it for me.  

My favourite Eluveitie songs are the ones with the female vocals as I feel they suit the music the most.  ""Inis Mona"" is probably the exception.  

I'll eventually get the new album but I'm not ""hyped"" for it.  I actually really want to enjoy Eluveitie as I love the folk instruments they use, but they are just one of those bands for me that you try to like a lot but just never seem to excite you.  

EDIT: Just listened to ""King"" from the new album.  Yep.  Still doesn't do anything for me.  It just sounds so similar to their other material.  I mean, in some ways you want to hear something familiar as that's why you like a band, but sometimes it's just too similar.  Just doesn't sound like anything new.  Hard to judge an album from one song though.  Who knows, the rest could be amazing."
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","Maybe it's because they've been my favorite band for so long, but I personally think every album has a very distinct sound. Their guitar work, while not incredibly impressive has been getting alot more interesting over each album. My only complaint was that it seemed like they were using a little less folk on each release, but from the sound of King and the couple live songs I heard from Origins, this one will have the folk I've been missing."
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","Out of curiosity do you like dark tranquillity? if you don't that might be why. Eluveitie has always been a melodic death metal band that interjects folk instruments and stylings. They don't really approach songwriting like a pure folk band (Evocation is the exception here because its a folk album with no electric instruments)"
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","I think that's part of the problem.  I don't think the metal parts are that interesting and the male vocals are not appealing to me.  I love harsh vocals but his can sound really lame at times.  

I really love melodic metal.  My favourite folk bans are Finntroll, Equilibrium and Moonsorrow among others.  I've just never been convinced by the melodies of Eluveitie.  Some are really good, but I feel that once you've heard one, you've heard them all.  

I do however love the folk parts of their songs and as I mentioned I think the female vocals (like in ""Slainia's Song"") are far more appropriate and interesting.  

"
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","So basically you don't like melodic death metal, fair enough."
"So who's excited for Eluveitie's new album?","Except I do... I enjoy older COB, Kalmah, Amon Amarth etc.  Oh well, thanks for your responses.  

I should make it clear that out of all the folk metal bands, I still consider Eluvietie a great band, just not one of my favourites. :)"

We simply did not have a good opportunity this year to offer you a good billing.

I think that is because of the low bit rate. I think they uploaded lower quality because album is immediately going to be on torrent sites, so if you want nice quality you got to buy a cd, or wait for someone to buy it and leak it in high quality."

"Turisas - Take The Day!","Awesome band, love it. It's a shame the last album switched to a more rock vibe and seemed overall unfinished and experimental, they could have achieved more by sticking with their badass viking roots."
"Turisas - Take The Day!","The problem is that people want to pigeonhole certain bands into a specific genre and when that doesn't happen they complain that they are not the same band.  Turisas2013 is amazing, despite a stupid album title.  Some songs sound like they could be on earlier albums while some songs strive to be different.  My personal favorite is ""We Ride Together""  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeeCUmcHKYw "
"Turisas - Take The Day!","I personally think it just generally sucks. Just not the kind of music I want to hear. I mean if they like it whatever but I'll keep listening to their old stuff. "
"Turisas - Take The Day!","The varangian way is still their best so far, every track is excellent on it. Stand up and fight had some great tracks but Turisas2013 had very few. Only Greek Fire and Piece by Piece IMO were good."
"Turisas - Take The Day!","Man, I love the Turisas so much. I have to listen to at least one track on Stand Up and Fight a day. 

I've seen many comments like yours since their latest came out, and it has made me extremely apprehensive in regards to listening it. Is it really THAT me. 

EDIT:  A day. "
"Turisas - Take The Day!","I really enjoyed it. People seem to be turned off to it because it's a little less heavy and doesn't take itself seriously at all compared to their last album. They were just having fun and it shows. 

Definitely different from their older stuff, but I have no complaints with a band trying something a bit new."
"Turisas - Take The Day!","It's not that it's awful, but to me there is a right time and place for everything. Coming from a band where the viking theme is central to some of their best songs the Turisas2013 album just seems underwhelming. 

I suppose my main problem with it is that they don't choose a clear direction. If they want to take their viking roots to a higher level this album fails to do so on all account. If on the other side this is an experimental attempt to get over the swords and face paint viking image (which is something I can totally respect) it still comes short because it lacks any unifying structure. Certain songs can equally well be labelled as power, symphonic or death metal, while others are (in my opinion fairly weak) rock songs. There is no theme, no structure, nothing that ties the album together and solidifies it as the next big step in Turisas metal music. 

Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate some of the songs in their own right, maybe even as an album in it's own right, but listening to it there's just very little of what made Turisas ""Turisas"" for me. But mostly I'm really curious where they will take any future albums. I think both a rebirth of the viking stuff or a better refinement of these new directions could work, it's all up to them. "
"Turisas - Take The Day!","Thanks for articulating this position so well. Usually when I see people bashing this album, they don't give very good reasons. Can totally respect and see where you're coming from. Still, I really enjoyed the album as a whole."

"Khalas - Alf Leila (Palestine)","From their Bio: 

Khalas origniated from the new Arabic and Oriental scene that is currently emerging in the Middle East. The Palestinian band inoculates sensual Arabic beats and lyrics with aggressive metal riffs. Bread on various musical moods, such as AC/DC, System of a down, Black Sabbath, etc… and stars from the Arab world: Muhammad Abdelwahab, Om Kolthum and Asmahan. The band composes original sounds while getting strong insipration from the classical Arabic repertoire all of which ruthlessly embedded with Rock and Metal arrangements.

"The song that got me into metal. Eluveitie-Your Gaulish War","Switzerland. 

I think what he means by Scandinavian metal is due to the sound of the music. A lot of people also categorize folk metal  as viking metal (Ensiferum, eluveitue, etc) and vikings were from Scandinavian. It's still a first time for me hearing that expression . :-) "

Seeing Moonsorrow tonight for first time, last in a string of awesome folk metal bands to come through my homecity of Brisbane, Australia, this year.

Have seen Eluveitie, Kvelertak, Korpiklaani in the last few months (plus Russian Circles and a few others, but different genre).

If someone told me Solstafir and Skalmold were touring through Oz soon I might die from too much good music.

So damn pumped."

"Bands similar to Týr?","I'm new to the genre and I was wondering what bands out there have similar style to Týr? I really like their power metal-like aspect and also their melodic aspect. They also have a lack of ""screaming"" (don't know the right term) in their metal music so it almost seems like its not metal sometimes."
"Bands similar to Týr?","**heidevolk** is another folk metal band that sings instead of screaming"
"Bands similar to Týr?","+1 for Heidevolk. Just a note: all their songs are in Dutch"
"Bands similar to Týr?","Nederland Saksenland!"
"Bands similar to Týr?","Thank you on the heidevolk suggestion. I'd actually apparently heard one of their songs in some mix somewhere."
"Bands similar to Týr?","I get you on being able to understand the lyrics. I'm not a big fan of unintelligible vocals either, but I've been able to make some exceptions. These are a couple of my recommendations for you to explore, but none of them are *exactly* like Týr, so you get to have some fun exploring.

**Equilibrium:** Folk metal with a driving pace. These guys do a fair bit of growling, but it's great stuff. I wasn't into them that much until I heard their latest album, **Erdentempel**, which I loved. I recommend beginning with that one.

**Sabaton:** Power Metal, nothing folky about them. They sing about World War 2 and many other conflicts. Clean vocals, driving pace, and heavy, militant, drumming. Great Power Metal. Again, I wasn't really too into them until recently. I recommend both their latest album, **Heroes**, and **Carolous Rex**. Both are great. I listened to Carolous Rex twice this past Tuesday.

I'd start there. Everything I recommended is available on Spotify for starters. I could go on a bit, but I feel I'd be getting farther from Týr and just start naming bands I like.

EDIT: Ooh, almost forgot; **Turisas**! Power metal with a little bit of folk thrown in. Mostly intelligible lyrics and melodic. They've got a great cover of [Rasputin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdkBs0VCSX0), and I would recommend starting with **Battle Metal**"
"Bands similar to Týr?","I don't have anything else to suggest, but I completely back up everything you've suggested. It's hard for me to find bands similar to Tyr to recommend. I saw them last August at the Granada in Dallas, and honestly I was impressed at the presence they had for a four piece. I don't know why, but I always assumed there were more than four of them."
"Bands similar to Týr?","Fully backing Turisas and Equilibrium here. Equilibrium's album ""Sagas"" is also fantastic."
"Bands similar to Týr?","I was introduced to Equilibrium when a friend played Mana for me. What a song!"
"Bands similar to Týr?","They really don't have a bad song, IMO. Probably my favorite German metal band right now."
"Bands similar to Týr?","Eh, there's some ""meh"" songs on Erdentempel, but other than that I definitely agree with you. I also saw them live twice last year and it was a blast :)"
"Bands similar to Týr?","*HELJAREYGA*!!! A couple members of Tyr are in the band, including vocalist.

[Heljareyga - Heljareyga](http://youtu.be/7T73hBjO-D8)

"Bands similar to Týr?","Holy Jeebus, thank you. As a fan of Tyr, I thank you for introducing me."

"Bands similar to Týr?","I see Triddana/Skiltron is finally starting to get popular on this sub. Nice."
"Bands similar to Týr?","Stille Volk is one of my favorite bands. However they're not metal in any way. Still worth checking out though. "
"Bands similar to Týr?","You're right, I just listed a couple of folk bands that have clean vocals. I am often forgetting they're not even metal :O"
"Bands similar to Týr?","Turisas, Sabaton, have already been mentioned but I can't give enough upvotes so I'm going to say them again ;)

Falconer is solid. 

Actually pretty much anything off of [this list](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/T%C3%BDr/14435). (er... if it doesn't link properly, the ""similar artists"" tab). 

Maybe also Wintersun?

I think Ensiferum and Finntroll are pretty similar to Tyr, but not in vocal quality which seems to be what you're looking for.

"
"Bands similar to Týr?","I'm definitely going to double up on Falconer and Turisas, they're awesome. Turisas does growls a bunch, but they've always got clean vocals to balance it out.

Falconer always has exclusively clean vocals and sings a ton in Swedish. They do more power than folk, but they've got a particularly folky album that is all in Swedish, *Armod*. They're more along the lines of Valkyrja and The Lay of Thrym than any of the older Tyr material, though (that is to say, more power-y with only a hint of folk in the melodies)"
"Bands similar to Týr?","Try In Extremo. Great german folk metal band, if the german lyrics don't bother you. "
"Bands similar to Týr?","I will second Sabaton, Turisas, and Falconer, and add in Alestorm."
"Bands similar to Týr?","Just to be clear, it doesn't have to be in English. I actually somewhat prefer hearing folk metal music sung in native tongues. Especially very minority native tongues (like Tyr with their Faroese)."
"Bands similar to Týr?","I've been digging Metsatöll since seeing them with Eluveitie and Tyr last year. Pretty sure it's exclusively in Estonian but the singer's voice is really awesome."
"Bands similar to Týr?","Try Troll Gnet El. They're a Russian folk metal band without any real growling. "
"Bands similar to Týr?","try Bucovina, a romanian folk metal band, they mostly incorporate clean vocals in their song with just the occasional growl, they are the closest thing to Tyr i can come up with off the top of my head.

"Bands similar to Týr?","There are a [few](http://www.reddit.com/r/folkmetal/comments/15uhgr/folk_metal_with_clean_vocals/) [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/folkmetal/comments/2c75hy/nonscreaminggrowling_folk_metal/) [about](http://www.reddit.com/r/folkmetal/comments/1cscom/brothers_of_metal_i_require_aid/) [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/folkmetal/comments/14pmip/looking_for_some_new_powerfolkthrashy_metal_bands/) on this sub already.  What you are looking for is clean vocals as opposed to harsh vocals.  Týr are also somewhat [progressive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_metal), especially their older albums, which may also be something you are looking for."
"Bands similar to Týr?","Skyforger (from Lithuania) has some very similar songs, structurally, to older Týr (i.e. - if you like things like Sinklars Visa, you'd appreciate some of Skyforger's songs).

On the other hand, Skyforger can get into the super extreme range (growling/screaming, etc.) that would be completely divergent from Týr, so it's really hit or miss.

That's about as similar as I can find. Been listening to Týr since 2003 and haven't found anything close enough except for, of course, Heljareyga and bits and pieces of Skyforger.


EDIT: Like [this](http://youtu.be/A0e2L2_BAvo) is probably what you're looking for. It's similar to Sinklars Visa, just a little more. . .'boring'(?) if that makes sense. "
"Bands similar to Týr?","Album version is much better quality (album name is Bannkreis), but:

[Subway to Sally - Das Rätsel (Live 1997)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwr0O5XqnC8)

Here also is [Liebeszauber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9oPgn8X1fI) from the album recording."
"Bands similar to Týr?"," Eluveitie ! Start with the album Helvetios. Such good stuff. Saw them live, the lead singer had a fuckin quiver full of different flutes. One of the best shows I've ever been to. "
"Bands similar to Týr?","Triddana, korpiklaani (lots of Finnish songs), turisas, heidevolk (Dutch), glittertind (Swedish).

If youre interested I will reply more tomorrow."
"Bands similar to Týr?","Mago de Oz are folk metal with a Spanish flair. Not the same as Tyr, persay, but similar in that they deviate from some folk metal stereotypes."
"Bands similar to Týr?","Korpiklaani is a little more on the folk end of the spectrum, but I find myself listening to them as well as Tyr (and, like everyone else, I second Turisas)."
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","What are you guys' thoughts on Eluveitie's new album?"
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","It was a pretty good album. Not sure if I liked it better than Helvetios, but it was fantastic and one of my favorites of 2014 still."

"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","I know they at least did french at a couple shows in Canada. Only because when people cheered for her to do it French, she said she just did it in French a couple nights ago in Montreal."
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","Sexy. Fuckin' Sexy"
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","Yes! I've seen the Italian version in Treviso and the Swiss one in Prague two days ago. They let the audience decide on whether they want the English or a different version, and apparently so far they never got to play the English one on the European tour :D I don't know what it is, but that song really got me, especially in Schwitzerdütsch... they should do more songs in that language. "
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","I really enjoyed and still do rock out to this album. Definitely on par with their quality of music. Especially considering how good Helvetios was. From Darkness is my personal favorite on the album but there weren't any songs I disliked which is best case scenario for an album. I just wish their would been one more track with female vocals and harsh vocals backing. Such an amazing mix I.e. Alessia 
Ensiferum has a new ablum coming out too early next year. "

"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","I really can't get into their music... I feel like their style is pretty stagnant in that their music is pretty predictable.

As I've said many times, they are basically a band I *should* theoretically like but don't.   

I know this subreddit loves them, but they really do nothing for me.  "
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","Yesterday I didn't even know Folk Metal existed, today it's my favorite genre of music thanks to this album."
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","Welcome! \m/ Eluveitie was my first introduction into folk metal (and a gateway to most other metal as well), though I started with Evocation."
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","Fan-fucking-tastic.  Only downside for me was a too many spoken word tracks/sections.  Still, definitely the best album of 2014."
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","I'm honestly surprised at how much I enjoyed (am still enjoying) it. I'm not the biggest Eluveitie fan, but 'Helvetios' is probably one of my top 5 albums *ever*. Across all genres.

This album is a hell of a follow-up to what I consider an almost perfect album."
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","I think it's their best overall album. Helvetios had stronger standout songs--I'd even accept that Slania did too, but their sound has matured a lot since then--but nothing else they've put out has stayed so consistently good from beginning to end. I've listened to it regularly since it came out.



From Darkness, Virinus, and Call of the Mountains are the best tracks.


"
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","Not to be a bummer, but it is my least favorite album by them. I love listening to individual songs by them shuffled with other artists. When I saw them live this year it was the most disappointing concert I have been to. They performed exceptionally, but track after track from Origins made it quite repetitive. Overall I'd say its an alright album, but their techniques they use in their metal songs are too repetitive.

TL;DR Alright album that is pretty much the same as their others.  "
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","Is it metal or acoustic? Because these days I only ever really listen to Ven or Evocation. There metal stuff is getting too practiced and formulaic. Fantastic as a gateway band to folk metal from those who like general paint-by-numbers metal but I just can't get enthused about it. Every album is more of the same but with less spirit and originality each time."
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","No idea why you're getting down voted... I personally think your opinion is spot on.  

As I've already posted, I find their music predictable and their ideas far too similar to many of their other songs.  

I kind of hoped that a small sub reddit like this was beyond downvoting opinions when they said something critical about a band they liked..."
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","I hoped so too, but whatever. Everybody was so all over this I thought it was worth posting an opposing view to provide some contrast. I used to be all over Eluveitie too, I preordered the Slania LP and wore the hoodie to bits (holes in the elbows... takes some doing) But slowly I just kept going back to the quiet stuff and if I wanted a blast of angry then Ven fills the spot without going on for too long.


I'm just waiting for Evocation 2. When that happens I will be camping outside the record stores door to grab a copy."
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","I see what you're saying, but you don't have to be such a dick about it."
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","Dude asked for opinions, I gave mine. I can see why people are raving about them with each new release but it is for the same reasons generally that I can't stand listening to them anymore."
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","Loved it. One of my favourite albums of all time"
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","I've listened to it in its entirety multiple times.  Can't get enough of it.  It's possibly my favorite album by them, second only to Evocation I - The Arcane Dominion.  Just a great album, no complaints."
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","Loved it. I think it's their best album since Slania. My personal favorite song is The Silver Sister."
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","My favorite album of the year.  The guitar intro for Sucellos is phenomenal. "
"Eluveitie's ""Origins""","I'm so in love with King and The Silver Sister. King is my favorite track in the album though; it's been on repeat since I first listened to it!"

"""medieval rock"" band Feuerschwanz. I'm not sure understanding German would help me understand the video, but I like the music.","First of all - Feuerschwanz means firedick. Just thought id let you know that.

Here is the best translation I could come up with. It doesnt seem like this song makes a ton of sense. Also, from the accents, Im not entirely sure this band actually speaks German as a first language.

In Geschichten und Sagen

Geht es heiß her.

Deshalb braucht man einen starken

Durstlöscher!


In tales and stories

It is a stormy affair 

That’s why you need a strong

Drink! (literally thirst-quencher)




Hoch in den Bergen

Bei Elfen und auch Zwergen:

Betrug und Hypokrisie,

Davor keiner warnte sie.



High in the mountains

Near elves and also dwarfs

Deception and hypocrisy

You have not been forewarned.




Metnotstand im Märchenland!

Der Durst verbrennt mich heiß wie Feuer!

Metnotstand im Märchenland!

Die Brüder Grimm bezahlen teuer.

Metnotstand im Märchenland!

Herr Gevatter reicht die Hand, es ist:

Metnotstand im MÄrchenland!



Metnotstand in the fairy-tale-land *

The thirst burns me like hot fire!

Metnotstand in the fairy-tale-land *

The brothers grimm pay poorly (literally ‘pay cheap’)

Metnotstand in the fairy-tale-land *

Mr Gevatter is fed up with the hand, it is (possibly like the ‘hand he was dealt in life’)

Metnotstand in the fairy-tale-land *




Spekulanten aus fernen Landen

Den Methandel profitabel fanden.

Das Märchenland zusammenhält

Ist nun mal nicht alles Geld der Welt.



Adventuring in foreign lands

He finds the mead trade profitable

The fairy-tail-land cannot be kept together

By all the gold in the world (the cannot is actually in this line)




Der Teufel mit drei goldenen Haaren

Will sofort was zu saufen haben.

Hans im Glück ist depressiv.

Denn der Geist im Glas ist kein Aperitif!!!



The Devil, with 3 golden Hairs,

Wants to drink immediately,

Hans in happiness is depressed 
(that is a literally translation, No idea what the fuck it means.)
Then the ghost in the glass is not an appetizer. (Normally I would translate this to spirit but that could be misconstrued in this sentence as a distilled drink, which I am fairly certain is not what is being said, even though that would make more sense.)




*I think metnotstand might mean hangover. Met means mead, not means hardship/need/distress and stand means rank/position/status



EDIT: I tried to format this to make it readable, but reddit said fuck you.

EDIT 2: slightly improved translation

EDIT 3: okay, so notstand means emergency, which makes sense. So I guess the song is called mead emergency in fairytail land.

EDIT 4: So to explain the video, it looks like they are in a fairytail land where all the fairy tail creatures are fighting over the very last bottle of mead in fairytail land.

I like seeing them side by side, so I just [ran it through google translate](https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/In%20Geschichten%20und%20Sagen%0AGeht%20es%20hei%C3%9F%20her.%0ADeshalb%20braucht%20man%20einen%20starken%0ADurstl%C3%B6scher!%0A%0AHoch%20in%20den%20Bergen%0ABei%20Elfen%20und%20auch%20Zwergen%3A%0ABetrug%20und%20Hypokrisie%2C%0ADavor%20keiner%20warnte%20sie.%0A%0AMetnotstand%20im%20M%C3%A4rchenland!%0ADer%20Durst%20verbrennt%20mich%20hei%C3%9F%20wie%20Feuer!%0AMetnotstand%20im%20M%C3%A4rchenland!%0ADie%20Br%C3%BCder%20Grimm%20bezahlen%20teuer.%0AMetnotstand%20im%20M%C3%A4rchenland!%0AHerr%20Gevatter%20reicht%20die%20Hand%2C%20es%20ist%3A%0AMetnotstand%20im%20M%C3%84rchenland!%0A%0ASpekulanten%20aus%20fernen%20Landen%0ADen%20Methandel%20profitabel%20fanden.%0ADas%20M%C3%A4rchenland%20zusammenh%C3%A4lt%0AIst%20nun%20mal%20nicht%20alles%20Geld%20der%20Welt.%0A%0ADer%20Teufel%20mit%20drei%20goldenen%20Haaren%0AWill%20sofort%20was%20zu%20saufen%20haben.%0AHans%20im%20Gl%C3%BCck%20ist%20depressiv.%0ADenn%20der%20Geist%20im%20Glas%20ist%20kein%20Aperitif!!!). It comes out pretty close but of course your grammar is much better. 

Double space at the end of the line, then enter  
makes a line break. 

Double enter at the end of a line

makes a paragraph break. 

That should help you format it so it's more readable. 

Edit: Glück can also mean luck, so perhaps ""Hans im Glück"" means ""lucky Hans""? [Here we go, discussion thread](http://dict.leo.org/forum/viewUnsolvedquery.php?idThread=822478&amp;idForum=1&amp;lang=de&amp;lp=ende). That is exactly what it means and it is the title of another fairy tale. 

More edits: The band is definitely German, but they're from SouthEastern Germany so the accent is different from what is taught in school, at least here in the US.

I thought I learnded German until I crossed the bridge over the Rhein, where the people had a so different accent that I couldn't understand anymore :) 

(Seriously, it's not as strong as what I said, but there is still a lot of people with strong accent, when I hear people from northern Germany sounds like they are dutch, and when I hear people from Bavaria it sounds like they are illegal migrant from hungary, and I don't talk about the Swiss ) :p

"It's not the Turisas I first fell in love with. But I can't not like it.","I think if you are particularly attached to the first two albums, the later two aren't going to be your cup of tea.  

I personally think their last two are their best as I felt the first two were a mixed bag and weren't consistently strong.  

I actually really like ""For Your Own Good"" as it has a really catchy chorus with some great chord progressions.  The worst song is really only ""Run Bhang-Eater, run"" because it has some stupid sex section in the middle relegating it to the ""never play in public"" list.  If you start playing that song out loud, chances are everyone is going to think your watching porn.  "
"It's not the Turisas I first fell in love with. But I can't not like it.","Exactly. I discovered them right around the time the Varangian Way came out. That's one of my favorite albums ever and I definitely think change is good but I wanted more of that kind of sound from Stand Up and Fight."

"Trollband - Canadian Blackened Folk Metal","Greetings humans...
I'm here to promote my project ""Trollband""
We've been around since 2007 and have played some pretty choice shows...

http://www.Facebook.com/Trollbandhordes

Part of my Reaching out to reddit and /r/Folkmetal in specific is to promote a show that we are co-headlining in Edmonton Alberta on February 21st, 
What makes this show special is that it would be our first attempt to stream it live over the internet...
On top of us we are playing with 3 other very wonderful and capable bands of Folk and Black metal influence...

https://www.facebook.com/events/229859173854042/ - here is the link to the event 

AND here are the direct links to the other 3 bands...

Ides of Winter - https://www.facebook.com/idesofwinter

Mongol - https://www.facebook.com/MongolCanada

Skymir - https://www.facebook.com/skymir

When it comes to music, exposure and spread to fans and friends is far more important to us then profiteering off of album sales and crowd-funding.

So with that said, for taking the time to read this rather disheveled message...
I present to you for your listening pleasure,
Our first 2 albums free to download at no cost
@ http://www.Trollband.bandcamp.com

Thank you for your time

Probably my joint favourite band right now alongside their countrymen Mael Mordha. The state of my panties if they were to tour together. (Throw in Cruachan or Waylander too for good measure)"

"Read my review of Primordial's latest album ""Where Greater Man Have Fallen"" in Music&amp;Riots latest issue","They challenge those boundaries by being one of the only folk metal bands not to adhere to the notion that folk metal has to be cheery."
"Read my review of Primordial's latest album ""Where Greater Man Have Fallen"" in Music&amp;Riots latest issue","I can think of a bunch of not-cheery folk metal bands. Amon Amarth, Moonsorrow, old Tyr, Thyrfing..."
"Read my review of Primordial's latest album ""Where Greater Man Have Fallen"" in Music&amp;Riots latest issue","One between many, and quite frankly, of all those Primordial are the ones that truly change more often.

Amon Amarth, i love them, but they are cheery, they are battle folk whatever and they make the blood pump. Moonsorrow have their own gimmick, but their hardly dark and innovative, Tyr dance between the line of cheery and hard, and i do agree, they tend to be more progressive than other folk bands, just not as challenging as Primordial and Thyrfing are quite, quite boring and generic.

Comparing the recent works of all these with Primordial... Primordial come out on top. They're darker, more serious and musically they are more daring than all of those."
"Read my review of Primordial's latest album ""Where Greater Man Have Fallen"" in Music&amp;Riots latest issue","Honestly... it's more just that the ""cheery"" ones also happen to be the most popular/well known. I'd even wager to say that most folk metal bands are unlike the ""party metal"" of a lot of Alestorm/Korpiklaani/what have you (even if a good chunk/most fall more to the ""cheery"" side).

I could name quite a non-cheery ones- although probably not as dark as Primordial... but they're still not nearly so light-hearded as just singing about booze and victory. Also at the same time, Primordial is pretty light on the ""folk."" "
"Read my review of Primordial's latest album ""Where Greater Man Have Fallen"" in Music&amp;Riots latest issue","What i think of this album is that Primordial are folk, they are darker than most folk bands with equal stature and they experiment more with their sound. They have riffs that resemble classic doom in this work, but they keep them in a folk metal setting. That is the difference between them and all the other. While many bands aim to break away from the mold of traditional folk metal, they truly don't achieve it. Primordial with this album were able to create a folk setting where their black metal influences and traditional doom sounds were not completely displaced. That is what makes them different, that is what enables them to break the boundaries of the cheery folk metal that so many bands of equal stature can't seem to shake."

"What are the absolute best more obscure folk metal bands out there?","I listened to Bathory a few years back, and I know a few songs by Old Corpse Road, but other than that, I've got a buttload of folk metal to listening to do."
"What are the absolute best more obscure folk metal bands out there?","Vintersorg is really good. I dont agree with all of the bands in that list, but most are at least worth knowing if not listening to regularly."
"What are the absolute best more obscure folk metal bands out there?","Now I know I'm officially far too deep down in the Folk metal pit when I know and love most of the ""obscure"" bands...

Summoning is probably one of my favourite bands of all time.  I'd also check out [Caladan Brood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py6iHvKbDjs) if you enjoy Summoning."
"What are the absolute best more obscure folk metal bands out there?","Came here to mention Otyg and Forefather! Great bands. I've not listened to Otyg in a few years but if memory serves they can be weird. A good way to get a sense of them is to check out their cover of Holy Diver. 

Also Waylander is a little more obscure I would say. "
"What are the absolute best more obscure folk metal bands out there?","We should compile a list of bands like this, putting yours and /u/HandsomeDynamite's lists together and adding more.  Both of you included great bands, but you both left out Skalmold, Dalriada, Irminsul, and Heri Joensen's Heljareyga."
"What are the absolute best more obscure folk metal bands out there?","I put Dalriada in as an afterthought, I don't really like their sound so I left them out at first."

It's a project of Ihsahn, so I don't know how obscure that makes it, but it is way more mature sounding (ie less silly) than most of the folk metal I've heard.

Not sure if it'd normally be considered Folk Metal, but it's as folk as plenty of the suggestions here. It's all sung in Irish too, so that's worth some folk points. It's their first album and it's a real cracker. Definitly one of my favourites this year. "

"ALESTORM - Drink (New Song)","Damn, this is really good. Alestorm is actually growing as a (semi) novelty band, which is very rare. Kudos."
"ALESTORM - Drink (New Song)","I suspect they wouldn't even be considered a novelty if there were more pirate bands.  Viking metal would be a novelty if Amon Amarth was the only band that did it.

Alestorm is still reeeaaally gimmicky though, and that's ok."
"ALESTORM - Drink (New Song)","Thanks for showing me amon amarth. Got anymore like this? I fucking love songs that tell stories (ballads). "
"ALESTORM - Drink (New Song)","If you want similar to Amon Amarth check out King of Asgard.  Ensiferum has some similarities, but they're most folky.  Most Viking metal bands tell stories, although not all of them are ballads.  Amon Amarth has some great ballad/stories, namely Last With Pagan Blood, Where Silent Gods Stand Guard, Warriors of the North, Embrace of the Endless Ociean, Prediction of Warfare, and my favorite, Thousand Years of Oppression."
"ALESTORM - Drink (New Song)","It's kind of made OK by the fact that they know their entire act and music is gimmicky.  

The melodies in this song could easily transition into anyone of their drinking songs and the lyrics are unoriginal by the bands own admission, but they know this.  It's just so damn fun and you know it's going to be cheesy and stupid-in-a-fun-way.  

Just look at Chris Bowe's side project, Gloryhammer.  He is spreading the cheese from pirates to medieval battles.  
I think this verse from ""Scraping the Barrel"" sums it all up:



Many have told us that we can't go on

That one day we'll run out of lyrics for songs

But when the time comes to write album four

We'll scrape out the barrel once more"
"ALESTORM - Drink (New Song)","Gloryhammer is way cheesier than Alestorm, but the concept is somewhat more original.  There isn't too much mythological-Scottish-highland-wizard power metal around."
"ALESTORM - Drink (New Song)","Fun song / video.

Then I followed the link to [RUSSKAJA - ENERGIA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVWfqOSdzs4) and I don't even."
"ALESTORM - Drink (New Song)","That song. I just.... I can't."
"ALESTORM - Drink (New Song)","That second verse had me guffawing more than any song has ever made me before."
"ALESTORM - Drink (New Song)","Even if the chorus doesn't have a deep meaning, I think it sounds really awesome. Also cool to hear a couple of names of their other songs to be used in the lyrics.

"American Pagan Metal band Helsott needs help funding their debut album.","I saw them open for Turisas at the Key Club in Hollywood, and they totally held their own.  It was one of those shows where at about the second song you turn to your friend and go ""wait... who is this again?!"" pretty much in awe because what they brought was not what you expected from a local band. 
Unlike most domestic folk/pagan metal bands they don't come across as '*pretending*' to be a folk/pagan metal band, if that makes sense.  I think it's tough for US bands like them to not feel like a parody, or disingenuous.  They certainly have a real deal vibe to em."
"American Pagan Metal band Helsott needs help funding their debut album.","Yeah, that's exactly why I dropped the pagan aspect in my band.  It would have just been tacky, unless we managed to do it just right."

"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","They're been on my top 3 since I saw them live. That was before I even listened to any of their songs. "
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","I would love to see them live!"
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","I'm curious... I love this album and evidently so does everyone else :D but it seems to be some what of a consensus that it's a bit asian sounding? Though it doesn't sound asian to me I'd be curious for timestamps of these asian-sounding bits :D"
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","Check out [this video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl6CmmerR8c) You get to hear a lot of the individual tracks to Sons of Winter and Stars, there are definitely a few Asian elements in there. 

Also, if you're curious, I believe the reason you are being downvoted is because Wintersun isn't really considered folk metal. I personally think it fits here as it is very folk-like, but not many agree.

Edit: Video was taken down, replaced the link with one that works."
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","what would you call wintersun?"
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","Melodic death metal."
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","Interesting! I am relatively new to the metal world, so please forgive my dumb questions. I'm I guess familiar with symphonic black metal (people like Dimmu Borgir) and can understand the difference in vocal style between Wintersun and Dimmu but are there other factors? 

I am often miscategorizing bands and would love to get better at it so I can not only discuss them intelligently but also find new bands :). I often will look at metalarchives.com but never thought to for Wintersun and, sure enough, they agree with you :)."
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","Because of the vocals? Stylistically it's almost nothing like death metal, besides the vocals, which are more in line with black metal if anything.

I'd describe Wintersun as progressive power metal with harsh vocals."
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","I'd say it depends a lot on which album you're talking about. I do think the cover a lot of sub-genres though and I don't really think of them as a **pure** death metal."

"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","would blind guardian also be considered melodic death metal?"
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","No, Blind Guardian is a power metal band."
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","Finally got home and had a chance to listen to a few songs, I agree completely."
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","I have no idea, I don't have access to Youtube or any streaming media here at work so I couldn't say without hearing them. If you want to call them folk metal then fine, call them that if you wish. Nobody will agree with you, but that's your decision."
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","Melodic Power Folk Symphonic Neo-Classical Death Progressive Metal, which is utterly ridiculous so I just refer to them as ""Awesome."""
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","You left out Majestic! =P"
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_metal Evidently Wikipedia thinks they're folk metal and metal archives thinks they're Melodic Death Metal http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Wintersun/22813 lol. I would take the later as a better reference but I think it's telling that Wikipedia also was misinformed."
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","&gt; I think it's telling that Wikipedia also was misinformed.

On their page they are listed as melodic death metal, power metal, and folk metal. I'd say they are close enough to folk metal to deserve a mention, they just sort of skirt the line. Sort of like Ensiferum. Then again I suppose it really depends on who you ask and which album you're talking about because the two out now are pretty different from each other. Anyways, this is one of those instances where Wikipedia may be *technically* wrong but can't really be faulted for it, a lot of people do feel they are folk metal, or at least really close.

"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","I can see that for sure. Their first album is great too but Time is one of my all-time favorite albums and was from the moment I pressed play ;).

"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","Also, I can cope with downvotes ;) I'm not here for karma and figured people who hadn't heard it might enjoy it. :D"
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","He used a lot of the Asian instruments in the east west quantum leap RA library.  Things like shamisen, koto, and erhu.  There are also a lot of Japanese melodies based on some pentatonic scales.  A big influence for the album is the sound track from ""crouching tiger hidden dragon"""
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","Interesting! I didn't know that :) Thanks!"
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","You are welcome!  I use the same library, its pretty fantastic!  It's pretty astounding how much work Jari put into the articulations of each instrument to give them such a dynamic tone"
"Wintersun - Time I (see comments)","It's really remarkable. Until fairly recently (maybe 6 or so months ago) I had no idea at all the sheer amount of talent and effort and skill many metal musician have in so many areas of making music. It's astounding :). "

"Your favorite folk metal bands?","That is so cool, I wish that I had been into folk metal a few months ago, I just found the genre!"
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","What country are you in? You are still lucky for living in Europe if you like folk metal!"
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","I am in America so I am out of luck. Also I am broke lol"
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","Nobody said Heathen Foray, :("

In no particular order :-) "
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","Svartsot is awesome"
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","If you are ever getting a chance to see them live, do it. A friend and I saw them, great energy and the leadsinger was headbanging together with the audience (he literally stood down with us). 

But we weren't more than 20-30 people at that concert. "
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","Dammit, I want to see them so bad, but I have a feeling they won't make it to the states (especially my part) for a really really long time, if ever."
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","You can be lucky. I am a Dane (just like them) and they don't play that often here either :-\ "
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","Maybe I'll just have to go to Denmark! But, I have been wanting to make it over to Europe (probably not for awhile, though) for a badass festival. Maybe by then, they'll be playing in one. I can only hope, at least."

"Your favorite folk metal bands?","Metsatoll, Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklanni. I just recently discovered this type of music, so I will be listening to all these bands today."
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","Faun and Dunkelschoen. EDIT: I know neither of them are particularly metal-y but on the folk side of things they're stellar. "
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","Korpiklaani, Heidevolk, Heathen Foray, Ensiferum, Eluveitie."
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","Moonsorrow, but also the highly underappreciated Finsterforst."
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","not much to add to whats here already.  I have been enjoying northland a lot lately though. "
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","Ensiferum, Heidevolk, Svartsot, Tyr, Turisas

I'd also never heard of Netherfell until reading OP's list, but holy shit they're amazing."
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","Oh wow, no Idea where to begin... okay, my number one is Arkona, followed by Drudkh and Finsterforst. Heathen Foray also make it to the top (although I have to admit that I'm a little biased because the vocalist is a friend of mine - everyone should check out his other up and coming band Alphayn, they are currently working on their first album!) as well as Eluveitie, Equilibrium and Kroda."
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","1. SKYCLAD (No one else comes close to their greatness)
2. Tyr
3. Elvenking

"Your favorite folk metal bands?","Heidevolk, Natural Spirit, Alkonost, Arkona, Folkstone, Menhir, Yggdrasil, Moonsorrow, Finsterforst"
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","Beer Bear"
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","Everything folk begins and ends with Otyg.  Nothing else really matters.

Jealous runners-up include Månegarm, Svartsot, Finntroll, Finsterforst, and early Vintersorg (before he went all cosmic and trippy). "
"Your favorite folk metal bands?","My mistake.  All the johnny-come-latelies don't approve."
"Looking for Spaghetti Western-ish stuff","I was listening to the new Ensiferum album and then [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjeWql0H_0g) played.

Admittedly my favorite song in the album, and its not even metal. I have a bit of a soft spot for spaghetti western stuff in metal I guess. Anybody have any suggestions for more similar stuff I can check out?

EDIT: I don't know if anybody else is interested, but I did find another spaghetti western metal band that hasn't been mentioned yet. [Their name is Redwest.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQFCUgzfbO4)"
"Looking for Spaghetti Western-ish stuff","Don't know if it's [perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgPweF3-DY), but it's pretty spaghetti western-ish and fantastic IMO"
"Looking for Spaghetti Western-ish stuff","This is fantastic. Such an ambitious and well-executed concept album. It's hard to believe that's the same Broderick Smith narrating as [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broderick_Smith). Sounds just like David Carradine, unreal it's the same as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MxllxOjHWs) soft-spoken Australian guy. Brilliant work. "
"Looking for Spaghetti Western-ish stuff","Closest thing I can think of would be another song of theirs, [Stone Cold Metal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO4QqaoFuso)"
"Looking for Spaghetti Western-ish stuff","Came here for this. Was not disappointed. Gotta love that banjo solo."
"Looking for Spaghetti Western-ish stuff","Absolutely one of my favorites of their new stuff. (Probably my top favorite, next to Smoking Ruins)"
"Looking for Spaghetti Western-ish stuff","Desperadoz is a band all about that.

Staying with Ensiferum, I think Ferrum Aeternum is a Enio Morricone  tribute song of some sort."
"Looking for Spaghetti Western-ish stuff","The game [Outlaws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ1_-Kcjcg0) has alot of cool western style music."
"Looking for Spaghetti Western-ish stuff","Maybe you would enjoy Clutch"
"Looking for Spaghetti Western-ish stuff","Totally not metal, but a similar feel for all that - [Apache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhIs1k8yuPU) by The Shadows (it's a surf-rock piece, but it's not as spastic as most of the genre).

For a slower piece - [Big Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkyPFhZHfhg) by Two Steps from Hell."
"Looking for Spaghetti Western-ish stuff","Check out genres like gothic americana, gothic country, and deathcountry. Some of my favorite bands in those are [Slackeye Slim](https://slackeyeslim.bandcamp.com/track/dont-touch-my-horse-2010-version), [Those Poor Bastards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326WpN3wMUo), and [Sons of Perdition](http://sonsofperdition.bandcamp.com/track/the-legend-of-saw-jones).  "
"Looking for Spaghetti Western-ish stuff","I remember Sabaton saying that the main melody of their song [To Hell and Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfur_S06CwA) was a sort of a tribute to Ennio Morricone."
"Looking for Spaghetti Western-ish stuff","I was seriously thinking the exact same thing after listening to this song. I couldn't tell you that I would enjoy this style of music if you asked me yesterday. It's probably one of the most warmest and most heartfelt in my mind. Beautiful."

"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Anything similar to Korpiklaani? I like Finntroll and Ensiferum etc, but I love the clean vocals more. What are some other bands that don't scream/growl in their songs?"
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Heidevolk, maybe?"
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Can't recommend Heidevolk more, great band, amazing sync between the two singers produces a really cool deep yet clean sound."
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Tyr is one that comes to mind."
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","I thought Tyr was a quote unquote ""screamo"" band.

"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Holy shit, I've been missing out. Thanks :D"
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Not at all. Very clean vocally."
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Wut."
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","That's a very funny impression to have."
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","I don't know why I did."
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","What everyone else said, but also... harsh vocals aren't typically referred to as ""screamo.""  Screamo stems from Scream + Emo, Emo having very emotional lyrics and not always neatly in one genre or the other, it's more a lyrical content descriptor.  Contrast [a folk metal song with harsh vocals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FP_yFIvQgo) with what Wikipedia tells me is [a Screamo song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqS5Fo9j7BA).  I don't think you deserve the downvotes for what appears to be an honest mistake.  Hope you like Týr as they are my absolute favorite band!"
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","'Tis why i said ""quote unquote."""
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","On top of the other suggestions, I really like Metsatöll. A lot of people who I've shown them to complain about the vocals because they aren't auto-tuned or anything, but I think it makes the music sound more real. "

"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","I'm surprised nobody has mentioned Elvenking here. "
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Elvenking seems to me like it's midway between power metal and folk metal, they're great but I don't know if they're strictly folk metal. I could be entirely wrong, this is just based off of what they sound like."
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","[Falkenbach](http://youtu.be/UoX9-mjo5is)

Glittertind (not as folk as eg. Korpiklaani)"
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","My god, Asa is a glorious album. Probably one of the best albums of all time."
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Otyg.  For me, Folk Metal begins and ends with Otyg.  It might be a little dated for all the kids and Johnny-come-latelies (their albums are from 1998-1999), but it doesn't get any better than those Swedes.  Early Vintersorg (from 2000 and earlier) is great too, and shares some band members, but they may or may not appeal to you as the vocals are more varied.

Storm's Nordavind (1995) and Cruachan's Folk-lore (2002) should also meet your requirements, and please your ears."
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Otyg ... OTYG"
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Otyg? OTYG??"
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Turisas and Korpiklaani are obvious examples, although their vocals are a bit gravely."

"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","I can't quite remember the clean/growled ratio, But [Cruachan](http://youtu.be/pdpevqjI_M4) Have some cleanliness on offer."
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Check out Skiltron. They also get bonus points because the singer sounds like Dio."
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","I'm glad I'm not the only one that hears that"
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Definite bonus, there.
"
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","There are lots of German bands that only use clean vocals. Bands like In Extremo, Subway to Sally, Saltatio Mortis, Letzte Instanz, etc."
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","So, I'll ask again since it came up.  Do Mittelalter metal and Mittelalter rock (c'mon, Letzte Instanz isn't quite metal, but still wonderful) belong here or on a different sub?"
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Never thought I'd see Saltatio Mortis here, I'm not sure how to describe them but they're fun to listen to (what are they singing about overall? Help?) I recommend Subway To Sally and Faun too. (I wish I could find decent translations of songs,  I want to understand what they are singing about!)

Edit words"
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Yeah, I don't know exactly how to classify them. They seemed somewhat relevant though. 

Regarding Subway To Sally song translations, google gave me this: http://lyricstranslate.com/en/subway-sally-lyrics.html 

I haven't used the site, my German is good enough to read lyrics, so I don't know how accurate it is."
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","I saw those translations... I was wondering on accuracy though too, it felt like some didn't make sense. (Maybe it's me, no clue because I don't know much German.)"
"Non-Screaming/Growling Folk Metal?","Elvenking, Týr. I know Eluvietie has some songs with ""clean"" vocals, but I haven't listened to all their stuff, so maybe they have an album of all clean vocals? I'm not sure"

* [Skadika](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFYoMrzeJ4)
* [Tuatha de Danann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4xG3sXiuo8) and the new band with many of the same members - [Tray of Gift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2snzrX9wTc4).

* [Тролль Гнет Ель/Troll' Gnet El'/Troll Bends Fir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iG2qF0JvvM) This song actually features Jonne from Korpiklaani!


**Both clean and harsh**

* [Ásmegin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA84ds3cxxg)
* [Myrkgrav](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G25ZWp7C7yA) and it's really just this one epic, fucking glorious song.  And it has some harsh vocals.  The rest are all harsh vocals.


**Acoustic albums from bands that don't otherwise fit**

* [Månegarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lx4wHT8JjQ) - The whole Urminnes Hävd album
* [Skyforger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z31khR-E2PU) - The whole Zobena Dziesma album


And, apropos of nothing, [Gevolt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i04pQR4ICPs) uses clean vocals and has violins here and there.  Not really folk metal, though somewhat folky.

"Help me delve deeper","I'm an 18 year old metalhead from England, I've been listening to metal since I was around 10 years old. 

I found metal through my sister introducing me to this mysterious folk metal band known as finntroll. I used folk metal as my gateway and so moved on fairly quickly to discover power metal, black metal, more traditional bands and thrash metal. 

Some of my favourite folk metal bands are, Ensiferum, Finntroll, Korpiklaani, turisas and alestorm. The problem is, is that there are many bands I listen to just a couple of songs of. These are bands that I discovered when I was very young and so did not have the mind/patience to develop my interest in these bands. That's what i'm looking to do now.

I need to know where to start actually getting to KNOW these bands and not just the hits.

Bands I need help with:

Eluveitie

Falkenbach

Agalloch

Arkona

Amorphis (Kind of)

Cruachan

Equilibrium

Heidevolk

Primordial

Svartsot

Tyr


I need to know where to start with these bands, which albums are essential? What should I know about them? Is there a specific order I should get to know them in?

I greatly appreciate any help, thank you very much."
"Help me delve deeper","I guess I'm a little late to the party but I'll recommend Dalriada, Skalmold, Irminsul, Metsatoll and Heljareyga.  Dalriada sounds like Eluveities but is (IMO) better, and older.  Skalmold is like Amon Amarth infused with Icelandic folk, Iriminsul is a really underground folk death band from Sweden I found in the Metal Archives on random band search, Metsatoll is an Estonian group that sounds pretty unique and has a great show, and Heljareyga is the prog-folk-power side project of Tyr's Heri Joensen.

Sorry I'd give some links but I'm in a hurry now."
"Help me delve deeper","With Tyr you can't go wrong with
[Hold the Heathen Hammer High](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu2bgwcv43o)"
"Help me delve deeper","I absolutely love primordials two recent albums to the nameless dead and redemption at the puritan's hand. 
Also check out darkest era if you like those two albums "
"Help me delve deeper","Thank you, I will give them two a listen :)"
"Help me delve deeper","I think for Heidevolk the best song they've made is probably [Het Wilde Heer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fPpDhdu_54) followed by [Reuzenmacht](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRN9NpYHz1c), these songs feel so powerful, partially due to the strong vocals.

They've also got some great instrumental ones: [Alvermans Wraak](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daTaOJwCG3o), [Dageraad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V5wtSzH2HA)

As for the best album, I'd have to go with Walhalla Wacht, almost exclusively great songs. Batava, their latest album is sounding too much like regular standard metal for my tastes."
"Help me delve deeper","Thanks, i'm not really an instrumental kind of guy, but i'll give the other two a look :)"
"Help me delve deeper","Definitely the more popular bands of those (so maybe better to start with?) are Eluveitie, Arkona, Agalloch, Tyr and maybe Falkenbach.  Then I'd say maybe Equilibrium (although the more I listen to these people the more I personally absolutely dislike them.  I mean come on, the song Unbesiegt off of Sagas is an absolute joke) and Heidevolk, etc, well you get the gist!  Here are my personal thoughts:

Eluveitie:  Their demo Ven is really good (not the re-recorded more recent version!) and definitely this one is the most ""metal"" check the song lament!  Their most famous album is Slania.  Most ""folkey"" album is Evocation 1 -the Arcane Dominion.  Personally I love the Slania - folk medley song because it is a simple rendition of most riffs from the Slania album and no ""Inis Mona"" ^^

Arkona: Everyone listens to Goi, Rode, Goi! which is still arguably their best release.  I love the song Rus off of I think their first album ever (it's a bit slower).  

Svartsot:  I have the Mulmets Viser album from them and the ""Pa Odden..."" song of that is definitely that catchiest song of the album and the whole album was the starting place for me for this band.

Hope this helped a bit! The best way to know any band? Just listen to the full album, not that hard to do as you're doing something else and just think of what you like and don't like about it.  If you're not sure where to start with a band, listen to some sample tracks from each album to decide which looks the most promising first.  The decision must ultimately be up to you of what to listen to and what to like of what you listen!  

Checking out that songs a band often plays live can help a lot to know which songs are considered more relevant if that's what you're looking for.  

Also I think a lot of folk metal is not as ""album oriented"" as we may like where there really are just a few decent songs on each album rather than the whole bands discography being relevant (well that's at least how I feel about Equilibrium haha)"
"Help me delve deeper","Thank you for the in-depth reply, I have some serious listening to work on now :P

Slavsia rus is the only track I know by arkona and is perhaps one of my favourite folk metal songs. I love the style so much :) Infact if anyone could perhaps suggest more music in the style of that song, that would be excellent. "
"Help me delve deeper","No problem!  I will put some links to make it easier:

Slavsia Rus is a good song!  Rus is actually a different track which you will probably like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvAlav12a50

And since you haven't listened to Goi, Rode, Goi! (everyone must know this track, haha) Here ya go: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR4LVp9wjN4

And maybe you will also like ""Faun"" because of their folk and vocal styles.  They are not metal but still a very good group:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwmkR7H0UNs
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKF3ps4nH2o"
"Help me delve deeper","Out of the bands you requested help with my 2 favorites are Heidevolk and Equilibrium.  I really think all their albums are solid.  I would start with their first ones and go from there.  I also like Tyr alot.  

As far as the others I am also a casual listener.  I do agree with earlier posts about Arkona's Goi Rode Goi as being a must listen.  My personal favorite is Na Moey Zemle.  It is an epic 15 minute track sung in 5 different languages.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSDIbjjGDJ8

I would also recommend checking out Dalriada, especially their last 2 albums.  Lastly, get Krampus' EP Shadows of Time.  Great album, unfortunatley their more recent music has gone in a different direction.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UteDFpZ7Bys"
"Help me delve deeper","Upvote for Faun. Check out Schrei es in de winde, you'll recognize the melody immediately if you listen to Eluveitie. ;)

Really though, Faun is great. Especially if you really liked Eluveitie unplugged. Even the guy from Subway To Sally  was on two of Faun's songs. 

Also I suck at German spelling!"

Tour Dates coming soon."
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","I am interested, I do want to see Turisas,and Chthonic. "
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","I saw Paganfest last year for Ensiferum, and I'm excited this year for Korpiklaani and Turisas. Can't wait for the Denver stop."
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","I will hopefully be seeing it Denver as well
"
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","See you there! Can't wait for the mosh pit."
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","Does anyone know why there's no European paganfest tour this year?"
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","Heidenfest just happened a few months ago and Festival season is in June. It looks like it might not happen this spring."
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","Fucking no rasputin at the turisas show in tilburg. Nobody understood, everybody screamed for rasputin..."
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","Awwwww, this is disappointing. I can't say I'm interested in seeing any of these bands this year. 

Chthonic could be interesting, and I've never seen them, but I think this is the first year that I'll be skipping this show."
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","After last year's paganfest it's definitely a disappointment, but I think it will still be a really fun show. Turisas and Korpiklaani are both amazing at putting on a fun, entertaining show. 

If I didn't have to travel to go see it I would still go. "
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","2008 was the last time I saw Turisas that I really enjoyed it. I feel like they've been mailing it in ever since and have literally gone from one of my favorite live bands to being an automatic skip.

Korpiklaani can be fun, but -- again -- they tour so frequently and play every festival that it's not a must-see for me anymore."
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","Damn that's a mega bummer - 2008 was also the last time I saw Turisas and I was super pumped to see them again."
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","I think people underestimate how perfect Hanu and Netta were for this band (haven't seen them without Tude). I saw them twice in 2012 post-Hanu/Netta leaving the band and it's just. . .not the same.

Doesn't help that they've released two underwhelming albums and their setlists are, of course, going to be based around those two (and 'Battle Metal', 'Rasputin', maybe 'One More'. . .). No thanks."
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","THEY DID NOT PLAY RASPUTIN at heidenfest 2013 in Tilburg,(netherlands) "
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","I've never seen Chthonic live, and I'm not sure if they really fit into folk, but they do some pretty great melodeath (and black in the older stuff) and use some traditional instruments like the ehru. Their performance at Taiwans Golden Music awards was pretty good ([Defenders of Bu'tik palace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZRgih2Lr_U&amp;list=PLwquGFDLGAoWboug2b56n8qwRDBUBbO2p)). There's also a lot of thought behind their songs - Takao, Broken Jade, Supreme Pain for the Tyrant and such all have videos explaining the themes behind them. Hoping they come the the UK some time this year, and I'm also desperate for Eluveitie to come here some time soon."
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","Excited for Koorpilanni and Chthonic. I haven't listened to Varg or Winterhymn, but I don't really like Turisas. Seems like an ok year. Still doesn't beat Part III"
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","One year they'll bring those bands that rarely or never come to the US... I'll skip this."
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","I've seen Korp twice, Turisas and Winterhymn once but loved their show. Plus I like these two new bands I've not seen. I'm espically excited with Chthonic because I'm really enjoying the new taste of Asian and Middle Eastern folk metal.

Forgive my ignorance so please fans of both bands if you've heard it before don't be mad but... Turisas and Varg kinda look the same?"
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","That was the first thing I noticed when I saw Varg open for Eluveitie in 2012, same style of facepaint. It'll be fun to see both at the same show."
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","I wish I could still be excited to see Turisas. They got real shitty real fast.

Hopefully Eluveitie will come around soon"
"Paganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced","Disappointing after the lineups of last few years. only interested in chthonic and they're not even actually folk metal.."

"Any Upcoming Albums for 2014?","And I'm totally fine with that!"
"Any Upcoming Albums for 2014?","I just recently read somewhere that the 2014 album will not be the follow up to Evocation I, but the source escaped me as well, sorry for that. However, they played a new song at the Eluveitie and Friends festival with their new violin player, [here's a (poor quality) recording of it on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMIv8Hq35CE)."

"Any Upcoming Albums for 2014?","Nothing's been officially posted as far as I know, but Korpiklaani comes out with albums on a frequent basis and their last release was in August of 2012, so they're past due. It should also be noted that their singer is working on an eponymous side project, but I think that's going to be straight up folk as opposed to folk metal. Speaking of Jonne Järvelä, he recently appeared on Metsatöll's new single, [Lööme Mesti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDIgdwXnRG4), so we can expect something from Metsatöll in 2014."
"Any Upcoming Albums for 2014?","Thank you all so much, I really appreciate it! this year definitely became much more exciting and I have a lot to look forward to! Thank you!"
"Any Upcoming Albums for 2014?","The new gothic/folk metal band Savn is coming with a debut album late 2013. The band consists of [Carmen Elise Espenæs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Elise_Espen%C3%A6s), the lead singer for Midnattsol, and two members of The Sins of thy Beloved.

"ALESTORM - Hangover (Taio Cruz Cover)","Eh, I wouldn't say it's their best. At least for now I still prefer Back Through Time and Captain Morgan's Revenge, but I've only listened to this one twice so far."

You're right about the throat-singing."

"KORPIKLAANI - Metsamies",""
"Same song by Metsatöll &amp; by In Extremo?","My friend &amp; I saw Metsatöll recently and heard a song that we thought had very similar lyrics / tune to [this song by In Extremo, ""Como Poden""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-ejDLeMNbA).

Does anyone know, from listening to the link, which Metsatöll song we're maybe thinking of and what album it is on?  

I've been meaning to get more into this band for awhile, and since they have a lot of albums I was thinking I could use this as a starting point.  Any help would be much appreciated.

PS: I was under the impression that this might be a song like ""Palästinalied"" that is covered by dozens of bands, so not interested even slightly in arguing about ""who did it first/better.""  Thanks in advance for sparing me from that."
"Same song by Metsatöll &amp; by In Extremo?","You probably mean [Saaremaa Vägimees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMkzwzLY4GQ) from the Hiiekoda album"
"Same song by Metsatöll &amp; by In Extremo?","Cool, thanks.  I thought after I posted to try checking concert tracklists to narrow it down, and I noticed the song you mention is on a bunch of them, so makes sense if it is that one."
"Same song by Metsatöll &amp; by In Extremo?","Im just gonna say that the quality is crap. I got it on CD and it sounds ten times better."
"Moonsorrow - Pakanajuhla",""
"Moonsorrow - Pakanajuhla","I absolutely love and adore this track.  With Moonsorrow as a whole I feel like I must be missing something because I can't get into them no matter how many attempts they're given.  Folky, jolly tracks like ""Kylän Päässä,"" ""Pakanajuhla,"" and ""Köyliönjärven Jäällä (Pakanavedet II)"" are total beloved masterpieces; but little else has ever gained my favor.  Everything else is just too atmospheric, *epic*, and bland for my tastes."
"Moonsorrow - Pakanajuhla","I agree completely. Its really hard to get into their blacker stuff for some reason, I feel the same about Finsterforst."

"Jones of Arc -- Iliad and The Odyssey..medieval tone plus bagpipes. More folk than metal.","For lovers of the pipes. Goth-pop [Jones of Arc] with Scotland's finest. 
The pipe action starts at 2:36 mins in...  So u gotta be patient and 'endure' the build-up.
This is hardcore serious Goth-philosophical rock, with a 'message'. An 'artful' message from the great Homer. Go to /r/bagpipes subreddit for more info. The song is worth a listen because it showcases the blood-stirring pipes in a  rock setting, usually ignored by ALL rock bands. "
"Jones of Arc -- Iliad and The Odyssey..medieval tone plus bagpipes. More folk than metal.","wrong sub"
"Jones of Arc -- Iliad and The Odyssey..medieval tone plus bagpipes. More folk than metal.","I must admit I posted here on spec....I'd never heard of 'folkmetal'...then the tune received 10 upvotes so today I listened to Dread Crew of Oddwood--Battle Metal...(natural and powerful sound 'art'). I think this particular tune by Jones of Arc fits in here (i.e medieval, bagpipes etc) but his other tunes certainly wouldn't."
"Jones of Arc -- Iliad and The Odyssey..medieval tone plus bagpipes. More folk than metal.","Well, there was about 15 seconds of decent bagpipes in that. I could certainly do without the rest though. I'll just leave it at that."
"Jones of Arc -- Iliad and The Odyssey..medieval tone plus bagpipes. More folk than metal.","You're a hard one...go to bagpipes reddit /r/bagpipes to see my philosophy outline re-lyrics..plus the 'vocal' chorus...how about those trumpets???....ha..ha..didn't like the chipmunk?..least he's not bullshittin ya."
"Jones of Arc -- Iliad and The Odyssey..medieval tone plus bagpipes. More folk than metal.","Sorry but wtf."
"Jones of Arc -- Iliad and The Odyssey..medieval tone plus bagpipes. More folk than metal.","Don't be sorry. Get a bottle of cream sherry and follow these instructions. Pour a full cup (250ml)..drink it, then fill a second. Play the song....You've got Roman trumpets, fanfare trumpets, virtuoso snare drumming, military bagpipes...and a SERIOUS chipmunk!! How original do u want a muso to be? Avant-Garde? (i.e out of key/out of tempo?)
I promise if you follow the above instructions, and ABSORB the sherry and opening lyrics while waiting for the 1st chorus to kick in...you will be imbued with more COURAGE and WISDOM, which of course was the song's intent."
"Jones of Arc -- Iliad and The Odyssey..medieval tone plus bagpipes. More folk than metal.","Best performed in a velvet jacket with inner lacing comfortable enough to to compared to your finest set of pajamas.  Gloves with plastic fingertips are extravagant, but make for an excellent source of counter tempo as you prance them wildly across your desk in imagery of a great battle never coming to full realization."
"Jones of Arc -- Iliad and The Odyssey..medieval tone plus bagpipes. More folk than metal.","Friend...they say its lonely at the top. I say peaceful. Reminder: They're not ""battles"" but rather ""procedures"" to enjoy. Also, you forgot the slippers...gotta have slippers...can't be seen in socks or thongs  y'know. Have another dram"

"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?",""
"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Equilibrium's a great one, as is Korpiklaani. If you don't mind a little change of scene and mood, Alestorm eschews the viking/nordic schema for a more pirate-inspired one. Alestorm is folk metal in a very different way from how tyr is folk metal, though: because they draw from sea shanties rather than traditional European folksongs, the end result is a tad different. "
"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Can't recommend Equilibrium enough.   They are one of my favourite bands of all."

"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","They literally call our Gods worthless in the song ""Back Through Time"". It really pissed me off, to be honest. 

EDIT: So I see that the immature who cannot bear to see an opinion contradictory to their own have infiltrated even this subreddit. Much more the pity for the rest of us. "
"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Thanks!"
"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Wintersun. Being headed by Ensiferum's former singer, it's very similar to earlier Ensiferum, at least the first album (simply Wintersun). While they pick up a style more their own in their second album (Time I). In any case, it's pretty magnificent. "
"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Thanks for the suggestions I really liked the sound of wintersun!"
"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","I'd probably go with Turisas for the battle/epicness factor. 
Eluveitie might be similar to what you want too"

"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Heidevolk has some songs similar to Tyr, the slower, cleaner stuff mostly"
"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Finntroll fits on the spectrum somewhere. They're something like blackened folk metal. Definitely a must listen for any folk metal fan!"
"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Try Heathen Foray."
"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Kill them for me! Bring me their skulls!"

"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Yep. I'm more of an Inner Light fan."
"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","For something a bit proggy like Týr, I's say Myrath.  They are a progressive folk metal band from Tunisia with that general ""Arabian"" sound.  For something epic like Ensiferum but a bit more blackened and with also a different ethnicity influence, there's Tengger Cavalry who are Chinese and have a general Mongolian theme.  For something more traditional in the folk metal world (By which I mean Nordic, specifically Finnish) Moonsorrow is hard to go wrong with on the epicness scale and the newest albums from Turisas and Alestorm are a bit experimental and contain some of the kind of progressive tendencies that you might associate with Týr."
"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Glittertind are similar to tyr in a way, also check out Skalmold and Finntroll"
"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Hammerfall is good too, on the Ensiferum spectrum. "

"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Came here to recommend these guys. ""Farewell To the Fallen"" is also badass! "

So is Månegarm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi49Xo0MzhA

There is also the legendary Bathory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRdVgPAe450"
"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Månegarm, but they're kind of on the edge between viking metal and folk metal, but they're good whatever genre they're in.

"What are some bands you can suggest that are similar to ensiferum or tyr?","Check out Dalriada from Hungary

They are quite folky though compared to Týr

Heljareyga is the solo project of Týr's singer. The sound is very close to Týr's ""The Lay of Thrym"".

If you like Ensiferum and Wintersun you should also dig Persefone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upv6_4WT6hY

Wolfchant are cool aswell https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK3U8pCgKXA

Dark Moor have some songs that sound quite close to Ensiferum but a little more neoclassical and with overall clear singing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOHc93GObmw

Svartsot sound like a mixture of Amon Amarth, Korpiklaani and Finntroll https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1P0VjcmzE

Then there is Waylander from Ireland who have lots of whistle going on and are a little less heavy

Visions of Atlantis share some of the epicness in Ensiferum but are overall more ""Nightwishy"" as they have a female opera singer"

Also, I've watched the video for Hail to the Hammer more times than I can count, so I laughed my ass off in shock seeing Pol with long hair. Not sure why it was so unexpected since that video is over 10 years old."

"Not exactly Folk Metal, but she's in Eluveitie so you guys might wanna take a listen.","When they were doing their tour for Helvetios she sang [Scorched Earth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwOCbNpiz90) replacing the guy on the album version, it was fucking amazing. There are lots of videos of it, I'm not sure the one I linked is the best, check around. The [recording](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUHA_s_v-iU) from the show I saw sucks though. But it was great live at least."
"Not exactly Folk Metal, but she's in Eluveitie so you guys might wanna take a listen.","I backed her album on Kickstarter when she launched the campaign. So happy to see this getting love.

"NORTHLAND NEW ALBUM TRAILER!!","I first heard their demo music on Myspace years ago when I was quite young. Still today, ""Where the Heroes Die"" still give me that insane adrenaline rush that makes me want to charge into battle."
"NORTHLAND NEW ALBUM TRAILER!!","Man. Haven't heard these guys before. But after this teaser, I'm pumped for this album. Sounds fantastic."
"NORTHLAND NEW ALBUM TRAILER!!",":) Would highly recommend their self-titled album. Really great stuff! The ONLY song that is less than good is Distant Land...as the guest vocals are pretty weak and off key. Otherwise, the album is one of the best in the folk metal scene imo"
"NORTHLAND NEW ALBUM TRAILER!!","Definitely will check it out."
"In case you guys didn't know...",""
"In case you guys didn't know...","If anyone's curious, I believe the new album will be a follow-up to Evocation I, so more folk and less metal."
"In case you guys didn't know...","And that's awesome.  There's enough melodic metal out there, I want more folk metal!  I can't wait.  Eluveitie is definitely in my top 10 bands."
"In case you guys didn't know...","It's still Eluveitie.  Therefore, by definition, it is still awesome."
"In case you guys didn't know...","Fuck yes. That album was so incredibly well done I struggle to listen to 'normal' Eluveitie any longer. The follow up can't come fast enough."
"In case you guys didn't know...","Their blog says it's a follow-up to Helvetios.
Edit: Either way, I'm beyond excited!"
"In case you guys didn't know...","I think that may just mean that this will be the next album. I remember Chrigel doing interviews shortly after Helvetios dropped and him saying they were looking to do a folk-centered album again."
"In case you guys didn't know...","awwwwwww yeaaaaaaah"

"
"Any Equilibrium fans out there? They made a video game has anyone played it?","yeah! Their old singer left at the same time as their drummer. They actually have had a complete change of lineup. The only original member is Rene, one of the guitarist.

I was skeptical at first when the change of lineup kept happening but, they have kept on with the overall atmosphere of what makes Equilibrium amazing. I'm actually quite content  because many bands are having lineup changes and I'm not adjusting as well, for example:  Arch Enemy.  "

"Folk Metal Guitarists...","What's the tuning for folk metal? I'm a guitar noob and would like to start playing some folk metal. Where should I start?"
"Folk Metal Guitarists...","I would say E Standard, Eb Standard or D Standard."
"Folk Metal Guitarists...","(to add to MeatloafCupcake) Like above, except it's really genre dependent so if you're interested in more powermetally, early Elvenking type folk-metal then any of the above, but if you're more into Viking metal they'll be tuned lower generally. E and D standard are the most common tunings, if you have a floating bridge switching between tunings is a hassle so either pick a tuning you personally like or get more than one guitar and keep them at different tunings."
"Folk Metal Guitarists...","Amon Amarth plays B and occasionally A, which is pretty insane.  Tyr uses 7 strings that range from a high E to B.  I don't know about any others but I assume it's in the vicinity of E or D for most bands."
"Folk Metal Guitarists...","I don't think its about a specific tuning more about the tune you get from it. you can make any kind of music with any kind of tuning if you try hard enough. when it comes to folk metal I see the guitar as less of a main instrument because I think there are different areas added in like: Pipes, Violin, Accordion etc. but thats just my opinion its still an important part tho."
"Folk Metal Guitarists...","that does make alot of sense"
"Folk Metal Guitarists...","What I mean is you shouldn't try to just restrict yourself to one type of tuning for playing folk metal. its more about the tunes you make than the tuning its in. just my opinion tho"
"Folk Metal Guitarists...","Folk metal bands don't use downtuned guitars nearly as much as other subgenres of metal such as doom or death metal to name a few. It really just depends on the band."
"Folk Metal Guitarists...","My band uses Drop G (7 string) and drop C (6 string) but its rare for folk metal bands to go so low.

I'd say D standard would be the most common alternate tuning."
"Folk Metal Guitarists...","Nothing too wild generally (either E standard, E flat, drop D, or D standard, much like you'd see in most metal) with the exception of Finntroll.  Finntroll are weird..."
"Folk Metal Guitarists...","I predominantly play folk metal on guitar and I'm either in standard or a half step down. Honestly, when your weaving folk metal melodies on guitar, just play it in different keys until it sounds good.  Natural minor scales are your friend too."
"Folk Metal Guitarists...","Most of the stuff seems to be played in standard. I've heard some acoustic tracks played in an open tuning though so you could explore that a bit. /r/guitar would be a good source for some more info on that if you like."

"ELUVEITIE - The Call Of The Mountains (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO)",""
"ELUVEITIE - The Call Of The Mountains (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO)","LOL Ok, so I love Eluveitie, but over in /r/metal they were just talking about how Wintersun (another Nuclear Blast band) didn't have enough money from the label to record their album properly, and I look down and this song is recorded in *five* different languages, including Romansh, which I had not previously heard of (surprisingly, really). Along with a bunch of gorgeous music videos. 

I know this is total oversimplification, but it's interesting how labels decide where the money goes. "
"ELUVEITIE - The Call Of The Mountains (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO)","I like the song, but my personal opinion is that Origins has been a little underwhelming in comparison to older Eluveitie albums. I hate to see their music get formulaic. I feel like they've lost their groove a bit, and have fallen into that cycle of ""We have to produce this"", rather than ""We want to produce this"". 

I'd like to see them make Evocation II. Switching gears for awhile making another acoustic album may be what they need to really turn things around."
"ELUVEITIE - The Call Of The Mountains (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO)","I got a very mainstream metal vibe from this. Could've told me it was Evanescence and I wouldn't have questioned it (without the video)."
"ELUVEITIE - The Call Of The Mountains (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO)","This could just be the ""Rose for Epona"" of the new album. It was the only song of its kind on Helvetios, and that was a great album. We'll see, I suppose."
"ELUVEITIE - The Call Of The Mountains (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO)","There's at least one ""Omnos"" in every album. Still I like it. "

Really well composed stuff! As a producer, my only bit of advice is to try to add better definition to your individual tracks. Especially when mixing guitar, if you can get into the habit of putting each guitar in its own ""pitch range"" (keep rhythm low on the neck, and put lead higher) they will be more easily distinguished. Even try using a different pickup when recording harmony parts then when you record the main lead. You will be amazed at the difference. You are definitely on the right track man! Big big props to you!"

"Turisas2013 on Metal Archives","I've only recently read the reviews on the Metal Archives and although they generally share the same opinion as myself, I find the overly-harsh reviews drag down an album's rating.

Case in point: Summoning.  As an atmospheric black metal band, you can expect a lot of things from any of their releases.  A hell of a lot of reverb, lots of keys and LONG songs.  

Some idiot wrote a review to one of their albums giving it a low score because ""there is too my synth; this isn't black metal, and the songs are too long.""  Like really?  If you were a fan of Summoning or even listened to one album, you'd KNOW that that's EXACTLY what to expect.  

It seems like many people listen to albums of genres they don't like and just decide ""this is shit, better write a review.""

"Looking for suggestions for a picky listener","So I recently got my husband to start listening to folk metal, but I'm relatively new to the genre myself and he's very particular about what he likes/dislikes, so I'd appreciate recommendations.

He really liked Arkona and Heidevolk and a smattering of others, didn't do so well with In Extremo (apparently the bagpipes are too high-pitched?) and Tyr (not sure why, exactly). He likes Finntroll's acoustic album (or maybe he just tolerates it because our 4-year-old daughter is obsessed with it) but not their standard fare - too much screaming. 

Aside from that, he prefers male vocals (although the deeper/richer female vocals like Arkona or, in a totally different genre, Loreena McKennitt are good too) and doesn't like too much in the way of high-pitched instruments. Bagpipes especially tend to be a deal-breaker.

Suggestions?"
"Looking for suggestions for a picky listener","Metsatoll"
"Looking for suggestions for a picky listener","This one went over fairly well, thanks!"
"Looking for suggestions for a picky listener","Elvenking is a pretty good metal band, and very fantasy-based. Somewhat light on the folk though - just a violin and some acoustic guitars for parts of songs. I'd recommend anything off ""The Pagan Manifesto"", especially Witches Gather. "
"Looking for suggestions for a picky listener","In Extremo is an acquired taste, I like one or two of their songs (Vollmund, Vanera vrende I can't spell...) but it's sad to say that their lead singer sounds better as a guest vocalist on other band's songs. (He gets like, one tiny verse in Faun's ""Bundes Volk"" and totally wins... at that verse. He also wins on his cameo on a live clip of Schandmaul's ""Willst Du"".) 

Speaking of, they are very much not metal, but Faun. I'm not sure how he'll like it but they make good music. ""Blaue Stunde"" has a guest male singer who's name I can't remember. Faun is wonderful, but not metal. (I'm not sure exactly if Fiona plays bagpipes, it kind of blurs together with the hurdy gurdy sometimes.)

I don't think Subway To Sally have bagpipes in their music.Crunchy is how I describe them.They are part of an offshoot of folk metal called mitteralter/medieval metal/rock (Faun is a non-metal part of this genre).I'm not sure how well the lead singer's voice will go over if he didn't like In Extremo.

I'm really out of the loop with folk metal, didn't listen to it for well over a year (not my choice). So what little serious folk metal I remember is stuck in summer 2010, even that's a little blurry. (Oddly enough I got into all the medieval stuff via Eluveitie.)

One last thing: I have found quite a few new bands to listen to via streaming radio. Base a station on a band he likes and see if he finds anything else he likes from that."
"Looking for suggestions for a picky listener","Good suggestions all around, thanks!"
"Looking for suggestions for a picky listener","&gt; Subway To Sally have bagpipes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRwvj0H5ia8

They have it pretty rarely because if they use it their lead singer plays it. 

and it is mittelalter ;)

The songnames are: Vänner och frände and Vollmond

And because you like Micha as a guestsinger if got another appearance from him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msz97HQo2-E (with the singer of subway https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sifM_9DIVbI)"

I have so much to watch! Thanks!

Edit I was one letter off on mittelalter! I can't process words too well sometimes."
"Looking for suggestions for a picky listener","Faun went over beautifully - the best of the recommendations to date. Not really metal (okay, not at all metal, heh) but he fell in love with it. It almost has a Blackmore's Night feel, but richer... good stuff.

In Extremo is still a no-go, which makes me sad."

"Looking for suggestions for a picky listener","Try Nine Treasures, they have a very oriental feel but it might be interesting enough to hook you and him up :)

In the same style there's also Tengger Cavalry who make great stuff, mixing mongolian throat chants with pagan/folk metal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUja-wrQVgs


Also you might try more acoustic pagan bands like Krauka(Norse Traditional Music), Stille Volk(French Medieval Folk), Corvus Corax(Very popular Acoustic Metalish Folk band from Germany), Batards du Nord(Quebecois Traditional Norse Music), Tribu Kornu(Same as Batards but Irish trad). Imo, they all fit very well in a metal playlist as their sound and themes fit very well with Folk Metal and they provide an interlude between face melting songs. Have fun.

What does he usally listen to?"
"Looking for suggestions for a picky listener","He's pretty eclectic - which is to say that he goes through phases where he listens to a genre vastly different from the previous one, and then gets bored with it and starts looking for new things. We've been through a Disturbed/Godsmack phase, a pop phase, a broody goth phase, a country-and-western phase (that one was *particularly* trying for yours truly), a Celtic/New Age phase which casually blended into a neopagan phase (which - some of those guys are amazing artists, but then you have stuff like Moonstruck, which he inexplicably couldn't get enough of but which, to me, sounded like cats having their paws stepped on, repeatedly....) There was an 80s phase (actually that one comes and goes quite a big, because nostalgia) and even a very brief rap phase. And so on."

"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","When it comes to thrash there is Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer. So which bands do you think are the ""Big 4"" of folk metal. They don't have to be your favorites."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Finntroll, Eluveitie, Korpiklaani, Ensiferum 

are the first that come to mind"
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","How popular exactly are Eluveitie?  They seem to have got pretty big lately."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","They packed the Hollywood House of Blues when I saw them last November. I'd say they're pretty big. I also see at the very least two or three Eluveitie shirts whenever I go to a folk metal concert here."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Nah, Wintersun packed the House of Blues.  Crowd thinned out when Eluveitie went on stage. "
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Yeah, this is probably the correct answer. I guess you *might* be able to make an argument for Equilibrium, though."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","This is indeed a good list. Equilibrium and Moonsorrow are my favorite bands so I'd like to see them in it though. I don't know if they're popular enough to be included. Equilibrium could raise their popularity hugely by playing outside the Central Europe more. At least here in Finland it's much less known than the Finnish bands or Eluveitie for example.

EDIT: I might argue that Turisas could be in that list in terms of both popularity and quality."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Turisas doesn't have as much folk in their sound since the first couple albums, so it's debatable. They'd be my next contender, though."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","I'm a huge fan of Equilibrium and Turisas, but I think part of what gets Equilibrium is also their German-exclusive lyrics. Lyrics in English tend to garner a more global audience, but a lot of bands have managed to become really popular without (like Gorgoroth in Black Metal). Also, Turisas dropped some of that folk sound in their newest album since they don't have Netta Skog on accordion anymore. :(

But I'd have to say Eluveitie, Korpiklaani, and Ensiferum definitely belong there. Flinntroll is good, too, but I think that 4th spot is up for debate.

EDIT: Clarified that Gorgoroth is Black Metal."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Mine exactly, although I would break the rule and add Tyr as a different take on folk metal (as in sans folk intruments)"
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","This is a good grouping. All well-known and productive groups, but pretty diverse, too."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Exactly what I was thinking. "
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","I was going to say the same.. 3 of those bands came to Australia this year I didn't see eluvatie due to money, and I'm not as interested in them as other bands, hoping Finntroll comes here soon! "
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","I'd exchange Ensiferum for Moonsorrow."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Nah. Ensiferum is better known than Moonsorrow. I like both quite a lot though."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","I think we'd also have to mention Týr; it's not specifically folk metal fans that listen to it(and apparently one of the Metallica band members likes it too)."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","And Rob Halford!  I would agree with bpmetal for popularity, but if we're going by authenticity than [old] Týr is the winner."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Týr, ensiferum, moonsorrow, korpiklaani, and finntroll. Although, I have found folk metal that I like much more than most of this stuff(except tyr. Tyrs old stuff is folk Prog gold) like finsterforst and draugnim"
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","[deleted]"
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Reading through all these comments made me sad. 31 comments in and no one has the absolute definitive folk metal band listed. Skyclad.

If we're talking influence alone, the Big 4 (or 5) probably looks like:

* Skyclad
* Primordial
* Bathory
* Cruachan/Mago de Oz


When they talk about The Big 4 in thrash, it's about influence *and* popularity. I find it really, really difficult to include Eluveitie and Korpiklaani in a list of ""influential"" folk metal bands given how recent their ""success"" has been.

I could probably agree the list looks something like:

* Skyclad
* Ensiferum
* Finntroll
* Primordial

It's tough for me to not include Orphaned Land (first album released in 1992) but I don't think their sphere of influence is as great as Primordial's despite the fact that I honestly rarely listen to the latter. I think most folk metal today draws most of their influence from Bathory/Primordial/Skyclad though.

Sometimes I feel like the only person around here who listened to folk metal before 2001."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","I'm a bit late to the party, but I just have to agree with you. I often get angry at how Skyclad gets overlooked in these kind of discussions. That's like talking about most influential bands in metal in general and not mentioning Black Sabbath. It's ridiculous. "
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Eluveitie's Helvetica is one of the greatest folk metal albums in my opinion. A whole album devoted to the Gallic Wars and the Helvetii in particular. "
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","I would say Turisas, Eluveitie, Korpiklaani, and Ensiferum"
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","I think due to sheer longevity and consistency Finntroll have to be up there, they've kept their folk sound throughout, unlike Turisas who are significantly less folk since their last couple of albums."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","This would be my list, too. Though it would be a tough call between Turisas and Tyr."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","That was my problem too. Since Tyr is less folk metal I decided to go with Turisas."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Moonsorrow, Týr, Korpiklaani and Eluveitie"
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Ensiferum, Korpiklaani, Turisas, Tyr.

Followed by Eluveitie, Equilibrium, Heidevolk, and Moonsorrow."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","If we're going for a true Big Four style (as in all from the same area, all developed around the same time) then I'd say Finntroll, Korpiklaani, Ensiferum and Turisas, as they're all Finnish and all started in roughly the same few years. Plus it includes a band who started out as folk metal but as their popularity grew they abandoned folk in favour of a more generic, saleable sound in the vein of Metallica (I'm looking at you Turisas!)  
  
However if we're going for consistent sound and sphere of influence then it has to be Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani and Eluveitie (I toyed with Tyr for a while but they've had less and less folk metal tracks on their albums in recent years, opting for more standard prog metal stuff).  
  
You could also argue that Moonsorrow are the Megadeth of folk metal, as one of their members is/was also a member of another big four band (Dave Mustaine is to Metallica as Henri Sorvali is to Finntroll)"
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","/u/bpmetal has it right in term of popularity.  Personally, I would say Týr, Ensiferum, Moonsorrow, Arkona.  My favorites.

I might pick Dalriada, Skalmold, Heljareyga, and Irminsul as an alt 'Smaller Big 4'."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","I'd switch Moonsorrow for Equilibrium and Ensiferum for Turisas. But I support your choice of Arkona. I think Big 4 of folk metal should represent folk music from different countries."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","I would like to argue Turisas as well, as they were one of the three bands that got me into folk metal (along with Korpiklaani and Ensiferum,) but the fact of the matter is that recently they've gone for a more prog/power metal sound with these last two albums, which constitutes approximately half of their discography."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","It was a hard decision between Korpiklaani and Turisas for me as well. You are right about them gone more power/prog, so considering Turisas' last album, Korpiklaani could fit in the Big 4 of folk metal instead of Turisas."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","""Smaller Big 4"" is right.  I mean as it is, Folk Metal is a massively niche genre and within that genre, there are even more obscure, less well known bands.  I'm a massive folk metal fan and out of your ""Small Big 4"" I only knew two.  

Of course I know of all the others people posted.  ""Big 4"" doesn't necessarily relate to music quality but to popularity and general recognition.  

As much as I love Eluveitie, I believe Moonsorrow has far grander, truly epic songs that are far more varying in their sound and composition, however they are less well known.  Moonsorrow are probably one of the best folk metal bands as they display true mastery of the art.  

Out of the bands posted I believe Equilibrium, Eluveitie and Korpiklanni are probably the ones most likely to have a wider appeal to those who are not fans of folk metal or even heavy metal which is why I would place them on a ""Best 4"" list. (Insert whichever band you like as number 4; I don't believe Finntroll or Arkona are easily accessible despite being two of my favourite bands.) "
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Which were the 2 you didn't know?  And I agree with pretty much everything you said."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Heljareyga, and Irminsul.  Never heard of them before :P
"
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Heljareyga is Heri Joensen's side project.  They're like old Tyr with a lot of progressive influences.  Irminsul is a really obscure folk-melodeathish band from Sweden that I found by accident.  Their really good I think."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Yeah I found out as soon as I listened to them both.  I found Heljareyga too be way too similar to Tyr (go figure; it basically is the same) for my liking, but Irminsul sounded great.

Thanks for introducing me to some new great bands."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","I think Heljareyga sounds like older Tyr but a bit more upbeat and proggy.  I'm hoping their next album can fill the void that new Tyr left behind."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Moonsorrow, Finntroll, Ensiferum, Eluveitie"
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Ensiferum, Korpiklaani, Tyr, and Turisas. At least, that's my approach to it."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Eluveitie, Korpiklaani, Alestorm and Finntroll.

I think we should put this to a vote.

"
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","On a side note, it's amazing how much folk metal has grown in popularity and acceptance in recent years (sounding like a hipster now but fuck it), here in the UK when I was introduced to folk metal a good decade or so ago, it was really unknown and pretty niche, but now these bands are selling out pretty sizeable venues and are given major coverage by mainstream metal media. Still, my chances of forming a folk metal band are nonetheless slim at best."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","If ""Folk Metal"" means metal mixed with folk elements, from whatever culture, I would seriously add Orphaned Land in the top 10. Maybe not the top 4 since the most recent album is not really good, but so is Ensiferum's."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Well if its following the rules of the thrash big four it would have to be with worst 4 folk metal bands...not the 4 best"
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","1. Korpiklaani
2. Ensiferum
3. Blind Guardian 
4. Fintroll 

If it were choice by favorites I'd substitute Elvenking for Fintroll."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","As much as I love Blind Guardian, they are power metal, not folk metal."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","[deleted]"
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Probably because it's a stretch to call them folk, nobody would deny they're an amazingly talented and popular band though. Unless you're enough of a hipster to dislike anything simply because it is ""trending"" anyways."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Wintersun are one of the best bands out there but I've never seen anyone call them folk."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Yeah, I think Wintersun is more melodic death metal."
"Who are the Big 4 of folk metal?","Perhaps thematically, but they lack the folk sound yeah "

for example, their demo and first album relied very heavily on atmosphere.  Some of their songs even boarder lined soundscapes.  Then, when sagas came out, they began to rely more on the riff, but still retained a healthy atmosphere.  With Rekreatur, they began to sound closer to a heavy metal band with folk influences which was further solidified with Erdentemple. 

Not that this is a bad thing, I'm just super interested to here what influenced the change."

"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","When and how did you get into folk metal? Which band did you first listen to? What immediately or gradually attracted you to the genre? Go into great detail if you like.

EDIT: So many bands in this thread I haven't heard of. Freaking awesome guys."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I think the first folk metal band I ever heard was Korpiklaani, a lot of years ago. My friends from highschool at the time were showing the video to everyone, laughing at it (in a negative way, none of them liked metal). Someone showed it to me and I was like 'umm, that's badass'. I'm pretty sure I was mostly into prog/power metal at the time, mostly Dream Theater and Blind Guardian.

I don't listen to Korpiklaani basically ever nowadays, but I quickly discovered Ensiferum, Wintersun, Tyr, Finntroll, and others after that. "
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","None of my close friends are into it either. My closest friend shares almost all musical interests with me except for folk metal. I really wish it had a bigger following in the states. It sucks having to see these amazing bands come here to tiny ass venues and bars."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I live in the UK and I've only got like 3 friends who like it and they live in a different city. :(

Everyone in London just listens to djent all day. "
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Haha I love djent, and oddly enough, there aren't many folks around here who like that either. I feel your pain though. I'm surrounded by people who either listen to country or hip hop. "
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I live in the UK, none of my friends are really into metal at all, though some listen to it from time to time. But those that listen to metal from time to time can bare lamb of god as the heaviest band in existence so getting them into folk metal will never happen, no matter how much I try."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","When I was 11 and had to take sewing class at school a guy from another class asked me what kind of music I liked, and at the time as I barely knew about sub-genres I replied with ""heavy metal"", then he asked me what kinds of heavy metal I liked. Of course, I didn't know about different sub-genres so he just told me a few (death, black, folk, doom, white). Folk music was my second favourite music genre right after metal, so folk metal sounded like a best of both worlds type thing. When I got home I searched ""folk metal"" on YouTube, and I came across a few bands including Korpiklaani and Finntroll, now they're two of my top 10 bands of all time."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I went to a DragonForce concert in Atlanta in 2008. Turisas was one of the opening acts. At first I didn't understand what they were trying to convey, then I looked them up about a week later. They have been my favorite band since and I haven't missed an opportunity to see them live in Atlanta.  "
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","They headlined on that tour for the new Orleans show! Dragon force wasn't there and I was happy and it was amazing! I have the set list framed on my dresser still."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Long story short: Fuck yeah, vikings!"
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","The band that I listened to that got me into metal was Amon Amarth. You can kinda guess what happened from there. Heard about Ensiferum and the rest is history"
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I went to Paganfest III because Alestorm was playing. I left in love with Arkona."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I got into folk metal my first or second year of college. I was working in a tire and lube place at Walmart, changing oil and tires and stuff. At the time, I listened to some progressive metal, death metal, and I think a lot of System of a Down, which has always been my favorite band. So, this guy came in for an oil change, rock and roll lookin' dude, so I happened to be the one to pull his car into the shop. As I pulled it in, his radio was blasting some metal, the likes of which I had never head before. It was heavy, fast, a lot of synth, and very melodic. I turned it down a bit, but not all the way. I immediately became interested in the sound, but put it out of my mind until I got back in the car to pull it out of the shop. This time, I ejected the CD to see what it was. It was Wintersun's self-titled album. I downloaded the album when I got home (I have since purchased it), and I listened to that heavily for the next few weeks. This was before I used Pandora, Reddit, so I didn't have any way to find more music like it, as I didn't even know what genre it is. After a few weeks, I was talking about Wintersun in class with this kid who was into shitty obscure punk that sounds like speaker vomit, and this other kid overheard and told me if I liked Wintersun, I should definitely check out Ensiferum. I have no idea how I remembered that name until I got home, but when I did, I looked them up and my mind exploded. I went on wikipedia and started looking up related bands and now I'm a pretty big fan of the genre and I'm still discovering more. None of my friends are really into it, but I can drag them to a show once in a while. I rarely see shows living in upstate NY. Ensiferum came here a couple years ago, as well as Tyr, and those were amazing. How I got into Tyr is another story altogether, but they are a favorite of mine. I also saw Wintersun around the same time, which had been a dream of mine since I first heard them. Incidentally, they were not headlining that night, and I we almost left after they finished, as I had to work in the morning, but we decided to give the headliner a chance for a song or two. Ended up staying for the entire show. The headliner was Eluvietie, who I had not heard of, but after their first song I was blown away. They played through an entire album and it was spectacular. Every time he went from growling straight to a tin flute solo, I both laughed and cheered. Only folk metal can offer that awesome of a show."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","&gt; I rarely see shows living in upstate NY.  

Tell me about it; I go to school upstate, and none of the bands I like ever come closer than NYC."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Yeah it sucks. Every once in a while they'll come to Buffalo or Rochester, where I think they're gaining a following. I can't afford to miss those shows. All in all, we don't get much up here. And when we do, it's on a fucking Monday or Tuesday night so they can be in NYC by Friday."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Well the worst part is that I don't have a car at school, and I don't really know any other folk metal fans there. I live in New England, too, which means I miss out on anyone that comes to Worcester in the fall, which is everyone."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","It's tough finding fellow fans. I assume you reside at a university at the moment. I almost guarantee there are fans there, it's just that in my experience, those individuals are somewhat introverted, so they're tough to find. You'll never hear them blasting it with their windows down, or involved in academic or many social gatherings.

As with any niche interest that may not seem to have much of a local presence, it could be a ""If you build it, they will come"" scenario. Someone needs to organize some forum for fans to meet. Someone can book a classroom or small auditorium for a folk metal appreciation night or something. Most colleges give students the ability to organize all sorts of things if students think to ask. I've seen students do this for things like Dragonball Z, Nerf, old movies, whatever. And if there's any food there, that will be a huge plus. Campus residents are always hungry."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","2001 -- Ensiferum.

Heard 'Hero in a Dream' while on vacation at a family friend's house that had this new-fangled ""metal channel"" on their television (some digital music channel). It was before the album had even been released and the station was playing a bunch of promo tracks.

Loved the song. Went home and immediately bought the album -- my first ever online purchase as well -- directly from Spinefarm (or Spikefarm, whatever it was) and received it without knowing anything about the band. Haven't looked back since."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I found this streaming metal radio station in college around 2006 (because I couldn't stand the radio anymore), and I heard all these crazy songs I've never heard before. Some were just Iron Maiden and Judas Priest songs they don't play on the radio, but then I heard ""The Bard's Song"" - Blind Guardian, and I was hooked. I went to youtube and found a bunch of their stuff, and then found bands like Tyr and Korpiklaani. I went to a Blind Guardian concert in 2006, and from there discovered Leaves' Eyes. Then I went to a Tyr concert in 2008 (I think, their first time in the US), and discovered Turisas and Eluveitie. From there, just following youtube and Pandora, I've had more than enough new music to keep me interested and away from the radio."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I had a friend who I was playing some Halo:Reach with and he mentioned Alestorm, after he described I felt I had to look it up and then after I fell in love with that I slowly found Tyr, Eluvietie, Ensiferum, Wintersun and have an ever growing list of bands I find through this sub and spotify. Before Alestorm though I listened to mostly metalcore and hard rock now Power and Folk metal are my bread and butter with a sprinkling of other various metal genres."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I was hoping to go to see Dragonforce so I looked up the opening act (Turisas). I never got to go to the concert, but Turisas really sucked me in with Battle Metal."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Funny story, I was at Ozzfest years ago, long before I heard any folk metal. Dragonforce was opening on the main stage to a thin audience. I was at the second stage watching some thrash metal band, so I only faintly heard them. Years later I discovered Dragonforce and thought, shit I could have seen them live...

Also, thanks for pointing out Turisas. I've seen the name but never checked them out. Now I will."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","My metal journey started when my older brother introduced me to Spellblast.  Before I was listening to Chevelle and Avenged Sevenfold.  I started listening to them and loved what I heard.  My interests lead me to more power/folk as I'm not a big fan of the majority of vocals being harsh.  This lead me to Elvenking, Kiuas (mainly power, but just the right amount of folk) and then Korpiklaani, Týr, Wintersun, Skyclad, etc.

My favorite band I discovered is Kiuas, and I am currently really into Dalriada.  So, yeah.  I'm not your typical folk metal listener, but if you like more melodic vocals to go with your folk metal, in addition to what I've mentioned check out Boisson Divine, Falconer, Heidevolk, Metsatöll, and Vexillum."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Whatever happened to Kiuas? I only heard one song by them but it was really good."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Broke up last year, sadly..."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Man that sucks. "
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I remember when I thought Finntroll was 'too heavy'....Good times."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","You too? I couldn't get into them (or amon amarth) for a good while. Acquired tastes for sure."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","2007- a friend of mine showed me Drudkh, Temnozor and Eluveitie. Back then I was more into grunge and alternative rock (Nirvana, etc), and didn't really care for the aggressive vocals often used in metal, but gradually Drudkh won me over. Found Arkona from Temnozor's song of the same name and was blown away by Masha; Eluveitie's Slania was released. I was hooked."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Back in the MySpace days, a buddy of mine had a Fintroll song (Trollhammaren) on his profile, it would automatically start playing every time you loaded his page. I was more into metalcore/hardcore/gindcore at the time, but I was really captivated by the melodies in the song. A few years later, I had German class in college with a kid who wore a Finntroll shirt. I started talking to him about folk metal, he showed me Ensiferum/Wintersun, and the rest was history. You're the man, Roy! "
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I knew a guy named Stew who used to do live shows on BlogTv. The dude was a total badass viking loving metal head and I decided to ask him about the music he had playing when he'd do a show. I was just beginning to discover a bit of metal music and was just attracted to what I heard. He showed me songs from a bunch of bands, half I don't remember. So then I started listening gradually to bands like; Amon Amarth, Finntroll, Turisas, Alestorm, etc. Being a massive fan of vikings and their culture it was easy to fall in love. Now to just find a friend that shares my interest in music..."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Do you remember Stew's username on Blogtv?"
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","StewGuitarFest ;P"
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Must have hung out in different circles on Blog. I have most of my folk metal music from listening to Choppers Metal."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Yeah most of my time was spent in cartoon rooms. xD"
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Back in the early 90s I discovered Unleashed (my all time favorite band of any genre, mostly based on their Victory album and earlier), which taught me that there were bands that had Viking and Norse Mythology themes.  

Some time shortly thereafter I learned of Einherjer (specifically Dragons of the North) and that officially put Viking and Folk Metal on my radar.  

In addition, a wide array of other bands, including the likes of Otyg, Månegarm, Amon Amarth, Finntroll, and early Vintersorg (first 3) solidified the general interest in Folk Metal, Viking Metal, and Viking Death Metal."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I had a Gamma Ray pandora station which had a few folk metal songs. Namely Vodka by Korpiklaani and Dead Man's Reel by SuidAkrA. That was my introduction and i just kept searching a little bit after hearing those. But I'd say my REAL introduction was Blut Im Auge by Equilibrium. 

I was playing guitar in my basement one summer and just hopping from genre/band to genre/band on a tab website. I saw the title and found it interesting so I clicked it. I loved the sound that came out even though it was just [a shitty sounding guitar pro tab](http://www.songsterr.com/a/wsa/equilibrium-blut-im-auge-tab-s23609t0) but I looked up the real song and HATED it. I couldn't get past the vocals. I could only do clean at this time. but the melody was so awesome that I kept listening to it until I liked it. the rest is history."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I think I saw Trollhammaren in youtube suggestions while listening to some Kamelot or something back in 2008 or 2009. From there I really got into Finntroll and Eluveitie, met a friend who introduced me to Tyr, Ensiferum, Turisas, Falkenbach, and fell in love with the genre. Since then I've moved on a bit though, mostly to atmospheric/epic black.
"
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I think my first introduction to folk metal was borrowing Turisas CD (the varangian way) from library. I didn't really think of it as folk metal at the time, just nice viking themed power metal (and i still think that most of Turisas songs are closer to PM than FM, but that's just me...)

My next introduction was downloading randomly found Korpiklaani with DC++ (lol, p2p is so damn unreliable these days... torrents are much easier to use and find what you're looking for). I saw their name in a music folder and downloaded and fell in love...

I can't really say when i began actively listening and seeking more folk metal, but last year i had a big surge, especially joining this sub."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","It began when I was in 8th grade (2012) when I was researching norse paganism as I was interested in the subject. The song that was playing over the video was ""Your Gaulish War"" by Eluveitie. It first blew me away from the opening mandolin straight to the flutes+guitars. The thing that held me back however was that I wasn't a fan of growling vocals (I grew up listening to bands that didn't use growling vocals i.e. Led Zeppilin, The Who, and U2). I grew up with Lord of the Rings and the soundtrack was amazing and Folk metal was that mixed with LZ. But after listening to more Eluveitie songs, I had gotten used to growls and I felt its passion. Folk metal incorporates elegance, and peacefulness, with sheer energy of which I had never heard before. I then found Arkona, then Krampus, then Finntroll, and many others. Krampus especially blew me away with their album ""Survival of the Fittest"" as the lyrics were environmental and very critical of modern society. As I am very critical of modern society and my love of nature, I felt like this was for me. I've now found 34 Folk metal bands and that number keeps on growing. Now Finntroll and Eluveitie are tied for my favorite band. I would love to go to a concert but high school is my number one priority right now and the bands never come through my area of northern New Jersey, But it would be great and extraordinary to go see one. "
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Cant remember exactly, but I think the first folkmetal album I heard was Jaktens Tid, then I quickly moved on to Eluveitie."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Back in 2007 I was sitting in a hot tub in Richmond British Colombia when one of my friends put on ""trollhammaren"" by finntroll
And that did it, set me on a path I will never regret...
Started a band that day and have toured and played multiple shows with finntroll and with other well established folk metal acts....
"
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","I downloaded a few .mp3s of Finntroll and Korpilaani on SoulSeek back in 2005 or something."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","My life was a fuzzy blur then.  (I was really sick)  but I remember Eluveitie. Not sure if they were the first but I remember them the most. They also survived as one of the few bands I still listen to from that time in my life.

Bonus: I have inis mona as the ringtone on my old phone,  because I would never hear it ring if it wasn't ""growling"". Scares people but I secretly wish someone would be all ""Eluveitie!""

I doubt anyone is going to be yelling ""Arkona!"" at my new phone though. 

Edit... I was listening to Finntroll, Korpiklaani (spelling fail), Turisas... at that time too."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","The first FM song I heard was Ensiferum's ""Little Dreamer,"" and I was instantly hooked. 

I always had a penchant for Norse mythology, Norse History (Vikings, etc) and whatnot, and I *love* the melodies in Folk Metal. Something about it just makes me happy. "
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Not really folk metal but my first introduction to something like it was Amon Amarth. My friend showed me them and I started checking out bands that were in the same vain as them."
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","It was either Korpiklaani or Ensiferum, I can't quite remember which I'd heard first, it was a long time ago. But once I discovered Skyclad I fell in love with the genre fully. Skyclad are still one of my favourite bands and my favorite folk metal band. 

Also, Tyr was one of the first folk metal bands I heard, back when they had only released two albums and hardly anyone knew about them. I stumbled upon The Wild Rover on Metalstorm radio. I've been a fan of Tyr ever since.    "
"How did you first discover folk metal? Tell us a tale.","Long time NWOBHM and Powermetal fan. Listening to a metal station on Live365 and heard Pagan Purity by Elvenking (from when they weren't shit). Was hooked after that."

"Any great Spanish-speaking metal bands I'm missing out on?","Songza served me up a Mago de Oz song a while back and I'm finding that I really dig them.  If you've not heard them, check them out; they have a real classic proto-metal kind of feel, like Black Sabbath or The Sword.  They incorporate folksy instruments too, of course.

But other than them, what should I look into?

I've been trying to pick up Spanish for a while now.  I've had several classes in it, but I know part of picking up a language is hearing or using it on a regular basis.  Finding Spanish language music I like seems to have been difficult.  Every time I look, most of what I turn up is pure Latin music with whistles and trumpets, mariachis, sappy ballads, or pop songs.  I was really thrilled to hear Mago de Oz rockin' it on the  organ and fiddle; Finisterra just hit all of my sweet spots.  (Proto-metal feel.  Concept album.  Just a touch of proggy goodness.  Folksy.  YESSSS.)

Cual estan los grupos de musica que me gustan?  What are some bands I would like?  (Feel free to correct my crappy Spanish.)"
"Any great Spanish-speaking metal bands I'm missing out on?","If you're into Mago, try listening to Saurom (formerly Saurom Lamderth). Pretty folky stuff, although I haven't listened to them since quite long ago so I don't know their newer albums. Still, I enjoyed them back then, I hope you do as well :)

I gravitated towards folk metal because I was tired of the evil/satanic/gimmicky themes in many forms of metal.  I really enjoy the usually light hearted and fun atmosphere that folk metal has.  Does anyone else have a similar experience?"
"Who is the band pictured at the top of this page?","It's Finntroll."
"Who is the band pictured at the top of this page?","I only think the banner is poorly designed because it shows only one band.

"Who is the band pictured at the top of this page?","""I'd like to see a band that is more representative of the values I find in folk metal""

While some bands may just be in for fun and giggles, it's very common that their members be keen on reconnecting with folk culture. The use of traditional instruments is only half of it and right off the bat, I can't think of a band with no lyrics referring to their native lore and history. What you see in the picture is exactly that. These are core values in folk metal. 

It's very telling of the cultural cleansing we've been put through over the past centuries that you see ""evil/satanic themes"" when someone dresses up as a mythical creature. That's where ridiculousness lies to me. "
"Who is the band pictured at the top of this page?","I should have worded this differently and/or clarified better.  I do not see this pictures as being ""evil"" but I would fit it into the gimmicky area.  I really like Finntroll but just don't like this picture.  Just my opinion."
"Who is the band pictured at the top of this page?","You talk about the ""light hearted"" and ""fun"" atmosphere of Folk metal but then complain that they look silly.

If they were ""light hearted"" and ""fun"" wouldn't a comical look be fitting?  I totally disagree with the generalization of Folk metal as a light-hearted genre as many of my favorite bands I love because their music and lyrics convey their culture and atmosphere which is able to express deeper emotions; not because they occasionally sing drinking songs.

"Who is the band pictured at the top of this page?","I owe it more to a lazy mod. When he first posted it over a year ago he said he was going to change it every week to ""feature"" a different folk metal band.

"Folk metal in 2013","It's almost december so I thought we could do kind of discussion thread for albums that came out this year. Also to discuss gigs we've been to, news regarding our favourite bands and so on. 

Some questions to get it going:

* What album was the biggest disappointment for you **and why**? 

* What album did you enjoy the most **and why**?

* What new bands did you discover lately?

* What bands did you see live this year? How did you enjoy it?

Feel free to add more questions or just whatever that contributes to discussion. I really love folk metal and I like this subreddit but I don't like seeing just links or lists being posted without any discussion. Let's bring some life here!
"
"Folk metal in 2013","I was able to get myself to paganfest this year. Everyone there was amazing! Ensiferum, Heidvolk, trollfrest, Tyr, and hellsot brought it. I also managed to see wintersun during the summer. Those were probably the best tours that I came across (missed Finntroll due to school).

Probably the biggest disappointment I had with an album was Turisas2013. I really didn't enjoy most of the songs. BUT, I really enjoy Tyr's new album! With Eluveitie's album coming in maybe 2014 along with Time II, 2013 was an alright year for folk metal, but I look forward to a few more tours this next coming year hopefully!"
"Folk metal in 2013","I got lucky and got to see them all in Hollywood earlier this year when I just happened to be in that town. Tyr was awesome live IMO, can't wait to see them on their upcoming tour."
"Folk metal in 2013","You're a lucky guy. I've seen Ensiferum, Heidevolk and Týr already but I've yet to see Trollfest, which are definitely my favourite from all of the mentioned.

I agree with the disappointment. Turisas2013 is *alright* album, after few listens, but nothing great really. Probably their worst so far."
"Folk metal in 2013","Trollfest is pretty amazing live. I don't particularly like their music and still had a blast both times I saw them this year (Paganfest and when they opened for Alestorm)."
"Folk metal in 2013","Heidevolk is also having a new album next year, so 2014 is supposed to become a good year for folk metal!"
"Folk metal in 2013","Turisas2013 - huge disappointment. Concluded it would be a fun time live, but I can't stand listening through the album (With the exception of the track ""Greek Fire"").


A fair split between Finntroll's *Blodsvept* and Tyr's *Valkryja*. Both were fun, enjoyable album's to listen to.


I've been listening to *Fejd* and *Sig:Ar:Tyr*, both excellent folk styled bands that bring something interesting to the table. Fejd is more folky than metal, but is still really neat, and Sig:Ar:Tyr is more blackened epic folk, which sounds really awesome.

Went to Paganfest,  saw Finntroll and saw Wintersun. Paganfest was amazing - even more so this year, every band was perfect.

Finntroll was a riot of a time - almost went to see them again, but didn't have the time.

Wintersun was a blinding, reverberating mosh of colour and sound... and it was amazing. Absolutely amazing. 10/10 
"
"Folk metal in 2013","My biggest disappointment was actually *Blodsvept*. I love Finntroll and saw them live this year. The live show was amazing as always. But the newest album felt lacking. I can't quite say what it was but it feels a bit tired."
"Folk metal in 2013","The only folk metal album I got this year was Equilibrium's Waldschrein EP and it was fucking amazing. "
"Folk metal in 2013","Though underwhelming when you consider only 1 song was new...  Waldschrein is a great song but the EP was rather lackluster.  

The Skyrim cover had previously been posted by Equilibirum's guitarist on Youtube ages ago just as a fun thing he'd whipped up.  I thought the album one would be different, but it was exact same just looped twice.  

Zwergenhammer has some nice parts but isn't amazing like Equilibirum's newer stuff and Der Sturm was never a song I particularly liked anyway, so redoing it held no interest for me.  

I mean Waldschrein was so good that it makes up for the inadequacy of the other songs and I'm definitely excited for the new album."
"Folk metal in 2013","hey, to each their own. I'm all about the folky melodies so Zwergenhammer was great, I've always loved the Skyrim theme so it was impossible to not like it, Der Sturm was one of my favorites off their first album and Waldschrein got me really excited for their new album. I feel and sound like a bit of a Fanboy, but I really did like the EP."
"Folk metal in 2013","Well that's the thing... I think Zwergenhammer over all has a weaker folk feel than their newer Sagas+ material.  

The Skyrim theme is great, just disappointing when I realised I'd already heard it before and that they hadn't done anything new to it.  "
"Folk metal in 2013","Biggest disappointment - I'd say Turisas2013 as well. I didn't really expect much as I''ve never been a big fan, but as they were playing on Paganfest and I got to see them for the first time I decided to give them a chance. Sadly they couldn't change my mind.

Best album - probably Falkenbach's Asa or Týr's Valkyrja. But my actual favorite is Arkona's live album, because it is basically a best of with newly arranged songs including choir and strings. Best part is - it's 3CDs with 36 songs and over 3h playtime.

New bands - I discover new bands on an almost daily basis, but one I especially started to like is the polish band Stworz, or at least their 2010 album.

Bands I saw live - a lot. Seriously, I've been to so many shows and festival this year as never before (mostly black and folk metal). Here are the folk metal bands I've seen: Korpiklaani 2x, Metsatöll, Avven, Niburta, Wolfchant 2x, Arkona 2x (+3x in December), Thyrfing, Bornholm, Alestorm 2x, Varg, Agalloch, Heathen Foray 3x, Finsterforst, Obscurity, Eluveitie, Ensiferum 2x, Orphaned Land 2x, Saltatio Mortis, Feuerschwanz, Solstafir, Haggard, Odraedir, Knaat 2x, Týr, Finntroll 2x, Equilibrium, Suidakra, Turisas, Frosttide, In Extremo.

My favorite shows/festivals were definitely Heidenfest (because I had the chance to spend some time with Arkona) as well as Runen der Nacht (a new small festival in Upper Austria - Finsterforst were absolutely brilliant live!). Summer Breeze was awesome as well (again, met Arkona:), Paganfest also never disappoints. The Finntroll headline show probably was a small highlight for me, I never really got into their albums but they were a blast live. And now I'm especially looking forward to the three Arkona+Therion shows in December (yea, I'm kind of a freak)."
"Folk metal in 2013","1. It has to be Bloodsvept. Even though it was a good album, it was quite underwhelming in my opinion.
2. Not sure
3. Vallorch, Wolfchant, Waylander
5. N/A"
"Folk metal in 2013","I went to Paganfest this year. Wasn't a huge fan of the line up this year but I really liked Heidvolk. "
"Folk metal in 2013","Orphaned Land's *All Is One* was my greatest disappointment of 2013, along with Turisas2013."
"Folk metal in 2013","Biggest disappointment? I listened to maybe two songs off Turisas2013 and decided that was the end of that. But I don't know if it was necessarily a disappointment because after the steaming pile of shit that was 'Stand Up and Fight', I didn't have any hopes for the album being better than a 2/10.

As far as 'best album', I'm probably going to go with Tyr's 'Valkyrja' as well. This was a relatively down year for folk metal though. Manegarm, Wolfchant, and Minotaurus all came out with pretty terrible albums too :-(

Haven't discovered a ton of new bands this year; guess I'm falling off.

Relatively down year in shows for me as well. Live bands I saw this year:

* Arkona (2x)
* Die Apokalyptischen Reiter
* Ensiferum (3x)
* Finntroll
* Heidevolk (3x)
* Helsott
* Metsatoll
* Subway to Sally
* Trollfest
* Turisas (2x)
* Tyr (4x)

Everyone was pretty solid, less Trollfest and Turisas. I'll be avoiding them if I can in the future."
"Folk metal in 2013","Trollfest is a great band. Though I didn't like them at first as well, but I've grown to love them. Their music is really original and fun, perfect as a background to drinking. "

"What are your favorite tavern/drinking songs ?","That would include most of Korpiklaani's discography, but also songs like Alestorm's [Nancy the Tavern Wench](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edOMZE3LEE0), Fangorn's [Taverna Trollja Nora](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM537mPC7PI), Finntroll's [Trollhammaren](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGywo81G6lk), Turisas' [One More](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVfP2VtXz1s), Northland's [The Old Town's Inn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QVAE9mksZU), Equilibrium's [Met](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao2aEV0JN3k), Vogelfrey's [Schuld ist nur der Met](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8rp0IqAELU), or Ensiferum's [Twilight Tavern](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaqqsTVuCnI).

In the teaser video you can definitely see a glimpse of the woman, so i was wracking my brain trying to think of any folk metal bands i knew of that had a female violin player.

* [Arkona - Yav](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT9DlXAONEw)

So completely different than their previous releases, with a less folky and more progressive approach that probably needs a few listens to sink in.

* [Stworz - Cóż po żyznych ziemiach​.​.​.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjE_kVvK04w)

"Best albums of 2014","My number one is easily Origins by Eluveitie. There are no other folk metal bands that really sound anything like Eluveitie and in my opinion, they get better with every album. 

I've been listening to them since Spirit and over the years I've watched them lose some of their folk sound in favor of heavier and more technical guitar and drum work and I did love old and new Eluveitie.

Origins really is the most fitting name for this album because they really found a perfect balance between old and new. It's their most folk sounding album since Slania (Not counting Evocation) but it's also their heaviest and most technical album yet."

"I lucked out","So today I walked into my go-to store for second-hand CDs and saw a huge pile of CDs on the counter. I asked the owner about it and he said someone had brought in their old CDs (apparently collecting vinyls means you don't want CDs anymore). HOWEVER he hadn't had time to organize them and said I could grab what I wanted for 3€ each.  
  
[This is my haul](http://imgur.com/tKqbYQ7) (only the folk stuff). I considered also buying the ones I already had and try to resell, but this way maybe someone else will discover the wonder that is folk metal :D"

"I lucked out","I consider myself a CD collector. I've been building my collection the last 15 years.  
  
I like having something physical to relate to, and the booklets which contain lyrics and artwork (and sometimes history) are nice to leaf through. As for why I don't collect vinyls... well I started in the dark ages of vinyl when they had just gone out of style and weren't retro yet."
"I lucked out","you can also get a physical copy autographed should you chance to meet any of the parties involved"

However, I usually get my concert ticket signed if I meet the artist. Then again the jewel case makes for excellent storage of signed concert tickets"

"What other bands have the likeness and atmosphere of Tyr?","I've been listening to about 10 or so discographies of different power/folk/viking metal bands over the past few months, and the one that stood out to me the most (and is now my favorite band) was Tyr.  They have an amazing way of putting their music together and making it seem symphonic with layered vocals.  Are there any other folk metal bands that do the same? I ask because I'm not into the screaming of most folk-metal.  It's too harsh for the grace of the melodies IMO.  I found a few that I may like already throug ht he folk metal wiki page; Triddana, Huldre, glittertind, Borknagar, and grindavisan, but they're not 100% spot on for what I really like.  So really, any suggestions?

Tl;dr: I like tyr's sound and how they don't scream to keep the melody in tact. More bands like this?"
"What other bands have the likeness and atmosphere of Tyr?","Forgive me, I'm on mobile. I would recommend Turisas and Korpiklaani off the top of my head and suggest you check out this page: [Metal Archives: Bands similar to Tyr](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Týr/14435)"

"What other bands have the likeness and atmosphere of Tyr?","There's a Latvian ""pagan/folk"" band called Skyforger that has some of the similar traditional chanting songs.

Those which aren't ""traditional"" are pretty intense black metal - so their discography may not be for you - but some of their stuff (i.e. - [Long I Heard, Now I See](http://youtu.be/EOVdrggsh2o)) could've been written by Tyr."

More dates will be added with Korpiklaani touring with TrollfesT in the USA without Ensiferum. 
"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Of course no dates anywhere in the southern part of the US."
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","I'm starting to really wonder what is going on with this.  Many tours like this have just completely ignored the south for the past few years. Do you think this is a decision by the bands or the promoters?"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","probably just a money thing, they think they wont sell enough tickets in the south or something."
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Story time. 

The last time Ensiferum came through Texas it was roughly 4-5 years ago in a tour with Fintroll. I live in S.A. and of course there wasn't a tour date here but there was one in Austin. Ok awesome slight road trip. Well it was February and as it often does in February in Texas, there was a slight ice storm the night before. I thought, ""no big deal, these warriors from the north should shrug at this slight ice  when compared to their homeland"". NOPE. Show cancelled. Fuck. Havent come around since. "
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","According to Korpiklaani website,  they are going to add more dates but without Ensiferum. Korpiklaani with TrollfesT. Will update around April. Hopefully the south gets more love"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","This sucks man. :("
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Dammit Texas..."
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Fuck yes. Going to see Kamelot/Dragonforce on May 12 and now Ensiferum the next night? This is just great. (Edmonton)

If only it wasn't at Union! haha"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Haha nice, same here except they are much further spaced apart. Great month, with Kamelot to kick things off, Faith No More in middle and this to end it with. Very excited. "
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Wow! Would you look at that complete lack of southern locations!"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","NO FUCKING WAY! Thank you for posting this! Tickets already come out on Friday for the Chicago show, and I would have missed it had I not have seen this post. 

I can finally see Korpiklaani in person!! :D"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","No problem, I was just as excited as you. New albums from both headliner bands and Trollfest are always amazing fun, it will be a great show. "
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Do you expect them to play only stuff from their new albums or older songs as well?"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","They will most definitely play their older stuff, plenty of time for all the good stuff"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Fantastic, looking forward to it."
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","I guess this is good since there will be no pagan fest this year in the USA."
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Definitely. "
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","I cant find any mention of the cleveland visit anywhere. Its not on ticketstub ticket master or the Agora Theatres website. :("
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","It's up on the Agora site now, link leads to [here for tickets.](http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=5686285)"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Of course when a tour actually comes through Nebraska it's a week after classes end and I go back home."
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Hmm, so I guess I have till May to REALLY get into Ensiferum and Korpiklaani. As someone who isn't too familiar with their work, is there anybody who wants to give me a few suggestions of where to start? I like what I know of these bands, and this would be an awesome show for me to go to."
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","I don't know much about Enisferum, but as for Korpiklaani, I can give you some of my favorites:

[Wooden Pints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoRUpKnaOHs)

[Keep on Galloping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aENHuVhBoz8)

[Hunting Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x26u6t4jaY)

[Korpiklaani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoaLUHmfSp4)"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Korpiklaani I don't tend to care too much for their Finnish lyric songs, but here's a list of my favourite:

""Brings Us Pints Of Beer"" was my first song and still my favourite
""Vodka"" is another fun song and popular
""Rauta"" is their most popular song I think. It's Finnish but very catchy. There is an English version if it that I recommend avoiding 
Under the Sun
Tequila
Happy Little Boozer
Ievan Polkka (also Finnish but catchy, again, avoid English version)

They're a very party / fun band.

Ensiferum is more about battle and Viking stuff. I'm not as familiar with those but here are my most memorable:

Wanderer (somewhat different than some of the others, probably my favourite)
In My Sword I Trust
Victory Song
Battle Song
Sword Chant
 
(See the theme? :p)"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Fuck, I'll probably be in a shithole in the middle of nowhere when this comes close enough!"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Wait there is a PaganfestXL im going to next month in The Netherlands. It's got Korpiklaani,  Turisas, Heidevolk, Wintersun and some more.

What do you mean no Paganfest?"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","No Paganfest in USA this year. I've been going to them for years but this year they aren't doing one over here. "
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","I wonder if there's a relation to the canceled Paganfest and this tour. Like did they decide to go anyway? Or was it canceled because of this tour?

I was heartbroken to hear there was no Paganfest this year but this definitely makes up for it."
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Okay yeah we didnt have one last year but do have one this year."
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Nope they announced on their Facebook page that there will be no 2015 Paganfest America. "
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Netherlands DOES have a Paganfest this year.

"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","I did specify The Netherlands, though."
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Sweet, I can make it to the SF show!"
"Ensiferum, Korpiklaani w/ Trollfest 2015 USA/Canada Tour!!","Fuck man, I really want to see this but why is there no Detroit show?! Several hours in any direction for me... And a newborn at home makes any overnight trips difficult :("

"Folk/Metal Instrumentals","I'm looking for some more folk and folk metal music without vocals. I've got a lot of music by Gwendal and Flook (two great folk bands) and have Equilibriums discography which contains some.amazing instrumental tunes.

"TYR live Opening for Children of Bodom 03 14 2014","They need a better volume level on the mic... And that fake voice echo... Love Týr, but that was kind of sad they got that treatment.

Just discovered Týr and folk/viking metal. Completely love it. Which is weird as I'm a christian and so much of the genre is so anti-christian lol. Great music is great music though."

"Ensiferum - Heathen Horde (New song)","I was going to say the same thing.  I was tempted to just stop the song a minute in because it was nothing new at all.

That being said, I did enjoy the chorus and that made the song a lot more enjoyable.  

The problem is the intro could literally lead into *soooooo* many different Ensiferum songs.  The one that came to mind was ""Unsung Heroes"" which has a very similar intro.  

I mean, I like the songs, but it's exactly what I expected and to that extent it's not all that exciting."
"Ensiferum - Heathen Horde (New song)","It's definitely a lot better than Unsung Heroes though. I enjoyed this, which is more than I can say for most of their last album"

Hear the thunder drums,

Vocals are fantastic,

[9:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZuzKab9d2M&amp;t=9m4s) on to the end of the song is an *incredibly* obvious and frankly **embarrassing** ripoff of the end of [Jumalten Kaupunki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zow8P7kfYpM&amp;t=7m57s)
 
Moonsorrow song titles link to the specific section of the song being referred to."
"Finsterforst - Urquell","Some of these hvae slight rythmic similarities and others are in no way similar. All you are hearing is often the key of c. I dont agree with any of it. Especially the one you say is ""embarassingly plagarized"" at 9:50 something or whatever the blither. 

Point is, both bands heavily use c major, g major, and a harmonic minor. Many folky bands do"
"Finsterforst - Urquell","It clearly goes beyond similar keys and having simple rhythms in common. This isn't the only Finterforst song that sounds like it has a lot of Moonsorrow melodies and riffs put into it, in fact the only reason I had heard about Finterforst was because so many people complained about it ripping off Moonsorrow, including the band itself."
"Finsterforst - Urquell","This might not be true with their latest album which I think is quite a bit better than their earlier work."
"Finsterforst - Urquell","I don't know what songs are on the newest album but I know the main songwriter of Moonsorrow posted a finterforst song to twitter a couple months ago that he thought was ripping them off. I don't know if that being recent means it's off the new album."
"Finsterforst - Urquell","Sounds like people are saying that the new album is a rip off of Moonsorrow. I couldn't say I agree. I would take that as a compliment and say that is reason enough to give it a listen. "
"Finsterforst - Urquell","They sound a lot like Moonsorrow, so there is clearly an inspiration but I wouldn't call it rip off. I like both bands."

"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","He isn't in anyway AGAINST metal, but I think he is still a little scared of it.  He listens to Panic At the Disco and Imagine Dragons and stuff in that pop category.  I think as a big fantasy nerd he could get into folk metal, but I'd need something without heavy vocals or any overly intense passages."
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","As a fellow fantasy geek and folk music fab who took a long time to appreciate any metal, steer away from Folk Metal. Its kinda different to most of what is appealing about Folk music. If you do want to try Folk Metal though, try Korpiklaani. If he's big on fantasy stuff, try things like Avantasia, Dragonland or Rhapsody of Fire. Pretty regular ""armies of goodness against indominatable evil, heroes on quests"" sort of power metally stuff."

"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","Ayyyyy"

"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","Thanks a ton, I think power metal is a better place to start, and those bands seem up his alley."
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","The Varangian Way by Turisas straddles the line between power metal and folk, and is also a 10 out of 10 album, you could try that."
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","Maybe Heidevolk? It's got smooth vocals and good folksie quality. 

And as a big fantasy nerd, I'd recommend Nightwish for sure (older Tarja stuff to start with, but the newer stuff too - Imaginarium is pretty poppy). 

"
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","Eluveitie's Arcane Dominion I album. Its acoustic but its a good introduction to some of their stuff. At least it's how I started ."
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","Maybe folky power metal, like Lyriel?   I personally go for Haggard, but a lot of folk-metal bands have a lot of growling, and that might put off someone coming in new.  "
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","Ensiferum! Viking, very melodic."
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","The Varanigian Way album by Turisas "
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","Skyclad, Mago de Oz, Tuatha de Danann, etc. 

Bands that incorporate a bit more folk than all the other suggestions you're going to get here."
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","Sorry I'm so late to the party. If your friend is looking for something without heavy vocals I would first suggest the albums Turisas2013 (not their best imo but there's not much heavy vocals) and Stand Up and Fight by Turisas. Also I would suggest the songs Wanderer, Lady in Black (Uriah Heep cover), Lai Lai Hei by Ensiferum and the song One More by Turisas. If he likes those songs maybe the heavier songs by Ensiferum and Turisas will grow on him. 

It wouldn't be a bad idea to show him some Týr as well. "
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","I was introduced to it with Eluveitie's ""Slania's Song."" It has a really heavy folk feel with metal that's not overpowering. And, the fact that it's in Gaulish should satisfy his nerdy side."
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","http://folkmetalradio.playtheradio.com/ - show him this radio.

They just play various kinds of folk metal, from different sides of this genre, tell him to make notes of bands that he like. Thats it.

Also: Eluveitie is my bet ;)"
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","Yeah I played him Call of the Mountain ('cause clean vocals) he liked it!"
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","I want to say Troll Gnet El but I don't know if it's heavy enough. They certainly have got the folk elements and are damn good, even if they do sing in Russian. :)"
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","Triddana! Classic metal, bagpipes, flute and a singer that's basically RJ Dio v2.0"
"I want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?","I really want to recommend Moonsorrow, but they've moved over to the black side of the spectrum, and it might be too hard for a guy getting his feet wet.  I think that [Raunioilla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtEIb6sX6Xs) would be a good jumping off point.  "

Finsterforst may not be re-inventing the wheel with their albums, but they've definitely perfected their sound and the result is fantastic to listen to."

"[discussion] Now that it's been out for a few days, can we talk about Erdentempel?","just a general discussion for the album. My favorite tracks are Uns'rer Flöten Klang, Waldschrein, Heavy Chill, Wirtshaus Gaudi and Wellengang. Aufbruch is a good instrumental (though nowhere near the others) and I love that they released a second copy of just instrumentals. It also seemed like a much happier sounding record."
"[discussion] Now that it's been out for a few days, can we talk about Erdentempel?","Fucking great. Nuff said."
"[discussion] Now that it's been out for a few days, can we talk about Erdentempel?","Best summer metal avaiable!"

"[discussion] Now that it's been out for a few days, can we talk about Erdentempel?","Uns'rer Flöten Klang wins the entire album for me. The album as a whole is definitely more folky than Rekreatur, both are great but this one was a lot better than I had anticipated. "

"[discussion] Now that it's been out for a few days, can we talk about Erdentempel?","from the album? I'd say Wirtshaus Gaudi, Waldschrein, Heavy Chill or Stein Meiner Ahnen. No one said you had to like it."
"[discussion] Now that it's been out for a few days, can we talk about Erdentempel?","Thanks for the recommendations!  I made my comment primarily because I was curious why people were gravitating towards that song specifically."
"[discussion] Now that it's been out for a few days, can we talk about Erdentempel?","I personally love it because it sounds very similar to Irish folk music which is something I listen too all the time. I'm all about those fast and folky melodies, especially the second half of it."

"Verjnuarmu - laalavat jouset (singing bows)","Just for fun I try to translate because i Think the lyrics are fun (but that is just probaly because i'm not from Savo and think that they are a bunch of pussies):

A bunch of men in grey is coming from the woods
quivers filled with death
Heavy boots stomp the land and fill the world around with hate and dread
Dismal songs ring around as
Every man on the company sing like it is the last day of earth.
Land slaves look at them bewildered because they all sing so wrong
Still i think you won't live to see another morning after you have faced the company of Savo's Bows

If you stand against them their bows will sing the song of death. 
With a thousand players you have no chance, The sky is filled from black arrows.
Wifes are crying from the fear of death, Deathfear!

Thousands of enemies die and fall the whole land is filled in black arrows, blood and bowels.

Arrow comes after an arrow and the day becomes a night in their shadow. 
The enemy will suffer hell on earth as living becomes the hardest of thing they have ever encountered before.
Some of them have arrow in the eye and two fucking ones in their beard, I wonder who could survive. Few are the men who face them and even they run, those who are wounded are ready to die.

"So whats everyone's thoughts on the new Tyr album?","I like it. I dont know if its their best album, but it has some very fantastic songs on there. 

My favorite songs are so far Blood of Heroes (one of my two favorites so far), Another Fallen Brother,  Into the Sky, Fánar Burtur Brandaljóð, Lady of the Slain (my other favorite), and Valkyrja. 

Notable mentions are the two covers that they did, really a top notch job! "
"So whats everyone's thoughts on the new Tyr album?","I think Tyr made a great Tyr album. It wasn't a stretch like The Lay of Thrym, influenced more by current events than the past and losing Tyr's progressive style more and more. In Heri's own words, Tyr have been becoming a little more mainstream with each album, explaining why many of the songs on The Lay of Thrym were meant for newer fans more than older. As an older fan, I was not so impressed by The Lay of Thrym--don't get me wrong, it wasn't a terrible album, just not their best. While I don't think Valkyrja is their best, I still see more of older Tyr in it than Thrym. It's a good old fashioned, epic Tyr concept album, following the epic story of a man who leave's his life behind to die gloriously in battle. In many of the songs, you hear both slower progressive parts and a faster, heavier melodic parts, appeasing both old and new fans simultaneously. I love this album!"
"So whats everyone's thoughts on the new Tyr album?","I really loved Grindavísan, Another Fallen Brother, Hel Hath No Fury and Lady of the Slain. The cover of Cemetery Gates was pretty fun too. 

Overall, I found it to be on about the same level of Lay of Thrym- didn't disappoint, didn't blow me away. As far as new albums go, it was a success. Definitely worth the purchase."
"So whats everyone's thoughts on the new Tyr album?","This is definitely not quite on topic, but I'd rather put it here than start a whole thread for it.

I am *extremely* into Folk Metal, hence why I'm subscribed to this subreddit, as I'm sure all of you are.  I love all the same stuff the Folk Metal community loves for the most part, but I've never been able to get into Tyr for some reason.  Same with Turisas.  I don't see much hope for me ever liking Turisas, but I definitely think I could be into some of Tyr's stuff.  Can someone recommend me some songs of theirs similar to Ramund hin Unge?  I really love that style, but I haven't been through their whole discography, since I'm turned off by the majority of their stuff.  I checked out the single from the new album when it came out, and wanted to force myself to like it since so many of you guys do, but I just wasn't too impressed.  It just seems strange to me that the people who love all the same stuff I do are really into a band that I feel like I just don't get.  I'd love if someone could help me out by pointing to me to some of their best songs!  Thanks."
"So whats everyone's thoughts on the new Tyr album?","Get yourself Eric the Red. It is my favourite album of theirs by a long stretch. Songs like that one, and especially [Regin Smidur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8klzhW6DVE) are what got me into the band. Honestly: I don't know how many times I've watched the video for that song on loop. Not only did it sell me on Tyr, but also on Folk Metal as a whole. (I clicked the link off a Korpiklaani video and it change my world)"
"So whats everyone's thoughts on the new Tyr album?","Try [The Lay of Thrym](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itZPFAc7CIA) I share the same sentiments as you and this is the one song by them I've been able to get into. It's fucking awesome"
"So whats everyone's thoughts on the new Tyr album?","Well I'm similar in that I really haven't been able to understand this band's appeal. I really really try to like them but the music just doesn't engage me. Their live performance was very enjoyable but other than that, I just can't say I get it. 


Though, I am different from you in the fact that I like Turisas. "
"So whats everyone's thoughts on the new Tyr album?","I can see how they'd be a lot of fun live.  I just don't see anything too special or original about them.

And what Turisas songs would you recommend?  I like a couple, but it seems bland to me for the most part.  I saw them live with Arkona and Alestorm on Paganfest a couple years back, but I just wasn't into it.  I caught the rag he used to wipe his facepaint on though.  That was cool.  I gave it to the dude next to me who was a huge fan.  He had his face painted and yelled all the words to every song.  He gave me a hug, haha.  Good ol' metalhead brotherhood."
"So whats everyone's thoughts on the new Tyr album?","Well, there's the classic [To Holmgard and Beyond](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFBIr3Vx16w). Some of my other favourites are [Hunting Pirates](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFBIr3Vx16w) and [In The Court of Jarisleif.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K8SP-xoQiY) I don't know, I just get a really unique vibe from these guys. They're not my favourite band by any means but bland would be the last word I'd use to describe them (though I wouldn't hesitate to use it describe Tyr). 

Edit: Don't waste your time with Turisas2013."
"So whats everyone's thoughts on the new Tyr album?","Hey, I love Progmetal, but do not like Dream Theatre, BTBAM, or Protest the Hero. Sometimes your ears are going to disagree with the majority, but thats okay."
"So whats everyone's thoughts on the new Tyr album?","Only liked a handful of Tyr's stuff before, but I like more or less every song off the entire album. I know saying this is sacrilege in metal but I think moving towards a more catchy mainstream sound helped them. A lot of the songs are just solid headbangers and I think a lot of their older stuff suffered from being overly proggy - I just couldn't get into it."
"So whats everyone's thoughts on the new Tyr album?","Surprisingly i already have four songs stuck in my head on my second listen, which is pretty good.  I REALLY like nation though, because, like The Edge, it shifts from english to faroese which makes me happy."

"Need workout viking metal. Not just your favorite songs on average. But a real pump up playlist for compound lifting.","My suggestions:

Tyr - Shadow of the Swastika
Ensiferum - One more magic potion
Turisas - Portage to the Unknown
Amon Amarth - Guardians of Asgaard

And not viking metal but Born in a Mourning Hall by Blind Guardian is a really good fast song."
"Need workout viking metal. Not just your favorite songs on average. But a real pump up playlist for compound lifting.","Within Temptation, Leaves Eyes, and Delain are worth checking out, but I wouldn't say very many of their songs are ""pump up."" 

I second Heidevolk. 

Therion would be good to check out, particularly ""Gothic Kabbalah."" 

Sabaton and Powerwolf go surprisingly well with those bands, and are extremely good for work-out, but it is power metal, not viking or folk.

"Need workout viking metal. Not just your favorite songs on average. But a real pump up playlist for compound lifting.","Possibly because Amon Amarth isn't viking metal"
"Need workout viking metal. Not just your favorite songs on average. But a real pump up playlist for compound lifting.","Actually it's the very definition of it. Viking themed metal. ""Viking"" is not a musical aesthetic. So yes, they absolutely are."
"Need workout viking metal. Not just your favorite songs on average. But a real pump up playlist for compound lifting.","That's not really how I understand it. I understand viking metal as being a fusion between folk and black metal with lyrical themes surrounding vikings and such. Considering that definition Amon Amarth is clearly not viking metal. But that's just my interpretation of it so I respectfully disagree with you..."
"Need workout viking metal. Not just your favorite songs on average. But a real pump up playlist for compound lifting.","There is this stupid thing where there are a lot of bands that have a different sound than Amon Amarth (Black Metal influences, mainly) that sing about Viking stuff too, and because they came first, they got to define Viking Metal. Amon Amarth sings viking themed lyrics, but musically they're a form of Death Metal or Melodeath, not Black metal. "

"Alan Stivell - Tri Martolod (sounds almost EXACTLY like Eluveite's Inis Mona, recorded 1972 Celtic folk song)","That's actually a Breton traditional song. Eluveitie use TONS of traditional tunes in their albums, specially Breton and Irish tunes (as far as I can tell). And this is actually the main reason why I enjoy this band so much.

Some other examples:

[La Jument de Michao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ntk_4yHuPg) --&gt; [Luxtos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pdGLsFjRSM)

Does anyone happen to know the tune from the [Epilogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAse_w6OWnI) on ""Helvetios""?  It's a favorite of mine. 
"
"Alan Stivell - Tri Martolod (sounds almost EXACTLY like Eluveite's Inis Mona, recorded 1972 Celtic folk song)","I don't know which is the tune from *Epilogue*. There's a thread in [Eluveitie's website forum](http://eluveitie.ch/forum/) where its users compile the tunes used by the band, I looked it up but I didn't find out anything there about that tune in particular. If you are really desperate to know, I guess you can try and ask there."
"Alan Stivell - Tri Martolod (sounds almost EXACTLY like Eluveite's Inis Mona, recorded 1972 Celtic folk song)","Yup, same melody. Lots of folk metal musicians use really, really old melodies that have existed for a long time. I don't mind it as long as the artistic integrity is still respected. Similar melodies can also be found in the intro of [Rose for Epona - Eluveitie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z89WI96MzZc) and [Metropolice - Blood Stain Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQhRS-4NXiE)"
"Alan Stivell - Tri Martolod (sounds almost EXACTLY like Eluveite's Inis Mona, recorded 1972 Celtic folk song)","Thanks, yeah, I didn't mean to imply I hate them because of it or anything. That seems to be the whole point of folk metal - translating traditional folk music to something modern without losing the accessibility and catchiness. I was just surprised by the fact that I didn't read about this in any review/interview etc."
"Alan Stivell - Tri Martolod (sounds almost EXACTLY like Eluveite's Inis Mona, recorded 1972 Celtic folk song)","My favourite is the version done by Tri Yann - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFzeozt7ynU"

"Is there a subreddit for bands that are folky but not as heavy, like Faun?","Faun is one of my favorite bands of all time!  Check out /r/neofolk.  I've been subbed there for nearly a year, and seen maybe 6 or 7 posts, hahaha.  It's still neat to see something come up every once in awhile though.  And if you like Faun, check out Gjallarhorn.  Their song I riden sa is one of my favorites.  Also check out Irfan, The Moon and the Nightspirit, **Omnia**, Daemonia Nymphe, Estampie, Almara, and Branâ Keternâ.

"recommendations for bands like Skalmold?","And Solstafir, Kvelertak - ok so those two aren't exactly folk metal but the three have a vibe I really dig.

I love me some Eluveitie, Korpiklaani etc, but i'd love to expand my 'in the zone' metal playlist to beyond just three bands :)
"
"recommendations for bands like Skalmold?","If you haven't heard of Metsatoll, check them out, but they're pretty popular so you probably have.  

Falkenbach is in a similar vein, as it's essentially folk black with clean vocals.  XIV Dark Centuries is pretty good, very folky black metal with kinda the same vibe as Skalmold.  

I also like King of Asgard, they're pretty typical viking black metal, as well as Abinchova, which is similar except way more folky.  

Einherjer has a similar vibe instrumentally, but the vocals are very different.  That's all I can think of right now."
"recommendations for bands like Skalmold?","Heidevolk and Svartsot too."
"recommendations for bands like Skalmold?","There is a spotify list where people add different folk bands. There are tons of different bands on it.  I can't link it atm as i am on mobile but it is called ""folk metal"""

"recommendations for bands like Skalmold?","My English (US) keyboard and keyboard layout do not prevent me from typing Skálmöld (or Sólstafir).  Part of enjoying folk metal for me is respecting other cultures and languages.  Fascinating for me, not as much for others.

Anyway, search Encyclopaedia Metallum or something and copy/paste from there, probably the easiest."
"recommendations for bands like Skalmold?","Of course it is great if you get the names right, and it is as you say a way of treating different languages with respect. Still, I often find myself just writing out e.g. Negura Bunget out of laziness, instead of going to some webpage and copy-pasting the correct spelling. It does take a bit more effort."
"recommendations for bands like Skalmold?","Absolutely right but no need to be so harsh about it. I usually do write Icelandic names properly."

"Looking for suggestions","Hey guys, so I was wondering mostly if there were any folk metal bands out there that feature something more technical- instrument wise. I just recently started getting into Viking/Folk metal bands (Ensiferum etc.) and I'm now looking for folk metal but with a more technical/complex style! Any suggestions are well appreciated, thanks!"
"Looking for suggestions","You may want to start with Arkona (rus)"
"Looking for suggestions","I listened to them, not bad, but not exactly what I'm looking for. I had previously listened to Tyr, wasn't getting into it, and I just recently started liking them a lot. I guess I could've phrased it better, what I was looking for was progressive folk/viking metal, but thank you for the suggestion, I appreciate it! "
"Looking for suggestions","You might enjoy some Suidakra. I'm using a POS computer so I can't go find any links right now, but look into some of their newer stuff. The songs Defiant Dreams and Pair Daedeni are pretty technical but they aren't exactly viking metal. They're a German pagan band and the album those two songs are on is written about Roman history.

Also, Folkstone, Enslaved and Borknagar might come pretty close to what you're looking for."
"Looking for suggestions","Will check them out, thanks! "
"Looking for suggestions","You should check out Windir, especially their song, [Journey to the End](http://youtu.be/4DOPkHrW5bA). It has some really cool techo-synth stuff towards the middle/end."
"Looking for suggestions","Thank you, this is awesome!"
"Looking for suggestions","Tyr, Finntroll, Turisas, Moonsorrow all have a very strong technical element to their songs with irregular time signatures and interesting melodic layers.  

"
"Looking for suggestions","I hope that ""for my brother"", the game gets made, Machinae Supremacy has a history of making great video game music, now not very folkish, the game I mentioned is in a Celtic setting and the band will make Celtic SID metal as they call it themselves, which is a genre I never knew I needed.

"When does Folk Metal become Metal Folk? (poor title but it's the best I could think of)","I might be thinking too much into this but I wanted to get some others opinions on it.

Between Metal and Punk we have two main genres that take influences from both, Thrash Metal and Hardcore Punk (there's Crossover and a load of others as well but I thought I would simplify it for this discussion and go with the main two in my eyes). 

Thrash is Metal that took influence from Punk and Hardcore is Punk that took influence from Metal, both combined the same genres but focused on different sides of the coin and got two pretty distinct sounds.

Is there a similar thing in Folk Metal? A distinction between Folk bands influenced by Metal and Metal bands influenced by Folk? Most of the diversity in Folk Metal I've always put down to cultural causes and different bands take on the genre but could we, for instance take Turisas and Equilibrium and say Turisas is a metal band first and foremost adding in Folk elements while Equilibrium is more of a Folk band adding in Metal elements? I'm not overly familiar with much European Folk music outside of the Scottish stuff I was raised listening too so I'm not sure how true to German Folk music Equilibrium are. 

Can you think of any bands that might fall into the Folk first and foremost side of Folk Metal? Saor Patrol may be a band that falls into the fringe of this as they could possibly be better described as a Folk band with Rock influences than Metal.

Any input on this would be greatly appreciated, even if it's to say I'm thinking about this too much. Some times I need to here that. :)"
"When does Folk Metal become Metal Folk? (poor title but it's the best I could think of)","Fejd is the obvious example of a folk band with some metal influences. They don't use electric guitars, with a few exceptions. But they have quite heavy, metal inspired drums. And there is some metal influence in their melodies.

"Arkona - Yav (Preview) - Teaser for the new Album!","It's a kind of in-between of agressive/clear- like on Stenka na Stenku, and in parts on other songs (a little of Arkaim, Zaklyate, etc.)

Can hear it on Serbia, Yav, V obyatyakh kramoly, to a lesser extent on a couple other songs in that preview. It's definitely far from being bad, but I just prefer her other vocals.

"Contrary to Turisas, I'm a big fan of all of Eluveitie's branchings and experiments. Eluveitie - Lugdunon","I can't figure out if i like this or not. Overall, it's great, but i'm not the biggest fan of their ""softer stuff"" (ie A Rose for Epona) which is how the song starts, but then it goes to the verse which is awesome and slightly better than the chorus. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK. Still a fantastic song with a kick ass solo"
"Contrary to Turisas, I'm a big fan of all of Eluveitie's branchings and experiments. Eluveitie - Lugdunon","I've been a fan of both Turisas and Eluveitie for a number of years, and have developed my musical taste depending on both of these as founding bands in the ""folk metal"" genre. Enjoying both, for their similarities and differences. 

The new Turisas album (Turisas2013 (What a DREADFUL NAME)) is good, but not in the same way as their previous (pre- Stand Up and Fight) albums. It seems to me that they are taking a more Jazzy/more popular approach to metal, which is completely up to them, the band. However I don't think that by any means the new album is ""bad"", it's a well crafted band, with obvious influences from their previous work and draws upon their experience as an evolving band. 

Without upsetting too many, I think they are changing into a more mature band via a subtle progression through their most recent albums.

I've seen both bands live (And enjoyed both INCREDIBLY). This is definitely a different sound for Eluveitie, more folky rather than the modern sound of Turisas. But as each band develops, it allows for more variety and differentiation amongst each other, creating more variety for listeners. 

As we all know, Eluveitie does folk tunes very well. This song grabs the attention of those who enjoy their slower more peaceful songs, as well as those who enjoy the quit folk tunes. It's a good song and I am indeed enjoying both Turisas and Eluveitie's branching and experiments...broadening the horizons of Folk metal always seems like a good thing to me.

I am looking forward to the next Ensiferum album (a massive amount) and hoping for a full album from Equilibium soon (Not just an EP)...oh yeah, and Time II would be nice too from Wintersun. 

Currently waiting on my Turisas2013 album to arrive. Will possible post a lame review of it on the folk metal subreddit once I listen to it consistently for a few weeks, maybe. 

TLDR; Quite enjoy the new Turisas sound, this song is also pretty sweet. "
"Contrary to Turisas, I'm a big fan of all of Eluveitie's branchings and experiments. Eluveitie - Lugdunon","I do like Turisas' new album, but... well, not in the same way.  While this is clearly out of the ordinary for Eluveitie, considering their DM elements, it is still definitely Eluveitie.  Turisas' new sound is like they took SUAF and emptied it of all the Byzantine, Viking, and Folk from it.  It's no longer folk metal or Turisas to me.  So while I like it as an album, and as an individual work, it's no longer that good ol' Turisas we all know and love.

Edit: Also, 'Run, Bhang Eater, Run!' is quite possibly the worst song in Turisas' repertoire.

Edit 2: Still, Turisas2013 is growing on me..."
"Contrary to Turisas, I'm a big fan of all of Eluveitie's branchings and experiments. Eluveitie - Lugdunon","I agree, I don't think i can consider Turisas folk metal anymore. And I also really hated Unsung Heroes. I'm still looking forward to the next Ensiferum album, but I'm not getting excited about it. It's their only album I can't stand, hopefully it's a fluke and their next one will be good."
"Contrary to Turisas, I'm a big fan of all of Eluveitie's branchings and experiments. Eluveitie - Lugdunon","Probably because its still pretty clearly folk metal. Clear hurdy gurdy, heavy guitars, a bit of aggressive vocals. But yes pretty poppy huh. "
"Contrary to Turisas, I'm a big fan of all of Eluveitie's branchings and experiments. Eluveitie - Lugdunon","I really hated all but one song on Helvetios (A Rose for Epona was an abomination of a song), and felt really disappointed by it. I haven't heard much of the new Turisas as I've been unable to order the album, but I doubt it could let me down as much as Helvetios did. This isn't a case of me not liking the 'softer stuff' as Evocation I is my favourite album, but I was so gutted by the direction they went in. Turisas I am more hopeful about. I guess I'll see."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Ever since the announcement that the album would be called Turisas2013, almost everyone has had extremely negative expectations, which weren't helped at all by the release of For Your Own Good and Into the Free.  

Now that the album is out, I'm curious to hear what people actually think of the whole thing.  Personally, I like some of the songs a lot, but I think the album is generally lacking the spirit that made Varangian Way so great.

What do you guys think?"
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","I think it's fantastic. Definitely a grower like someone else mentioned. It's hard to put aside expectations and preconceived notions, especially for a bands fourth album, but if you can do that, the album truly shines. To me, this is the logical continuation of Battle Metal. The Varangian Way was totally different from Battle Metal, then Stand Up And Fight was a continuation of TVW stylistically and even partly thematically, and now I think Turisas2013 is what their second album would've been if TVW and SUAF had never happened, if that makes any sense. It's definitely ""out there"", but its out there in a refreshing way. I always felt like Mathias was using the folk element and the historical element as a metaphor for modern life. Like, ""Battle Metal"" itself, do you listen to it before you charge off into a literal battle and chop off heads? Probably not. You listen to it and apply those themes to your modern life. On SUAF, they started to drop the historical metaphor halfway, and it just came out strange to me. For example, on ""Fear The Fear"" they have the line that goes ""Bravery, As we've all seen on TV, Explosions and swords, Hot girls in reward"" which, in the context of all the folky and historical lyrics on most of the other tracks, just makes you scratch your head and say ""what the fucks going on here?"". The mixing of historical and modern wasn't the best idea. On Turisas2013, I feel like they dropped the metaphors 100%, and went for pure, unfiltered messages. Instead of hearing ""The Great Escape"" and applying what someone did hundreds of years ago to modern life, they went with ""Into The Free"", which has got to be one of the most relatable songs I've ever heard. Just think, you could apply that to any modern situation, quitting a job, graduating school, dumping a bad girl/boyfriend, anything. So instead of bogging everything down in history, which I'm sure comes with a lot of research for the authenticity, they skipped all that and went straight for the message. Anyway, I feel like I rambled enough here, I just thought I'd add my two cents about what I feel like the band was going for, since 4 out of 5 people I know who dislike the album but love Turisas simply ""don't get it"", it seems like."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Agree mostly, but have you seen their new video for [Ten More Miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhgsqSBHA6M)? While the lyrics aren't modern, the video's themes definitely are."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Exactly! That video pretty much shows what I feel they're going for. Take the historical trappings and apply it to modern society."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","I think it's their weakest album yet, but it's not bad. It's a grower though, as I've liked it more as I've listened to it more."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","I think I'm really only dissapointed in the album because of the masterpieces that were Battle Metal and The Varangian Way. Nonetheless, the album lacked the epicness of Mathias' past efforts and the songs are a bit cheesy, even for Turisas. As a whole, the album wasn't terrible, but I doubt I'll listen to it much more. Also, Olli could have gotten way more violin exposure on the album. I would still give almost anything to see/meet them again, and they will remain one of my favourite bands."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","They're certainly the best live band I've ever seen, their performances are spectacular.  Lol ""cheesy even for Turisas""."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Once you don't listen to ""For your own good"" and ""Run bhang"", it's not a bad album.  It's different, even fun at times.  I don't really dig the drums at all, though.  The beats are too undefined and punk-y for me to really get into.   

In all honesty, the album sound incomplete to me.  There were a lot of poor choices made, such as that whack background yeller in ""Into The Free"" and ""No Good Story...""  Mildly disappointed, hoping some other good folk metal albums come out this year ***looking at you, Tyr.***"
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","~~God~~ Odin I can't wait for Valkyrja."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","I still... **STILL ** hate the name of this album (which is no reason to dislike the album itself, *of course*). 

I've come to enjoy the album, it's not the Folk Metal that we've been used to in Battle Metal and The Verangian Way...and yes, the only reason I originally bought this album was to keep up to date with owning all the Turisas albums (as they are one of my favorite bands).

However, it's not a bad album, it's different and could in agreement with other comments, could do with more folky themes. But it's still definitely still Turisas..and for that, I'd still personally class this as an *above average* album in the world of music.  

Needs more epic, orchestral tunes in my opinion, more exposed individual instruments in which they excelled with in the early albums.
Thoroughly enjoy the album though, as a new concept, interested to see where they do go from here. \m/ "
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","""Nope... Sounds Dildos."" - Skwisgaar Skwigelf﻿

Turisas had that rare talent of taking metal and adding a generous sprinkling of epic to it. Now they're just trying to sound epic without the metal. It's like a fuck-ton of frosting without the actual cake. Yeah, we all like frosting but it has to go *on* something. Most of their new stuff since ""Varangian Way"" just sounds like rejected ""Lord of the Rings"" soundtracks."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","That's the danger in becoming a wildly popular headlining band after only one album.  People love Battle Metal and then loved Varangian Way, but they hadn't really established themselves yet."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Heh, yeah, and now they have to contend with all the 'oldskool' pricks who don't understand that as a band evolves, so does their music.
Ahh well, Devin Townsend's new stuff grew on me, maybe this will as well."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Amon Amarth has 9 amazing albums that are all practically the same.  I'm all for a band evolving, but I'm not going to continue supporting a band that evolves to the point where it's unrecognizable and not good anymore.  Not that Turisas has specifically done this."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","You may like [this](http://youtu.be/paFSKfPaz30) video then."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","I completely agree. I'm not one of those fans that hates when a band tries to add to their sound, but this isn't evolution. It's like Battle Metal and The Varangian Way were A steak dinner and the next two albums were the deuces dropped the next morning."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","It is certainly a step up from Stand Up And Fight, which was very lackluster compared to their first two albums, but the album has it's flaws. I felt like it could have been a lot more powerful if they had spent more time on songs like For Your Own Good. Overall though, it's a step in the right direction from Stand Up And Fight."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Stand Up and Fight is my favorite Turisas album. Why do you feel it's lackluster?"
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Battle Metal and The Varangian Way both had a real power to them. In Stand Up And Fight I felt like they were deliberately trying to decrease that. Stand Up And Fight had a few good songs, but overall it felt weaker than the first two."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","I like Turisas. I dislike the album.
The songs are okay. Not good, not bad."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","I love it. Not a song I didn't like. Took a few listens to get into, but I'm definitely a fan."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","I feel ya. Although I do find myself skipping 'Run, Bhang-Eater, Run!' a lot. It just felt like a much weaker ""In The Court Of Jarisleif"", and even though I'm twenty seven, the porno sounds in my headphones still make me uncomfortable. I hated when Manowar did it, I hated when White Zombie did it, I hate when Turisas does it.

"
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Yeah, I guess that would be my least favorite song. And the moaning was a turn-off for me. Felt completely unnecessary. But it's only a few seconds. Not nearly as bad as when Zombie did it. But that's probably the low point of the album. As such, I can't really complain."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","I entirely agree.  Sex noises pretty much relegate a song from ever being played in the car or out loud.  It's also probably the weakest song on the album as well."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","I dont like it that much. I do plan on writing a review on it so i can get a better perspective on it"
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Aside from the fiasco that is 'Run, Bhang-Eater, Run!' and the hyperspeed 'March of the Varangian Guard' chorus in 'No Good Story Ever Starts With Drinking Tea,' I think it's a pretty good album.  Not as good as their previous efforts, but still good.  Greek Fire has to be one of my favorite Turisas songs so far."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Greek Fire is really awesome, honestly though, I love the Alvin and the Chipmunks style Guards of Glory..."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Like people said before, it's definitely a grower. The problem I have with it though is that every song, even the ones that I think are the best off the album, has *one* part or sound or SOMETHING that just kills it for me. Like the weird ass yelling or moaning or sped up stuff, it just makes it something that isn't as listenable. "
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Like the softcore porn in Run Bhang Eater Run."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Yeah that pretty much murdered any chance the album had of being played out loud in my car"
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions."," It is great as an album, but strange as a Turisas album."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","I personally think ""The Varangian Way"" is their weakest album despite having some really good songs.  I personally enjoy the last two albums far more than the first two primarily because I felt the first two had a lot of hit and miss.  Some songs were great, but some were duds with constant ""symphonic pauses"" that killed any momentum the song had going for it.  

While many people hate ""For Your Own Good"" I actually really like it; but not as a folk metal song.  If you're looking for folk metal; you'll be disappointed but if you're a fan of bombastic symphonic metal with a good lather of power metal, I think ""FYOG"" holds up really well.  

It definitely grows on you."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","I can understand that.  I love some Turisas songs but I find I can't really listen through their whole albums.  They have a very peculiar style that I really crave on occasion, but I tire of fast."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","Personally I like it. It's very different but simply fun. I don't think it's to be taken to seriously, rather a bit (read very) tongue-in-cheek. Piece by Piece is also one of my favourite Turisas songs to date."
"Turisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.","I fucking hate this album. I hated most of Stand Up and Fight too. The Varangian Way was a master piece, this new shit sounds like they're trying to make radio music."

Watching this post in case any suggestions of bands I've not heard of :)"
"Bands similar to Equilibrium?","I think Equilibrium has a very unique sound, but I can give you some more bands with German lyrics and similar epicness: [Gernotshagen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqPfRU7HnwA), [Abinchova](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1xFc73-CB8), [Bifröst](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OSg_yRK6rQ), [Finsterforst](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1e5z1gagZY), [Ahnengrab](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLJ19qm9utY), [Wolfchant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2T7ym4RljI)"
"Bands similar to Equilibrium?","Closest I would say is either Falkenbach or Suidakra. Some of the early Moonsorrow also shares a similar sound, but for the most part Equilibirum is a unique band"

I got the feeling he was quite a timid guy, I got the chance to meet Korpi when I was in Australia and he was a pretty quiet guy off stage but really relaxed and down to earth. I had this little wooden pendant I made years back with the shaman logo on it and just carried it everywhere like a traveling charm because of the whole journey man thing, I had it at the gig and gave him it and he was really appreciative. I bumped into him after the gig and he was wearing it attached to his necklace(s) and I almost totally geeked out but managed to wait till he had went away before I almost lost it.

"Lagerstein: Dreaded Skies","Anyone else think the vocals sound quite odd at times?  Like some sort of unintentional vibrato ""bleeting?""

I mean obviously this reminds me of Alestorm, but the thing is, Alestorm isn't that original, just massively fun.  (I absolutely love how tongue in cheek they are: they know their music is a thematic joke!)  So when you take something that sounds like something that wasn't that unique to begin with, it ends up not being that impressive.

The question to ask is: why would I listen to this band over Alestorm or Swashbuckled?

There are decent instrumental ideas here, but the vocals aren't very good at it seems that his odd vibrato is his ""signature"" technique so if you don't like it, it's going to ruin all the other songs too."
"Lagerstein: Dreaded Skies","I loved your comment but I do enjoy the interesting vocal technique and would prefer these guys over Alestorm and Swashbuckled.

Anyone?"
"Nine Treasures - Sonsii","Anybody know where to buy the album?  I bought their first one but can't find this anywhere even though it came out last year."

"Alestorm - Magnetic North","Hey, just a question, but do you hang out after the shows when on tour? I'm gonna buy the LP online, but I'd like to take it with me to a show (Doornroosje) for autographs, and since it's such a hassle to take it with me, I just wanted to know if that would be worth it. "
"Alestorm - Magnetic North","they hang out during, after or before the show. certainly at gigs with multiple bands, only nowadays Chris is more sober at those moments.

"Metal with violin?","Asmegin's first album is excellent. Ne Obliviscaris is not folk, but definitely one of the best bands out there to use the violin as a major instrument. There are loads of bands that have at least a few violin driven songs. And there's of course symphonic metal, but I'm guessing that's not what you're looking for.

Edit: There are loads of german style folk metal/rock bands that feature the violin as a prominent instrument. Bands like Subway to Sally, Letzte Instanz, etc."

"Ensiferum - Cry for the Earth Bounds",""
"Ensiferum - Cry for the Earth Bounds","Every song on this new album has been amazing. Many tracks harder than usual which has been awesome. This is the most unique of the songs so far and this is EXACTLY the reason I love this band so much. Such a unique sound and mix of different elements. Amazing song. Love the different paces and vocals. Epic. "
"Ensiferum - Cry for the Earth Bounds","I've decided that since I pre-ordered the album, I'm not gonna listen to these Spotify releases (okay, so maybe I've listened to Axe of Judgement). but man, oh man, comments like these are really getting me pumped. because honestly, I was kinda disappointed with One Man Army and Heathen Horde. but it seems like the songs released as promos or singles or whatever are always really lame anyway. "
"Ensiferum - Cry for the Earth Bounds","Heathen Horde took a few listens to grow on me and I'm rather fond of it now.  One Man Army is still by far the weakest track released so far -- everything else has been excellent."
"Ensiferum - Cry for the Earth Bounds","That's awesome. And axe of judgment is fucking great. STRIKE!
I really like One Man Army, they go hard. 
Cry fo the Earth bound ... most unique Ensiferum song. So many different elements. Almost brings tears. I've loved almost every song by this band. I take it for what it is too. A lot of people complained about Unsung Heroes and I fucking loved it. No other band makes music like they do. Super unique sound and so god damn epic.  "

"What are your favorite places/websites to get folkish clothing?","I usually start in the forest. I get my cloak from the deer, fashion some jewelry out of rocks and antlers.

That, or I go Skyclad."
"What are your favorite places/websites to get folkish clothing?","*Skyclad*! I haven't been *skyclad* since the last time I drew down the moon. "
"What are your favorite places/websites to get folkish clothing?","What, you don't acquire them whilst attacking and pillaging villages? "
"What are your favorite places/websites to get folkish clothing?","Always pay the iron price."
"What are your favorite places/websites to get folkish clothing?","If you're looking for authenticly made clothes. Try your local renaissance faire. It's gonna be expensive but the quality and craftsmanship is amazing. "
"What are your favorite places/websites to get folkish clothing?","This. I've spent around $400 on my outfit and it's not finished yet but this shit is quality. It lasts forever, your grandkids will be able to wear it to the ren fest too."
"What are your favorite places/websites to get folkish clothing?","Usually in a storm with lots of lightning. I love lightning; it's my best invention since the rock."
"What are your favorite places/websites to get folkish clothing?","I wear a suit and tie on my body.  But my heart is clothed in evergreen boughs padded with frost."
"What are your favorite places/websites to get folkish clothing?","Just wondering; do other fans of folk metal actually dress in ""folk clothing?""

Never heard of that one before..."
"What are your favorite places/websites to get folkish clothing?","Hey man, if Omnia can do it, I can do it!"
"What are your favorite places/websites to get folkish clothing?","Around here (Netherlands, but also Belgium/Germany) it seems that a lot of the folk-fans at festivals dress in kilts. Or maybe: the only people wearing kilts at the festivals are folkmetal fans. That and drinking horns (which you can buy there as well) and often leather arm-gear.

 So it depends a bit on your definition and obviously it's not LARP or any attempt at being historically correct. You'll see Celtic, Scottish and Viking/Nordic stuff mixed together, even with a hint of 'pirate' in the mix since the folkmetal people blend in with the pirate-metal folks easily.

As for women, I think you see a bit more corsets and long skirts among this crowd than the general metal crowd. "

"The OC Weekly's top 10 Folk Metal Bands","The best are subjective and I'll leave it at saying I disagree with a few choices they made. I will say fuck them though for spreading that across 5 pages, these are the times I feel less bad about using Adblock because it denies those extra page views they're apparently so damn desperate for. I really dislike that tactic."
"The OC Weekly's top 10 Folk Metal Bands","Not sure how some of those bands would be considered folk metal. Also, where is Equilibrium?"
"The OC Weekly's top 10 Folk Metal Bands","Not a very good list. Also, how is Wintersun folk metal? I don't think being Finnish is enough to qualify."
"The OC Weekly's top 10 Folk Metal Bands","&gt; Also, how is Wintersun folk metal?

I think they are, but barely. Not in the more common sense though, they use some Japanese (I hope anyways, I know it's Asian but not sure which specific flavor) folk melodies in Time I. Something tells me this isn't what the people who made that list are referencing though.

"
"The OC Weekly's top 10 Folk Metal Bands","Damn, what about Týr, Equilibrium, Heidevolk, Moonsorrow, or Arkona? I know all of them can't fit and there are definitely way more honorable mentions, but dump Blackguard, Wintersun, and maybe Agalloch (and fuck Alestorm, but that's just me not liking them haha)."
"The OC Weekly's top 10 Folk Metal Bands","Agalloch is more Post Black Metal than Folk Metal, and Wintersun is Epic Melodic Metal.  This list doesn't make much sense.  Eluveitie is worthy of a better spot, and just like the other guy said, Equilibrium definitely deserves a spot up there.  They need to replace the non-folk metal bands with bands like Arkona and Fejd."
"The OC Weekly's top 10 Folk Metal Bands","What the fuck? They put Ulver and Wintersun on that list? They're barely even folk metal. I cannot agree with any top X folk metal bands list that doesn't have Moonsorrow."

at the sparkle of ice they silently weep  
all ages of mortals they know  

 
&gt;and the bright sky reaches throughout the north  
raining hoar upon the woods  
it conceals the stars and sets the sea in fire  
shakes mountains by thunder  
halting the day, raging at night  
 

&gt;for long the clouds have traveled  
restlessly swelling above the waters  
if the heavenly flame now melts the frost  
with just the stream we drift  
 

&gt;those white fields they blind the night  
silent giants of stone and of ice  
 

&gt;the wind shall scatter the cold fair land  
and the eternal stream fall as snow  
none ever living on these plains  
the ice cold wind now takes the fair land  
 

&gt;far away wind driving the clouds  
carving mournful verses to stone  
the sky leads the weary roamer astray  
struck down by the white nothingness  
thus curse the giants of stone and of ice  
from here none shall pass  
 

&gt;should the trees be burnt to ashes  
should the shore be buried under the waves  
no man can ever own this land

"Energetic Folk Metal?","I've noticed that folk metal can range from being quite fast and energetic to being slower and more atmospheric.  My preference is definitely the former. I was wondering what songs people could suggest from different folk metal bands that are their fasted and most energetic. 

Here are some examples of what I like:

[Eluveitie - Havoc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM1v-00C6AM)

[Ensiferum - One More Magic Potion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZjIEodvyHg)

[Equilibrium - Waldschrein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjKJlKQ50wE)

[Finntroll - Under Bergets Rot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEzuxkkGyWQ)

[Korpiklaani - Ievan Polkka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a247R3mNs5A)

[Skiltron - Fast and Wild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjqIMSScRXg)"
"Energetic Folk Metal?","I'll give this a bash :) Though you should definitely explore more ensiferum, finntroll and korpiklaani, most of their discographies are as you described. 

[Northland - The old towns inn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QVAE9mksZU)

[Svartsot - Havfruens Kvæd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALDIqNo0yUc)

[Cruachan - Celtica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdiuO8kPaVU)

[Equilibrium - Blut Im Auge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yom8nNqmxvQ) - Now there's a popular song if ever I saw one :P

[Aether realm - Ravensong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYeJdshOjP4) - This is a little more on the melodeath side of things but it's folky enough :)

[Svartby - Scum from under water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Edn9N4L1U)

[Mithotyn - In the sign of ravens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoIeHtoy1YY) - Blackened

[forefather - The shield wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw7i40cDMj0) - A lot blackened

[Ásmegin - Bruderov Paa Haegstadtun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjZnvrijzmc)

[Lumsk - I lytinne två](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5lMZfg2rfA) - This may be too slow, they mainly write slow churning riffs but this riff just feels a little faster. This one will be hit or miss.

[Myrkgrav - De to spellemenn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G25ZWp7C7yA) - I find this incredibly uplifting

Otyg - Villevandring - I cant find a link for this but it's on spotify :) great band, really consistent.

[Nomans land - Torir scald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrrvrbVjnI)

Well that's all I can think of for now. I'll edit if I think of any more. :) Hope these are on target, Enjoy."
"Energetic Folk Metal?","I'll give these a listen later but the Northland song sounds great! I know the Equilibrium song and it is an awesome song.  Thanks for the list!"
"Energetic Folk Metal?","Also, Svartsot is just too good to not list twice!

[Svartsot - Havets Plage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGdXCcHD7NI) makes me stomp my feet and headbang a little every time!"
"Energetic Folk Metal?","brilliant band indeed, I just struggled finding a song I loved with a fast tempo, I enjoy a lot of the slower heavy as fuck songs :)"
"Energetic Folk Metal?","""De to spelleman"" is an awesome song!"
"Energetic Folk Metal?","Completely agree. I spoke to the guy behind myrkgrav over reddit messaging, he is a great guy too."
"Energetic Folk Metal?","Thanks for giving me more bands to listen to! I need add even more variety to my library. "
"Energetic Folk Metal?","No worries man"
"Energetic Folk Metal?","Would be a shame to not link to Otyg.  Here is [Otyg - Vilievandring](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvwKb-PN8Rk).  Note the spelling that may have tripped up your search."
"Energetic Folk Metal?","Thank you for finding that, yeah some of these spellings trip me up with my native language being English :) Thanks"
"Energetic Folk Metal?","Can I just say I love how popular Aether Realm has gotten? They're from my college town Greenville and I've been to almost all of their Gville and Raleigh shows since the beginning because their music is awesome and they're some of the most energetic shows I've ever been to. Much recomend."
"Energetic Folk Metal?","Aww yiss, In the Sign of the Ravens"
"Energetic Folk Metal?","Finished the list, the songs that stood out for me were Aether Realm, Svartby, Forefather and Ásmegin.  Thanks again for the list!"
"Energetic Folk Metal?","Good lad, glad you enjoyed some of them :)"
"Energetic Folk Metal?","Energetic on their own way, kind of uplifting for me. Old but gold.

"Energetic Folk Metal?","I'll add several more


Cannot fucking recommend Metsatöll enough!

[Metsatöll - Muhu õud](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMSMu4Vqj-g) - Here they are live, because they are sooo good live.  Also, here is a cover they did with the Estonian National Male Choir - [Raue needmine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXcup1ZsJXA).  Also, every song by Metsatöll.


[Fferyllt - Йолль](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ7HV5fwhkw)

[Glittertind - Rolandskvadet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBlixPMAkR8) - There are faster songs on the *Til Dovre Faller* EP too, but this is just so epic.  But, maybe a sea shanty - [Longships and Mead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k79XjRJM170) or... this... [Trollbunden](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laOo4ua73_4) which I'm not sure is even Folk Metal anymore, but I do like the beat.

[Gwydion - Mead of Poetry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFIzzU0Hhlw) - Also most of *Horn Triskelion* and *Ŷnys Mön* are great.  Haven't listened to *Veteran* much, but it's their latest.

[Heidevolk - Wodan Heerst](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shv5XO84VFA) - or just go full on mastodon riding crazy with their excellent cover of [Vulgaris Magistralis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reOLeLX0Q9U)

[Månegarm - Nattsjäl, Drömsjäl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQdD7kRWE0Q) - fairly upbeat, much of their stuff isn't.  Not really atmospheric, just not upbeat.

[Skadika - Frost](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFYoMrzeJ4)

[Thyrfing - Mjölner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7iv4Gf3MXw)

[Týr - Flames of the Free](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w7VR-N-3Ww) - I guess some of their older stuff might be a bit atmospheric, but as my favorite band, I had to include something.  Also [Hold the Heather Hammer High](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu2bgwcv43o)!

[Vanir - Elverkongens Brud](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNYTi6_0fE) - They are often compared to Svartsot.


And some Industrial Folk Metal

[MystTerra - Đurđevdan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5g6xPXrocM)

[Tanzwut - Das Gerücht](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-PZMqSdpdo) - wonderful video!  They are pretty much just electro industrial at this point, save for the bagpipes, but maybe you'll enjoy it.

I listen to most of the mainstream folk metal too such as Ensiferum, FinnTroll, Korpiklaani, Suidakra, Turisas, you get the point. What I want is more folk metal with lots of bagpipes.

I started making ringtones in Audacity once I got a smartphone. I've had Masha Scream growling, can't spell the song name. My notification is the ICQ classic ""uh oh!"" 

Basically, a growling ringtone assures not only will I know it's my phone, I'll be able to hear it and dig it out quickly, but it kind of scares people. 

I think I'm going to try a non- growling ringtone, not sure what. "

"The Wolves Of Avalon - Bonded By Blood and Sword (2014)",""
"Why do you like foreign/ethnically different bands?","I've always wondered about this. I'm dutch and I like Eluveitie and Finntroll although I usually can't understand a word they're saying(for lack of a better word).
I understand mostly anything in  Dutch, English, or German I still like stuff in other languages, but I assume that's due to an international upbringing, but how does everyone else do this?

Also, from what I understand about foreigners liking Heidevolk it's the vocals, which are being caused by always having at least two vocalists singing every line. I admit it sounds pretty epic."
"Why do you like foreign/ethnically different bands?","For me one of the major things was the diverse nature in the music.  Listening to music outside of my pre-established comfort zone is a nice change of pace.  That being said, as a musician, finding new influences from other cultures is a pretty awesome way to develop my toolkit of playing techniques/styles."
"Why do you like foreign/ethnically different bands?","what do you take from it? the instruments, rhythm, pace, style, whatever is it you kids call it nowadays?"
"Why do you like foreign/ethnically different bands?","Unfortunately I'm not made of money, so not the instruments.  A lot of the method (riff structure, note choice, music theory etc.) gets absorbed into how I play. I'm from the U.S. so I don't get a whole lot of exposure to tradition folk music of many other cultures, so the influence from that into folk metal also permeates through.  I don't personally write folk-metal music, but I've noticed that several times when writing something on acoustic guitar that I've accidentally stolen riffs from folk-metal songs.
As far as rhythm goes, much of folk-metal rhythm is rhythm found in many other genres of music, lots of 4/4 in folk metal and lots of shuffling and galloping rhythm which are prevalent in most genres of metal."
"Why do you like foreign/ethnically different bands?","For me its the languages as well as the folk instruments. I grew up loving traditional folk music and going to high school and college with people who had immigrated to the US from other countries made me really appreciate the sound of foreign languages."
"Why do you like foreign/ethnically different bands?","I love the atmosphere and complex compositions that are all unified by deceptively simple folk melodies.  I enjoy the diverse intrumentation and the ""anything goes"" nature of the music.  

Folk metal is able to contain banjos, accordians, violins, horns, pianos, ethnic percussion, gamelan, saxaphones and even orchestras.  As a composer, this really appeals to me as I love hearing different ways traditional/classical instruments can be used together in new ways.  

And on top of that, metal in general has an intense, grand atmosphere akin to classical symphonies and I find that atmosphere is particularly prevalent in Folk metal.  One of my favourite folk metal bands, Moonsorrow, produce masterful soundscapes like no other.

Of course I don't exclusively listen to folk metal, but it is the niche genre I enjoy the most.  "
"Why do you like foreign/ethnically different bands?","I agree with most of what everyone else here says.  Another good thing about music in foreign languages is that you don't notice if the lyrics are shitty if you can't understand it at first.  I'm therefore less concerned with how terrible the lyrics are and more concerned with how awesome everything sounds!"
"Why do you like foreign/ethnically different bands?","There's something for everyone. I also love the variety of instruments used in some songs. Really awesome."
"Why do you like foreign/ethnically different bands?","I like them because they make good music.

"Arkona - live video of the new song ""Сербия""(Serbiya) from their upcoming album Yav (more infos in comments)",""
"Arkona - live video of the new song ""Сербия""(Serbiya) from their upcoming album Yav (more infos in comments)","Arkona are currently on tour in Russia and this song was recorded in Arkhangelst. Not the best quality, but it's a good sample of what awaits us with their new album Yav.
Yav in slavic mythology means the ""material"" word, where we live now, in contrast to the ""immaterial"" world Nav and the ""law"" Prav.
 
Masha said in an interview that it will be much different to their other work. She described the sound of the new album as progressive, post black metal-ish with folk elements.
There won't be any ""fun"" songs like Yarilo or Stenka Na Stenku because they wouldn't fit into the concept of Yav. They will probably release these songs seperately.

The whole recording process was very challenging. Three songs were already recorded by their new drummer [Andrey Ischenko](http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Andrew_Ischenko/7342), who replaced Vlad ""Artist"" after he left the band for personal reasons.
Some guest musicians will appear on the new album, including Thomas Väänänen (ex-Thyrfing) doing guest vocals, Olli Vänskä (Turisas) on violin, Aleksey ""Master Alafern"" (Sviatogor,...) on violin and Vika ""Vkgoeswild"" Yermolyeva on piano.
There will again be a small monologue spoken by Masha &amp; Sergey's son Radimir.

This is why i love the term vocalist. Most people in Metal don't really sing... they do something else with their voice. "

"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","Personally I'm in a stage in my life where I prefer to hear growls over everything. But folk metal is something where I have next to no tolerance for clean vocals. The only exceptions are short interludes and maybe the odd chorus if its chanted/yoiked. I'm put off bands like Alestorm and Korpiklaani and such simply due to their clean vocals. I mean I think the reason is growls and harsh vocals in general sound more earthy and non-human. Often when listening to folk metal, the folk music itself reminds me of nature, forests and meadows untouched by mankind. And the growls are almost like a primal voice of nature or something. If that makes sense. I can't explain it. lol I just like the feeling of pure isolation, and pure animalistic nature. Apart from the songs about taverns and drinking."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","[deleted]"
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I prefer cleans in Folk metal (see 'Where His Ravens Fly - Falkenbach,  Wanderer - Ensiferum). It feels more... traditional, like a story being told. That being said, I do not dislike harsh vocals."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I agree. I don't dislike growling but I prefer Folk to have clean vocals since I view it as being bard like. "
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I lean towards harsh when I'm listening to metal, but whatever fits with the music best."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I love some good cleans, but I prefer higher pitched voices in both men and women, unless there is a completely obvious ""viking"" feel to the music. Moonsorrow and Enslaved (not *really* folk metal but whatever) do this really well.

I do prefer harsh vocals, but the harsh vocals in a lot of folk metal tend to be pretty bad, so I'm not usually too picky about it. Again, Moonsorrow is my favourite, but I find bands like Arkona and Emerald Night use theirs sparingly and really well.

Primordial I guess falls under the category of folk-influenced metal, seeing as they've got a mostly pagan/black metal feel to them, but their vocalist has easily the best clean and harsh vocals in that style IMO."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","Enslaved aren't Folk? Well, humph. I've always thought of them as a badass Folk/Black band. 

(Pointed sarcasm here.) "
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","One of my favorite harsh vocalists in all of folk metal is the guy from Suidakra. I can't fuckin remember his name now."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I disagree. . .I think folk metal should have clean vocals and the abundance of harsh vocals in folk metal ruins a lot of the modern bands for me.

But I grew up on Skyclad and Mago de Oz. For newer fans, which is seemingly all of /r/folkmetal, it's been Ensiferum/Finntroll, etc. So I understand the preference for harsh vocals."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I used to hate harsh vocals. I got into folk metal with Korpiklaani and Elvenking. But as I grew older and explored more metal, the more I despised most clean vocalists :P Not all of course, Tom Waits, Myles Kennedy, and admittedly Matt Sanders (avenged sevenfold) are all amazing to me. But when it comes to folk metal I like to hear harsh vocals. Just suits it for me."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","The harsh vocals that I really, really like are those along the lines of Svartsot and the deep/cookie monster-esque vocals. Eluveitie is another exception, but I don't really consider it folk as much as it is melodic death metal with folk instruments.

For example, I love Equilibrium, but I can't stand the vocals. Same goes for Korpiklaani and Finntroll. . .I try to actively avoid them at festivals now because I really can't stand watching them anymore (though they're super cool guys to drink with)."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I really like songs that combine both clean and harsh vocals. My favorite is when they're both sang simultaneously. If a band does a lot of their music in only one vocal style I start to get bored of listening to them.  
And I've always preferred growls to higher pitched shrieks. I can't stand it when harsh vocals are high pitched."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","[deleted]"
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","Agreed. I like manly grunts!"
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","*Oh my...*"
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","lol only just realized the connotations"
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I like both, if they are good.

Folk Metal is one of these genres where there is a lot of crap, but the good stuff really shines.

Using Finntroll as examples (as the fellow in the current top post mentioned, I think it really makes for a great album when we have songs like Galgasang in between harsher tracks."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","Both."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I'm sort of the same way as you OP. However, it depends for me. Depending on who is singing, I sometimes don't mind clean vocals. I suppose it depends on the mood I'm in. But, for some reason I never usually mind clean lyrics when they are sung in another language. Not sure why. "
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","Actually yeah I think I can see that. With some styles I'd much prefer if it were foreign."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I like both, but I lean towards clean. What's #1 for me, though, is the instrumentals behind the vocals. Eluveitie was too growly/screamy to me at first, but the great music behind it kept me coming back. Now I like the harsh vocals, but it has to blend with the music, and still be somewhat intelligible. Bands that scream for the sake of screaming (especially if they don't have lyrics) sound stupid to me. I hate Trollfest."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I agree that in all melodic music with harsh vocals, the instrumentation is key.  The harsh vocals are more equal with the instruments and you'll commonly find the harsh vocals accompanied by a melodic line that ""makes up"" for the lack of clear melody in the vocal line.  "
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I mean I know Alestorm and Korpiklaani are ""clean"" in Metal terms, but their vocals are both ""harsh"" in their singing style.  They are more half-spoken, half-sung.  

I personally love clean vocals, particularly female vocals, as found in bands such as Eluveitie and Battlelore.  

However, Folk metal is definitely predominantly harsh black-metal-esque vocals, which I personally think suit the tone of the music perfectly.  "
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I like a healthy mixture of both, too much growling and it seems a bit too much like it's just noises with no meaning, but without any harshness it seems like it looses it's ""metalness"", if you know what I mean."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","Have you heard of leshak? They're a Russian death folk band, with those growls of unearthly proportion. "
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I have. Admittedly I'm not a big fan of their music. Found it too sinister and metally and not folky enough. Definitely brutal growls though. "
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","It's not for everyone. Just thought I'd mention them. "
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I really enjoy folk metal when it is upbeat, and for that reason I tend to enjoy the clean vocals more. Folk Metal is just a metal genre that makes me feel really happy and adventurous, so I don't like when it's too harsh. :)"
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","Some of the most uplifting songs I've ever heard have harsh vocals :P I don't think they're mutually exclusive"
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","Then I guess it's all subjective! :P"
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","Definitely clean vocals for me, almost all the way. [Falconer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh9frx4R38k), mid and later [Skyclad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dLARkGkMbM) - I know that Martin's [thrashy voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS5OPo2v18w) isn't technically harsh, but it's definitely not clean and beautiful like on [The Answer Machine?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwlRmv8TEWA), and [Týr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu2bgwcv43o). However, I do like the occasional growl or whatever in my folk metal, specifically with [Battlelore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnQ46dk2vY0). (Maybe not folk metal at all, actually)

Now, I personally don't see Alestorm as folk metal at all. As such, they're a power metal band and they have power metal singing, which makes sense to me. Although to be fair, much of the 'folk-metal' I like is really power metal anyway (Falconer and Týr's later albums come to mind). Then, there is the matter of Mittelalter Rock or Metal, which in general has clean vocals (I've actually never seen it with growled vocals). [Faun - Tanz mit mir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK5MdsewTjM) and 
[Saltatio Mortis - Früher war alles besser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8yF9zqlpR4) are examples, not technically metal, but still on the heavier end of the folk-rock spectrum.

I really like the idea of the growls sounding earthy, that's a really interesting thing to think about. In general, I don't really listen to Folk Metal like that, I think, so maybe I'm missing out. For me, folk metal is not about nature or anything, but more about the beat and the sound of the music, which is why I really like Falconer and Skyclad."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I would say that saltatio mortis is folk metal. It has folk instruments, is inspired by folk music and is metal. What makes it not metal to you? and oh god I love faun."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I personally do think of them as metal, for the most part, but the line between rock and metal becomes rather blurred. As such, I think it's more helpful to list them as Mittelalter Rock/Metal, since I'd like to consider Faun and Saltatio Mortis as part of the same sort of genre, even though one is more metal/heavier rock. Altogether, Saltatio Mortis just doesn't have the heaviness, in my mind, to make it really objectively folk metal. That isn't any slight against it or anything, nor does that mean there's any problem with posting it here, I just think of them more as hard rock with folk influences."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","For folk metal, most of my favorite bands growl or scream, but there are a few amazing ones that do mostly clean vocals. Falconer and Elvenking are two of my favorites. I prefer the stuff that has a good mix of both like Ensiferum, OLD Turisas and Craving."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I love death metal but Folk is something where I prefer clean vocals. Tyr is my favorite band right now and I just love their style. Through them I found Alestorm and Korpiklaani and I love there music. I especially love Rummplugged. I think of growls more as demonic and Folk is more worldly and close to nature. "
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I prefer clean vocals, but growls are okay as long as they aren't too excessive."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I prefer a healthy mix of both "
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","[deleted]"
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","I feel exactly the opposite, im tired of growls and much prefer clean vocals. I wish more bands sounded like Alestorm and Korpiklaani."
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","Yeah, I love clean chants, but it's all about the harshness for me. I feel the same way. "
"Your thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?","yeah like the manly chanting in Segervisa by Manegarm or Fard by Grimner!"

"Hercunia - Exobnos (Italy - bagpipes, bouzouki, hurdy gurdy)","Sounds really good.  In some sense, this is how I wish Eluveitie would sound.  "
"Hercunia - Exobnos (Italy - bagpipes, bouzouki, hurdy gurdy)","Well, one of the goals of the band is to try to bring folk metal back to a more raw and less elaborate style."
"I just bought ""Origins!""","I've been waiting for this day for months. It finally feels good to listen to amazing new music. I especially like Sucellos, Call of the Mountains, Inception, and Inception."
"I just bought ""Origins!""","Great album, I can't wait to see them live this autumn."
"I just bought ""Origins!""","I'm hoping to see them in Houston in September. Seeing them with Tyr will be an incredible experience. Pagan Party!!"

"I just bought ""Origins!""","I love the new album. I ordered the limited mail order edition box from Nuclearblast, the 4 different versions of Call of the Mountains are very nice too."
"I just bought ""Origins!""","Yeah every song is pretty good. I really was allured by 'from darkness' and even tho it's been released king is epic. 
Next new album to look forward to is ensiferums new on releasing next year. So long to wait..."
"I just bought ""Origins!""","I so fucking hope the next Ensiferum album is better than the last pile of shit they put out"
"I just bought ""Origins!""","Aww man. I loved unsung heroes. Honestly the first listen I was quick to judge and wasn't too impressed but after I was able to give it a few good listen throughs I really enjoyed almost every song. Minus celestial bond. That song belonged on a shit sandwich. But top 5 bands go:
1- ensiferum
2- kalmah
3- eluveitie 
4- dethklok
5- amon amarth
"
"I just bought ""Origins!""","I love Ensiferum I just hated Unsung Heroes. Except Burning Leaves"
"I just bought ""Origins!""","Great song. And dude do this for me. Get moderately stoned and listen to
In my sword I trust
Unsung Heroes
Last Breath 
Pohjola
Star Queen
Retribution Shall be mine
Passion Power Proof (no joke I've listened to it 203 times according to itunes) great song

It took some time to really appreciate but I thought was a good overall album.
Also im assuming youre an amon amarth fan check this out if you havent already seen it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWQmb7ADTTA"
"I just bought ""Origins!""","That Amon Amarth cover was badass though, I think I've heard other songs from that same band.

My top 5 is 1.Eluveitie 2. Blind Guardian (Probably actually tied for #1) 3. Wolfchant 4. Waylander 5. Suidakra"
"I just bought ""Origins!""","Nice. I'm always, always looking for good new metal and I've heard of all those bands (I really like Suidakra, even walked out to Darkane Times for an mma fight once) but can you send me you're favorite song form 2,3 and 4? Thanks man. "
"I just bought ""Origins!""","If you pm me I can send you a few links when I'm on my laptop later but I'll list them here too.

Blind Guardian- Bard's Song (The Hobbit), Bard's Song (In The Forest), Bright Eyes, Blood Tears and Tanelorn are my favorites (no way I could pick just one)

Wolfchant- Clan of Cross

Waylander- Of Fear and Fury
"
"I just bought ""Origins!""","And here's a few lesser known folk metal bands I really like if you want something new:

Adorned Brood- Pagan Knights

Craving- Targaryen Wrath (They're not exactly folk metal, but close enough that most folk metal fans will like it.)

Frosttide- Siege

Hammer Horde- In the Name of Winter's Wrath

Mael Mordha- Dawning of the Grey

Nightcreepers- A Tale of Haste

Skadika- The Hero Way

Wolfheart- Ghosts of Karelia (death metal but they're a recent discovery I'm REALLY starting to love)
"
"I just bought ""Origins!""","I am a huge Amon Amarth fan and I've listened to every Ensiferum album at pretty every level of stoned, I just really can't get into Unsung Heroes. Believe me, I tried, they're one of my favorite bands of all time. If it was from a different band I'd probably like it more, but after the masterpiece they put out with From Afar I just couldn't appreciate Unsung Heroes."
"I just bought ""Origins!""","Am I the only one who thinks Victory Songs was the last truly epic Ensiferum album. From Afar was good (I absolutely loved Twilight Tavern), but it felt somewhat repetitive."
"I just bought ""Origins!""","Wanderer from victory songs is amazing! And from afar had heather throne then the longest journey. So long. So epic. Best way to spend 20+ minutes if listened to in a row. And yes twilight tavern is a masterpiece. "
"I just bought ""Origins!""","I loved Victory Songs, but I really consider From Afar their best. They really didn't put out anything I didn't love the shit out of until Unsung Heroes."
"I just bought ""Origins!""","I wasn't too keen on the first few songs they released as teasers but after purchasing today and giving it a full listen, this album is definitely good. There are some real gems. I also look forward to seeing them this Autumn (along with Týr!)"
"I just bought ""Origins!""","Really love the album. I posted 2 lyric videos for The Nameless and From Darkness but Nuclear Blast took them down for copyright! I didn't really have any malicious intentions but I sent a PM and email to Nuclear Blast. Hopefully they respond soon and let me post them. I didn't think there would be problems as everyone posts lyric videos :( Does anyone know more about this situation?"
"I just bought ""Origins!""","I've been hearing some shady shit coming from Nuclear Blast lately. They're currently fucking over Wintersun pretty good right now"

"Myrkgrav - Vonde auer [new single]","Dunno, I love the rawness of the original. :) But okay, after having listened to it something like a few hundred times according to last.fm (15th most all-time, apparently), it's getting a little hard to judge.

Allow me to fanboy a bit then: Always enjoyed the faster songs from the from Trollskau the most, and the new song is absolutely fucking fantastic! Listened to it a bunch of times in office before I reached the conclusion that I had to get to Systembolaget before they closed, so I could listen to properly when I got home. Then I did that. A couple of highlights include at 0:38 when one thinks ""wow, neat high"", but then it turns out that the actual high is at 0:40 instead. Also, the stuff around the 'switch' at 4:50 and onwards. And all the stuff in between."

"Powerwolf - We Drink Your Blood","I'd be curious to know, what subgenre of metal would this song be classified as? I would have put it under folk metal for lack of anything closer, does anyone know?"
"Powerwolf - We Drink Your Blood","It's most definitely power metal.  What are the folk metal influences that you think are present in this song?  

Listening to any other song of theirs confirms that it is power metal.  I mean the name alone is one of those stereotypical power metal idioms.  

I personally don't think using a church organ synth qualifies anything as ""Medieval"" or ""Folk.""  It's much more in line with the gothic/theatrical style of metal, which is confirmed by their lyrical content.  Their ""uniqueness"" comes from their vocal layering to create the choral effects, but I believe that's more part of the theatrical nature of their music.  Put crudely, it's basically the whole ""Evil-church"" image in line with bands like Ghost however I think Powerwolf is far more tongue-in-cheek. (I mean, I can't imagine ""Sanctified with Dynamite"" being anything more than a fun power metal romp with heavy riffs.)

EDIT: Just to confirm; every online source labels them ""Power Metal.""  "
"Powerwolf - We Drink Your Blood","Genre argument aside (and it shouldn't be an argument -- it's very definitively power metal) -- it still scares me how many people don't realize Powerwolf is a complete joke.

No one remembers them before they were Powerwolf, eh? They were a stoner rock group called Red Aim. They've always done this ""joke band"" thing. I *think* I still might have some of their stuff somewhere on an old thumb drive or something -- I'll have to search for it this weekend."
"Powerwolf - We Drink Your Blood","Definitely agree.  The song titles alone should reveal how over-the-top and cheesy they are.  To some extent even Alestorm is a ""joke band.""  They even make fun of their lack of lyrical diversity in the song ""Scraping the Barrel"" with the verse:

*You may think you've heard all this music before
That ""Running Wild"" did it back in.84
But times are a changin' and we don't give a damn
So if you don't like it, go start your own band
Many have told us that we can't go on
That one day we'll run out of lyrics for songs
But when the time comes to write album four
We'll scrape out the barrel once more*

I disagree with the OP that Powerwolf's image is ""folk inspired"" in any way.  It is definitely clerical (aka ""Evil Church"" image) and gothic, taking on the typical Catholic Priestly gowns.  The video you linked to takes place in a church with the lead singer singing in the confessional.  

I would also link vampires and werewolves with the occult and gothic, not folk."
"Powerwolf - We Drink Your Blood","Like I said, I would put it under folk ""for lack of anything closer."" It obviously doesn't sound like a typical folk metal band, but from the band's costumes, their lyrics (a lot about werewolves from what I gather), and their image in general they didn't seem to fit in with other genres of metal."
"Powerwolf - We Drink Your Blood","Probably more along the lines of power metal, but I definitely see your point, there are folk or medieval themes in there."

"Metal Child Ballads?","Anyone know of any good metal renditions of [child ballads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Ballads)?"
"Metal Child Ballads?","These might be kinda what you're looking for:

* [Korpiklaani - God of Wind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWCQW7OpySg&amp;feature=kp)
* [In Extremo - Liam](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkX1iNUq6Jw)
* [Troll bends fir](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iG2qF0JvvM)
* [Arkona](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgXlUxDGFvU)

I won't say these are actually based on Child Ballads, but most of them are based on some kind of history/tale.
Most of the bands base their songs on some kind of history, take for example Finntroll, Vanir, Bathory, Waylander or even Eluveitie. I'm sure you're going to find some nice songs.

Summoning has a lot of awesome songs based on the Lord of the rings lore."
"Metal Child Ballads?","I've listened to a lot of Korpiklaani, and some Arkona. I like this sort of thing, but I was just thinking that I've never heard a metal adaptation of any child ballad. Even the Twa Corbies. Which is weird, because every non-metal folk singer has recorded some child ballads, and plenty of the have pretty metal subject matter. The Twa Corbies is a dialog between two crows talking about eating a dead knight, for god's sake. 

Well, if no one here knows of any, I guess I'll go hunting through metal-archives myself."
"Metal Child Ballads?","My bad, IN extremo is actually the ""Herr Manneling"". I'm not sure if this is a child ballad but it is a ballad of a troll who got inlove with a knight.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herr_Mannelig"
"Metal Child Ballads?","I'll try it, thanks! It's not a child ballad, as those are specifically Anglo-Scots ballads (also found in places where Anglos and Scots emigrated) collected by Francis James Child in the late 19th century. It is traditional, though, so it's closer to what I'm looking for."
"Metal Child Ballads?","Found some. There's:

* [Allison Gross - Black Ballads](http://www.realmusic.ru/ag/music/), I don't like it very much, but I don't listen to enough black metal to judge it
* [Wolfmare - Twa Corbies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aacfhWLVxEc), much more like it."

"(New Release) Eluveitie - The Call of the Mountains (Multilanguage)","Yeah? I though of especially Helvetios being more and more towards the metal part of the band."
"(New Release) Eluveitie - The Call of the Mountains (Multilanguage)","Helvetios was definitely more on the lines of metalcore than their previous work, but the album relied a lot of techniques similar to that of pop music.  Relying heavily on catchy choruses and repetitive verses was a common theme across the album.  It was also a lot more vocal-focused than previous albums.  It's still had some great songs, and I'm not entirely anti-pop either. Slania, for the most part, was the album that had the most metal element in my opinion, and even that had a lot of pop structures.  It kind of fits since they're going for a 'new age' sound, but, as a musician, I'm a huge fan of the more dynamic structure such as a lot of Ensiferum's longer songs.  I hope I've not gone too in depth and managed to cover an acceptable response for you!"

Thanks for the band suggestions, though. "
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","In and of itself, it isn't a bad thing. Independence is always something that people of a certain region will feel sympathetic towards. North America has lots of examples - Cascadia, Quebec, the South, the (Canadian) West, etc., but for the South in particular, there's a correlation between people who truly believe it and people who believe in racial purity. Quebecois independence has its own issues with cultural purity, and people who want the Canadian West to be independent are generally libertarians of the worst sort (not all, though!). "

Cornerstone Address 1861, Confederate V. President Stephens:

**Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition.**

This, our new Government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. This truth has been slow in the process of its development, like all other truths in the various departments of science. It is so even amongst us. Many who hear me, perhaps, can recollect well that this truth was not generally admitted, even within their day. The errors of the past generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago. Those at the North who still cling to these errors with a zeal above knowledge, we justly denominate fanatics. All fanaticism springs from an aberration of the mind; from a defect in reasoning. It is a species of insanity. One of the most striking characteristics of insanity, in many instances, is, forming correct conclusions from fancied or erroneous premises; so with the anti-slavery fanatics: their conclusions are right if their premises are. **They assume that the negro is equal, and hence conclude that he is entitled to equal privileges and rights, with the white man...** I recollect once of having heard a gentleman from one of the Northern States, of great power and ability, announce in the House of Representatives, with imposing effect, that we of the South would be compelled, ultimately, to yield upon this subject of slavery; that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics, as it was in physics or mechanics. That the principle would ultimately prevail. That we, in maintaining slavery as it exists with us, were warring against a principle-a principle founded in nature, the principle of the equality of man. 

The reply I made to him was, that upon his own grounds we should succeed, and that he and his associates in their crusade against our institutions would ultimately fail. The truth announced, that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics as well as in physics and mechanics, I admitted, but told him it was he and those acting with him who were warring against a principle. They were attempting to make things equal which the Creator had made unequal.

In the conflict thus far, success has been on our side, complete throughout the length and breadth of the Confederate States. It is upon this, as I have stated, our social fabric is firmly planted; and I cannot permit myself to doubt the ultimate success of a full recognition of this principle throughout the civilized and enlightened world.



If you're not clear on what the principle he talks about yet, its that Blacks are chattel and undeserving of equal status to Whites. 

I'm tired of pretending the Confederate flag isn't the hillbilly swastika it obviously is. 


"
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","I was talking about today, but whatever man. You believe all that brainwashing you were indoctrinated with. "
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","Those are the words, right from the mouth of the Confederate Vice President, spelling out the **cornerstone** of what the South stands for.  

Its like arguing against gravity because its *just a theory.*  
"
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","You, sir, know not what you speak of. 

I'm sure Biden represents everything the Democrats stand for, right? I mean, he's their spokesperson, and everything he says should be stated as the beliefs of the entire left, am I right?"
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","Why not just check the states' declarations of secession. Slavery was the first and foremost reason stated in at least a few states' declarations, and I believe it was a major topic in all of them. And really, that's what it was all about.

Southern pride, etc.? Go for it. But the Confederacy isn't really something to be glorified like it so often is. I get that it represents a lot of ideals that are close to you, but when it comes down to it, its foundation was an attempt to continue to be able to own other people."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","Many people honor heritages that have made mistakes.  Nearly every culture can atone to that.  Just because you have ""southern pride"" does not mean that you are racist or want to return to slavery times.  And just because your history book tells you so doesn't mean its true.  The world is not black or white.  One mans statements do not reflect the entirety of the peoples thoughts or opinions."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","Well said."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","Bravo!"
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","Hrmmm...that would be an interesting genre. The closest thing I can think of is Southern Rock (lynyrd skynyrd obviously)."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","Eh, I don't like Lynyrd Skynyrd. I use to, until they became openly anti-Southern. Also, they're not metal, they're classic rock. "
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","I know, it's just the only confederate themed music I could think of. "
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","I hear you. 

Drive By Truckers is a good band, if you're into Skynyrd btw. "
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","Well since America is very limited when it comes to Folk Metal I don't think you'll find what you're looking for.  The closest thing to Southern Pride Metal would be Rebel Meets Rebel.  Basically Pantera with David Allen Coe singing.  Funny how even a suggestion of Southern pride turns into an argument about racism, etc."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","I know right? That's that Yankee indoctrination for you.

Yeah, I really like David Allen Coe, although I wouldn't have considered him metal. I'll look the band up, though. Thanks, man."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","[deleted]"
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","That's interesting. 

  You should start that band.

 If there is music that exists in your mind and nowhere else, why not materialize it? You don't have to get rich and famous but creation is it's own reward."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","[deleted]"
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","I do not. I don't really have that musical talent, as I've tried to learn, but have failed each time. 

I think if you want to have that heart in your folk music, you got to listen to Appalachian songs. That's true American folk music, right there. "
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","I had an idea to do metal themed on Texas cowboys and Indians type culture, since I live in Texas.  Truth be told, I actually despise Texan everything is bigger attitude, but it would be fun to sing a song about gunslingers and bounty hunters.  The idea fell through and now we're just a normal metal band singing about various other things.

I would like to here some good historical Sabaton-style civil war metal, but told from the Union side.  Because fuck slavery.  In fact, the closest I can think to your question is Grinded Nig, a horrible Texan band that consisted of neo-Nazis and KKK thugs.  I only found them on Metal Archives and was disgusted and amused."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","Please do not relate Fascists and racist idiots with the Confederacy. 

Mexicans, Indians, and yes even blacks fought for the Confederacy. I believe one of our Secretary of State was even Jewish. We had Irish fight in our ranks with Kelly's Irish brigade as well. "
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","The CSA was kind of founded on Biblically/pseudoscientifically-justified theories of white racial supremacy. I don't really see the point you're making. There were plenty of Africans who fought for Rommel, doesn't mean anything. I don't think that everyone who fought for the CSA was a horrible bigot or whatever, plenty honorable and brave men as well as  irredeemable scum on both sides of that lil skirmish. Anyway, have you checked out Hank III? Maybe you hate country, but it scratches the same itch for me as folk metal. He also does metal but it doesn't quite do it for me besides his cattle-call grindcore."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","I've listened to Hank III, and I think he's better when he sings the older stuff. I'm not really interested in that cursing white trash stuff. He's more Rock a Billy, then metal. "
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","Fair enough. What would you want to see out of a Confederate folk metal band? I feel like it'd be really hard to pull off without discussing race."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","When I think of Confederate folk metal, I think of Viking metal. However, instead of songs about waring Vikings, we listen to songs about waring Confederates. 

Race would have nothing to do with it, because it'd be about the Confederate ""warrior"" defending his homeland from the Yankee horde, and not about the politicians and plantation owners. Does Viking metal ever bring up how the Vikings would slaughter defenseless monks or enslave people (well, I'm sure some does, but you get my point)?

"
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","The majority of 'Viking metal' is oriented around violence, booze and mythology, often talking about putting monks to the sword, yes. Why is the Confederate warrior defending his homeland? Why does the Confederate insist upon independence? What is truly at stake for him and his that is not at stake for the Union besides the loss of human chattel? I can see there being a Sabaton-type band oriented around the Civil War, but I can't see a purely Confederate folk metal group that wouldn't be basically all about white power tunes."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","There were Indians, and Mexicans who fought for the Confederacy too. Irish, Catholics, and even one of the Secretary of States was Jewish. 

I mean, Sabaton would be a perfect example or Amon Amarth. Just replace Odin with God, Vikings with Confederates, Swords and axes with Bayonets and Cannons. There you go, you got a great Confederate metal song.

Here, this is what I'm looking for but in metal form

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLMU90Aa2Oo

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdIGFOGzjJ8

These songs might sound bad to metalheads, but just imagine Amon Amarth singing these. "
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","I know that the CSA armed forces were not racially homogenous. I also don't find that information particularly meaningful. Neither was the Wehrmacht, but Nazi folk metal is, well, Nazi folk metal - but hey, I listen to a lot of fascist music, a lot of neofolk and neoclassical. I just don't like WNs and don't like getting certain songs stuck in my head. If there was a folk metal band that incorporated hillbilly shit, rebel yells, etc., - even if it talked about slavery in an interesting way - I'd probably fuck with it. One of my favorite bands at the moment, Death in June, has a really interesting way of being almost nostalgic while also being cynical about its object of nostalgia (mid-1930s German political climate).

The reason why I reference Sabaton is because they write their songs from multiple perspectives and in an overtly theatrical, unserious manner. If there were songs that were sympathetic to both sides - which is something you kind of see in Amon Amarth, too - that'd be cooler. If there was stuff that openly acknowledged the menace of both sides in a Cormac McCarthyish way that'd be cool too. No heroes, just honorable death."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","I guess I'm just not getting your animosity toward Confederate centred music. I mean, you say you listen to Nazi metal, but you don't like WNs? Well, I'm not a white nationalist, and I just told you about other races and groups who fought for the Confederacy, and the Indians and Mexicans fought alongside Texans and Tennesseeians. They weren't seperated at all, like in the North, but I really don't want to get into politics.

I just want to listen to Viking/folk metal-esque music about Confederate soldiers. I don't have to support the politics of the time to respect my ancestors who fought for my State, do I? As far as I know, my family never owned slaves, but again I'm getting off topic. It just frustrates me how I just want to honour my ancestors or feel proud of them, while others just want to bring up slavery. Well, Vikings had slaves too, but no one cares about that. What's the difference? 

My point is, we don't have to bring up slavery at all. Just talk about the war, not the politics. "
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","White Americans definitely didn't invent black slavery and your ancestors don't have a damn thing to be ashamed of for laying down  their lives for what they thought was right. Honor them as it makes sense to you. Owning slaves was, however, a shameful and evil thing that lay right at the heart of the Confederacy. I know my ancestors owned slaves in the Caribbean. One of them was a [London merc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_St._Leger_Grenfell) who fought under Braxton Bragg, but I dunno if he owned slaves. He fought for money and tried to take Chicago. Sure was a character. I will say for the last time that I consider it completely irrelevant that the CSA was not ethnically homogenous. Had the CSA succeeded, the institution of slavery would have continued for some time longer, period, and I think it's a good thing that the Union won. I am also not denying that Yankees were and are bigoted, often in a more insidious manner than any southerner. 

I have no problem with Confederate-centered music, I just don't think it could be done *chauvinistically*, a la most folk metal, in a manner I would find very interesting or listenable. Simplifying the struggle that people on both sides of the war had to some Manichaean shit just sounds boring to me. I don't listen to Nazi metal because it's mostly boring, nor do I listen to antifa shit besides like Billy Bragg and some leftist country. I do listen to stuff that uses fascist symbology in interesting ways. 

The difference between Scandinavian thralldom and Black slavery in the Americas should be easily discoverable with a few minutes spent on Wikipedia.

If you make or listen to Confederate music, people are gonna talk politics no matter what. 

TLDR On the whole, I think Confederate folk metal is a potentially interesting idea that would predictably rustle many jimmies. The only people in metal singing Dixie's praises at the moment that I know of are making white power crap, which is lame."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","I guess I agree with most of what you're saying, and I definitely know where you're coming from. You're right on that last comment, ""white power"" bull has really put a damper on us Southrons. People associate symbols and people with things that ought not be associated. It's sad, and hopefully these ignorant perceived correlations will fade with time, and people of all colour will be able to honour our symbols without thinking of ""racism"". 

Hopefully someone will sing a melodic folk metal song about Confederates charging a cannon battery for glory and freedom, without caring if he's called ""racist"" for it.

Again, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but Thralls sound a lot like Southern slaves. http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/thralls.shtml"
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","I read the same page and reached an exactly opposite conclusion to yours from it, but I won't let that spoil our resolution."
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","I don't know, I've read a lot about slavery since I'm interested in that time period and history, so that might be why it reminded me so much of it. I mean, to me, it sounded nearly the same except Thralls couldn't get married, and Southern slaves could. 

I'm glad we've found a resolution. "
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","The confederacy wasn't all about slavery, but the cultural idealism here in the south, at least where I am, can be split into two factions.  Those who know nothing of history and just stick a confederate flag on their truck to look badass, and those who secretly hate minorities.  It's unfortunate that there isn't much middle ground. "
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","Well, I'm that middle ground. What you have to do, is educate those who are ignorant of their actual history, and ignore the racists. 

You're right, though, it's very sad people don't know more about history. "
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","Im sure you can find white power bullshit.  Real question is why?"
"Is there Confederate folk metal?","I didn't say anything about white power."

"Heidevolk - Vulgaris Magistralis","One of their best songs hands down"
"Heidevolk - Vulgaris Magistralis","This is the song that really started getting me into the genre. "

"Heidevolk - Vulgaris Magistralis","It's my go to work out song."
"Heidevolk - Vulgaris Magistralis","I remember these guys from when they first rose to fame. It was great seeing them play in the local metal store and it's awesome that they gained so much international fame. Only downside is that they rarely seem to play in the Netherlands any more and spend all their time touring the rest of Europe. Kinda funny to see a Dutch-singing band play more abroad than local. "
"Heidevolk - Vulgaris Magistralis","They will be at PaganfestXL with Korpiklaani, Turisas and some more bands! So I will be there, too! "
"Heidevolk - Vulgaris Magistralis","Yeah, it's an awesome lineup, I'm seriously considering going there. Unfortunately I don't know if I can convince my metal buddies, they're not really appreciative of folk metal."

"Nightwish - The Islander","Kinda funny seeing NW here, since they're PM most of the time... But this, yeah this is quite a nice FM song."
"Nightwish - The Islander","They've been having more and more folk-elements in their music for a while now, the latest album having the most.

With the addition of a full time pipes player you can be sure to see more of them here! :)"
"Nightwish - The Islander","They haven't really been power metal  since century child either you could argue Once but really the only album they've had that has been pure power metal is Wishmaster. But poet and the pendelum and Imaginarium had a lot of folk elements in them. They are more like soundtracks using whatever instruments get the point across. They also use full orchestras as well as folk instruments and metal. "

"Folk Me.","Hey gang, I've been into folkmetal for a long while and have been developing a taste for more folk-heavy Scandinavian bands. Lumsk, Fejd, Gåte, Garmarna, Wardruna... Can any of you recommend some music that is more folk/less metal but still has a heavy/groovy feel? I'd also be interested in some traditional Scandinavian folk songs too.   
-Tusen Takk!   
   
EDIT: Thanks for the suggestions, just to clarify I am not really looking for anything with heavy/shredding guitar. I am looking for music more similar to [Wardruna](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HMl81zRp4E), [Hedningarna](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkhmj3JZDuk), or even [Finntroll's Visor Um Slutet.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKlgbF2kmPY)"
"Folk Me.","Týr are very folk. Check out their versions of old Faroese folk songs like [Ormurin Langi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDOy9cg45p8) or [Torsteins Kvæði](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8yY8mZ-pIQ)."
"Folk Me.","Torsteins Kvæði is probably one of my favorite Tyr versions of folk songs. "
"Folk Me.","Arguably they are the most folk of all folk metal bands, without even using any folk instruments.  No other band (that I know of) uses so many traditional melodies and direct translations of ancient lyrics.

Also recommending Ramund Hin Unge, Regin Smidur, and of course, Sinklars Visa!"
"Folk Me.","Big Týr fan, very excited for the new album."
"Folk Me.","[Gjallarhorn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cnON5E8NuU) and Månegarm's acoustic EP [Urminnes Hävd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhjKu1k7_9k)"
"Folk Me.","Man, I knew there was an album I was trying to think of… Urminnes Hävd, seriously, OP, check that one out!"
"Folk Me.","[Agalloch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzZs0nDBKLE) is good. They're not Scandinavian, though. You probably wouldn't believe they're American."
"Folk Me.","Dude totally, I picked up their first two releases like a month ago. Really digging so I just got The Mantle."
"Folk Me.","Moonsorrow are probably one of the best folk metal bands out there if you like LONG sweeping songs.  

Here's an instrumental from one of their best albums: [Tuulen Tytär/Soturin Tie] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRpdakf-k9o)"
"Folk Me.","What about [Hedningarna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedningarna)? [Faun](http://faune.de) is also another excellent folk band from Germany."
"Folk Me.","Yes I like them, they are one of the examples I gave in my post."
"Folk Me.","Ack! Totally missed your edit. ;) Glad you like them, regardless."
"Folk Me.","You probably already know about these guys, but definitely Corvus Corax.  Also, Skyforger has one all folk album, called Sword Song."
"Folk Me.","I've heard of CC but never actually heard any of their stuff. I'll check it out, thanks."
"Folk Me.","Also, there's Eluveitie's Evocation I album, which is all acoustic."
"Folk Me.","And is so good that they probably should think about dropping the metal all together. I hardly listen to anything else of theirs any longer. Word on the street is that their new album will be acoustic, too. Pretty damn excited."
"Folk Me.","Me too, I just listened to Evocation again yesterday.  Definitely one of their better albums."
"Folk Me.","Valravn is arguably more electronic than heavy, but you may like them.  Dalriada (or Echo of Dalriada earlier) is generally considered folk metal, though not incredibly heavy or Scandinavian.  Stary Olsa is also not very Scandinavian.  Dunkelschön, maybe?  Odroerir, Skyforger's Zobena Dziesma album, I don't know, I'm stretching.  Maybe comment on those and see if other people can branch out from that?"
"Folk Me.","Just gave Valravn a listen, yeah I am definitely liking this. Kinda Bjorky. Thanks, I'll check out your other suggestions."
"Folk Me.","Try [Tuatha de Danann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatha_de_Danann_%28band%29), not Scandinavian folk but have a good mix of clean and metal. "
"Folk Me.","A couple more, [Metsatöll](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--i3pwGGabE) probably have fewer shreddy songs than folky songs, though it is a mix of both.  The folk instruments are used to greater effect than pretty much any other band I've ever heard; like the metal is secondary to the folk as opposed to every other folk metal band.  For 100% traditional, look at [Krauka](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CZpJ2Osrtw)."
"Folk Me.","Most of the ones I know of have been mentioned, but I can think of a couple more...

[Poropetra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnyuiHz0NQ) from Finland. Theyre completely unknown but I think the music is amazing. Theyre kind of hard to find but you can listen one of their albums  on [their myspace page](https://myspace.com/poropetra)

You might like [Hoven Droven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvtdSo0laTg) too.

[This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46WW3D5a_TU), by Sami singer Maddji

"Folk Me.","Thanks, I've actually been listening to Maddji on youtube. I think it's time I pick up her album. I bought a few Falkenbach albums a while back, and I remember them going folk song - black metal song - folk song - black metal song. Didn't really mix the two together and I found it kind of disjointed. Is that a theme with them, or are there albums with more of a blend you would recommend? I do remember really liking their drummer."
"Folk Me.","[Storm- Oppi Fjellet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiyR9wT16UU) All of Storm's stuff is calmer/folky (sung in Norwegian.)

[Skalmold- Heima](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK3zLq2e0uM)

[Skalmold- Valholl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5msp718Gb6g) All of Skalmold's stuff isn't that folky, it's a bit heavier but it's a great band anyway. (Icelandic)

"
"Folk Me.","Check out Neun Welten. You might also like Tenhi and Nest, but they're more ambient."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","For me, it's the harmonic and melodic elements of the guitar work. Blending in folk music has a completely different psychological effect from just plain old metal.

Black, death, and doom metal saturate your palate, but there's not as much substance there once they whisk you off into a music trance. 

Folk metal's an entirely different story for me. The folk music elements construct another world where the stories of battle can come alive as the metal washes over you.

I think I truly fell in love with the genre when I was listening to Ensiferum's Wanderer while doing a kettlebell workout. I finished the workout and slammed the kettlebell down to the final time they sang ""but the wanderer's part is to ride alone."" This music is fantastic for physical exertion, since they're always singing about rallying your inner strength to go battle.

"
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","Ensiferum and Ensiferum. 
Most specifically Heathen Throne I and heathen throne II (the longest journey). Part III comes on on their next album. Can't wait! "
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","Tyr was the first band, I was curious about Scandinavian folk music,  Tyr kept getting mentioned, now I'm a huge fan.

Progressing from there, I've picked up several bands I really enjoy.  I'm a pretty big history buff, so music that blends the sounds and stories of Pre-Christian (and in some cases Pre-Roman) cultures just fascinates me, and in some cases has been a jumping off point to learn more about these cultures."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","It's hard to tell why, but I can tell you who. 

First there was korpikaani, then alestorm, then I think it was Turisas, and so on. 

I don't know. I guess I just like music about the olden days and songs that tell tales of adventure. That and unique instruments you don't hear too often anymore. "
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","Came for Finsterforst, stayed for everything else. Ive only started into the genre about 3 months ago and didn't even know I loved folk metal til them. As I dive deeper down the rabbit hole I've learned 2 things; I have no idea what anyone is saying, and I need more."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","Ensiferum in 2001. It was actually the first thing I *ever* bought from the Internet - bought the album off of the spinefarm.fi website with my dad's credit card (I was still in high school; I gave him the cash for it, don't worry). I remember both of us being so worried about giving the Internet our credit information.

Originally heard 'Token of Time' on ""the metal channel"" in 2001. This was when we first got digital cable and they had all those extra music channels. It was like channel 511.

Later that year I discovered Skyclad, which I found to be a lot more folky than Ensiferum and I really, really liked that sound. I've been hooked ever since."

"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","The first metal album I ever listened to was Turisas's *The Varangian Way*, which I bought after seeing one of their concerts on some obscure Sky music channel.

"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","Got invited to Paganfest with Ensiferum headlining, and Turisias, Elvuaitie, and TYR playing as well. Had no idea who any of those bands were the day of the show. Walked out of that concert a changed man."

As for now... medieval. Mittelalter? (Can't spell, sorry.) I haven't been listening to much else than Subway To Sally (who I probably found via Eluveitie Radio on some streaming service), Saltatio Mortis, In Extremo... I'm not sure if Faun counts.

I can't take harsh growls as well as I used to, so I don't listen to as much folk metal as there is out there now. I love how diverse the cultures in folk metal are though (like the folk aspect of it). 

Edit: type Eluveitie into any streaming radio service. (Like base a station off of Eluveitie music.) The amount of bands I have found this way is incredible.

Edit 2: I joke that I like anything with bagpipes, hurdy gurdy or both."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","I first listened to Eluveitie's Your Gaulish War when that was the song playing over a youtube video about Paganism 3 years ago. I loved it and I wanted to know what the band is that made it. I searched in the comments and someone said it was Eluveitie. So I searched them up and I didn't know that this kind of music existed. I was't a metal fan at all to begin with and I was going through a phase when I listened to country and Dubstep (I was in middle school guys). At first I couldn't get Chrigel's growls but I gradually accepted them as the vast majority of Eluveitie's songs featured them. I then found bands like Finntroll and Arkona and Ensiferum. Because Eluveitie was my first metal band they are my perpetual favorite band alongside Finntroll as Nifelvind is one of my favorite albums of all time. 

Because I've not really have heard any recent Folk Metal that has blown me away, I've gotten into other metal sub genres like Norwegian Black Metal with bands like Gorgoroth, Dimmu Borgir, Tsjuder, Taake, Carach Angren, and Opera IX. The only Folk Metal band that has come close to Finntroll and Eluveitie would be Munarheim and their cover song The Last Unicorn and their recent song Nachtmelodie. I'm sorry to say that I'm not really into Folk Metal that I used to as Folk Metal is not as visceral and terrifying as pure Black Metal. I'm just saying that I feel more energy watching a video of Black Mass Krakow 2004 than a video of Paganfest."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","Actually myspace classified Turisas as black metal at least ten years ago so I gave them a listen. Not what I considered black metal but it turned me on to the epicness that is folk metal. "
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","That's pretty strange. The same person who classified them probably thinks Linkin Park is metal."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","I first got into folk metal after exploring Turisas, specifically through their album Battle Metal. I later started to get into Ensiferum and Korpiklaani. I was a HUGE Dimmu Borgir fan before that. But after discovering that the folky side to metal can be awesome, I found that I really started to appreciate the melody and acoustics behind them. Some days, all I'll listen to are the instrumental/acoustic songs in certain folk-metal albums. 

For instance, I really enjoy Finntroll's [Visor om slutet](http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Finntroll/Visor_om_slutet/17534/) - it's a purely acoustic folk, no metal. "
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","Týr - Regin Smiður

So my story goes like this:  There used to be some rogue metal internet radio station. People could pick songs out of a list to play - but it was all stuff you've never heard on the radio. Maybe the artists, but not the songs. I came across Blind Guardian, who I couldn't get enough of. So I started looking up their stuff on Youtube, and came across the aforementioned Tyr song. It was amazing, nothing what I've heard before!

What keeps me a fan is the lore, the harmonics and melodies like you said, and that many bands use folk instruments."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","There is still a place like that which exists! There's a small community of Groove shark that does broadcasts of folk metal which allows you to suggest songs. I learned a lot that way "
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","I've always listened to a lot of different music, classic rock, alt rock, ""mainstream"" metal and hard rock and stuff like that, as well as stuff like DNB etc. A couple of years ago I started listening to Power Metal and in one of the videos I watched linked to Korpiklaani. After clicking through recommended links I hit up piratebay to see how long the music lasted on my ears before I started to buy albums. 

I'm still listening to Folk Metal now because its just so different everything else I listen to, hell the closest that folk metal comes to my rock tastes is Skyclad, and thats still pretty different, just without the growls and screams of everything else. The genre just has everything I like between Hard Rock-""Regular"" metal and more."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","Kinda a weird one thing lead to another story.

Father listens to folk music both New England sea faring kind and Celtic. Mother with stuff like Bob Dylan, Aerosmith, Rolling Stones, etc. I kept a liking to to both parents type but also explored my own liking and tastes. 

I went with liking Rammstein as my first foreign band when I was first introduced to them in high school German class. While exploring herzelied.com for lyrics I saw some recommendations/ads for Tanzwut and In Extremo and liked them a lot. 

Then one day I got bored and watched some muppets shows and started watching the Swedish chef when one linked to him lip syncing Korpiklaani's Wooden Pints. I grew very interested and listened to more of their music and finally discovered they are part of FOLK METAL. Going back and seeing Tanzwut and In Extremo were folk metal I knew this was a genre I liked a lot. And pretty much from there I just went deeper and deeper and fell in love ever since with the genre and this subreddit has only helped open more doors to discovering other bands from all over Europe and Asia. 

I love the music similar to OP with harmonics and melodies. I also like how with each band brings a bit of their culture and instruments to the table so it is also an anti-xenophobia kinda  experience with meeting people through their music. A different taste to the bland radio auto-tune music and how every singer/band sounds similar. Also it feels like home with having music that is sorta a love child from my parents own music."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","[deleted]"
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","1&amp;2: Ensiferum and Turisas mainly.

 (I just discovered folk metal recently, and unfortunately not years ago. So I don't even know if my answers can count haha.)

Wanderer was the first folk metal song I heard as well and I thought fuck yeah I love this. I've really gotten into Ensiferum, Turisas, and Korpiklaani (I think they sound more folk punk but what do I know). I dig Tyr and Alestorm as well.

After listening to all the Ensiferum albums I'm interested to hear their newest."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","By accident really. Plus I really love folk music in general. One day I was looking at Celtic folk music on youtube and stumbled on to this song by Suidakra:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jLIYEsC-84

After that I was immediately hooked. Folk metal then got me into melodeath and power metal, and metal as a whole. I still love Folk Metal the best because of its harmonic/melodic elements like you said, and also because it was Folk Metal that opened me up to a whole new world of music.

Also, I completely agree with you that Folk Metal is the perfect music to workout to. Nothing like pumping some iron while listening to epic riffs and battle chants blasting in your ears."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","Discovering online radio and coming across Manegarm and well one band after another. Love the music."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","[deleted]"
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","For the most part, it was an accident. I originally wanted to explore other types of music besides rap so I started listening rock and screamo when I was young. And then one day, in the recommended videos section of Youtube, was 'Blut Im Auge' by Equilibrium and I was hooked for a little bit more than six years ago. Since then, I've delved more into Folk Metal and now, Eluveitie, Wintersun, and Korpikklanni are what I listen to the most.
What kept me as a fan? Well, tbh, Folk Metal is the only type of music that can lull me to sleep and then excite and make my heart race in just a single verse. "
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","I grew up listening to Irish music and got into metal pretty early so hearing my two favorite styles of music combined was like a dream come true."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","I started with Týr. In fact, [Ormurin Langi]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtjksfgCp0I) is the first metal song that I specifically remember hearing (I'd almost certainly heard some before but that was the first song that stuck with me). But Moonsorrow is definitely the band keeping me in folk metal."
"What got you into folk metal, and what's keeping you a fan?","When I was 14 some kids were listening metal around me. So I tried it, too. It stuck with me. When I became 16 and MP3 players became a thing which you could fit more than 12 songs on I started looking for all sorts of bands in the metal genre. A7x, SOAD, Metallica, Megadeth. Some youtubers like Sandy Ravage heavily influence some of those choices. 

So eventually I got into Folk music as well, and it just mixed over time. I discovered Folk Punk and Folk Metal was only so far further. "

Fortunately they played Kivine Maa both times!"

"What are your thoughts on the new Vanir album?","I took a listen to the new Vanir album recently, and was incredibly disappointed. Compared to Onwards Into Battle, which got me into the band, the new album seems so bland and boring from beginning to end. Thoughts?"
"What are your thoughts on the new Vanir album?","Bagpipes are not leading songs like previous albums.  Almost a death metal sound more than folk.  I like it but for different reasons than their other releases.  I do miss an ""anthem"" song with a good chant to sing along with."
"What are your thoughts on the new Vanir album?","Exactly! Like I wanted a chant like the title track of onwards into battle, or something fast and fun like by the hammer they fall. "
"What are your thoughts on the new Vanir album?","I think their new sound fits with the ""war is grim and has always been"" theme they have on the album. It feels heavier and darker compared to the romanticized viking feast in their old stuff. I don't think it is bland nor boring, but I was expecting something else and I do feel a bit dissapointed. The thing is that it feels less so the more I listen to it and I think that I might really enjoy it in the future. I am just going to have to put the new and old songs in different playlists. "
"What are your thoughts on the new Vanir album?","I think you hit the nail right on the head. I've been listening to it again, but approaching it as a more death/viking metal album as opposed to pure folk, and I'm enjoying it a lot more. That being said I hope we see a return of their pure folk sound"

"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I've never been a traditional metal fan. My music preferences range from Rush to Muse to RHCP to Metallica to Tenacious D to Cake to ... (I should probably stop before it just becomes a list).

Folk Metal is something I've found that I can really get into though. I started listening to Eluveitie a long time ago, and they're still by far my favourite folk metal band (so much that I've warmed up to the ""death metal"" vocals that I typically avoid). I also enjoy Korpiklaani, Alestorm, and Tyr.

Anyways, Eluveitie is hitting NA with Tyr and Metsatöll this year. Detroit is such a short hop across the US-Can border for me that I just *cannot* pass up this opportunity.

Now, I've never been to a metal concert before. Ever. The closest thing I came to I guess was... Slash double heading with Billy Idol? And that was in an casino theatre with no floor.

So I'm not sure what to expect. I know that metal fans are all known to be extremely rad and nice people, and I know enough to leave my breakables and personal space at home.

Any other words?

Alternatively, who else has seen them on this tour, and how sweet was the show?

EDIT: Update/review posted in comments!"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","If you don't want to mosh, stand towards the back or to the side. If you try to get up near the front of the stage, expect to be run into by moshers several times. Ear plugs are also a good idea if you value your hearing, especially if you will be towards the front. Don't wear open toed shoes.

I saw them in Oakland, great show! Try to get there on time, because Metsatoll is a really great band that deserves a good audience. Lauri (the one who plays bagpipes/flutes/sings a little) has the best voice ever."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","YES. Lauri has a fucking awesome voice. Everyone in the band is very friendly. I had the pleasure of speaking with them after the show since they were standing in the venue towards the exit to meet fans as they left. Man, the lead singer has certainly put on a few pounds, that's for sure! But they are all great guys and they put on a fucking AMAZING show. Their music is more ""folk"" than the other two bands and they have a lot of unique instruments that get used throughout their performance.

I've seen them twice and both times they made me love their music."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Definitely going to try to hit them at opening, I have been introducing myself to Metsatoll over the past few weeks and I can dig it.

I'm going to try out some musicians' head phones I've been hearing about. I figure at the very least I can take them out if I don't like it.

Shoes -- I hear about that a lot. I typically wear sturdy running shoes (New Balance), but a lot of people have said go as far as wearing boots. I do have some boots (being Canadian, of course I do) but my feet sweat like a beast when I'm sitting at my desk during the work day in them :P"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I wouldn't say boots are necessary. I haven't had problems in sneakers."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","DONE. :P"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Good boots have saved my toes quite a few times when moshing, but I don't bother with them for shows that I'm not expecting to spend most of the time in the pit."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Adding onto the mosh pit, don't fall down. At all. If you do, do everything in your power to get out of the pit, or else you're fucked. Getting trampled in a mosh pit is a really easy way to ruin your week (or more)

If you manage to stay standing up, moshing is actually pretty fun! Just be careful about it and remember that if you get hurt, it probably wasn't on purpose. The people are (usually) there to enjoy the music and have fun, not to cause injuries and make enemies."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","&gt; Getting trampled in a mosh pit

Is luckily something that is actually pretty rare! At least for all the shows I've been too, whenever someone went down in a pit, there were instantly 5 man helping the guy up. :D"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Yeah, if someone gets trampled and seriously hurt, then the show ends pretty quick and cops show up and there's a lot of very unhappy people"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I've never had a problem either, I'm usually one of the dudes helping them up to avoid any serious problem."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Yeah. I'm a tiny girl and tried my hand at moshing, knowing very well that I would end up falling. Got picked right back up no problem and was able to get out of the pit when I wanted to. Won't do it again until I get a bit stronger, but it was still a pretty fun experience."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Eh, falling down isn't such an issue. Sure, it could turn ugly but usually as an accident rather than a deliberate act. Metalheads generally look out for each other. Most metalhead moshers will likely be falling over each other to help you back up.  I was knocked out cold at a show (my own fault) and woke up to 10 people holding me up. Thanked them and went back to moshing. Thankfully I didn't have a concussion.

That said, watch out for the 'Flaily McRagefists' whatever-core types. They're idiots who are more interested in their own personal gratification at limb flailing and taking up the entire pit than moshing as a shared experience. They're easily spotted because they won't actually be moshing to the music playing, but rather to some horrid soundtrack playing in their mind, no doubt accompanied by imagery of themselves masturbating to how cool and edgy they are."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","&gt; Flaily McRagefists

I'm stealing that phrase! And yeah, I've seen that kind of dickhead a few times, they always ruin the show whenever they're swinging their arms around and kicking at anyone who comes near them. I missed a boot to my dick by just a few inches at the last show I was at, it was NOT an experience I'd do again..."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I have to say I'm always amazed to see a pit come to a screeching halt when someone hits the floor. Hell, I saw a pit stop when a guys glass fell and broke."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I have also heard like /u/Dread-Ted that it's pretty rare, but I am of course going to be conscious of where I am throwing myself into :P"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Just watch out for yourself, enjoy the music, and have a good night!"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I was knocked over while moshing at a small venue in Atlanta once.  The second I hit the floor, some guys grabbed me and picked me up and put me back on my feet before I could even react."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I actually went to see the Eluveitie, Tyr, Metsatoll concert as my first concert about a month ago. It was incredible. Absolutely 10/10 amazing. Chrigel was such a nice guy, he thanked the (pretty small) crowd multiple times after each song and seemed like an amazing person. I bought a shirt because of him. My advice if I could do it again: Don't be afraid to go wild. Watch the first few mosh pits to see what other people are doing and then just copy them. Headbang until your neck hurts, and mosh until you have bruises.  
  
Frequent bathroom breaks shouldn't be a problem. The crowd was pretty small and there were breaks between each band. You will have plenty of time to relieve yourself a few times between bands.  
As for how the concert went, Metsatoll opened and the crowd was nearly stagnant with a few bobbing heads, what can I say, their music just didn't fit the atmosphere. Tyr helped warm up the crowd a little, and there was finally a little bit of hype. By the time Eluveitie got on stage the (600ish) people that were there were going nuts. Mosh pits and headbanging all throughout Eluveitie. It was the most fun I have had all year."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Thanks for the review! I'm really looking forward to it. My preferences go in that order (probably not surprising), but I've been making a point to listen to some Metsatoll stuff as well and I can dig some of t."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I say don't mosh if it's your first show. Unless you don't care about your spot or don't love the bands. Me personally still usually don't mosh unless the bands are on my casual kind of list. I like going early, getting a great spot and keeping it. Moving in a mosh you'll never get your spot back without traversing through people. Don't be that guy "

"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I was there! I remember the bubbles. I was in the pit during Eluveitie and ended up in a row of guys, shoulder to shoulder, all of us doing an Irish jig dancing line. Great show."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I just saw this line up a few weeks ago! It was soo lovely seeing the ladies from Eluveitie smiling &amp; having fun while playing. &lt;33 

Tyr played Hold The Heathen Hammer high, it was lovey. 


The folkmetal show seemed a little tame in comparison to say, a Dying Fetus or Necrophagist show. There were a lot of adorable metal ladies wearing medieval like clothing with long ass hair. It made me super excited to see ladies digging the folk metal arena."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I saw them 10/6 in Portland and it was a fucking fantastic show! Hands down the craziest mosh pit incited by a flute solo I've ever been in.

Don't worry too much about the pit... there are kinda some unspoken rules to them. Try them out if you want but they are avoidable (especially if you like to hang out in the bar). Nearly everyone in or around the pit will immediately stop and and pick you up if you fall (even if you're a super trashed girl who decides the best place to chill is laying on the floor). Our pit actually stopped to help a guy find the pieces to his broken glasses.

There was a wall of death... ours ended in a 10 man meat pile, but then rescue crews headed in.

All three bands were phenomenal. You're in for a treat.

"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","don't get committed to your ""spot,"" and expect to lose it whenever you go piss. or you could be real nasty and just piss in a bottle, and hold a spot up at the barrier (but really, don't actually do that).

also, this was a fantastic show, maybe one of the best I've ever seen. you're in for a real treat."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","It also seem it's a small venue, so getting out of the crowd and back in somewhere (I'm not picky on my spot) should work for me. Yay old man bladder."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Hell yeah! I've seen Týr and Eluveitie (and Korpiklaani) every time they've been to Michigan. I'll be there again Oct 16 in Detroit!

The mosh pits aren't too crazy. They'll pick you up if you fall, and you can get out when you need. And if there's some douchebag neonazi doing his stomp thing, people stop moshing until he quits (happened at Blondie's once). 

Týr usually doesn't get much of a mosh pit, which i like since i can get to the front row. Of course their new songs are heavier, i think they're trying to get people to mosh. 

Any way, it'll be an awesome show!"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Awesome, that's the show I'm going to. See you there! How is St Andrews? I've only ever been to Cobo and the Palace."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","It's much smaller than those venues. It's long and narrow, so wherever you are, you're in front of the stage. If you get there a bit early, you can get up pretty close. Also, i think St Andrews lists show time, and not doors open time (which is 1 hour prior to the show), so get there on time... I found out the hard way.

Get there not long after doors open and you can park across the street, super simple and close. They have good security, so the few bums there are shouldn't be a bother.  Overall that place is way better than Harpo's - I'm glad these lesser known metal bands have realized what a shit hole Harpo's is.

Hope that helps. See you there!"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I also saw the show in Baltimore. Get there early' metsatoll is a treat live. I've been to many shows all over the world, but there are few finer people than folk metal fans. They are friendly to talk to, and comraderie is forgedbin the put. Get in there. Trampleings only happened at the mega shows, and not in many years now. Alternate beers and water because it will be HOT and you should be bouncing around screaming like a viking berserker. How else will the band know you are enjoying what they work so hard to bring?
Also, dress up or dress down, but none of this middle of the road bullshit. Let that freak flag fly. "
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","The Folk Metal shows in NYC are always fun, and I haven't seen anyone get seriously injured in the mosh pit.  Occasionally someone loses their glasses and everybody stops moving and helps look.  It seems to be a regional variance.  I went to this past Paganfest in NYC and Massachusetts, and while at Irving Plaza (NYC) everyone was super respectful when things got rowdy, at the Palladium Upstairs (Worcester Mass.) there were a bunch of angsty savages just hurting each-other and even those who weren't trying to participate.

Maybe that's just Worcester.  Who knows with Detroit?

Awesome shows, regardless."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Hey man. I'm 17 and just went to my first metal concert ever. It was the show in Hollywood, CA on October 2nd. Eluveitie is probably my favorite band so that kind of drowned out the slight nervousness I had. Also Nicole was missing due to a family emergency so that was a bummer. I was seriously impressed though, Tyr and Metsatoll are WAY better live than studio in my opinion. Lots of energy and great stage presence. All 3 bands fucking demolished.

I also met a Danish couple and we spent the whole show together chatting about music and their home country. Very friendly people. 

Point is, don't worry to much. Everyone is there for the same reason, to enjoy some fucking awesome music. Of all the people I met everyone was super friendly. It turned out to be one of the best experiences ( of the few that I've had) ever. I Hope Eluveitie comes back soon!
"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Not been too worried, just excited and want to make sure I'm getting the most out of the experience. /nerd

""Everyone is there for the same reason, to enjoy some fucking awesome music."" is generally how I approach most concerts I go to, so makes sense ;)"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Now that's a good show! Definitely stand in the back if you're not into crowds. 

Shooting range earmuffs. They're good too if you're noise sensitive. I also bring something to completely cover my eyes (a hat, sunglasses aren't enough) because flashing lights give me a splitting headache. (Also have other issues but it's not relevant.)

Make sure you park somewhere where your car isn't going to be stuck in a garage.

 Finally sometimes if you stand by the door you can meet people in the band (if there's only one door to the venue). And you won't be the only fan there.

Have fun and BE CAREFUL! Just trust me on the be careful in Detroit! I'm not sure where the venue is but always be careful.

Also if you have friends online who are going you can possibly meet them there.

Edit now I'm mad I don't live near Detroit anymore and that I can't drive! "
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Thanks for the tips! I'm going with a buddy, so I'll at least have someone I know.

And yes, always be careful in Detroit. I'm more likely to leave my car in a garage for more security :P"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","You're welcome. About the garage... first metal show and we parked in a garage... turned out it was some college garage and we got locked out and had trouble getting it out. "
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I personally went to the show in Sacramento this past Saturday and I can tell you it was phenomenal. Eluveitie is the second best band I have seen live, after Wintersun. It was my girlfriends first time to a metal concert and she doesn't even like metal, and she still enjoyed it. Everyone put on an amazing show. I'd seen Tyr and Metsatoll before but they both **blew me away** by how far they had improved since I saw them last year. Especially Metsatoll.

Definitely stand towards the back if you do not want to mosh. I'm a heavy guy so I have no issues with people ramming into me (I don't mosh, but I stand in the front all the time so I am usually the edge of the pit). My girlfriend wasn't so lucky and a huge guy ended up running into her by accident and knocking her into the floor. Luckily nothing happened, she was just a little shaken up!

Finally, here are some videos I took of the show in Sacramento a few days ago. I hope you enjoy them and that they give you a good idea of what to expect!

Tyr: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYEoGHbsaQU&amp;list=UUUB4ctWYGdPJ1N0sMvwwB_w"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Oh hey! You're the guy that put the videos up! I've been watching 'em over the past couple of days, so thanks.

I was the short dude on the rail on the other side (right up against both rails). Definitely an impressive show, that venue may be my new favorite venue in California and would definitely make the 2.5 hour drive to see more shows there.

Lots of young people at the show and this seems to be a lot of people's first metal concert (as evinced by the thread). That was my 7th time seeing Eluveitie, 10th seeing Tyr, and 3rd seeing Metsatöll and I'm glad everyone in this thread seems to be enjoying this tour. I think Tyr's declined quite a bit since 2011ish but Metsatöll crushed it and Eluveitie sounded pretty solid despite Nicole not being there.

Advice? Bring earplugs and comfortable shoes. You'll be fine and don't worry about the pits."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I'm not young, but just exploring new music these days :) Well... I guess 25 is right in the middle of being young to half the crowd and old to the other :P It is good to hear that younger guys (and girls) are still getting into folk metal. And hopefully we can stop them from become douchebags, too ;)

Already bought some musician's earplugs from all the advice I've been hearing. They're something that I can just take out if I don't like 'em so I might as well try it.

Shoes -- trying to figure out if I'm going to go with my normal sturdy running shoes. A lot of people say wear boots but damn... my boots make my feet sweat on normal days where I'm just sitting at my desk."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Looking forward to it even more after all the good reviews I've seen. What song is that first one? I can't make it out from the setlists I've looked up.

EDIT: Oh, I see in the title it's Sucellos. I better go back and review some of the other setlists now that they've played more shows to add songs to my playlist :P"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Update after the show! Thanks all you guys here for the discussion. I've been pumped or the show for several weeks and I am geeking out since the moment it ended.

My buddy couldn't come with me (his passport wasn't in yet), so I ended up taking my friends 17yo song who is into a lot of metalcore and stuff.

Ricky and I arrived about an hour early. After narrowly escaping a hobo and being trapped in a tiny bathroom stall, we waited outside Saint Andrews for a bit before we realized the line was on the other side of the stair way. Oops. So we got in line and talked this cool bro named Eric who seemed to be there by himself. Ricky and he had way more to talk about in there metal band ways, of course.

The juicy parts... Eventually we got in and grabbed some t-shirts and waited for the first act. The venue was a lot smaller than pretty much anything I've ever been to -- which I think was a plus (more on that later).

Metsatoll came out on stage with no preamble or introduction and started playing. The crowd was a bit weak at first but started jamming along. Honestly I don't know what songs they played except for Kivine Maa which is the only song of theirs I know well enough (and I was pumped when the weird boingy sound started the song). They didn't play too long but it was a good set for not knowing any of the other songs and not understanding Estonian . The band members were really into it. The lead singer and guitarist (Lauri is his name I think) was so full of energy and really added to the stage presence. The bagpipe player went pretty hardcore and played his pipes behind his head like a mother fucking viking Jimi Hendrix. And the drummer looked vaguely like Slash, at least with the hair.

Tyr was up next and I learned something. One, it's not pronounced ""tear"". ""Tee-air"" or even ""tay-are"" perhaps, I don't remember . Second, the difference between the lead vocalist/guitarist and bass players like facial expression and attitude. The lead was all stony faced and ""I am a fucking viking God of metal"" and the bassist was like a fat, jolly, guitar licking energetic guy that kind of reminded me of Sebastian Bach.

Tyr's setlist was great and their performance was awesome. They're not as folk as the other two (no folk instruments), but still really enjoyable and enough up my alley for me to enjoy them. Highlights of the set list were Blood of Heroes, Hold the Heathen Hammer High, By the Sword in My Hand, and finishing with Shadow of the Swastika. Actually there were several more worth naming, too...

And this is where I begin to get into the show a lot more. I've always heard about how metalheads are the best kind of people, and I was explaining to Ricky on the way to the show the difference between the perception of metal core and true heavy metal. One is typically a younger, teenage crowd of guys trying to prove something and generally people being dicks and trying to hurt other people. The other is a bunch of guys who all enjoy the same thing (metal) and want to dance around and have a good time (and whose idea of dancing is slamming into each other). Or so I had heard.

Unsurprisingly and to my amusement, this turned out to be true. Metalheads are pretty fucking rad people as a whole. Where a half-drunk, wild mob might turn into a violent mess in other groups instead becomes a moshing mass of camaraderie. The first exhibit was a mosh pit during Tyr. It was fairly mellow to begin with the same 5-6 guys smashing around -- including a very large and tall dude who weighed probably upwards of 350 lbs. Who at one point happened to get knocked down. Immediately, the rest of the pit stopped and helped him up, to be met by a chorus of cheers (including the guy himself). Following that, some guy grabbed one of the moshers by the arm -- and handed him his phone which he had dropped. This was met by much hurrah and many hugs.

I proceeded to headbang and sing through the rest of Tyr's set, including belting out By The Sword In My Hand with another large Viking looking dude (hint, there are a lot of large viking looking dudes at these things). Then there was a line of arm-in-arm headbanging as well.

Tyr finished off with Shadow of the Swastika which I didn't expect to be one of their biggest hits but makes sense now especially for a set ender (high energy, and the line ""and you can kiss my Scandinavian ass"" was great to scream out with the crowd).

Some down time for stretching my old bones and hydrating before Eluveitie. They were why I came to this show. A band who isn't all that mainstream, especially in NA, and who I had never really expected to get the chance to see. Tyr I have listened to a bit recently and Metsatoll I only just discovered when I bought tickets for this tour and started doing my setlist prep. But Eluveitie I've been listening to for probably 3 years, perhaps more. I've even begun to appreciate some -- *some* -- death metal vocals because of their music.

To summarize their performance, it was fucking amazing. They managed to fit all 8 band members on that tiny stage and put a ton of energy into the show. Lead vocalist Chrigel was incredibly intense throughout the entire setlist and the whole band put on an amazing show, even though the crowd and venue was relatively small. When a musician really enjoys performing (and you can tell) it adds so much to the experience.

The setlist was pretty sweet. They played a lot from their newest album, of course, and at least one song from the others (several from Helvetios). It was changed up a bit from what I had looked up previously, like starting with King (which was an Encore or main setlist ender) instead of The Nameless. There were a few songs I was disappointed not to hear. Alesia they haven't been playing at their recent shows even though I think it's one of the best songs on Helvetios, but Celtos was on most of their previous stops and I had really warmed up to it. (Disclaimer -- so much metal has been running through my mind lately that they may have played it and I'm mistaken but I'm leaning towards no because I think I would've remember it more explicitly).

Nonetheless, the setlist still rocked. Too many to name all the awesome songs, but highlights/my favourites were King, From Darkness, A Rose For Epona (where Anna threw out plastic roses to the crowd), Thousandfold... And the two encore songs were awesome show enders. Helvetios is so powerful with its chorus (""cause we're born free / cause we're born wild / cause we are indominantable and bold"") and of course the ""crowd's turn to sing"" favourite, Inis Mona.

I had taken in most of the first two sets from mid-hall, just on the edge of the mosh pits. As Eluveitie's set got into it I decided to throw myself into the pit for some metal dancing. Pushing each other around and then headbanging and singing as the songs went on was thrilling. Its been almost 10 years since I've been to a concert where I wasn't sitting and I've forgotten how much fun it was.

I made my way up to the front, center stage (it wasn't that difficult I'm the small hall). I rocked out there with some rad dudes and chicks (including a guy named Zak but who preferred to be called ""cupcake"" or so he told me, and who swung me back in after I ran for a piss break). I wasn't right against the bar but it was the best thing. Being in the press of jumping, fist pumping, singing, sweaty bodies was a part of concerts that I miss, and I don't think it gets more intense and energetic than it is at a metal show.

And then... And then Chrigel says to the crowd something like ""you guys are already moshing that is fucking awesome. But you know there is a tradition in metal..."" And I look at this total stranger beside me and he looks and ms and we both say ""Wall. Of. Death."" And I know I am in. I didn't expect to, but at that point, there was no way I could not. I was completely in the zone. And then I tell him... I'm a virgin. Let's fucking do this. We split, and I am at the front of a wall of people, staring across the empty floor at another wall. And the drums smash and we smash into each other, happy as fuck and I'm giddy inside because when has running around wild ever not been fun. I fall to the floor with another guy but I'm not worried, and within seconds we're picked up and moshing again and I press back to the front to headbang and sing once more.

And I really enjoyed the venue. It was a small hall -- stage took up one entire (short) end, merch booth down one side and bar down the other. I loved that I was only 10 feet from the band. I didn't have to squeeze by a bunch of seats to get a drink or use the pisser (which as an old man I do frequently), and I could easily make my way back to my spot in the crowd when I got back.

Overall, it was an absolutely amazing experience. I left wanting so much more. If I could get to Montreal and back instantaneously, I'd go see them again tomorrow. I want to throw on more metal (and I picked up some recommendations) and jam out all day. My neck is sore and my throat is raw but I'm headbanging in the car and still singing.

I'd totally see them again if I had the chance. Eluveitie especially, but Tyr was amazing as well and Metsatoll was an awesome opening act (which should not be skipped).
"
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Awesome review! I totally agree with everything you said. I'm glad you liked it, and I'm sure I saw you in the mosh or wall of death, I was at the back left of the mosh pit standing next to a few guys taller than me (I'm 6'2""). Anyway, it was probably one of the best concerts I've ever been to! Everything was perfect.

Oh, and I believe Týr is pronounced ""Toy-er"", the ý is an ""oy"" sound in Faroese."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Toy-er sounds about right. I forget it about 5 seconds after I hear it :p

"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","My first concert was seeing Eluveitie live at the Masquerade in Atlanta.

"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Yay! I saw them last week, it was great. I will warn you that Eluveitie instigated a wall of death that looked kind of harsh, but it looked like people who needed to get out of the way had enough time to do so. I stayed in the back with all the other people whose idea of dancing is bobbing their head along to the song, it was pretty mellow outside of the mosh pit area."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I wish I had a picture of the look on the faces of the two bouncers up at the barriers when Chrigel yelled WALL OF DEATH."
"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I was at what I assume was a classier joint in Louisville for blackguard, metsatoll and tyr and I don't think they ever had a metal show before. We went in and scattered on the floor were tables with candles (yes glass and lit) we were like oh shit. Staff saw the crowd coming and probably thought the same thing. Those were picked up quickly. 

Also same with their faces for wall of death lol"

"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","Sounds like you're in the Windsor area. I want to see this tour when it hits Montreal, but work might be making it impossible for me to go. "

"I'm going to see Eluveitie, Tyr and Metsatöll -- and it's my first metal concert","I have to wonder if I made the right choice. I could have either seen this in two weeks, or seen Skeletonwitch, Sabaton, and Amon Amarth friday. I latched onto the latter, partly because Sabaton has an incredible stage presence, partly because a friend of mine is going, but I've always wanted to see Tyr live."

[""Favorite Kind of Drunk""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdNHZvUzLeI) is of a similar vein, but they sometimes add new verses when they play live so it never gets old!"

"The Dread Crew of Oddwood - When I Sailed [acoustic pirate metal] (2012)","Thought you guys might appreciate this. Completely acoustic, but still metal.

"The Dread Crew of Oddwood - When I Sailed [acoustic pirate metal] (2012)","Just on the chance that you haven't heard them, you should check out Korpiklaani and Alestorm. I'd say several of their songs fit ""bawdy drinking songs.""

Particularly [Rum by Alestorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACNKKPw_iXM)

and [Vodka by Korpiklaani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7kJRGPgvRQ)



"
"The Dread Crew of Oddwood - When I Sailed [acoustic pirate metal] (2012)","Korpiklaani swore off the rowdy drinking songs in their last album though.

It's way better imo ^please ^^don't ^^^kill ^^^^me"
"The Dread Crew of Oddwood - When I Sailed [acoustic pirate metal] (2012)","At some point, you start beating a dead horse. They've done beer, vodka, and tequila. They're Finnish, beer and vodka is a given. Tequila was from how much they enjoyed their first South American tour. They don't have to go on singing about rum, or gin, or anything else alcohol.

I love those songs just as much as I love the others that are more of nature and Finnish lore and history. I'll gladly listen to Suden Joiku and With Trees, but there's many a day where you get home from work, or off the phone after a bad conversation, anything annoying or something like that, and you just want to sit down, or jump all over the place, and blast Vodka, Bring Us Pints of Beer, and Happy Little Boozer and tell everything to fuck off and enjoy yourself."

"The Dread Crew of Oddwood - When I Sailed [acoustic pirate metal] (2012)","I just can't take Pirate Metal serious..."
"The Dread Crew of Oddwood - When I Sailed [acoustic pirate metal] (2012)","Not really a fan of the lead singer. I like what they're doing musically, but he's just not a strong enough singer to make it work well."

"Need some help finding scholarly works regarding folk metal","&gt;  articles in academic journals, academic encyclopedias, scholarly book

I saw Alestorm's headline show in Austin on Thursday, and as part of my History of Rock course at university I need to submit a ""concert report"" on the show. Most of the information the professor is requesting is simple enough to gather (and I still have plenty of time to submit this assignment), but he requires at least three scholarly works that will contextualize folk metal. In addition, he also wants us to highlight any significant social movements or subcultural identity groups that folk metal stands for. Considering folk metal's relative newness, I'm at a loss for where to find any good sources on folk metal and Alestorm. Furthermore, I'm not quite sure if the subgenre belongs to any significant social movements, since a lot of it just seems to be rooted in tradition, but if anyone here has a different opinion, please share!

Finally, anyone know what Alestorm's influences are? Bal-Sagoth is the only thing I'm finding online, but I'd expect some more power metal influences from Chris Bowes.

Thanks for any and all help, guys!"
"Need some help finding scholarly works regarding folk metal","Hope you enjoyed the show! Austin was a pretty wild last night of tour :)

Other influences were Turisas, Korpiklaani, and Rhapsody. Maybe a few other bands here and there, but I had a very limited musical taste. However, since those bands have all recently started turning out crap albums that disappear up their own arseholes, these days they're more of a reference for ""what not to do"" :)

Oh, also our original guitarist (Gavin) was an alexi laiho fanboy, I guess that found its way into some of our guitar parts too."
"Need some help finding scholarly works regarding folk metal","You're right about it being a wild show. I'm just shocked you guys were able to cope so well with the copious softcore porno on the televisions. And I hope you weren't too freaked out by that overzealous girl in the front who kept *grabbing* you.

And thanks for giving me some influences! It'll help tremendously on my assignment."
"Need some help finding scholarly works regarding folk metal","The one who simulated oral sex on our bass player? Yeah that was...unusual.

Happy to help!"
"Need some help finding scholarly works regarding folk metal","Also, I guess it can't hurt to try and page the man himself.../u/hyperchrisz?"
"Need some help finding scholarly works regarding folk metal","Why not look into Running Wild as inspiration and root point for Alestorm and other pirate themes?"
"Need some help finding scholarly works regarding folk metal","We had never heard of running wild when we formed the band, so it wouldn't be correct to call them an influence!"
"Need some help finding scholarly works regarding folk metal","[deleted]"
"Need some help finding scholarly works regarding folk metal","&gt; Running Wild

Running Wild doesn't have the same folk element in their music that was such a big part of Piratefest 2015. I could definitely mention them as far as lyrical themes went, but I honestly think the root of Alestorm's folk elements would be a much more interesting thing to write and read about."

"If you haven't heard of FOLKEARTH, you should! They are an international band, a lineup that frequently changes. Check out their new album from this year!","Yea, sure.

Got started with them in late 2008/early 2009. Just sent an email saying I write music and play guitar, bass and lute (I don't play lute, never even touched one haha). Ended up playing on and writing music for 3 Folkodia and 2 Folkearth albums. It's a great idea but in practice there was just absolutely ZERO quality control (out of tune and time instruments, just plain bad songs, the works) , which explains why the albums will have a couple great songs and then just absolute crap. A massive undertaking to put together, no doubt, but there was seemingly not a great emphasis on putting out great music.

Heaps good experience though!"
"If you haven't heard of FOLKEARTH, you should! They are an international band, a lineup that frequently changes. Check out their new album from this year!","This is definitely spot on. While the out of tune/time stuff has definitely gotten better, my main problem is that I would be given 5+ songs and then expected to have written and recorded them in a week or less which definitely takes some creativity out of some songs. 

Like you said though, the experience is amazing and pretty cool to work with different people all over the world!

"Mystery Song?","One of my friends heard a song I played in my car awhile back and wants to know the name, but neither of us can figure out what song it is. The only thing he knows for certain about it is that it had a female voice chanting in an archaic language. He thinks there might have been harsh vocals. The only folk music I had at the time was Eluveitie and Arkona, so it has to be a song by one of them. Any ideas?

Songs we've eliminated:

**Eluveitie:**
Celtos,
Dessumiis Luge,
Luxtos,
Siraxta


**Arkona:**
Zimushka,
Odna,
V Tsepiakh Drevney Tainy,
Kupalets"
"Mystery Song?","Female voice chanting in an archaic language plus harsh vocals sounds very much like [Slania's Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx_8HBTsgGs) to me... maybe? Or [Siraxta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyHCV9TIlS4).

If not, you could try the Evocation album. It's mostly in Gaulish with Anna's vocals.

If it was actually Arkona, your description fits basically every song... maybe start with the most popular ones on youtube or so, like Yarilo, Stenka na Stenku, Goi Rode Goi, Liki Bessmertnykh Bogov or Slavsia Rus."
"Mystery Song?","He listened to Evocation in its entirety and nothing."
"Mystery Song?","How do you know that it was an archaic language if you don't remember which language it was?"
"Mystery Song?","Arkona has harsh and clean vocals both by Masha.  Eluveitie has occasionaly clean vocals by Anna and more frequent harsh vocals by the frontman dude.  If your friend remembers whether the harsh vocals sounded masculine or feminine that could cut out one band or the other.

Statistically speaking, it was probably Arkona.  From what I've heard they tend to have a more even ratio of clean and harsh vocals in their songs.

[Was it this one?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgXlUxDGFvU)"
"Mystery Song?","No, it wasn't Liki Bessmertnykh Bogov."
"Mystery Song?","lol, I don't think a single person I know thought Masha's harsh vocals sounded ""feminine"" before knowing she was singing them..."
"Mystery Song?","You can't hear it?  They sound much higher and more like her clean singing voice than say Johan's growls.  Typically everyone's growls sound a lot more like their real voices than we tend to realize, mainly because not many singers use both."
"Mystery Song?","I can for sure, but almost everyone upon first listening assumes it is a guy or that they have multiple singers. On comparison with others, it is much easier but I doubt anyone would hear without prior knowledge and just know they are female- and this person barely even knows the music :p"
"Mystery Song?","Yeah I never got to listen to Arkona without knowing Masha did all the vocals.  Her growls just sound feminine to me.  I much prefer them to Arch Enemy's female growls, which sound to me like she's trying to sound as masculine as possible."
"Mystery Song?","Do you have a rough idea of how long the song was?"
"Mystery Song?","No."
"Mystery Song?","Which albums did you have by each band at the time?"
"Mystery Song?","A couple possibilities from Arkona, could probably do better if I knew exactly what is meant by ""chanting"" and if you had the entire Arkona discography at the time:
Zaklyate; Goi, Rode Goi! acoustic version, Noviy Mir (Shaman cover); Duren' (Svarga cover); Na Svarogovoy Doroge; Arkaim?"

"Folk Metal with Hurdy Gurdy?","is cool brah"
"Folk Metal with Hurdy Gurdy?","I think they sound amazing if it is focused on them. I have a list of bands using them:

[Nachtgeschrei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omL_PdW94cE) [(new singer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0h9eEiaBe8) is my personal favourite for hurdy gurdy music. They have one that plays only hurdy gurdy and sometimes [accordeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpN3Wj2dfa0).

[Ignis Fatuu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz-6oYzeN-E) The hurdy gurdy switches with the bagpipes and violin. This song is one with one.

Saltatio Mortis in some of their songs but I can't one with it. it disappears a bit under the bag pipes usually.

[In Extremo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaS9kDZddfQ). Not all songs but I would say ~30% atleast.

[Subway to Sally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykNo8ithVJ4) 

And ofcourse there is [Schandmaul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3BsXKcqF3g)"
"Folk Metal with Hurdy Gurdy?","[deleted]"
"Folk Metal with Hurdy Gurdy?","I don't know too many, I always kind of thought the hurdy gurdy was Eluveitie's thing. I don't think there's many who use it as heavily as they do."

"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","I'm going to be interviewing Faroese folk metal masters Tyr on Tuesday in Chicgao. Let me know if there is something you want me to ask the and I'll do my best to get an answer for you.

Update: I interviewed Tyr's bassist Gunnar and was able to ask, or at least bring up, most of your questions.

I will be playing the interview tonight in two parts: Part 1 at 1:00AM, Part 2 at 2:00AM

Listen live on iHeartRadio (station: WONC), www.wonc.org, or www.tunein.com/radio/Metal-Oxide-p68388

Update again: Interview uploaded on YouTube: http://youtu.be/5PMenh2YDtU"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","I would like to know if they ever intend on doing more on the lines of ""Eric the Red"" or ""Ragnarok"" again composition-wise, I really like ""The Edge"" in particular."
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","Ha, that's exactly what I was going to ask myself.

I wouldn't expect a full album, but a song or two on each new album would be awesome. When I first heard By the Light of the Northern Star, I loved it... but with 3 albums of that now, I really miss the Eric the Red style."
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","Could you perhaps elaborate a bit? Don't get me wrong, ""The Edge"" is one of my favorite songs of theirs, the song that actually got me into Tyr in the first place. The only problem is, unless you can be more specific, the answer is probably as simple as that Heri's song writing has changed. I just want to make sure I do your question justice.

"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","Damn, sorry I'm late with this, but I guess the thing would be songwriting and album progression. There were choruses, but the verses were diverse.  This is opposed to their more recent songwriting style which relies on catchy repeated riffs, and less on dynamic song structure.  I still like Týr, but damn do I wish they would go back to the more progressive song structure.  It added a whole new element of storytelling that you just can't grasp with the verse-prechorus-chorus-verse style with similar verses.  I guess the best way, from a songwriting perspective, to describe it would be that the chorus resolved and transitioned the verses rather than the verses leading up to the chorus.  More emphasis on verse and other structures or whatever you want to call it."
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","No worries. I still was able to ask, so you'll have to see what Gunnar said about it!"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","I was able to get an answer for you from Gunnar.

"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","[deleted]"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","Shadow of the Swastika is often held up as an example of what a lot of Scandinavian metal, folk metal and of course, Tyr, is not about.

Is there a song in particular you'd hold up as representing what Tyr *is* about, and why?

And, on a tangent, if you had a mate who has never heard folk metal, what song by anyone would you start them off on to ensure their corruption ;) ?

Edit: and how awesome do you think Solstafir are? [dont feel compelled to ask that one lol :p]"

"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","I've uploaded the interview on youtube: http://youtu.be/5PMenh2YDtU"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","I know that they remade Hail to the Hammer once Heri was made lead singer - I'd like to know if they ever plan on remaking any of the other ones (most hopefully, How Far To Asgaard)

also, if they ever plan on making acoustic/""unplugged"" versions of any of their songs (i'd love an acoustic of Evening Star)"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","Hah! I was already going to ask them about rerecording some of their older songs. Great question!"

"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","I've uploaded the interview on youtube: http://youtu.be/5PMenh2YDtU"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","If there's any chances of them playing songs from the first few albums when on tour. The last few tours haven't had enough :|


Don't get me wrong, the new stuff is great-- I just leave a little disappointed when I don't hear anything off *Eric the Red*, *Land* or *Ragnarok*."
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","I'll see about asking him, though I've asked him this before. Unfortunately it is a matter of playing new songs, a lack of time, and playing songs for both old and new fans. A song like Land, even though Heri said it's the one song he wishes he could ever play live, will most likely never be played on tour. On this tour, I can tell you its all about time--they only have five songs to play since they're an opener, and since they have a new album out, those will be mostly new songs. I will be sure to include your interest though when I ask him about an upcoming headlning tour, which will hopefully be soon. "
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","That makes sense. Thanks for the response!

I look forward to hearing what they might have to say."
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","Heri said that about Land?  That's my very favorite song of all time.  I'm glad that he even wants to play it, because maybe things will happen someday..."
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","I'm pretty sure once they get longer sets again, they'll start adding stuff like Ramund Hin Unge and Sinklars Visa back."
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","Oh they will. Gunnar mentions in the interview that they are looking to come back in (hopefully) a year or so and play for more like an hour and half, than a half hour like they did this time, hoping to include much more old stuff in their set. Check out my interview tonight! I've linked listening methods in the post body."

"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","You're the man! Thanks!"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","1. Why does Heri Joensen go under the guise of ""fervently Asatru"" when he's actually atheist?
2. When will Tyr (or any folk metal band for that matter) tour anywhere near the south in the US"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","The touring in the South thing has actually come up in other interviews I've done with bands like Tyr. Apparently there just isn't enough pull down there to get bands to tour there. 

edit: I forgot to log in an reply with my show's account..."
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","I think part of that is just connections and awareness. For years lots of metal bands skipped Brisbane Australia, just doing Sydney/Melbourne.

Last few years had Moonsorrow, Korpiklaani, Eluveitie, Russian Circles, Animals as Leaders, Kvelertak and others touring. Often attached to major festivals, and usually perform at same 2-3 venues."
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","I just went to a show they played in Dallas on the 11th of this month"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","I was there, front row.  Met Heri afterwards, too!"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","Hell yeah! My boyfriend and I were in the best box seats available, had to get box since my spine is fractured and it is really unsafe for me to be in a closely-packed crowd like that. I got to give Terji a hug and it was kind of the best moment of my life"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","You probably saw me in the front row, fisting pumping and head banging like crazy while all the high school Children of Bodom fans stood there like wtf?"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","I think it's a way for them, and other bands, to distance themselves from Christianity because they view it as an evil that was forced upon the people to subjugate them, which is arguably the reason a lot of the Scandinavian countries were converted nearing the end of the Viking age, and also because it threatened their cultural heritage."
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","Heri has never come across as Asatru at all.  People get confused because Tyr is a bit more openly atheist than most bands, but you'll hear Johan Hegg and Sammi Hinkka saying exactly the same things about old pagan religions.  There aren't any major bands in folk metal (that I am aware of) that are actually Asatru or Wiccan or anything like.

Definition of 'heathen', according to some random online dictionary: an unconverted individual of a people that do not acknowledge the God of the Bible; a person who is neither a Jew, Christian, nor Muslim"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","[deleted]"
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","Unfortunately I wasn't able to interview Heri this time around. You should still check out my interview tonight with Gunnar, using the links I've provided in the post body to listen live."
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","He doesn't. He uses the Viking Myths and Folklore as metaphor, They are cultural heritage and he doesn't believe in supressing cultural heritage for religious reasons.

Also Tyr just played Atlanta with Death angel and Cob."
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","Ask him how Heljaryega is coming along.  For everyone who misses Tyr's old Ragnarok sound, try out some of Heri's [side project band Heljaryega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BfZPy3wMeo).  It has all the proggy elements of old Tyr with the higher production value and super intricate melodies of new Tyr.

Tyr is still my favorite band, but I expect that as Heljareyga's discography increases, they will usurp that position.

Also, Tyr's new drummer Amon Djurhuss Elinsgaard is the drummer for Heljareyga."
"Tyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?","Unfortunately I did not interview Heri so I couldn't ask about Heljareyga. Last time they were here though I was able to interview Heri and ask him about Heljareyga: https://soundcloud.com/metaloxide/interview-heri-joensen

I wouldnt sat Time I is mediocre, not only musicians can have opionions, but just saying it is mediocre is not telling your opionion to its fullest extent. Time I is just really heavily mixed with synth and vocals layered and edited all over the place, and the eastern style percussions on the intro, amazing. Hey its no pinacle creation of its day, but its for from mediocre, unless you can be convincing in your argument, your opionion is worthlesd to others."

Their sound is quite varied, so even now, I feel like I didn't give them the proper representation.  I don't understand why they're not all over reddit.

"Folk metal enthusiasts. Having such a fine taste for good metal, what are some other great metal bands that aren't ""folk""?","Korpiklaani and Arkona are some of the most seminal and influential folk metal bands out there.  Alestorm is power with folk influences targeted towards a folk audience, and Skalmold is melodeath with folk influences, targeted at a folk audience."
"Folk metal enthusiasts. Having such a fine taste for good metal, what are some other great metal bands that aren't ""folk""?","Oh well...
Nekrogoblikon and Mechanism are some good ones then."
"Folk metal enthusiasts. Having such a fine taste for good metal, what are some other great metal bands that aren't ""folk""?","Nekrogoblikon!

Edit: because I feel bad for shouting down your suggestions, they were all really good.  I just think they weren't un-folk enough to be included here.  I'm glad to see Skalmold getting attention actually, if OP doesn't listen to them already he should."
"Folk metal enthusiasts. Having such a fine taste for good metal, what are some other great metal bands that aren't ""folk""?","Yeah, I did realize that I've added bands that have folk metal ties but I couldn't help myself! I really like them! It was foolish really.

No worries though man, I do realize why I was corrected. Skálmöld as been my favorite band for almost a year now. I just love the Icelandic, the norse mythology in practically every song. Awesome.

My friend got me into Nekrogoblikon a while ago.. damn they are good and pretty funny as well."
"Folk metal enthusiasts. Having such a fine taste for good metal, what are some other great metal bands that aren't ""folk""?","No worries, I didn't think Skalmold was folk until I heard their first album, which is a lot more folky than the second."

"Looking for a band that uses a Sitar in their music? Any suggestions?","Not sure if it qualifies as folk, but some [Orphaned Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zf2xMbSSy4)  songs have Sitar."
"Looking for a band that uses a Sitar in their music? Any suggestions?","You can use a Google [site search](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:http://www.metal-archives.com/bands+sitar) to glean some info from Encyclopedia Metallum.  Not perfect, and not limited to folk metal, but gives you a few things to look into."
"Looking for a band that uses a Sitar in their music? Any suggestions?","Without knowing a whole lot about sitars, I think an instrument used by The Firstborn in a lot of songs might be a sitar.

"SKÁLMÖLD will host an AMA at /r/epicmetal: September 30th at 10pm GMT/6pm EST","I definitely wouldn't say a better fit, as /r/epicmetal is not limited to genre so Skalmold's style is just as fitting as it would be elsewhere.

"Where to begin with folk metal?","I absolutely love folk metal. The problem is, a lot of it is very difficult to find (different languages, etc.)

So I want to get a bunch folk metal to add to my lacking inventory of the genre. 

My current favorite folk metal are things like:

* Ensiferum
* Wintersun
* Dalriada
* Alestorm (pirate metal)
* Schaundmaul (not metal, but very folky)
* Turisas
* Falconer

---

I also like slower folk songs like Nightwish's **The Islander**.

I prefer clean vocals, but if it has enough folk elements like Ensiferum or Dalriada, I'm perfectly fine with harsh vocals."
"Where to begin with folk metal?","I would recommend Korpiklaani and Arkona."
"Where to begin with folk metal?","Oh god Arkona is perfect"
"Where to begin with folk metal?","You should try listening to: Wolfchant, Heidevolk, Metsatoll, Tyr, Finntroll, Equilibrium (more like ""epic""/symphonic metal, but still folky enough you'd like it most likely), Eluveitie, and maybe Brymir (same deal as Equilibrium but you may enjoy it, folky themes still).

I can post a song for each, if that would help.

Wolfchant - [Stormwolves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hlo-H0OBTE)

Heidevolk - [Een Nieuw Begin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhTZmpxh_so)

Metsatöll - [Küü](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q3-uv1CPH4)

Equilibrium - [Waldschrein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHy81GG6k2o)

Eluveitie - [Inis Mona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iijKLHCQw5o)

Brymir - [Unconquerable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0XdgTq7jU)



EDIT: Also, most of these bands use harsh vocals, but they are all quite folky so you may not mind it.

EDIT 2: Oh! Almost forgot. Nine Treasures - [Nuutsai Chadal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa7PfYfmoEo)

Their vocals are ""harsh clean"", if that makes sense, he sort of mixes a throat-singing sound with regular singing and it sounds pretty awesome.
"
"Where to begin with folk metal?","To expand on that (fantastic) list:

Finsterforst - [Sturmes Ernte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuSAzsLDZ4)

"Where to begin with folk metal?","You actually gave me a few new bands to look at there, thanks!"
"Where to begin with folk metal?","No problem, theres more of it in the folk metal spotify list!   
  
([Link](http://open.spotify.com/user/1113926922/playlist/3BTUkWZk2lpBMXnI64gy0O) for the lazy)"
"Where to begin with folk metal?","Is Finsterforst's vocalist Equilibrium's old singer? The voice sounds very familiar..."
"Where to begin with folk metal?","No, but you're right, the vocals are quite similar. Finsterforst changed their vocalist for the last two albums though, so the album ""Rastlos"" and the new one that will come out soon have a different vocalist anyway ;)  
Their trademark, the accordeon, is in every album though, which is what I love most about them."
"Where to begin with folk metal?","Ahh, okay, nice!"
"Where to begin with folk metal?","To edit on all that, I forgot one band I really enjoyed this last week: Nightcreepers!

Nightcreepers - [Frozen Outland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws9JRFcy-_k)  
If you don't like the part that starts at around 1:05, then the above list is probably not for you."
"Where to begin with folk metal?","I too like clean vocals in my folk metal.

All of the above suggestions are great and you should also check out Tyr if you haven't already"
"Where to begin with folk metal?","Where to start with Folk Metal? Why, where it all started of course!

**Skyclad** - [Think Back and Lie of England](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dLARkGkMbM) [Building a Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3YXTAovqZs) [The Well Travelled Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOwxjxEwZgA) 

As for the rest, it seems like you're a bit into power metal (Falconer and Alestorm), and I don't know exactly how familiar you are with that genre. As such, I'll just give a few (folky) recommendations.

**Elvenking** - [The Loser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgzlOMVyL2g)

**Blind Guardian** - [Skalds and Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3_S1Q40HZo) (Rather Falconer-y, I think)

**Wuthering Heights** - [Too Great Thy Gift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO4b3CPI0vo)

(We'veI've got plenty more at r/PowerMetal if you're interested :D)

Next, we'll address Schaundmaul. So, Mittelalter-Rock/Metal is awesome, not sure how much of it you are aware of, but:

**Faun** - [Diese kalte Nacht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGuY3Nin8yU) [Tanz mit mir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYKveN9Vj3M)

**Saltatio Mortis** - [Wachstum über alles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTSitlFXEX8) [Früher war alles besser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8yF9zqlpR4) [Hochzeitstanz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouhufx2En4Y) (Alea has the worst hair ever, but whatever :D)

**Santiano** - [Garten Eden / Scarborough Faire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqjL0j5N3l8)

"
"Where to begin with folk metal?","On the medieval point -Subway To Sally. I'm not sure what I'd recommend to start at though. The first song I heard by them was Wehe Stunde. (Thanks to some streaming radio app a few years ago.)

If you like Faun, Saltatio Mortis, and such you will *probably* like Subway To Sally.

I just got into the more medieval stuff (via listening to Faun for awhile) a few months ago. The amount of new music you can find on streaming radio is amazing, depending on the app.

Oh yeah, if you're talking about the lead singer in Saltatio Mortis, yeah...I agree on awful hair, but the music is great. (I don't know the name of anyone in that band.)"
"Where to begin with folk metal?","Ok, along the Medieval (or mittelalter in German) lines: Corvus Corax, Cultus Ferox, Schelmish, Dunkelschön, Potentia Animi, WirrWahr, Wolfenmond, Haggard, maybe even Tanzwut or Heimataerde (more electronic, but still folky).  In Extremo should probably be mentioned.  And, these are not medieval per se, but I would be remiss to leave out: Garmarna, Lumsk and Fejd."
"Where to begin with folk metal?","you are the only one to mention elvenking, why is that?  they were my introduction to folk metal and they are still one of my faves.  is it just because of how iffy some of their rescent entries have been? "
"Where to begin with folk metal?","For the most part, Elvenking is just power metal with violin. In general, it seems like most of r/folkmetal prefers music that is more like Metatsoll or Ensiferum. Less power and more atmospheric, in my experience."
"Where to begin with folk metal?","yeah, i definitely get that from their last few albums.  but heathenreel and wyvern seem like really great albums for someone just starting in the genre to me."
"Where to begin with folk metal?","Tyr is a really good one.

I actually started with Eluveitie and I hated harsh vocals back then. Listen to Arcane Evocation I which is acoustic and Anna Murphy does all the vocals. Then some songs which feature Anna's vocals (clean). Here's a list starting with 100% Anna's vocals too more of a balance between Anna and Chrigel (harsh vocals):

Call if the Mountains
A Rose For Epona
Vianna
Alesia
Celtos
Slania's Song (Gaulish)
Luxtos

(There are obviously more but those are the notable ones to me)

I ended up loving the rest of Eluveitie's song that the harsh vocals grew on me (and I detested them before).

EDIT: typos"
"Where to begin with folk metal?","I'd suggest Heidevolk and Metsatöll. You also may like Eluveitie, although they do have harsh vocals, but also much in the ways of folk elements. "
"Where to begin with folk metal?","You wish you understood Heidevolk. Nederland meesterland. "
"Where to begin with folk metal?","What? "
"Where to begin with folk metal?","Not sure what this subreddit's general opinion of them is, but [Suidakra.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwgf5kRPNDo) Healthy mix of growls/screams and clean singing. [Here's a somewhat heavier track, too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ-4-tALTbw)."
"Where to begin with folk metal?","If you like clean vocals I would also advise you to listen to Lumsk. Their latest album is less folk-ish, so you may prefer listening first to Det Vilde Kor and Troll."
"Where to begin with folk metal?","If you enjoy Schaundmaul, you should check out Faun. They are alsonot metal but very folky. Also since IM assuming the obvious ones like Korpiklaani and Eluviete are already being mentioned, let me suggest Tengger cavalry."
"Where to begin with folk metal?","You have a good start.  It's definitely good to cast your net wide and go around the world.

From Finland, Korpiklaani and Finntroll are the godfathers of that country's scene and are must haves.  Also crucial to any folk metaller collection is Moonsorrow's ""V: Hävitetty"" album.  The atmosphere of that album (two songs, roughly 30 mins apiece) is fantastic, and its sheer awesomeness should mitigate any aversion to the vocal style. 

From across the bay in Estonia, Metsatöll is like a gnarlier and groovier Korpiklaani.  Lots of fun live

From the rest of Scandinavia you get more of the Viking stuff.  TYR is definitely where you want to go here.  If you end up liking Moonsorrow, go for Thyrfing.  And to go old school, check out Bathory's ""Hammerheart"", which is the fountainhead of Viking metal.

Germany has a big folk metal scene.  Falkenbach is a great viking outfit.  Equilibrium from Munich does big heroic folk, definitely start with their ""Turis Fratyr"" album.

From Israel, start with Orphaned Land: great, proggy Middle Eastern-influenced metal with a very awesome theme.  Arafel plays real aggressive Russian/Ukrainian-influenced music, and I can't get enough of their newest album with Equilibrium's former vocalist.  Melechesh is not strictly folk, but its heavily Armenian/Assyrian folk-influenced black metal is pretty awesome you're in the mood for that.

Though I was into them for awhile, I've gone cool on Eluveitie.  Primordial from Ireland is better Celtic folk, imho.

Also good: Skyforger (Latvia), Mägo de Oz (Spain), and Agalloch (Oregon).  Enjoy!"
"Where to begin with folk metal?","Equilibrium and Wintersun are a must although they breach genres. Both are incredibly symphonic and epic. Check out Time I for Wintersun and Sagas or Erdentempel for Equilibrium"
"Where to begin with folk metal?","Falkenbach

"Where to begin with folk metal?","Try Jonne, the solo album from the vocalist of korpiklaani. Very folky."

"Where to begin with folk metal?","[Northland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3UhN6mTU4k), [Nordheim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Fj6JC0NN0), and [Waylander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpPMmhmmMdk) are good. Finding new folk metal can be challenging."

"Where to begin with folk metal?","Nobody has mentioned Folkearth?!

Folkearth is an international music project created in 2003 by musicians playing folk and viking metal. The name (folk + earth) symbolizes musicians from all over the world playing folk music. Their 2nd album was a collaboration of about 30 musicians from 8 different countries.

Here is a link to 2 songs from them. IMO, their albums between 2004 &amp;amp; 2008 are the best.

Spears ahead, on the verge . Sets of the monastery roof the red cockerel! Spears ahead, on the verge . Sets on church roof the red cockerel!
Leads us to the wild rider . Hey ho ho yes ! A sun in his Fahn . Hey yes ho ho ho ho !
Spears ahead, on the verge . Sets of the monastery roof the red cockerel! Spears ahead, on the verge . Sets on church roof the red cockerel!
At the church gate there is fire and stink. Hey ho ho yes ! Many jumped over uns're blade. Hey yes ho ho ho ho !
Spears ahead, on the verge . Sets of the monastery roof the red cockerel! Spears ahead, on the verge . Sets on church roof the red cockerel!
Oh Father Thor , bless thee we . Hey ho ho yes ! Here burns Germania's determined pride. Hey yes ho ho ho ho !
Spears ahead, on the verge . Sets of the monastery roof the red cockerel! Spears ahead, on the verge . Sets on church roof the red cockerel!
Give us the victory , in the moon's glow . Hey ho ho yes ! We smash everything to pieces . Hey yes ho ho ho ho !
Spears ahead, on the verge . Sets of the monastery roof the red cockerel! Spears ahead, on the verge . Sets on church roof the red cockerel!

"Maverick Hunter- Black Ocean Overflow (Freaking cowboy metal finally)","Harsh. And I didn't hate them. Just not really my thing. I'm gonna check out the other songs for sure though. Yeah, it's definitely a cool genre and I think it can grow on me. I didn't like Finntroll or Amon Amarth for a good while, but I came around."
"Maverick Hunter- Black Ocean Overflow (Freaking cowboy metal finally)","Same here. I really disliked and even hated them when i first heard them but now FinnTroll is easily my favorite band of all time.

Funny how metal grows on you like that. It's different from other genres. Other genres, like pop, are pretty much designed so that the listener instantly likes it, so that the song catches in the brain and stays there. It requires no effort or input from the listener because the music is essentially ""engineered"" to be pleasing. It is equivalent to a fast-food cheeseburger, just straight what the brain is craving, no digestion or nutrients required.

Metal on the other hand is thai food cooked in a five star restaurant. An extremely acquired taste that demands the consumer is knowledgeable and accustomed to the possible experience. The first time they taste it, they might not like it but on subsequent tastings they grow fond of it."
"Maverick Hunter- Black Ocean Overflow (Freaking cowboy metal finally)","hah that's perfect. 100% agree about the pop music. though I do enjoy my fast food here and there lol, but not pop music."
"Maverick Hunter- Black Ocean Overflow (Freaking cowboy metal finally)","I'm a full time student and I still have to work a little so unfortunately fast food is a big part of my life : ("
"Maverick Hunter- Black Ocean Overflow (Freaking cowboy metal finally)","I'm liking it but I don't hear the cowboy part. I was expecting along the lines of Dezperadoz."
"Maverick Hunter- Black Ocean Overflow (Freaking cowboy metal finally)","I'd have to agree.  My original sentiment was ""Amazing how ""Cowboy metal"" sounds exactly the same as European Folk metal.""  

I'm not particularly a fan of all these  ""new genres"" purely based around lyrical themes.  I personally think a genre should define the sound and not the themes.  For instance; Alestorm, while called ""Pirate metal"" are undoubtedly pure folk metal while singing about pirates.  

This band are good and I did enjoy the song enough to watch another video of theirs.  It sounds a lot like Wintersun from their first album or Ensiferum.  Definitely not a bad thing."
"Maverick Hunter- Black Ocean Overflow (Freaking cowboy metal finally)","I'm all for new genres. Dezperadoz does the cowboy thing quite well, a nice mix of twang and german thrash. I would LOVE to hear more Chet Atkins kind of stuff mixed with a power metal sound."
"Maverick Hunter- Black Ocean Overflow (Freaking cowboy metal finally)","I agree to an extent but I think the genre that defines a band is established by the fans, not the band.  I think almost all musicians and bands strive to be unique and part of that is to say ""Hey, we're not just folk metal, we're Cowboy Metal!"" in order to differentiate themselves from the pack.  But a lot of the time, their music DOES fit into pre-existing genres, yet most musicians feel that falling into an already existing category is some sort of musical conformity.  

Genres are MASSIVE.  Not all power metal sounds the same.  Who can say that all Symphonic metal bands play the exact same style of music?  If anything these genres allow us to categorize different sounds so that we can find similar music that we enjoy.  

As a composer myself, I used to constantly think that I had to create some amazing new genre in order to be unique.  That's not the case.  You don't have to decide that your Gothic Metal is actually ""Blackened Doom Symphonic Goth Metal"" because Gothic Metal is a massive genre which already covers all the features of your music.  

This has really strayed from the point and become more of a comment on the desire of bands to try and make themselves unique when they don't have to.  A pre-defined genre shouldn't cripple your music, but instead attract fans of that style.  Genres aren't scary monsters musicians should run away from, but instead something to embrace.

Anyway, I'm off to work now; have a nice day :)

Which got me thinking - take those bands a step further and you'd be in folk metal country. So is there any Appalachian folk metal (Appalachian derived music in particular)?

Banjo, fiddle, mandolin and American roots music?"
"Appalachian folk metal","In my experience, the closest thing there is to a blend of American roots music and metal is  Falls of Rauros, particularly ""March of the Valorous Bane."" It has fairly folk-y style that's more akin to American folk than European. 

I'd also suggest Thayer Cabin's [""In the Town of Bloodpine""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM7wsFMwwEE). The instrumentation isn't really metal, but I'd argue the songwriting is. "
"Appalachian folk metal","I see what you mean. Kinda overlaps with some spaghetti western desert rock stuff like Spindrift's Legend of God's Gun."
"Appalachian folk metal","Wow, Thayer Cabin is freakin dope. Got any more stuff like that?"

"Appalachian folk metal","Start something. While my experience with Bluegrass is limited, I'm a huge fan of Woody, Pete and Ramblin' Jack. Love to hear an Americana influenced metal band.

A couple years back I was tooling around on Youtube and happened upon a pagan/viking/black metal music video, from I think Estonia or around around that region. I can't remember the band, or the name. Any help?

Here's what I know:

* there was a group of people (not band members), stomping in rhythm like in a pagan ritual, I think around a large rock or the band
* at one point people were in a trance like state and then lying on the ground and shaking. 
* I'm pretty sure the vocals were pretty harsh, as I didn't like it at the time.
* I think the band is from Estonia or thereabouts, and are considered pagan metal

Any help is greatly appreciated!"

"[Request] Folk Melodic Death Metal with Traditional instruments?","Basically my favourite bands of the genre are Ensiferum, Equilibrium and Furor Gallico. I also love Svartsot's Maledictus Eris and Krampus' Survival of the Fittest. What they all have in common is that they all use traditional instruments and they aren't too ""metalcore"" or even chuggy death metal. It's very melodic. With Eluveitie I found there's too many dull passages with just heavy guitar riffage, aggressive drums and nothing much else going on. 

Are there any really good bands similar to those I mentioned above that I might have overlooked? Preferably with deep grunts but very melodic instumentals. Clean vocals just don't do it for me I'm afraid."
"[Request] Folk Melodic Death Metal with Traditional instruments?","Eluveitie's latest release,  ""King"", from the upcoming album is a perfect example. Overall it's ok, not amazing. Then around half way through the song there is a 45 second portion that is phenomenal. They need to mix the folk stuff in more regularly. 

Try korpiklaani (stuff from their middle years is easily my favorite), finntroll, and northland.  On the cleaner vocal + less metal side: some Dalriada (try the Ígéret album), Arkona, and Tyr. Some of that is on the lighter side, but we are talking about a small-ish subgenre here.

For some reason I keep wanting to say Amon Amarth. No traditional instruments, but the sound just kind of fits in with the heavier folk metal bands. Definitely one of my favorites."
"[Request] Folk Melodic Death Metal with Traditional instruments?","Yeah I do like their latest track but most of Eluveitie's music I find a bit too aggressive like I said in the OP, plus I'm not keen on female vocals for the most part.

Korpiklaani haven't got any grunts and that's what I like to hear :P. I do like some FInntroll and I love Northland. 

Of course I know Amon Amarth haha I've not lived under a rock for years. They're a bit too simple and samey for my tastes personally."
"[Request] Folk Melodic Death Metal with Traditional instruments?","Try Wolfchant. Their album A Pagan Storm is a great album for what your looking for. "
"[Request] Folk Melodic Death Metal with Traditional instruments?","Yeah they seem pretty good but I've never got into them. I'll give em another go around."
"[Request] Folk Melodic Death Metal with Traditional instruments?","Idk if Heidevolk fit your needs, but their earlier stuff is pretty kickass, and since they sing in Dutch it doesn't sound like clean vocals at all!"

"[Request] Folk Melodic Death Metal with Traditional instruments?","The Last Desperate 10 Years As Ever is a pretty good melodic death metal album using Korean traditional instruments, by Oathean - an otherwise mediocre band.

"[Request] Folk Melodic Death Metal with Traditional instruments?","You can look at [Tengger Cavalry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxXxx-_GNbA) but they're Chinese and influenced by traditional Mongolian music rather than pagan or Celtic, etc. sounding influences so it's likely they might not be your thing at all.

"Ensiferum - Ahti","Was not expecting an intricate story line. Awesome video!"
"Ensiferum - Ahti","Don't get me wrong, i'm a huge Ensiferum fan, but this song and pretty much everything they released since victory song is a huge disappointment for me, I feel like they're leaving the sound and the atmosphere that sold them to me many years ago. I would still see them on tour if they come in my area though, they're absolutely fantastic live!"
"Ensiferum - Ahti","To me, From Afar and on (Jariless Ensiferum) does not have the same feel. Victory songs was an amazing album in my opinion, Especially Victory Song. "
"Ensiferum - Ahti","I've really enjoyed everything up through From Afar (and it might be my favorite Ensiferum album), but I agree that it has a very different feel from the albums before it. "

"Aether Realm - The Magician [New Release]","Kinda reminds me of old Ensiferum, sounds great! Love the logo, too: the illegibility of death metal, but it's made of roots so it's folky at the same time. Awesome.

Edit: those last few seconds.... "
"Aether Realm - The Magician [New Release]","I'm assuming that won't make the album haha.  
  
If you follow their Facebook you'll find they don't take themselves too seriously. Or seriously at all for that matter."
"Aether Realm - The Magician [New Release]","I love how they explicitly state on their facebook page:

WE ARE NOT FROM FINLAND"
"Aether Realm - The Magician [New Release]","They're awesome guys too. I'm from PA, and got to hang out with them on their first and second east coast tour. Then I drove to Virginia with some friends when I saw they were opening for Turisas. They put on an awesome show and will go out of their way to hang out with their fans. "

You can also probably steal it without too much trouble if you live in a box or whatever."
"Slechtvalk - Forsaken","While this song doesn't have any folk elements to its sound (and if that is grounds to remove this post, then by all means do so), it does, however, have a rather realistic viewpoint on what I think Viking Age Scandinavians were feeling during their Christianization. Plus, its damn fine black metal if you can get passed the Christian influence in it.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_WMhcBF2QM"

"Valkyrja streaming in all its glorious entirety here.","The full album leaked at least three days ago, so if someone wanted to pirate it they probably have done so already."
"Valkyrja streaming in all its glorious entirety here.","I had trouble getting into Tyr before but this is really really good. Will purchase when I can."
"Valkyrja streaming in all its glorious entirety here.","They shifted away from the doomy epic style (which I actually preferred, that was how they became my favorite band) and into a more direct, aggressive tone.  It's much better than Lay of Thrym IMO."
"Valkyrja streaming in all its glorious entirety here.","Thanks mate.  Love Tyr and will hopefully be picking this one up soon."

"Arkona to headline a tour of North America","Yeah, this is interesting because I don't see anything that says they have approved Visas (according to Play America) but they did play on the 70000 Tons cruise in January 2013 and I'm not sure how long those Visas are good for (you do need a P-1B to play the cruise).

P1-Bs are only valid for one year but they could have requested an additional one year extension. Either way, they have very little time to get this all in order. I just hope they've sent their paperwork in.

They deserve a headlining tour. They're one of the best live bands out there. Cannot wait to catch them again."

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/folkmetal/comments/152e39/folk_metal_bands_that_use_a_nykelharpa/) post mentioned a few groups that use it, and can be seen in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U10ftE4XQvo) **(NSFW)** video from Faun (more folk music).

"Ayreon - Patterns (Prog metal album, folk influences, instrumental)","Great that you are interested in this band (or artist, actually). The last album featured A LOT of famous guest artists of Yes,, Emerson, Lake and Palmer,, Genesis,, King Krimson,, Nightwish,, Kamelot,, Lacuna Coil, Grand Magnus and a fuckton more artists. (the list is from an advert in a music magazine I'm subscribed to). Many of his albums (excluding this one) have a big story that goes on from album to album. Though this album is just 'purely scientific themes', his earlier albums were more 'science fiction oriented' (I read up a lot in the article that was also featured in that magazine, other than just the ad.) "

What would you say were your influences? Golden Spirit reminds me of Hollenthon. Are you familiar with them?"
"Hey guys! My folk metal band just released our first ep. Have a listen and tell us what you think!","I'm not. But I will definitely check them out. Our influences vary a bit. The singer and the other guitarist and I all came from an extreme metal background. But we all felt like doing something different. So this happened. The violinist is classically trained and listens to pretty much everything, but makes he's own electronic music. So the influences are from everywhere. But we tried to keep it as a different take on how we used to make music. Thanks man!"
