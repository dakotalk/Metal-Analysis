"Does r/grindcore love Beaten To Death like I do?","Yes."
"Does r/grindcore love Beaten To Death like I do?","Yup, very much so! "
"Waste - FYD",""
"Riff-oriented grindcore","Maybe misleading title but I've listened to some insect warfare and I dig their sound but I think I'm looking for something that's not quite grindcore - those guys have some riffs tat kick ass, I'm just looking for something as heavy but less spastic. Any suggestions?"
"Riff-oriented grindcore","Let me guess you've heard Nasum? The best of all worlds."
"Riff-oriented grindcore","I haven't but I suppose this means I need to."
"Riff-oriented grindcore","Yes, and I'll be happy to give you a few links.

"Riff-oriented grindcore"," Nasum are like the perfect band for me and I acknowledge their greatness but the clean, layered production and vocal style kills it for me."
"Riff-oriented grindcore","Have you heard their earlier work? Cause there is a big difference in production from their first works to their latest (which is starting to get old by now). 

But I understand what you mean, seems like people either like their grindcore a little sludgier and filthier, whilst some like the ""new-era"" like Nasum, Rotten Sound, Gadget and that type of cleaner but perhaps faster grindcore. I have a hard time enjoying for instance, Repulsion, now that I've grown accustomed to this type of grindcore. 

Also try Retaliation, a band which I rarely hear people talk about. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBfkssbhfhk

More brutal vocals and sound than Nasum."
"Riff-oriented grindcore","Rotten Sound. Try the Species at War EP. Agoraphobic Nosebleed too, although they're kind of silly."
"Riff-oriented grindcore","Agorapocalypse is one of the greatest albums I have listened too. I can't wait to hear the four albums they are supposedly releasing this year. 


Rotten Sound is pretty great too, but I like Keijo Niinimaa's other band Medeia better. "
"Riff-oriented grindcore","Gadget has a kick ass album with some sick guitars"

"Riff-oriented grindcore","[Aftersundown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWrGnaGQqCQ) is exactly what you're looking for, despite their crappy name. [Captain Cleanoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdkp7boBpdM) will also provide some sexy riffs. These bands are very well known but in case you haven't heard them before, [Ghoul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBPTeusjsWs) and [Terrorizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjviWgLQLe4) are rifftastic as fuck."
"Riff-oriented grindcore","Along with Captain Cleanoff, I really dig the Australian grind scene. Blood Duster, Agents of Abhorrence, Fuck...I'm Dead. Just class."
"Riff-oriented grindcore","Ah I really liked that after sundown stuff"
"Riff-oriented grindcore","Maybe check out Cock and Ball Torture. Very groovy pornogrind band.

"Riff-oriented grindcore","Maybe power violence will have more of that melodic feel you're looking for. I think the biggest appeal of grindcore for some folks is the purposeful neglect of riffage."
"Riff-oriented grindcore","I'm really not looking for anything super melodic, I guess I'm more talking about the rhythm structure. Im looking something more influenced by punk than metal I think. Id like really heavy riffs with fast hardcore punk rhythm. Grindcore is just so mixed up and sporadic."
"Riff-oriented grindcore","check out Mind Eraser. 
Weekend Nachos. 
maybe ceremony? 
both heavy as fuck. "

"Riff-oriented grindcore","Cripple Bastards-Variante Alla Morte
Magrudergrind-S/T
Nails-Abandon All Life
Wormrot-Dirge
Excruciating Terror-Divided We Fall
This is all very dense, overwhelming stuff but there are some very good riffs. I was on a similar search for my perfect blast/groove ratio and I've found it in these records. The Cripple Bastards and Magrudergrind albums have particularly amazing riffage. Obviously, Napalm Death will be thrown around alot in this thread but their latest album Utilitarian was their best work since the 2005 'comeback' in my opinion, featuring some epic, earworm-hazard riffs."

"GRAF ORLOCK has done it again ladies and gents.",""
"GRAF ORLOCK has done it again ladies and gents.","The opening monologue is fucking sick. What's it from?"
"GRAF ORLOCK has done it again ladies and gents.","“Jason Schmidt” and “Alan Hunter” were working on a screenplay while attending UCLA called Destination Time Yesterday which created controversy in the school for not referencing sources. The controversy erupted to a riot involving the Los Angeles Police Department.

After the riot, “Jason” and “Alan” were expelled from UCLA. Both “Jason” and “Alan” along with bassist “Sven Calhoun” and vocalist “Kalvin Kristoff” begun Graf Orlock with EPs and split albums. In 2006, they started a trilogy based around the controversial screenplay starting with Destination Time Yesterday, and in 2007 Destination Time Tomorrow EP was released; which was number 16 in Decibel magazine’s Top 40 of 2007. The final chapter of the trilogy, Destination Time Today, was released in 2009.


I am assuming it was taken from their screenplay as it relates to the trilogy of Destination Time albums they have released previously."
"GRAF ORLOCK has done it again ladies and gents.","That's pretty fucking awesome. Do you know if it's available for viewing anywhere?"
"GRAF ORLOCK has done it again ladies and gents.","I have been a loyal fan of any sort of material from them since 2002-2003.

As far as I know, there wasn't ever a ""release"" and I assume that considering all the controversy surrounding the project when they were in school; it very possibly might have never seen the light of day.

While I have heard rumors of possible scenes, I can't find any concrete evidence leading to that specific screenplay. I would love to view/hear anything relating to it, but I am afraid their solution to the denial of the screenplay was releasing the trilogy of madness that is the Destination series in their current discography."

"Top 20 Grindcore Albums Of All-Time","I actually really liked that they chose Utopia Banished. To me that is an underrated classic of ND just playing the most blistering grind they could with their new drummer.

Speaking of which, fuck that venue Kingdom for not opening the doors for a few hundred people waiting outside until 2 minutes before Speedwolf started playing. I finally made it to a show they were playing, and I didn't make it inside in time to see them. Fucking assholes. "
"Met my favorite bassist the other night.","I saw them in Birmingham, AL. Speedwolf ruled, Exhumed ruled, Napalm Death ruled, Municipal Waste ruled. Only thing that sucked was the venue. It's a regular venue in Birmingham and the security is just ridiculous. Kids get thrown out instantly for jumping on top of people or even making an attempt to stagedive. No warnings or anything, they just damn throw them out of the show."
"Met my favorite bassist the other night.","All around a pretty good touring package, but I can't get into Municipal Waste anymore. I wasn't even planning on staying, but Napalm + a lot of whiskey and beer got me in the pit, so I was still kinda riled up. So I stuck around, for the whole set even. But I couldn't get into it, man. Maybe it's from being in Richmond, maybe it's bias from being exposed to some of those dudes too much outside of shows they're playing...but I just thought it was extremely boring. 

Regardless of that, Municipal Waste definitely should not have been headlining over Napalm. That's fucking retarded. "

What I think absolutely blows away all of itn is Barney going in, using his influence to make someone see some logic. I love that he talks the talk and walks the walk, the guy is fuckin awesome. I just don't see people that talk all this shit and back it up (especially in showbiz/music). I've done quite a bit of time behind walls (15yrs) and the thought of anyone coming to help would've been awesome. He's doing something that is a courageous fight, saving the lives of some people that have done nothing more than take a substance across a line. Death! I think not, if it's multiple murder or rapes. Maybe, but how many of these people got good lawyers, cops etc... I just think Barney has earned a big shout out and a humanitarian award or something. If any of you get a chance ever, you should definitely say something to this man and appreciate the fuckin guy for being a pioneer, a political voice for the disenfranchised and now for being a good man in trying to save some lives that I think we would agree don't need to be ended. "

"What do you like about Grindcore?","I have a friend who is very passionate about Metal. He loves Progressive Metal, Alternative Metal, some Black Metal, and Melodic Metal. 

He despises Grindcore, though. He's a classically trained singer and a Guitarist/Singer in a Prog Metal band, and he says that Grindcore is just noisy garbage that is objectively bad music. 

I was defending the genre (even though I'm not a fan myself), saying that just because he doesn't understand how people could like it doesn't mean it's just factually bad music. I couldn't myself describe what's tasteful about the genre, though. This is why I'm asking this question: What is it about Grindcore you like? 

I mainly listen to electronic music myself. Ambient, Bass Music, Trip Hop, Drum and Bass. The only music I consider even close to Grindcore I listen to is some of the tamer Breakcore stuff. (Which if you've never heard of it, listen to this [monstrous banger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccV54B9V5HM) right here)

What other genres do you guys like? "
"What do you like about Grindcore?","For me, it's the energy that draws me to Grindcore. Death metal, thrash metal and other genres seem to drift towards the explosive energy that I love so much, but Grindcore is the genre that uses it as its backbone. People might complain about the short album lengths or the unintelligible lyrics, but for me, they are completely necessary for the 'punch to the face' feeling that Grindcore is coated in.

As for prog metal that your friend is into, what would he say to the charge that it is nothing but masturbation over how 'talented,' 'complex,' or 'deep' it is? At least Grindcore doesn't pretend to be something it's not."
"What do you like about Grindcore?","He's a guitar player himself and he used prog metal as a way to challenge himself in his guitar playing. He wanted to take his skills to the extreme, and he does that by focusing on complex rhythmic structures. He likes it because it's fun to him. 

He likes the more melodic stuff nowadays, though. I think what he likes most about metal is not the complexity, but the versatility. Metal leaves room for so many different styles. "
"What do you like about Grindcore?","Blast beats"
"What do you like about Grindcore?","[deleted]"
"What do you like about Grindcore?","I like the intensity, the pure, full-blown explosion of energy. I use intense music to help me calm down. Laying on my bed and listening to something like Agoraphobic Nosebleed just draws all the tension and anger and frustration right out of me. It's totally cathartic and relaxing. Most people don't understand that, or how I go to sleep every night listening to death metal and techno, but it works for me.

I also think deep guttural growls sound fucking rad. Again, it's kind of a power/energy thing. Shouts and shrieks are ok too, but the growls and roars are my favorite. I like how grind doesn't ever get boring, it's always changing things up whether it be short songs or changing up the rhythm and riffs within a song. It's always moving forward, never sticking in the same spot too long.

As for other music I like, I mostly go for fast, heavy, high-energy music. I like all sorts of Punk, Hardcore, and Metal, and listen to a lot of electronic music too, like Trance, Dubstep, DnB, and Gabber. I've recently been branching out and getting into hip-hop too."
"What do you like about Grindcore?","Backed. The intensity of grindcore is the best thing about it, short and to the point. You know that moment when you're listening to some awesome grind and there's a riff or a beat that just grabs you by the testicles and forces you to move? That's what it's all about."
"What do you like about Grindcore?","Your friend sounds like a real life internet metal nerd.

I like grind core because it takes my overall favorite genre (hardcore punk) and, along with power-violence, takes it to whole new extremes. "
"What do you like about Grindcore?","Sorry that everyone's being a dickbutt, OP. 

For me, it's this idea of a big middle finger to music theory. Combine that with the fiery passion of grind and it just gives me shivers. "
"What do you like about Grindcore?","As most people have said, it is the energy that really compels me to grind. No other genre, for me personally, can convey just such pure energy and honestly sometimes it isn't even anger, it can be happiness, sadness or even fear that grind captures for me. Not necessarily in the music itself but in the urgency, speed and aggressiveness in the music can be translated to any of those feelings for me. As well, I also find that amongst the chaos, there are many catchy grooves and it is fun to listen to a song or album over and over to fully dissect it. I find that grind has the best tones of any genre. There is nothing better than the sound of a nice crunchy guitar that makes me curl my face up in respect for how filthy it sounds. Same with the vocals, the unique tones that are produced often impress me. Also, finally, the attitude is also an important aspect of grind to me. It is as someone else in the thread said, a big middle finger to ""traditional"" ideas about what constitutes ""good"" music. Using your friend as an example, people who think music should be a certain way and that other music is ""objectively"" bad is a complete falsity to what the true spirit of music is, I believe. Which should be more about capturing attitudes or feelings rather than playing as a technical exercise. 
As for other genres, I really like hip-hop, electro/synth pop, and other kinds of extreme music like hardcore, crust punk, crossover, etc."
"What do you like about Grindcore?","There's a certain rage I get in my bones when I listen to grindcore, hardcore punk and sometimes death metal that I can't get from anywhere else. Usually it takes a few minutes after I stop listening to shake it.

Love that shit"
"What do you like about Grindcore?","Grindcore doesn't string me along and bullshit me with unnecessary solos and wankery like some metal sub-genres. It's concise, fast, and straight to the point. Also, since the majority of grindcore songs are short, I feel like the composition and lyrics need to be fine tuned to fit the length of the song, making it seem more like poetry than anything... dark, sadistic, deafening poetry."

"What do you like about Grindcore?","the rhythm

metal music to me is about movement like dance music, actually i consider it dance music and the dance is usually the mosh. i think music can be physically sensed (rhythm, tempo and beat) and emotionally sensed (melody, lyrics, arrangement)

i dont really like super clinical technical bands because they are a little staccato and lack a groove or rhythm. i like technical music though so i will listen to brutal death metal for something i can mosh and also admire the playing.

grindcore is 90% physical music. it is obviously loud aggressive and obnoxious, songs are short fast and slammy, grindcore makes me feel like im rebellious and rejecting normal things and being violent. so of im in that mood i might listen to some.

grindcore also seems to throw out many musical preconceptions which is also very interesting. sure grindcore is clearly defined by a handful of definite things but i like how it is also unhinged and noisey and unmusical.

grindcore has its time and place like any genre, punk metal or anything else- and although i was quite heavily into it for a while i do not really listen to it these days. "
"What do you like about Grindcore?","I really appreciate all the well thought out responses, guys. Thanks."
"What do you like about Grindcore?","NO FUCKING ABOUT

And by that I mean the songs say what they need to say in as little time as possible.
If you like the middle but you gotta listen again.

It's also very pure, when I hear an album I like it can hit you like very few other genres can.

Also it's incredibly fun to play on drums.


As for other music, mostly metal and punk, but I also like a bit of hip hop and electronic music.
"
"What do you like about Grindcore?","It's cathartic. "
"What do you like about Grindcore?","The energy blasts you get from listening and playing grindcore are the main reasons I love grind. I'm a guitarist myself and decided to start a grindcore band even though I play technical stuff when I'm alone. I just figured I'd rather spin n' jump around playing ""easier"" stuff than ""perform"" and stand still.  I love grindcore gigs and the intensity of them and the local grindcore scene here is fantastic. Grindcore lets you scream your lungs out in public without opening your own mouth."
"What do you like about Grindcore?","Grindcore is the logical end to how fast/loud/unstructured music (well, guitar-based rock music, anyway) could become. Lyrically, it's a step away from the conventions of rhyming schemes and drawn-out word salads. When it's done well (think Napalm Death, Carcass, Heresy, or Repulsion), it sounds like hardcore punk rock filtered through a jet engine, and you get this urge to just **rage**."
"What do you like about Grindcore?","I started to type a huge reply, but it's fucking grindcore. It's just god damn intense, and that's all you really need to get. As for your friend, saying that a well established genre of music isn't music and is objectively bad is ignorant and just straight up stupid. He needs to get his head out of his ass about that. I can respect that you understand that even though you don't get it doesn't mean that it is bad."

Napalm Death - FETO   
Exulceration - split with Putrid Offal   
Regurgitate - Effortless regurgitation of bright red blood   
Terrorizer - World downfall

"What's your favourite grindcore album?","Excruciating Terror - Divided We Fall

I come across more people who prefer Expression of Pain over this one, but while the production is so savage on Expression, I just think ExTx did more interesting things with their riffs throughout the songs on Divided We Fall.  Besides, some of the guitar slides still sound like a revving motor, so it's a far cry from some Nasum rip-off in the production department."
"What's your favourite grindcore album?","As far as newer stuff definitely World Extermination, but any old school napalm death is also the shit "

"What's your favourite grindcore album?","okay, so the Nails and Dead in the Dirt thing never made total sense to me (i've always felt they were more ""crust-y"" punk/blackened hardcore with occasional blast beats), but pg.99? really?"
"What's your favourite grindcore album?","I think old screamo like pg99 or orchid shares a lot of similarities with grindcore. Obviously, it's not a heavy, but I think the visceral chaotic song structure is very reminiscent of grindcore. So maybe it's not actual grindcore, but I think it's grindy enough that it deserves a mention. I mean they did splits with Pig Destroyer and other grindcore bands so it's not like they were in a completely different scene or anything."
"What's your favourite grindcore album?","I mean don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan of all three bands I previously mentioned, and I feel they share some similarities with grindcore at times in certain songs musically, but I don't feel that they're aesthetically or ""spiritually"" what grindcore represents. I don't know, does that make any sense at all? Hahaha. "
"What's your favourite grindcore album?","yea, i totally get what you mean in that aspect. and you are right about that. I was thinking more musically when I made that post."
"What's your favourite grindcore album?","I'm still new to the genre, and labeling bands into neatly fitting packages kind of sucks to begin with but what would you consider bands like Daughters, Ed Gein, and The Number 12 Looks Like You?"

"Grindcore fans - do you enjoy powerviolence/hardcore punk?","Just curious. Personally, I had a massive prejudice against hardcore punk, having gotten into metal via death metal, but once I started delving into grindcore, I started to appreciate the HC/PV side of extreme music. Today, I'd say I enjoy both grindcore and powerviolence equally. How about you all - any feelings either way?"
"Grindcore fans - do you enjoy powerviolence/hardcore punk?","Yea"
"Animalistic Noisecore Frenzy"," Except not just monotonous max-aggression, something that sounds really uniquely unhinged and inhuman. Creative guitar composition with a strong noise influence would be nice. I suppose I seek something somewhere between Napalm Death's Peel Session and Discordance Axis. I feel like nothing really parallels the wildness of that Peel Session, but I crave less samey guitar work. It would be cool if the guitarists from Sonic Youth had a grind project."

"Animalistic Noisecore Frenzy","The last thing you wrote sounds too much like what I'm doing at the moment: I've told my bandmate that I want something that sounds like ""Mildred Pierce"" with blastbeats.  Get out of my head! (It's turning out more like Gerogerigegege meets Slowdive anyway.)  
  
These are the two closest things that I can come up with for active abstract grind projects at the moment:  
[AKBK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7VqzyaG2VA)  
[Brutal Blues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spHT6n0Uxkg)  
[Sissy Spacek](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pRaOtnKn3w) - not my thing but maybe you should try it out  

These aren't really like what you were necessarily looking for, but I'm in the same boat as you.  I couldn't think of any relevant noisecore to post at the moment but I don't know if that's really what you want in the first place."
"Animalistic Noisecore Frenzy"," I would like to hear this band if it ever develops into something, I'm trying to imagine what Gerigerogegege meets Slowdive would sound like and it's cracking me up. I have never heard them mentioned by the same person, ever. AKBK are fucking thrilling, I find their album really boring compared to their live show though unfortunately. More grindcore bands should do raw, spontaneous live-in-studio sessions with good, basic recording. I wish John Peel was still around."

"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?"," I've been on an extreme metal binge as of late after several years of avoiding the genre altogether. By far, I'm most drawn to bands in the vein of Napalm Death's post-2005 releases. In my opinion, they've been rising to the peak of their career in the last few years, but I think that's likely because I value precision, a certain degree of musicality and compositional inventiveness (as opposed to just blasting and pure sonic terror, which I respect but can't really dig) as well as thick, clear recordings. I've enjoyed alot of bands, but current Napalm Death and Pig Destroyer are the two big ones by far. I like when chaos and blastbeats spontaneously transform into amazing, headbanging grooves and back again and so on. EDIT: I should also mention that I understand ND's recent output isn't strictly grindcore. So I guess I don't like purist grindcore a whole lot. Also I FUCKING LOVE Barney Greenway and Scott Hull's vocals, and very very few metal vocalists appeal to me like that. It's so real and primal. J.R. HAYES YOU SIMPLETON. Scott Hull is great too though, he can really economize."

"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","Insect Warfare? 

Insect Warfare. "
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","If you love Scott Hull, be sure to check out Agoraphobic Nosebleed if you haven't. Especially the later albums. "
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","yo scott hull doesnt sing on pig destroyer its j.r hayes"
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?"," Man I knew that. I've been sleep-deprived lately and I keep doing weird dissassociative things like that."
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","You'll probably like Hatred Surge. The song Dark Circles is so new napalm death. Mumakil does that shit sometimes but they tend to stay blasting longed than grooving. Insect Warfare was like that too but on meth."
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","Hatred Surge was the only band I hadn't heard of yet, so I just checked them out. These guys are pretty bad ass. Might have to get an album or two later. "
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","Do it. They rule."
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","Post-altered state Agoraphobic Nosebleed is a lot like that, too. Agorapocalypse is a pretty perfect combo of drum machine insanity and heavy ass riffing"
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","I think my favorite is their And On And On split with Despise You so far, but Agorapocalypse is probably my second favorite. "
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","The split with kill the client is my favorite seven inch of all time. Im also a huge fan of their two Christmas flexi's"
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","You should prolly listen to more Cattle Decapitation. They're a bit more death metal than ND but their latest album Monolith of Inhumanity might have what you're looking for."
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","Definitely try the french band Blockheads, especially from Human Parade to their last album. Exactly what you're after. But you should try french grindcore bands really, that's the most popular style of grindcore over here (later Inhumate, Infest, Untamed, Massive Charge... lots of bands in that style)   
ND came to play their particular current style after hearing Nasum in the early 2000's. You could go with Nasum, they're the one to credit for bringing more precision in grindcore. Rotten Sound is pretty close too (though I personally don't like them much, I'm really more of a purist)   
Brutal Truth starting with Need To Control too, they're one of the bands that made the genre progress.    
If you're into more experimental stuff, I'd suggest you to try Discordance Axis as well. Intricate stuff with very original guitar work."
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?"," Thanks, I will check these things out! Have Napalm Death actually stated their current sound to be influenced by Nasum, or is it just easy to tell? I'll have to hear when I'm not deep in some Burzum. I'm quite excited that a band is exactly what I'm after! I really get how the pure grindcore of the 90's would excite people enough for it to become such a trend, but I think it will inevitably move in this direction if it's to endure as a genre. Not necessarily pop or even rock sensibility, but people thinking about it more as composition than just cut-and-paste. That's how you delivereth the best brutality. Intricacy and original guitar work appeals to me, as I'm getting just a little tired of the standard tonality range in death metal-hardcore-rooted stuff."
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","They have explicitely stated it yes, maybe not in those exact terms but they did say that it was Nasum that made them play grindcore(-influenced) stuff again (they brifely switched to something more industrial sounding in the late 90's). To me it's quite easy to tell, although I'll always enjoy the dirtier side of Napalm Death compared to Nasum.   
ANd grindcore has always been about composition, and songwriting, as simple as it can be. Napalm Death is an excellent example. From Enslavement To Obliteration is a masterpiece of songwriting, for example. It's just very different of the current ""brutal"" labeled stuff.   
On a completely different note, I'd suggest you try the early albums of Canadian band Neuraxis. They remind me quite a lot of the later Napalm Death when they go brutal ; but they have the melodic sensibility of the current wave of technical/melodic bands. I'd sum them up as a good blend of modern grindcore and melodic death metal. As much as I am a purist when it comes to grindcore/metal or whatever, I love those guys. Check their album Truth Beyond."
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?"," From Enslavement to Obliteration seems like great work to me, the production just kills it for me. I need to get that EQ right to appreciate the composition. It's probably just a fidelity thing with early grindcore, as even with great clarity I have to focus to grasp the structure."
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","That's part of the point of the music, really, more than it is a production thing. Density is an integral part of grindcore and it takes time to get used to it (took me several years haha, but fascination kept me going and it's now my favourite genre ever). That's part of the reason I always recommend Napalm Death for grindcore beginners, it retains the grindcore elements while being clearer than the typical band.   
Try the Peel Sessions from Napalm Death, it's probably their best works, and being engineered/mastered by the almighty BBC... it's also their best sounding. The pure violence and chaos might get you off at first but honestly this is a monumental piece."
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?"," I do quite like the density, at first it was my least favorite aspect but now I'm really into the sections of pure violence and chaos. I like just allowing the blast sections to pulverize my consciousness and immerse me in violence, and then the greatest thing is when it breaks from that directly into an epically groovy, headbanging riff and I must go nuts. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGVlp_GqiNU This track is the perfect example. I don't mind rough recording, I just like it to thud. And it just bothers me when I have no idea whatsoever what the guitars are doing. PS, Blockheads are FUCKING AMAZING. This is my shit."
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","Oh yes, and on the topic of french grindcore, go try Warfuck. An insane power duo from my hometown who have absolutely everything you're after."
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?"," Sheeeeeit. This is a duo? It's awesome. Really original despite having that ever-present grindcore vibe."
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","[Maruta](http://youtu.be/gsneC9Q6gqs) is worth checking out for sure."
"I'm obsessed with latter-era Napalm Death. Throw me some bands/releases?","PD and ND are my favorite grindcore/deathgrind bands as well. Other I like are Nails, Magrudergrind, Insect Warfare and Wormrot, so you might want to check them out."

"Sasquatch Agnostic - Complete Mammalography [2010]","This is the entire discography of grindcore band SASQUATCH AGNOSTIC -- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ThMOKV3m08

The COMPLETE MAMMALOGRAPHY features 41 tracks &amp; 3 albums -- 'THUNDER OF THE YETI' (2007) 'GRINDHARMAGEDDON' (2008) &amp; 'IN THE CATACOMBS OF CHARENTON' (2007). This band is the brainchild of underground USA journalist Ryan Bartek, best known for his books 'THE BIG SHINY PRISON (Volume One)' , FORTRESS EUROPE (The Big Shiny Prison Vol. II)' , and 'The Silent Burning.' 

SASQUATCH AGNOSTIC was created to make a screaming, raging nightmare of grindcore -- like the sort of thing you'd get in a tape trade in the 90's and scratch your head saying ""what the fuck is this noise?"" The lyrics balance between political satire and comedic absurdity in the vein of Naked Lunch, with heavy emphasis on anarchist perception and Orwellian outbursts. Former AKA MABUS guitarist Ryan Bartek plays all instruments in SASQUATCH AGNOSTIC except the drums, and does most the vocals under the alias 'Benedict Badoglio.

"Beginner Grindcore Recommendations?","I've always had a lot of friends that were into grindcore, but never managed to get into it myself. I'm no stranger to extreme music, and in fact love black metal and 90's hardcore. I also like a lot of the lyrical themes present in the grindcore that I've heard, especially environmentalism and anti-corporatism.


Other than local bands and a 7"" comp called Thrash Ahoy, I haven't been exposed much to grindcore. 
I guess what I'm looking for is the most entry-level pleb shit to help me understand what is good about grind and how to judge what makes good grindcore. 


I'm not as much looking for historically important releases (I can find that shit on Wikipedia), but instead prime examples of what defines the great aspects of the genre.
Thanks in advance for your help.

"I really like Toxic Narcotic and Brujeria. What kind of grindcore bands would you suggest for me?","There's just something about those two bands that kills it. It just seems like they're more melodic about it than just making noise. Maybe it's the songs I've heard, but I never got into Napalm Death. Any suggestions about anything? "
"I really like Toxic Narcotic and Brujeria. What kind of grindcore bands would you suggest for me?","""melodic"" grindcore is kind of an oxymoron, but I can see what you mean...    
Not exactly in the same vein as Brujeria, but in the """"""melodic"""""" vein, Lock Up comes to mind. Preferably the live album, far better than the studio albums. Asesino is probably the closest thing you'll get to Brujeria (note that i don't like either of them.)    
Toxic Narcotic is more of a crust/hardcore outfit rather than a grindcore one, I'd suggest going with classic 80s hardcore/dbeat/crust... From what I hear on youtube they remind me a lot of Chaos UK for a reason (my personal favorite is the split with the equally awesome japanese band Deathside) and a bit like a speedier Aus-Rotten. Try some bands from their time-period, I think you can't wrong with anything from Poison Idea, or closer to grindcore, Siege.    
If you're really looking for pure grindcore though, I'd suggest you give another try to Napalm Death, and particularly the From Enslavement To Obliteration : this is the pure definition of grindcore. I'd add my all time favourite Agathocles with their Razor Sharp Daggers album for more of the same goodness, and it's closer to the crust/punk side of grindcore than the ND album. S.O.B. is also a good choice, particularly from Thrash Night to Gate Of Doom (the first records are awesome too but are more in a SIege-like hardcore vein I think).    
(and if you're ready for grind precursors : Repulsion.)"
"I really like Toxic Narcotic and Brujeria. What kind of grindcore bands would you suggest for me?","Oh yeah, about Napalm Death too : if FETO is too noisy for you, I suggest you give a try to their more recent albums, to me the best albums to start ND are Order Of The Leech and ""The Code Is Red... Long Live The Code"". They're good summaries of today's ND and excellents entries to modern, ""mainstream"" grind, but mostly to understand the genre.

"I really like Toxic Narcotic and Brujeria. What kind of grindcore bands would you suggest for me?","and maybe one more, musically not that related but lyrical themes and mood is, (and also that spanish-y thingy), Ratos de Porão"
"I really like Toxic Narcotic and Brujeria. What kind of grindcore bands would you suggest for me?","Not pure grindcore, but close in crusty atmosphere are Weekend Nachos and Nails, if you want something dirty and grindy go Brutal Truth (not the last album though IMO), Insect Warfare, Swarrrm and their japanese fellows 324. Also Venomous Concept for cool crusty grinding. For something darker, you can't go wrong with Dephosphorus. And for something groovy, Homo Iratus..

"I really like Toxic Narcotic and Brujeria. What kind of grindcore bands would you suggest for me?","I've absolutely never understood why Venomous Concept gets so often tagged as grindcore. I mean, sure the band members are almost all grindcore legends, but the music is 100 % Poison Idea worshipping (right up to the name). It's awesome hardcore punk and I love them, but it's definitely not grindcore.    
Recomending them is fitting, of course, but I hate seeing them tagged that way. It would be like saying Lock Up is a melodeath band because Tompa and Tätgren did vocals for them."

"Let's hear some 7-string grind bands","I don't know why people are saying no. Scott Hull uses a 7 string in Pig Destroyer and Agoraphobic Nosebleed .

Djent gave 7 strings such a bad name."
"Let's hear some 7-string grind bands","There's plenty of non djent metal bands with 7 strings."
"Let's hear some 7-string grind bands","Exactly!"
"Let's hear some 7-string grind bands","yes! I just posted here because there really aren't many Grindcore bands that I know of that use 7 strings and I'm looking to expand my horizons a little. Fuck Djent, I just wanna hear some grind that has a little extra low end punch. Check out [Mother Brain](http://motherbrain666.bandcamp.com/) they're a 2 piece 7 string band and they fuckin' slay! Or don't, incase you're frightened by guitars with too many strings for some reason."
"Let's hear some 7-string grind bands","Just showed this comment/thread to my good friend who is the singer/guitarist of Mother Brain. He has no idea what reddit even is but he appreciates the sentiment haha."
"Let's hear some 7-string grind bands","I love Mother Brain's ep2.  I didn't even know they played a seven string.
"
"Let's hear some 7-string grind bands","Well, maybe because Pig Destroyer and AnB aren't grindcore bands."
"Let's hear some 7-string grind bands","What? How are they not? The farthest Pig Destroyer would go would be Death Grind which I would still consider Grindcore.  Agoraphobic Nosebleed is totally a grindcore band too unless you think that having a drum machine makes you a cybergrind band in which case they are still grindcore. It's like if you are a thrash metal band you are still a metal band. They both have metal and hardcore influence, brutal speed, blast beats, and destructive vocals.  Even if you think that both of those bands aren't Mother Brain which was mentioned above is totally a straight Grindcore band."
"Let's hear some 7-string grind bands","Honestly, they're both too metal and don't have enough blasts for me to consider them grind."

"CHUD - A Maniac Called Frank Zito",""
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","I think these guys are one of the best live grind bands I've seen from the UK. They capture all the genre's aggression and insanity in perfect imbalance. Can't wait for new recordings :

http://atomck.bandcamp.com/album/never-work"
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","Assuck. No one knows about them, which is a crime. "
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","Is this meant to be a joke? I'm actually wondering, not trying to be a jerk.  Where I'm from, I feel like everyone with a passing interest in grindcore knows Assuck."
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","I don't know a single person in my circle of metal-friends who knows who Assuck is. Napalm, sure. Repulsion, of course. But no Assuck."
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","same with me except the people I know who know Assuck are borderline homeless/alcoholic crusties. "
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","Fucking hell yes Assück. Great band. "
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","As strange as it may seem, Agathocles. People are usually quick to dismiss them, solely based on their number of records. Their genuine musical qualities are often overlooked (seriously, Razor Sharp Daggers and Black Clouds Determinate are pure gold. On par with FETO.)   
Mesrine feels a bit underrated too. THey often pass for a sub-par Dahmer, for a number of reasons (both are serial-killer themed grindcore bands from Quebec...), but they musically they're quite far from each other. Dahmer almost has a gory feel at times, and can be quite intense, in an Assück fashion... Mesrine is far more d-beat oriented, and has an instantly recognizable sound (the guitar sound, mostly). Personally, I love them both equally.   
Retaliation is perhaps the most cruelly forgotten band IMO. Their first releases are absolute gems of old school goregrind, the kind that Regurgitate would play after them, and their subsequent grindcore stuff is pure, hateful golden stuff. I seriously recommend everyone in this sub to get the discography album and the Cost Of Redemption. Some of my favourite stuff ever is on those records.   
Birdflesh is often overlooked too because of their silly imagery, but I can't think of a better swedish band currently.   
Don't get me started on the whole australian scene also haha, Australia (and Canada) currently have the best grindcore/goregrind output in the world."
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","Agathocles wrote a ton of stuff. Some was a little lacking, but they had a ton of excellent material. They were one of my favorites. "
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","[deleted]"
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","Probably one of my favourites too. There's just too much good stuff from them."
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","For me, Mesrine definitely has become way too death metal over the past however many years. They used to do that whole heavy d-beat grind which was sweet, but I think it was around Obsessive Compulsive where they started to change."
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","I agree. They still get too much shit for being close to Dahmer though. I admit I didn't like their latest output. Less fun."
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","Gride from the Czech Republic.
Lymphatic Phlegm from Brazil.
The Kill from Australia.
"
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","Lymphatic Phlegm is some of the strangest goregrind around, but I agree with you they're underrated. "
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","Upvote for Gride, love those Czech bastards. Saw them live at MDF2010 and they did not disappoint!"
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","Pizza hi five, lt.dan, shit life, exogorth, malpractice insurance, agitate."

"Most underrated grindcore bands?","Internal rot is disgustingly good"
"Most underrated grindcore bands?","The great thing about grind is that it is made up of a world of small bands slogging away by themselves. There's always amazing stuff just waiting to be dug up.

"New Napalm Death Video - ""Smash a Single Digit"" (animated)","I can understand why a Napalm Death fan may not like the newer material. It is substantially different from the earlier stuff, and it doesn't have that raw spastic, crusty side.

That being said, I think one thing that helped me kind of bridge the gap between the newer material and the old is that songs like this are chaotic in a different way. The increased technicality (in my opinion) makes it possible for more variation, and a wider swath of song structue. In comparison to the straight blasting of records like 'Scum,'  songs like ""In Deference,"" ""Everyday Pox,"" and ""The Great and the Good"" throw in some major surprises, which is made possible with the newer style. I think there is more chaos, but more structure at the same time."

"""Grindcore is NOT metal""","I recently went to Obscene Extreme Fest in the Czech Republic and I heard this phrase quite a lot. It was something that got tossed around by a few of the festival goers and I would love to hear your opinion. "
"""Grindcore is NOT metal""","Grindcore isn't metal. It came out of the punk scene around the time metal was getting bigger and people were getting bored of the hardcore scene way back long before my time. Me and grindcore are almost the same age."
"""Grindcore is NOT metal""","Well, technically if it sounds more like metal it's ""deathgrind"" a la mid-era Carcass and such.  Old school grindcore has more in common with the hardcore punk scene and was always (in my opinion) a punk subgenre as opposed to a metal subgenre.  You can also see this punk influence in the heavily political lyrics/aspects of a lot of grind bands."
"""Grindcore is NOT metal""","Grindcore isn't metal. Like thrash (DRI, COC, Cryptic Slaughter) it's a hybrid of metal and punk. Thus it keeps its character; it is neither metal nor punk. Probably closer to the hardcore punk/crust side however."
"""Grindcore is NOT metal""","I completely agree with everything you guys say. Especially, to the untrained ear, it all sounds the same. "
"""Grindcore is NOT metal""","The untrained ear also can't tell death metal from a broken air conditioner."
"""Grindcore is NOT metal""","It's as metal as goth. Though gothic-metal is pretty common fusion, unlike grind-metal (if there is any), but it's taxonomically not metal unless fused.
Also while metalheads headbang and or try to look serious (especially black metalists), grind pit is more of a dance (with all the funny masks and stuff, as seen at OEF)
To casual observer there might be no difference in metal and grind, mostly due to common instrumentation, growls and heavy distortion, song structure is way more punk like, where are it's origins. 

(tip for further brainstorming: what would happen if there was metal subgenere that have evolved fromd death metal, sounding same as grind, making two styles with different histories but no way to distinguish them :3 )"

Any grind/powerviolence/anything similar bands that want to tell Fred Phelps to hurry up and die, and probably have the comp sent to his children, write a song lyrically matching the theme, and send it our way. Hoping to get 20 - 40 bands, so don't hesitate to join in the fun. We'll take anything grind, powerviolence, hardcore, thrash, doom, slam, sludge, even punk rock (although we might be a little picky with that last one).

Here's the Bandcamp. http://dickcrushrecords.bandcamp.com/ And the Facebook. https://www.facebook.com/DICKCRUSHRECORDS

Let us know on Fartbook or message me here if you want in. That old bastard's gonna kick the bucket soon, and I'd like to get a copy to Shirley while it's still fresh, so let's go go go!

EDIT: A lot of people have been asking about a deadline for song submission. Which is a reasonable question. The sooner the better obviously, but really, as long as I'm burning the cdr's by the end of May or something, I don't really care."

"Can you help me identify an album?","I saw this album cover about 4 years ago so my memory is slightly faded. I remember that it has a man in either a basement/garage, and he's waving to a neighbor across the street through his window. Yet inside the basement/garage we can see all chopped up people and heads and stuff.

I cannot remember the name at all, but something is telling me that it may have been an Italian band? If anyone could help that would be great, I remember the album cover as being ever so hilarious.

"Why did Repulsion only release one record if they are still active?","*Horrified* came out in 1989, and the band still plays live, so why haven't they written anything new? It puzzles me."
"Why did Repulsion only release one record if they are still active?","Because they already released the best grindcore album of all time, there's no need for a followup "
"Why did Repulsion only release one record if they are still active?","Although there is no denying the supremacy of 'Horrified' (I am proud to own an original Necropolis press), the live Repulsion shows need to stop. It's just embarrassing at this 'stage.' I understand it's a steady income influx for the folks involved, but there is something to be said for not massacring your reputation by flogging a rotten corpse. I would bet that the band have tried to write additional material (post 7""), but it just could not stand beside the original stuff. To their credit, few could ever replicate the feel of such incredible grindcore, even today,  including the same damn band. Cretin do a fine job, but nothing will ever match the original. "
"Why did Repulsion only release one record if they are still active?","I kind of agree about the live shows but I saw them at MDF 2010 and I thought they were great, although I bet they are better inside.  I don't think they play that often live so I am ok with it.    "
"Why did Repulsion only release one record if they are still active?","Not sure which line up you saw but I caught a live set of theirs recently in Portland with the original singer and they were spot fucking on. One of the best sounding live sets I'd seen in a while. They had the drummer of LA black metal band Exausted Prayer on drums.  "
"Why did Repulsion only release one record if they are still active?","Its kind of the same thing as Bolt Thrower (although they released a lot more albums than Repulsion).  They felt they couldn't release anything that held up so they haven't but still do live shows.  

Also if your looking for current Repulsion type bands....check out Modorra - Solar Anus.  Holy shit that album rips"
"Why did Repulsion only release one record if they are still active?","I believe they broke up for personal reasons after that album, some members had family commitments, and I believe another joined the military. They re-formed semi-recently, I think. 
I may be wrong, I only discovered the band recently. "

"Why do (some) grind songs have so poetic lyrics","when no one can understand what is being singed unless he reads the lyrics from somewhere? 

All outsiders can't even tell the difference between vowels and consonants in a song, all vocals sound like a consistent noise. "
"Why do (some) grind songs have so poetic lyrics","because why not. no rules."
"Why do (some) grind songs have so poetic lyrics","Shorter songs and less of an adherence to verse/chorus/verse structure

I also like the incomprehensibility - you get some really nice poetry if you read the lyrics, but only if you read them.

It also helps contrast with the music: Bone Awl is chaotic, angry grind/black metal, but they have really poetic and poignant lyrics."
"Why do (some) grind songs have so poetic lyrics","When Napalm Death had recorded the SCUM album they had already recorded guitars/drums before Lee Dorian joined. During recording of his vocals they had to give him signs at the parts when he had to do his growls. Not to mention that all lyrics were probably written post-recording. IMO this turned out great! On the contrary it's a little bit awkward if you can follow the lyrics on Nasum or Phobia songs. But anyway, if that's turning you off grindcore then it's maybe the wrong music genre for you!? Or just get used to it! So much fun! In the end: what it's all about is that the vocals are just another instrument/wall of noise."

I have seen Wormrot in Gainesville, Orlando, and Miami, and just for kicks other grind bands I've seen down here include Phobia, Napalm Death, Torch Runner, Devalued, No Qualms, Ironside, Swamp Gas, Shitstorm, Magrudergrind, Iron Lung, Bastard Noise and many many others. It is just a matter of getting involved in your local scene and staying informed.  "
"Wormrot - Compulsive Disposition (Singapore grindcore!)","Seriously? Aside from an occasional appearance in Atlanta by a bigger band, I never hear about grind bands coming through the coastal area of GA; the people who book shows around here are only interested in pop-punk and hot-topic, breakdown ridden hardcore. I think it may just be Georgia, or that I don't really know anyone else in the area that listens to grind. but I never hear about shows like those. "
"Wormrot - Compulsive Disposition (Singapore grindcore!)","Maybe Florida just has a really good scene, but all the people involved around here are really awesome and are supportive of music. Look up 305 Fest and come down for next years. Its not straight grind, but it is a pile of fun."
"Wormrot - Compulsive Disposition (Singapore grindcore!)","From what I hear from my buddies, Florida has a pretty decent scene. I just looked it up and it definitely sounds like something I'd dig; we don't do anything like that in southeastern GA.

"I could use some help finding a band that hasn't existed for quite some time","This was a three person band, they were some really obnoxious grindcore group and I can't remember their name at all. I believe they disbanded before I even knew about them something like 5-6 years ago, and the only thing I remember about them is that in one of their videos the lead singer is wearing shortshorts, a white t-shirt, and a headband. They also have a song that has an audio clip about a minute or two in about someone's last words being put on their headstone, because they were definitely going to die.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

"how to do the grindcore vocal styles?","I'm looking into becoming a vocalist for grindcore but I have no vocal knowledge what's so ever all I have played is guitar! I would like to do the styles that insect warfare has but I have no idea where to start? How could I go about this?"
"how to do the grindcore vocal styles?","Start learning death metal vocal styles. From there you'll learn where you're most. Comfortable and expand to. Start learning pig squeals,  grunts,  and more guttural brutal sounds that can adjust to your style of. Grind.  Just for the love of God please make sure you're doing it properly and not bursting you throat through your nose. 

Or you could inhale and say you're exhaling (illfindyouandkillyouifyoudothat) "
"how to do the grindcore vocal styles?","&gt;this
I've done grind vocals for about three years now, and I've never ever done them properly. I lack consistency for how they sounded, even though everyone seemed to really like them. I somehow haven't done any damage, but it could change, so yes, please learn. 

Also never inhale. Ever. Ever. "
"how to do the grindcore vocal styles?","Thing about grind core is the vocals blend well with the crazy insane instrumentals.  Where as death metal it a lot smoother than that and you pay a lot more attention to how the vocals sound. I've been doing death metal vocal for a few years and I've always practice consistency. Grind is. More preference I feel.  "
"how to do the grindcore vocal styles?","Yeah, death metal vocals are definitely much more prominent and scrutinized within their genre, so getting them perfect can be important. But for grind, it needs to speak to the atmosphere, so spastically screaming with no discernible consistency or method worked perfect for me. "
"how to do the grindcore vocal styles?","how would I go about learning those styles too if I may ask?"
"how to do the grindcore vocal styles?","Start practising with people that know how to do it Properly! I can't stress that enough.  Starting off is the hardest part your throat will hate you until you learn to use your diaphragm.  Breathing techniques are also super important. Controlling your breath for those long notes or strings.  It's not something you will pick up overnight.  YouTube tutorials can help but make sure you're using your diaphragm and not your throat for the millionth time "
"how to do the grindcore vocal styles?","thanks man!"
"how to do the grindcore vocal styles?","A few things to add to what others have said:

Warm up exercises. I don't care if you feel silly or think you will look like a dork, do it. It's like with singing. Yes, you are focusing on your diaphragm,but you are still technically pushing your voice in a way you're not used to, so warming up keeps the vocal cords lose. 

Trying to go for a certain style is great. Even if you have someone more in mind(which you said you did), that will work. Just keep in mind you're not them. Your talking voice is probably different from there's, as is your singing voice. Naturally, same will be your screams/growls.Try not to force a specific sound to much. It should come more naturally. Sure, experiment a little, but if you start pushing to sound just like them, you're probably gonna start using your throat a little more. 

Stay hydrated. It keep the vocal cord limber, and helps maintain the protective mucosal lining which coats the vocal folds and protects them from the natural friction that occurs during vocalization. Obviously, water helps. A lot. There are also some good fruits and veggies such as watermelon, cucumbers, celery, and strawberries. "
"how to do the grindcore vocal styles?","One thing too add, control your breathing. You can take a lot of air in, you don't have to let it out all at once. I found once I learned air and diaphragm control it started to come around. Always be wary of your throat, you can get nodes and they can turn cancerous, then you'll be whispering, believe me it's not worth it."
"how to do the grindcore vocal styles?","You kind of have to kind of experiment, but you don't use your vocal chords. You have to push your vox out with your diaphragm."
"how to do the grindcore vocal styles?","You can't be seriously asking for tuition on how to grunt like an animal?

What next? ""How do you breathe?"" ""How do you eat food?"""
"how to do the grindcore vocal styles?","Considering how it takes practice to sound right and not fuck up your throat, I can't blame him. "

"Artwork I did for a Shitnoise Bastards / Beer Terror release (NSFW - Language)","Looks awesome. Also, I've always wondered since I have absolutely no artistic skills but end a bunch of records, how does it work formatting it for a record? What do you usually originally draw it on and then how do you get it the right size? Do you end up using photoshop?"
"Artwork I did for a Shitnoise Bastards / Beer Terror release (NSFW - Language)","Hey ISuckCocks4Money, I draw it on white card with black ink then scan it in. Using photoshop at the moment but I don't do so much to be honest. I just crop out the unused card. The image there is actually scaled down as the logo's were really small and that was about as large as the logo's could get without going far too pixelated. Normally when an image is sent off to be printed as a record sleeve you will be asked to set the image on a template to get the right size."

I'm already worshipping Archagathus to a ridiculous point and well aware of bands like Rot, Lt. Dan, Unholy Grave or Rotocles (I love this band name). Mincing goregrind also counts. Thank you !"
"Mincecore and Agathocles-like recommendations","Try Pizza Hi Five, SMG, Camphora Monobromata, Maximum Thrash, Sakatat, Powercup, Matka Teresa"
"Mincecore and Agathocles-like recommendations","Also Violent Gorge if you're into Archagathus"
"Mincecore and Agathocles-like recommendations","Yeah, exactly what I was looking for !! Thanks."
"Mincecore and Agathocles-like recommendations","Forgot about [Misanthropic Noise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGXf9tmhjPA) too, one of my favorite mincecore bands."
"Mincecore and Agathocles-like recommendations","Total Hipster Crusher, Faction Disaster, Meatus haven't been mentioned here. And Arroyo. And Parazitózis."

"Mincecore and Agathocles-like recommendations","Thanks much for this one !!! Arroyo and  THC are awesome !!! (and Parazitozis is one my favourite new bands. I'm sharing a split with him in the near future. Really stoked.)"
"Mincecore and Agathocles-like recommendations","I still don't understand how ""mincecore"" is any different from grind and I've been listening to grindcore for 10 years. Care to elaborate? Probably know a few bands that fit the bill."
"Mincecore and Agathocles-like recommendations","Very simple song structures with two-three riffs, heavily distorted bass, a sharper (opposite to heavy) sound, and an emphasis on dbeat rhythms alongside the usual blastbeats. Something that sounds closer to the early bands of the UK scene; as opposed to Assück (for example) or the more modern take of Rotten Sound/Nasum.   
I agree it's a sub-subgenre, but it separates well a different style of grind that I enjoy more."

Use last FM if you like any of these, check out similar artists."
"Mincecore and Agathocles-like recommendations","Noisear is the complete opposite of Mince. Technical as fuck.  OP should just check out South East Asia, everything they make sounds like shit. "

"What do you consider to be *essential* modern grind bands?","Pig Destroyer and Agoraphobic Nosebleed are kinda bleh in my opinion, AN's drum machine bothers me. Also I wouldn't consider Napalm Death modern, though have have been continuously releasing material, their peak has passed. As for modern grind I'd say that Captain Cleanoff, Insect Warfare, Wormrot, Mass Grave, Swarrrm, and Noisear. "

"What do you consider to be *essential* modern grind bands?","Since they weren't mentioned; Assuck, Discordance Axis."
"What do you consider to be *essential* modern grind bands?","This is a vague question as far as some of these answers are suggesting.  Maybe you should specify on whether you mean modern on the grounds that the bands have existed within the last decade, or if you mean modern in an aesthetic sense like any Nasum-worship band or any DA ripoffs."
"What do you consider to be *essential* modern grind bands?","Splitter, Maruta, Insect Warfare, Syntax, Kill the Client, Slash Dimentia"
"What do you consider to be *essential* modern grind bands?","Wormrot is definitely mandatory. I can see how some people would dislike Agoraphobic Nosebleed's drums, but they're pretty boss.

"AKA MABUS - Lord Of The Black Sheep","This is the long lost AKA MABUS record LORD OF THE BLACK SHEEP (2006). AKA MABUS blended every form of metal &amp; punk together in a genre-defying blasting destroyer that is best described as ""grindpunk,"" because it has a different feel to it. Try to imagine a grind-blasting version of THE DWARVES and DK mixed with thrash/death metal sections and Frank Zappa humor. AKA MABUS burned fast &amp; hard from 2004-2006. LORD OF THE BLACK SHEEP was recorded in 2006 and unreleased until 2010. Help spread this obscure beast to grinders, metalheads &amp; punks across the globe! AKA MABUS was August Krueger (drums), General Robert Lee Simpson (Vocals/Samples) Ryan Bartek (guitar) &amp; Steve Bersche (Bass). All musicians insist you pirate this album!!!

REVIEW FROM METAL MANIACS MAGAZINE, MAY 2007: 'It's like sledding down a mountain of landmines, hauling ass like a champ to ensure you're past the next one when it blows, damn close to becoming pink snow each time. Blending grindcore, punk, industrial and thrash elements together, exposure to AKA MABUS incites an anarchic, uncontainable explosion of neurotic hate the punks, grinders, 'bangers and all chaos-born heathens into raw, demented, metallic battery will likely dig. And it bore no surprise upon first listen... A dude who expresses his inner rage towards modern humanity in any artistic way possible, 'Maniacs' writer/musician/pissed American Ryan Bartek helps man this act. I am sure others involved share and contribute to the bands message. End-bringing apocalyptic/anarcho, proto/retro, genre crossbreeding has resulted in something that's immediately familiar yet completely innovative. I need not add comparisons since it genre-jumps/mangles nonstop. Discerningly catchy, pathologically corrosive and (hopefully) morally corruptive, 'Lord Of The Black Sheep' is a f**king outstanding display of what America can produce musically, yet will remind you of its evils and contradictions in every syllable.' -Dave Brenner

"Daughters - Canada Songs [2003] (reposting from a year ago, for some new love)","Pretty certain it's actually the same vocalist. I think I remember hearing that Lex just decided that he didn't want to continue the screaming thing in Daughters. He wanted to find a way to make them stand out from the other bands in their scene, while preserving his voice for a longer career. (Screaming like that can completely ruin some people's vocal chords.)

You can hear the beginnings of his future vocal style used on parts of the tracks ""I Don't Give A Shit About Wood"" and ""The Ghost With The Most""."
"Daughters - Canada Songs [2003] (reposting from a year ago, for some new love)","I'm fairly certain it is a different vocalist. I watch live stuff and sometimes it's one guy, someone's is not. One live show I watched halfway through the set they changed vocalists. "
"Daughters - Canada Songs [2003] (reposting from a year ago, for some new love)","It's definitely the same guy, he just has long hair at some points and more recently shaved his head. 


For the set where they switched vocalists, I think you are referring to this show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbAkCdaIXT4
in which case he dislocated his shoulder so they had a vocalist from an opening band fill in to pass the mic around to the crowd.

&gt;Regarding our upcoming EP ""Amer""...

&gt;There will be no Kickstarter/Indiegogo campaign. Everything has been paid in full with money we made from touring and working jobs when we're not on tour. What we weren't able to afford we learned to do ourselves.

&gt;We make music because creating art brings a smile to our faces. We release this music because we are proud of what we did. If you don't buy our music, we will still continue to make it. If you don't go to our shows, we will still end up in a basement somewhere playing to whoever wants to be there.

2) Dat fucking snare. Ugh. I love when a snare cuts through everything else."
"As The Sun Sets - A Thousand Falling Skies [2:32]","for some reason I always thought the vocals sounded like the guy from Destroyer Destroyer, but never looked it up; it makes more sense that it's a bunch of dudes from Daughters."

"As The Sun Sets - A Thousand Falling Skies [2:32]","I checked them out the other day. Only stuff I could find on YouTube were very low quality live videos. Couldn't really hear much of it, but it sounded alright. I typically don't care for hardcore, but I'll give it a listen when they have an EP out.

"Organ Sludge - EBOLA EP",""
"Would someone be kind enough to explain powerviolence?","I'm new to /r/grindcore but not to the genre of music. My main exposure to Grind is through deathgrind bands such as Cattle Decap and Dying Fetus, so i'm not *completely* familiar with the pure genre and its related music. Would anyone be able to explain to me the exact distinction between powerviolence and grindcore? Also if anyone would like to recommend some good Grincore bands for me to check out beside Rotten Sound, Cephalic Carnage, and Dr. Acula that would also be killer.

TL;DR- What is powerviolence and what are some good grind bands? "
"Would someone be kind enough to explain powerviolence?","The [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_violence) is certainly enlightening, I'm learning right along with you about powerviolence. 

I can't extrapolate on PV more than that, but I can suggest a few of my favorite grindcore bands: 

* [Priapus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFhbdZ8vCFY) - intense bursts of violent deathgrind with emphasis on grind
* [Fuck the Facts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ15tYs97fA) - a bit progressive female-fronted grindcore
* [Plague Bringer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfBuWtYQJ7A) - cyber deathgrind (two members and a drum machine, [fucking love these guys](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Plague_Bringer/59590))
* [Genghis Tron](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqGU6YuBjOc) - progressive cybergrind? Electronic sounds, terrific stuff, that video is wacky
* [Margrudergrind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhOCUlMWA8M) - pretty big right now
* [Pig Destroyer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP3Xmc8JMGE) - the best grind band ever IMO
* [Leng Tch'e](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_aoY7FtTzI) - great quality stuff for fans of Cephalic Carnage
* [Call of the Void](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dv-YrIe7NY) - grindcore/sludge/hardcore/metal with emphasis on the grind
* [Agoraphobic Nosebleed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RslA81J2E0U) - unrelenting grindcore, Merry Chrystmeth!

"Would someone be kind enough to explain powerviolence?","I got my name from a [Fuck the Facts song!](https://soundcloud.com/discorage/03-fuck-the-facts-disco-rage) (song starts around 1:16) This is back when Topon did vocals. "
"Would someone be kind enough to explain powerviolence?","Thank you for the band suggestions! Actually one of my friends always wears this really sick Pig destroyer shirt and he says the same thing about them being the best grind band so now i will definitely have to check it out. "
"Would someone be kind enough to explain powerviolence?","I would suggest starting with [the entire *Prowler in the Yard* album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJGbH781DWY), it's only about 35 minutes long. It should be listened to as an album."
"Would someone be kind enough to explain powerviolence?","Fucking right, one of the best grind albums of all time, if not the best."
"Would someone be kind enough to explain powerviolence?","Thanks!"
"Would someone be kind enough to explain powerviolence?","Ok so power violence is basically grind punk. Typically it is done in a fast punky/grind all out attack, then usually goes into a mid tempo rythym, then back to a faster pace. Check out Crossed Out, Spazz, California Love, Charles Bronson. All great PV bands. The PV sound entails a grind sounding guitar, blown out bass and your typical grind blast beat or D-beat. The songs are usually short, akin to grind. If you want some good grind bands, obviously you should start at Napalm Death and Carcass. Those are pretty much the innovaters of the genre. Repulsion, early Bolt Thrower, Extreme Noise Terror, Assuck, Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Anal Cunt, Apartment 213, Pig Destroyer, Noisear, and Lock Up. All really good grind bands. Once you find a few you get into, just delve deeper and deeper man, you'll find alot of good stuff. Also if you dig crust punk, check out Discharge, Heresy, Anti-Cimex and Mob 47. All of those bands I just listed, influenced grindcore heavily.  "
"Would someone be kind enough to explain powerviolence?","Sorry for the wall of text and no links, on mobile."
"Would someone be kind enough to explain powerviolence?","Thank you for all of the information man! Also I do already listen to Napalm Death and some Carcass. I appreciate the time you took to type all that, and it's no trouble at all without links, I can type haha. 
So with PV does the punk mean there's less harsh vocals? Because i feel like I've noticed more yelling and less screaming and growling. Or is that just a coincidence?"
"Would someone be kind enough to explain powerviolence?","It's no problem. The more people that get into grind, the better! But yea, I would even say the songs have a bit more of a punk structure/feel, played super fast. As for the vocals, I would say yes to more yelling and mostly the bands usually don't growl. I remember the first time I heard the ""typical"" PV vocals, I laughed pretty hard! "

"Would someone be kind enough to explain powerviolence?","Powerviolence is the other side of the grindcore coin. Bands that draw heavy influence from the first DRI record, sore throat, siege, deep wound etc.  Basically, dudes who heard some of the illest and fastest of the early hardcore bands took that vibe and pushed it further. 

 Check out Pissed happy children, Cyclops, Neanderthal, and Man is the Bastard in that order and you can follow some of the progression from straight nasty mid 80's hardcore to its own unique freak style."

I am putting together a digital compilation featuring bands of all sizes that fall under the punk rock spectrum. This includes Crust, Sludge, Hardcore, Grindcore, Oi, Etc.

The compilation would be released for free through a digital platform such as Bandcamp. The release is TBD as it is dependent on how long it takes me to put together 20-30 songs. I am not charging anything for this, I just love the music and the scene and think it would be a fun project.

"Regurgitate - Carnivorous Erection (full album) (goregrind that isn't carcass worship)","I'm honestly not a fan of carcass at all. hate em. so since most goregrind is just a bunch of dudes who really like carcass playing carcass riffs under a different name, I'm not a fan of most goregrind.

this album has its own identity, which is awesome."

"Regurgitate - Carnivorous Erection (full album) (goregrind that isn't carcass worship)","When I met carcass a few months ago. I got them to sign my Symphonies of Sickness and reek of putrefaction albums. An I think it was Jeff that said ""I'm surprised someone so young (I'm 19) has heard these albums""

I can totally get why some people hate carcass. I (now this is only my opinion) can kinda see them as the Metallica Of Grindcore. 

As Cannibal Corpse is the Metallica of death metal. 

Just my opinion. "

Carcass and their worshippers like Impetigo, Exhumed, Impaled and so on and so on were just so damn boring. I don't care for gore lyrics at all but I don't particularly care about most of the preachy, sometimes silly political lyrics of the grind I do like either. 

Even besides the silly/awesome album cover, I always liked this album a lot too. I'd like to listen to more goregrind but any bands I try out usually just sound like early Carcass. I'd definitely love to check out more shit like this album."

"Pig Destroyer - Book Burner(Album)","What?? Look, it may not be a Cephalic Carnage or Wormrot album, but it's certainly not as weak a showing as Carcass' Swansong was either.

I think this album is awesome, but I'm curious what it is that you don't like about it."
"Pig Destroyer - Book Burner(Album)","It's pig destroyer stripped of all the character that made them great. I get that they won't make another explosions in ward 6 or prowler in the yard, but phantom limb still felt like pig destroyer. This feels like a band imitating pig destroyer. Like they don't have the heart to keep it up. I honestly think they should have called it quits when Brian left. It's extra odd because Scott still does a great job with agoraphobic nosebleed,  but I feel like piggy d lost the thread a bit ago."
"Pig Destroyer - Book Burner(Album)","I think Book Burner has some solid cuts in it, but I do agree it's their weakest album yet. However, I could see this album getting people into Pig Destroyer, that normally wouldn't listen to grindcore."
"Pig Destroyer - Book Burner(Album)","I always looked at pig destroyer as a band that rose above the idea of attracting fans. They all have regular jobs and only release and tour when they really want to. But book burner feels really by the numbers, like their doing it out of obligation instead of passion. Also, in terms of getting new fans, as a long time fan, I'm not super interested in talking to someone who only likes book burner and phantom limb. If you don't like grind you won't like the early records. It's like being a black sabbath fan but only liking the dio years

"Pig Destroyer - Book Burner(Album)","I heard it talked about so darned much that I finally caved and bought it. Worth having just for the unusually shaped packaging and pretty CDs. That said, how would it interest non-grindcore fans?"
"Pig Destroyer - Book Burner(Album)","I just feel like it's a more accessible grindcore album, if that makes sense. Like if someone really wants to get into the genre with no real idea of where to start, Book Burner might be a good jumping off point. "
"Pig Destroyer - Book Burner(Album)","I guess I could see that, although grindcore has to be among the most extreme and least accessible genres anyway. You'd be unlikely to get into it without a path through some form or metal or hardcore punk."
"Pig Destroyer - Book Burner(Album)","Oh yeah for sure. Only reason I say that Book Burner is accessible, is that I introduced this album to two of my friends, and they later ended up loving the genre."

"What makes good grindcore to you?","I've been into grindcore for about a year now, so I'm still a newbie in the scene. I want to know what /r/grindcore looks for when they try out new grind bands.

Personally, I dig midranged and lower vocals to the higher shrieks/ screams, and I'd take groovier, riff oriented songs to non-stop blasting any day of the week. That's not to say I don't like breakneck blast beats. I just don't want to listen to machine gun speed blasts for 30 straight minutes. I'm also a sucker for half decent production. I know there's a lot of stuff out there that's pretty lo-fi, and I'm sure it's awesome, but I can't really dig it if it's borderline white noise. I also can't stand anything too thin sounding. I *love* thick, heavy low end in my grind.

Just in case anyone is curious: my favorite grind bands are: Pig Destroyer, Insect Warfare, Wormrot, and Magrudergrind.

So, /r/grindcore, how do you like your grind?"
"What makes good grindcore to you?","I love my vocals high pitched. I like my riffs more punk/thrash oriented a la Magrudergrind. Basically grind that leans more towards the punk side rather than the metal end of things. "
"What makes good grindcore to you?","[deleted]"
"What makes good grindcore to you?","With a death metal influence."
"What makes good grindcore to you?","For me grind has to be more on the punky side (like the crust/grind stuff as Disrupt, Extreme Noise Terror) and vocals more high pitched or mid. I don't mind if it's straight on blasting, but it's better if there are breaks and stuff (like Nasum, btw the best Grindcore band ever). Very important are lyrics, should be political or at least personal stuff. The porn/gore stuff is disgusting and has nothing in common with grindcore."
"What makes good grindcore to you?","I prefer my grind to sound rotten...like Rotten Sound. "
"What makes good grindcore to you?","* Repulsion
* Carcass
* Napalm Death
* Dead Infection
* Terrorizer
* Assuck

It has to be on the level with those."
"What makes good grindcore to you?","/m/,"
"What makes good grindcore to you?","If it was as good as the first few Parliament/Funkadelic records that wouldn't be bad either!"
"What makes good grindcore to you?","FUNKGRIND. "
"What makes good grindcore to you?","I like my grind to be empowering - to make me fill like I want to kill someone, not myself.  Insect Warfare, Wormrot, Phobia, Agathocles, and Excruciating Terror are my favorites.  And all of those bands have achieved that perfect medium in sound quality.  The quality of their music, however, is impeccable."
"What makes good grindcore to you?","Of course I listen to grindcore with &lt;20 second songs, but my favorite is definitely &gt;1min songs."
"What makes good grindcore to you?","Old school crustgrind, which I generally mix in with thrashy late 80s UK hardcore like Ripcord or Extreme Noise Terror and fast and raw crust bands like Doom, Napalm Death (first 2 albums), Atavistic etc...I usually think of it more as crust/punk than grind.

As far as 'real' grindcore goes I'm a big fan of any West Bay Coaltion band, Agents of Satan, No Le$$, ETO, Plutocracy. The riffs, grooves and blasts have it all. I also fucking love powerviolence and I'm not really sure where the line is drawn between em. Lack of Interest, No Comment, Manpig, SPAZZ, Neanderthal, Mind Eraser, Apartment 213. All rad.

"
"What makes good grindcore to you?","It just has to be pissed off and raw and real. Emphasis on that instead of tech. Bonus always if the drummer has a good blast."
"What makes good grindcore to you?","Fun!

It's faster and more brutal than punk, with more distortion than death metal, raw expression, but it's not to be taken too seriously, without political issues, especially live it's more of a dance music. It's also my favourite guitar-genere to be incorporated into electronic music.

And there is something about those 20 seconds to one minute songs, why to listen to same chorus several times, if the idea is only for few seconds than play it only for few seconds."
"What makes good grindcore to you?","I would love to see this sort of thread over in /r/musicwithoutahome
Just created so bear with us for a while but these conversations come up quite often around here and I'd argue that a subreddit utilized to discuss music, how we define it and the technical/emotional impact these types of music influence ourselves. The heavy metal guys, the punk guy, grind, powerviolence, it's all the same shit.
I propose we join forces in musical discussion not to agree or disagree on who came from where or where it will go. Just an unbiased look at the state of things as they are, and what that means to us. Basically, an intervention.

"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","/u/about30 posted a link to a band called ""Grinded Nig"" and one of our mods (mayonesa) put it in the spam bin.

I've never heard G.N. but it seems like something that most of us would rather not see here.

Then again maybe we should support free speech and just let anything be posted, and the downvotes/upvotes sort it out.

What do you think, /r/grindcore community?"
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","I think a fair compromise would be that the ""pro-racialist"" bands have a tag indicating them as such, so that way if someone wished to click their link, they would know that they are racial"
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","That way, the ""pro-racialists"" can post their music, allowing their free speech, and giving warning to those who don't share the same ideals not to click on their link"
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","Yeah, I wouldn't listen to the pro-racist grindcore bands, but as long as it's grindcore and it gets a tag it should be given a chance.

Also, the irony of giving racist bands ""equal opportunity"" in the sub is too rich to ignore."
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","Fuck that. Everyone had the right to make the music they want, but that doesn't mean we have to support it by letting it be posted here. I don't care how good their music is, if they are racist they can go form their own sub Reddit for ignorant grindcore bands to post their music in."
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","Fuck no. If racist shit starts getting posted I'd rather unsubscribe."
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","So it's cool to post songs about rape but racism is where you draw the line? "
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","THIS. So many times this. I appreciate the sentiment of taking a stand and being anti-racist. But if we're taking cues from the community as a whole, and if we agree that grind is generally progressive or radical in it's politics, then we're morally bound to enforce these values across ALL identity lines: race, creed, sex, gender, orientation, disabilities, etc. Any less than that and we're hypocrites. (We metalheads have a BIG ASS blind spot for misogyny, as the previous commentor points out.) And because moderating in that way would be labor-intensive and subject to heated debate, I think a hands-off, free speech, let-the-votes-sort-'em-out approach is best.

The Reddit community decides every day what kind of content it wants. Let it do its thing. The truest representation of our values will emerge from that."
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","I agree with this but it can be hard to tell which bands are actually pro-racism/misogyny or are just goregrind bands trying to purposely say offensive shit/come up with offensive song titles. Bands like Regurgitate and Last Days of Humanity have song titles that can be seen as misogynistic, but I doubt the people in the bands are actual sexists, they're just trying to go for shock value."
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","Hey, I love Last Days of Humanity -- I first learned about them when my brother showed me [Bert and Ernie Go Brutal](http://youtu.be/InZNBcJTmWs), which almost made me piss myself.

I hear where you're coming from. LDoH is a great example -- they clearly want to shock and offend. I doubt they actually murder women or whatever. I've even seen videos where they have a woman in the band (playing bass I think).

That doesn't mean what they're saying isn't misogynist.

The problem with what you're suggesting is that you're supposing there's some gold standard by which we can all agree whether someone's an ""actual sexist"" as opposed to just in it for laughs. As if it can't be both at the same time. Even if there *was* such a standard, it would still be problematic. Who gets to decide who's an ""actual sexist""? What criteria does that person use? How did they get to be the authority? If that person made a call you didn't agree with, wouldn't you be pissed at them? Etc. etc."
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","I dont think this is going to change, most metal women are fucking misogynist :)"
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","i don't think it's very cool"
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","Fuck no! are you kidding? TRUE grindcore is inherently against racism, sexism and homophobia. I don't want some shite fucking nazi garbage infecting our space! "
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","&gt; TRUE grindcore is inherently against racism, sexism and homophobia.

That's a good point. As [this other guy mentioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/17t69o/christian_black_metal_band_attacked_by_fans/cavvthl?context=3), black metal can't be Christian.

In the same spirit, grindcore can't be racist.

* Napalm Death

I mean, if it's about equality. Or, you could just let people be all growed up about it and decide which links to click all by themselves."

"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","I find all the responses here really interesting. There's such a large difference in attitudes towards this sort of thing between here and /r/blackmetal. I guess it is harder to ban racist music from /r/blackmetal because of the overwhelming misanthropic traits of black metal. I do support the banning of racist music... although if it is a particularly influential piece of grindcore I think there would be reason to support allowing it. But I will go out on a limb here and assume ""Grinded Nig"" is not particularly influential or important.

I'm curious though. What does this community think of homophobic, sexist, etc. bands? Should they be allowed? Where do you think the line should be drawn?"
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","You have an insightful analysis.

Black metal has different values than grindcore. I think we'd be looking at a totally different question there.

I really hate censorship.

However, I think it's a mistake to say that any political activity of a pro-racist nature belongs in grindcore at all. Look at the founders:

* Napalm Death
* Terrorizer
* Carbonized
* Carcass
* Blood
* Repulsion

There is either no mention of race or strictly internationalist treatment of race.

If people were talking about a black metal forum trying to ban Burzum, Darkthrone, Graveland, Absurd, or any of the other nationalist bands, I'd say they were off their rocker. Black metal has a different set of values than grindcore.

However, since we're in grindcore, and all the founders of the genre are pretty much in agreement on this issue, it's nonsense to say we should be ""open-minded"" and accept ""Grinded Nig"" into this genre."
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","Darkthrone does not fit in that collection of bands you named."
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","Freedom of speech is all about not letting the government or other authorities censor us.  I don't consider it to be anti-free speech to have a subreddit that promotes grindcore but not racist grindcore."
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","racism has no room in our music."
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","Keep that shit out of music"
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","Keep that shit out of life!"
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","It's fucking grindcore. Anything goes."
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","Would also unsubscribe if that was allowed here."
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","as long as it's decent sounding, I don't really care. if ignorant s come get rid of em, give us the freedom to listen to what we want, though i do admit if I know a band's discreditable for what ever reason before hand, i wont listen to em, but if i hear their stuff before hand and i do like it, well there ya go. example, Jig-Ai. "

Very true. I don't like it at all.

But race-related politics have never been part of grindcore in any way other than internationalism. Should we just let these people invade?

TLDR; Posting things on a message board have nothing to do with your freedom of speech, nor should it."

"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","There's a difference offensive racist and humour racist. If it's for humour wise, who gives a shit. For fuck sake, black people write songs mocking themselves and other races all the time especially towards white people. Some for offensive purposes, others for humorous reasons. Look at Rucka Rucka Ali. He has racist parodies, but society loves it. They know how to laugh at themselves. Everyone is racist, don't act like you're not. 
May I also add, look at Anal Cunt. Their songs are for the shits and giggles and they wanted to be hated. It's fucking Grindcore, not pusscore. Who the hell cares, metal has always push the limits. So suddenly we all agree dissing religions which billions of people follow to heart and that's fine and dandy but racial we think ohh no too offensive? Pfft. We push limits, we enjoy it. If they are legitimately racist, then yeah they are dickweeds but for humour? Who cares. Black comedians always joke about us crackers and it's absolutely funny to laugh at ourselves, so enjoy bands with racist names. It's enjoyment. It's no different to a band called Ranchid Chainsaw Abortion, Cunt Stomper or Scorching Babies. &gt;.&gt;"
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","I'm not saying I support racist bands if they ARE racist, I'm not saying let's go spam racist songs. But, if humour wise, don't worry, have a giggle. No different to S.O.D's Speak English or Die, and they are a heavy influential crossover thrash band. "
"[admin] Should we allow pro-racialist bands?","Yes. Racism is dumb, but so is straight edge shit, and we wouldn't ban sick fix or coke bust. Racism is just one of many stupid lyrical themes that show up in grindcore. There are some bands that are racist but have awesome riffs.there is no reason to ban bands just because their lyrics are dumb. "

"What do you think about a new carcass coming out?","I won't judge it until I hear it!  They moved away from grindcore with Heartwork, but that's a classic melodeath album and I'd be happy to get another.  I'm not a huge fan of Swansong, though."
"What do you think about a new carcass coming out?","I hear Bill Steer will be doing vocals. So this gives me hope that it will be something like a style between Symphonies and Necroticism, like they have suggested it will be. I feel like that might be setting myself up for disappointment, but hey......their words, not mine. "
"What do you think about a new carcass coming out?","I'm just gonna wait and see.

Don't expect them to go back to goregrind, in the recent Decibel article about Heartwork, they said that KEN wrote most of the goregrind riffs. Ken's not involved with this record."

Our original sound was similar to Discordance Axis &amp; Noisear, but we kind of took the Crossover thing and ran with it by incorporating other random instruments that we happen to play(trumpet, digeridoo, djembe, tin whistle, etc) I'll probably release the whole thing here for free once we finish recording out latest EP, but was wondering if anyone digs on this kind of stuff as with any ""underground"" metal subgenre people tend to shit on you if it wasn't recorded with a single mic in to a tape cassette in a flooded basement, or if you have a few riffs that fall outside the genre's trademark features.  "

They were the first grindcore band to use a drum machine and introduced the concept of the grindcore mix album — both of which were largely anathema to metal and punk fans of the time. Plotkin later began creating ambient music independently and with Mick Harris."" -John Zorn"

"Does anyone know bands like bad luck 13 not really looking for sound more like there shock factor",""
"Does anyone know bands like bad luck 13 not really looking for sound more like there shock factor","Definitely NOT a grindcore band.
But if you're looking for ""shocking"" grindcore bands... Well, good ol' Anal Cunt (preferably their early stuff) and Sore Throat. Defunct french band Herpes De Crachat De Fillette (HxCxF) is perhaps my favourite ""shock-value"" band, they were a bunch of crazy motherfuckers. My favourite release is their split with Solstis. Hell, just check the Obscene Extreme Festival gallery, you'll find plenty of crazy stuff.    
If you're looking for pure shock, not necessarily grind bands, my pick is GISM : crazy early 80's japanese hardcore band, mixing brutal hardcore punk with melodic heavy metal (a shock in itself, and completely awesome), and notoriously crazy (vocalist Sakevi used to beat up the audience, throw working chainsaws at people and once attacked a salaryman in the subway with a makeshift flamethrower.). Their stuff is mighty hard to find though."
"Does anyone know bands like bad luck 13 not really looking for sound more like there shock factor","There's a great rumor about Sakevi that he was a Japanese politicians son and he shot an RPG at the prime ministers helicopter (and missed) and somehow got away with it due to string pulling.  If there was ever any band rumor I wish was true...

There's also a bunch more rumors about him beating the shit out of people wearing bootleg merch and yakuza ties etc. etc.

Also you can find the bootlegs of Detestation for fairly good prices and some of them are decent.  Unfortunately there is no good boot of their second album though, which to me sounds like speed metal Mega Man music.

"
"Does anyone know bands like bad luck 13 not really looking for sound more like there shock factor","Hahahahaha I never heard about the RPG/politician rumor, that's the craziest yet. I know he said that he would find and kill anyone who would make a website about GISM, a guy had named his GISM fansite Guy In Suicide Mission in this fashion...    I did find an excellent bootleg of Detestation years ago but it still cost me a good 50. Don't regret anything though."
"Does anyone know bands like bad luck 13 not really looking for sound more like there shock factor","damn, I lucked out and got one for $14"
"Does anyone know bands like bad luck 13 not really looking for sound more like there shock factor","These dudes are local to me and I know a few of them.  Some of them are in a newer band called Eat the Turnbuckle.  Not as crazy live but still have the same amateur wrestling antics.  I think the tunes are better though.  Never a big fan of Bad Luck's music but their show sure had an impact on me when I snuck into a bar as a 13 year old and saw a dude get his cheek ripped off by a nail baseball bat mace.

___________________________

Description:

Here is the sound of two giants locked in combat, leveling everything in their path. New York City’s most imposing purveyors of angry electronic mayhem met in pitched battle to determine who truly has the most dangerous beats in town. Digit216, the crowned king of cybergrind calamity, launched a barrage of mega-ton kicks and a seemingly infinite arsenal of bulletproof breaks. Speak Onion, the #1 boss of drum’n'noise, let loose a plague of toxic chemical synths and flesh-eating effects. After 5 rounds of chaos, the only clear winner was the crowd of on-lookers, left with gaping jaws and shattered eardrums. 

Fortunately, a pristine recording from the mixing board has been uncovered, so the historic Battle At Silent Barn can take its place in history. Immigrant Breast Nest will bring this event to light so the world can hear the dangers of armed electronic conflict and the horrors of breakcore war. Hopefully society can learn from the past and such carnage will never repeat itself. Actually, scratch that, this shit crushes. Once you get this in your head, you’ll want it to happen again on a sound system near you.

"Hey, any suggestions on playing grind on guitar?","I'd suggest the Grindcore History Route: Start playing along to some punk tracks. Then move to faster hardcore and from there pick up some fast d-beat and maybe pinch in a bit of old-school black metal. Start slow and get the feeling right then it gets easier to do it faster. "
"Hey, any suggestions on playing grind on guitar?","I used to sit in front of the TV and just play with my right hand on open strings, jump between triplets, patterns and straight blast and just keep pushing yourself to greater speed. 

I ended up with strain injuries in my hands, wrists and right elbow though so I may not be the one to ask. I can play really fuckin' fast guitar though."
"Hey, any suggestions on playing grind on guitar?","Start slow, gradually build up speed. Play with a metronome or drum track. Record yourself, get it clean slow. Listen critically to your performance. Then increase the BPM a little. Repeat.

Also, do some warm up before practicing, get your muscles loose. I often don't feel like I can get speedy until I've played for at least 20 or 30 minutes."

"Nails - Abandon All Life (2013 album) one of the better albums so far this year IMO","&gt; um, but is it grindcore? I've always felt them to be blackened hardcore

I've had this thought as well. Nails seems to come more so from the Cro-mags side of the house than Napalm Death. Think their hardcore backgrounds (Terror, et al) attests to that.

Still, great fucking band. Caught them at This is Hardcore 2013, and it was hands down the most crushing thing I've ever experienced. So, so loud.

"Napalm Death - 'Cesspits' [New Song from upcoming Jan. 2015 album]"," If they could just stop sounding like they're signed to Century Media, I could get into this. Also, it pisses me off that I could pick up a guitar and write better riffs than Mitch Harris in about 30 minutes and he insists on continuing the CHUGGACHUGGASLAYERSLAYER thing he's been recycling for the last decade. I should add that my disappointment is only this passionate because Utilitarian has become my favorite album of theirs. I really hope this is a weak point on the record. I should be more hopeful, because I remember Leper Colony being the only track they shared in advance of that album and it's one of my least favorites."

"Contempt For Humanity--Demo2014 LA Grind/PV/HC Take a listen and tell us what you think","You probably won't like what I am about to tell you, but it is not my job to sit here and ego-stroke some stranger on the Internet either. If you are genuinely interested in getting some feedback in you work please bear in mind that this is my subjective opinion. If you want to hear that you are fantastic human being and that your band is awesome stop reading now. 

I would prefer a better mix / recording, too little bass and groovy mid range. The vocals are mixed to loud. Human Tools have this annoying guitar in the end that makes a little melody, like four notes at 01:51, that thing make the whole song fall apart, it sound super naive to me. In general the guitar sound is rather shitty. I can hear certain parts when you would like the guitars to be rhythmic and drive the thing forward, e.g. 01:07 in Manufactured Dissent, it just doesn't work. I'm guessing that you are using some cheap distortion pedals for the guitars. Regardless you have no dynamics in the guitar sound and nothing to work with to make an effect. 

I'm guessing you are going for that 80's punk / hardcore sound that sound really garage and ad hoc. That is a noble thing to go for. The only problem is that out of 2000 recordings made one where a lucky accident and sounded OK. Those are the ones that people tend to remember. There is a reason Beat the Bastards is 100 euros on discogs. If you want to get something to sound like something then you have to do your homework. 

Musically it is not that new, but I cannot blame you, metal (all variations, punk, hardcore, grindcore included) tend to be super conservative. Rehashing the same old stuff over and over again. I don't mind per se since that is what the whole metal thing is about anyway and I like it. I mean, every time a band tries to break out of the mold and be innovative they get tons of shit from people that are insecure about not being metal enough. Like Carcass for example, if I would get a dollar for every time someone said ""they where better on their first album"", fuck no, they where shit compared to Heartwork, and I would be rich also. 

What else to say? I think you should be proud that you got together and recorded something. Keep rehearsing and get better at what you doing and I suppose things will fall in place one day or another. "
"Contempt For Humanity--Demo2014 LA Grind/PV/HC Take a listen and tell us what you think","Dude I needed this, thank you. The production IS bad; it is all home recorded and the guitars were run straight into the computer for after-effects. We weren't going for a clean sound and it is pretty obvious. Tapes wouldn't even be fair if we did go for a clean sound. It may be beating a dead horse, but hey, I am sure enjoying myself and I hope someone will too at a show. The community here doesn't even want a Carcass, they want something raw. At least I can say we will take your words into consideration, fix production, improve composition, and attempt to progress a scene and genre. Thanks "
"Contempt For Humanity--Demo2014 LA Grind/PV/HC Take a listen and tell us what you think","Yeah, as I said, you should be proud and happy that you came together and something, it is much much harder to so that than sit at home and complain. I know I sound super negative, that is not about you or what you do or anything of that matter, it is about my subjective appreciation of your actual music. To be fair I think there is a great deal of potential to work with, I mean you got the basics down and now it is a matter of polish and iteration. I have been playing in bands, and one thing that was all too common was that people just gave up when demos didn't turn out that great. Persistence is key! Anyway, nice seeing someone hanging it out there for some community consideration. "

"Can you guys recommend me some bands that are similar to gridlink?","To start, look into members' other projects. Mortalized was Takafumi's previous band and has a similar sound. Discordance Axis obviously. Bryan is in a kajillion bands, some better than others; Noisear's *Turbulent Resurgence* continually blows my mind but it's much less melodic than GL and takes a few listens to start to get. Human Remains is great; I'm partial to their demos. Finally, Hayaino Daisuki is basically GL with a different drummer. Ahhhhh, Gridlink. My second true grind love. After you've exhausted all the side projects etc., if you're anything like me, you'll have nowhere else to turn but Insect Warfare, who are technical and melodic in a very different sense."

"Can you guys recommend me some bands that are similar to gridlink?","Mortalized *should* be the obvious choice because Gridlink really gets more of their sound from Mortalized than they do Discordance Axis.

These choices are a little closer to DA than they are Gridlink, but I would recommend listening to Morphic Lapse and Krupskaya. I don't like White Eyes but you could check them out, too.

"Gay lyrical themes in grind","That's a good question but one I don't have an answer to.  I'm sure such a thing exists but it really seems like an overwhelming amount of grindcore is unfortunately homophobic, especially in gore and the more metal sub-genres."
"Gay lyrical themes in grind","That's probably true on the more metal side of things. Most grind musicians and fans I've met are pretty far 'left' politically and seem very open minded to other life styles. Probably the punk influence seeping in."
"Gay lyrical themes in grind","Yeah, grindcore exists at a weird intersection of hardcore crust punk and metal and the values of bands generally reflect which side they came up on."

"More like Arsedestroyer?"," I like that they're basically noisecore, but there's a high degree of intent in their sound. The drummer knows what he's gonna do to some degree, and they orchestrate their noise rather than just going nuts. I'd like the find more fusions of noise and grindcore which aren't just fucking around and making as much noise as possible. Also, grind with cool drum parts is basically like catnip for me. I like when it sounds like they're just blasting, and then you realize they're actually playing a very convoluted rhythm. Anyways, brutal stuff which eschews riffing and melody but emphasizes rhythm. It should also be noted that I really like Discordance Axis and am sick of every guitarist just recycling Slayer riffs."

I definitely have full stereo on my side (Copmuter) but I can see how HFR's mono side might cause strange issues on some setups

I'll get a hold of him and see if he doesn't mind me fucking around with his source files to at least just convert them to ""stereo"" (it would just be the same mono channel on both sides) and I'll see if that doesn't fix things

he's a very analog kinda guy"

"Best grinds of 2013?","if goregrind counts, I'll throw all that new wave of old school goregrind that makes wonders. Mainly :   
- Hyperemesis   
- Birth   
- Grotesque Organ Defilement   
- Metastasis   
- Oniku   
- Parazitozis   
- Couple Skate   
- Pancreatectomie to an extent

- Roskopp - Mutation, voodoo, deformity or disease   
- Yattaï - Fast music means love   
- Blockheads - The world is dead   
- Agents of Abhorrence - Relief   
- Agathocles/Archagathus split (this is fucking perfect)   
- Agathocles/Rotocles (Rotocles is exactly what it says on the tin)

"Genuine Question - what do fans like about Grindcore?","I have recently given a few bands in this genre a listen, including Anal C*nt, Nasum and Napalm Death. I have really tried to identify what it is that makes this music popular to some people and, aside from the naked aggression, attitude and speed of the music, I am struggling. A lot of it seems to be primarily for shock value and the music itself just feels very 'samey'. Is that just the aggression and shock value, or is there something that I am missing that I need to listen out for or work at? I am genuinely intrigued and would welcome any input. And this is coming from someone who likes everything from neo-prog, right through to black &amp; death metal. Cheers."

"Genuine Question - what do fans like about Grindcore?","• I like the political tone behind lots of it

• There's usually some really, really good guitar tones

• It's loud and aggressive

• It's goes well with powerviolence

Try listening to some Phobia or Wormrot. "
"Genuine Question - what do fans like about Grindcore?","Thanks for that - personally, I detest politics in my music, but I'm prepared to persevere nonetheless! Not tried either of those bands, so I'll go with your recommendation with thanks."
"Genuine Question - what do fans like about Grindcore?","Thanks to all those who have identified this post as a genuine request for input and not a post intended to offend or criticise unfairlly this genre. Thanks to some of the replies, I have listened more intently to several bands within the genre and am beginning to like them. So thank you. Shame about the trolls that seem hell bent on being offensive, but they can be ignored."
"Genuine Question - what do fans like about Grindcore?","Seeing as how no one is answering your question I'll give it a shot. I have only been listening to grindcore for a short time now, but as you already listed the aggression and speed are the main point that I find appealing (but then again I listen to a lot of extreme metal so this is second nature to me.) But what also appealed to me was, in the case of Pig Destroyer, was the lyrics. While just like most metal genres it can be really vulgar, but also very philosophical. Each song shows an insight, a reflection of vulgarity not easily expressed. It's also a nice change of pace after you listen to black, doom, or prog after an extended period of time. It's not necessarily that you're tired of a specific sub-genre, it's just that it's a nice change."
"Genuine Question - what do fans like about Grindcore?","This is one of the things I was gonna say. Although some of it is kind of more silly, there are plenty of grind bands with great lyrics. Whether its political or jyst about society in general. 
I also like the fact that it can simply be fun to listen to. Sometimes thats the best music there is. "
"Genuine Question - what do fans like about Grindcore?","Thank you for replying. The point about the lyrics is very interesting and it has prompted me to go back and actually explore the lyrics in a bit more detail. I must admit that, having given it a bit more time, there are some things that are beginning to click with me, but it will be a long process I'm sure...plus I doubt it will ever be my favourite genre if I'm honest. Thanks again."
"Genuine Question - what do fans like about Grindcore?","No problem, and I agree with you. Grindcore is not the most accessible genre, I never thought I'd be listening to it."

"RADIATION VOMIT - Demo 2014 (with members of Hemdale, Nakay etc.)","I believe they are doing a 7"" split with Deboned"
"RADIATION VOMIT - Demo 2014 (with members of Hemdale, Nakay etc.)","Yes, they do. ;)"
"RADIATION VOMIT - Demo 2014 (with members of Hemdale, Nakay etc.)","Also split with Headless Death in January. So for now let's just keep summoning the undead priest!!!"
"RADIATION VOMIT - Demo 2014 (with members of Hemdale, Nakay etc.)","ahhhh fuck yes!  I knew that they were doing a split with either Internal Rot or Headless Death.  Makes sense its with Headless Death since both are similar Repulsion style grind etc.  It would be awesome if it was a split 12"" LP but its way more likely that its a 7"".  Either way should be a killer release!  I am glad that its coming up soon though, I cant get enough Headless Death.  "

Also I'm assuming you're from Finland? Greetings from a neighbour to the west. Keep the grinding and drinking up!"
"My grindcore band's first EP. New EP will be recorded in near future. Check it out and tell me what you think!","Both assumptions were correct! We did use a drum machine, because we lost all our drummer candidates, but the drum machine we used sounds fairly close to real studio drums. It still is a drum machine though. We hope to find a drummer to record the drums of our next EP.
