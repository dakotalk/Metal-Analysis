"My Game of Thrones theme Metal cover [4:30] + Gangnam Style metal cover in comments","ah, good catch"
"My Game of Thrones theme Metal cover [4:30] + Gangnam Style metal cover in comments","This is awesome. Played around on my acoustic in open Cm tuning for this  song, but I like your cover more. 

Question: What did you do to sync the video of you playing each track and put it together like that? I record with a USB interface and my webcam recording software can't share the input with Ableton when I'm recording. Splitting the headphone out on my amp to the mic input on my computer works, but with a lot of latency. My amp will not play through its speaker when the USB interface is running."
"My Game of Thrones theme Metal cover [4:30] + Gangnam Style metal cover in comments","I use a USB interface to record all of the audio first.  I video tape the drum video while i record the drums.  Everything else is actually ""lip-synced"".  I have tried to film and record at the same time and it was the biggest pain in the ass in the world, so the much easier thing to do is just record the audio and then simply take a video of yourself playing along to it.  This allows for mistakes and allows me to focus more on having fun than on playing spot on correctly.  I know some people may feel pretending to play is lame, but It doesnt bother me cause obviously it's still me playing but it just makes life way easier.  Hope that helps!"
"My Game of Thrones theme Metal cover [4:30] + Gangnam Style metal cover in comments","Pick-syncing, that's what we'll call it. That makes a lot of sense. At one point, I somehow had real-time audio to both Ableton and my webcam software, but I don't remember how I did it. I do remember it involving an inconvenient combination of patch cables and software to make a virtual audio card in Windows. 

On a somewhat unrelated note, I just gave Ableton Live a test drive on an Ubuntu virtual image and it actually works (has a platinum rating on WineHQ, which means it works flawlessly). That might let me record to Ableton and a webcam program at the same time, given the flexibility of Linux audio configuration. Plus I'll finally get to ditch Windows entirely, as I've been using Ubuntu on my Chromebook for a while and love it."
"My Game of Thrones theme Metal cover [4:30] + Gangnam Style metal cover in comments","Well I'm glad you might have something figured out.  Personally, I stand by the pick-syncing method, but if you get something working doing a method then power to you! "

"My band covering Hammer Smashed Face","Hey all, Fractionally Human back again with another cover for ya.  Being lyrically challenged, I am better at covering songs than writing them, so while we work out some stuff my band did this.

It's our most popular song yet that we've done, but I'd like some actual feedback if possible.  I feel like it went really well, but I also am the one who mixed it, so that's tinted by personal opinion.

"[Black Metal] Visions, 1st Demo (6:42)","https://soundcloud.com/brianjleong/visions-1st-demo

As I mentioned on my last post, I finished up vocals for 2 songs this week. This is my longest song to date, with some doom elements added to it. The vocals are a bit louder in the mix, I think they kind of overshadow the drumming, but everything else sounds the way I want it to.

As always, comments appreciated on production, mixing, lyrics, etc!"
"I've finally finished my first demo album!",""
"I've finally finished my first demo album!","I really like the direction you're heading. If this wasn't a demo, but a good production I would be all over it. Keep on rocking!"
"I've finally finished my first demo album!","Thanks! I would have worked much harder production wise but just knowing that the drums and bass aren't real (and thus is why I'm calling it a demo) makes it hard to get the motivation."
"I've finally finished my first demo album!","Yeah I totally understand, a demo is always the first step one should be taking. "
"I've finally finished my first demo album!","Finally recorded vocals for the last 2 tracks. Working on Youtube uploads, and compiling the entire thing into one video for a full upload. Once that's done a a facebook page is set up, I'll have my first official release. For now it's available ""unofficially"" on bandcamp.

Thanks a lot for the support and advice I've gotten on this sub over the course of the year. Next step is a band, studio release, and recording an EP I've been working on forever now."
"I've finally finished my first demo album!","I dig it! Hit me up in the future if you have any desire to do a small tape release, I'd be down to do one on my label

P.S. plz get a new logo :P"
"I've finally finished my first demo album!","Thanks, I'll think about it. Currently burning CDs one at a time cause I'm stuck in the 90s or some shit

&gt; P.S. plz get a new logo :P

Had to contract a guy to do it, doesn't look quite exactly the way I wanted it either"
"I've finally finished my first demo album!","Just in case you're interested (also since I want feedback), I took your second advice.

I had been obsessing about logo redesigns and your comments pretty much kicked me into action. Definitely had problems with the old logo (especially the t and h) and like I said, I had paid someone else to do it. I'm not much of a graphic designer, but I do prefer to take matters into my own hands and after a couple of hours, I've got something I'm pretty satisfied in if you wanna take a look.

It's really damn rough (I don't have a drawing pad or anything so I had to take a picture of my physical sketch and convert it using a mouse). Went for sort of a ""Tree branch"" feel, finally got a ""t"" design I really like but I had to keep reminding myself to make sure I didn't create a swastika"

"Help with describing my band?","We are currently in the process of trying to get gigs and also changing our band name. So far, we've just described ourselves as a metal band, but we really don't get a good response from lot's of promoters as they tend to imagine blast beats and death growls, where as we have groovier drums and clean vocals throughout.

So could I ask for some help for you all to listen to [MY BAND](http://soundcloud.com/100pcrm/sets/songs) and just post here what type of music you think it is?"
"Help with describing my band?","First of all, I really enjoyed some of these songs. Track 1, 2, ""Spiders..."" and the last one in particular. 

I wouldn't hesitate one second to call it straight up ""heavy metal"". There are some clear heavy 70's references throughout (think Deep Purple, Hawkwind, and the likes) and I could probably see you do a warm-up gig for a band like Grand Magus.

On a sidenote, I could use a better and more balanced mix. I think the guitar is a bit too dominant and ""harsh""-sounding (yes, I know that sounds odd), and it drowns out the drums and vocals some places. It could be mellowed out a bit. MAybe it has excess mids?

Other than that, good work. "
"Help with describing my band?","The demo's were done round at our guitarists house and we've had real trouble balancing things. Some of the tracks have preset effects with compression that we can't figure out :/ We're pushing the limits of the hardware too so it crashes and screws stuff up.

Thank you for your comment, I'm glad you like the music!"
"Help with describing my band?","[deleted]"
"Help with describing my band?","Thank you! We did the demo's ourselves so we know they could be better."
"Help with describing my band?","If you call it ""heavy metal"", like everyone else has suggested, you won't get mixed up with bands that say they are metal but sound like [this](https://soundcloud.com/lucifers-stepdad)^^^^^shamelessplug"
"Help with describing my band?","Thanks for listening and commenting! I can't get the link to load on my mobile at the moment but I will have a listen when I can get some sweet wifi. :-) "
"Help with describing my band?","Had a listen this morning and that band (your band, yes?) is more what I'd expect from a modern metal band in terms of drumming/vocal style. So I guess the term 'metal' means whatever the zeitgeist is, whereas 'heavy metal' really indicates a more, um, retro sound?"
"Help with describing my band?","Thats what I was trying to get at, yes."
"Help with describing my band?","I concur with the people who have posted already. Heavy metal - and not bad at that at all. Keep up the good work."
"Help with describing my band?","Thanks for listening and for commenting! :)"
"Still trying to figure out this whole mixing/mastering thing. Looking for some pointers on my latest demo song.","I've posted here a few times looking for tips and I'm back again to see if i've made any progress. I'm still mainly focused on getting the guitar to sound good, so any advice directed towards that would be preferred, but I'll welcome anything. I also do all this via vsts and amp sims. I can post my settings and chain if it helps.

Here's my [latest demo](https://soundcloud.com/user4081301/premises). I'd love to get some advice or feedback. Thanks!"
"Still trying to figure out this whole mixing/mastering thing. Looking for some pointers on my latest demo song.","Not sure what drum software you're using, but I'd turn up the velocity on the snare. If it was a real drummer, it sounds like he's barely hitting the snare. Gotta smack that bastard.

Other than that, the mix is pretty full and sounds heavy. Good work!"
"Still trying to figure out this whole mixing/mastering thing. Looking for some pointers on my latest demo song.","I think the bass tone in the beginning is a little too bassy. Since it's the only instrument playing for the first third of the song, i think it should be slightly more distorted or gravely in the mids / high mids to texture the sound more and make it a little more interesting [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgeGwAeecAE#t=56). Also it would make the part where the guitars and drums come in less abrupt and flow better.

For adding a distorted texture to the bass, you could send the clean signal to a second channel and add guitar amps to distort it and cut the low frequencies [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mol6awk_aDo#t=79).

I think the guitar tones sound awesome and agree with the comment about the drums lacking some punch. so far sounding like a great mix!"
"Still trying to figure out this whole mixing/mastering thing. Looking for some pointers on my latest demo song.","The drums are lacking attention to detail.  They sound whipped out in a couple minutes and forgotten.  You got a great guitar tone, now you need to bring the drums up to that level.  Good luck, I find drums are by far the hardest part to get right in any metal mix."
"So we nailed the second place at a Contest the other day! just wanted to say thank you!","So it all started out with me, asking this subreddit about singing in a metal band two years ago. Got great advice and stayed, you're awesome! I'm proud of what we archieved so far, so thank you again for beeing a small but friendly and helpfull community.

"So we nailed the second place at a Contest the other day! just wanted to say thank you!","Sounds sweet. Work on being a little more loose on stage and you guys will do great!
"
"So we nailed the second place at a Contest the other day! just wanted to say thank you!","Let me agree with this, even if you are very nervous on stage, just a few questions which the audience will easily agree on (are you enjoying yourselves? do you like that beer?) will really get them into the show.

Moving around would of course help, but you seem to have a very small stage."

"I released a new single for my solo project 'The Raven Autarchy'","Well, metalcore has changed so much over the years that it can't really be categorized into such simple aspects anymore. It's gained some more musical qualities and progressive influences which hell I'm all for) but for the most part, music with breakdowns, really modern production, and ""whiny"" screaming is, essentially, metalcore. This song was okay imo. It's technical and cool for guitar nerds and stuff but I will have to agree with TechnoEquinox on a less dickheadish level, it's not entirely metal. It would be better with an angrier production and no triggers to me. That gating has *got* to go. But nonetheless you did a very good job, and you obviously worked a lot on it, so you get an A from me."
"I released a new single for my solo project 'The Raven Autarchy'","Most certainly is metalcore... but with man vocals.  Very cool track and sick guitar playing!"
"I released a new single for my solo project 'The Raven Autarchy'","This is Tech/Progressive Deathcore, just like my previous album ['Kaonashi'](http://theravenautarchy.bandcamp.com/album/kaonashi).

"Does anyone here like Atmospheric Black Metal with a sci-fi theme?",""
"Does anyone here like Atmospheric Black Metal with a sci-fi theme?","My two big criticisms are the guitars and the vocals. For the guitars, I think it would sound great if you upped the distortion and the volume, and make them sound 'huge'. Also, there's too much attack on the guitars. It kind of takes away from the massive 'wall of sound' atmosphere you're going for. Take the cue from Darkspace here. As for the vocals, they should also sound a bit more aggressive. Here, they sound like an angry mutter. Scream and howl into the mic, then tone it down and add your echo/reverb. Also, I might want to use slightly simpler, less snare-heavy drum patterns. If I were you, I would also try using a drum program like Hydrogen or the one built into Logic [if you use a mac]. That's the one I use for my project, and it sounds great when you play with it enough. I certainly enjoyed this song, but with some work, your future stuff could rival some of the more well-known space black metal bands. Good luck!"

I do know that hardcore screams and Slayer-esque shout singing are the most difficult vocal styles to control and master. Switching between clean and harsh is always going to be a challenge, even the best singers lose a bit of their range singing clean live"

"[x-post-ish from /r/metal] I've been directed here for a thing I'd like to do","So I made [a little video game](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/242049-Windows-Mac-Linux-Jane-Blaine-and-her-Thunder-Mane-in-Mosher-s-Delight) about a metalhead who headbangs her lightning hair at her foes to defeat them using the power of six metal subgenres.


So far, though, what I've got in the way of music is mediocre synth loops a few seconds long composed in LMMS by yours truly ([here they are back to back](https://soundcloud.com/xyy-zz/moshers-delight-the-few-loops)), and I was wondering if any of you guys and gals could help me with that.


The challenge would be to write and perform six loopable songs, one for each subgenre. The subgenres featured are classical, thrash, power, black, doom and death, in order of appearance. In the actual game, they're all played at the same time and faded in and out as weapons are switched, so it would be important for them to have the exact same tempo, length, and maybe general chord progression. The loops I've got are at 152 BPM, but very little of the game's stuff makes use of it and I set it up it so I can change it easily.


So uh, that's about it. Thanks for making it to here and keep on rocking.

**edit:** Holy crap, you guys, thank you so much. No less than six people stepped forward so far -- I'm actually in a bit of a pinch because I feel like crap asking people to make music left and right only to drop it for somebody else, but I also feel like crap turning people away."

"My guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.","I'm in the process of learning mixing/mastering in a little home studio I'm creating.

My latest [recording](https://soundcloud.com/user4081301/sonata) is a power metal song and it just sounds very flat. Even though there's no bass at the moment, I'm pretty sure even if there was a bass my guitars would still sound very flat.

I've double tracked and panned everything left and right. Here's a screenshot of all the stuff I'm doing including chain and settings for guitar and master on the bottom left- http://i.imgur.com/tBFtpvu.jpg

How can I improve this?"
"My guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.","Ok, here's the main offender: you're not using a real amp. The sound you want—what you hear in your head—it's there by association with the music you love, which is made using real amps and cabinets. However, there are some tricks to getting amp simulators to sound pretty fucking killer. 

1. This tone is allllllll mids, especially high-mids. Mids are good—that's what you're selling with electric guitar. But in metal, regardless of the subgenre, we tend to cum for those chuggy lows, so they need to strike a hair-fine balance between being recognizably present, while not occulting the bass and the kick drum. I see you've got a pretty drastic, wide-Q cut around 300-400 Hz. Smart thinking, because this is basically the most offensive part of the Misery Range (300-700 Hz), but that perception is only relevant when you've got all your instruments tracked out and you're ready to seriously mix. So kill that notch until you've got a bass thumping around.  
2. Is this amp sim patch entirely of your own creation? Consider starting with a factory preset that comes close to what you hear in your head, and altering it until it's even closer. 
3. Amp sims can sound better if your guitar signal passes through a real vacuum tube before it hits your converter. It doesn't have to be any fancy, boutique piece of equipment. At $40, [this guy](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/pro-audio/art-tube-mp-studio-mic-preamp) will work some wonders.

4. Are you aware of the concept of Unity Gain? It basically states that Unity is when an output signal is equal to its respective input signal. On hardware equipment, Unity is defined as 0 dBVU (Volume Units). However; you're working strictly in the digital domain, which doesn't measure amplitude in Volume Units—it uses the Full Scale, or dBFS. In the Full Scale, 0 dBVU is approximately equal to -18 dBFS. Here's a huge secret: When the developers are doing R&amp;D for plugins that will emulate hardware, they use signals **at -18 dBFS.** So when you have your guitar plugged in, bypass your plugins and start playing, simultaneously adjusting your gain while watching your meter in Ableton. You want your incoming guitar signal *pre-amp sim* to average at -18 (expand the width and height of Ableton's track view to display numbered meter labels). Just eyeball it until you feel that it hovers there during most playing. And as always, aim for peaks preferably under -6. If you decide to get a little tube preamp, make sure its VU meter averages at 0, while still aiming for -18 inside your DAW. If your signal is closer to what the developers used to make an emulator, you'll achieve a higher degree of realism.

Other than these tricks, go over to /r/audioengineering, and everyone there will tell you that what matters most is your perception in context. If you've been doing your research about mixing, you know that rule number freaking ONE is to **never hit that solo button,** because nobody cares what a track sounds like in solo. Don't use solo to get your guitar sounding cool. Listen to *everything* to make it sound *right.* If you were to get stems of your favorite album with your favorite guitar tone and listen to the isolated guitar tracks out of context, I guarantee you'd think they sound like ass.
"
"My guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.","Some further points regarding ""flatness."" This might be, in addition to a harmonic perception, a dynamic one. I see you've got a multiband compressor AND a single band compressor going on in the mastering chain. First of all, you don't need a mastering chain while you're tracking, because it's fucking with your perception. Secondly, these are high-gain, dirt guitars, which means distortion. Distortion is *literally* compression, so adding more on top is redundant and will easily slaughter any kind of excitement your guitars are generating if you get too heavy-handed. As for the multicomp, try engaging just the mids and highs but leaving the lows untreated. This will allow you to gently squeeze your mids and high mids, while letting your lacking lows shine through. "
"My guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.","I really really appreciate your thoughts on the matter.

As far as real amp go- yeah it would be awesome if I could have some of that really expensive gear, but as someone who's living in an apartment right now and just learning how to record I figured a good starting off point would be using amp sims and vsts since it's considerably cheaper and there are some tutorials and information out there about using them.

The amp sim I'm using is a Catharsis sim, which seems to be highly recommended in the amp sim world.

I've read some stuff about the unity. My basic understanding was to not get in the red ever. I'm using a focusrite 2i2 and once I've got the gate, overdrive, head, and cab set up I just need to adjust the gain to right under the point where I'm still in the green. Individually I've also lowered the track volumes. All the guitars are -6db. Is this on the right track? This seems a little more higher level than the stuff I've read so far.

I definitely agree about not using the effects on the master while tracking. I put all that after I was done. Honestly the only reason I added additional compression was because I haven't figured out how to increase the volume in post. Yeah, I'm still really new to this stuff...

Again thanks a lot. Hopefully I can make some more progress when I get a bass again. I'll keep playing with it and use your advice."
"My guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.","[deleted]"
"My guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.","Yep, that's exactly what you would do, with one important point: if your interface has built in pre's (as most prosumer products nowadays tend to), it probably has a multiple different input voltage modes that you choose using a selector switch, possibly labeled *mic, line, mic/line,* or *DI,* which will sometimes be called *Hi-Z*. It's critical that you use the correct voltage. [[lazy link explanation here]](https://www.google.com/search?q=impedance+matching&amp;oq=impedance+ma&amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.3649j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8)

For example, my little portable interface (mbox mini from 2010) has Mic/Line on a Neutrik connector (the combination XLR–1/4"" jack), and a separate 1/4"" jack for DI, with a push switch that selects between the two.  

When you want to plug your instrument straight in, you use your regular unbalanced instrument cable (high impedance/hi-Z, TS jack—the 1/4"" with ONE black ring), and plug it into the DI connection, making sure to select DI.  
If you're going to use a preamp in front, plug the instrument cable into its 1/4"" input, then connect a BALANCED cable (low impedance/low-Z, TRS jack—the 1/4"" with TWO black rings) from its 1/4"" output to your interface's LINE input connection, being sure to select line. 

The reason for this is that, first of all, a preamp's job is to bring a signal to UP to line level, and a DI's job is to bring a signal DOWN to line level. A DI is essentially a step-down electrical transformer. In particular with the little ART pre, it functions as BOTH. It has a step-down transformer inside it, which is bypassed when you use the mic input, but engaged when you use the instrument input. When you use the instrument input, it takes your guitar's hi-Z signal, brings it down to line voltage, and then spits out a balanced line signal. So if you plugged a line level signal into yet another DI, you'd be redundantly, detrimentally diminishing the voltage and thus the amplitude and quality of your signal. "
"My guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.","i took your advice the best I could. I started by significantly lowering the volume on each tracks volume fader. I think I did about -13db on each track except the solos.

On the guitars I also lowered the gain on the amp sim and used a different impulse that isn't as bright.

Then on the master track I added multiband compressor and boosted the highs a little and boosted the gain in the limiter.

Call me crazy, but I think this new recording sounds like an improvement. Thoughts? https://soundcloud.com/user4081301/devil"
"My guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.","I would dial the tone knob on the TSE pedal a bit, to add a little 'beef' to the mid range. Somewhere around the 2 o'clock give or take is what i do.
 You could also slightly turn down contour and presence, and turn up mids on the Legion, though depending on how attached you are to this Poulin amp, i would suggest another amp sim as the Legion's gain is too fizzy for me.
On LeCab, can i assume you aren't double tracking by recording the left and right simultaneously as your picture shows? The only time i record both the left and right at the same time is if one side is the mainsource, while the other is an ambient signal, such as a room mic impulse with reverb. Even then, i still do the same on the opposite side, essentially quad tracking. Also, try using a different impulse with a lower presence or indirect mic position, as well as adding additional impulses, such as different mics and mic positions, on top of what you have."
"My guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.","I like the Catharsis impulses too, but the preshigh ones are thin, and they're probably cutting out your lows regardless of the amp head settings. Try the pres5 or pres8 ones to let some beef back in, then go on and try MagniumXL's suggestions. You probably don't need your overdrive pedal's volume cranked all the way up, either; try backing that down to 12 o'clock and going from there. Like dropitonitshead mentioned, extra distortion can flatten your performance."
"My guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.","I'd vote that the snare drum is too loud and too dull and detracts from anything else anything else is doing. Tried maybe mixing up the effects? a slight bit of reverb, some vibrato or bends chucked in? "
"My guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.","When was the last time you changed your strings?

Edit: Also way too much gain."
"My guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.","Going direct into your PC is kind of tricky. Usually its best to layer more than 1 guitar if you can't mic up a cab, even then its always best to layer more than 1 guitar and use a stereo field expander.  I didn't spend that much and my recordings sound like bombs!"
"My guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.","Well, you still need bass, but even then, are you EQing your guitars?

"Screaming problems.","Hello.
So here's my problem.
I used to be able to scream using the ""clearing throat"" technique. I had a problem using this as it would hurt my throat (But after doing it a while it would be fine and I could go on for hours) and I had big difficulties doing lows. So I switched my technique around for something else.
Now what I was doing recently was using my throat mucus for the distortion. The problem now is that I cannot scream loudly and I don't believe that this is a reliable technique that anyone uses (Right?). Besides, this technique mostly allows me to focus of the lows, but I cannot switch from this technique to the other one as they contradict each other.

Whenever I try something new with my throat placement or whatever, it seems that the sound just doesn't come out. Or when it does I feel like it's hanging on a string, like I can feel the sound slip in my throat and it does a short ""Nails on board"" kind of sound, and this usually mean that I cannot continue screaming for the day.

I'm at a loss here. I'm not sure what to do."
"Screaming problems.","I'm no vocalist, but from being in a band a long time ago that had a very talented vocalist, you shouldn't be using your throat. 

You gotta use more of your diaphragm and push more with your gut to get a loud scream that isn't going to tear your throat up. Using the mucus in your throat doesn't sound like a reliable technique. It has to come from deeper in your chest to get the projection you're looking for without hurting yourself. 

Sorry I can't give better advice because I can't do it myself, but maybe you should look into the video called The Zen of Screaming. I know people that used that and it made their vocals 100x than they were before. 

Edit: here's a link to what I'm talking about. The guy at 38 seconds shows you what someone can do when using their diaphragm. http://youtu.be/spZWQwxNKHg"

Any idea how to remedy that?"
"Took reddit's advice on board and have made a mix I'm pretty happy with. Lucifer's Stepdad - ...Of Bashful Light. Thoughts?","The trick isn't necessarily volume, but frequency. If the snares more ""bass-y"" parts is relatively louder than the higher parts, then it occupies the same frequency as the bass, bass drums, guitars or whatever and you can't hear it clearly. The same goes with all sounds in a mix really, you should think about them as being layered not only in volume but in frequency. So in short - try boosting the highs and maybe limiting the bass on the snare and doing the reverse on the bass drum. Also, panning is your friend. Spread your drumkit out, I usually set the snare and bass drums pretty much in the middle but the overhang (is this the right word?) mics hard panned left/right, and the same with the toms. The bass tom i usually pan 50% left or right. Bear in mind that I'm no professional and only dabble in Cubase but this is what I've heard. Good luck!

Keep pumping them out and they'll progressively keep getting better and better. "
"As an experiment I tried making a doom metal song entirely with garageband (no actual instruments). What are your thoughts/opinions/comments?","Thanks. When I was making the track I was focusing more on trying to get the guitars to sound natural and less on the actual song-writing. To get the ""double tracked"" effect on the guitars I had to mess around with the distortion settings so that the one on the left side had a slightly different sound than the one on the right. Then I basically copy-pasted the riff from one track to the other and manually moved each note around so that all of the ""strings"" would sound like they were being struck at slightly different times. 

Overall I don't really like using garageband's programmed guitars since I can only make it sound realistic in this style of the longer held-out notes, and any sort of palm muting effect is impossible (or at least more trouble than it's worth to try and achieve). That being said, I'm pretty happy with how this track came out. "
"As an experiment I tried making a doom metal song entirely with garageband (no actual instruments). What are your thoughts/opinions/comments?","Ya, it's not hateful by any means (as in ""not bad""). From my experience, if you want any palm muting on synth guitar tracks, you have to make it its own separate guitar track that just handles the palm muted notes. Not very practical or efficient, but if you're going for realistic, that's about the only trick I've found. Hell, the same goes for pretty much any different technique on a guitar; you have to set up a new guitar instrument/track that gears the settings toward their respective sound."

Let's talk about your rumble delivery system. What is in it? What do you want to add or delete? What do you love about it and what do you hate? 

I'll start. I play a 6 string Warwick Thumb bass with a bolt on neck. From there, I go through a bass big muff, eq, chorus, delay, (all Boss) and finally a tube preamp. After the effects chain, I go into an SWR Workingman 15"" combo. 

This rig works for the size of shows that I play. The distortion sounds great: it's dirty but retains definition, deep, and blends well with the guitar tone. The tube preamp rounds out my tone and adds some growl. The amp is a solid state, and all I do is boost the bass a little bit, it's otherwise pretty good. 

At times the amp can be a little to bright, and I never use the horn. Also, when I turn on my chorus pedal I get really loud, I'm not sure if this is due to the amp or the effects. So much so that I have to turn down so I don't drown out the guitar. I think I'm gong to add a compressor, and I hope that solves my volume problem."
"Bass Rigs","I have a Schecter Stiletto Deluxe 5 and an Ibanez SR500 going into an older Behringer BXL 1800A 12"" combo. Boom, baby."

Baer Valkyrie &amp;  Baer ML112 x2

Pedals: Pitchblack, Darkglass B3K, EHX MicroPOG, 3Leaf Proton, Ditto

I play a lot of different stuff from tech/prog/thrash metal to soul/R&amp;B to folk-pop, so I need a rig that can cover a lot of ground and this does a very good job of it while being pretty easy to move around. 

Fortunately, the metal thing I'm in has one guitar player who uses an Axe-FX, so I don't have to worry about competing with walls of 4x12's. I still would like to have a little bit more headroom in extreme situations, but the Valkyrie isn't really in production yet and the dude has a different power section he wants to change to before full production that should up the juice a bit. Probably will get another 112 or a 212 at some point - only so much you can do with a pair of 112's.

The B3K plus the tube drive on the Valkyrie plus the killer mid-driver on the ML112's is pretty fucking brutal though."
"Bass Rigs","Those basses are beautiful. How does the micro pog handle your low B? Does it produce a low octave well? "
"Bass Rigs","Damn, nice Stammies. I was considering them briefly when I was playing sixers and wanted a body like on Tung's Wingbasses."
"Bass Rigs","Fender Jazz 4 Deluxe and a modified Ibanez SR805 run into the effects chain and from there to a Pignose B100V 100 watt tube amp head to a Fender 610 bass cab (or a small diy'd 1x15"" speaker cab for practicing).

Effects chain is: tuner &gt; Rothewell love squeeze compressor &gt; bass whammy &gt; Fuzzrocious Demon overdrive &gt; Earthbound Supercollider fuzz &gt; AMT bass wah &gt; ISP noise gate &gt; EBS unichorus &gt; volume pedal &gt; DBA echo dream delay &gt; Akai Headrush loop/delay.

Works pretty great for making lots of loud, spacey, rumbly noises!"
"Bass Rigs","I love rumbly space noise! Why the two fuzz pedals? Do you use them arty the same tone, our just to have a choice of fuzz tones? "
"Bass Rigs","Just one fuzz actually. The Demon is a Fulltone OCD clone (overdrive/distortion) with more gain options and a huge low end. I usually run the fuzz pedal with the overdrive on to get a less nasal fuzz tone. The Supercollider is muff based, so similar in tone to a bass big muff but with more clipping options, a bass filter, and blend.

Together they get a very sludgy sound, perfect for High On Fire / Electric Wizard-ish stuff."

"Feedback on my master? (Mix + master inside)","First, I'm no expert, I propably won't do better than you. But I would do differently.

I thought the mix was muddy and lacking punch, but I like the sounds on their own.

I was surprised by the huge difference in the master : the punch is back, but you have a big problem of ""pumping"" I think. The volume really drops sometimes, you must be more gentle on the compressor/limiter. And probably adjust your levels (and automate them, but not too much !).

Hope this helps !"
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","I have great writing chops, I know how to rhythm guitar and follow changes with drums or bass, but when someone says ""play me a solo"" I lose every momentum and just fuck up entirely.  

I have sat down and learned some scales and what not, but I still cant get into solos. Like I just cant feel the emotions or grooves or form a sweet lead riff for me life. I don't get it. Its like a part of me that was cut out from my mind. How the hell do I sit down and learn to play the lead guitar? "
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","i suggest learning existing solos that you like, doing this will make you learn the techniques and motifs that are present in the leads. then you can use them to influence your own leads."
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","I recommend investing in some type of looper pedal. Use it to practice leads over other riffs you have written. You know your scales, so you already have a great starting point. Now it's just a matter of experimentation. Best of luck!"
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","This. Sometimes I just throw a chord progression into a looper and then just play over it for an hour or two. It really helps."
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","[deleted]"
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","Expertise: I've been playing lead guitar for about five years now. You can hear some of me and my bandmate Joe's solos on our bands record.  [\[link\]](https://amiensus.bandcamp.com)  I pride myself at being pretty damn good at improvisation too.

Here's some tidbits I randomly wrote down to help you learn how to crank out some solos. 

If you're going to practice this, I suggest doing so alone and in a forgiving manner. if you fuck up while practicing, you fuck up. Everyone does. You're going to. It's part of the grind, just refocus and move on. The worst thing you can do is get discouraged because then you will definitely fail. Calm your nerves and just play around. 

Hippy poetry aside, my first suggestion would be to learn the pentatonic scale. This scale is powerful and your knowledge of it is actually probably already innately programmed into you. [\[source\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne6tB2KiZuk)

After you get the pentatonic scale down, I suggest either googling/spotify ""Blues Jam tracks"" or just general jam tracks to just practice soloing with. Gradually mess around with just jamming over your favorite tunes. 

Another great exercise involves not playing the guitar at all at least in real life. Listen to a song/jam track and simply create the tune in your head. Don't worry about what it would look like on the fretboard, just focus purely on melody and note/phrase choice. 

If you wanna get fast, you gotta do those scale runs. I suggest using a speed trainer in a program like Tuxguitar or GuitarPro. Go from 1/4th bpm up to full bpm and even to 1.5bpm to master whatever lick you want in a clean fashion.

Vibrato is really important. It took me forever to realize this. A distorted guitar lead without it sounds amateur. (depending)

This is at least how I got to where I am, of which I am pretty happy. Best of luck dude!"
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","One exercise I do for vibrato is to pick a note just once and then
try to sustain it for a long time (you can go by seconds, or count the
number of ""wobbles"").   Shoot for 8-10 vibrato cycles for each
time you pick and your playing will be singing in no time.  "
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","I usually use Electric Funeral by Black Sabbath to practice vibrato.  The main riffs use a ton of vibrato, underneath the wah, and they sound dead and boring if you don't use any.  Plus, the main riffs are all on the 1st-3rd frets, making the strings harder to bend, which builds up finger strength. "
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","I'm not sure what genre of music you write for but the way I usually approach solos is by writing some sort of melody that goes along with whatever chords are being played.
How do you decide what is a good melody to play?
Since you say you have writing experience treat it as you would the notes for lead vocals. Make it 'singable', then after you have a good basic melody down, add some flair. Fast runs down the right scale or arpeggio of a chord in the place of a few nets can be very effective; that being said every song is unique so don't overdo it!
"
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","It helps to have a good feel of the guitar. As rhythm players, we have a good understanding of where to place our fingers on the first 7 frets. But higher on the neck and we tend to feel less comfortable.

One thing I often do to familiarize myself with the neck is to get on YouTube and search for backing tracks (usually jazz in Em) and play clean solos over them. I don't worry about adhering to certain scales or patterns, I just play in key and get a feel for the song. Playing clean also helps you hear the notes you're truly playing instead of masking minor mistakes in distortion. "
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","Scales, lots of them.  Start of slow, build accuracy and after you've got that start building up that speed.  Learn them well, and learn many variations of them.  The more you understand that the notes and the key in which you are playing the better you can write riffs.  The better you understand your riffs the better you can pick out the changes, the mood, the note progression.  If you understand that then you're on your way in to feeling those spots the solo fits over.

  While your doing that, covers of songs you like.  Tell yourself ""Right, this solo from this song I like, I'm going to learn that sumbitch!"".  Tell yourself that then try and do it.  If you can't pick something that sounds easier in another and get to it, come back to that hard one later.  If you do nail the first solo you pick, make yourself learn another one that's harder.  Progress and always move forward to new and better things.

  Hard work and theory, they're not dirty words. :)"
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","Learning leads you already like by other bands is a good start. 

In terms of *writing* leads though, I find it best to work in sort of a piecemeal fashion. Write a little piece at a time, and practice each section until you have them so solid you could play them while closing your eyes or watching TV or some such. 

Just doing a total improve over metal parts is, in my experience, not necessarily going to lead to something satisfactory, especially since leads in metal tend to be very fast, so that putting feeling and/or meaning behind the playing tends to become quite complex to achieve, and lots of players make metal solos that sound like masturbational fluff. 

Good luck!"
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","You need to learn everything you can about chords and hwo they are constructed before you can get into lead guitar. Remember, if you truly want to play something beautiful, don't try to solo over music. It's been done forever now and all it takes is memorizing a bunch of licks and scale. If you want to write something good, learn to play leads with the music, which requires you to know what chords you're playing with"
"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","* A looper is a good investment if working from scratch
* Find a Djent band like Tesserect, most of their tunes are based on low open notes so you can essentially practice I believe C or B# minor over the entire album.
* Chords Lead to Arpegios which are the main notes used in the chord you are soloing over.
* Learn the CAGED Pentatonic Minor positions.
* Practice bending the 4th to the 5th, 7th to the Root, 2nd to 3rd
* 12th position E minor and A minor (hint this is also E Phrygian) Box and 3 note per string versions.
* My speedy 3 note per string E minor and A minor (Whole Whole Fingering)

"Okay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?","You know your modes?

You know your scales?

You know any solos?

You know how to play any songs 1000% the way through? 

Because you need to be able to do all of this to even begin to approach writing a solo.

A solo is a self-contained song within a song. A solo rips you from the song in a way that is relevant to prosody as well as relevant to the player / genre (meaning, 32nd note runs in reggae would be fucking weird). 

Approach it logically. Make a library of licks. Learn a new _song_ every day. If you can't manage an entire song, learn half of one. Or a quarter. Just keep adding to your expertise, it can only help you."

So I've been looking at some drum machines for that purpose. Can anyone recommend any good drum machines for recording metal drums?"
"Good Drum Machines for Metal Drumming (x-post from r/metaldrums)","EzDrummer 2. Hands down the best for 'creating' custom drum tracks. The new features they added are pretty incredible really. Go to youtube or the toontrack website and watch demos on what it can do. The stock sounds are at least decent and you can upgrade them with better sound packs. (Metal!, Metal Machine, &amp; Metalheads all pretty awesome.) There is a free demo you can download from their website as well. i recommend watching those demo's first though so you have a better understanding of what it's capable of first."
"Good Drum Machines for Metal Drumming (x-post from r/metaldrums)","And once you learn EzDrummer and get proficient at that, get Superior Drummer. It's EzDrummer on steroids. "
"Good Drum Machines for Metal Drumming (x-post from r/metaldrums)","With what ezdrummer 2 can do now, there's really no need for superior. In fact, superior, unless they release a new version soon, can't touch what ezdrummer now offers in the way of custom midi song creation. "
"Good Drum Machines for Metal Drumming (x-post from r/metaldrums)","Are you or anyone else here able to do a tl;dr regarding ezdrummer 2 vs the drum programmer in logic?  "
"Good Drum Machines for Metal Drumming (x-post from r/metaldrums)","The new drum thing they have in logic is a more simplified, less fluid, with less options variation of what is able to be done with EZD2. EZD2 sells itself with the tagline ""talk to your drummer"" and it's actually pretty true. It allows you to feed it a starting beat and it can very quickly and easily help you build an entire 'varied' song in a matter of minutes just off the simple 'kick &amp; snare' beat you fed into it. That's not possible in the same way in Logic Drummer. While the logic drummer is for sure a neat little addition to the DAW, it's no where near what EZD2 can do. "
"Good Drum Machines for Metal Drumming (x-post from r/metaldrums)","I guess that's actually fairly long lol. So tl;dr: If you want to write quick, full custom drum tracks with lots of variation at lighting speed, buy EzDrummer 2. "
"Good Drum Machines for Metal Drumming (x-post from r/metaldrums)","EZDrummer 2 definitely looks cooler than before, but to program drums in it, you still have to either do midi sequencing (which is really tedious), or have a midi controller (which I don't have). 

Normally, when I come up with a riff, I have a drum track going on in my head along with the riff, and what I want to do is bring that imaginary drum track to life by actually playing the drums, as opposed to programming them in EZDrummer, Cubase, Hydrogen, etc. Because that gives me more control over my rhythm and drums. So to that end, I wanted to know what are some good drum machines for laying down metal drum tracks."
"Good Drum Machines for Metal Drumming (x-post from r/metaldrums)","For someone that types up their own original MIDI for everything, is EZDrummer 2 worth it? I envisioned it to be better for people that liked pre-made beats or a way to build drum tracks out of existing MIDI. (I currently own both Superior and EZDrummer 1.)"
"Good Drum Machines for Metal Drumming (x-post from r/metaldrums)","If you have the money get Superior Drummer. It's expensive but definitely worth every penny. Ion get a SHIT TON of AMAZING sounding samples and midi. 

I mean the time and effort these people put into making something this huge is insurmountable. 

EVERYTHING is customizable. And I mean EVERYTHING from the mic placement to the amount of bleed you want each mic to send to the main mix. 

It's by far my favorite. "
"Good Drum Machines for Metal Drumming (x-post from r/metaldrums)","Well considering I don't like paying hundreds of dollars for software, and I dunno how to torrent, Hydrogen works just fine if your randomize and use acoustic drum samples. You'll have to do the EQing in another software though, but I think it's better that way so that you can mix it with everything else better."

First, let me tell you a little about my self.I started playing guitar at a very young age because of my dad inspiring me to.The very first song I ever learned was, of course, smoke on the water by deep purple. I was so proud of myself, until one day, my dad told me about a band called ""Metallica"" which is what started me being really serious on guitar. I played Metallica covers for years until I turned 13, which is when I decided to come up with my own stuff, and also screw around with music production software (at the time, audacity lol).

"Big day for my band! Existem - ""Phoenix"" EP released today. Feedback would be greatly appreciated!","Zack Alvey of Covenant Studios in Kansas City did the EP. We did drums and tracked the raw guitar and bass DI at my house then brought the tracks to him for reamping, vocals, mixing, mastering, all the rest. Its the same studio that produced the latest Norma Jean, Hope for the Dying, and Everything in Slow Motion. Those guys are phenomenal at what they do. "

I've put together a short collection of samples from my upcoming debut demo, entitled Despair the Withered Shadows. The recording is mostly done except for vocals on the final track. These will have to be postponed until November. After that I will work on final mixing and mastering, and then hopefully it will be released in December or thereabouts. The first song, The Approach of Horns, is available in full for free download on my soundcloud page, as well as Arms of Many-Coloured Glass, the original version of the song now titled Chapters in Solitude: https://soundcloud.com/dr-ug-1

"Looking for a cab with a lot of GIRTH","I need something to match up with a peavey 6505+.  I play in a progressive/melodic death metal band doing rhythm.  I listen to a lot of stoner and doom, so I like that really powerful thick sound.

  there is a marshall 1960a on sale near me for 350 used (obviously) but they seem to sound a little thin from what I can tell via shitty youtube videos.  
Any suggestions?  I'd like to go under 700$ "
"Looking for a cab with a lot of GIRTH","If you're looking for girth and stoner-doom sounds, bass cabs are a great option.

A 2x15 or a 4x10 would do nicely for live stuff. You could probably find 1 or 2 decent Sunn cabs for around that price. Just make sure you can match the impedance. A lot of bass cabs are 2 or 4 ohm input, which can be hard for a guitar amp to do.

"
"Looking for a cab with a lot of GIRTH","I've actually really wanted to use a bass cab because I also play bass and having one for both would be great financially and space wise."
"Looking for a cab with a lot of GIRTH","Make sure you get one without a tweeter or a tweeter that can be turned off, you don't want heavy distortion going through one of those, it'll sound fizzy and crap."
"Looking for a cab with a lot of GIRTH","I got an Ashdown 2x10 for the same reason, paired it with my Peavey VK100. And I play Stoner/doom primarily, but I have a fuzz pedal that adds a lot of balls to my low-end. "
"Looking for a cab with a lot of GIRTH","You could potentially find a second hand Orange cabinet in that price range, they have really solid construction which I believe gives them quite a thick tone. As you probably know, loads of stoner and doom bands use them. "
"Looking for a cab with a lot of GIRTH","A 1960 is a great cab.  5150s do fine on them."
"Looking for a cab with a lot of GIRTH","1960A is a good cab. I have a custom ported 1x15 cab with a 200W Jensen Electric speaker in it... it's really great for sludgey metal tones. It's bassier than my Mesa 4x12 (not as tight though, since it's ported) and it's loud as fuck. Might want to check into something like that. I paid $600 for it new from a local guy who builds custom cabinets."

"Looking for a cab with a lot of GIRTH","Remember as well, there's more than just the cab as a whole. It's the speakers working in conjunction with the wood that the enclosure is built from. If all else fails then change out 2 of the speakers for something that has a bit more of a low end response. I'd start with the celestion gt-75s. The 1960 is a solid cab though. Try running it at 4 ohms if you can."
"Looking for a cab with a lot of GIRTH","Yeah, I was thinking of doing gt-75s and V30s in an X pattern later.  Why 4 ohms? I know about matching impedance between the head and cab, but why would one be inherently better? "
"Looking for a cab with a lot of GIRTH","I've played a lot of 1960 cabs at 4 ohms and they for some reason just sound a little thicker, granted this takes into effect if they want you to go that low. I've found that there is a slight sonic difference between 4 and 8 ohms. The low end sounds bigger and the high end is a little more ""glassy"" However there are a few 1960 cabs that want you to run at 8 ohms. The v30s are a great match too for the gt-75s are well. This creates a nice blend for playing live as well as recording. However, when you are recording, start by micing the V30 first. It wont have as much high or low end but that's ok because the mic and the placement will help determine the sound you want at that point."

"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Recently got into a debate in /r/guitar because I mentioned I didn't consider Iron Maiden metal anymore. It seems to me that since genres are solely determined by people who write articles and edit Wikipedia, it should be totally acceptable for people to have their own interpretations of what does and doesn't fall within a certain genre. In light of the growth of death metal, hardcore, and related subgenres in the past 30 years I now call modern metal simply ""metal"" and Metallica, Maiden, and derivative modern bands (Avenged Sevenfold, Arch Enemy etc.) ""heavy metal."" This is mostly because I'm much more into the former style and don't want to have to refer to whatever inane sub-genre of metal all the time in conversation. I was catching a lot of flak for this at r/guitar, they think genre lines are set in stone and not open to interpretation, so I was wondering what a more metal crowd thinks."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Iron Maiden is metal. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. In fact, they're pretty much the definitive metal band. There was a time when metal was more subjective (ex: Metallica was initially called power metal rather than thrash metal), but the lines are generally drawn in the sand when it comes to older stuff.

There can be times when it's open to interpretation, but this isn't one of them."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Huh I never knew power metal originally meant thrash metal. I guess I just make an artificial division in my mind between what I call ""heavy metal"" (power, thrash, styles that generally use conventional verse-chorus-solo song structure) and what I call ""metal"" (death, prog, in general stuff that has chaotic rarely-repeating song structure). It just seems to me that Maiden has more in common, for example, with AC/DC than with Beneath the Massacre. Sure AC/DC doesn't chug or do sweet harmony solos but the song structure is such a big sticking point for me that I hesitate to group Maiden and Beneath the Massacre together. "
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Think of it this way: rock is a huge style of music that encompasses hundreds of styles. Both Molly Hatchet and Airbourne are rock, but one is southern rock, while another is hard rock. In the same sense, Iron Maiden and Cannibal Corpse are both metal, but one is traditional heavy metal and the other is death metal.

Subgenres have a lot more purpose than you are letting them. Sure, it's true that they're somewhat created by record labels and the media, but they stick because they're useful. If you tell me a band is metal, I don't know enough about them to tell if I'm going to like them. On the other hand, if you say they're thrash metal, I'm almost certain I'll like them. Consistency is an important part to naming subgenres because otherwise they have no meaning.

Also, I don't know if power metal used to mean thrash metal. With respect to Metallica, it did (though that might be because one of their demos was called ""Power Metal""). In general, subgenres were a little less rigid in the early/mid-80's as they were still being developed. Some bands are still incredibly hard to categorize because they straddled the line well (ex: Metal Church)."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Beneath The Massacre is deathcore though. Even though they lean more on the metal side of the fence than hardcore. So you're kind of muddying the argument by throwing that in there, by default."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","If I'm going to play into the subgenre game I'd lean much more towards tech death for BTM, sure they have a breakdown every now and then but they're not overusing them in my opinion. But since they do use some breakdowns I guess they could be called deathcore. In the end what I want to get across is that genres and subgenres are an ambiguous way to classify music and nobody should be getting too hung up over another person's classification scheme. After all I think most people outside the metal world think of ""heavy metal"" as a subgenre of rock, which historically I guess it is."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Tech Death and Tech Deathcore is often a very fine line.

&gt; In the end what I want to get across is that genres and subgenres are an ambiguous way to classify music and nobody should be getting too hung up over another person's classification scheme.

But the thing is subgenres exist because many people agree on them. "
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Black Sabbath is still metal, and it doesn't sound anything like some of these modern breakdown weedily deedily bs bands that pass for metal nowadays."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Metal theory is open to some interpretation. This old curmudgeon bullshit 'this new stuff ain't metal' is, without a doubt, totally not metal and is a habit of elitist internet fans, non-concert going posers."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Bull. I don't think most metalcore/a lot of deathcore is metal and I go to concerts, as do a lot of other people that feel the same way. Nu-metal, too.

People always seem to forget that most of us saying that aren't being malicious- metal=/ good, after all. We're just happen to think that since metalcore came out of punk and most modern metalcore has barely any metal influence, it's punk rather than metal. Is that so wrong? "
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Right on answer. I gotta disagree with classifying Deathcore as anything similar to 'metal'core. Metal core is pop with distorted guitars called metal core cuz it's marketable. Much like in the 80s they called that synth pop shit punk rock... Deathcore is actually death metal and hardcore, it's brutal as fuck. I prefer slam death but it's still brutal metal. "
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","&gt;I gotta disagree with classifying Deathcore as anything similar to 'metal'core. Metal core is pop with distorted guitars called metal core cuz it's marketable.

Metalcore covers a massive range of sounds, mate. It can mean anything from 90's metallic hardcore (Hatebreed, Shai Hulud, Converge, Botch, etc) to mathcore (also Converge and Botch, The Dillenger Escape Plan, etc) to early 00's Gothenburg/thrash influenced metalcore (Trivium, As I Lay Dying, Unearth, etc) to bands toeing the line with between -core and Pantera worship (Lamb of God, Sylosis, Chimaira, etc) to later post-hardcore + early metalcore (Asking Alexandria, whatever's on the front page of /r/metalcore, etc). Out of those, the 00's Gotherburg/thrash and the groovey metalcore can be considered metal- the riffs are more metal, though hardcore influences are more evident than they would be in pure thrash, melodeath, or groove.


&gt;Deathcore is actually death metal and hardcore, it's brutal as fuck.


Similarly, deathcore's sound can range between stuff that's basically the harsher side of metalcore + death metal (early Whitechapel, early The Red Chord, All Shall Perish, Acrania, Thy Art Is Murder) to metalcore with a death metal tone, more chugging and breakdowns than not, and occasional death-y riffs (later Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, various crappy Hot Topic bands). More deathcore than metalcore is metal, to be certain, but a lot of the Hot Topic bands have very little metal influence past their tone and vocalists- they're basically bad downtuned/dropped lowest string hardcore with growls. 

Will I call early Whitechapel metal? Absolutely. Will I call a band that just chugs along with no obvious lineage to Sabbath and Priest metal? Nope.

TL;DR: Some metalcore/deathcore is metal, some isn't, and I feel like I just spent more time than I should have on a typeup nobody's gonna read."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","I read it lol, it's pretty watertight too. Great examples. Any argument would just be splitting hairs. Just try not to use the phrase 'Panetta worship' is a derogatory way... not a bad read... thoughts on Grindcore vs tech death?"
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","I don't mean it in a bad way- it's just what it is, just like how a lot of the death metal I listen to is Incantation or Death worship and how some of my favorite thrash is Morbid Saint worship. Guess I could have said ""Exhorder worship"" as well (or just left it at ""groove metal"", but that'd be less likely to be true- Pantera is way more popular, after all. 

&gt;thoughts on Grindcore vs tech death?

I love grind, though I'm not as familiar with it as I probably should be. Favorite bands- Wormrot, Napalm Death (Scum to Harmony Corruption, I think?), Terrorizer, Carcass (early), Liberteer. Def need to up my grind game- probably going to hit Insect Warfare and some other essentials tomorrow to level the playing field.

 I like some tech death (Artificial Brain, Suffocation, Cryptopsy, Wormed, Atheist, Cynic, Death, Hellwitch, Desultor, Ulcerate, Gorguts, Necropolis, Exmortus, some others) but I really, really don't like the current wave of tech-wank with clean production- I'd rather listen to non-technical death that has good riffs than some Necrophagist-meets-Opeth band without many cool riffs.

I've heard some cases of tech death and grind meeting in the middle- not a ton, and none I can remember off the top of my head, tbh, but definitely some- that sounded pretty cool, but in general, I just don't listen to a ton labeled ""tech""- tends to have fewer cool riffs, and I really do listen to metal mostly for cool riffs. 

No hate on people that love tech or the bands- they're just a trend I'm not particularly fond of.
"
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","But you agree it's a little weird having Sabbath and breakdown-heavy shit in the same genre? They don't sound anything alike to me either."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","That's what subgenres are for. "
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Mmmm. Although I agree with you in principle, I don't think this is the case anymore. 'Metal' is no longer a category that has sub-genre's within it. 'Metal' seems to mean 'Whatever the most current popular overall sound of metal is'.

Iron Maiden would be classified as Heavy Metal now. 'Heavy Metal' was originally a category that had it's own sub-categories (in the same way that 'Metal' used to be), but now it's a genre all on it's own.

The 'Metal' description seems to be the equivalent of 'Pop', but for heavy music. When you talk about 'Pop' music, the yardstick of what is considered 'Pop' wavers depending on what's currently in vogue. Such is the same for 'Metal'.

I'm not saying I agree with that at all, but that's just how it appears to be. I would prefer it if 'Metal' was still a generic category."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","My understanding is that [pop is actually a genre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music) distinct from ""popular music"" even though that's where the term derives from. Rap and rock are both very popular but don't fall under pop, for example. 

Similarly, metal is a genre. It has nothing to do with what's in vogue- it's based on shared musical characteristics. "

&gt;__Pop music__ (a term that originally derives from an abbreviation of ""popular"") is a [genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre) of [popular music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music), which originated in its modern form in the 1950s, deriving from [rock and roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll). The terms ""popular music"" and ""pop music"" are often used interchangeably, even though the former is a description of music which is popular (and can include any style).

&gt;As a genre, pop music is very eclectic, often borrowing elements from other styles including [urban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_contemporary), [dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music), [rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music), [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_music) and [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music); nonetheless, there are core elements which define pop. Such include generally short to medium-length songs, written in a basic format (often the [verse-chorus structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verse%E2%80%93chorus_form)), as well as the common employment of repeated choruses, melodic tunes, and [hooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(music\)).

&gt;So-called ""pure pop"" music, such as [power pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_pop), which has been described as mixture of [hard rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock) and melodic pop music  and tends to be more aggressive than [pop rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_rock),  features all these elements, using [electric guitars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_guitar), [drums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit) and [bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar) for instrumentation.

"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Well let's hope so. As I said, I'd much prefer that people think Metal is still a genre, but I've had a lot of discussions on that topic recently and unfortunately I don't think that's the case :("
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","If people don't think metal is a genre, those people are uneducated on the subject. It's really that simple, m8."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Nothings ever simple. You and I can rant however much we like that Metal is a category of music rather a genre all of it's own, but if the general populace do not hold that to be true then we become the ones who are wrong. In much the same way, I knew a loy of older people in the 90's who would swear blind that 'Grunge is just punk-rock, stop calling it grunge,', and I just laughed and said 'Yeah, get with the program grandad.'"
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","No, I mean, music genres are literally based on music theory and no amount of ignorance about music theory can change that- that's like saying that science changes because so many people have misconceptions about it.

If metal stopped being a genre, well, all of the current bands would be part of the same genre still, it'd just be called something else. 

People have been calling non-classical music ""classical"" for ages and music theorists just ignore them. "
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Science does change.

For a very long time it was scientific fact that the Earth was flat. We look back and think that's very silly now because we have observed the world as a sphere. But if you had lived back then, you be arguing vehemently against anyone who said otherwise.

Any 'theory' as such is only held to be true when you have a large enough amount of the population that believe in it, hence, being called a theory. There have been more than one type of musical theory throughout human history arising from different cultures and such. It's kind of unified now, but even still, uniquely human.

So I'm afraid I don't agree with you that things are ever set in stone. Even though there may be wikipedia articles that attempt to categorise and classify things, those are just static snapshots that represent the opinions of the people that wrote them at the time. Music has a long repeating history of the younger generations adapting, changing and renaming their music and it always pisses off the previous generation, who did their own adapting, changing and renaming."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","There are some good answers here, but I want to add that I think you're getting the purpose of genres backwards.

Genres exist so that we can classify and group works (songs, albums, whatever) that have ALREADY been created. No one ever sat down and said ""I'm going to create a new genre called Technical Death Metal"" and started writing an album. It really works the other way around; we already had a genre called Death Metal with its own established rules, some bands just started going in a specific direction with it that was different than what other bands had done before them. We as metal fans started to get a feel for what those differences were (whether consciously or subconsciously) and started calling those bands Tech Death instead of just Death Metal."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","This reminds of when a student goes to into their first Algebra course, and it's all fairly straight forward early on. But the fact that they missed out on some basic concepts earlier in middle school means the rest of the year is overcomplicated and things don't match up, and they're pulling at all the crumpled notes they took just trying to make meaning of it all, and they just keep nodding ""yeah i get it...no i don't need help"". I think you may have missed one of those pre-algebra classes. "
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Could very well be, I haven't listened to older metal in years. But unlike mathematics which is self-consistent and proceeds only by indisputable proofs, the names of genres are just labels made up by record companies and the media. So I guess I just don't see why they need to be so set in stone.  "
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","&gt; genres are just labels made up by record companies and the media.

This makes no sense record companies don't invent a genre and then get a band to make music in that genre - the companies get a band to release an album and the listeners, the metalheads, classify it in order to easily identify and a share the music. 

Anti-classification is so irrational I don't comprehend how there's a whole group of people promoting it. It would be like biologists promoting that they get rid of the Latin naming conventions because 'reasons'"
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Well they made them up after the fact to group bands together based on similarities that people may or may not agree are good similarities to base it on. That makes it even worse in my opinion because in many cases a band will not accept the subgenre they are filed into, for example The Red Chord has said several times they hate being called ""deathcore"" because that wasn't even a thing when they started making music. "

They being musicologists and fans educated on the subject, mind. 

"
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","I think metal is a unique genre in a sense that you can quantify how accurately it matches a desired archetype. While metal has flowered into a dozen different sub-genres and encompases all sorts of musical ideas, tones, techniques and disciplines, metal music still has a common denominator: it's *extreme*. Bands we consider more extreme, we consider to be more metal than bands that are less extreme. That's why you get so many more metalheads with strong allegiances to bands like Gorgoroth or Deicide, throwing up the horns and saying *that's so metal* than you do with oldschool bands these days. It also explains why there are a lot of young guys who don't see Iron Maiden as metal. Relatively speaking, they aren't *extreme metal*, but they're still *extreme*, and thus metal. You personally might disagree, but they still employ distorted guitars, advanced technique, speed, and dark (or at least masculine, powerful, energetic) lyrics.

Where it gets confusing is when you throw punk or hardcore into the mix. I think the rivalry between the two genres exists because one audience thinks their music is more extreme than the other. Most 80's metalheads labeled themselves as such because they thought the advanced speed and technicality of metal fused with its dark imagery out-disgusts the raw primal anger and noisiness of punk. That argument has largely been replaced with the modern rivalry between metalcore and ""false metal"", or the commercialization of punk rock, alternative, and hardcore mixed with a few metal elements like heavy tone and technicality. Puritan metalheads see the less extreme features of this music like emo styled lyrics, clean or whiney singing, and pop hooks and bridges as grounds to exclude it from metal. They have a point, but their iron stubbornness gets in the way of people trying to enjoy the music, not to mention that in some instances people dismiss legitimately *good* bands as bad ones solely on the basis that they aren't as metal as they could be, which is a fallacy because metalness =/= goodness."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","I get what you are saying, but if anything, the old stuff if ""metal"" and this new stuff has outgrown it and should have a new name.

I'm not saying I agree with that, but I'm saying you have it backwards. 

Anyway, if I answer your question without reading the additional info, yes. Yes, metal is open to interpretation. Solstafir will be posted on the same site as Gojira and Black Sabbath. Does it sound similar? Nope.

But then again, Black Sabbath used to tour with Megadeth. How alike do they sound? A lot less similar than Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Yet one is rock, one is metal. Am I jumping around in my argument? Yup. It's because it doesn't matter too much. It's all noise that we name.

I'm that guy who hears -core music and tells my friends, no that's not really metal. Do they understand why? Nope. But it doesn't really matter."
"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","Hah okay I guess I will start calling it ""br00tal metal"" or something around here. It's just common amongst my circle of friends to refer to death metal and its offshoots as ""metal"" and to anything -core as ""hardcore"" so I was wondering what everybody here thinks the ""metal"" means in metalmusicians"

"Do you think what constitutes ""metal"" is open to interpretation?","*Disclaimer: I don't at all keep up with currently accepted terminology, so I could be totally talking out of my ass here, but this is the view from Mt. Wombat*

While I know what you mean and I largely agree that OVER-genrefication (real word? maybe? Whatever; it is now.) makes things way too complex, especially when there are like 4 bands in each genre because it is way too specific, I do have to say that we do indeed need SOME genrefication to make conversations easier and make comparisons more clear. 

That said, Maiden is indisputably metal, dude. I think it would be fair to lump many early metal bands into a ""classic metal"" group to more easily distinguish them from modern thrash or power or whatever metal genre that has had significant growth since they were established. On the other hand, I don't think it would at all be out of place to still call those bands thrash or power or whatever, but stripping out the metal moniker altogether would be inaccurate, IMO.

To the point of your question though, I think there's always a little bit of room for interpretation, but it sounds to me like you're kinda changing definitions there. I've never personally seen ""heavy metal"" used as an actual genre aside from just being a synonym for metal in general, and it isn't particularly descriptive as to what it means so I wouldn't personally say that it works very well. 

tl;dr Definitely too many genres; still need some of them; ""heavy metal"" lacks specificity; sounds like dudes you were talking to may be a bit pretentious and you may be trying to reinvent the wheel. Namsayin'?

"[Black Metal] Shadow (3:22), new demo","EDIT: Improved the mix

https://soundcloud.com/brianjleong/shadow-demo-remixed

Finally got in the recording booth for the first time in over a month. Lyrically, I think the opening lines are killer and it begged me to write an entire song, but I found out pretty quick is really damn hard to write a black metal song about your shadow that isn't complete cheese. Lyrics are subject to change at any time.

The riff is an alternating pattern between I and V that's really fun to play. Drums are programmed, and I'm not a drummer, so there's a lot of work needed there.

Things that need to be worked on: The song is in dire need of leads, but I haven't decided what I want to play over the riff. Might go as far as doing a solo but that kind of also takes away from the minimalistic black metal approach I'm going for. 

Also, this is the second song I recorded vocals for today (will finish that one later), so I did it all on one take and didn't bother to go back and smooth things out. The edge makes it a bit more genuine I guess, but it doesn't exactly sound they way I want it to.

All comments appreciated, especially on production, mixing, etc!"
"[Black Metal] Shadow (3:22), new demo","I feel like the guitar is way too quiet on the left channel. Solos definitely have no place in this. I would stick with an atmospheric melody.

"Charging for downloads... Do you do it?","I'm releasing a grind EP (maybe full length?) and a doom album this summer. They are both one man projects. Neither will be playing live or have any professional promotion. I'm just planning on sending copies to lots of download sites, youtubers, and a few dozen jewel case CD's with cheap inlays as free promotional copies to some local music stores, labels, and friend and what not. I'll also stick my bandcamp pages on a bunch of promotional forums/chats and my signatures all around.

I obviously don't intend on making any kind of a career out of my music, but I'm curious as to whether or not I can make even a spare 20 bucks on digital downloads over the course of like a year. What has everyone's history with bandcamp been? Do you charge for your music? Do you play live? Do you have physical copies? Will I not get any traffic at all regardless of if I charge or leave them up for free? I'm curious as to how many hits a bc page can get even with good digital exposure. 

Thanks!"
"Charging for downloads... Do you do it?","Nope.

I run a small DIY label and put my releases up on Bandcamp. The digital version is free whereas obviously the physical one isn't. But with the physical copy you also get the digital one as well as some other extras.

I do have the downloads set up as a ""Pay What You Want"" deal so if they want to throw a pound my way that's great but doesn't bother me either way. Music is meant to be heard by everyone, whether they can afford it or not."
"Charging for downloads... Do you do it?","I think it kind of comes down to your investment in the music.   I've made demos myself using cheap 4-track recorders, and while they capture some of the spirit of the music, it never sounds professional enough to release it as something I would charge for. As such, my band always spends the cash to go to a studio to be recorded by someone who knows what the fuck they're doing.  On top of that, we're proponents of putting together something cool enough that people will want to purchase a physical copy, so we put out releases with cool, quality packaging as well.  When all is said and done, my two-piece has typically invested thousands in our DIY project, and we need to recoup our costs.   We obviously charge for the physical releases, but I think it's ok to ask fans to chip in a few bucks when an EP took you a fair amount of cash to release it.   As of right now, we're only charging for downloads of our latest release, and our previous release is set to ""pay what you want"".   Most people will just download the record free, but some folks will still toss you a few bucks, which is important to keep in mind, because the same thing can occur with releases where you have a minimum download cost.   Say, for example, you've got an album available for download on bandcamp that's set to $6.66 or more.  People that really dig your shit will often round that up to an even $10 to show their appreciation.   I know I've personally done this when downloading stuff from bands I love, because I know that playing and recording music can be very expensive, and I want to do what I can to make sure my favorite bands can still afford to release music!"
"Charging for downloads... Do you do it?","Nope, never have done. If people want to pay, that's cool, but I would never force their hand for a download, especially if it's a bedroom project."
"Charging for downloads... Do you do it?","I charge a simple $1 for a demo download on my bandcamp page. You can listen to all the songs for free, though. My personal motto, if you want the convenience of having it to play whenever you want, $1 is not that much. We don't even have any physical copies of this demo at the moment, but I would certainly charge more than $1. We play live, just no merch yet at this point in time. 

I'm all for free music, but be aware that, as an artist giving away your stuff for free, you are compromising your marketability, as well as the likelihood of a record label picking you up (they won't want to release recordings that have already been released, even if it is only as a free download). It doesn't seem like this is really your intention though, but I thought it worth noting. "
"Charging for downloads... Do you do it?","I always just put all of my music as ""Free/PayWhatYouWant"" on bandcamp, and one of my beliefs as an artists is that I don't think I would ever want to force people to have to buy my music if they wanted to listen to it."
"Charging for downloads... Do you do it?","Because of how easy it has been to pirate music over the years , people have become entitled when it comes to music.

Nobody thinks they should have to pay for music anymore, and it sucks. It's basically become an unalienable right at this point. 

I think it's still a great idea to put some CD's and stuff out at local places, even if they don't sell well. There are always going to be people who still love CD's, and it will make it easier for other local musicians to hear your stuff.

"
"Charging for downloads... Do you do it?","Me and my bandmates play and record purely for fun the last 4 years so take this with a grain of salt but we haven't ever ""forced"" people to pay for our music on Bandcamp. We just set it to ""pay what you want"" and are fine with that. The more people that listen to it the better! If we did have any merch we would probably charge for that and make some beer $$ there off our big fans who would be buying that."
"Charging for downloads... Do you do it?","Yeah i agree with this totally. For our band, so far all the recordings have been done by us so we would feel like we were taking the piss by forcing people to pay for it as it didn't cost us anything to make. Our main goal is to just get as many people listening to us as possible so wouldn't wanna restrict anyone by putting a price tag on it. If people like it enough they may throw a few quid our way and that's great! But we don't expect people to pay £5 for it or anything."

As a lady, you are taking on a genre that is predominantly men. I like that. 

I don't particularly dig the guitar tone you are using. You're also playing to the original tune, which makes me unsure of what you are playing vs the original recording. But you have played accurately enough that maybe I can't tell the differentiate between the original and your cover. 

My biggest gripe is that you posted this same video a month ago. Reddit is full of Tool material, because they are amazing etc. 

I would prefer to see what original material you have, OR, a full cover of Vicarious.

"How to Achieve That Bass Tone","To me, it sounds like it might be a fuzz on a low gain setting, I wouldn't be surprised if that sound came from a guitar pedal, rather than bass. Probably blended with a cleaner channel to keep the clarity and low end too."
"How to Achieve That Bass Tone","Not sure what exactly is going on there, but here's how I'd do it.

When recording bass, it's pretty common to record direct. I'd actually split the signal a few different ways, through multiple DI boxes or amps. The simplest way to do it would be to run a DI at the front of your chain, and record out of that. After that, I'd run whatever OD/fuzz I loved to get my dirty sound, run that into my amp (which is what I use for my tube overdrive) and then record that as well.

Now I've got two different channels of two distinct bass sounds, which, when mixed together, give you that nasty dirt and the clean preciseness you hear in that clip.

Not being an asshole, genuinely want to help your ears hear what my ears hear. I'm not an ""authority"" on mixing by any means, but I know a good one when I hear it (as well as a bad one).

Guitars: Way too tinny. They have absolutely no body. The thin-ness of the tone/EQ also has the additional adverse effect of ""centering"" your stereo-panned guitars, reducing their width and power. Fight the temptation to give them more ""bite"" to ""stand out"" more. Trust me, a well-rounded tone will stand out on its own. Also, 1:53 - 2:05 is a pretty big performance issue. Out-of-time sweeps were highly noticeable and distracting. Re-record or re-write to the guitarist's actual ability.

Drums: Clearly MIDI. Aside from that, the kicks have a rough time standing out. They *might* need more click, BUT the main issue likely stems from the problem of your guitar tone: the guitars are invading the top-end space where the ""click"" of your drum hits and even some of your cymbals are supposed to sit. They are also very ""dry"". Like, they lack any sense of space. A light reverb send could assist here.

Guitars- I get the feeling I know what you're talking about. I'll run down what I'm doing. I've got 2 tracks panned left and right. Each with a TSE808, LeCab Legion, LeBad 2 with catharsis impulses, and then a highpass-lowpass filter. Then on the master track I've got multiband dynamics, a compressor, and a limiter. I'm not sure what else I need to do in order to flesh out the tone. Here's a picture of my [settings](http://i.imgur.com/9gayCGe.png)

The bass and drums I'm less worried about atm, though I'm aware they need more work. I really want to nail down the guitars before I focus on the rest."
"Still learning to mix/master. Here is a current work in progress and I'd love to get some feedback. Thanks in advance.","I suppose I can't speak for the quality of the LeCab plugin or related impulses since I've never tried them. I'm a bit worried that you scooped the mids in your EQ, however. That's pretty much where you want guitars to dominate. I typically try and scoop out a bit of the harsher, tinny high-mids with a slight peak on either end of the scoop to get a bit of the edge back. It creates the illusion of having that high-end bite still there, but without all the harsher frequencies muddying the top end.

On top of this, you might be slamming your multi-band compressor and/or limiter too hard, which can further exaggerate frequencies you boosted or left behind. Less is more imo.

And here's a little snippet of what it sounds like with everything in the mix: https://soundcloud.com/sean-golyer/test

All of it is subjective of course, there's no ""right"" way to do it. It all comes down to what YOU want hear and what is pleasing to your ears. Try and compare your mix at the same volume level side-by-side another professional mix that you admire in a similar genre/style and try and pick out the differences and figure out what ways you can make yours sound better/more professional."

"I want to start recording a demo project. Where do I start?","Hello /r/metalmusicians! I'm a metal bassist and composer in need of advice.

So, I have written a couple of metal songs in Guitar Pro and I have ideas for a few more. I thought it would be cool to actually record these songs into a demo project, mostly for fun and to learn new things. Where should I start and what would be the best methods for doing it? I would prefer not to buy any new gear, or at least spend as little money as possible. Consider the following things:

First of all the quality of my equipment isn't too great. Squier Affinity series P-bass and a 20-watt Harley Benton amp are what I use for playing bass. I can play guitar aswell, but I don't own one so I could either borrow my friend's gear or get him to record the guitar parts. I don't own drums nor can I actually play them.

Also what comes to recording equipment, I have no idea what is actually required to record a somewhat listenable demo. Ages ago I bought a USB-interface, Miditech Guitarface II. Is that good for anything at all? 

If you guys figure out how to actually plug the instruments to my computer (which should have a decent soundcard btw), what kind of software do I need for recording, mixing, mastering etc? Since I don't have any real drums I might have to use a drum machine or something, right? Guess there's software for that too?

That's pretty much everything I guess. Hopefully you can point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance and ask if I forgot to mention anything!"
"I want to start recording a demo project. Where do I start?","Its gonna be pretty hard to record a demo with out buying any equipment but it a definitely possible, you'll need a DAW (digital audio workstation) anything from audacity to pro tools will work for you I'd recommend reaper.  For recording you'll use the interface so you won't have to buy any mics you'll need amp Sims for the guitars and bass.  For drums you'll need a program like ezdrummer or something similar.  For vocals you will have to invest in a decent microphone and interface to properly record that.  Most of these things you can get for free or on free trial for aome like reaper the full version will be around 50$ or so if you want some thing more ramped up it will cost more.  Lastly you could rey some live recording just get some friends who play instruments and jam with a live recording device or even record into a 8 track or something old school. "
"I want to start recording a demo project. Where do I start?","Okay, thanks for the reply! So let's say I'm going to get Reaper, how exactly should I setup my gear to get the best possible quality and as little latency as possible? Should the interface go to my amp's headphones jack, and headphones/speakers to the interface's output? Also, what about these ""amp sims"", do they come with reaper or do I need to set them up somehow?"
"I want to start recording a demo project. Where do I start?","Good advice above, get Reaper and start recording your project there.

If what you've written is good, you can easily find people on reddit or other sites to throw in the other parts. If you're a bassist, stick to playing bass and find a guitarist/drummer/vocalist to finish it out."
"I want to start recording a demo project. Where do I start?","You're on the right track for a basic recording setup. A full home studio isn't needed for just laying some ideas down. This is my setup for recording in my room:

* Peavy VIP-3 amp with USB interface (like what you have)
* Desktop computer: quad core 2.6ghz processor, 8gb ram, on-board sound card (PCI cards are great too)
* Ableton Live 8.1 for recording and adding drums/orchestral tracks
* Boss NS-2 noise suppressor pedal (my room has a ton of electromagnetic interference, bad power wiring)

You do not need a software suite like Ableton to record though. I started with Audacity and it worked quite well. I switched to Ableton because it comes with a plethora of instruments that I am still learning how to work in to my music. [Beatcraft](http://www.acoustica.com/beatcraft/) served me well, but I got tired of having to export drum tracks and import them into whatever I'm recording my guitar with.

Side note on your USB interface: You could very possibly encounter some ferocious hardware latency when recording. This becomes a big problem when your guitar tracks sound off-tempo because of the latency. I installed [ASIO4ALL](http://www.asio4all.com/) and now have MUCH less latency compared to MME/DirectX. Make sure to calibrate your software for hardware latency (Ableton has a built in guide) - I can elaborate if you need any help.

Edit: [This](https://soundcloud.com/originalname/low-and-slow-bbm) is an example of the drums and orchestral instruments in Ableton being used a song idea I recently recorded. Might be a little loud, just a heads up."

"I feel I've learned a lot over the course of my writing, I hope this list helps other composers here!","I liked this. I had a comment about #4. I agree with you that it's more about how you play and less about the gear. But don't forget it's also about how your gear is set up and how you get the tone you do. Those are just as important. Because some people can get great tones from shit, and some people have no concept of tone with great equipment. So tone can be just important as skill. "
"I feel I've learned a lot over the course of my writing, I hope this list helps other composers here!","Hey thanks for reading. Yeah I know what you mean, the gear sure is important. It's just that I've seen a lot of people recently posting about how they could never get such good tones and stuff without spending lots of money on the equipment that their favourite guitarists have. I agree with you though that if you know what you're doing, you can get a good tone out of pretty much anything. "

"[GEAR]Sunn SL260 combo into 1980 Sunn 4x12. The 3/4 doom stack.","2x12 solid state combo pushing 60 watts. It drives the 4x12 with plenty of power and is a two channel clean tone machine that loves to eat fuzz pedals. Enough volume on tap to get you wasted. 

It has a mid boost frequency knob that actually eqs the sound. Bright switch is bright and the reverb is DEEP. Local craigslist score and I can't wait to ABY it with another more traditional stack."
"[GEAR]Sunn SL260 combo into 1980 Sunn 4x12. The 3/4 doom stack.","Nice find!  Because of the whole 60 watt thing you might find you need to push this pretty hard if you're putting it next to a 100 watt stack, but I bet it will sound killer.  Multiple amp combinations work wonders when nailing down meaty doom tones.  "
"[GEAR]Sunn SL260 combo into 1980 Sunn 4x12. The 3/4 doom stack.","Indeed it does need to get pushed to match a 100w stack but luckily it can take it. I've been finding all sorts of great tones with it already. I've got a buddy with a rig we're going to ABY test it with to see just how loud it can go."
"[GEAR]Sunn SL260 combo into 1980 Sunn 4x12. The 3/4 doom stack.","What are you tuning to?  If it's low enough, you might check out running a rig through a bass cab with it, or even running a full bass rig.  I play a baritone tuned A to A most of the time, and I run a Sunn 1200s through an 8x10 along with a Laney GH100ti through a full stack, and the sound is a total doom crusher.  I also have a Peavey XXX that I run through a 2x15, and that sounds amazing paired with the full stack as well.  If you have the cabs around, a lot of guitar heads sound great through bass cabs for doom.  I know having a ton of gear lying around is not feasible in many cases, but if you live in a larger city you can score plenty of serviceable cabs off craigslist without breaking the bank."
"[GEAR]Sunn SL260 combo into 1980 Sunn 4x12. The 3/4 doom stack.","I play an SG tuned to A. I had a 74 red knob model t but traded it for drums. I'm slowly working on getting a multi amp rig again. There's a sovtek mig 50 on my local craigslist for a fair price. I may scoop it up. I live in Seattle so there's no short of gear for sale haha."

"Any tips for staying perfectly in time while playing?Any instrument","Get a metronome."
"Any tips for staying perfectly in time while playing?Any instrument","**And always use it.** It's very rare for me to not have a metronome going when I play. Sometimes I shut it of when writing stuff so it isn't distracting, but when I practice it is on 100% of the time."
"Any tips for staying perfectly in time while playing?Any instrument","Practice to a metronome and count out loud. Counting out loud may make you feel incredibly stupid at first, but whatever you do, **don't skip over it**. Trust me, I've probably spent enough time on the drums counting the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 more times than I ever counted them in school. My drum teacher hated when I didn't count out loud. He'd make me redo it, and usually I did much better when I sucked it up and said them out loud. Every second of every minute of every hour of every day you spend committing yourself to improving will benefit you for the rest of your life. It's only stupid if it's a waste of your time."
"Any tips for staying perfectly in time while playing?Any instrument","Practicing daily to a metronome is obvious.

The less obvious one is practice at slow tempos as well.  Being a metal subreddit you're likely to want to play all fast.  Your riffs sound better at the proper tempo if you've also spent time playing them at slow tempos.  Especially if you're tremolo picking a lot.  How is it even going to sound good playing 32nd notes if you can't even tremolo pick quarters or eighths steadily."
"Any tips for staying perfectly in time while playing?Any instrument","When I play I'm always moving a part of my body along with the tempo. Usually I tap my heel or headbang."
"Any tips for staying perfectly in time while playing?Any instrument","Obviously practice, practice, practice. Start with a metronome at a slow speed and then increase when you're feeling comfortable. 

As for guitar playing I personally just write songs,  program some drums for it,  then play along all the time and increase BPMs accordingly. Metronome is too big of a hazzle for me because I play different riffs at different tempos.

"New demo track I wrote, Deus est Mortuus. Tell me what you think! [Experimental Metal]","Virtual setups do not provide the ""best tones"". However, they do provide pretty good tones for the money and are great writing tools for startups such as yourself. The best tones will always come from a good player + a good guitar + a good amp/cab + a good room + a good mic(s) + a good pre-amp + a good AD/DA converter + a good engineer."
"New demo track I wrote, Deus est Mortuus. Tell me what you think!

Original Lyrics:

J'ai toujours vécu ici pourtant
Tel un étranger errant
Sur cette terre, esseulé,
En perpétuel détachment,

J'entends en moi l'appel d'un autre univers
Qui résonne amèrement.

Les yeux rivés vers le ciel,
Portant le fardeau de mon corps,
Je perçois ma demeure
Perdue dans les nuées.

Trop de pesanteur ici, de bras obstinés
Retenant les esprits voyageurs
Sur le point de s'échapper.

D'ici bas je perçois ma demeure,
Ses prairies éternelles, perdues dans les nuées.

Là où naissent les couleurs nouvelles,
Là où mon coeur et mon âme sont restés.

English Translation:

From Which New Colors Rise

So long I've lived here, but still it seems
So Foreign, just a tourist errant
On this Earth, an essence
In perpetual detatchment

I can hear my calling
From another universe
How it resonates
Through the bitter cold

I fix my vision, toward the sky
Projecting, all these burdens of mine
I can see my home
In pursuit of the clouds

Too much weight hangs,
From these brazen arms
Restraining the spirit of voyage
On the verge of escape

From this place, I can see my home
The praries eternally in pursuit of the clouds

Where they rise, new colors from the gray
Where my heart, and this soul of mine will stay"

"Tips for writing good death metal riffs?","I've been dicking around a lot on my guitar lately, and I kinda want to start jamming out with riffs. The only problem is that I don't really know how. I've come up with one thing so far, but I later realized that it's more or less a ripoff of the intro to Opening of the Gates by Morbid Angel. Any tips for coming up with memorable and solid riffs?"
"Tips for writing good death metal riffs?","I dunno, you just... do. When you listen and play long enough you just become accustomed to what makes a tune good or not. I mean understanding scales and modulation helps but for the most part just getting good at jamming out rhythms and riffs and stuff is how it's done."
"Tips for writing good death metal riffs?","Yeah, unfortunately there isn't really a science to it.

I got into music and writing music because I""m a programmer by trade and I find art bizarrely foreign.  I've learned you just kind of roll with it and see.  I write a lot using TuxGuitar too -- it helps to create entire melodies/harmonies/etc.  Don't have much music theory background, so I'm almost entirely by ear/feel.

Also, just because the riff is a rip off doesn't mean it's unusable.  It's basically what most bands do now anyway. :-P"
"Tips for writing good death metal riffs?","Your last point - it's what musicians have done since the dawn of music."
"Tips for writing good death metal riffs?","Riffs are not always intended to be melodic, but the same concepts that work for melody writing can be effectively applied to riff writing.

Effective melodies are usually derived from very simple ideas that are repeated, either literally or with some sort of variation, and mixed with contrasting material into phrases with one of several forms: AAAB, ABAB, or ABAC. There are other possibilities of course, but that's usually what it boils down to. AAAB, for example, would be three repetitions of an idea (either literally or with small variations) and then something different. Often, phrases are arranged in such away that one phrase creates a ""question"" that is ""answered"" by the next phrase, but a lot of bands just dispense with that and have a lot of ABs in succession that don't vary or answer each other. 

Now take those principles and apply them to some of the standard tropes of death metal--dropped tunings (as /u/et5150's link pointed out, drop-C is very effective, but a lot of modern death metal is written using very heavy strings in drop-A), diminished and chromatic scales, palm muting, tremolo picking, and pinch harmonics--and you're in riff city. 

A lot of death metal bands abstract from this foundation considerably, but it's almost always in there somewhere. To get a better sense of the various tropes and idioms that death metal musicians employ, take some of your favorite riffs, write them out in whatever notational system you prefer, and analyze them, breaking them down, looking for repetition and variation, uncovering the underlying structures and patterns that makes the music work. 

It may seem like a really heady, intellectual approach to a very primal and intuitive genre of music, but keep in mind that very few death metal musicians, or musicians in any genre, write melodies or riffs by sitting down and saying, ""Okay, here's the first idea, and that's 'A', and now I'm going to repeat that three times, and then here's another idea, and thats 'B'..."" What this process does is strengthen your musical intuition so you can write good riffs naturally and intuitively. "
"Tips for writing good death metal riffs?","You should try to learn the songs you like. I might push you to copy too much in the beginning (like you said with MA), but it's a good way to learn how riffs are made and start making your own. Would be better to learn from many different bands, so your playing will be a mix and not a copy."
"Tips for writing good death metal riffs?","There is no formula or magic scale, but I've found that one thing that helps me to spice up generic riffs and to get ourside the confines of my habitual box is to input the riff into guitar pro and to start screwing around with the timing to make it more unique. This is something I'm not always that great at instinctively so it's been a great help with breaking up the monotony of some songs or testing out things I can't get up to speed yet. "
"Tips for writing good death metal riffs?","This might sound weird, but, listen to music backwards and try to play along. I have a looper pedal that will play a loop in reverse, so I learn a riff I like, then reverse it, and try to play it backwards.

You can get some good ideas that way."
"Tips for writing good death metal riffs?","Trying writing it on a computer or in your head first and then playing it. That way you don't accidentally write what your fingers already know."
"Tips for writing good death metal riffs?","There are two ways to go about it, and I think its a matter of how comfortable you are with it. 

There is the [Ron Jarzombek](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5SCH0Umbs) way. 

And there is the [modern / guitarpro](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2013/02/08/exclusive-guitar-pro-tablature-software-revealed-as-original-the-haarp-machine-member/) way to do it. 

The second way is a easier, but first way will get you better results in my opinion. "

"Questions about bass amp choices","I'm looking to buy my first bass amp for gigging with metal. My question is, does it really have to be a head and cab separately, or is it reasonable to look at combos? My issue is purely based on budgetary restrictions. (Also, would this question be answered different for guitar amps instead of basses?)

It just seems to me that in bars and small places, when I see people perform with giant amps, it looks like a bit of overkill. And even in larger venues, once the amp is mic'd, how important does it need to be super super blasting?

Believe me, I'm a total beginner when it comes to gear, so please set me straight. But should I be looking for a specific wattage, combo or not?"
"Questions about bass amp choices","In my experience(I play bass, used to tour off and on) it all comes down to personal preference. Some people are all about full amps while others prefer combos. I use a huge 8x10 cab and full rack. Most of the time when I get set up the sound guy just runs an XLR cable to my SansAmp or to my head, basically negating the entire need for a cabinet. There were shows I played where I didn't/couldn't load in my rig so everything was ran through my SansAmp. "
"Questions about bass amp choices","Ah, fair enough. But then that would mean a combo amp should definitely have an XLR out, right?"
"Questions about bass amp choices","Yes. Depending on brand most I believe have an XLR out. A combo amp should do you fine. I mainly got a huge rig because the scene I came up in guitars and bass were never mic'ed(due to a small PA usually because the shows were held in VFW Halls or people's basements) so you had to have something loud enough to be heard. Some clubs when you show up with a huge rig the sound guy will tell you to not even bother loading it onto stage because he's going to run you direct. "
"Questions about bass amp choices","My line of thinking is that you should pick up a combo first - this will mean you can play at any venue (bars and small places will not always have a backline, sometimes you'll just be playing in the corner). The next thing to buy will be a versatile head, which will mean venues that have a backline including a bass cab are now a breeze, you just need to bring your head and plug in. You can also arrange gear share with other bands sometimes, who may be willing to let you use their bass cab.

Next step (I'm not there yet) is to get a cab to go with your head, or upgrade your combo. Now you've got all your bases covered!"
"Questions about bass amp choices","Gallien-Krueger has a series of combos (MBxxx-II Ultralight) that are super loud with awesome tone, plus XLR out and the option for an extension cab (either powered or not). The 1x15 is only two or three hundred watts and is really quiet, but I got the 210 version and I've been thrilled with it so far. It can hold its own against two Marshall half stacks with plenty of headroom left, AND it weighs less than my Marshall head!
(I'm a long-time guitarist and drummer who recently started playing bass in a gigging thrash band.)"
"Questions about bass amp choices","Check out the Acoustic B200 and see if that will meet your needs. Economical and performs well. If they laugh and give you guff just pick up a 4X10 cab and connect it. But, you are right, overkill seems to be the rule of the day."
"Questions about bass amp choices","This amp seems like a very very reasonable choice."
"Questions about bass amp choices","I've been playing bass in and out of  bands for 11 years now, and you really need to ask how powerful are your guitarist's amps? How far are you looking to go with this? Professional? Just for fun? To me personally the most important thing is can I hear myself? Then after that it's getting the right sound. "

"What does your band logo look like?

"What does your band logo look like? I'm having trouble with mine, got some ideas, would love feedback.","Yes, yours works very well. I think the big problem I'm having is that we sound like [this](https://soundcloud.com/lucifers-stepdad/sets/lucifers-stepdad-ep) and that's halfway between readable logo and just looking like some sticks. Mild identity crisis."
"What does your band logo look like? I'm having trouble with mine, got some ideas, would love feedback.","Well, think about it. Does your band to you sound like ""a bunch of sticks"" to you? Or is it more streamlined like a 1970's Plymouth Barracuda with a Pentastar engine? Is it egregiously messy? Is it slender and vile? Is it edgy and sharp, curvy and voluptuous, quaint and unconfident? That should help you decide what sort of logo to make."

EDIT: or do you guys think a [busier drum beat](https://soundcloud.com/tony15339/demosong09withdrumsalt) would be better?"
"Are my programmed drums too bland to continue with!?","For me, Animals As Leaders' debut album proves that if you put enough effort into them, programmed drums don't have to hold you back."
"Are my programmed drums too bland to continue with!?","those are awful

put the snare on the 2 and 4, or on the 3

cymbals go steady on quarter notes

take the toms out"
"Are my programmed drums too bland to continue with!?","Maybe should have mentioned this is sort of an ""intro"" into the song but either way I guess ill try that, also I'm a guitarist of 8 years but a drummer of none so it's difficult for me to understand how drumming works sometimes, though I understand the basics are keep the ""structure""; a constant rhythm haha."
"Are my programmed drums too bland to continue with!?","The riff is pretty cool, but you aren't accenting the feel of it with the drum part. You want to make it groovy. A good place to start is a strong accent on the first beat of every measure, with a kick and a crash. 

For that particular part I'd probably do two eighth notes on the kick to start so it would sound like bum bum badaba badaba bum bum badaba badaba. Putting a snare over the kick on the first beat of the second measure would give it a good balance, so it would be like

bum bum badaba badaba CRACK bum badaba badaba

and the crash could just ride on the quarter notes

hope that makes sense

"Are my programmed drums too bland to continue with!?","drums don't sound like theyre following anything. Drums are suppossed to act like a metronome. I understand if you want to have fills and what not, but those cant just be random. 

I suggest start off simple, like bass-snare-cymbal, and then work your way towards complex drum patterns.

Also, pretend that the programed drums is human. Would a human be able to play your drum track without being confused?"

"So I made a guitar play through of my newest song's main solo. Any tips on improving it would be nice!","Thanks for the criticism! The tuning issue you hear is my guitar's intonation not being right for drop B tuning. I'm working on getting it fixed but I don't have any money currently lol"
"So I made a guitar play through of my newest song's main solo. Any tips on improving it would be nice!","*Warning: I'm going to sound like a dickhead and deconstruct a lot of something that I'm sure you put some good hours into creating. But it might help you become better at what you obviously love doing.  
For the record, I have virtually zero social life and spend most of my free time absorbed in learning about music.  
There will be some heavy theory stuff here. If you don't know what the terms mean, look them up—you'll be better off as a writer if you do. Remember, music theory is not a pretentious set of rules that you* must *follow, but merely an exhaustive set of pretty damn good suggestions and guidelines for writing music that pleases you, the composer, as well as has potential to captivate an audience. Also remember that it often boils down to ambiguous subjectivity.* On with it:



**technique**  
–work on your timing. work on your timing. *work on your timing.* If you're gonna sit around and noodle and wank and jam by yourself without playing along to a song you're learning, **use a metronome.**  
–[develop consistent vibrato on sustained notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L68rxhMq6Kw)  
–develop muting technique (muting the strings not currently played), and tie a sock or stick a terry cloth wristband around the neck lower on the fretboard for recording super-clean lead passages.

**composition**  

–seems like you've got a pretty good grasp on scales, but some parts jump out as completely non-musical. See:

1. the sweep-diddly at 1:53 (that just might be a technical biff, or else an attempt at Kerry King-esque superfast atonality). Always ask yourself, ""Does this actually call for [slick part you came up with]?"" Yeah, sweeping and heroics are cool, but not always necessary. There's jarring (""holy fuck that transition was cool, he really changed it up there""), and then there's *jarring* (""that part didn't really make sense""). Consider that there's a time and place for everything, and it might not be here.  
2. the C-natural at 2:01—it's squawking out of key. I understand that you might be trying to achieve intentional dissonance, but this is not coming out as the ""good kind"" and really betrays an amateur status (not that I'm some fucking pro, 'cause I'm not). You're in B minor, and you've previously established the supertonic (2nd scale degree) as being C#, so if you're going to stick in a dissonant supertonic there, you might consider using the already established C#, figuring out a way of modulating into B Phrygian somewhere before this point and keeping the C-natural, or instead aiming for consonance using the mediant (3rd degree), dominant (5th) or leading tone/subtonic (7th). 
3. Try writing a solo that has some sort of form/pattern instead of one that's through-composed. One big, long solo that takes you around the world can too easily call to mind [this kind of nonsense.](http://youtu.be/qOFgKy_CDX4?t=2m10s)

**instrument**  
–you've obviously been playing for some time, so I know you know how to tune your instrument, but (in my observation) even some experienced guitarists are completely unaware of the concept of intonation. I think your guitar needs an intonation fix, since a lot of your sustained notes are ringing out as in-key, but noticeably flat or sharp. You can take it to a music shop and pay to have some never-was rockstar turd with a lip piercing do it, or [do it on your own, it's very easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1ZM9IGnIcY) (it's difficult for me to see your bridge, but I think I got it right). Either that, or you're fretting too hard (in which case, be careful with frethand pressure, and get some heavier strings if you're not already using a very thick gauge."
"So I made a guitar play through of my newest song's main solo. Any tips on improving it would be nice!","If i could upvote this more I would. I really do appreciate someone taking the time to deconstruct my material and tell me what needs to be fixed and what I am doing correctly. I do want to address a few things though. 
I do know the intonation on my guitar is set for drop C tuning so the notes being noticeably sharp or flat is due to the fact that I'm in drop B and I haaaaaaate staying in just one tuning because I feel like it limits what I can do. I'm trying to get a 7 string for that reason and maybe another 6 string so I can keep one guitar at a set tuning and not have to worry about my intonation being screwed up. But for now all I have is 1 guitar, one bass, and freeware recording equipment. 
I like the fact that you point out some of the non-musical things that I put in there because I had intentionally put them there to kinda add to the song because I intended for that to be the climax of the song. But this was my 3rd attempt at trying to write a song that didn't need lyrics to it (If you listen to most of the songs on my channel you will notice that they do need lyrics but I don't do any vocals because I sound like a dying cat) so while I might have 7 years of playing guitar under my belt, I only have about a year of writing material by myself and not with a full band. 
And for the super clean lead tones, I don't really believe in putting a sock or a wristband around the neck. I guess it's just a pet peeve of mine but I'd much rather attempt to get the best possible lead I can without the use of anything extra.
Again, I thank you for the criticism and I will definitely keep in mind everything you pointed out. If you would, I would love for you to watch for my posts and do this same thing again because I really do strive to be as good as I can be with my craft and people like you surely do help! "
"So I made a guitar play through of my newest song's main solo. Any tips on improving it would be nice!","I'm a lot more into thrash, stoner and death metal than the style you play, but here goes;

* The shred parts seemed a little out of place, I think some kind of transitional lick from the preceding parts would help
* The non-shred parts might go on for a bit too long, or could do with slightly more variation 

Other than that, I thought it was a decent composition. Maybe tighten up your timing on the shred parts like the other commenter said "
"So I made a guitar play through of my newest song's main solo. Any tips on improving it would be nice!","&gt; The non-shred parts might go on for a bit too long, or could do with slightly more variation

This is what I'd say. 1:07 to 1:16 could have ended at 1:09"
"So I made a guitar play through of my newest song's main solo. Any tips on improving it would be nice!","You lose timing at the 1:00 mark. Big time. In fact, whenever you play really fast, you have terrible timing. So, hone your timing skills. "
"So I made a guitar play through of my newest song's main solo. Any tips on improving it would be nice!","I appreciate the criticism! Although besides the opening fast lick I can't exactly hear anywhere else where I'm noticeably out of time. If you could point out another instance so I know what you are talking about that would be much appreciated :)"
"So I made a guitar play through of my newest song's main solo. Any tips on improving it would be nice!","**timbre**  
the lead guitar tone you're using may not be appropriate. Try nudging down your gain and/or lows slightly. Or drastically! The more gain you have, the more soft-clip compression you introduce to the pre-amp and amp stage within the vacuum tubes. This would be hard-clip on a solid state transistor amp (Dimebag-esque tone). The more lows you have, the more speaker cone compression you introduce. These principles apply as well to simulators (Guitar Rig, *etc*), since they intentionally attempt to emulate the behavior of real amplifiers. 

Anyway, it's relevant because the more compression you have (of either type), the more your picking articulation turns to mush, especially with fast passages and ESPECIALLY with palm muting. There's a very fast ""breathing/pumping"" effect that you'll learn to identify, and this effect can really easily fool the listener into perceiving your playing as being out of time, even if you're butthole-tight."
"So I made a guitar play through of my newest song's main solo. Any tips on improving it would be nice!","Oh okay! I will definitely look more into that. Thanks!"

"Good and cheapish recording setup?","What's the best deal for a mic/guitar recording setup? Pod, cables, and recording mic? 
(Alternatively, any mic that's versatile enough for screaming, cleans, voice acting, and just talking? Or would any USB microphone do?)"
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","Recording gear is one of those things you really don't want to skimp on. Cheap gear can be unreliable and break down easily, especially if you're new to home recording. That said, there are quite a few options which are cheaper and reliable.

Microphone: to start, I really recommend using an XLR (standard mic cable connection) and interface setup rather than going with a USB mic. It allows you to swap gear for future purchases and often provides more reliable options. For most home recording setups, you cant go wrong with Shure brand mics. They're durable, relatively cheap, and used in studios and live sound setups across the country. For all around instrument use, use the SM57. For vocals, the SM58 is generally better (though a 57 can be used in a pinch). These two mics are industry standard, by which I mean you will probably find at least 4 of each in every good studio across the globe. For about $100 a piece you can't really go wrong.

Interface: this is another component in which you are bombarded with a lot of choices. What you'll likely want is an interface with two inputs which can handle both XLR and 1/4 inch TRS (tip ring sleeve) or TS (tip sleeve) connections. This allows you to use both standard XLR microphones as well as direct input from guitar amps and other instruments. If possible, get phantom power/48 volt compatibility switches on both channels. Phantom power allows you to use condensor mics which require 48 volt power to travel back into the microphone. To be fair, you wont need this for either of the microphones I listed above as both the SM57 and 58 are dynamic mics which don't require power. Still, having phantom power allows you to use other condensor mics of potentially higher quality in the future if you want to upgrade.

For model recommendations, the Avid MBox and Focusrite Scarlett (2i2) series are both great options. These are the options I'm most familiar with and comfortable recommending so don't feel confined. In most cases, do some research on the features and stick to name brands and you should be fine.

DAW recording software: (DAW stands for digital audio workspace.) Many times software will be included with your interface purchase. Avid, the makers of the MBox interface, also produce ProTools, one of the industry's most powerful recording softwares, so a lite version is sometimes included with your purchase. For newer users though really high powered software, such as ProTools and Logic, are not always ideal as they come with a learning curve. I know a couple people who use GarageBand and still come out with great recordings. Remember that your interface only allows you to play with what's already recorded. If you're having trouble, try manipulating the setup first. It's a lot harder to mix out bad recording artifacts than it is to move your microphone placement 2 inches. GarageBand and Reaper are both cheap and competent enough to get you by in most cases. If none of these suits your fancy, you can also try Ableton or Cubase.

Hope that's enough to get you started. As always, dig in with some research and don't be afraid to ask questions. Newbies are likely to get laughed at a couple times but it just comes with the trade. Don't feel bad for wanting to learn and always be looking for more information.

GOOD LUCK!"
"Good and cheapish recording setup?"," Thanks man!  I don't even know how to respond to all this information! 

Are dynamic mics also good for speaking purposes? And are there small enough stands that will allow you to use them while sitting, less than a foot from you? "
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","I'd avoid a USB mic, but a shure PG58 is what I use and that more than gets the job done."
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","You use any pod then? O.o"
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","You mean a preamp? yes but I don't know as much about them. I have an M-audio mobile-pre which gets the job done for home projects but I think the driver software is a little glitchy. It also came with a cleaned up version of Pro Tools that I hate vividly. It's extremely clunky and a resource hog and also glitches the fuck up on my either year old computer AND on my four month old gaming rig. I'll never understand why it's considered a standard."
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","Wow. Maybe we should all switch to Ableton. XD"
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","Focus rite makes inexpensive, reliable MIDI interfaces, like the Scarlett 2i2 and 2i4. I use the latter with a direct box for guitar and Logic Pro so I can build virtual walls of amplifiers. I have a cheap audiotechnica condenser mic for vocals, but listen to others' microphone recommendations on the score.  With the direct box you're looking at a normal quarter inch guitar cable and an XLR cable."
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","How much are they? The interface? "
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","A common recommendation that gets thrown out around here is the Line 6 UX1, because it comes with the Pod Farm 2 modeling software. I use it, and despite having a now-defective unit it, it's a great little box for $150."
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","What makes it defective? "
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","I think the headphone jack came loose so I only get R and L output at certain spots on the knob. Too lazy to open and re-solder."
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","Oh!  I misread this. I thought you were saying that the unit itself when you purchase it is defective. My bad. "
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","The 2i2 goes for about $150, the 2i4 is a tad more, I think 180 or 190."
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","I'm looking at the 2i2 and it looks pretty good.   :)

I'll be getting a Shure SM58 in like a week or two. Think that'll be alright for recording? "
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","Depending on what you want to use it for that should do fine. Both are high quality products that should hold up and allow you to do quite a bit. Remember, SM58 is great for vocals but the SM57 is the standard for instruments. If at all possible, I'd say get both. For a cheapish setup though having either is definitely great though."
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","Cool. I don't think you hear of these mics used for podcasting often though? I plan on using mics for multiple purposes. Voice acting, live vocals, recording screaming/cleans. And I'll be using the interface for guitar work. Will the midi stuff work for the guitars or should I just try to get amplitube or guitarrig stuff? "
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","You're right, the SM58 is generally not used for voice acting stuff. Most voice acting projects I've seen use large diaphragm condenser mics. The main reason for this, as I understand it, is that a condenser mic's inherent power gives it a little farther pickup range. This means that your source's (your mouth) proximity to the microphone won't necessarily affect the volume as much. Using the SM58 is probably fine for your purposes, but you'll likely have to get right up next to it to get the input level you'll want on your vocals.

For live singing vocals as well as musical studio recordings you shouldn't have any problems as singing often occurs at higher volumes (unless you're [Loud Howard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyCWOgu42w)).

If you're planning on using an in the box plugin for guitars then either interface should work fine. Just remember that your input volume will likely be significantly lower if you jack in straight from your guitar. Try switching between line level and mic level on the interface if you're not getting the volume you need."
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","I see. That makes sense. I think I'll probably just upgrade to that when I can for it.   :)

And okay, is it normally that quiet? And XLR are just regular cables, right? "
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","[XLR are balanced cables you'll use for your microphone](http://homerecording.about.com/od/homestudiobasics/g/Balanced_cable.htm) they have a male and female end, the female end has three holes and the male end is sheathed and has three prongs.  The microphone takes the female end and the interface will take the male end.  The Scarlett uses the same input jack for the XLR and the 1/4"" guitar cable.  For my setup, I have a guitar with a 1/4"" guitar cable (what i think you're calling a 'regular' cable) go to a direct box which them goes to an XLR into the MIDI interface.  My microphone goes through an XLR into the MIDI interface.  "
"Good and cheapish recording setup?","Okay, cool. Sorry, these probably seem like simple questions.   &gt;…&lt;"

"Opeth 'Moonlapse Vertigo' Guitar Cover",""
"Opeth 'Moonlapse Vertigo' Guitar Cover","Great effort! What tuning is this in?"
"Opeth 'Moonlapse Vertigo' Guitar Cover","It's E standard."
"Opeth 'Moonlapse Vertigo' Guitar Cover","It's not bad man. The acoustic section for the first and second verse is way off though? I'm not sure if you're doing that for effect, but it sounds like you're an entire 8th note off all the way through. There's an easier way to play that little Bb shape at the end of the verse phrase, too:

    e|------------------------------------------------------------------|
    B|----------------------------------------------------------3-------|
    G|-------------0---------------0---------------0--------2/3---0-2h3-|
    D|-----4-----4---4-----4-----4---4-----4-----4--------0-------------|
    A|---2-----2---------2-----2---------2-----2------1-----------------|
    E|-0-----3---------0-----3---------0-----3--------------------------|


This way you can stay in the same position for the whole thing. On the last rep before the chorus kicks in, instead of sliding down to 1st fret, slide that last shape up to 6th fret low E string and hammer on the chord:

    D|-7-|
    A|-5-|
    E|-6-|


It sounds like you are missing some stuff here and there (some chords, phrasing, etc.) Did you learn it by ear or via tab? That acoustic section right before the solo is good though. That's a weird 15/16 phrase isn't it? Solo was pretty good too (a tad out of tune.)

I think it may be better if you turned down the volume of the actual track a bit and your guitar up a bit (not much, maybe +2dB)"
"Opeth 'Moonlapse Vertigo' Guitar Cover","One big mistake I can clearly account for is when I went into the strumming pattern. I knew I fucked up a bit going into it, but by that point I got kind of tired hearing the song for the millionth time, so I just decided to keep it as it is. I probably should've put 'For entertainment purposes only' being that it's not entirely 100% accurate. Then again, mistakes are a part of life, I use my channel mostly as motivation to get better, as well as really develop a feeling when it comes to song structure, composition etc. As for the first acoustic interlude, I'm not entirely sure who's correct, being that Everytime I heard It I swore that what I was hearing was relevant to what I was playing. By the way, do you have a Youtube channel? I'D definitely be interested in seeing some of your videos if you do. "
"Opeth 'Moonlapse Vertigo' Guitar Cover","Needless to say, judging by your profile (pardon my trolling), you seem like an intelligent dude who I could learn a lot from. I, myself, need to delve into more theory, as well as Audio Engineering. I absolutely love the organic approach, but theres always more to learn."
"Opeth 'Moonlapse Vertigo' Guitar Cover","I hear ya. Recording music can be tiring. Usually when I record a song, I have to put it away for a week before I can listen to it at all. Just get so sick of it from practicing it then recording it.

I don't mean the acoustic interlude, I mean the part where he sings ""Kept warm, by the light of the lantern,..."" etc. The verses. If you look at the first verse, your picking is almost an entire 8th note out. The second verse is a bit better but still out. By the time it gets to the verse riff before the interlude kicks in, it seems to be OK. Rhythm wise it is OK, it almost just looks like you accidentally offset the audio/video clip for the verses too far forward.

Don't have a YouTube account, no, sorry. I've thought about making one but have never gotten around to it. I have a few things up on SoundCloud if you want to check it out: https://soundcloud.com/GSGuitar -- There are a couple snippets of some Opeth stuff there, but they are kind of sloppy and mostly just done as a tone test than an actual proper recording. I'd like to record a cover of Ghost of Perdition into Baying of the Hounds in one take, those are two of my favourite songs. Also Harlequin Forest is great fun to play. I recorded a cover of Wreath from the Deliverance album years ago with a friend of mine but I would consider it pretty garbage by my current standards so I doubt I'd ever release it."

"Returning to guitar, thinking 7 string","Hi guys. I haven't played in 15 years. I played classical guitar from about 13-17. Really wanted to play metal but parents did not really appreciate that. Then got busy with college, career, etc. Career involved constant travel. Long story short, I was decent 15 years ago but haven't touched a guitar since. Finally no longer travel and recently realized ""Hey, I can play whatever the hell I want now and I finally have a lot of free time.""

So this time around I want to start right and play the music I want to play.

Since I am going to be re-orienting myself, I think I should start with 7 string instead of my muscle memory going to 6 first then adjusting to 7. Just start with 7. I have the fundamentals down (ie, scales) from my earlier playing. Watching a few youtube videos the past few days and this stuff has been flooding back from the dark corners of my brain. Only thing left now is to pick a guitar and play.

On that note, been researching guitars to choose what to buy. Amazing now being able to watch so many videos online of different guitars and hearing their sound being played by talented people.

From my research, these are the attributes I want:
Good crunchy sound
Floyd Rose &amp; neck through (was always a huge fan of high pitched solos and bends - alas my nylon acoustic wasn't the best platform)
Comfortable fretboard
Want to stay under $500
Don't want to have to change pickups at first. Want something decent but honestly I am not going to be good enough for a while to appreciate the difference in high end and midrange pickups and I won't be in a recording studio or on a stage in the foreseeable future.
I also don't like buying a cheap thing to then replace it with a better thing later. I like to buy something once that will last me a long time that I can grow into.

I found a lightly used $400 bc rich jrv 7 (purple 2010) that seems to have what I am looking for. Any other suggestions? Plan to buy it on Saturday."

"Returning to guitar, thinking 7 string","Thanks... so many subreddits lol"
"Returning to guitar, thinking 7 string","No problem man. My suggestions are to look into Ibanez and ESP guitars. Those are my favorite 7 strings on a budget."
"Returning to guitar, thinking 7 string","If you wanna narrow it down even further, try /r/7string. Community is really friendly and pretty helpful. Questions like this come up a lot. Hope this helps!"
"Returning to guitar, thinking 7 string","Check out Agile guitars. I have an [Interceptor Pro](http://www.rondomusic.com/custominterceptornov2014.html), it's got floyd rose(licensed i think), neck through, ebony neck, and stock EMG active pickups, so basically this should be right in your alley. I bought this guitar used on ebay for a little over $500, but that also included a coffin case in the purchase. Ebay would be your best bet if you can snipe a deal, however you can buy directly from their [store page](http://www.rondomusic.com/7string.html), as well as place a [custom order](http://www.rondomusic.com/customquote.html) if you have the money and time."
"Returning to guitar, thinking 7 string","Just a heads up, there are several online shops (sweetwater, american musical, and zzounds) that offer a minimum of a 3 payment plan (sometimes as high as 12) without any financing or credit cards involved. This might allow you to bump up to a slightly better 'long term' guitar with the payments spread over 3+ months. I've used this process to buy my last several that I wouldn't have been able to afford 'upfront'. Good luck. "
"Returning to guitar, thinking 7 string","I'll second agile. They're known for having good extended range guitars."
"Returning to guitar, thinking 7 string","[deleted]"
"Returning to guitar, thinking 7 string","I'd do an Ibanez over an Agile. You can find either for about the same price and quality. But it's really based on your preference. Agile guitars have beefier necks compared to Ibanez and when it comes to a wider 7 string neck I like the slimmer profile a lot better. Also I really like Ibanez's floyd rose style bridges. They're a lot easier to re-string than your typical floyd. I think 7 string would be a good choice though, they're super versatile and you can find some really creative chord voicings."

"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?",""
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","I think the pups are probably the single biggest factor in tone, but the rest of the guitar does make a difference. I have moved a pup from guitar to guitar and they sounded different,  even though the were using the exact same pup. "
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","I wouldn't say $500 is cheap. For 500 you could get a lot better of a guitar IMO. I'm not impressed at all by the tone really."
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","There are 5 main blocks when it comes to guitar playing which form tone.

1) Guitar Wood

2) Pick Ups

3) Amp

4) Amp Settings

5) Technique

1 and 5 usually being the most important. 

For example, you could get John Petrucci's Music Man, his Boogie set up and pedalboard but you probably won't sound like him unless you're able to emulate his phrasing, his style of play.

If you know what you/producer knows what they're doing you can make most things sound half-decent.

With that being said, that Peavey doesn't really sound TOO bad. Although I'm not a big fan of EMG, I have one guitar which has a set of HZs in them. I prefer my scatterwounds. 
"
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","What pick ups are those? They look and sound like emg's. Sounds fine, I was just reading Chris Letchford of [Scale the Summit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfEpaGTPCZY) talking about how pick ups are the only important part of the guitar and they're where all your tone comes from. He's working on a new Jazz album and using the same set of EMG's he uses in his work with Scale the Summit. I don't know where I really stand on that option, but he's clearly a much better guitarist than me &amp; has many more years under his belt. "
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","I would answer that by saying there's a very good reason that most players don't buy cheap-ass copies and throw a set of upmarket pups in there. I could list all the different parts of a guitar that are responsible for subtle nuances in tone, but I'll just point out the screamingly obvious: rosewood vs lacquered maple fretboard. Worlds apart for me."
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","He said ""Its all about the pickups, so you can get the cheapest possible guitar as long as it has a nice set of pickups in it."" 

It's been bugging me so much, I really look up to the guy. Still I just have to disagree with that on so many levels. Still not like I have to believe everything I hear, I just feel that he know so much more about music than me and I've been hung up on that for days now. 

Thanks for getting my head clear again! "
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","I'm a fan of the band, for sure, but I vehemently disagree with the dude on this point. I wonder what made him think that... Tone differences aside, I really don't believe that even the best set-up cheap Vietnamese model would be anywhere near as easy to play as a nice Japanese model with a respectable setup."
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","Do you have empirical evidence or is that personal superstition though?"
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","Sure. Pick up a Fender Strat with a lacquered maple neck, then pick up a Fender Strat of the same series with a rosewood neck. Keep the amp settings the same, and tell me if you don't notice a difference, especially on a clean setting. 
You could also try maybe a light guitar like an Ibanez vs a heavy guitar like a Yamaha SG or a Les Paul. 
And these are just the really obvious tone differences, there's a whole bunch of stuff that makes more subtle differences to the output tone. 
Source for clarification: worked in the biggest guitar store in the UK for 3 years, I've probably played a couple of thousand different guitars."
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","I get what you're saying, but, I think it would need to be tested blind and with a control.

You'd need a robot arm to play the guitar exactly the same and stuff, the actual exact pups and wiring switched between guitars. Same pickup height from strings too and so on.

I know I for one actually play differently depending on how the guitar feels too."
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","It's not actually using those pickups.

It's a piezo bridge, picks up the strings individually then pitch shifts them, emulates a pickup sound and sends it out.

The guitar's strings are actually tuned a half step up from normal."
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","You -can- use the pups, but I'm not in this example. Just to be clear in case I sounded insane."
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","They sound really cool, I'll have to look into them. "
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","That's absolutely false in so many ways. So much of the tone comes from the woods. 

A mahogany guitar is going to sound very different than a maple or ash guitar to anyone who has been playing guitar longer than four years. 

Also pickups aren't the only thing to do with sustain. If your intonation, neck-joint, really anything can mess up your sustain, and it's incredibly noticeable unless you never do bends. 

Pickups contribute a lot to tone, but the quality of the guitar *does* show. 

EDIT: Finally got to watch the video. The tone was a pretty generic modern tone, although it was a bit dry, from what I could hear, and it was also pretty produced, so you can't get the sound of the actual guitar without the compression, EQ, and whatever other effects."
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","I agree, It's just I really looked up to this guy, I know end of the day he's a much better guitarist than me. I don't know why I even let myself think something like that. 

I have a friend how had a schecter Hell raiser that had the same pick ups as one of my Ibanez and they had a night and day difference. Well, duh one was made of basswood and the other was mahogany. 

I enjoy Chris's tone in Scale the Summit. Still in the past I've always thought that EMG kinda sucked and had a very generic tone. Thanks for your time. You have no clue how stupid I feel for thinking that way. It's just I really looked up to that guy, and I tend to be kinda foolish when I hear someone I look up to say something about music. Thanks for your time! "
"Cheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?","Hey don't worry about it man, I didn't intend to sound condescending, if it seemed like that. I have a tendency to. I understand when someone says stuff about music we have a tendency to take things too close to heart, s'all good brother."

"Started off with a raw vocal track, finished up with this song. What do you think?","Wait... you built a song off of the vocals?"
"Started off with a raw vocal track, finished up with this song. What do you think?","Yeah, I got the vocals from [here](http://www.looperman.com/acapellas/detail/4530) and made the song around them."
"Started off with a raw vocal track, finished up with this song. What do you think?","holy shit I might wanna try. Where can I find more?"
"Started off with a raw vocal track, finished up with this song. What do you think?","On the site that I linked, the guy that posted that vocal track has another vocal track called Blackwater which is pretty good. Apart from that, it's pretty hard to find metal vocals tracks that are actually usable for this kind of thing."
"Started off with a raw vocal track, finished up with this song. What do you think?","Not bad. Very classic metal sound but not too simple to keep it interesting. I would redo the 1st solo cause it ends a bit out of tune. Unless that was the goal. I like the structure of the piece. I think it flows from part to part very well. Love that Major 7 chord at 3:50. It sounds like the song is over there but then you kick it back in with the main riff. Neat tune. "
"Started off with a raw vocal track, finished up with this song. What do you think?","Thanks! I was using crappy old strings for this song that didn't stay in tune very well, I have since learned that new strings sound a lot better!"
"Started off with a raw vocal track, finished up with this song. What do you think?","Yeah man. Never record on old strings. New strings will always sound the same(or a lot closer). Works better when overdubbing too"

"I found this sub through a friend, and for my first post here, I figured I'd share a song of mine with everyone. What do you guys think?","Sounds good dude!
Perhaps try using some more variation in the velocites of the kick drums or use more than one kick sample, but that's just nitpicking."
"I found this sub through a friend, and for my first post here, I figured I'd share a song of mine with everyone.

I wish I had a better recording program than ACID, because at the very least I'd have liked to drop every other kick sound down by a few cents so they at least *sounded* different, but...y'know, ACID. -_-"

"Can someone totally walk me through drum programming in reaper please?","I just need to record sketches until my drummer friend gets mics, but for now I need a good free program and I need to know how to use it and I'm totally stuck"
"Can someone totally walk me through drum programming in reaper please?","First is getting some sort of drum sampler. Ezdrummer, Superior drummer, or some free alternative. Google for something that suits your needs. 

When you have something and you've installed it, etc., insert it as a midi instrument on a new track in reaper. Then, highlight the length of the track you need for your drum part. 

Go to insert in the menu bar and then insert new midi item. When it appears, double click on it and it should open the midi editor. Keys on the piano scroll will correspond with certain drums/cymbals. 

That's a rough run through of what to do. There's a lot of guides online on how to program drums well, how to make everything sounds real, and then how to mix them. But this should hopefully get you started. "
"Can someone totally walk me through drum programming in reaper please?","Unfortunately I don't use Reaper but I thought I'd point you to some great free samples (http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/backline/529782-sharing-my-collection-drum-samples-here.html). Maybe they can be of use to you."
"Can someone totally walk me through drum programming in reaper please?","I just use ezdrummer in reaper and it works great"
"Can someone totally walk me through drum programming in reaper please?","I've used all the different drum plugins that I could torrent, and I ended up buying jamstix.  There's a learning curve, and you have to read the manual, maybe 2 times, but once you get it, it kills the rest.  It's like a real live drummer as a Kemper is a real tube amp.

No matter what you chose to use, you'll have to learn it.

If you have a drummer person, why not record him and just use samples?  It'll take time, but it'll be the actual drummer instead of a vsti."

Thinking of putting together a bass from parts with my Dad (I believe it's a P-Bass body?

(Preferably passive, reasonably inexpensive, and at least semi decent for bass tone). 

Thanks in advance!"

"Bugera 1960........Budget Modern High Gain??!?!","Wow this sounds fantastic, especially considering your recording method (no offence) ..I remember looking at a bugera before settling on a Mesa 50 cal but now I'm starting to reconsider haha"
"Bugera 1960........Budget Modern High Gain??!?!","Haha hey it's just taking the same preamp signal before it hits the power amp! People always talk about Bugera being unreliable, but I've used this on stage for 2 years no problems, and before that my buddy used it for a few years , not knowing that he was running the head at 16 ohms into a 4 ohm cab! Turns out he had been accidentally doing that for almost 2 years. So the high end amp people will say what they want about Bugera, but this thing has served me very well. "

I did this with my new favorite trick: plug a garbage dummy speaker into the amp, plug the amps effect send into my DAW, and then connect a cable to the amps effect return but DONT plug that into anything- leave it hanging. Having the blank cable in the effects loop return tricks the amp into sending an empty signal to the power section, and just like that, silent tube amp recording that wont blow up your gear!"

"My band did a cover of Slaves to Substance by Suicide Silence, recorded in 3 days in my garage, tell me what you think",""
"My band did a cover of Slaves to Substance by Suicide Silence, recorded in 3 days in my garage, tell me what you think","Disclaimer - this is 100% my opinion, and may sound a little bit harsh.

I'll start with the choice of genre.

Deathcore is, quite frankly, the nu-metal of the 2010s. The only -cores worth your time are mathcore and grindcore. A good NxDx or Repulsion cover would sound great on a demo. Covering stuff like Dillinger is great if you can do it, but it's very difficult. I think choice of genre is why you're getting downvoted so heavily here.

The person doing the high vocals has a great, punchy voice for Grind/Powerviolence. Check out ANb's [Agorapocalypse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMoRrk95H5M) for excellent vocals.

It'd be nice if you could try and get a bit more ""snarl"" with the guitar tone - make it nastier. The mix is way too bassy; it's really muddy. You could do much more for the bass guitar by making the mix less bassy - I always find it a hallmark of a great mix when I can *hear* the bass well, like on [Eater of Birds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_1Zl3w23oE), an outstanding album by Black Metal duo Cobalt.

The drums are frankly fuckin' boring. I can't tell if it's a drum machine or a heavily triggered drummer or *what*. If it's drum programming, you'll want to do two things.

1) Listen to Agorapocalypse and read interviews with Scott Hull, especially the bits where he talks about drum programming. The drums are all programmed on that album. The programming is godly. Scott Hull is the god of drum programmers. Actually, you might want to make a shrine to him in your house /s (but it couldn't hurt anyway)

2) Go on youtube and watch. videos. of. actual. drummers. Y'know what they call a bad metal drummer? A drummer that listens only to metal. Go out there and watch stuff from guys like Buddy Rich, Benny Greb, Stanton Moore, Stef Broks, Eloy Casagrande, and Jamie Saint Merat to get a feel for interesting drum parts, both in metal and out. Then, apply those new things you've learned to the programming. If you have a friend who's a drummer, they can help you out too.

If you have a real drummer, tell them to make their parts more interesting: Blast beats (with very few exceptions) shouldn't be just right hand on hi-hat, left hand on snare, rf lf alternating. You need to Accent! Your! Blasts! Use ride bells, China cymbals, crashes, everything!

That's really all I have."

"Here's a new death metal song I just finished. What do you think?","You don't have to have an expensive setup to get a decent sound. If you could tell us what equipment you're using for recording I'm pretty sure we can help. 
Also you should work on humanizing the drums. Especially for snare rolls. They sound really robotic. "
"Here's a new death metal song I just finished. What do you think?","The only piece of equipment I use for recording is my M-Audio Fast Track interface, which came with Pro Tools SE. "
"Here's a new death metal song I just finished. What do you think?","You should be able to get a much better sound for *free*, especially the drums.  Don't be afraid of reverb on the drums, it's the only way to make them sound real, which is most true for those cymbals.  If there's a bass in this recording, feel free to turn it up.  Bass is important, and it's often buried under guitar tones that are too thick, or in this case, too thin and loud.

As for the song writing, it's way too melodic and pretty sounding. "
"Here's a new death metal song I just finished. What do you think?","I'm going to be completely honest here and disagree with you. Especially on the song writing. Just because its ""melodic and pretty sounding,"" doesn't mean its bad. Thats a matter of personal opinion and if you feel that way then clearly my songwriting style is just not for you.   
  
The drums do sound pretty fake, but thats because they obviously are. Cant even argue with that one, I'll add some reverb next time. Thanks for that advice.  
  
For the guitar and bass however, lets be realistic. You are certainly entitled to your opinion, but the guitar and bass tones are really not that bad. Sure, they're not great or professional quality by any means. However, for this song being made in the bedroom of an 18 year old kid in less than a day, its really not that bad. Also, I don't know what kind of speakers you played the song through, but the bass is definitely audible and at a relatively appropriate volume. I listened to it through a 15 year old desktop Dell speaker and I have no trouble hearing it at all.  
  
Anyways, thanks for the comment and taking the time to give my song a listen. "
"Here's a new death metal song I just finished. What do you think?","Bro. Calm down. The types of riffs you are playing are old school Swedish riffs, which the metal core scene had done to death. Nothing wrong with it, but it has been done to death for a lot of us. 

As far as your tone, check out Nick crows 8505 plugin with lecab, with some free impulses you can find online. "
"Here's a new death metal song I just finished. What do you think?","I'm completely calm, was just giving a response to his criticisms. Thanks for the advice, I will look into that. Although, I'm not sure if my particular interface can use plugins because the software is a limited version of pro tools."
"Here's a new death metal song I just finished. What do you think?","&gt; Thats a matter of personal opinion 

Obviously. Your shitty pretty music is not my thing. Don't cry about it.  You literally asked for opinions.  I gave mine. 

&gt; The drums do sound pretty fake, but thats because they obviously are. Cant even argue with that one, I'll add some reverb next time. Thanks for that advice. 

Try lowing the sound of the cymbals, and adding reverb to the entire track, plus a *little* bit of compression to pull up the sound of the trailing reverb. Should make it sound a touch more realistic. Also, if your drum machine has a humanizing/timing offset feature, use it.  Perfect drums sound terrible. Tip: rolls are usually played faster than the beat of the track, out of habit. If you were playing live, without a click track, it's almost a guarantee the rolls would be a couple of beats faster than the rest of the track. Humans are weird like that. Computers don't know how to be human-like without human intervention. 
  
&gt; its really not that bad

A bit of attention to detail could have made the track a thousand times more listenable.  The guitar tones are really high in the gain department, something that's usually frowned upon in the melodic death metal genre. Listen to some old At The Gates and see what I'm talking about.  Thicker tones *will* sound better.


&gt; the bass is definitely audible

I can hear the bass, but the tones are all fucked up and it hides the bass tones.  Seriously, don't be afraid to turn up the bass, and turn down the guitars.  Turn down the cymbals, too."

"Here's a new death metal song I just finished. What do you think?","That was pretty tight. I like what you were trying to accomplish but it was just too artificial.

I'm really liking the sound of this, but I'd probably think of it more as regular ol' video game music rather than metal, drumming aside (although a lot of classic video game scores have metal influence, so the line is a bit blurry).  Do you have plans to expand on it, or will you keep it as-is?

One thing I'd recommend is maybe easing up on the double bass a bit.  It fits some parts, but it feels gratuitous in others."

Also, if you'd like a little mix feedback, I think everything sounds really good and clear but the drums could be a bit ""bigger"" for my taste. Granted, I'm listening at a quiet volume right now, so I could be wrong. I'm not sure if they're lacking some room sound or if they're a bit clicky for me.

The guitar tone is actually BIAS with a TSE808 in front and some impulses I liked. BIAS is *insanely* good.

And as for the mixes, I don't think they're too quiet necessarily, and I don't know exactly what sound you're going for, but it sounds like the guitars could be turned down ever so slightly, the snare could be a little more present, and the bass is missing low end and could be a bit more present too.

"Okay, I need help.","Sent here from /r/metal

Long story short, I'm pretty damn lame at guitar. I can play a fair few songs but they're all pretty simple to play.
I haven't much money to spend on lessons or kits to help myself learn and I'm not one to learn by ear (not yet at least).
Just wondering if anyone is able to recommend or give any advice on how to improve and finally feel like I'm progressing. I don't know how to read scales yet either which feels like a big issue but every time I research them I just stare dead at the screen and it all goes over my head.
Sorry for the plea, but I feel this really is the best place to come for help. Many thanks!

"Anyone had good experiences with Kickstarter?","So I'm hoping to record my first album/EP this summer or in the fall. I'm thinking EP because I want to just do my first 4 songs on this release, and that's approximately 30 min of music. About as long as a typical full-length but I think the number of songs makes it an EP. I don't know. 

I have little to no solid fanbase- about 33 followers on soundcloud and a couple hundred views on youtube, 35 FB fans. I'm hoping once I make a kickstarter I can garner enough support through reddit and metal forums to make it work. The studio I'm planning on going to is only 25 dollars an hour so I was going to shoot low for my goal and just cover the rest out of pocket. As one who is paying off student loans, any little bit will help. 

So anyway, just wondering what your experiences have been Shreddit. If you want an idea of my sound, please visit my soundcloud here: https://soundcloud.com/dr-ug-1 I've got one song recorded from a couple years ago, but I've since revised it and done the drum programming all myself as opposed to having my friend use Superior drummer beats.

Taken from the days when singles were REALLY hot shit, vinyl wise. An EP was basically a single with a couple of extra tunes. Usually about 15-20/25 minutes or so in length. 

In regards to using Kickstarter. I've never used it although I reckon you will need a fair size support to really reap any benefit from it.

"Let's Talk Bass, Week IV: Counterpoint","Welcome back. This week we're going to expand your lick vocabulary with a concept dating back to Bach, and possibly further than that! That concept is counterpoint.

An advance warning: There is some heavy theory in this part.

First, a few definitions of counterpoint. The lede of [Wikipedia's article about counterpoint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint) (which I am paraphrasing heavily for the theory of counterpoint) describes it thus:

&gt;In music, counterpoint is the relationship between voices that are interdependent harmonically (polyphony) and yet are independent in rhythm and contour.

Later in the article, composer and University of Washington Music prof John Rahn describes it like this:

&gt;It is hard to write a beautiful song. It is harder to write several individually beautiful songs that, when sung simultaneously, sound as a more beautiful polyphonic whole. The internal structures that create each of the voices separately must contribute to the emergent structure of the polyphony, which in turn must reinforce and comment on the structures of the individual voices. The way that is accomplished in detail is...'counterpoint'.

In *my* words, counterpoint is the art of writing two different melodies that complement each other.

**Species counterpoint**, or **strict counterpoint**, was developed as a tool for teaching student composers, who would go through several ""species"" of increasing complexity. This was largely codified by a Johann Fux in 1725 with his textbook *Gradus ad Parnassum* (Steps to Parnassus). I won't bore you with all of the rules of species counterpoint that he defined, but some of the most important ones were:

1. *The counterpoint should begin and end on perfect consonance.* This means the combination of notes should involve only unisons, octaves, perfect fourths, and perfect fifths. A power chord has perfect consonance.

2. *Contrary motion should predominate.* This means that the two melodic lines should be moving opposite each other most of the time. The other types of motion are parallel (which we covered in Part I as ""doubling""), similar (where the lines move in the same direction, but in different intervals, common in Maiden guitar harmonies), and oblique (which we covered in Part I as ""pedaling,"" where one voice moves while the other stays in place)

3. *Perfect consonances must be approached by oblique or contrary motion.* Since the piece must begin and end with perfect consonance, the piece must have either of these right before the ending.

4. *Imperfect consonances may be anyhow approached.* This refers to thirds and sixths, both minor and major.

There are many others, but these give you the idea.

Sound stifling? In a way, it's intended to be. As I said, Species Counterpoint was intended as a teaching tool, to teach students to understand the harmony of different motion types. Students would ""graduate"" from this to...

**Free Counterpoint**, which is not as reliant on those rules. This started development in the Baroque period and has continued developing until the present day, though it was not taught widely until the nineteenth century. There are other types as well, including dissonant counterpoint (where dissonance is the rule rather than consonance) and linear counterpoint (where neither melodic line gives a shit about the other one, resulting in dissonance and consonance willy-nilly).

So how does this all relate to bass? Well, put simply, counterpoint is a powerful tool for making a bass-line interesting. Once again, I'm going to demonstrate with a line I wrote. [This](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38920383/Sarrem%20Demo.m4a) is a demo of the line against a guitar/drum scratch track, with the bass super-boosted and slightly chorused. The part during the verse riff (second one) sounds very busy, but it breaks down something like this:


A|-7--5-7--5-7--8--7-8--7-8--10--8-10--8-10--12-12-12-12-12-12-12-

Obviously the guitar is not playing this. I'm actually not sure exactly what the guitar is playing in terms of the theory (hence why I paraphrased all that theory jargon from wikipedia). But it doesn't go up like the bass-line does. This creates a counterpoint between the two lines.

Some places to go to look for counterpoint in bass/metal:

- Opeth's first two albums have a ton of counterpoint, usually between the guitars. Apparently they had a lot of imitators, which led to the stylistic change for *My Arms Your Hearse*, but I don't know any of the imitators. Opeth still does this in their later material (I was listening to ""When"" live just now, and the bass does some contrapuntal licks, particularly in the quiet section starting around the 6-minute mark), but not as much.

- Yes's bassist Chris Squire does counterpoint a lot in writing his bass-lines. Check out songs like Starship Trooper, Close to the Edge, and Roundabout.

- Iron Maiden's song ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has a brief counterpoint moment during the instrumental bridge (the bass solo and the guitar parts after are the main counterpoint). Their guitar harmonies occasionally feature similar motion, where the interval between the guitars will switch from a major third to a minor third and back.

I'm going to leave this part a bit shorter and leave it open for questions. So any questions you have, fire away.

Next time we'll go into more detail about effects, as I didn't cover them sufficiently for my liking in Part II."
"Let's Talk Bass, Week IV: Counterpoint","This series is great, thanks for keeping this going!  I just wanted to leave some positive feedback so you know your work is being read, since this sub is pretty small.  As a bass player who wants to graduate from playing covers to writing my own death metal, these quick overviews of important concepts are giving me all sorts of jumping-off points -- places to start experimenting and doing deeper research.

One thing I'm wondering about is whether I should work on my guitar chops if I want to write full songs.  I don't have a band (at least, the friends I practice covers with aren't at all interested in death metal) and it seems like a lot of bands write guitar parts first.  I've also got a keyboard I can use to write with, and I know it's possible to write guitar parts on a bass with a bit of imagination... I guess I'm just asking if you have any specific advice for bassists who want to write full songs.  I know that seems a bit off-topic, but well... I need some guitar parts if I'm going to practice writing contrapuntal bass lines!"
"Let's Talk Bass, Week IV: Counterpoint","Having some skill on any instrument is hardly a bad thing, even if only to write songs. I don't have much of a way to work on guitar myself, but if I could I certainly would.

On the other hand, writing a song based around a bass-line can be an interesting exercise in itself. For that I'd recommend getting a drum machine, so you can have a beat."
"Let's Talk Bass, Week IV: Counterpoint","That part in Phantom of the Opera is one of my favorite Maiden moments. Guess this explains why I like it so much! I'll have to try and write some stuff utilizing this. Thanks for the write up!"

"Let's Talk Bass, Week IV: Counterpoint","Cool post. Nice to see some music theory here. I'd say that understanding harmony (for tonal music of course) is a prerequisite to writing meaningful contrapuntal line, especially for bass. Without a good understanding of harmony, writing contrapuntal line simply amounts to ""write something different than what you do on guitar"". Which isn't saying much. "

"Bass tunings??","Alright I've heard that some bass players tune up instead of down when paired with heavily de-tuned guitars, so what would I tune a bass to if the guitars are in drop A#, drop B, and/or drop C?"
"Bass tunings??","You don't need to tune up. 

Meshuggah does this to match the eight string guitars. Now, Meshuggah are, uh... *unique*. when they began using eight strings, there were no commercially available eight string guitars, and extended range basses were a rarity. So not only did nobody know what to do with a bass that would have to be tuned nearly an octave down to match the guitars (Meshuggah tunes to F), there was no equipment available that could facilitate that for bass. Very few cabinets could handle that range, and no strings thick enough to hold tension there existed, so Meshuggah's solution was to just tune up the bass and have it play unison parts. Their explanation for continuing to do this these days is that it's part of the sound now.

Now, I don't know about you, but the only bassist I've heard of doing this is Dick from  Meshuggah. These days, there really is no excuse to tune up anymore, except as an artistic decision. Heavy strings are easier to find, there are cabinets and basses that can handle F# (and even down to C#). 

That's F-F#. A seventh down. The lowest you're looking at is A#, less than a fifth down. As a bassist, I can tell you this is FINE for conventional tuning an octave below the guitars. I wouldn't even call that a very low tuning. Alex Webster has been using A# since 1995 with great success, and there are plenty of people who tune lower than that no problem. Off the top of my head:

* [Jeff Hughell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QplRR_CfkkI) of Brain Drill, Reciprocal, and Six Feet Under tunes to Drop A frequently, but usually plays in G Standard, even lower.
*[ Adam ""Nolly"" Getgood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMxbP1V3WBo) from Periphery tunes to all sorts of crazy stuff to match their seven and eight strings. Drop C with a low G below the C, Drop G#, and even F# Standard.
* Every bassist [Nile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99KHIkENKBM) has had since 1993 has tuned to Drop A no problems
* Derek Boyer from[ Suffocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peP_xXWXtPM) tunes to C# Standard with a low G#
* Come to think of it, [Alex Webster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJQX4Ow2NHQ) uses [G# Standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3tTp7tgAbI) a lot in Cannibal Corpse, and uses Drop A in both his other bands.

I myself have gone down to G Standard no problems. All you really need to downtune to drop C-A# are thicker strings. Most bass amps can reproduce those fundamentals or close to it, and those aren't low enough to warrant a longer scale length. This can be a little tricky, though, since string sets are made for standard tuning in fourths as a general rule. You may have to pick strings carefully to achieve a pleasant tension.

So yes. If I've confused you anywhere, please let me know and I'll clear it up. Otherwise, good luck!"
"Bass tunings??","This is only when the guitars are too low for the bass to easily play an octave down. To me, this territory was anything lower than A#. This, of course, assumes 35 inch scale and commercially available strings. 


Most basses handle drop A with no major issues. "
"Bass tunings??","Oh alright thanks! Haha so what exactly would I be tuning to? I have to track some bass parts (I'm a guitarist) and have no idea what I'm doing, as bass is some differently entirely and a buddy of mines bass is super out of tune, a chromatic tuner can tune basses right?"
"Bass tunings??","In the tunings you mentioned, you really shouldn't have a problem tuning your bass just like you tune your guitar. On a four string, drop A# would be A#-F-A#-D#, drop B would be B-F#-B-E, and drop C would be C-G-C-F."
"Bass tunings??","[deleted]"
"Bass tunings??","One of my guitars is in drop G# - my bass handles it fine, but it is a 6 string. Anything below that I would probably tune up to.

So if it's in Drop F, tune the bass exactly the same as the guitar. The bass itself produces more bass frequencies than the guitar in the same octave anyway. You will still get bass in your songs. "
"Bass tunings??","Mechanically you can have some issues; I had to drill out the bridge on my Schecter five-string to accommodate a low string thick enough to handle tuning down to drop A and my heavy pick hand. I agree with everyone else, stay low bro."
"Bass tunings??","In my band we play guitars tuned to drop C.

My bass player found the best solution was to tune his 5 string bass UP a half step, to put him in C standard. 

If he tuned down to match us like a normal bass would, he would tune his E string to C and his B all the way down to G. By tuning up a half step, it made his lowest string one octave lower than the lowest string on the guitars. As long as he ran with light gauge strings he did not have any issues with the bass's set up. If he tuned down he would definitely have had to do some work on the instrument to get that low G to work."
"Bass tunings??","I've never heard of anyone doing that before, and I think that tuning up to a low tuned guitar would cause everything to sound flat (dimensionally, not pitch-wise). The bass is supposed to occupy a different frequency range than guitars, and this is especially important in metal to get the ""full"" sound. Instead of tuning up, tune down or use a bass with 5th string."
"Bass tunings??","Ahh thank you, well I heard Meshuggah's bassist does this to be specific haha but yeah I didn't think it would work well drop A# but I wanted to give it a shot!"
"Bass tunings??","Their bassist uses a 5 string, with the E string tuned up to their usual F# tuning. As for the other strings, I'm not sure. "
"Bass tunings??","Ahh yes I forgot about the 5th string haha"
"I really want to step up the quality of my recordings. Would appreciate some advice.","[Currently, this is how my songs sound.](https://soundcloud.com/adezfoolian/of-machine)

[Here's another example.](https://soundcloud.com/adezfoolian/among-stars)

To record my guitars, I use a auxiliary cable and put one end in the headphone jack of the amp and the other end in the mic port of my computer. That's it.

If I don't want to use a mic, (I can't really make that much noise) is the best solution an interface like [this](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/pro-audio/focusrite-scarlett-2i4-usb-audio-interface) combined with a DAW and some VSTs? If so, how much does the interface itself matter? Would the one I linked work?

Thanks a bunch!"
"I really want to step up the quality of my recordings. Would appreciate some advice.","That interface would definitely work well for DI recording in a home studio. When considering an interface, you want to look into how many input/outputs you'll need, quality of preamps (does it break/distort), any extra features desired (level monitoring, usb 1/2/3 or firewire, xlr input, ect.), and reliability of brand. I'll assume the only recording you do is guitar/bass while leaving drums to a program, the forcusrite has more than enough channels for that. It also leaves the option of using a mic if you choose to down the road. 

[Here's a video of the guitarist of Periphery using the same interface](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er9VhozNHNk), except he's using Axe FX to get his tone. In your case you can either continue using the headphone jack of your amp (redundant), or as you suggested, just use VSTs."
"I really want to step up the quality of my recordings. Would appreciate some advice.","Thanks! I actually remember seeing that video a while back and it was one of the reasons me wanting me to step up the quality!

When you say you ""you can either continue using the headphone jack of your amp"", do you mean plug that into the interface, and the interface into the computer? Would that make a difference compared to what I am doing now?

Also, what VSTs are recommended? I have only used a couple of free ones. 

And I like this interface because it has options for MIDI too, which I have dabbled with using my piano/keyboard."
"I really want to step up the quality of my recordings. Would appreciate some advice.","Not really, although I suppose it may depend on the quality of your mobile device or sound card. Most people need pre-amps simply because going straight into the computer from an amp jack leaves an incredibly inaudible signal.

Listening to your song I can tell you that picking a different fuzz, EQing, and mastering are going to make the biggest different. Yeah, fancy DAW's that let you add frequency response patches will help add some of that fiece attack to your tone, but if you don't feel like pirating or paying tons of money for a cramped and resource heavy DAW, start by cutting the mids on your pre-production tone (on your amp) to give it some more bounciness, and high shelf one of the guitars on your recording to help distinguish the guitar from the bass. Then cut out most of the unused frequencies on your bass, cymbals, kick, and snare drum, and the you'll be able to increase the volume of all of the above while keeping the clarity of all of them.

EDIT: Also, don't record super hot. I know a lot of people say turn the volume up to as high as it will go without clipping, in order to increase the volume to background hum ratio, but having some headroom in your bare guitar tracks is nice, so that in the event you want to boost a frequency, raise the volume of something, or just add harshness or dirt, you won't run into any problems.

Song was good too"
"I really want to step up the quality of my recordings. Would appreciate some advice.","Thanks for the comment!

I find that when I turn down the mids down too much on my amp, it just starts to sound kind of tinny and low(er) quality. 

What does 'shelf' one of the guitars mean? In fact, I'm not sure what ""cut out most of the unused frequencies on your bass, cymbals, kick, and snare drum"" means either, could you please explain it?Sorry, I'm such a noob when it comes to recording. My recording setup is so barebones and I don't ever really mess with anything afterwards, so it's all really foreign to me.

And thanks for the compliment, glad you liked the song! :)"
"I really want to step up the quality of my recordings. Would appreciate some advice.","Well there are no exact ways to do it but basically a high shelf is when you EQ out all the low frequencies to give one of the guitars a grainier higher tone. On it's own it sounds like shit, but when you play it simultaneously with one or a few other tracks , it richens up the sound. Do that to either your left or right tracks. Adding a third track with different distortion can also fatten up the sound if you're feeling lazy and don't want to record a piece four times (Entombed did this on their first album. The L and R tracks go through HM-2's and a third Center track is a DS or something.)

Cymbals are high frequency percussion instruments. So if you cut everything below 5000ish, you'll reduce the volume of the lower frequencies that just take up space and let the distortion and bass fill that in. For your bass you should also greatly reduce all of the frequencies above a certain point, but that really depends on how grungy you want your bass to sound.

Ultimately, the EQ tool is going to be one of your best assets when shaping the tone of your music."
"I really want to step up the quality of my recordings. Would appreciate some advice.","I really wish I understood EQing better. I always hear people talk about it but I don't really understand it that well. The only thing I ever do with EQ is either increase the mids or decrease the mids, depending on what I want. But I don't really know anything else other than that. 

The two songs linked in the OP were actually tracked 4 times for just the rhythm parts. But it's the same tone all 4 times. Two of the tracks were lower volume, though."
"I really want to step up the quality of my recordings. Would appreciate some advice.","Yeah, don't be afraid to use different amps/settings for different tracks.

Honestly, you're going to have to got through a few shitty recordings until you get what you want. It's something you'll pick up over time and then get the hang of. There are lots of tutorials on tracking and high shelves and EQ in general on youtube though. One thing I've learned is that if you're going to make a cut, make it a big cut. Drop the frequencies you want out by like 20-30 decibels, and if that sounds too dead then lighten up on it from there. Don't just make some asinine wavy thing in the EQ chart with a few bumps. Only do that as like the very last step for minor tweaks when you've done everything else. Granted, I'm an amature, so if someone wants to correct me they can, but these seem to be good rules for me."
"I really want to step up the quality of my recordings. Would appreciate some advice.","The EQ that's shown in this video should give you a good idea of what to do for metal EQ (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6PHzkPjH7c). And for good EQ tools, you don't need Cubase or even Pro Tools. Any existing (Windows) DAW you have should be good as long as you have this plugin: http://www.vst4free.com/free_vst.php?id=478. Or if you want a free DAW, try LMMS. But the gist of is that you should look at the EQ settings the guy in the video used in his tracks, and mimic them in the plugin I just linked you to."

"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","I can get a SUPERRR gnarly guitar sound on its own and then everything else comes in and it's like... eh... s'alright I guess. Think it might be the drums?"
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","Possibly. I generally think of guitars as a huge blanket that covers anything and everything. Distorted guitars eat up so much frequency real-estate it's crazy. You may want to try cutting out some low end to let your kick/bass come through. Cutting some mud at around 350-5/600Hz *might* be a shout as well. It depends on your instrumentation. Cutting too much can be a bad thing though. A low pass filter can actually tighten up your tone as well as it can remove high-end fizzle, but this is much less of a 'general guideline' than the high pass. Try and make sure everything else is fucking great and then fit your guitars around it by chopping shit out of them. "
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","I agree with cutting the low end. If you want to scoop your mids, then you have to accept the fact that you're not gonna have bass because the low end just cuts in so much. And then you have to start EQing the bass drum if you really want to hear it and that's how you end up with clicky double kicks."
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","what /u/metalq said is the best option. get your tone so that even if you're using a shitty one dollar logitech rock band USB microphone it sounds good, and all you'll really need to do is EQ / compression to get rid of too much low end (which'll obscure drums &amp; bass) and the 5-6khz mark which is where the hoover-like hiss comes from with distortion"
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","What kind of compression?"
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","I use a low pass filter on my guitars to completely cut off any frequencies above 7.5khz, because with my tone that's where 90% of the hiss/static comes from, also I like to keep that freq range free for other instruments "

Is SSD4 way better than addictive drums? How much post are you doing? This whole thing sounds great, I wanna be able to make mixes that sound that good at home."
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","My guitar is going through a parallel amp configuration of an Ignite Emissary and a Lepou LeCto then going through parallel God's Cab impulses sm57 1inch cap and sm57 grill edge. The same setup is done for the other guitar and both are panned 100L and 100R. Then both go through a bus which has an eq looking like [this](http://i.imgur.com/wkWOtg7.jpg) and that's it. If your tone doesn't sound good, then it's the rest of the mix. This is the thing most people don't get. I've personally never mixed with addictive drums (except once I think) but from the demos I've heard you should be able to get a decent mix from it. For mixing drums, the advice I can give is don't overdo it. Most drum tracks should only have an EQ and compressor on them, although, a very important tool you should use is a gate. This helps clear your drums up a whole lot and I would suggest to use it just below the point where it sounds weird."
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","What is a parallel amo configuration, what is Ignite Emissary? I'm familiar with God's Cab impulses, will have to give them a shout, thanks.

What do you think about quad guitars? And when I'm mixing a song that has two harmony rhythm parts, should I record each thing twice? Four times? "
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","Parallel amp configuration means the guitar is going through two amps simultaneously. I had to use [metaplugin](http://www.ddmf.eu/product.php?id=3) in order to set this up properly. This is [Ignite Emissary](http://www.kvraudio.com/product/emissary-by-ignite-amps). Quad tracking depends on what you are doing. If it's fast stuff then double tracking is all you need, but if it's slow like downtempo, quad tracking is preferred. Usually with differing rhythm parts you should still do hard left and hard right, but still it just depends. If you're doing lead and rhythm, rhythm is double tracked, and lead goes in the center. Sometimes even lead is double tracked and put 30L and 30R or something just to fill in space. You just have to hear what you're doing and make a decision. I guess the rule you can make is, the lower it is, the more tracks that is required."
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","I also want to say that mixing the bass and kick correctly are absolutely essential in getting a good guitar tone"
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","Is there a way to ""hear"" for that?"
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","That's the tough part. I posted this a while ago about mixing bass.

&gt;The bass is tricky. If you're recording, set up two tracks and track both bass tracks simultaneously through a DI box. Low pass the first bass track below 133hz and then hi pass all the bass out of the second track and make it sound like a guitar. Bam now you have control of the low end and you can blend the bass tone with the guitar tone. Live bass is a bit different. You can use an EQ to control the low end with various levels of success. It wont be as awesome as having split channels but most the time you can't hear anything in a live show because shitty engineers so don't worry too much just make the bass as huge as possible (try cutting 230hz and boosting 58hz or 100hz).

For mixing kick, my advice would be taking out all the useless harmonics (200-1000hz etc.) and it will punch. "
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","Do you tweak the EQ between your guitar tracks to give them each a bit of room? I single track my riffs but if I ever throw on a second layer, I usually boost it around 2000 Hz, while my main rhythm is boosted at 1000 Hz."
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","I have experimented with that but it's usually not necessary. If I need the extra edge I'll do it."
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","I would get a tone that I dug the sound of playing on its own, a sound that inspired me to want to rock out. It typically had way too much bottom end to work well with a bass track and drums, so I would eq out maybe the bottom 25-30% of the recorded guitar track. I'd also do that for the bass guitar track, but only the bottom 15-20% or so of it. The guitar needs to leave room for the bass, and they both need to leave room for the drums. It's important to remember that the best guitar and bass tones on their own aren't always what works well in a recorded mix with other instruments.

Then I'd pan one guitar track hard left, another hard right. I'm not a fan of lots of layered guitar tracks, I think they ""smooth"" the guitar tone out too much. I think the guitar tone is more aggressive with just two tracks, or more raw vs. polished."
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","If you start with a harsh tone it will smooth out to be about the and though. I just leave any presence and treble controls further up than I would if I wasn't recording. I don't see how it's any different from cutting gain down and not cutting the kids as much.


Edit: Cutting mids not kids...well unless they deserve it."
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","I try to remember to carve out some space for bass."
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","[deleted]"
"What do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?","I treat my project like a live jazz band so I single track my rhythm guitar and then pan it with the bass soft R/L respectively (20%). Single tracked guitars really only sound ""weak"" when you scoop your mids, I do a mid boost and put just enough reverb to space it out a bit.

I volume level my tracks according to the drums - just loud enough to still heard double kicks, and I keep the bass audible so the guitars can get lost when vocals kick in. However, there are better ways to present your guitars besides just making them louder than everything else, namely through composition."

"Anyone here use Hydrogen for drums?","I've been trying to add drums to [this](https://soundcloud.com/tony15339/demosong08) song but it's way to  hard to figure out for me haha. [This](https://soundcloud.com/tony15339/demosong08plusdrums) what I could manage, it was pretty much a disaster. Anyone have any good tips or know any good videos on how to figure out how to use Hydrogen better and how to work out what count a songs in?"
"Anyone here use Hydrogen for drums?","[I use Hydrogen.](https://soundcloud.com/vincent_wisehoon/rot) With the right samples, it's a very feasible tool for metal. First off, it makes way more sense to start with a drum track and then record the guitars for it than vice versa. Your drum tracks probably aren't going to line up with your guitar playing, even if you used a click track. Trust me when I say it sounds way more natural. 

Start one riff at a time. When the song starts, do you want drums right away? Do you know when you want them to come in? How much? How gradually? If you want silence in the beginning (or any part for that matter) use an unused drum hit, or add a sound of your own and put it on each beat when there is silence elsewhere, and export it as a separate track. Now you have something to follow and play along in sync with even when there are no drum patterns to follow.

As for coming up with drum patterns, I trust that just listening to some of your favorite grooves and paying close attention to drum tracks in general should be enough to figure out what works with you. However, if you're completely clueless, There are a few basic rules that will get you pretty far as a beginner: Stick the snare on a consistent beat (either on the two/four or one/three for more of an aggressive marching metal sound) and then fill in which beats are important with the kick. You should always have something else playing to fill in the sound. Example: Try making a blast beat in Hydrogen with just the snare and kick. Sounds like crap right? Now add hat hits on each beat, and it will sound a lot better. Now, it will still sound robotic without randomization of pitch, velocity, humanization (which actually works pretty well in Hydrogen) and switching up different samples of the same hit, but you're getting the idea now: Set a tempo with the snare, groove with the kick, add ""perceived speed"" with either the high-hat or ride bell or whatever, then accent special parts of each measure with crashes, and do fills with toms.

As for the more technical procedures, just watching a few short instructional videos on youtube (any one will do really) on beginners drumming tips will help. Look up stuff like ""how to make a drum beat"", ""how to make drum fills"", or ""how to build better coordination for drumming.""

It takes a lot of careful tone adjustment, and of course, mixing and mastering to get it to sound right, but it definitely can be done."
"Anyone here use Hydrogen for drums?","Thanks these are great tips! I already get my riffs organized and then play them over the drums to see if they fit ahead of time so I know this riff can be done but I can't get the timing right in Hydrogen and I can't seem to get a fitting beat going, "
"Anyone here use Hydrogen for drums?","As /u/SolomonKull said in another comment, you should really be writing your riffs to drum tracks, or at the very least, to a click track/metronome (I sometimes save the drum part until last if I want to experiment with it, or just can't come up with something at first).

As for using Hydrogen to program drums, it can definitely be done for metal - I used to use it until I upgraded to using Toontrack's drum machine software/sample packs.  In addition to what /u/UltimateSasquatch said, you'll want to look for sample packs that include multiple hits for each drum (e.g. a pack with 10-20 samples of the same snare drum being hit in different ways).  This will help you to avoid the all-too-common issue of drum machines and triggered drum kits, where every hit for each drum sounds exactly the same, and will allow you to imitate the natural variations in a drum's sound that come from it being struck hard, softly, etc.  This requires you to tweak the velocity of each hit, which can be done in Hydrogen down the bottom of the window, under the drum sequencer itself.

Here's [an example](https://soundcloud.com/sinndogg/wip-song-010914) from a song I've been working on over the last few days, which shows what I mean (I used Toontrack's Metal Machine samples in conjunction with their EzDrummer software, but the same ideas still apply).  If you listen to the snare drum, for example, you'll notice that I've reduced the volume on off-beat hits, during blast beats, at certain points in fills, etc., to imitate the way that a live drummer would play things - no drummer is going to always be hitting the drum at the exact same velocity, especially when playing fast, and if you spend a bit of time working at it, you can get a decent approximation of those sorts of dynamics.  The almost drum-rollish bit on the snare in the final section (0:54 onwards) is a good example of what I mean, even if I think that the on-beat hit in the middle is a bit loud (I've reduced the volume of that hit since uploading).

A good way to work out how to do this is to listen to albums where there's little to no triggering on the drums, and listen for these sorts of dynamics where they appear.  It's pretty obvious that drummers are going to be hitting their snare drums more softly during blast beats, because you just can't hit as hard when you're playing fast, but what about during drum fills or grooves?  It can take a bit of getting used-to, and will definitely mean a bit more time spent on drum programming per song, but it will really help to remove some of the artificial sound that comes with using a drum machine (you'll notice that most bands that use drum machines don't bother with tweaking velocity, or use drum machines/programs that don't have that feature built in, so it tends to be glaringly obvious).

There's a pretty good collection of drum samples that you can use for metal [here](http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/backline/529782-sharing-my-collection-drum-samples-here.html), with loads of hits for each drum in most cases.  It may take some work to get them sounding right in your mix, and a lot of the bass drum samples are weak on their own, but they're a good first step if you're not able to afford something like EzDrummer/Superior Drummer or Addictive Drums."
"Anyone here use Hydrogen for drums?","Why the hell are you recording drum tracks after guitar? You need to play the guitar to the drum track...

Write the guitar tracks, then write the drum tracks, then record the drum tracks, then record the guitar tracks.
"
"Anyone here use Hydrogen for drums?","Haha I re recorded that segment to match the drums as best as I could, it's the drum beat that's fucked, it's faster than I want it to be yet the accents lie almost exactly where I want them. "
"Anyone here use Hydrogen for drums?","Obvious, *obviously* you play guitars to the drum track. There will never be a problem if you play your guitar tracks over the drum tracks. If the drum track is too fast, change the tempo. You didn't just record guitar tracks without a metronome *or* a drum track, did you?  You should always play the guitar parts over the drum track, and you'll never have any problems with tempo... You should know the timing of your tracks because you literally created them. If you're playing a song that isn't 4/4 then you're not going to be able to track drum with a 4/4 timing. "
"Anyone here use Hydrogen for drums?","Agreed.  It's a good idea to spend some time working out exactly what time signatures your riffs are played in as you come up with them, and play along to a metronome/click track set to the tempo that you want to play it in (or, at the very least, record to a pre-existing drum track).  If you can't count it out, then *definitely* spend some time learning about the basics of time signatures and musical measures."

"What does my doom tone need?",""
"What does my doom tone need?","Nobody has said cowbell yet? I'm going with cowbell.

No, but in all seriousness, a bit tighter and longer distortion. Also the bass could be a bit heavier/darker."
"What does my doom tone need?","Okay. What do you mean by that? Like I know the distortion breaks up a lot on the chugging parts but how do I dial in a tone that doesn't? When I play out of my amp it doesn't sound like that, but gooing line in into my computer records a muddier sound."
"What does my doom tone need?","Unfortunately I'm not an expert of any sort when it comes to audio production, so I have no idea how to achieve it. What I mean, I guess, is you could try and get the sound to last a little longer to get a bit more ""doomier"" feeling to it. Maybe some plugins can help with achieve that?

Like I said, I know jack shit about these things, nor the proper English terms for any of it, so this probably isn't very helpful. I'm just a vocalist who shrieks and growls when needed."
"What does my doom tone need?","How are you recording your guitar? Are you using any type of interface or are you literally using 'line in'? If you're running like a 1/4"" cable from your amp to your computer's 1/8"" mic in, that is probably the culprit. Especially if you're using active pickups. 

However, if you're running your guitar directly into your computer, I'm actually pretty impressed. I used to do that and I found that my guitar sounded fuzzy."
"What does my doom tone need?","Nope I've got a pre amp but basically yeah the unprocessed signal gets thrown straight onto Audacity. I took everyone's advice here though and redid everything with it, it sounds unrecognizable. Good EQ and compression, and some ambience VST's can come pretty close to making up for having an awful DAW haha."
"What does my doom tone need?","Mids are your friend. Some more mids in your guitar (maybe just a tad more bass too) will fatten it up significantly while still allowing it to cut through. More mids will make those chugs sound way bigger too. Cutting mids on a bass is a mortal sin in my opinion as well. 

One question, what are the chords being played between the quick melodic licks in the intro? My ear is bad at deciphering distorted non-power chords still.

Cool riffs though, I really enjoy this.

"
"What does my doom tone need?","Tuned to C (I think?) so here's a tab for the bottom two strings.


    F   5-7---7---7---7---7---7---7---7-
    C   ----0-8---8---4---4---3---3---3-

    F   5-7---7---7---7---7---3---3---3-
    C   ----0-8---8---3---3---1---1---1-

So C is the tonal center the whole time the way I hear it. The intervals in the chords would be a major third down, a minor sixth down, a major sixth down, and then of course a power chord on C#, the minor 2nd in the scale of C."
"What does my doom tone need?","I like the progression a lot. Thanks!"
"What does my doom tone need?","And is everything mixed well etc? Thanks."
"What does my doom tone need?","Pretty cool! I just think when you play the chugging type part it could use more low end, but not so much that it makes the instruments muddy. Just a tiny bit more. Kind of the same thing with the whole song. Some suggestions for achieving those kinds of sounds would be to turn the tone knob down on the bass, turn down the treble a little bit and the bass up on your amp (also do not scoop mids. Seriously first mistake any metalhead makes when EQing), use the bridge humbucker on your guitar. I'm actually pretty curious what gear you use."
"What does my doom tone need?","Less bass, more mids, play the riff 4x times (not copy/paste) 70% left, 70% right, 100% left, 100% right

Play the riff twice somewhat clean &amp; twice the way you have it. When you blend it all together it'll sound sick. "
"What does my doom tone need?","Thanks. I quad tracked this. Twice with a muddy and grungy distortion and twice with a gnarly and scratchier heavy distortion. One of each got panned to the left and right, but on one side the gnarly one got a high shelf and on the other the muddier one got a high shelf. Also on each side one was panned 100% and the other like 70% but idr which ones got which. You're saying what I should do though, is record two tracks with distortion and two tracks with a cleaner tone? And should the high shelf always be on the outside and bigger tones more near center?"
"What does my doom tone need?","Yeah man, the clear tone will make your tone sound unreal. Keep the cleaner tones at 70% pan. "
"What does my doom tone need?","And the distorted ones 100% L/R should be the high shelf? Should they be as loud as the other ones or quieter?"
"What does my doom tone need?","Check out this video: http://youtu.be/L6PHzkPjH7c

It goes over those details"
"What does my doom tone need?","lol someone just posted this in this subreddit recently. I did take your advice on the center tones, I got an Iron Horse distortion going in on low dist and high tone mid level volume, it's cleanish but the chugs are tight as fuck, then I just put the gnarly stuff on the outside, it just sounds like one big slab of doom!"
"What does my doom tone need?","I like the mixing, I'm not a big fan of the snare. I think you need a looser, more ""thud"" like sound to it."
"What does my doom tone need?","Sounds sweet."
"What does my doom tone need?","I think the bass could be alittle bit tigher and more defined, but that's about it."
"What does my doom tone need?","I actually think you could make it a bit more loose.  Add some more bass, and a lot more mids.  Also, if you're thinking of buying a new pedal, maybe think about getting a phaser."
"What does my doom tone need?","You actually don't want more bass. You want to make sure you're leaving sonic space for the rest of the band. Remember that. A lot of people spend a long time chasing a bedroom tone and then find that it doesn't work in a band setting. "
"What does my doom tone need?","Well, that could mean a lot of things though. It could mean a more audible bass, or a smoother bass. It could mean more bass frequencies or a louder bass guitar. I think I've successfully made the bass better after re-working it. It is more noticeable and easier to follow, and blends well with the guitars without sacrificing rumble and good old fashioned doominess."

"How to get the edge?","My band is going to a battle of the bands Feb. 1st and I wanted to know what really sets a band apart in those kind of shows. Our average age is 18. We know our shit very good but I just wanted to know if there's anything else except being tight and stage presence. 
\m/"
"How to get the edge?","Don't stand there and look bored or stare at the cables on the floor. Look like you're having fun, and once in a while pretend you recognize someone in the audience. That'll get you laid, too."
"How to get the edge?","1. Be awesome
2. Don't suck.

Some tips though that helped me out in battle of the bands. Some may call this cheating but whatever.

Show up early for soundcheck, find the sound guy and make friends with him. Do what he says, don't dick around and they'll more often than not make you sound good. 

Don't go ""Oh, I can't hear my guitar, better turn it up!"" you might not be able to hear it but trust me, everyone else can and if you change that then you mess up his mix.

Engage the audience. This might be more down to the vocalist (not sure what member you are). If you're playing more than one song, inbetween songs the singer should be the ONLY thing you hear.

After every song have a quick run through your tuners.

Act professional like you've done this a million times. But not in a dicky ""Where is my water I asked for, servant?!"" kind of way. But y'know, minding your Ps and Qs.

NEVER play over your allotted time. You got 30 minutes? Your song list should be 20 minutes.

Overall, HAVE FUN. If you're not enjoying your time on stage then something is wrong."
"How to get the edge?","
This shit right here.
Exactly. 


Also, In addition to making friends with the sound guy, if you have a good gig and it sounds great, tip the guy. They never get enough credit for what they do. "
"How to get the edge?","Very helpful thanks! "
"How to get the edge?","BotBs are 99.99999% of the time determined by crowd response, participation, and numbers. You have to hold the biggest, most entertained crowd during your set to even be looked at. They're not judging on anything that really has anything to do with your musicianship, and if they do, it's a negligible percent of your score. So basically, bring as MANY PEOPLE as you can, and tell them to go ape shit. As douchey as this sounds (especially if the prize is something worth a damn), you can ask them to leave after your set so they don't fluff up the crowd for other competitors. Some even go off pre sale ticket numbers alone, so if you aren't the top seller, your set doesn't even matter. A lot of douchebag ""promotion"" companies solicit these pre sale type shows for bands that aren't doing much on their own (it's borderline a scam). Just be weary. Don't make battles the only shows you book."
"How to get the edge?","Holy shit thats heartbreaking. So many talented bands probably went unnoticed for this reason. Thats probably why shitty -core bands were being signed up by the dozens..."
"How to get the edge?","Ya, it isn't like every cheesy band movie where the whole point of the movie is to prepare for this fantastic, dreamy battle of the bands. Then, upon winning, you sign a trillion dollar record contract and go on a headlining world tour immediately. But in reality, it does make goods business sense to fuck with bands that pull energetic, consistent crowds instead of the world's fastest band that bores normal folk. A lot of metal is doomed to be nothing more than musician's music, especially when you get into shit that has whacky tempo and signature changes for no good reason other than, ""look, we can all stay in sync in eleventy/twelve timing."" That's the thing, though; the first thing a band should decide is whether the music is for the fans, or for their own satisfaction."
"How to get the edge?","They key to getting big in the metal scene is to have super groovy music and to put as much energy into the crowd as you want out. My band is by absolutely no means big but we have music that is inviting to move to (16-30's love this) and put a decent stage show on. Maybe 5% of the population of my town listens to metal or anything that could be remotely considered metal, but people like us because we look like we are having fun and we make people want to move. I live in a small hick town where everyone is either a wangster or a hick who listens to country, I have seen some of the most thugged out as well as some of the most rednecked kids in the town, dead center of the pits. It is a really cool thing to see."
"How to get the edge?","Ya, I live in the same type of area. It's funny, I have a friend that is a straight beer drinking, overall wearing, truck driving hick, but listens to straight up fucking metal. He'll always go the hardest in the pit. I love seeing people like that, completely destroying their stereotypes."
"How to get the edge?","Its always fun to see stereotypes ruined!"
"How to get the edge?","[deleted]"
"How to get the edge?","How is it being judged? Did you have to pre-sell tickets?

If it is based on crowd reaction then if you play last you have the best chance because most of the people at the end were to see you. Likewise if you play first then you have almost no chance to win.
"
"How to get the edge?","No pre-sale. It's just a simple battle of the bands but it could launch our name across the province (literally) and hopefully get more fans. 
"
"How to get the edge?","Good luck! 

Like someone else said, don't just stand there a stare at the floor or your fretboard. Try to talk to the crowd but don't over do it with terrible banter. 

Act/play like you've been there before and already won."

"my bands (...But A Thought) first play through/music video, please give me some [feedback]","Processing on the clean vocals is nice, (maybe a little too much at some points, but it's your sound) the screams seem a little... unpolished, like all the effort went into the cleans and you just didn't bother with the harsher parts, so you may wish to do something about that.  

Instrumentally, I can tell the bass was doing a lot of cool stuff, but I couldn't hear it very well most of the time, so maybe bring it up a bit.

Cinematically, I think the key to good presentation is energy, which was a little lacking.  On the other hand, I've never made one of these before, so maybe I don't know.  It is a pretty cool song though, I'd be interested in hearing more."
"my bands (...But A Thought) first play through/music video, please give me some [feedback]","This is pretty cool stuff. The bass is a little light in the mix. 

Your vocalist might benefit from more close-ups on the face, as the shots of her from farther away detract from the energy in the video IMO. At that distance, with the shot only taking up a quarter of the viewable area, it just gives the video a weird vibe of sorts.

That said, the music is quite good, I dig it!"

"my bands (...But A Thought) first play through/music video, please give me some [feedback]","Dude, your guitarist has an awesome Carvin!

About the video, I found it really awkward when she was standing there looking down while screaming. I think she lacked a lot of energy that really didn't fit the more extreme parts of the song. I also feel like the screaming vocals could've used a bit more processing to bring them out in the mix.

Cool and unique songwriting though, thanks for sharing!"

There's a stab at it. It's flubby and there are part I'm going to change, but it's something to start with. I imported the track into reaper at 175 bpm, but kicked it up to 190. There's a drum-only track on there too. I'm new to recording, so let me know if the mix sucks. "
"What sub is best for collaboration?","Man that was the shit! Oh god I'm about to jam out tomorrow. I may need to actually go out and buy a bass because I can see this being a fun little project. 

I just listened through it real quick before hopping in the shower so I just played it through my phone. So I'll just worry about mixing later, right now I gotta worry about practicing! Gotta get them palm mutes to sync with the double pedal, then we'll be talking. "
"What sub is best for collaboration?","Right on. The guitar work seems pretty dang tight, so if anything isn't syncing, it could be the drums. 

One thing that I can't figure out is how to get my ride cymbal to 'ping' loud enough to hear for blasts. I only have two cymbal pads, so I'm fairly limited. I plan on grabbing a third soonish though. "
"What sub is best for collaboration?","Okay I actually do have something to ask of you. In terms of mixing, I actually like the sound a lot, but I was wondering if you can make the kick drum pop just a little bit more? It already sounds really good tone wise, it's just behind the mix a bit. If you can raise it, and may EQ it a little, if that's possible, it will be perfect. I can worry about how it sits in the mix with everything else later. "
"What sub is best for collaboration?","Yea, I noticed the same thing when I played it on different speakers than my computer's. I think lowering the low end and kicking up the highs of the kick drum might help it punch through. I'll take a crack at it after work. "

"What sub is best for collaboration?","Ha, yeah. I used to borrow a friends' bass but his older brother took all their basses when he moved out. Which is stupid, because no one in that family plays bass anyways. 

At the closest pawnshop near me though, they have a really sick looking 5-string for 100. I want to get it, but I'm currently having my cash sapped from me and my job just notified me that theyll be docking basically $200 from me, so I'm not happy about that at all.

"Free reviews of your release (4 Tracks or more)","Hi, myself and a friend run a small music promotion group and are going to review the first 50 submissions we get (not just from this sub).

Basically we're both musicians/producers ourselves so we know how important a bit of praise or constructive criticism can be to a musician, especially if your stuff isn't getting much love elsewhere. With that in mind, we are going to be honest with our reviews, so if you're not confident in your release, don't send it.

All the reviews will be posted on http://a-5tar.tumblr.com"
"Free reviews of your release (4 Tracks or more)","I make progressive rock/metal-type stuff, ranging from clean &amp; melodic to heavy &amp; intense.  I would love for you guys to give it a listen!

"Could I get some constructive criticism on this demo track?",""
"Could I get some constructive criticism on this demo track?","but on the description of the song you say not to criticize it :|"
"Could I get some constructive criticism on this demo track?","I was just joking when I wrote the description, I really want to get better at mixing/mastering which is why I posted it here. Also, any and all comments on the musicality are very welcome. "
"Could I get some constructive criticism on this demo track?","I dunno man, I like black metal, especially raw stuff.  the only think that kinda bugged me was the vocals felt like they sat more on my left.  I'll give it another listen but if you were going for raw you got it haha."
"Could I get some constructive criticism on this demo track?","It's nice and atmospheric- feels like it could fit well into a movie or game cinematic. It flows well and, without the ""Hail Satans"" would be something I'd want to download and throw into a mellow playlist for studying or reading to. Hell, even with them, it's fine up until near the end where they get more obvious and legible. 

It's somewhat generic, as you said, but I feel like it's well done enough to not really matter. 

"
"Could I get some constructive criticism on this demo track?","The drums sound way too ""plush"", and they are too uniform. I don't mean just the volume - everything about the attack screams of MIDI.  The snare attack should be far more aggressive, and the bass drum sounds like someone patting their leg with their hand. Try samples of real metal drummers instead. It is sparse enough you could do magic with it.

The rest of it sounds pretty cool, like it could have been lifted from a movie soundtrack."
"Could I get some constructive criticism on this demo track?","Yea, I'm using the default garageband drum samples, so no matter what the drums aren't gonna have that same raw quality as the rest of the song. Do you know if there's anywhere where I could get some better samples for free? "
"Could I get some constructive criticism on this demo track?","There are many sample based instruments for Garage Band. I just googled ""garage band drum kits"" and found way more than I knew existed."
"Could I get some constructive criticism on this demo track?","Drum intro seems a little too long, it sounds kinda empty. Maybe some ambient sound could help. The drum timing isn't ""sloppy"" enough, I think you could use the ""humanize"" function. The atmosphere is quite cool, but the reverb sounds a little too...metallic. Try convolution reverb, there's a free one that comes with Reaper. Panning the vocal left is kinda odd, but I think it works, in fact it's quite cool. The riff is good too."
"Back with another tone test (Sorry, I know). Feedback is appreciated.","So after getting my new interface and hooking it up to Windows, I decided to follow the settings in this video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6PHzkPjH7c), and achieved this new tone: https://soundcloud.com/haaris-sohail/scarlett-2i2-multi-track-metal-test. Tell me what you guys think about it!"
"Back with another tone test (Sorry, I know). Feedback is appreciated.","My two biggest critiques of your tone would be: 


1) Cut the lows and pump up the mids. Your tone is very heavy on the low end, which is okay when it is by itself. However, in a full mix, your tone would be burying the bass guitar while failing to cut through the mix as a whole (due to a lack of mids). 


2) Be careful when quad tracking. In the example you posted, the quad tracked guitars are quite a bit off between the right and left. Granted, I'm wearing headphones and you only made a tone test. To me, there is almost a 'perfect' echo or mimicry between the right and the left, so maybe it's an issue with latency or something instead (I hear the right note and the corresponding left guitar note is delayed almost in perfect halves). 



Even though that video recommends a Low-Pass Filter around 16k (interestingly, I think that is high for rhythm guitars; I'd say a better range is between 9k and 14k), I would have guessed that your sound had a very low Low-Pass Filter. Not sure what is going on there, but it could just be due to a lack of mids and highs dialed in. Look at the guitar track in [""Take This Life""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdtp-Y2DuPU) by In Flames, for example. I'm not a fan of the tone there but you can see how relatively high and thin it is by itself. "
"My band just released our first Demo EP. Be awesome if you could check it out. 7 string, heavy thrash?","As the title says, my band just released our first EP. As far as the genre goes i always thought of it as heavy thrash, although im sure other's will disagree. Sounds a bit like Ola Englund's Feared band at times.

It was all done ourselves. Recorded, mixed, mastered etc by myself. Drums were programmed using EzDrummer and the Metal Machine expansion kit. So if you have any questions/criticisms i'd love to hear them! Hope you enjoy.

"My band just released our first Demo EP. Be awesome if you could check it out. 7 string, heavy thrash?","Dig it. Sounds more Soulfly/Sepultura than Megadeth (thrash-wise). I'd like to hear where you go from here, I started following you on Soundcloud! \m/

Criticisms

This is totally superficial as I haven't listened to everything thoroughly: I love the intro to Perdition but when the bass comes in it sounds a little off time on the second bar (I think!) just slightly. And the clean guitars almost melt into the distortion, it would be nice if the mix made room for the clean here with some EQ automation maybe.

Keep rockin man!"
"My band just released our first Demo EP. Be awesome if you could check it out. 7 string, heavy thrash?","First of all cheers for checking us out! I never really thought about the sepultura style in the music, can see what you mean at times.

Thanks for the feedback. We came into it thinking of it as demo so the playing is often far from perfect haha just wanted something we can use to start to get our name out there! As for the clean section i never really thought of it being quiet tbh, i guess once you listen to a song over and over again you start to get used to how everything sounds. If we re record it with real drums ill definitely take that into consideration.

Thanks again!"
"My band just released our first Demo EP. Be awesome if you could check it out. 7 string, heavy thrash?","Wow, it *is* heavy.

I've listened to the first two and the last tracks. The first two tracks sounded a bit unmelodic, maybe because the few melodies are in the lower range of the guitar and it makes them less prominent. Perdition was much more melodic, especially the chorus. I like the overall sound, keep up the good work!

edit: I've just listened to Nefarious, it's kinda post metal-ish, I love it!"
"My band just released our first Demo EP. Be awesome if you could check it out. 7 string, heavy thrash?","Thanks for taking the time to listen! I'm gonna take your surprise at it being heavy as a good thing? haha My writing style never really focus's too much on melody, usually just mess about with riffs and see what comes out to be honest. Hoping now we got a full band finally that the song writing process will become more of a band effort, rather than me by myself. Will probably see more leads/melody in future releases.

I am definitely a fan of some post metal so there would have definitely been a post metal influence on Nefarious! Was the first track we collaborated on some 3 years ago when i would have been listening to a lot of it. Glad you liked it, its one of our favourites too! Unfortunately for our vocalist haha

Cheers again for the listen!"

"One man bands! How do you deal with the urge to make other genres?","Like the title says.. I am at the moment pretty tired of listening to metal (sorry) and I've found myself drawn to other genres and I am seeing a pattern. While I might not be a true metal head in that sense, I still have a vision for my groove metal project. So how do you guys do it? Do you have several aliases or band names or do you just let your project become a schitzo collection of your music? And how much time and effort do you spend on discovering and learning other genres?"
"One man bands! How do you deal with the urge to make other genres?","i say just make the songs and let the critics worry about finding a genre for you to fill in."
"One man bands! How do you deal with the urge to make other genres?","Consider it a good thing that you're bored of metal at the moment and listening to other stuff. Sticking with one genre and one genre only for listening and playing tends to be sorta like genetic inbreeding--lack of new ideas causes problems. Steal everything from everywhere but the genre that you're trying to create and you'll sound like a bloody genius."
"One man bands! How do you deal with the urge to make other genres?","Just make what you feel like making at the moment. It's all you. It will find it's place in a collection if you want it to be in one. I have hundreds of songs around.  Just getting together my first ""album"" because I've found enough songs that sound like they belong together."
"One man bands! How do you deal with the urge to make other genres?","I am not a metal musician but my best friend is.

His main band is [Black Pestilence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmQ3ANuRz1Y) and they play (in his words) grimy punk rock with electronic noise, all through the devastation of black metal..

He also has another band called [The Myconid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECafe79Hrp8) .. not sure how I'd describe it ... just listen.

Lately he's really been getting into composing EDM.

He doesn't limit himself musically but he does have different ""personas"" for his different projects."
"One man bands! How do you deal with the urge to make other genres?","I think this is it right here: 
&gt; ...he does have different ""personas"" for his different projects.

Just write what's in your heart. Then retrospectively decide how and where it belongs and in what ""persona"". Unless you're bound by contract there's no reason to constrain yourself or stifle your creativity under false dichotomies of what you *should* be making."
"One man bands! How do you deal with the urge to make other genres?","The big pro of being a one man band is that you can do whatever you feel like. don't stress it. Just write some good shit."
"One man bands! How do you deal with the urge to make other genres?","I'm am going to make a space themed ska black metal song...Don't ask how or why but I will because I can. After that I want to make a straight black metal song, followed by some thrash...just anything I want.

"
"One man bands! How do you deal with the urge to make other genres?","I just make different projects. I've got my story-themed concept album metal project, my funeral/Gothic/sad doom project, and my stonery metal project. Outside of metal, I play around with writing voice+guitar blues-folk-rock songs, and then I do a bunch of silly songs.

But yeah, make a different persona or just have one persona for everything. "
"One man bands! How do you deal with the urge to make other genres?","To answer your question, my musical outlet is immensely fulfilling because there's no limitations to the elements I can incorporate into it.
ORCumentary has straight forward and heavy, melodic, upbeat, and melancholy songs. Everything i've written has worked. Currently i've put out two albums and an EP in the 7+ years i've been doing this and i'm working on another album now (shooting for a late 2014-early 2015 release).

(Check out ""ORCumentary Goblin Death March"" on youtube. You won't regret it).

My next challenge is to either make an acoustic/mellow version of one of my songs or write a song (not an interlude) that's strictly acoustic/mellow. One of the new songs i'm working on also has garage rock elements."
"Epic and very atmospheric instrumental song by my project, Neutron Star",""
"Epic and very atmospheric instrumental song by my project, Neutron Star","Wow, the part around 3:17 really grabbed my attention, took a while to build up to that stage but I guess that was the intention. You could try randomizing the velocity of the drum hits a bit, for example the ride and hi hat, because every time one of those drums is hit it sounds the exact same. It would sound more ""real"" if every hit sounded a bit different. Good structure for a long song, it held my attention. I'm not sure the ""modern"" sounding staccato breakdown parts work too well with the atmosphere of the rest of the song, maybe some Emperor or Opeth style riffs would fit better instead. Overall good job on a very ambitious song!"

"The absolute bare bones first track off my friend and I's demo. I just thought a starting point would be good to share.",""
"The absolute bare bones first track off my friend and I's demo. I just thought a starting point would be good to share.","Here's some pros and cons for you:

Pros: 

* Riffs are good
* I like the lead section at the end

Cons:

* Not enough variety in the riffs.  I feel like I only heard two riffs for the first 3:45 of the song.
* Drums are bit boring, though it's a demo so maybe they're a machine or purposefully done just to maintain pacing/timing.

This should probably be a 3:30 song instead of almost 6 minutes unless you work new riffs in there.  I'm not saying you should go all out and like never repeat riffs like Protest the Hero is wont to do, but a little more variety would make this song a lot better.  For comparison [here's a song](https://soundcloud.com/yeltsinstwelfthliver/malltropolis) from my band's demo that's about the same length.  Maybe it's just me but I get bored playing the same riffs all the time so I'm constantly changing it up.

Also I'm curious what the song structure is... seems like it's verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/solo and then it just sort of ends.
"

Your right about the drums, its DFH and it was used mostly as a metronome.

"Hoping to get some feedback on my death metal band!","Don't let your drummer go anywhwere.

As long as your guitarists can cleanly pull off live what they've got recorded here, you're gold in that department as well.

Bass, no criticisms other than I'd probably actually like a higher presence in the mix. I think the kicks are punchy enough where it wouldn't muddle anything for competing frequencies.

Vocals are servicable if unspectacular. The cadences accentuate the song. The lack of variation in pitch and tambre make it less than outstanding, though there's enough going in the rest of the arrangement as to not draw fault.

Overall, very solid. 8.5/10, and I'm not even a death metal guy (anymore). Rock on!"

"[Crust Metal] ""Shriveled and Sterile"" - Drums, guitars, bass, vox, mixing by me. Slowest song off my upcoming solo crust EP. Two other previews in the link, too.","I listened to a couple of the other tracks, and I liked them more. If you played the songs a little tighter, and focused on a slightly better production, I think you'd have a decent release.  Using only one guitar track really hurts the production. I think if you recorded two guitar tracks and panned them, you'd have a better, punchier recording. "
"[Crust Metal] ""Shriveled and Sterile"" - Drums, guitars, bass, vox, mixing by me. Slowest song off my upcoming solo crust EP. Two other previews in the link, too.","Thanks.  I agree on all counts.  I didn't double track the guitar and I intentionally didn't feel particularly compelled to fix the burden of various small mistakes all over the place...it's a crust EP.   This is a rough mix though, the final version will have somewhat better production.

In fact I'm a little miffed that I decided to record this with such a sterile studio setup cause it makes it hard to achieve a nice cohesive, hazy grind sound, and I have to play perfectly since the instruments have a lot of clarity.  That's not really in the spirit of crust/grind.  Don't have much of a choice as a solo musician though."

"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","..and he still wants to use it.... -_- some backstory is somebody got really mad at him and spray painted the shit out of his kit and then smashed it with a bowling ball after he left it dumped in a pile on his drive way after having some personal problems and hitting a low patch with his SO (which is another problem in it of itself, they constantly fight while we try to practice together, and she has attacked his kit on numerous occasions) and he salvaged some of it and said he wants to record a demo with this kit.... I was absolutely horrified (im the guitarist if that matters) and told him he at least needs to get a new 16' china, a 18' crash, a 10' and a 12' tom, and new bass drum because all he has right now is a snare, a trashed bass drum, an old ride, and his old hi hats. He did buy some new double bass trigger pedals but what good are they doing with that mess of a bass drum it doesn't even have a front head... (We are a metal band by the way) But anyways he keeps saying his kit is fine and even wants to use it for gigs... Yeah that's right, HE WANTS TO PLAY GIGS WITH HIS BOWLING BALL SMASHED DRUM KIT!! And also he wants to record drum tracks with it even though I have the means to program the drums with him perfectly fine he absolutely refuses. My question is have I done all I can with him? Is this a lost cause with him because he's a very good friend of mine but he's being ridiculous and I'm very serious about music. Do you guys have any advice for me to help him get back on track and thinking straight?

TL;DR: My friend who's the drummer in my band's kit got vandalized and he wants to use his beyond bare bones destroyed kit for shows and recording, how can I help him see the light that it's beyond saving?"
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","Record his drumming .. play it back to him.

When he hears how shite he sounds he'll change his mind."
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","Have you ever seen American Idol auditions? People are not good at judging themselves. People are even worse at admitting they are shit at something they've dedicated time to. This will never work. He will think it sounds fine; just like he currently thinks it sounds fine. "
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","That's... That actually would work I bet, when he finally hears it for himself outside of all the noise while jamming he'll finally see what I mean. Thanks!"
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","Another thing you can do: Blend his performance with quantatized drum samples, and use that, so you have his playing, reinforced by samples from a better kit."
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","And I forgot to mention the sad part of this was that his kit was a nice sized one: Three different sized crashes, two different sized splashes, three mounted toms and a floor tom, a 22' ride, hi hats, and two bass drums."
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","What sort of kit did he have, and what do you expect him to replace it with? A good drum kit is expensive, can easily rack up to the same cost as a custom-built guitar, unless you want to opt for a smaller kit or for a worse built kit.

Can you give a list of what shells are at least less-than-partially damaged? What cymbals are not destroyed?"
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","Also if he knows who did it and has evidence,he can sue for destruction if private property"
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","He actually didn't even care that much when it happened. He even knows exactly who did it."
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","Just playing devils advocate, and I hope I'm wrong, but maybe he's using this an excuse to quit.  "
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","No he does genuinely love playing music and now he says its his last chance because he says he's going to join the air force to set his life straight unless we manage to get signed to a label in two months but he wants me to do a whole demo from scratch in two weeks."
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","What does he think getting signed to a label is going to change in his life? Especially in the state of today's music industry? While there are exceptions, If you guys think there is magically a pile of money thrown at you, you are going to be greatly disappointed. Being on a label gives you access to distribution and marketing, as well as potential gigs with labelmates, if you are lucky. In the old days, the label would front the money for recording and production costs and recoup it from royalties and other revenue streams, These days, with the ability to get professional quality on a lower budget, they often expect you to present them with a finished product you've funded on your own. Regardless, until you hit stratospheric record sales, any money to be made comes from your live performances. 

Even after being signed, the reality is most musicians still have to work a day job to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. And this is not something new, this has always been this way. This is especially true in metal. Did you ever say to yourself ""Why isn't my [favorite band] coming to my city"" or ""Why are they only doing 12 shows?"" The answer is they have to coordinate the time out of their day-to-day lives, front a certain amount of money for travel prep and schedule the shows with as little downtime as possible so at the very least they don't lose money by going on the road.

While I'm not saying it can't happen, the two month window is an extremely unrealistic expectation with no obvious benefit beyond personal satisfaction. In the end it isn't a miracle cure for what is affecting your drummer.

"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","Oh I know I won't be rich if I choose music as my occupation and I already knew most of what you said. I told him if by some divine miracle we were to get signed we'd have to have our songs down like the back of our hands and he hasn't even listened to any of the material and actually told me to rewrite all of it without even hearing any of it. I try and tell him this takes serious work, I personally love the challenge, but he says all the time not to worry because we can just ""do it"" and our music will be good. While I have faith we have the potential to be very good musicians, music just isn't like that."
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","In all honesty, this arrangement sounds futile, and draining. It's incredibly difficult, but I've had to pull out of an 8-year project with a good friend because despite the strength of the material, it became clear that he did not have realistic goals or expectations, and was basically undermining our progress by not getting real. It's better to be serious about music first, and friends second, from my experience. YMMV."
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","Again, not trying to be a dick, but those are some pretty rigid boundaries being imposed on any success. "

"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","Wow. Dude, run.

Use EZDrummer with Metal foundry for the demo. You need a literal miracle for a record deal, and if your drummer goes off right after you're getting contacted, you're fucked. Rather be straight with it and say you don't have a drummer than risk entering a record deal you can't fulfill."
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","How fucked are the shells and rims?  If the damage is mostly cosmetic, and the rims aren't too bent to hold a tuning it might not be insurmountable.  "
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","They're pretty bent up in some spots, he lost all 16 of his tuning keys too"
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","If you can still stand to play with him, maybe just look into replacing the rims and heads.    If they hold a tuning you should be fine, and it's a hell of a lot cheaper than buying a whole new kit.  "
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","Anytime a band mate has told me that I *need* to do something regarding my gear, I've never been inclined to listen.  I *need* to turn down the gain?  Well guess what!  The HM-2 is going up to 11!  I *need* to start playing solos?  Well too bad because the top two strings are coming off my guitar!  I *need* to move around more on stage?  I'm playing the next show sitting down!  Now on the other hand, if they *ask* me and are willing to have a conversation instead of just barking orders at me, then I'll probably listen and reach a compromise."
"My bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...","Oh I only told him he needs to do those things because he told me, and I've written his drum parts and my guitar parts and baisically the bass parts too, that I need to rewrite and record our demo (he said it was to hard to work with, yeah he can only play to chug riffs and constant power chords) in two weeks otherwise he's giving up on music, actually he said he wants to do the whole demo in one night so if he doesn't do those things then he can leave the band. I gave him the option of programmed drums until his kit is back up to speed but he refuses and I want this demo to get us attention, possibly sign us with a label if we work hard enough on it, at least I know I have."

"Are lyrics welcomed here? Here is an entire albums worth.","So I am working on an album, this is the first undertaking of this scale that I have done. The genre is Grind/Doom metal and the album is WW1 themed. This is the order in which I wrote them, some songs are just over 2 min and some will be longer. There is a supernatural aspect that I want to expand on with more albums. I posted a demo version of the first song a while ago but I didn't have the rest of it written yet. So without farther delay, I present The Forlorn Odyssey.
P.S. the formatting is all fucky.


[Into the Grinder]

Over the trench,
into the gas.
Bodies lie exposed,
rotting and bloated.

Miles of wasteland,
twisted hunks of metal.
Dead eye stares pierce the night,
A bullet to the head ends your fight.

Into the grinder,
Into the grinder.

[For the Cattle]

They say only the dead know the end of war,
but in this eternal battle the dead still wage on.

Arisen from the mud,
washed in the blood of the dead.

Time to rejoin the fight,
time is neither day or night.
In this hell you cannot end,
doomed to die and die again.

Trapped on this eternal field of battle,
flesh and bones, food for the cattle.


[No One but the Dead]

Welcome to the front lines,
you bed is made from corpses.
You sleep with the rats,
the stench of death suffocates.

Drowned in the mud,
a bullet to the head.
Keep your wits about you,
or you'll wind up dead.

Into the bog, filled with bodies and blood,
down into hell, if you make a wrong step.
shelled from above,
grinded from afar.
You're a statistic in the news,
a casualty of war.

Gaze upon the field,
filled with our remains.
Overran in minutes,
there's no one but the dead.


[The Oncoming Storm]

Flares illuminate the sky,
burning bright as daylight.
Hit the dirt,
or catch a bullet.

The light fades to darkness,
keep crawling forward.
Fear not the stray round,
for when death chooses you
you will never be found.

In the land no man calls home,
where blood has stained the dirt.
The mud is filled with fallen brothers,
metal barbs shred your skin.

Without warning,
the lead rains down.
There is no cover,
from the oncoming storm.


[Born of War]

As I sit inside my wretched trench,
my hatred for humanity grows unchecked.
The sleepless nights and gore filled days,
have withered my spirit into nothing.
War has worn away my soul,
I hold no hope for mankind's future.

I am born of war,
the embodiment of misanthropy.
A vessel for the hatred of man,
let death flow from my hands.

I have awakened from the deep,
my only goal is the destruction of humanity.
By war and famine, by pestilence and plague,
all will fall under my insanity.


[The Curse of Man]

Within seconds all my friends are dead.
Men I have know since childhood.
I am all alone in the earthen crater,
a contorted corpse screaming in silence.

I hear the whistle of a falling shell.
I have no time to react.
I enjoy my last moment of earth.
I think back to my home.

What black magic exists,
that allows me to live.
I remain in my body,
given a chance to relive/give.

Am I immune to the curse of man?
To walk with death and not feel his touch.
I have awakened to my immortality,
I will show no mercy to my enemies.


[Among the Dead]

I haunt these barren trenches,
Where men once told tales of home.
Nothing remains but bones and mud,
shattered dreams and hope forgone.
On this silent field I found myself,
among the din and horror of war.
An ethereal wight beyond times reach,
a guardian for the men of light.

I am immortal.
I am eternal.
I will turn the tide of war,
I will fight against the horde.
Until the last shot is fired,
I will be here among the dead.

One man cannot change the future,
but I am not a man.
I am death incarnate,
I will bring doom and ruin.
Forced to walk this earth alone,
I am the doomsayer

I will strangle the life from
all my enemies.
Hear my wretched call,
Before me all will fall.

[Cult of the Doomsayer]

I grant thee immunity,
from the kiss and fear of death.
Stand by my side,
watch your enemies die.

I will guide you through this war,
untouched, ungrazed by lead.
Fearless in battle,
We will rewrite history.

Only I know the truth,
of what the future holds.
We will be viewed as demons,
but the cities will fold.

Join me in the fight,
I will show you the truth .
Our future is in danger,
the savior must be stopped.

We will form this cult,
for the ones that choose to die.
Pull the strings to reveal the truth,
for the ones that choose to lie.

The future will never know another horror,
that we were forced to live.
This is our solemn vow,
with our breath we will give."
"Are lyrics welcomed here? Here is an entire albums worth.","They don't really have anything to do with WWI.  It's like you are describing a photograph from WWI that doesn't have any detail... much of what you are saying could be referencing any generic battle.

I suggest you do some research and start from scratch.  You need to elaborate on the basic ideas you have presented so far.  Look for creative ways to discuss specific WWI issues - gas attacks/masks, trench-foot, wounds/injuries, deserters/executions, fear/mental health, shellshock, military structure and ranks, misleading propaganda, the sounds/sights/smells... rather than simply referencing their existence as you have.  Maybe even go as far as researching language and colloquialism of the time/country in question to pull your listeners away from the impression that you are simply describing a photograph in 2014.

"Original prog metal recording. Feedback welcome. Antikythera - Precession.","Well that's a hell of a thang, I tell ya hwat. and I don't even like instrumental Metal all that much. Composition, riffs, leads and synths are all interesting and hold attention. Also, I must commend your mixing. I can hear absolutely everything, but it still has impact and heaviness. That said, I think you could fatten up the mix a bit and it would still work, but good job!

My only major complaint is that the drums sound programmed. I know they are, but they shouldn't sound it. I'd mess with the velocities a bit,  put accents in places; little things to make it seem human."

"Pain in wrist while playing","I've been practising Laid to Rest by Lamb of God lately, trying to get the speed up to match my drummer who plays everything about 20bpm faster than on the record.

Anyway, I do struggle with the song even at normal speed and I was playing along with the CD earlier, and on my third run through I got this weird pain in my wrist (on my fretting hand). 

I immediately stopped playing, since I don't want to fuck up my playing forever. The pain was still noticeable for maybe a minute or two after I stopped, and after that it was gone. I haven't played since, this was about three hours ago.

Is this a problem with my technique? Is it to do with the difficulty of the song and me being unaccustomed to playing at that speed? I don't want practise badly and end up screwing myself over so I'd appreciate some advice on this."
"Pain in wrist while playing","I'd suggest moving your guitar strap just to change the angle you're playing, assuming you're standing up. Are you fretting your notes way too hard? Try to ease up whatever tension you have but do give it a good break.

I had carpal tunnel in my wrist that lasted a few months and still feels funny sometimes, what helped me was changing things around when it came to my computer, the angle at which I type, hold my mouse etc.

It's not fun, hope you heal up soon!"
"Pain in wrist while playing","Thanks, I'll experiment with different angles. I don't think I'm fretting too hard but I'll keep an eye on that when I play."
"Pain in wrist while playing","Going off of Strychn9ne, your wrists and fingers should definitely be loose when playing, if your tensing up that means you need to practice it slower until you can play it more easily. When I started to encounter these problems I began to stretch my hands and wrists. This helped me A LOT.  
To stretch your four fingers put your arm out and gently pull back on the tips of your fingers toward the top of your hand and hold it for a few seconds. For your thumb, make a 'thumbs up' and gently pull back on the tip of your thumb for a few seconds.  
The third thing to do is WARM UP, this is very important because if you just jump into shredding you can do some serious harm to your wrists. You should do a warm up every time you pick up the guitar or after every hour or so (This is if your practicing some serious demanding stuff which it sounds like you are, otherwise you probably don't need to as often). I do all of these things and I haven't had a problem in a long time.  
If your doing these things and it still hurts I also agree with Strychn9ne that you should adjust your guitar's angle while standing. Practicing slowly while standing helps too because your wrist is at a very different angle when playing sitting down and is used to it that way if that's how you normally practice.  
I hope this helps! \m/"
"Pain in wrist while playing","There's some great advice here, thanks.

The stretching thing I've never done, it sounds like a pretty good idea though. I always warm up by playing something easy and gradually building up into the more complicated stuff so I don't think that's the problem.

Thanks man!"
"Pain in wrist while playing","[deleted]"
"Pain in wrist while playing","Dude. Stretch. Might seem tedious to spend 5-10 minutes doing nothing but stretching before you shred but trust me…it's worth it.

Don't get all fancy. Just YouTube some guitar player stretches and do what feels good without going too far into what feels painful.

After you've stretched I bet you'll be surprised at how much easier things get."
"Pain in wrist while playing","I feel your pain. 

I wear wristbands to help. I believe it's the pressure that helps with the tendons. Stretches before playing helps too. If you do them afterwards it wont help at all. I also make sure to always warm up with scales before playing longer than 20 minutes."
"Pain in wrist while playing","Was it this fucking Willie Adler riff towards the end of the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqgJc7DaDU4#t=182 ?

Cause even when stretching beforehand, that riff kills me after a while. I dig Willie's writing style, but holy shit, does he write some crazy stuff."
"Pain in wrist while playing","If you're talking about the 6/8 riff over the ""if there was a day I can live"" part, then yes. It's a combination of that and the main verse riff.

Also, by /far/ the hardest riff of theirs that I know is the weedly woodly riff at the end of Hourglass. That shit /tireees/ you."
"Pain in wrist while playing","Stretch and warm up. I used to have pain I'm my picking wrist and elbow because I would dive into Slayer right away. Even guys like Marty Friedman will say they had pain when they didn't warm up. 

There is a classical or flamenco guitarist who would play the first couple songs in his set at maybe half the speed (it's painful to watch) to warm up. So you can do that if scales and patterns bore you. "
"Pain in wrist while playing","For something that hasn't been mentioned, you might be gripping too hard with your thumb. The strings only really need a bit of pressure on the fret to produce sound. Try fretting as light as possible while producing a clear sound to test how hard you actually need to press and adjust to that, and if your wrist still hurts, you might have to lower the action. It'll help you play faster anyway."

"We just released our first album and now we're constantly getting messages from reviewers and radio sites wanting to promo our album. That's great and all, but they all want us to send them a free album first. Is this normal? How should we handle this?","Our album is free to stream on bandcamp, so if someone wants to review it and/or play it, it's completely available to do so. I understand why larger sites would want a physical album, since they're going to get requests from so many shitty little bands that actually sending the physical deal shows at least some level professional dedication. It just seems weird that if the site is already interested, that they'd want/demand a free physical copy before they review it. It costs an annoying amount of money to send out albums, especially internationally, and I can't help to feel that these people are just wanting free stuff. Any other bands get in this situation after a release, and any advice?

Consider me a fan! I'll be buying a copy of your album when I get paid. Does it support you guys more to buy a physical copy or just the download? Anyway, sorry I couldn't be of more assistance."
"We just released our first album and now we're constantly getting messages from reviewers and radio sites wanting to promo our album. That's great and all, but they all want us to send them a free album first. Is this normal? How should we handle this?","Glad you dig it! Any support is good support, so I'd certainly recommend the physical copy so you can get the nifty artwork and booklet. We probably profit more from downloadable purchases, but there's nothing like a physical copy for sure."
"We just released our first album and now we're constantly getting messages from reviewers and radio sites wanting to promo our album. That's great and all, but they all want us to send them a free album first. Is this normal? How should we handle this?","Wow, good question.  I don't know either but expect that's something I'll run into when my band releases an album... assuming it's any good and people are interested in it.

My own thought on this is that you should send them a free lossless digital copy and nice high-quality images of the album art, lyric sheets, band photos... essentially a ""press kit"" in a zip file.  That way they can't complain that the audio isn't high enough quality to review properly and you don't have to pay tons of shipping costs.  I suppose some could take offence and call you cheap, but I would think they'd understand that most bands aren't rich and need to be frugal, so who needs those guys anyway?"

It's mainly because of the way we organize our library of music. We still haven't caught up with the times, unfortunately. I'm pretty sure it's the same with other radio stations as well.

Consider where the request is coming from. Do their reviews include the packaging details - cover art, lyrics, etc? Do you think they will generate sales, either digital or physical, for you?

If you like the person's style, respect their reviews and think they can get your music out to people who wouldn't otherwise hear of it, then it may be worth it to send a physical copy. You can check the popularity of a site/blog a variety of ways - look for page ranks and backlinks. Check twitter followers, etc."

That's really a good point though about their time spent being more-or-less a trade in services. Thanks for the reply!"
"We just released our first album and now we're constantly getting messages from reviewers and radio sites wanting to promo our album. That's great and all, but they all want us to send them a free album first. Is this normal? How should we handle this?","I don't have any personal experience with this but here's my 2 cents for what it's worth:

- I don't think it's strange for them to request a copy of the album for free. In their minds they're providing a service to get you free promo so they want something they can use to get your music out there.

- Whenever possible, I would suggest sending a download link to the album for free. If you've got several formats available through bandcamp downloads that's the perfect way to do it so they can get whichever works best for them.

- If they absolutely need a physical copy, ask them if they'd consider sending a UPS label. Then all you have to do is drop it in a padded envelope and send it off at their expense (minus the envelope).

- If they're not willing to pay for the shipping and just have to have a physical copy (for whatever reason) then it's really up to you. Take a look at what their reach is and how many potential fans you'll be reaching out to. If you decide you really want to do it and are going to pay shipping, consider requesting terms of your own before sending it off. I don't think it's too unprofessional or unrealistic to ask for x radio plays/week or some sort of cross promo online for reviews. Featured posts on popular review sites and facebook can go a long way if done correctly. It all matters on how much pull the publication has. When you're talking to Revolver magazine there's almost no question, lets send out a copy. But some college blog may not have as great an impact.

Remember that it's all up to you. It's your music and you can promote and release however you like.

Ninja Edit: You might also consider putting together a press pack for the album with a download link, band photos, and copies of the cover/album art so they can really push it. Consider newspapers - a shitty article with a great photo will likely get placed first before a great article with no photo."
"We just released our first album and now we're constantly getting messages from reviewers and radio sites wanting to promo our album. That's great and all, but they all want us to send them a free album first. Is this normal? How should we handle this?","Thanks for all the thoughts! That's a good point about asking them to send a label, kinda gauging how serious they are. It's been pretty much all really small radio/review sites with small readerships, and the messages have all been kinda boilerplate, so it's been tough to gauge if they're just browsing bandcamp every day and sending these things out en masse, wanting free stuff, or are truly interested. I'm not so worried about cost as it is just getting ripped off or copyrights stolen, or I guess just a general paranoia due to being new at all of this. I definitely like your ideas though, as they kind of 'vet' the asker to see if they're genuine or not. Thanks!"

Most of these people aren't being paid so this is their perk of the job. The problem is, few of them appreciate that every CD we give away loses us a future sale and costs something up front too. On top of that, a bunch of these sites are just vanity projects with a handful of readers.

My policy is to give physical copies only to print media, with exceptions made for online media outlets where I'm confident they have a large readership."

"Vocals FX/Mixing Help...","I'm just after a bit of help in regards to vocals. I'm after a certain sound and style akin to Nadja's ""typical"" vocal sound.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK2UEtepNHY

Kind of whimsical, sounds Reverbed and maybe has a bit of delay on it. If it helps. I'm using Reaper. Been playing around with a vocal track all morning. I can get it to sound great isolated but once I then activate the band it doesn't fit in and sounds like shit.

Any tips/ideas?"
"Vocals FX/Mixing Help...","Firstly I would add EQ and try and clean the vocal up a bit - take out bass frequencies, DeEss it, etc. Other commenters have discussed that though.

I find slight reverb is a great way to have a vocal sit in a mix better. Set up a stereo aux track and put a reverb on it. I usually keep it at 100% wet. Create a send from the vocal track to the reverb. Not a bus - a send! Now solo the reverb track and the vocal track, and on the vocal track, change how much input is going to the send (reverb) until it feels good to you. Doing this mixes the reverb with the dry signal until it sounds the best.

Then test it in the mix, and try and get it to sit right. The more reverb that is added, the more 'distant' the vocal will feel - the dryer it is, the more 'upfront'. Play around with it until it works! "
"Vocals FX/Mixing Help...","[deleted]"
"Vocals FX/Mixing Help...","As /u/microbe_fvcker pointed out, it's hard to give any targeted advice without hearing what you have so far.

How familiar are you with actual mixing techniques? Having some knowledge of good techniques will likely be the biggest help. In a nutshell, I generally only cut - as a rule. You want to make sure every instrument has a clear path for it's own sound, wherever the most defining frequency for that instrument is.

In the case of vocals, I would recommend taking and soloing the track and using a good multiband EQ plugin to zero out the track across the band. Then start and create a spike that you can sweep across the entire bandwidth range to find where the ""sweet spot"" is for the vocals - this will let you know where the other instruments need to have a sharp dip in them for the vocals to sit *in* the mix. They can then be heard without overpowering everything else volume-wise.
"
"Vocals FX/Mixing Help...","Another tip that always gets glossed over is make sure your delay and reverb sends are high passed enough so you don't get mud. 9/10 people forget to do this and wonder why their mix is getting muddy after adding effects."
"Vocals FX/Mixing Help...","Can't tell you what you're doing wrong if you don't post a clip.

My somewhat simplified chain for mixing vocals below. Don't follow this to the point, mess with it yourself. Also check both soloed first then in the mix.

(Lines in **bold** are for growl/scream vocals)

* De-ess
* **Compress to fuck** (compress 'normally')
* High-pass/Low-cut filter
* Search and destroy-type EQ cuts (usually just some mud around 200-500hz)
* Hi-shelf @ maybe 8khz to pump some air back in to it
* Add **liberal amounts of** reverb/delay. Sometimes you only need reverb.

Again this sounds like a recipe, and it is, for *my* style of mixing. But I think if you get the compression and EQ right + a touch of reverb, you're golden."

"Writing 2 guitar parts that go well together?","Hey guys. So I'm a big fan of djent/progressive death metal/deathcore, and also a beginner musician with ambitions of someday starting my own musical project. 

In the music I listen to, often there will be 2 guitar parts: one playing a heavier riff on the lowest two or three strings, and another playing a more melodic part over it on the higher strings. It sounds amazing when done well. I've tried to write similar 2-guitar songs, but I'm obviously doing something wrong, because something about it sounds... off. Like the guitars are competing rather than working together.

I've been trying to find info on this problem through Google, but I haven't turned up much. Most of what I've found has been on guitar harmonies; my impression is that guitar harmonies have the exact same rhythm on both guitars and only the note pitch varies. While no doubt useful, it doesn't teach me everything I want to know. I know I've heard 2-part songs where the guitars' rhythm was not exactly the same. Conventional wisdom dictates that the rhythm guitar plays chords while the lead guitar plays a melody, but I honestly can't think of a single band I like that has their rhythm guitar playing mostly chords. I guess it's different in metal (or at least the kinds of metal I listen to).

TL;DR: How do I write 2 guitar parts that sound good together? What rhythmic and melodic principles do I need to keep in mind? "
"Writing 2 guitar parts that go well together?","Okay so you seem to be aware of how strictly harmonic lines work, for example one riff played with the same riff a third higher. This works because each interval ends up being consonant because you specifically wrote it to be - for example guitar 1 plays C-E-F-G-A and guitar 2 plays E-G-A-B-C at the same time. All of these intervals are either minor or major 3rds which sound pleasing to pretty much everyone. 

Assume now you wish to have guitar 1 play the same thing, but guitar 2 play a completely different (rhythmically) line at the same time. You have to make sure the intervals are still consonant (for the most part) for it to sound good. Lets say guitar 1 still plays C-E-F-G-A and these are all eighth notes. If guitar 2 wants to play two quarter notes and an eighth note, you have to make sure each quarter note is consonant with the 2 eighth notes guitar 1 is playing. An acceptable solution may be G-D-E. The G makes a perfect fifth with the C and a minor third with the E, the D makes a minor third with the F and a perfect fourth with the G, and the E makes a perfect fourth with the A. 

Obviously this is much more complicated in practice, because you'll have complex lines that may not be as easy to harmonize, especially when you add complex rhythms as found in most genres of metal. Often you won't be writing in a clear cut minor or major key and you'll have to be inventive. However, the key to success is making sure the majority of the relationship between the two riffs is consonant - or at least that the important parts are. You should be able to play each individual interval one at a time and like how it sounds - if you don't, it won't sound good when you add rhythm either. "

"Writing 2 guitar parts that go well together?","Thank you for helping another struggling songwriter.  

This is thoroughly appreciated.  "
"Writing 2 guitar parts that go well together?","I suggest learning how chords are constructed, not just triads but the whole deal with 7's and higher, sus chords, etc. You should explore modes and scales after, but not before. There are many ways to write leads and harmonies. Consider techniques like counterpoint. 

And don't just narrow yourself to the guitar. Don't forget bass exists and you can use that to your full advantage. I kind of dicuss some of these points here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDTaTGAAHU"
"Writing 2 guitar parts that go well together?","I think that's most composers dilemma.  The only way to solve it is to keep trying.  You'll figure it out eventually."
"Writing 2 guitar parts that go well together?","The lower one you would probably approach more as a bassline and can even simply have it mirror the bassline itself.  It's obviously going to be a rhythmic part.  Which means it's going to need to interact well with the drums.  You'd write your ""lower"" riff with the bass and drums.  I'd even say write whatever this lower riff is on the bass first.  

Then write your melodic lead part separate from that.

Or were you trying to do a counter-melody with the lower part?  That's a bit out of my experience to explain because I've never done it."
"Writing 2 guitar parts that go well together?","&gt; my impression is that guitar harmonies have the exact same rhythm on both guitars and only the note pitch varies

No, harmony is simply the concept of multiple notes playing at once. Many harmonies played on guitar have the same rhythm for both parts but it's not necessary and it can sound pretty boring that way.

Generally speaking, you need to understand scales. Once you understand scales, and know which scale you're in, then you can build simple harmonies based on the scale. The simplest one is to do what are called ""thirds"", so-called because they include the 1st note in the scale and the 3rd - or, the 2nd and the 4th, the 3rd and the 5th, etc. The traditional Iron Maiden/Thin Lizzy stuff is basically a lead line with a 3rd harmony stacked on top. Lots of melodeath bands also use 3rds in their riffs - not typically on the bass/pedal notes but on the accented higher ones.

(A third harmony is basically the first part of a typical chord triad, so knowing your chords helps here too.)

Thirds aren't the only harmonies you can use - they're just the most obvious. You could use seconds, fourths, fifths - the only issue is that sometimes they sound dissonant, depending on where they are in the scale. That may or may not be a problem, depending on how long you play them for and what the context is.

If writing parts where the notes overlap (ie. they don't have exactly the same rhythm), you just need to consider each change in note a new harmony. If you're playing an E and a G (a 3rd, in E minor) and the G rises to an A, that's now a 4th. etc."

"Let's Talk Bass, Week I: The Bassics","Pardon the pun. Or don't.

I had an idea to start a weekly-ish post/column/thread about bass in metal music. So that's what I'm doing. I'll cover a variety of topics in this, including gear, theory, and technique. I'm going to try and be as all-inclusive as I can in terms of subgenres, but to be blunt some subgenres just don't have much happening for the bass.

For today's thread, we're going to discuss some of the basic roles of the bass in heavy metal and get the age-old debate out of the way: Plectrum (pick) or pizzicato (fingers)?

**THE ROLE OF THE BASS**

In brief, the role of the bass in metal is the same as in any other style: *groove*. What's groove? Let's back up a second. The guitar and the drums are radically different instruments both in style and in role. The guitar is primarily a melodic instrument in metal, and drums are primarily a rhythmic instrument. But they need to play together, otherwise the song falls apart.

This is where the bass comes in. The bass, to paraphrase Megadeth bassist David Ellefson, is like mortar between the bricks of guitar and drums. It holds them together. The bass is often described as not being heard, but being *felt*. That thing you feel when a bassist is playing right, *that* is groove. It's where the melody and the rhythm meet to propel a song forward.

As a demonstration of this, listen to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhxycDKlaf4). You have four legendary metal songs (""Peace Sells"" by Megadeth, ""The Trooper"" by Iron Maiden, ""Sweet Leaf"" by Black Sabbath, and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" by Metallica) being shown, first with the bass removed, then with the bass put back in.

In addition, you notice another thing the bass adds: heaviness! Without those seismic low frequencies, it's hard for a band to be heavy. Some bands have been trying to avert this with bass-heavy guitar sounds and lower tunings, which we'll get to later, but suffice to say for now that it's very difficult to cut bass out of a band completely.

**SOME WAYS TO PLAY THIS ROLE**

Heavy metal being a 40-year-old genre with subgenres out the ass, there are a lot of different ways to play bass within the context of metal and still sound good. To put it another way, there is no one way to play metal bass. There are, however, several tried-and-true styles that are good for any metal bassist to know. The ones I'll cover here include **pedaling** and **doubling**. Other styles that will get their own threads include **counterpoint** and **lead bass**.

**PEDALING** is the easiest style to learn. In order to play a pedaling bass-line, all you need is a chord sequence and a drum beat. The goal of pedaling is to lock *with the drums primarily*. The easiest way to do this is to play on each hit of the kick drum, usually on the first and third beats of a four-beat measure (we'll get into time signatures later; suffice for now that most pedaling is in ""Common Time,"" which has four beats per measure, each beat marked by a quarter-note).

Once you have established a rapport with the kick drum, you can get a bit more adventurous, playing eighth-notes and moving to different roots as the chords change. However, you are not playing a melody when you are pedaling. Pedaling is primarily rhythmic, with the harmonic element of keeping the chord present in the listener's mind.

""Color Tones"" (my term) can accentuate a good pedaling line. A Color Tone is when the bassist deviates from the root *briefly*, often in a way related to what the guitar is playing. Common intervals for a Color Tone include fifths, an octaves, minor thirds, and fourths.

Good pedaling players include [Ian Hill of Judas Priest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kOxLxTldFw) and [Tom Araya of Slayer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--0cnhEgfI0) Also Cliff Williams of ACDC.

**DOUBLING** is exactly what it sounds like: doubling the guitar riff. This is a risky technique, as the basis of your playing is not the drums, but the guitar. If you're not careful with this, you can lose the groove and end up with a sloppy-sounding song.

Good doubling players include [Cliff Burton](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCDYBbg3jk) and [John Myung](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaOsLfttcrQ).

Now, note that none of the linked bassists have used these styles exclusively. Cliff Burton, for example, does some pedaling as well as doubling, and even does a counterpoint fill in ""The Four Horsemen"". David Ellefson does a lot of doubling in Megadeth's thrashier tracks (Holy Wars). These styles are tools of how you carry out your main task of establishing groove. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide when pedaling or doubling is appropriate, or any of the other techniques I'm going to talk about later on.

**MANUAL TECHNIQUE**

You can play fingerstyle, or with a pick. There are upsides and downsides to both. I am going to speak very generally of both.

Fingerstyle generally gives a rounder attack and tone than pick-style, and in the opinions of some players is more expressive due to the increased tactility, as there's nothing between your hand and the strings. On the other hand, playing at high speeds with fingers can be difficult and exhausting, and some people find they cannot get a cutting tone with fingers.

Picks give that cutting tone thanks to the pick scraping against the string, and have other benefits as well. The consistency that fingerstyle players must learn is of less concern to pick-style players. This is also useful if you started on guitar. On the other hand, playing pick-style incorrectly can give you *severe* wrist problems, up to and including carpal tunnel syndrome. It is also very hard to get the pick-scrape out of a bass sound when using a pick.

Fingerstyle metal (and almost-metal) players include Cliff Burton, John Myung, Geddy Lee, Geezer Butler, Alex Webster, Paolo Gregoletto, Sean Malone, Steve DiGiorgio, Steve Harris, Troy Sanders, and John Paul Jones.

Pickstyle metal (and almost-metal) players include Jason Newsted, Johnny Christ, Jeff Walker, Justin Chancellor, David Ellefson, Ian Hill, John Paul Jones, Lemmy, Tatsu Mikami, Dick Lovgren, and Chris Squire (not metal, but honorable mention for a fantastic tone).

You may notice that John Paul Jones is in both lists. He uses both! You should too! That's the best!

**TLDR:** Groove.

Thanks for reading. Next week: Gear!"
"Let's Talk Bass, Week I: The Bassics","Thanks a lot for the post! As a guitarist who's been playing bass on my own recordings, I'm trying to get away from using doubling exclusively. It's nice to get clear, concise information from somebody who knows what they're doing. 


Looking forward to your future posts!"
"Let's Talk Bass, Week I: The Bassics","There's nothing wrong with doubling, as it helps give your guitar tone immensely, which is not a bad trait in metal. Although, you can always add complimentary parts to your basslines, so it got some unique elements as well as supports the guitars. "
"Let's Talk Bass, Week I: The Bassics","I'm going to go over this sort of thing later. I didn't mean to disparage doubling entirely, but relying entirely on it is more dangerous than relying entirely on pedaling, in my opinion. But of course, it is better to mix and match different styles. I'm going to get into that later when I discuss counterpoint and what I call ""mix-point""."
"Let's Talk Bass, Week I: The Bassics","Based (ha!) on what I've learned from my own recording: use a pick, your attack and therefore sound will be more consistent; use way more gain than you think you need; turn it up louder in the mix; and start weaving guitar lines around the bass. Instead of both guitar and bass playing the riff all the way through all the time, leave holes for the bass to be heard on its own, alternate riffs between left and right guitar tracks, etc. Makes for more varied dynamics, and for my ears, a more interesting song to listen to.

"Cab simulator problems in Reaper","Hey guys. I'm pretty new to music-making in general, so forgive me if I sound like an idiot. 

To create my heavy guitar tone in Reaper, I used [this guide](http://www.santoclemenzi.com/?p=839&amp;lang=en) and followed it exactly, figuring it was better to get a tone like the author's and adjust from there rather than figure out every detail of the settings for myself. Well... mostly. I held off on the cabinet simulator at first, thinking I might not need it. 

Everything was fine, but I knew the tone wasn't what I wanted, so I downloaded the same cab sim and IRs the author used, set it up the same way, and tried it out. The result was a definite improvement in tone... but now when I try to play more than one track at a time, the playback gets really glitchy and skips, slows down, etc. I used the Performance Meter and Windows Task Manager to confirm that it's a CPU problem. Disabling the cab sim on the tracks removes the problem. I guess Poulin LeCab is a CPU hog. 

My question is: what do I do about this? Is there another cab sim that works as well, but wouldn't use so much CPU? And if I'm doomed to glitchy playback when I play multiple tracks, how am I supposed to write an entire song and hear how it all sounds together? "
"Cab simulator problems in Reaper","The way i used to get around this before i upgraded my pc was to render each track as a WAV file. If you right click a track there should be an option to render as .WAV? or something similar. This will just create a wav file of the track with all the current plugins on it. That way you can disable all the plugins on the original track and just keep this new WAV file which doesn't require much CPU power at all, as its just playing an audio file. It's a bit of a pain in the ass as if you wanna make any tweaks to your tone as you gotta go back and re render it all again each time but it's somewhat of a fix. Hope this helps!"
"Cab simulator problems in Reaper","Yup, it's a pain in the ass but this is the only way to do it without upgrading your computer."
"Cab simulator problems in Reaper","Thanks! I appreciate the advice. If I can't find any way around using a lot of CPU, this will guarantee that I can move forward with my project. "
"Cab simulator problems in Reaper","Is your computer really, really old? An instance of your average impulse loader on my 2011 Macbook Pro only uses up 2-3% of CPU at most (Recabinet uses something like .5%), and they're generally designed to be low-CPU usage for precisely this reason. Make sure all the plugins have the lowest possible quality and oversampling on- if I run everything on high quality and 4-8X oversampling my computer will also start to heat up and glitch. Also quitting out of the interface for the plugins definitely helps. If you still can't run it smoothly, try replacing LeCab with NadIR from Ignite Amps and modify your latency settings in Reaper. You can go as high as 8-10% without it being too noticeable. If you STILL can't run the software in real time and don't have the money for a new computer, /u/Paulsh90 is correct that you can always render each item. 

BTW, just tangentially, there's no such thing as ""holding off"" on the cabinet simulator- it's half the guitar tone :P That's like buying a guitar but holding off on strings. You need it! Not sure if that guide recommends stacking impulses on top of one another in LeCab, but you can honestly ignore that- I usually use just one impulse of a Mesa cab with an SM57 mic and it's totally sufficient. That can also save you CPU."
"Cab simulator problems in Reaper","Thanks for the help!

&gt; there's no such thing as ""holding off"" on the cabinet simulator- it's half the guitar tone :P That's like buying a guitar but holding off on strings. You need it!

I know that now, haha. Can you tell I'm new at this?

&gt; Not sure if that guide recommends stacking impulses on top of one another in LeCab

It did, yes. 

&gt; Make sure all the plugins have the lowest possible quality and oversampling on

&gt; modify your latency settings in Reaper

How do I do these things?

Also, why do you recommend NadIR if Recabinet apparently uses so little CPU? "
"Cab simulator problems in Reaper","Because Recabinet costs $50 or so, and the new version (which has built-in Framus Cobra/5150/5150 ii/ENGL Savage amp sims) is going to be even more expensive, whereas NadIR is free. 

For the plugins, usually they'll say ""oversampling"" or ""high quality"" somewhere on them. You can also go to the far upper-right hand corner of the plugin window in Reaper and click ""UI"" and it will show you a non-fancy version of all the plugin's controls, if for some reason you have trouble finding it. 

As for Reaper's latency...it depends on a bunch of things, including whether you're using an external audio interface, what kind of interface, whether it has its own latency controls, etc. Just google ""reaper latency settings"" or something and you'll find guides on how to do it that will explain better than I can. "
"Cab simulator problems in Reaper","I switched to NadIR, and the problem is basically gone! Thank you! You're awesome!"
"Cab simulator problems in Reaper","Glad it worked! :)"
"Cab simulator problems in Reaper","LeCab glitched out on me all the time. I couldn't load a project with LeCab if I had moved the impulses or else it would crash everything. Shame because the UI and options you get with it are pretty awesome.

I use keFIR now, it's very simple and does the job pretty ok. Make sure to set the mix knob to 100%. Try that and see if it helps."

"Just a song I wrote. Any feedback is appreciated","It's cool but feels more like an ambient/EDM track that happens to have some guitar in it than a metal song. Nothing really catchy in there for me, but good production."

"Just a song I wrote. Any feedback is appreciated","I think it has potential. Like others have said though, it needs a hook or some sort of composition shift to maintain interest. Had a great intro, but definitely ""plateaued"" in interest. It's missing a defining ""lead"" element throughout. You've got the rhythm section down as well as your spacey synths for atmosphere, but no particular melody or sound to keep the song moving. Reminds me a little bit of some atmospheric metal bands out there like Atoma. Recommended for inspiration/ideas.

"Just a song I wrote. Any feedback is appreciated","Well, you sir, do not understand the music that I write. As well a person, who told that I need a guitar. Let me explain it once and for all.

The guitar or hook or any instrument *in focus* would make background instruments less noticable. And I *wanted* them to be noticed, because there are a melody line which I wrote intentionally and which I want listeners to notice. Background and rhythm instruments make this song. There are no solo part of the song, because its not a style that I chase. 

Also thanks for Atoma, its amazing. I've been looking for interesting metal for a damn long time. The snare is so damn addictive.

Im definitely going to write a hit song with a sexy hook, but not right now. Im looking for inspiration atm. And tbh, I think this song has a lot of hooky parts. At least I write a song the way I want it to hear for at least 100 times. And I can't say that there are something in this song I don't like as a music listener. "
"Just a song I wrote. Any feedback is appreciated","I think you mistook what I meant by ""hook"". A hook can be anything that grabs your attention. Didn't mean it in like, a pop song chorus hook, or even a solo. Neither of those things sound like they would fit in the context of this song. But it still feels like it's missing... something. It doesn't feel ""full"" to me. It peaks compositionally after about a minute with little variation afterwards.

I listen to a lot of atmospheric/repetitive music, but there's always something that grabs my attention when I do listen to it. Whether it's the production style, the riff that's repeating, or a sudden shift in movement or sound, etc. You've got a good baseline/theme to work from, but it doesn't feel complete to me.

Entirely subjective opinion, and you asked for ""any feedback"". That's just my 2 cents."

"Awesome Home Guitar Recording Tutorial By Periphery Guitarist!","Thought this one would be super helpful for guys and gals just starting out in this department."
"Awesome Home Guitar Recording Tutorial By Periphery Guitarist!","Except the part where he provides **completely wrong** information about input volume. You should never, ever be trying to get digital input signals to near clipping. That was true in the analog world. The equivalent of close to 0db analog is -18dbfs digital. The signal:noise ratio, even at substantially lower volumes than that, is still perfectly fine, and that's how nearly every professional records, within +-3db or so. Unless you want your guitars to sound like a Periphery record (read: squished to within an inch of their life), do not follow Misha's advice on this count. Everything else is useful for beginners, but there are better (and more methodologically sound) tutorials on this subject."
"Awesome Home Guitar Recording Tutorial By Periphery Guitarist!","By definition, there is no compression occurring if there is no clipping, so this has nothing to do with the compressed sound of his guitars, no? This makes it unnecessary advice, not bad."
"Awesome Home Guitar Recording Tutorial By Periphery Guitarist!","Well, by definition it kills almost all your headroom on the guitars, so unless you then use the fader (which he does, which again screws with the instrument sound for no reason) to bring the levels down, your entire mix also loses headroom if you balance the other instruments to that level. 

There's an entire thread on the Andy Sneap forum about this video, and everyone came to the same conclusion about this hahah. It's terrible advice. Misha is just wantonly violating the basic principles of gain staging."
"Awesome Home Guitar Recording Tutorial By Periphery Guitarist!","I would love to read the thread if you have a link handy! (cue link to ""let me google that for you"")

Thinking about it though, what you say absolutely makes sense. Since there is not much of a reason to mix so close to 0db, don't put your other instruments in danger of clipping and simply lower the gain."
"Awesome Home Guitar Recording Tutorial By Periphery Guitarist!","[Here ya go :)](http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/bar/927020-bulb-guitar-recording-tutorial.html)

Didn't mean to shoot down the thread, and it's certainly a worthwhile video for the other parts! "
"Awesome Home Guitar Recording Tutorial By Periphery Guitarist!","Thanks dude. No worries; we're here to learn."
"Awesome Home Guitar Recording Tutorial By Periphery Guitarist!","If I may ask; why again is it bad to maximise the S:N ratio? I get that headroom is the space between your absolutely pushed tone, and where it starts to clip horrendously, but as long as you're below clipping treshold, you're golden, right?

At least in a metal rhythm context, you don't need to have a massive headroom as far as I can understand, since your tone is already distorted beyond measure, where as something like pop or blues (or metal leads), headroom is really important for tonal expression. 

In the thread you liked to, with the post by ""TRUIE"", he explains doing it the bulb way pushes the DI by +18dB compared to analog recording, and that it generates DI clipping. How does that make sense, since you can (and is explained by Misha how to) detect clipping on the interface?

(Disclaimer: I'm merely self-taught, and trying to follow whatever sensical audio-engineering method is shown)"
"Awesome Home Guitar Recording Tutorial By Periphery Guitarist!","S:N ratio doesn't matter as much in the digital context. Try it: go get a distorted guitar tone and record it at close to 0dbfs (near digital clipping). Pull the fader down to -18dbfs. Take a separate track and record at -18dbfs. There isn't going to be very much difference at all in the noise floor, except you're going to be driving a cheap interface to make it sound ""hotter""- but killing every ounce of your headroom in the process. Yes, headroom matters more for other genres, but as any engineer will tell you, it still matters! And like I said earlier, unless you pull the fader down, which also is generally not a great idea, you have to drive up the other instruments to the level of the guitars, which places your entire mix at risk of sounding like Death Magnetic. 

Look at the chart TRUIE posted. +2db on a VU meter = +4 db analog = -16 digital. Misha is recording at 0. That would be +20db on the analog scale- completely off the charts. 

[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enhcve9Lblc) explains it at 2:20."
"Awesome Home Guitar Recording Tutorial By Periphery Guitarist!","Pardon, but why is pulling the fader down a bad idea as well? I thought the faders were just a ""simple"" volume control, whereas input signal is much more context sensitive to what is played, and way more suspectible to clipping.

The video was quite good at explaining why a lot of people go ""max the DI"" and why it's not relevant in a digital setting, and gives off a lot of useful tips to a non-metal context. The practice is good to follow too as far as I can see to prevent potential clipping in metal rhythm, but it's not crucial (at least not as far as I can see).

And death magnetic was an absolute disaster mixwise, to the point even a rookie like me can avoid that scenario. :D"
"Awesome Home Guitar Recording Tutorial By Periphery Guitarist!","Load an instance of Superior Drummer or something in your DAW and turn the fader down 20db, then equalize the volume level. Try it with a distorted bass tone as well, or an acoustic guitar. The volume may get lower, but you will be able to detect changes in the sound. Faders aren't side effect-free. 

But the real question you should be asking is, ""Why would you max out anything if it doesn't change the sound that much [pre-fader!] and reduces your headroom and forces you to mess with other things to compensate?"" Just leave the levels be. If you could maximize and minimize things willy-nilly, people wouldn't practice gain staging between plug-ins. But they do, because input level matters to the sound a lot, and doing weird things to your input level is silly."

I've written on these tracks for a few years now, and just recently got time to finalize them with regards to vocals. They're part of an album I'm writing, which I'll hopefully release (for free!) within the years end. Please give some honest critique, and thanks for checking out my music! :)"
"How to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?","Hi all. I'm trying to buy a used Schecter Hellraiser C1. I'm having a tough time figuring out what model they are. Mainly I'm worried abou the EMG pickups. I know the newer models come with 81TW and 89Rs. Older models come with 85s. The pickups only say EMG on them though, so I can't tell which model they are.

Also, I noticed on some models the tone knobs and floyd rose are black, and in some they're silver. Is there a way to tell by that what model or year it is?"
"How to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?","&gt;I know the newer models come with 81TW and 89Rs. Older models come with 85s.

Those are the coil split-able 81 and 85. Earlier models (mine, woot) have the standard 81 and 85, no coil split.

From the EMG faq:

&gt;you can tell the specific model by the color of the EMG logo on the face of the pickup. For example, if you have a humbucker sized pickup with a silver logo, it is an EMG-81; with a gold logo, it’s an EMG-85."
"How to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?","But see that doesn't appear to be the case. If you go to the EMG website and lookup the 85, it has the silver logo, whereas the 81 and 89 have the gold logo. Maybe it didn't used to be that way, but it is now."
"How to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?","My info is from EMG's website, so you might drop them an e-mail asking for clarification."
"How to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?","IIRC the 89 is just an 85 that allows for split coil.

Maybe you could ask the seller if it has a push pull knob which should tell you?

FWIW I've got the 89 in my Jackson with push-pull coil split.  It's not that useful, with my gear I can hardly tell the difference between split or not.  If the coil split is the sole reason you prefer this model I'd suggest trying one out if you haven't yet."
"How to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?","My main reason for wanting the 89s was that it ensures I'm getting the newest model of the C1.

So when I've found listings for the C1, I notice all these small differences, and it's hard for me to tell what model it is. There also seem to be the special and deluxe models which don't appear on the Schecter website, so I try to avoid those entirely."
"How to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?","What I would like to know is what the ""diamond series"" is all about. My C-1 Hellraiser is a diamond series, and the best I can reckon is that it's like a budget model because I came by it cheap. "
"How to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?","The diamond series means it was made in South Korea. Otherwise, it could be made in China or Indonesia. I don't know really what the difference is though."
"How to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?","Schecter originally was a custom shop. When they started producing non-custom guitars, they labeled them ""Diamond Series"". Other than that, the SGR series is their super cheap end ones, and above Diamond series you've got USA Production and Masterworks.

So really, Diamond Series just means it's not their super low-end line or their super high-end line - it's everything in between, which is like 90% of their stuff. And there is Indonesian stuff in the Diamond Series - the Demon level stuff, for instance."
"How to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?","Diamond Series really just means production line (although their super budget line, confusingly called SGR, doesn't seem to be Diamond Series) as opposed to US custom shop production models, Matserworks or custom stuff.

The Hellraiser series is roughly in line with the ESP LTD 1000-level stuff. Here's kinda the hierarchy:

SGR; Omen (followed by Omen Extreme which apparently are priced higher than Demons); Demon; Damien/Damien Elite, Stealth, and ""Retro"" which are similar quality more-or-less but different feature sets; Hellraiser, Custom (Hellraisers but fancy looking), Banshee, Blackjack, Hellraiser Hybrid, and the signature Artist models.

That's mostly based off price."
"How to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?","Thanks for the clarification! It's a C-1 Hellraiser Diamond Series that I got second hand via ebay and... well, I haven't picked up my old budget epiphone since. It's a great guitar. The best part is that it sounds *incredible* for what it is - I use a Cool Cat Metal II distortion pedal and a behringer practice amp jacked into my pc and come out with a guitar sound that is way better than I would think I could get.   

Worth every penny."
"How to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?","They're solid guitars. I've got the LTD H-1001 which is similar and kicks ass, as well as a Hellraiser C7 which is awesome. My old guitarist plays a black Hellraiser C1, it shreds and sounds great!"
"How to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?","One of the first things I noticed was how *comfortable* it was. I'm a novice to indermediate player at best, so no shredding for me... but I can do chords and drills higher up the neck with very little effort or fatigue, which is awesome... and if I ever do get good enough to learn to shred, I am sure it will be a breeze.  

With my current setup I found a tone that I really love, using tons and tons of distortion but still sounds awesome, not muddy or chunky. Love it."

"Hardware advice – getting a good guitar sound","I'm looking for opinions on an all-in-one sort of solutions like [the line 6 POD HD pro](http://www.amazon.com/Line-HD-Pro-Instrument-Headphones/dp/B00GUYAZAK/ref=sr_1_3?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424367467&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Line+6+POD+HD+pro+x#customerReviews) versus a setup with [a more basic interface](http://www.amazon.com/Avid-Track-Express-Channel-Interface/dp/B00CBU9H0G/ref=pd_cp_MI_1) and more emphasis on software for amp FX.

I don't know a whole lot about this kind of stuff and I'm trying to understand what the advantages are of the expensive all-in-one solutions to decide if it's worth spending over 3 times as much cash.

Something like the Line 6 POD HD Pro is in my budget, but just because I can doesn't mean I should. If I go with a cheaper interface I'll probably dedicate the rest of the budget I'm working with right now towards a new guitar.

Pretty much any information/opinions on the pros/cons of these different setups – or even a completely different setup suggestion – would be great! Thanks guys

Edit: also, for anybody who supports a basic interface + software, what software would you recommend for amp sounds?"
"Hardware advice – getting a good guitar sound","The Pods, you can gig with. Software, not so much.

You can get amps and cabs of equal or higher quality to the Pods as freeware these days. But the other effects... choice there is a bit more limited. The situation is better if you go with dedicated guitar software - eg. Revalver, Overloud, Guitar Rig, etc - but even there the array and quality of effects doesn't always match what you get in a Pod or a Boss multi-effects unit, in my opinion.

Also, software is ideal for tinkerers - there are communities of bedroom guitarists who have nothing better to do than try out each of 1000 different cabinet impulses. With something like a Pod, the selection work has mostly been done for you, as you can start from a basic preset and amend it. Again, the middle ground is the integrated guitar software suites which will sometimes give you usable presets (and sometimes not)."
"Hardware advice – getting a good guitar sound","I would in this situation consider if i would be satisfied with the tones and effects the POD provides, based on demos and perhaps trying one myself. I'd assume that the POD would have a bypass feature to send a dry signal via usb, so on top of being able to use native POD effects, you still have the option of using computer software and vst's. The POD also has the added benefit of taking some load off your computer's CPU when dealing with signal processing, which would be important if your computer specs aren't too hot. The added hardware features aren't too shabby either, though if you're strictly doing DI recording, you might not find much use for some I/O options. u/kylotan also brings a good point that the POD works well with gigs and live settings.

I think it all comes down to whether or not you feel the POD's built in software features are worth the price difference. The AVID interface and the full retail price of either Guitar Rig or Amplitude will run you about $370ish, and at the very least you'll only pay $170 for the interface if you run solely on free vst's. Can't say personally if the POD is worth spending the extra buck, as i'm indifferent to Line 6 products, so you're going to need to determine where your budget fits your needs."
"Hardware advice – getting a good guitar sound","If you're recording but not gigging, just get an interface and use free or cheap amp sims. Ignite Amps, LePou, TSE, Recabinet, and Peavey (Revalver) all make very realistic-sounding amp sim plugins. Pair these with Ignite's NadIR impulse response loader and an OwnHammer Mesa 4X12 cab impulse library for $10 you'll be good to go. 

If you're gigging and recording or just gigging, the POD is a better option for flexibility and routing options. You can't gig with a laptop. Its cabs sound awful though, so I'd buy a real cab and a Crown power amp or something to go with it. I just sold my POD for a Kemper because the amp models aren't very good either in terms of realism.

For DAWs, Reaper is unbeatable for the price imo. For interfaces, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING ENTRY-LEVEL MADE BY FOCUSRITE hahah. I cannot stress this enough. Every third post on every forum I go on is ""my scarlett 2i2 is clipping."" Mackie's Onyx Blackjack is a great choice, and I use a Roland Quad Capture. "
"Hardware advice – getting a good guitar sound","i'm just recording, but i use logic pro x, do you happen to know if all the amp sims you're referring me to are mac-compatible?"
"Hardware advice – getting a good guitar sound","Yes. I work on a MacBook Pro."
"Hardware advice – getting a good guitar sound","sweet, i'll look into them. i'm not familiar with using an impulse response loader, could you explain what it is/how it's used?

thanks so much btw! this is really helpful"
"Hardware advice – getting a good guitar sound","No prob! [This should help.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfh_ZkyZtwg) 

The short version: an impulse response is a .wav file that somebody has created using a real amp and cabinet. It simulates the specific sound of a microphone(s) capturing the sound of a cab and power amp. All the amp sims I listed are just that- simulations of the amp itself, not the cab. The file itself is tiny, no more than a few kb and just a short click noise. You put this file in an impulse loader program (again, I highly recommend NadIR) and it completes your guitar tone by adding the cab and power amp coloration.

So your chain looks like this:

Guitar --&gt; interface --&gt; raw sound of the guitar straight into a new track in your audio workstation, like ProTools or Reaper --&gt; digital signal chain as effects inserts on the track, which usually consists of a noise gate, tube screamer pedal sim, amp sim, and impulse loader with an impulse of your choice.*

*Some software (Revalver, TSE) comes with a screamer and noise gate as part of the package, and some also have an impulse loader. But if you use the Ignite Amps or LePou stuff, they do not come with these things.

"Critique my band please. Any feedback would be great!",""
"Critique my band please. Any feedback would be great!","Straight off the bat, you do not sound like Iron Maiden but that's okay, cos you do have a style.

You have a lot of lead lines, laying down that kind of ""melodic"" thing, but the rhythm part is really simple and remains pretty much the same thing throughout all of ""Demolition of the Crystal Lattice"". That's not a bad thing, one of my songs that I wrote when I was a lot younger is the same thing over and over for like 2 minutes of the song. It just seems like t's stuck between being epic leads or this super heavy grunge thing. I'm not sure whether to head bang from the waist or to jump up and down and yell.

Okay so after the solo I'm kind of bored of this song. I like the individual elements of this, I'm not sure if I'm sold on the vocalist yet, but he's definitely doing what he's doing well. But I've heard this already now and I'm ready for it to finish.


Right okay, the torch of truth. 

This is definitely more my kind of thing, but I'd have sped it up 150% and doubled up on the drumming because I'm like that. But this is good. I'm a lot more invested in where this song is going. Again, the vocalist is good I just don't know how I feel about him on top of all these lead lines. He's super heavy, but I'm not really hyped. The instruments are hyping me up, but the vocals aren't finishing me off. 

The bridge I mean, for me it's just a bit samey. I get what you're going for on the octave guitars but I'd have brought the drums back to half time and then gone into full time maybe? Or halved the length. The drum lines are very simple, and tht's fine, but I'm expecting fills that aren't there.

"Got a new 8-string, and decided to record a little demo with it! Behold, the ""Agilancer"" by What is Sleep! (fixed link)","Sure thing!  About 2 months ago, I switched over to Reaper for my DAW, and it's really amazing, considering the price.  The guitars were recorded using my POD HD, via USB.  It's the Treadplate (dual rectifier clone) with soundgate &gt; tube screamer (75% output, 0% gain) &gt; soundgate &gt; red comp &gt; Amp.  Of course, 2 guitar tracks, hard panned left/right.

Now, for the bass, I cheated.  I took one of the guitar channels, and copy/pasted it into a new track.  Then I ran the Cockos pitch shift plugin to drop it an octave, then threw an EQ on it, boosting the bass frequencies.  

Drums were done by hand using Reaper's inline midi editor, and the kit is a modified version of Frederik's Bleed Kit preset in Superior Drummer 2 Metal Foundry.

And then on the master effects channel, I'm running the FabFilter Pro-L vst plugin, using the ""Metal - Natural Loudness"" preset, with the overall volume boosted 3 dB.

All the guitars were recorded with an Agile Intrepid 8-string.  I absolutely love it, though I've got some new, heavier gauge strings on order for it, and I still need to take it in and get it completely setup."
"Got a new 8-string, and decided to record a little demo with it! Behold, the ""Agilancer"" by What is Sleep! (fixed link)","I just switched over to Reaper too(not like I really knew how to properly use any DAW to begin with), do you have any tips or tricks for someone getting started with Reaper or in general?

I'm stealing your bass idea. That never occurred to me. 

Oh, and most importantly, that song rocks. Thanks for posting it."
"Got a new 8-string, and decided to record a little demo with it! Behold, the ""Agilancer"" by What is Sleep! (fixed link)","Thanks!  I'm glad you liked the track!  Feel free to follow my SoundCloud page, as I upload stuff to it pretty frequently, and have a back catalog of demos I've done.  I'm actually working on my debut solo album ""Entrancer"", which I hope to finish later this year.

As for Reaper, the best suggestion I can offer is to play with it, record demos, and just expirement with the program.  I've spent countless hours at my computer with my axe on, just recording random stuff, and playing with the individual tracks to see what can be done with different VSTs, virtual amps, etc.  There's also a ton of tutorials (both written and video) out there, and just watching them can help you understand different aspects of the program you didn't realize were available to you.  I'm a computer enthusiest (and work as a R&amp;D lab technician), so I enjoy screwing around in reaper for hours on end, though sometimes it drives my girlfriend insane, haha."

I can post a screenshot of my settings later, but I use tse808, lepou legion, and lecab with catharsis impulses. I'm still trying to get better at mixing/mastering, but I think this is my best attempt to date. I just need to get a bass."
"Got a new 8-string, and decided to record a little demo with it! Behold, the ""Agilancer"" by What is Sleep! (fixed link)","Yeah, I think a bass track would definitely fill out the mix!  You could try some limiter plugins to help up the overall volume a bit.  I like to use FabFilter's Pro-L on the master VST chain.  Like I explained before you could make a cheater bass track using a pitch shifting plugin to drop one of your guitar tracks an octave and boost the bass frequency with the EQ on the track.

I've used the Le456 before, with LeCab and an orange cab impulse, and gotten good results for guitars.  Part of my overall tone is also the use of a tube screamer in my effects chain with the gain at zero, tone at 80%, and output at 75% to add a bit more bite to the channel before it hits the amp.  I'm also using an 8 string with passive pickups, so that definitely adds to the beef of the guitar sounds."

"Looking for some feedback on this instrumental mix","The mix is good, I think you really nailed the djent sound with the both the guitar tone and what I assume are programmed drums. The one thing I would look into would be randomizing the velocity more on the drum hits, it can make the drums feel more natural especially on the snare fills."
"Looking for some feedback on this instrumental mix","It's always people with the best productions/mixes that ask for help because they think it sucks.

Honestly it sounds great, played very well, and the tone is spot on. Btw this song is killer too. It's got a weird ambient/suspended tension which you don't hear a lot in this style of music, I think that's really cool!

Also what The Great Dissonance said about drums. Ramdomizing velocity (and even timing a bit) can help a lot. Also throwing mild reverb on top them can help. I know in this style likes very dry and up front sounds, but if you're using a drum machine you really should consider dirtying it up at least a little."
"Need advice on rehearsal equipment for a technical death metal band","Hey guys,

This is my first time getting into a technical death metal band -- lots of blast beats, double bass -- where the guitars (2 of them) are constantly in danger of getting drowned out and muddled. The other guitarist and I are both clueless about what amps/effects/PA to buy to get a reasonable live/rehearsal sound that is also practical during recording time.

As I understand I have two options to make noise:

* 1) Some kind of half-stack set up (Peavey, EVH, etc)
* 2) digital effects/amp simulation feeding into a PA

It seems like quite a few bands go for option 2) and go direct to PA. I am not a tube connoseur as I don't know the difference honestly, so 2) seems like a cheaper and way more convenient option.  We want to try to spend probably at most $1500-$3000. It seems like option 1) would be really expensive. Anyone have suggestions, recommendations, advice on how to think about this and proceed? Much appreciated."
"Need advice on rehearsal equipment for a technical death metal band","I like to use a cab simulator with real tube distortion. 

I feel the digital distortion has not yet been able to model more complex and crunchy chords when compared to tubes. Specifically I use tube distortion pedals for a couple reasons. One, they generally have only one tube. This makes it very easy and cheap to swap tubes when one gets old or I want a different tone. Secondly, I like to use effects before and after my distortion. With a classic amp head I would have to run a cable from my pedalboard to the head and then back to the board and then back to the head again. Thats way too much cable. 

For my cab sim I use a Torpedo Live. This gives me quite a bit of choices. It have something like 50 cabs, 8 mics, and 8 power amp simulations all for the price of one. I can also get the tone I want and not have to worry about the sound guy not micing my cab in a way that I like. If I ever decided to use a head, this would also function as a load box. I built a real ""cab"" with some PA speakers so that, with a power amp, I can practice and rehearse through this. I also use it as a monitor for myself in live situations. 

This part of my set up (cab sim, distortion, power amp, and PA speakers) probably costed me about $2000. It works great for me. I hope this helps point you in the right direction for you. 

"
"Need advice on rehearsal equipment for a technical death metal band","Thanks for your response!! This is useful and the kind of response I'm looking for. A couple questions if I may:

* 1) What is the point of power amp simulation on the Torpedo Live? If I understand correctly, it mimics some power amps but cannot act as a power amp itself? 
* 2) Can you recommend mixer - power amp combos?. Could two guitarists go through the same power amp and PA system (perhaps panned)?
* 3) Does your setup look something like guitar -&gt; pedalboard (including tube distortion) -&gt; Torpedo Live/cab sim -&gt; power amp -&gt; PA speakers?
* 4) What is a load box? I tried to google, but I am still confused on when you might need to use it."
"Need advice on rehearsal equipment for a technical death metal band","1) Different power tubes give a slightly different sound. for example 6L6 power tubes sound very deep while EL34 power tubes sound a lot thinner. 

2) For rehearsals I dont use a PA. I took an old Rogue (I believe that is the Musician's Friend brand) combo amp, took the pre-amp and speakers out, and put in some loudspeakers (PA speakers). It is now basically a guitar cabinet with loudspeakers. I have a power amp in my rack that powers it. Mine has two 50 watt channels (It's a Rocktron velocity 100) so I could run two guitars through it. Some have one channel. Another option I considered was getting a powered PA speaker but I like having a guitar cab so I didn't go that route. In that case you could just go; Cab sim &gt; DI &gt; PA

3) My signal chain get a little odd in the middle but I'll do my best to explain it. Keep in mind this is for live gigs.

Guitar &gt; Pedalboard &gt; a couple other rack units &gt; Torpedo Live &gt;&gt; Here I split my signal into two with a male 1/4"" to 2 female 1/4"" cord


^1 DI box &gt; Front of house 

^2 Power amp &gt; My guitar cab (this cab is not miked and is mostly used as a monitor for my self)

When I am rehearsing I just go with the second split.

4) A load box takes an amplified signal and brings it down to a line level signal (or a mic level I'm not sure which one). Since the Torpedo live is a load box this means you can send your signal through an amp head then to the Torpedo. If it was not a load box then you would have to come out of the effects send of the amp head, bypassing the power amp in the head, or you would run the risk of frying the Torpedo. This is good if you have an amp head or a power amp and want to have the sound of the power tubes. I believe a power attenuator is the same thing.

"How does one go about creating vocals that are... somewhat surround sounding? Link to examples inside.","For example:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLOVMbGv23U

there's a slight sound from morbid angel, sounds like its coming from both sides of the speakers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTiVFayC5qA

I just heard of this band, and I really dig the way his vocals sound, it feels like he doubled it somehow.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNYP-OaPhE

In this baroness song, its really sounding prominent. This might not count, maybe he is actually double tracking vocals.

The problem is when I record my vocals, it sounds all stuffed up, and I'm not sure what effects to paste to achieve that special vocal presence. "
"How does one go about creating vocals that are... somewhat surround sounding? Link to examples inside.","A little reverb will help. You could experiment with slight echoes or chorus effects, as well as mixing the vocals to both sides of the mix equally as opposed to centering them. Getting full sounding vocals isn't actually that hard, the hard part tends to be balancing between ""full"" vocals and ones that become a bit too spacey. "
"How does one go about creating vocals that are... somewhat surround sounding? Link to examples inside.","I like to multitrack vocals, pan a track mostly left and one mostly right and cut the track volume and add a bit of reverb. If you don't feel like tracking the same parts three times you could always duplicate the tracks and mess with the track delay a couple milliseconds until they're out of phase."
"How does one go about creating vocals that are... somewhat surround sounding? Link to examples inside.","Hrm... Dave's vocals in the Morbid Angel song seem to just be boosted with reverb (and maybe some compression), and the vocals in that Psychotic Waltz song sound like they've got some subtle chorus on them.  As for in the Baroness track, it's definitely some sort of reverb, especially since you can hear a little pre-delay in there (i.e. a reversed reverb effect)."
"Help and Feedback Please!","https://soundcloud.com/kyle777-1/kyles-song-mp3

So this is the first full song I've ever made.  I personally am proud of myself, but my band doesn't want to play it because they say it's unorganized and not musically correct.  What are they talking about and how does one write/organize/compose a song.  Something about music theory.

It is obviously not recorded well.  I had no bass and used guitar hero drums, which I kinda think is funny.  Recording the solo was a slaughter and doesn't mix in well at all with the other guitars.  How do you mix tracks to sound solid?  What other improvements could it use?

thanks, upvote if you reply"
"Help and Feedback Please!","100% not trying to come across as rude, make you feel bad or discourage you from playing at all. For a first song you should feel proud. 

Diversity is the key. The reason your band doesn't want to play this because it's just limiting them on what they can do. For example from a drummer preservative there's only so much he can do can do when someone is playing guitar like this. 

Also the timing is just very odd and your cord progression just don't really go anywhere. I can't explain it in musical terms very well because I'm personally self taught &amp; just pretty much know everything from ear myself. It's just not very dynamic. 

I'd highly suggest just trying to slow down, get a metronome &amp; work on just getting the timing down and not just over using the same not. It's not a bad thing to use the same note a lot. You just have to have the other elements in the song to make it work. 

Take the song [ Skeleton Christ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOV56JKiL_A) by slayer. That song just rides the same not for EVER! Still it has elements that add to make it something that stand out and give it a twist that makes it sound unique. Don't take that to literal, just off the top of my head tossing out and example. 


For you personally, I'd suggest getting guitar pro if you don't all ready have it. Get use to playing with metronome and work on your timing. I found a lot of Metallica, Judas Priest then working my way up to some Megadeath really helped improve my playing. Sometimes in order to progress you'll have to play things you might not really like, but you'll understand later on it's a build block. 


Also Maiden. Like the Aces High Cord progession is amazing. You can hum it and hear right where the vocals would line up with that! That's what you need to be making, something that works well with the entire band. 

Also, I always suggest Steve Vai

[Ten hour work out!](http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/s/steve_vai/10-hour_guitar_workout_tab.htm  ) There's also guitar pro tabs for that on Ultimate guitar. Really cool just lower the tempo. This is good for people of any level. Starts out really simple and really picks up. 


Still like I said, be proud of yourself. Just understand that you still have to tighten up. Play with as many people as you can and just keep pushing more and more. Hope that was helpful. I know it was a massive wall of text but I kinda just wanted to try to be clear &amp; stay respectful and not just tell you blind thing with no reason behind them. "

"Tips on growling?",""
"Tips on growling?","Can you provide any more info on what you're trying to achieve? There are threads on metal vocals on here all the time, you might try finding some of those for more specific advice. Regardless, I'll assume you're starting for the first time. Here's the basics as I see them:

1) Look up some breathing exercises/principles. If you're new to singing/vocals in general, the concept of breathing ""correctly"" can be weird and foreign to some people. Essentially it comes down to breathing deeply ""from the bottom up"" so your chest inflates rather than your shoulders rising. This is what people mean when they say ""breathe from your diaphragm."" It's a bit more technical than that, but that's the short of it. On the other hand, if you were in high school band or choir or whatever, you should have already been taught this, and it's probably second nature to you.

2) Just try to emulate the sounds your favorite vocalists make. It's really that simple, and you'll pick up the basics quickly. Pay attention to inflection, phrasing, and where they place vowels and consonants. Everybody has their own style, find a range and some phrasing habits that work for you!

3) Your endurance will be shit at first, but don't worry, it takes incredible amounts of practice. Your voice will get tired and scratchy, but it should NOT hurt. If you're experiencing pain, there's something up with your technique...take a break, drink some water, and try again. 

4) Drink water. Think you've had enough water? Drink more water. "
"Tips on growling?","I don't know if this is everyone, but once my throat starts getting dry, I simply cannot growl anymore.  Keep a bottle of water handy if you're on stage."
"Tips on growling?","I'm not sure why you are getting troll responses on this, but perhaps it would help if you gave more information on what you're looking for.

For instance : Do you already know how to scream / growl? Is your technique solid? Is there a particular type of growl that you'd like to be able to do? Are there tutorials you've watched that get you close to what you're looking for but need some clarification?

Otherwise some general advice : It should not hurt - ever. Use your diaphragm (not lungs) to push and control all of your air and don't do anything that leaves your throat sore or your voice hoarse. Stay hydrated and shape your tone with your mouth and tongue - just play around with it to see what you can achieve. Also make sure to do at least some basic vocal warmups.
"
"Tips on growling?","Try to do a low register kind of mumble in the back of your throat,then push it out using your diaphram.It shouldn't ever hurt though,it should be a bit like yelling tbh imo"
"Tips on growling?","Trust the sound that comes out: meaning don't get stuck trying too hard to emulate other artists or you could do permanent damage trying to strain your vcs to reach that sound."
"Tips on growling?","If it hurts too much, you are doing it wrong. Also, inhale vocals are really bad and unnatural and will guarantee you a short career as a vocalist."

"This is a song I just released yesterday. I know the production is shitty as all I have to record with are free recording software. But tell me what you think!","With some vocals and production tweaking, this has a lot of potential.  

Pros: Neat riffing. Pretty solid arrangement—parts varied enough to keep my attention for eight and a half minutes, in fact, you may have inadvertently come close to sonata allegro form. Cool time signature stuff at the beginning.

Cons: The speech clip at the beginning is so long winded that it becomes cheesy. If you MUST insert samples like this, pare them down to their most important parts. A little sloppy playing in the clean tone guitars. If you used a different guitar for these, then [presuming you actually tuned your guitar] it sounds like it either needs intonation, or you need to use heavier gauge strings, or else not fret so hard on the wound strings. 

PM me if you'd like someone to take a crack at programming some hyper realistic drums and/or tightening up your mix (others here would probably be willing as well)"
"This is a song I just released yesterday. I know the production is shitty as all I have to record with are free recording software. But tell me what you think!","Thanks for the criticism! Yeah the production is shitty because I'm using free software (audacity and hydrogen drum machine). I used one guitar for everything tuned down to drop B and its been needing an intonation fix for about a month now. My resources are limited lol. "
"This is a song I just released yesterday. I know the production is shitty as all I have to record with are free recording software. But tell me what you think!","Production/audio engineering is an entire thing unto itself, and I got really annoyed when I first started writing and recording metal because I realized that, to satisfy myself, I was going to have to learn it as a necessary evil to make any music I recorded actually listenable. But now it's my main hobby in addition to writing music. 

So with that in mind, tips:

-Ditch Audacity and download Reaper. It's a free trial that never expires (it's an honor system), but even if you buy it it's only $60. Not as many bells and whistles as Pro Tools or Logic, but plenty of pros use and love it. Watch some production tutorials like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9liitCkItJA), learn how to use a compressor and equalizer and how to master, etc. 

-Buy EZ Drummer 2 when you have the money, preferably with the Metal Machine expansion. Nothing is as good for metal drums as Toontrack products. 

-Buy a cheap Squier Mexican Jazz Bass. 

It's a bit of cash, but the sum total should run you about $300-$400 at most and you'll have some amazing tools that you can absolutely create a professional-sounding mix with. 

-As far as guitars, not sure what you used here, but you can't go wrong with the Ignite Amps and LePou stuff. Guitar &gt; audio interface &gt; noise gate plugin in Reaper &gt; any tube screamer plugin &gt; amp sim &gt; NadIR impulse loader &gt; Catharsis or Guitar Hack impulses will get you a great tone and everything I just listed (except for the interface of course) is 100% free. 

Hope that helps :) And get your intonation fixed! "
"This is a song I just released yesterday. I know the production is shitty as all I have to record with are free recording software. But tell me what you think!","I used my Jay Turser for guitars and my Dean Playmate for bass. As far as the plugins is concerned I could never get them to work so I decided to run my processor through my computer to get the sound I have now. And I'm still experimenting with Hydrogen drum machine but I'm finding that it has a bunch of different sounds to make it sound more realistic. But I'll definitely look into getting reaper and maybe try the getting the plugins to work again!

I will narrow the panning some, I believe the panning is set to the stock EZD pan settings right now. 

Bass was done with two tracks, one clean and one distorted. I've been struggling with the distorted track and I think you nailed it on the head- it takes up a lot of the guitars space. If I remember right, there is a lot of 1-2k where the pick attack is strong. I used a multipressor to smooth the picking out a bit while trying to keep the rest of the highs somewhat dynamic. The clean low signal is compressed pretty hard. 

Around what frequencies should the distorted part be sitting to cut through/around the guitar? I've been trying to get it to slide in underneath the highs of the guitars, but that may not be the best way"

Either give the guitars more treble, raise the low-pass filter, or both. 

On the bass, the distortion sounds good but is a little too click-clacky. Load up an instance of an EQ profiler (Ozone, ProQ, etc.) and take a sample of the guitar spectrum to see where there's room for the distorted bass track to breathe, then give it a nice bell boost around there. 

The kick is also buried by the bass, so make sure you've carved out an EQ notch in the bass so the kick can be heard, and if the whole song is similar to this tempo, I would sidechain-compress the bass to the kick.

Most important: Don't pan your rhythm and leads the same. Pan your rhythm hard L/R but do the leads anywhere from 60-85% or so. It will fill out the stereo spectrum and let everything breathe more easily.

Sounds really good all things considered though :)"

"Recording electric guitar with Sennheiser e 835 Performance Vocal Mic.","I'm going to start recording semi soon and I was wondering if I could decently record electric guitar with a [Sennheiser e 835 Performance Vocal Mic](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/dynamic-microphones/sennheiser-e-835-performance-vocal-mic) which my band uses for vox. I could buy a shure sm57 which would be the most optimal BUT, I'm trying to save some money and was just thinking about using the Sennheiser. Thanks "
"Recording electric guitar with Sennheiser e 835 Performance Vocal Mic.","Why dont you try it out anyway? I mean you're not wasting money trying out something you already have.

Most people do prefer the sm57 for recording instruments, though.  "
"Recording electric guitar with Sennheiser e 835 Performance Vocal Mic.","Yeah, I'll probably end up doing that. I was just curious if using the vocal mic was a complete no go."
"Recording electric guitar with Sennheiser e 835 Performance Vocal Mic.","I have the exact same mic and it works great for recording guitar. Its basically Sennheiser's equivalent of an SM58. The 57 and 58 have the exact same capsule inside, just different wind screen / pop filter things, so the vocal mic easily doubles as an instrument mic."
"Help with tone/sound?","I have been trying to get the traditional ""metalcore"" sound/tone, but I always have no idea how. The sound I want is close to [this](http://youtu.be/ULXHAiLruss). Any idea how to get a sound/tone like that?"
"Help with tone/sound?","Well first you have to tune your guitar down to Drop Q"
"Help with tone/sound?","I laughed harder at this than I should have."
"Help with tone/sound?","Peavey 5150/6505 (or clone) and 7 string or drop C is what it sounds like, to me."
"Help with tone/sound?","Yep. This, plus some form of Overdrive pedal (Ibanez/Maxon tube screamer, mxr wylde overdrive, read up on some good ones), and a noisegate (ISP decimator, Boss NS-2, mxr smart gate, etc...). It's a classic unbeatable combo for metal. "
"Help with tone/sound?","Have you tried tuning your guitar to the same tuning as that song? Tuning your guitar to drop A or so makes it sound pretty menacing, although I prefer to sick with Drop D or C.

Other than that just play with the knobs  on your amp or pedals until you get something good. The tone on your guitar should be turned up and you're obviously gonna need some gain, but it's good to experiment and try things for yourself. Good luck! :D"
"Help with tone/sound?","What kind of pedals would you recommend? I use a Gio Ibanez with a Fender Mustang that has built in effects and presets."
"Help with tone/sound?","Well I personally use an MXR Fullbore Metal distortion pedal into and MXR 10 Band EQ pedal into a Line 6 Spyder. 

I love my pedal, but I also tweak it a little bit with the equalizer and amp settings. Only recently have I been able to find a tone I really like out of the pedal. It's easy to put too much gain on it and get that Dimebag tone. 

If you have a guitar center near you I'd recommend trying out some different distortions. I do like the Fullbore metal, but it's easy to get carried away with the gain. I think it's worth giving it a try though."
"Help with tone/sound?","You could probably get closer with a free plugin than buying a pedal:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NTtJDQNyNo"
"Help with tone/sound?","You said in another comment that you have an Ibanez Gio and a Fender Mustang (I'm guessing it's a practice amp). I have a few things here I'd like to add.

1. Stock pickups for Ibanez guitars, especially lower end ones have a rather narrow tone. It's best to upgrade them with aftermarket pickups. And I personally would not buy anything from the Gio line. I recommend at least something like a RG321. Used Ibanez RG321s are a great value. But even after buying one, I would buy and install better pickups anyway. Try to find out what pickups your favorite guitarists use or find reviews on youtube.

2. Most likely you'll need to down/droptune, which requires having thick enough strings to hold string tension (you'll also have to set up the guitar for intonation and fret buzz). On my Ibanez(es), I can pull off a Drop C tuning with a 10-52 set. I recommend Ernie Ball Skinny top Heavy Bottom for a packaged off-the-shelf set. Or check out stringjoy.com to create your own set (I use 10-13-17-28-38-50 personally).

3. You'll need more than just high gain effects to pull off what I hear in that track. I hear a slight flange effect in there as well. Maybe save up and invest in one of the many multi-fx pedals available out there. I personally own a Zoom G3 and I love it. But there are other options out there such as the Line 6 POD HD300.

Now, I'm not coming in here to say that you need to go out and blow all of your money on new equipment just to sound any good. But there is a level of investment you have to reach to be above mediocre and come closer to achieving your goals as a guitarist."
"Help with tone/sound?","Damn, this is the most helpful comment I've ever seen! I've been looking into getting a Dimarzio pickup and an emg, but I don't know how to install them and guitar center's waiting list for repairs are insane (it took a month to get my strings changed one time). I should have mentioned that I also have an Epiphone Les Paul (got it used and the 12th fret is dead). It's actually the first guitar I've ever owned. "
"Help with tone/sound?","It only takes a basic understanding of electrical work to replace most pickups. Do you have a friend who does electronic/electrical work or maybe has done pickup replacements themselves? You just need to find someone who can read a wiring diagram and solder properly. 

I dunno about the Les Paul as much, as I only play Ibanez guitars since I started playing guitar again. Ibanez is quite common and popular among many modern metal bands. Les Pauls have their place also, though, just not with me."
"Help with tone/sound?","&gt; guitar center's waiting list for repairs are insane (it took a month to get my strings changed one time).

I don't know what the one near you is like, but if they're anything like the store in my town, they just outsource the repair work to a local technician. I looked up the guy and just started taking my stuff directly to him. He usually has it ready in a day or two, and does it for half the price I'd pay going through GC. If you haven't looked into that, you might want to. It'll probably save you a lot of money."
"Help with tone/sound?","If I remember right, a lot of that djent tone comes from the eq on amp; almost no lows, a good bit of mids and a lot of highs. Combine this with downtuning to A or so, and you get that weird, bouncy tone. The other big thing about that sound is the hyper aggressive noise gates."
"Help with tone/sound?","If you're looking to record that sort of sound, remember that less gain is more, especially when double-tracking :)"
"Help with tone/sound?","Pickups have a lot to do with it.

The other day I was at a get-together and I brought my Dean with hot 80's Charvel pickups. Did a little thrash shredding, then my friend plugs in his Schecter and it sounds like very newschool metal/core/postmetal whatever stuff. Very jowly and tight sound. I asked him what pickups he had and he said they were Seymour Duncans (I forgot the model name). So I can't say for sure but I think SD's will do you good for that kind of sound."
"Help with tone/sound?","Isn't the example more djent than metalcore? Metalcore to me is bands like [KSE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z_RCdgBqkI)."
"Help with tone/sound?","/u/dirge_othe_bumblebee might be right that it's a 6505, but I think it sounds squishy and dark enough to be a Rectifier. Try TSE 808 with the tone most of the way up, drive 9 o'clock, volume 2 o'clock, LePou Lecto, increase the mids and reduce the bass/depth, increase the presence to get a djentier sound. Boost 2 db around 1500 hz. If that doesn't sound right, just swap the Lecto for the Nick Crow 8505. Use a neutral-sounding impulse response like ASEM Recto or the God's Cab impulses, not Guitar Hack or Catharsis."
"Help with tone/sound?","Don't forget the bass guitar's contribution.  Meaty guitar tone on an album is usually the combination of bass and guitar.  "
"Help with tone/sound?","Is there ever any distortion for the basses? I can't really tell if there is a bass guitar unless I feel it in the song or if it's incredibly obvious (like in Feel Good Inc. By Gorillaz). [This guy](http://youtu.be/mk0x-kNIgaw) changed everything I know. "
"Help with tone/sound?","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRbZLSrrIo4 is about 30 years old.

"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Alex Webster from Cannibal Corpse. I play bass in a grind/death metal band, so the guy is one of my idols. Met after the first show they ever played in my hometown on the Kill tour. Super chill dude. His demeanor with fans is legendary and I can see why. After I got the fanboy bullshit out of the way, I asked him some techniques on 3 finger plucking, and he showed me on his water bottle how to count the timing. Since then, I took that advice to heart and read some of his books while my band was recording. I've definitely become a better bassist and can keep up note for note plucking with my guitarist at 250 bpm plus with that single bit of advice he gave me. "
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","The dude is insanely knowledgeable. I watched the making of Torture on YouTube a while back and the someone asked him the scale that some part is in and he just friggin takes off. Totally makes sense why he'd be in a band with Ron Jarzombek. I didn't realize it until I read an interview with Ron that Alex actually wrote quite a few of the parts on the Blotted Science album and ep.

The technique you're talking about, is it the accents on 1 thing? When you accent on each finger (i.e. 3* 2 1 3 2* 1 3 2 1*) I saw him mention that on an interview and started working on that. It's tough to get the hang of, but I know it'll make my plucks a lot more consistent when I finally do get it."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","He went to music school somewhere, so yeah, he knows his shit. That's the exact technique. I took away from it to quit thinking with 3 fingers and start focusing on strumming on the beat with whatever finger is handy(heh.) He also commented on wrist position, which helped me to create an even tone across all 3 fingers as, at least for me, my ring finger is not as flexible at the second joint and is shorter so it sounds different than my index and middle. From his books I learned a lot about string skipping that helped tremendously. I've incorporated his techniques into my own practice style and I'm much more confident. I'm throwing in triplet sixteenths in a riff that I couldn't do a year ago."

"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Devin Townsend. Have one of my greatest concert memories thanks to him.

I had the chance to meet him last time he came into town. He did an acoustic set at a small club before the show. What was supposed to be a two song set turned into an 8 song show just because he wanted to. Talked with him for a bit after and then he signed my copy of Deconstruction.

Later on at the show, I was on barrier and he remembered me. Looked at me, and made faces at me the entire show. Then after the set he came off the stage, straight to me, shook my hand, remembered my name and thanked me for coming and supporting him. He then went from one side of the barrier to the next thanking everyone, and then in the end came back to me and shook my hand again. Will NEVER forget that day! One of the most humble, down to earth people I've ever meet.

TL;DR Met Devin before the show. After his set, he comes down, shakes my hand, and thanks me by name. Such a fantastic person."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I've also met Devin Townsend. Coming down after shows to greet everyone seems to be a regular thing for him, and he seems to be genuinely grateful to the fans and to be doing what he's doing. In addition, I just have to add...that dude has giant hands."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Similar story. He hung out with the crowd after a show in New Zealand. Shot the shit about anything and everything. Such a humble, compassionate guy. My most prized possession is the Ziltoid shirt that he signed after on that night.

My favourite memory from the whole encounter, however, is of a man of Indian descent who happened to be wearing a shirt that read approximately: ""God is too big for one religion."" Devin noticed it and remarked that he liked the shirt. The young fellow then insisted that Devin take the shirt and they ended up swapping shirts. 

I think about that shirt sometimes and wonder if it ended up in Canada, perhaps displayed with other memories from the road. In all likelihood it probably got thrown out, but a man can dream can't he? A man can dream.

TL;DR Devin Townsend swaps shirts with a fan after a show in New Zealand."

"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Not exactly the impression I got when I met him in a urinal. He conforms to the rest of the Dublin metal scene, musicians and fans alike, which can briefly be described as not caring about music so much as street cred. How many albums and singles you own and how rare they are. Discounting anyone who's a fan of metal that isn't the obcurest of obscure, underground-est of underground as ""knuckledraggers."" In a word, hipsters. Completely hypocritical, of course: when asked his opinion on Opeth, said they're ""not that important or influential."" His most popular song, The Coffin Ships, is a blatant love letter to Opeth (accompanied by wildly out of tune singing). I could get more in depth about his lyrical content being rooted strongly in Irish nationalism/ Irish grudge against England zeitgeist. Dude is half English. Maybe he is very serious about his music, but he's not objectively aware of it. Very ""rockstar"" personality, which is understandable considering that Primordial is the  Irish metal band anyone is most likely to have even heard of. "

* Nevermore - Warrel is kind of a dick, or just really egotistical. Jeff was fun to chat with. This was big for me because I'm a huge fan.

* James (Arsis) - Weird situation for me. He was high off his ass and I don't smoke so it was just awkward for me while we were in the bus. Also note that I'm not a fan of Arsis.

* Fear Factory - Went to a bar across the street with the guys. Dino is fucking hilarious; I was crying laughing so hard. Burton was more reserved, but a pretty chill dude.

* Vitek (Decapitated) - Cool guy, but he stands out because of his death. When I found out I was really very sad since he was my age. 

I've met just about every major band that's traveled through Denver except the really big ones like Metallica and Megadeth. Feel free to ask questions about any of them. "
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Do you subscribe to /r/TouringMusicians? Your knowledge of the Denver scene could be helpful!"
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I do not. I'll check it out, thanks. "
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Awesome! I used to go to a lot of shows in Denver, usually at the Ogden or Gothic Theater. Who had the most unexpected personality once you met them out of all the bands you've encountered?"
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Same here. I love how small the Ogden is. The Fillmore is fun too.  I've only been to the Gothic a couple times."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Nice! The Gothic might actually be my favorite out of the Denver venues. I bet I would have loved the Ogden's 21+ area if I hadn't been underage at the time. Now I'll have to go check it out again whenever I'm back in Colorado."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Man I love the Gothic. I've grown fond of Marquis and Summit Hall too. Summit reminds me of the Fillmore before they banned metal. 

Most surprising? The dudes from Watain. I thought they were all shoe. I was wrong. "
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Met Dream Theater?"
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I met John briefly. He was pretty quiet."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Going to guess Myung."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","My friend and I smoked up Dave from Intronaut a while back when they were opening for Animals as Leaders. Super down to earth, and a really cool guy. "
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Met Periphery when they opened for Darkest Hour(so not all the same guys are there) talked to their bass player at the time and played Soul Calibur with them at the merch booth, been a fan ever since"
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I've met quite a few but by far my favorite was hanging out with Joel Stroetzel of Killswitch Engage the handful of times I did. He used to come to my old bands rehearsals sometimes, and occasionally we'd end up back at his parents house, and one time he even let me play his Caparisons and PRS. He's really a humble, friendly, selfless guy. 

One time I saw Porcupine Tree with him and some friends, and I went out to smoke a butt with him and when we came back inside, we ended up in a group of me, him, Brian Fair, Phil Labonte and some of the others guys from Shadows Fall/ATR. I was kind of in awe and kept my mouth shut, but they were very cool, friendly people. It's rare to not see Brian at local shows around Boston.

Besides him, my other favorite interaction was seeing Opeth in MA back in 2005 or so with the original lineup. It was like -10F outside and there were a bunch of us waiting by the bus. Mikael came out in a huge fur coat, signed autographs, was very friendly, but ran right back inside exclaiming that ""it's colder than Sweden out here!"", however, Peter Lindgren stayed and just shot the shit until everyone left. Single-handedly the most handsome man I've ever met, I've had a bit of a man-crush on him since then."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I met Nuke, the guitar player from Motograter, he came over for a jam session and smoke out with my old band. Cool dude, down to earth - in fact, so down to earth and a pleasure to hang with, that I felt ridiculous for even being a little nervous. "
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","My most recent encounter was with Bill Steer and Jeff Walker from Carcass after a show in Miami a few weeks ago. 

They were both super cool and very gracious to me and my buddy. They were about to go on the 70,000 Tons of Metal cruise and were kinda nervous about it. Really nice guys. "
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I'd be nervous about being trapped on a boat with a bunch of sweaty metal dudes too. 

Also, gotta reschedule again. Beers next week fro' shizzle, maybe during the week."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Next week sounds good to me. During the week might be problem though, I do Crossfit and Jiu-Jitsu all week. PM me your phone# if you want. "
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I met Chris Adler (Lamb of God Drummer) after one of thier shows. Actually a super cool guy. He seemed genuinely complemented that we liked his band and that we would come see thier show. He was just really chilled out and nice. 

I met the guys from Protest the Hero one year at Warped Tour, they were also awesome, I was mainly shooting the shit with Luke about guitar stuff, they signed my t-shirt that I bought and we went on our way.

Let's see, who else... Met the dudes in the Chariot twice at two different shows, Josh Scogin (singer) was a little stand offish, but the other dudes were all cool. Oh yea, met the singer from God Forbid, he seemed pretty annoyed about something, so I didn't really have much of a conversation with him."

"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","One of the last times I saw the Black Dahlia Murder, Trevor Strnad and Brian Eschbach were literally just standing next to the stage after the show so they could hi five and say thanks to everybody who came. I got a sweaty, shirtless hug from Trevor and it was the greatest day of my life"
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I met the drummer of Iced Earth a few years ago. Really nice guy. We talked about drumming for around 20 minutes."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Met the dudes from Wintersun last summer when they did the meet n greet before each show and got to listen to their soundcheck.

Super fun guys, was a little akward, but fun. Their soundcheck was awesome as well; got to hear all the samples going. Lots of fun."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Gary Holt and Rob Dukes of Exodus.  Incredibly nice dudes - both made a point to come introduce themselves and say hi when my band opened for them back in 2010.

The day before one of our Texas stops on tour last year, we ended up at the Exodus / Anthrax show in Dallas.  My singer and guitarist ran into Gary outside the venue - he recognized them and invited them onto their bus, handed them each a cup of vodka, and proceeded to get them absolutely plastered."

"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I am a close friend of Shannon Lucas of All That Remains/ Black Dahlia/ and now Battlecross. He is genuinely one of the greatest people you could ever hope to know. He graciously speaks to any fan brave enough to approach him and is all ways truly greatful to hear the praise of those folks. He is brutally honest and will always be so. I can honestly say he is one of the closest friends I have and will ever have. So if you see him don't be shy go ahead and say hello.  "
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I've met Daniel Myhr and Joachim Broden of Sabaton a few times backstage at Sonisphere and their 2010 cruise through a mutual friend and they're genuinely nice guys and a really good laugh.   
  
I also met Sam and Herman from Dragonforce a fair few times at various London bars or before/after shows and while Sam is a top bloke, Herman is a bit of an arrogant dick and even in the early days seemed to have a very high opinion of himself.  
  
Other than that, I met Power Quest many times and ended up out all night in London with them following an album launch party in about 2006, Intense, Sonata Arctica who again are all top guys and always happy to meet and chat with fans etc.  
  
The only other guy I can think of is Gavin Harper, the former guitarist of Alestorm. Met him back when they were Battleheart and he was running around bloodstock blind drunk and draped in a Scottish flag."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","Nicko McBrain lives in the Fort Laurderdale, FL area and owns a restaurant called Rock N Roll Ribs near there.

"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I hung out with Disperse for a few days in their tiny little hometown outside Krakow, Poland. Drank, smoked, jammed, went to the club, watched them practice. All of them are a bunch of great guys."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","me and my buddy hung out with all the guys of cattle decapitation... well josh was off checking out something for the majority of the night. brought a dub sac and my personal bong to the show to smoke out the band. my buddy had told me he knew travis ryan really well. travis had no idea who the fuck he was so i just start saying i need to smoke with him to save the situation and whip out my fat gourd sized bong and start packing it. after travis took us over to the van, rah (the bassist that was touring with them before monolith) comes out with some beer and procedes to drink and smoke with us and all four of us just started talking about ghost stories and shit. great dudes, and apparently we got dave so stoned he actually was playing everything slightly slower which seemed to throw josh and rah off for the first song. "
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I've been incredibly lucky in my time.

Alex Skolnick: Met him outside his tour bus after a show. He was super nice, and incredibly patient with another fella who had him sign a laughable amount of shit. We just talked gear, metal, and jazz.

Opeth: Met the band after walking out of dream theaters set while they were touring together. They were all very nice. Mikael had a cold and was coughing all over the place. I caught that cold.

Gus G: met him after the Jason Becker Not Dead Yet show, which he played last year. He was super nice, and just standing around talking about how unreal an experience playing for jason was. 

That is mostly what comes immediately to mind, although I'm sure there are more. "
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I have met Jim Sadist from Nunslaughter on two separate occasions. I am a Clevelander and they are a heavyweight death metal band, one of the first death metal bands in the country.  Jim is extremely down to earth and one of the coolest people I have met in my entire life.  He has the sickest metal vest I've ever seen and has a great sense of humor.  I met him the first time while walking down the street, he drives by in a Staples truck and jumps out to give me a Nunslaughter sticker which I still have on my guitar this day and a Hell's Headbangers compilation CD.  This was around 3.5 years ago.  A couple weeks ago at a Morbid Saint show at a local venue I met him the second time and he actually remembered meeting me the first time and I got to chat with him for a little bit."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I met Richie and Igor Cavalera when they were touring with Soulfly back in August. Didn't really get anything more than a picture with Igor, but Richie was a really nice, down-to-earth kind of guy and thanked me for buying Incite's album from him. 

I also met all of the guys in Enslaved at Amon Amarth last month. Really nice guys, didn't really get to chat since they were signing stuff, but they were nice guys."
"What metal musicians you know or have met in person and what kind of people they are?","I've met Dave Mustain, and Marty Friedman..and the whole band really back on the Youthanasia tour.  Dave was cool, he did a radio liner for us and Marty was nice, but REALLY spacey. and He's A LOT shorter than I thought, kind of a fidget, and I'm not a tall guy.   I've also met Brian Beller, the bassist for the live Deathklock,  he was super nice and approached us after his bass clinic.  I have also met Biohazzard back in 1996 as well.  Billy and bobby were the guitarists and they were really nice and signed my jeans jacket...yeah I said jeans jacket.

"My try at getting some metal together; Devourer. Not at all finished, nothing final. Give some tips, please?","Well, the riffs are killer, and that tone is heavy as fuck. it needs better mixing, just don't make it sound generic as fuck. 

also, you don't sound very well synced with your drums."
"My try at getting some metal together; Devourer. Not at all finished, nothing final. Give some tips, please?","Thanks for commenting! Agree it need better mixing (as it's not mixed at all).
Appreciate the kind words on the riffs and tone, the tone took a while to get down. I have a earlier version of the track just before this one, up on Soundcloud. The difference between the tones is striking!

The sync can be entirely blamed on me; most of the time that I've recorded everything has been early mornings or late nights, so I'm not exactly in top conditions when I record. It may also be that I can have accidentaly moved some of the tracks off-sync, it's something I'll have to go through later today."
"My try at getting some metal together; Devourer. Not at all finished, nothing final. Give some tips, please?","Yeah, there's something off with the 2 guitar channels here. Could be latency issues on one or the other chain? otherwise it could be a nudged sample.

It could also just need more tightening up to get the parts to sit right.

Tone was nice, but there was too much guitar in the mix, and not enough drum.

Nice work dude!"

"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","
Not purely related to metal, but those involved in more symphonic metal could perhaps help. So after some deliberation, i think i'm ready to add an orchestral program to my arsenal of shit i do not need. In an ideal situation, i would like to be able to make tracks would replicate the style and quality of Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia and Death Cvlt Armageddon from Dimmu Borgir (~[an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQSFpKG1les)). What i don't want is a program that emulates noticeably synthy/artificial tone, as my keyboard can already do that. Having done a little research, I've narrowed down my options to the following based on a budget of around $500, with pros and cons that i hope someone could give their own two cents.



**Native Instruments - Komplete**

I've been eyeing Komplete for a while since i've been using Rig Kontrol as my DI for guitar/bass and Guitar Rig demo for practice. I wanted to get Komplete as opposed to the standalone Kontakt (the orchestral sampler) since it not only includes what i need, but also has the full version of Guitar Rig, as well as a shit load of non metal/rock/orchestral toys i can play with. Here's the run down:

*Pros*

* Includes Kontakt, well know sampler program that works well and supports 3rd party
* Includes Guitar Rig, which would be a step up from trying to work around the 40 min demo version
* Additional programs to mess around with
* Reliable company name

*Cons*

* Costs $499, near top of my budget
* May or may not have any real use for other programs besides Kontakt and Rig, so may not be worth the money
* Vanilla sample library given not the best sounding, and may require buying third party libraries like Albion, ergo needing to spend more $$$, ergo probably be the **most expensive pathway** 

**EastWest Quantum Leap Orchestra + Choir**

EastWest really grabbed my attention, as all examples of their products sounded amazing and what i'm looking for. For my budget, im aiming at getting EWQL Orchestra(gold), though had I the money and faith in their products, the Composer's Collection would have been the best option. Right now though, if i order within the next 24 hours through Sweetwater, i have the option of adding their Choirs program, which sounds totally badass. However, there are some issues that make me hesitate to pull to trigger on their products

*Pros*

* Best sounding out of the box, what i'm looking for
* Some reviews swear by how good the program is for professional line of work
* Symphonic Choirs sounds amazing, word generator adds some realism as opposed to simple Ooh's and Ahh's

*Cons*

* Terrible reviews on reliability and Customer Support. This is the red flag that scares me. I see reviews from people who buy EWQL products (including their Composer collection, retailing around $1000) that will straight up not work. These either stem form data corruption, compatibility issues primarily with Mac's (I'm on win 7, so i may dodge that bullet), or issues with iLok (explained below).
* Uses native PLAY engine sampler. From what i understand, PLAY is very resource dependent, and may still cause issues on more powerful rigs (I'm running an Intel i7 with 12 Gb of ram, so hopefully this would be enough). Kontakt appears to be the better engine from what i hear
* Uses an iLok system. You literally have to spend an extra $50 on a ""special"" usb drive that holds your activation serial code, which needs to be plugged in order for any of their products to run. iLok not working? You're shit out of luck.

**Vienna Symphonic Library Special Edition**

VSL seems to be the middle ground between Komplete and EWQL. I haven't done as much research into them as Native Instruments or EastWest, however from what i gather they seem to be a viable third option.

*Pros*

* Samples sound realistic, comparable to EWQL
* Reputable company and product
* Possibly the cheapest option

*Cons*

* Dry samples that require a lot of processing to sound natural
* Sampler engine very technical, requires time to understand full potential
* Also uses a USB key system :(



Hopefully you've read through my great wall of text and understand the mindset i have right now on these three products. In general, if you have any information or experience with these products at all, whether it be positive or negative, please leave some feedback. However, here are some main points that i would really like addressed in order to make a sound decision

* Are the given libraries for Komplete's Kontakt at least comparable to the other programs, or will i need to dish out some more money?
* Is EastWest reliable, or are they shit? Preferably any recent interactions with the company, as they may have improved over the years.
* How resource dependent is each engine on my PC specs (Win 7, Intel i7, 12gb ram, possibly using external hard drive) solely for composition, not live playing?
* Any success in using these programs in a metal/rock track? Samples?

"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","I'm still a huge fan of Miroslav Philharmonik.  "
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","Second this! Other than the Choir the instruments sound pretty convincing to me. The learning curve is mild I think. Definitely worth checking out and adding to the list of products to review."
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","For metal though? I could never get any of the instruments to sound super intense, like a blasting horn or anything."
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","Mustis used Symphonic Orchestra, which I believe is now called EastWest Quantum Leap Orchestra + Choir. I use it and I love it. I can't say I have any experience with their support. It also uses a shit load of ram compared to the other two options you presented."
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","How much ram are you running, and do you experience any issues?"
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","8 gb ram and I don't really experience any issues until I have about 12 tracks+ running. The lag is mostly when I'm loading a new track (after 2 or so tracks). After about 12+ tracks, the computer lags when I start playing a song, but only at first. It corrects itself after a few seconds."
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","Alright, so i should be good in that regard."
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","NI Session Strings sound really good and Voxos are really great choral libraries that require very little post processing."
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","Whelp, after some last minute thinking and a little new years alcohol, i decided to take a leap... a Quantum Leap that is (buh dum, *crash*). I opted for the EastWest symphonic orchestra and choir deal, as i felt the deal was a little too good to pass up. Maybe in the future when my budget opens up i'll add other programs to my repertoire. Hopefully things will work out well. Thanks for everyone's input, if all goes well i might do a follow up on how things turned out."
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","The QL Orchestra and the QL Choir will work fine for you. Their samples are a bit old and not exactly state of the art but if you're producing metal metal then they will more than suffice. I don't think I've ever needed their customer support. iLok is a hassle but once it's set up it's done forever.

Komplete is an awesome bundle but all it offers you directly for this purpose are the bundled Kontakt libraries. The Session Strings are good - and since most of the time ""symphonic metal"" means ""metal with a string section"" you may be in luck. But if you want brass as well (or, maybe less probable, woodwind and orchestral percussion), you won't have that. Guitar Rig is nice enough but I don't think it should be your main choice for metal guitar recording, even with the Rammfire pack that comes with Komplete. Revalver is better, as is Amplitube. And there are many freeware or inexpensive VST sims that are equal to or better than these (eg. the LePou collection, or the [TSE X50](http://www.tseaudio.com/software/x50v2).)

By comparison, I have no experience with Vienna Symphonic. They are supposedly better than the EWQL samples, but maybe the special edition is cut down. I'm sure you must realise that *""Dry samples that require a lot of processing to sound natural""* doesn't really make sense. :) A dry sample is the most realistic sample - what you probably mean is that it doesn't sound like it's been recorded in a massive hall, but that's easily solved with a reverb bus and maybe careful panning. You're going to want to EQ orchestral instruments to make them sit well in a metal mix anyway so don't expect any free lunches here from any of these libraries.

Regarding resource use, samplers are cheap to run. The most important thing is that you have enough memory, which in this case means you must be running a 64-bit DAW in a 64-bit operating system. If that's not the case, you'll probably need to bounce down each track as you go, or work with less resource-intensive tracks during composition and switch to the full versions at the end (again, bouncing as you go)."
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","Thanks for the response. I can't tell you how reassuring a positive experience with QL is. With regards to Komplete, i think my main allure were the extra toys that would come besides Kontakt. I understand Guitar rig isn't the best for metal since it's a bitch dialing a decent distortion tone, and i have used LePou's amps and other free vst's, however the added effect tools and non metal amps are pretty convenient to me as a bedroom hobbyist not too concerned with solely writing metal. If anything, i may just buy their products next time they go on sale.
With VSL, you're right by what i meant with the dry samples. I think the concern i have is trying to replicate a reverb environment that would sound decent with what little tools and experience i have. This again is where i think tools from Komplete like Reflektor would come in handy.

You also mentioned QL isn't quite state of the art. Could you explain what you mean by that?"
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","&gt; I think the concern i have is trying to replicate a reverb environment that would sound decent with what little tools and experience i have. 

Pretty much any reverb plugin is going to be good enough for your purposes. Reflektor is powerful but isn't going to be significantly better than freeware alternatives and probably no easier to use either.

&gt; You also mentioned QL isn't quite state of the art. Could you explain what you mean by that?

The samples are old, the way you use them is not as versatile as others (eg. there's no ability to map different velocities to different articulations), and newer libraries might have more articulations and more samples per articulation, making them sound a bit more realistic (though that will be the least of your troubles when getting to grips with orchestral scoring on a computer)."
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","I was in a similar position and bought komplete. I am incredibly happy with it."
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","What lead to your decision? Also, have had any experience with any 3rd party developers that use kontakt?"
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","[Symphobia 2](https://www.projectsam.com/Products/Symphobia-Series/1390). I use this more than any other orchestral library. It's on every track of my [demo album](http://Bretheren.bandcamp.com) for reference."
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","ProjectSAM definitely popped up a lot in my search, and while Symphobia really sounds impressive, it's currently outside my budget. BTW, really dig the AOE track."
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","Thanks man! They also have [Orchestral Essentials](https://www.projectsam.com/Products/Essentials-Series/1446) which is samples from Symphobia with some fat trimmed for cheaper. But I see you already made up your mind! EastWest is great as well, and honestly most of these libraries all sound good if you know how to use them properly! Good luck to you man"
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","I have used both the Kontakt Factory Library and the East West Orchestra.

The Kontakt samples aren't quite as high quality and there aren't as many variations on the sounds for certain instruments, but it's far easier to use regarding MIDI control and simplification in general. The sounds are also easier to fit into a mix of other VST's or audio, especially in something like a metal track. 

The East West samples are very nice sounding on their own but I find it more difficult to work with them. They have a lot of reverb on the samples and are pre panned to fit in the space they were recorded in with the other instruments. These are much harder to fit into a metal track because of how beefy and room-oriented they are. These sounds offer very little for customization. I really like the way East-West sounds in an exclusively orchestral setting, but it's overkill for any other mixes really. 

Personally I'd go with Komplete because Guitar Rig is worth it for any metal musician, and the orchestral sounds are still very nice. Not to mention the other plugins and cool stuff it comes with. 

Edit: Did not notice you already with with East West. Still a good choice. :)"
"Any Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?","I still wouldn't mind getting komplete some time in the future, just not at full retail price. Seeing how NI doesn't tend to give it discounts, i'll probably wait for an occasional price cut of Guitar Rig, then cross grade when i have money to waste."

"Need help improving my speed/technique (Guitar)","I am in need of exercises or songs to help me improve my speed. My aim is to be able to play tech death such as Necrophagist, Cannibal Corpse, Aborted and Obscura by the end of the year and I'm really struggling to keep up. I'm not entirely sure what the problems are with my technique, but I think it is partly down to my finger dexterity and coordination between my picking hand and my fretting hand. Any exercises or songs which you give me to help me improve are greatly appreciated! Even better would be some kind of ideas for a practice regime as I would like to have that but don't know where to start. Thanks!"
"Need help improving my speed/technique (Guitar)","scales. Use a metronome. Start slow, then gradually speed up. Then when you master playing a scale from top to bottom and vise versa in ridiculous fast speeds, learn how to do different patterns of that scale like arpeggios, random intervals, etc.
"
"Need help improving my speed/technique (Guitar)","Would it be a good idea to start with major, minor, the modes, diminished etc and then move onto other scales and their modes?    How much time do you think I should dedicate to scales? "
"Need help improving my speed/technique (Guitar)","It doesn't matter as much what the specific scales are IMO - just try to mix it up a little with them. I would also recommend doing the scales with different fingering combinations. IE, start with 1234, then 1324, 1342, etc. This will also train all your fingers to be used on demand.

Always focus on cleanliness too. Have good pick and muting control and try to fret with as little pressure as you can to get the note clean.
"
"Need help improving my speed/technique (Guitar)","it depends on you. the major and minor scales are pretty much building blocks in music. In metal, the harmonic minor and pentatonic minor are standard. Find a scale that most of your favorite bands use (most likely its harmonic minor) and learn off that. But learning other scales is just as important for finger dexterity. "
"Need help improving my speed/technique (Guitar)","Just practice playing those songs at slower tempos. Itll keep you interested in playing, while also helping your technique. Metronomes are good but also try playing along with the song slowed down. Playing scales over and over until you think you're fast enough will suck the enjoyment out of playing pretty fast. "

"New song I've been working on, fast, sorta thrashy, melodic harmonized guitars... check it out!","Really sick riffs, man. If someone had told me ""Hey this is a Battlecross track without the vocals"" I would believe it. I thought the very ""punky"" middle section was a nice change too. 


Also, I listened to some of your old stuff posted 15 days ago. If that was really created 15 days ago compared to now, your production skills have also increased a ton in a very short time period. Either way, you're very talented. Keep at it!"
"New song I've been working on, fast, sorta thrashy, melodic harmonized guitars... check it out!","Thank you, I appreciate the feedback! And yeah, if it was the 'progmetal' song you were listening to, I was using superior drummer 2.0 which I'm still new to and it's harder to get a good sound out of. I also just started messing with Ozone for mastering on these last two tracks, so they're much louder as well. Thanks again!"
"New song I've been working on, fast, sorta thrashy, melodic harmonized guitars... check it out!","Nice. I'm a thrash guy myself, but I haven't gotten a kickass tone like that. How'd you get such a tone?"
"New song I've been working on, fast, sorta thrashy, melodic harmonized guitars... check it out!","I'm using a POD HD500 for the guitar tone, and the bass is programmed in Trilian. 

The patch on the POD is a combo of the JCM800 (for an aggressive midrange) and Fireball (for brutal distortion) amp models. Then there's an overdrive and noise suppressor in front. In my DAW I high-passed the guitars to around 80-100Hz. There might be another noise suppressor at the end of the chain, and I think there's an additional EQ in the amps' FX loop. 

The bass has a lot to do with it as well. Like I said before, I'm using Trilian and the ""picked bass"" samples. I put some distortion on it using the free TSE Audio BOD bass overdrive (TSE makes some badass free VSTs, would recommend for sure). The mids are pushed up a good amount, as well are the bass frequencies around 80-100Hz. 

Then in Ozone, I set the 'harmonic exciter' to around 60-70% and that seemed to add a lot of depth to the bass sound as well. 

Hope that helps some!"
"New song I've been working on, fast, sorta thrashy, melodic harmonized guitars... check it out!","Yeah, that definitely helps. Wish I had the money for a POD 500. 

Right now, though, I've got a single POD Studio GX running into a Mac, with my guitar running into the GX. I've got a decent thrash tone (TSE 808 + Nick Crow 8505 + Poulin LeCab v2), but I can't seem to get the fuzziness out of my tone. Would you recommend using a DI box to smoothen the tone?"
"New song I've been working on, fast, sorta thrashy, melodic harmonized guitars... check it out!","I don't really have any experience with DI boxes, so I wouldn't want to recommend anything and not have it work. 

Only thing I could really suggest would be to try some different EQ techniques, hi/low-pass filters, surgical cuts to hi-mids... And just keep fiddling with the amp and overdrive settings. The TSE X50 is also another 5150 modeled amp that's free and sounds good, with the other VSTs you have I'd guess you've probably used it though. "

"Let's Talk Bass, Week VI: Lead Bass!","Welcome back to what is, for now, the last installment of this series. This is the last and what should be the most interesting topic to cover, that of ""lead bass."" This can mean a variety of things. I'm going to divide into three subtopics: *Bass Runs*, *Bass Fills* and *Bass Soloing*. They can overlap, but dividing them should help me work with the individual intricacies of them better.

A **Bass Run** is essentially a trade from whatever regular line you're playing to something a bit flashy and usually more melodic. To get a better idea of what a bass run is, take a listen to the one, the only, the king (in my opinion) of the bass run....John Deacon!

Bet you didn't see that one coming. If you don't know, John Deacon was the bassist for rock band Queen. He played on all of their albums, and had a distinctly funky, Motown-like approach to both his songwriting and his basslines. For a great example, listen to the first Queen hit he wrote, [""You're my Best Friend.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN_HVup9oOg&amp;noredirect=1). Put on some headphones, 'cause Deacon is using a P with flats. A quintessential sound, but not one that can be heard well on shitty computer speakers. From this alone we can get some ideas of how bass runs work.

First off, there's an undeniable improvisational element to it. At the last, it has to feel improvised, in a way. This doesn't mean you shouldn't practice bass runs, but rather you should practice a variety of runs, so you can throw them into a line without thinking about it for longer than a second.

Secondly, the run always ends back on the root of the chord. This is important for maintaining consonance; you want to end on a perfectly consonant interval, usually the root of the next chord. As an aside to this, notice that the run never goes over the bar division. If you count it out, in fact, the first bass run Deacon does is in two beats. That's it. It doesn't have to be very flashy at all.

A **Bass Fill** is very similar to a run, but has a bit more freedom to it. Usually, as I define it, the bass is the primary instrument of a fill for a bar, maybe two, but usually just a bar. Fills can be [simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=oasnbzEMV08#t=189) or [tricky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=wO0ikbGvIY0#t=250), or even [trading with drum fills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=LdpMpfp-J_I#t=98). The idea is to keep the groove while adding your own flavor to fill out the sound, since the bass is on its own during one of these sections. You can have a lot of fun with these, but remember to keep the groove. If the song has to pick back up after your fill, you are not keeping the groove. Keep the counter in your head.

Lastly, a **Bass Solo** is longer and more elaborate than either of these. A bass solo can be its own solo spot in a show or in a song, or even a track of its own. Depending on this context, you need to approach bass soloing differently.

The band should not always drop out for the bass solo, but they sometimes can, and depending on how much the band is playing, that can affect your choices when soloing. I'm going to further subdivide bass solos into *Comped*, *Semi-Comped*, and *Un-comped*. (Comp is short for accompany, referring to whether other instruments are doing during one instrumentalist's solo.)

*Comped* solos are when the band is playing behind the solo. Most guitar solos are comped. Some comped bass solos can be found in Trivium's [""Becoming the Dragon""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=3rSfGtLzshc#t=229), Metallica's [""Or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMJhOwBLqw#t=102)[ion""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMJhOwBLqw#t=395) (two links there for two solos), and Bad Salad's [""The Second Calling""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrulOZV3uY4#t=471).

As you can hear, many of these solos are very guitar-like in their phrasing. This is because with the band comping you (notice how in the Trivium song the guitars are playing a slower riff centered around their low B and locked with the drummer), you actually don't have to maintain the groove. You still need to play in time like a guitarist playing a solo, but you have a bit more freedom. As you can see in the video, Paolo uses some Van Halen-esque tapping techniques to start his solo, Cliff makes whole phrases out of hammer-ons and pull-offs, and Felipe uses some double-stops and simple melodies. These are all viable techniques to use, as well as slap-and-pop and simple fingerpicking.

*Semi-comped* solos have an accompaniment, but not as much as a fully comped solo. This can refer to a solo that has a staccato, ""in-and-out"" backing, as in [Metropolis Pt 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaQpC4HuJ5M#t=343) or [""The Dance of Eternity""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B1KVGJm1jw#t=186), both by Dream Theater, or with fewer instruments, as in Rush's [""La Villa Strangiato""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=UNilsLf6eW4#t=369) where the guitar drops out and only the drums accompany the bass.

This is similar to a comped solo, but the bass is a bit more restricted in options. You can't be as guitaristic on the bass in a semi-comped solo. The Dance of Eternity is about as guitar-like as you should be getting, and notice that he still has some groove in it. It's still distinctly a bass solo. Notice that in Strangiato, Geddy stays very firmly in the groove even while soloing. If nobody else is playing except the drums, lock with the drums and groove the solo. Don't be intimidated by the need to groove; it can make your solo more memorable if it's melodic and groovy.

Finally, *Un-comped Solos* are true solos, where the bass is everything. This is most commonly done as a solo spot during a show, but can also be an album track. [Cliff 'Em All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O9zMnwD65Q&amp;noredirect=1) has some of the best examples of these bass solos. They don't necessarily groove, but something like ""Anesthesia"" is too Baroque-feeling to need to groove. It can be a welcome respite, too. Another example of this kind of bass solo is [Jason Newsted's solo on Cunning Stunts.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wfllKiTthw)

Lastly, here are two good examples of how NOT to do an un-comped bass solo. [Gene Simmons of KISS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUVpPtBeD2g) and [Cronos of Venom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN3JKXTj7gw).

That's all. This is all I can teach, as far as I know. The rest is up to your own experimentation. Find a good teacher (not a guitar teacher, a bass teacher), find a band, and most of all, GROOVE! Ask me any questions you may have.

My old Ibanez Smash Box was my favorite distortion pedal, but those seemed delicate - I went through two of them with normal use, the pedal's on/off switch would just stop working.

"What are some good pedals for metal.","If you want a really tight sound that's on par with Periphery's style you'll usually start out with a compressor to give the playing more cut and to round out the top/bottom of the noise, a general noise-suppresor (ISP Decimator) to get the mud out, any tube screamer, another noise suppressor with a noise-gate in it for snappy silences (NS-2) and a delay (which I usually set to work basically like a chorus pedal without the wonkyness for a more full sound). I can't get myself to like  heavy distortion without refinement, even if it's not for technical metal. Clear beefiness. "
"What are some good pedals for metal.","As a new owner of a 6505+/mesa cab half stack this posts gets exactly to the pedals I might personally need. Thanks!"
"What are some good pedals for metal.","Not sure if there's a flair of mine saying I own exactly those 2 pieces (I'm on mobile) or just coincidence. They are rock solid. "
"What are some good pedals for metal.","Wow, pure coincidence. Don't see the flair."
"What are some good pedals for metal.","Boss HM2s are pretty common.  There are a couple of different specs depending upon where they were built, and Lone Wolf Audio has a pedal (I think it's called the left hand wrath) that combines several of the most popular in one box."
"What are some good pedals for metal.","&gt; Boss HM2s are pretty common.

In Sweden.

In the 90s."
"What are some good pedals for metal.","Hahaha, yup!"
"What are some good pedals for metal.","Some of their tones was simply a marshall tube amp being overdriven.  So an overdrive pedal will likely be your ticket.

Especially Slayer and Death.  Go to a guitar center, take the bc rich stealth chuck model and plug it into a marshall and you got his tone right away."
"What are some good pedals for metal.","If the amp being used is decent, you'll want to keep your signal chain simple. Ibanez Tube screamers (ts 9/808) are generally used to give a slight boost/crunch to the guitar signal to help drive the amp a little harder. They also do an excellent job of doing classic overdrive tones for blues and classic rock. Prices range from around $100 for newer/cheaper models, to around $300 for older/boutique/modded models. Other pedals to consider are noise gates (isp decimator) to reduce feedback noise/hiss, and a compressor for evening the signal.

If the amp isn't too hot, or lacks decent gain and drive, i would then look into distortion pedals. I have a Digitech Hardwire TL-2 that go for about $100, and i've been really satisfied with it. It features true bypass, high and low gain, mid gain and frequency sweep (something alot of cheaper distortion pedals lack), distortion gain, and a tight/loose switch for different distortion. It also looks pretty sexy and has a game changing blue LED light.
I've heard some good things about Electro Harmonix's Metal muff as well as Blackstar's HT-Distortion (uses an actual tube) for classic metal, though i haven't tried them myself. I have, however given the MXR Fullbore a try, but preferred the TL-2 over it since i found the distortion not to my taste. It does feature a built in noise gate feature that is really nifty, so it's worth a thought.

Finally, i would recommend against alot of gimmicky/cheap looking pedals. Specifically Digitech Death Metal, Metal Master, Grunge^why_did_i_buy_this , Boss's Metal Core, Metal Zone, and any shitty brands like Behringer. Their features and distortion are less than ideal, and are aimed at suckering beginners and uneducated with their low prices. The only exception would be if the pedal was modded (I believe Cannibal Corpse use a Keely Modded Boss Metal Zone), but at that point you're probably paying outside your budget. 
"
"What are some good pedals for metal.","I like the Electro-Harmonix Metal Muff."
"What are some good pedals for metal.","Good distortion is a lot easier to get from the amp, maybe with a booster pedal (I use a DOD YJM distortion for a solo boost only), than with a distortion pedal. Every distortion pedal I've used into a clean amp I've hated the sound of. Honestly just have him get a cheap multi-pedal like the Digitech RP series and save up for either a nice amp or a nicer multi-pedal later on"
"What are some good pedals for metal.","HM2 for entombed/trendy hardcore infused stuff, anything else and amp distortion channels are probably your best bet"
"What are some good pedals for metal.","The two that keep coming up here and that you will actually see everywhere else are the Boss HM-2 Distortion and the TS808 Tube Screamer. There are other good distortion pedals, and Boss seems to be pretty popular with metalheads (I've never owned anything besides an HM-2 but I hear good things about the DS series.) There are always lesser known brands making good stuff though. I own an Iron Horse by Walrus Audio, and it sounds as gnarly as an HM-2, but it's kinda like that blended with a doomy Electric Wizard or QOTSA fuzz. 

l also have an MXR Carbon Copy for analogue delay. Not a metal specific pedal but it's a good thing to own in general. Same one High on Fire uses."

"Where else do you promote your music?","Topic says it all.

When I really want to get something out there, I can usually do a good job and expect a hundred hits or so within the first day, but after that, activity calms down. I noticed some people (usually bands) get significantly more followers or listeners on soundcloud. Do you have any advice for this sort of thing?

Right now I'm just a bedroom musician but my band &amp; solo project will have a albums out in a few months. Do you think actual bands tend to get more hits? Also where else do you post link to new material? This sub is usually my first stop, but I also like to go to other metal forums or Ultimate Guitar and share my work. I try to comment on other's music a lot too, to get people interacting, and hopefully others return the favor. Once I have an actual bandcamp page up, I'll be putting it in all my forum signatures and probably go to /r/metal and a few other places to just promote music. I'll submit to Last.fm, Pandora, and youtube etc. I'm wondering what else you guys can suggest as far as DIY digital promotion goes. Thanks.

P.S. Another idea is to give digital copies of my work to those underground bloggers that post download links to metal albums. Anybody have a list of some that haven't really been blocked/have a lot of followers? I don't intend on making it rich with these projects so the next best thing is just get a bunch of people to pirate it haha."
"Where else do you promote your music?","Start putting together press releases and hammering the blogs that cover your style of music.  Don't expect the big ones to give you the time of day.  Write personal emails to the blogs you dig, and don't just copy paste the same thing to everyone.  Mention something about their blog that you like so they know you've actually read it, and aren't just trying to glean any and all press you can.  This has been pretty successful for my band.  Another thing we've done that helps is to send your biggest supporters freebies.  If you have merch and a bandcamp page, send stickers to anyone who's ever paid for your stuff.  About two years ago my band put together a mailing list of everyone who paid for our stuff (even though it was free) and sent them each five stickers with a note asking them to hand them out to their friends or post them up at venues around town.  People loved it, and fans will always be stoked on free shit.  Stickers are essentially cheap marketing, so never make anyone pay for them, and give them out liberally.  "
"Where else do you promote your music?","Excellent! Good sticker manufacturers?"
"Where else do you promote your music?","We've been using 123stickers.com, which is the cheapest high-quality stuff we've found thus far.   "
"Where else do you promote your music?","I'm extremely interested in the answers to these questions myself. Also, fuck it, lets start here: check out my deathgrind side project and I'll check your shit out!
 
http://burdensofmisanthropy.bandcamp.com/"
"Where else do you promote your music?","**Reddit**
Find subreddits that will fit your style and post there, make up some clever title. Do not just post ""Band - Song title"", because nobody will check it out unless you're already famous.
Also if a song is about something, like a fantasy theme, you could probably get some listens at /r/fantasy or something like that.

**Youtube**
Make music videos, playthroughs, covers on youtube and if your content is good maybe the views will trickle over on your own stuff. Don't forget to tag stuff.
If you make a music video you can post it to http://www.blanktv.com/
If you're lucky a couple of thousands of people will see the video.

**Forums**
I hung out a lot at http://sevenstring.org/ and met some bloggers there who promoted my band for a while. Ultimate-guitar seems pretty nice too. If you have the time the best way to get notices is to form contacts with people who can spread the music.

**Facebook**
Facebook worked better before, but it's still one of the better places to share music. Make a page, make it look nice and message promotion pages and try to get them to post your music, there's a lot of them.
Or you can spend some money on advertising (not recommended) my page got 10000 likes for about 300 dollars but most of them are empty likes. Try to have continuous content to post on facebook or people will forget the page, it's hard, I try to post stuff as often as I can but I do it way to little.

**Bandcamp**
Great page, you can even get some cash if people like your stuff, pay what you want option is the way to go as an independent band. Make it look nice. [My bandcamp](http://empirine.bandcamp.com/) Same here, don't forget tags.

**Twitter**
Also good if you know how to use it (I don't).

Everything I write on facebook also posts on my twitter acount. My bandcamp page and Youtube page are linked to my facebook page [Empirine!](https://www.facebook.com/Empirine)

**Friends, contacts and blogs**
Probably the best way to spread music, share music to friends, get in touch with people who might like your stuff, write personal messages to smaller blogs.

"Where else do you promote your music?","So, uh, holy shit. Your tunes are rad as fuck. "
"Where else do you promote your music?","Thank you! It's a two man project I have with a friend. "
"Where else do you promote your music?","Youtube is usually a good bet, although it has gone downhill considerably since I started using it. You just have to talk to people on their channel and they are usually willing to watch your videos and subscribe if you ask or do the same for them. If you have a video camera (Like on your phone), and recording equipment, which it sounds like you do, you can make a decent video. Even some of my crappy videos got over 1k views, and you can always use them as a quick reference when telling someone about your music.  
Here's my youtube channel www.youtube.com/tfo13y "
"Where else do you promote your music?","Have you submitted to e-zines or magazines at all? Like Metal Injection, Heavy Blog is Heavy, NoiseCreep, etc? Getting reviews out is one method. Also check metal podcasts and radios and see if you can get your music added."
"Where else do you promote your music?","Seriously, I think promotion for independent bands is incredibly hard these days. We released our album recently, and contacted at least 60 press outlets, from print magazines to webzines to respected blogs. From that, we got fewer than 10 reviews, and some of those were only because we had prior connections with the site or writer.

YouTube is a joke for promo, and in fact it makes me angry just thinking about how Google profit off musicians while making it tougher for us. If you post your own videos on YouTube hardly anybody will see them, because there's nearly zero discoverability. However, there are a small handful of users who have a massive subscriber base, and if you're lucky enough to have them post up your video, it'll help a lot. But those users get shut down after a while because they are primarily breaching copyright. If these guys were careful to stick to unsigned bands and getting permission to upload, this could be a great route to reach people, but that doesn't seem to be how it's working out.

Last.fm *should* have been a great way to spread the word, allowing your band to bask in the reflected glory of similar bands and allow people to easily find more of the music they like. But no, CBS have let it go to shit, the original developers have all left, and the site is slowly atrophying away.

TL;DR - I don't know, and very little works these days!"
"Where else do you promote your music?","I feel you man. Youtube and Last.FM used to throw you great related material left and right. Now the scripts have all changed and the same bullshit gets promoted over and over."
"Where else do you promote your music?","I'm run a small label and I'm desperate to try and get some more exposure for it. 

I focus on Doom, Drone, Black Metal, Ambient, Noise. That type of thing.

"Looking for large and thorough guide(s) covering the majority of recording, mixing, mastering...","Hi again!

First of all, I apologize if this has been asked a million times before.

Recently I've been messing around with Reaper, trying to record stuff with my interface and programming drums with EzDrummer. However, I want to get a better understanding of the whole process of recording, mixing and mastering a song. Bits and pieces of information are easily found online, but I think a coherent tutorial type of thing would be more beneficial. Step by step, and easy to expand my knowlede later on.

So, does anyone know anything suitable for me? It could be an online guide or maybe even a book. Specifically Reaper-focused is fine, but I suppose an universal guide to all software would also work."
"Looking for large and thorough guide(s) covering the majority of recording, mixing, mastering...","Hey man,

I've read Roey Izhaki's ""Mixing Audio"" prolly 4-5 times over by now. It's very in-depth and has a lot of useful analogies to draw from. It ain't a ""here's how you mix metal""-guide, at all, but it will give you a solid foundation. Oh, it's a book, btw.

Apparently it's gone into it's 2nd edition, so things might have changed (most likely improved) since 1st ed.. 

Highly recommended."
"Looking for large and thorough guide(s) covering the majority of recording, mixing, mastering...","Thanks for your reply! It's sometimes difficult to find books around here without them being (badly) translated to finnish. But I'll definitely look into it, seems interesting!

Meanwhile, if anyone else still has suggestions keep them coming."
"Looking for large and thorough guide(s) covering the majority of recording, mixing, mastering...","Dude, Amazon and teh Interwebz.

Also: I'm in Denmark. If the Finnish library system is anything like ours you might very well find all the good stuff available there, for free. Bear in mind, for books it's probably best to own them since you may want to scribble notes all over the pages and they're useful for future reference."
"Looking for large and thorough guide(s) covering the majority of recording, mixing, mastering...","Præcis!

The library is a good call."
"Looking for large and thorough guide(s) covering the majority of recording, mixing, mastering...","This guy made a [Beginner's guide to mixing heavy metal at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqaJngdGpKc&amp;list=PL6C6A2072AD308954) on YouTube with 9 episodes. He's not a professional, and I haven't watched all the episodes, but it looks like he gets the basics covered pretty well. 

He uses Cubase, and the plugins that comes with that, but the basics are the same. He also uses EZDrummer, though, so it should be somewhat familiar to you. 

Poke around on [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Jamesmsv) for mini tutorials on other plugins as well."

"Question about strings","If your'e drop tuning that low you should re setup your ibanez because the intonation is probably gonna be way off, also the truss rod will probably need some adjusting. For drop C a setup isnt required, but is still optimal. Go with what string gauge feels the best, I use 11-49 with a floyd in standard and its too slinky on the bottom, try out different gauges and find the right one for the guitar and the tuning."
"Question about strings","How would I re-setup and adjust the truss rod?"
"Question about strings","If you're planning to keep the tuning for a longer time and don't have much experience with setting up guitars i would see a professional to do the work. If you do have experience you can look up intonating and truss rod adjusting on google, but the jist of it is intonation- how the guitar is tuned with itself, determines if the fretted note is exactly on key or slightly but noticably off. Truss rod is a rod that goes through most of the neck and controls the bending of the neck, most truss rods can go both ways- adjusting the truss rod helps with intonation and action and also makes sure that the neck isnt overly bent. "
"Question about strings","I'd probably do a 13-62 set for Drop A, and 12-60s for Drop C on the epi - it's got a shorter scale length so you'll need to compensate. Otherwise I'd suggest 11-56s. "
"Question about strings","Daddario's 11-56 pack is my favorite thing in the universe. I use them for drop B on 25.5"" scale and drop C on 24.75"" scale. Also I use a 64 for drop A on a 27"" scale and it feels great"

Anyway, apart from the vocals I think it's not all that bad. Especially the solo has this nice little melodic bit which I think works pretty well.

By all means judge me for it. Be harsh!"
"Some black thrash speed stuff a la Venom, Motorhead, Sodom etc.","Just scream satan 4x and thrash assault 2x and you are done with the lyrics. They'd fit to the music because they are nothing special and quite boring;) if i were you, i'd put some more work into it.keep it up."
"Some black thrash speed stuff a la Venom, Motorhead, Sodom etc.","Yep, I'm quite aware that it's very repetitive and boring. I think it's at least a good thing that the solo has a different part. For the rest, I think one single song like this is doable, especially if it's really short like this. I wouldn't want to write an entire album of this stuff though.

And of course, it works way better when played live. I'm mostly a big Sodom fan, and they have the shorter repetitive songs like Ausgebombt and Bombenhagel, but also longer and more complex stuff like Blood on your Lips and In War and Pieces. That's pretty much what I'm going for - some variation is key."
"Stereo recording/double tracking question","Hey everyone, I've been recording my guitar parts with a single sm57, BUT i have an AT2020 that i use sometimes as well - I usually double track my parts and pan them L/R
My question is this:
If i record using 2 mics (stereo - each mic is inherently ""panned"" left or right) does that negate the need to double track my guitars?
or if i double track while recording in stereo, does that have the same effect as quad tracking?


Thanks for all the great responses everyone - my plan for now, based on ur feedback, is this:
use 1 mic, and quad track, panning 2 tracks hard L/R and 2 closer to the center, like 60% L/R
Feeling that my guitars have too much low end in the mix, but i still want the guitars to sound clear and big

La Bella Strings (.09-.64)"
"Stereo recording/double tracking question","It depends on what your intentions are. Double and quad tracking guitars is usually to get the benefit of two things, one a wider image, two, a bigger/thicker sound. 

You can get one by using different microphone and panning techniques. Two requires double or quad tracking your guitars because that benefit is really the bi-product of the slight differences in each take of the same part. Double and quad tracking also makes for a bigger overall stereo image as well so it kind of does both at once.

I personally quad track all of my heavy rhythm guitars and double track the majority of my leads. I like it thick.  "
"Stereo recording/double tracking question","I discovered that one guitar part recorded twice makes one stereo guitar part in the center. I would still think you would have to record twice to double-track because the unique nuances of each clash to make a larger sound, whereas if you use two mics on one take and pan hard stereo you would end up with one in the center."
"Stereo recording/double tracking question","It will be a wider double track.  You will now be in the world of phase comb filtering.  There are alignment techniques but they never/rarely work better than refined mic placement.   You might want to have the 2020 further away from the cab like 3-4 feet back to give you room/bloom of the cabinet.  Then see if you like the performances grouped or the mics panned.  Think VH I close mic on one side and then the reverb/room sound on the other.  Different amp settings or guitars will give an even wider image.  Quad tracking is its own animal and it relies heavily on the tightness of performances."
"Stereo recording/double tracking question","Thanks for the reply!! 

So if im using 2 mics, assuming they are in phase &amp; panned and i want to double track, should i be created mono channels or stereo channels??

My thought was that a stereo channel hard panned left would not sound the one of the mics, and vise versa - am i wrong on that?"
"Stereo recording/double tracking question","I would keep each mic mono so you can mess with panning separately."
"Stereo recording/double tracking question","Stereo channel panning affects both channels so if you pan a stereo channel hard 100% to the left, it's equivalent to mixing both those down channels into a mono signal and sending them out the same speaker. The reason it's not actually a mono signal is because you still have 2 channels running, (one per mic), it just happens that you are sending them down the same side. 

With 2 mics you either record one stereo channel or two mono channels. Either way is mostly the same except that you will have two tracks in your DAW with mono. "
"Stereo recording/double tracking question","Thanks for hellpoing to clear this up for me, SO if i pan a stereo channel hard to the left, i wont be losing a mic, rather my DAW (cubase) will send BOTH mic signals to the left speaker? that helps a lot, thanks!!"
"Stereo recording/double tracking question","Correct. Stereo channels are always 2 signals, that's what stereo means. Panning merely affects how the DAW actually sends the signals to the speakers. Hard left means both are going 100% into the left speaker.

Cubase can also do a stereo channel where the individual signals within the channel can be panned (basically the same as having two mono channels, but controllable as a single channel), rather than having a single pan for the entire stereo channel. In this way, you can basically do stuff like (in your example) have the SM57 as hard left 100%, and the AT2020 as only 75% left. This means that the AT2020 will end up coming out of the right speaker a little bit. Or you can do stuff like SM57 40% left and AT2020 40% right, so that the stereo image is narrowly focused into the centre. The default mode for stereo is one signal is 100% left and one signal is 100% right, which is the widest stereo image you can achieve.

The only way you would ever lose a mic is if you muted it, basically.

Keep in mind, with two mics, you want to pay attention to phase relationships (wave interference caused by the physical difference in distance between the two mics.) In a nut shell, if one mic receives the sound from your amp after 3ms, and the other mic receives the sound from your amp after 5ms, there is a 2ms difference between the mics. This will cause destructive interference which is, in most cases, not a good thing. Try to line your mics up so they are the same distance from the amp. Don't be afraid to use a tape measure for this, I do it all the time.

Note, you can actually 'tune' your two mics, by setting them physically apart by very, very specific distances, to notch out specific frequencies but I think that may be a bit advanced for now. "
"Stereo recording/double tracking question","Thanks very much for that info! I'm practicing all the right stuff so i think i may just have to get better at achieving an even mix in general - making sure instruments own their frequency range, etc - and maybe turning up a little louder \\../ &gt;&lt; \\../"
"Stereo recording/double tracking question","You can literally hitpoint detect one guitar part, line it up to the other, and it will still sound different (and better IMO) than 2 mics on the same performance.  Not to detract what you get from 2 mics, but don't mix them in stereo expecting what you get from good double-tracked guitar."
"Stereo recording/double tracking question","For a more realistic sound, I'd prefer to record the tracks separately and also chance the EQ a bit between takes so things don't bleed too bad."

"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","I have no idea how to word this correctly or even explain it, so bare with me.

Everything I write is simplistic and bland. I feel like my ability far surpasses what I'm able to write, and it's frustrating to say the least. My knowledge of music theory is admittedly poor, but I'm working on fixing that through the free online sources I've found over at r/musictheory, but I know that that wont fix everything. 

I've been playing primarily metal guitar since I was 11, I'm 23 now and I feel, like the title says, stagnant and it's really getting me down. I've always loved metal and ever since I covered Hangar 18 with a friend when I was 17 and got all my solos down I was sold that Metal was what I wanted to play and write (of course my taste has strayed away from Megadeth since then). However, I've never been in metal bands. My primary instrument has always been guitar, but I always end up filling in on drums or bass for punk or similar bands. Don't get me wrong, I have fun with these bands, we play live frequently and the music is fun and enjoyable. But I'm not playing my favorite instrument, or my favorite music, and sometimes it feels like I've sold my soul. 
I don't really have any friends who like metal, well ok, none of my friends like metal, most of them despise it, so I never really get to jam some metal or even talk about it. So, perhaps that's another big reason for my shitty writing. But what are some exercises, or tips, y'all could give me for making my writing better. If I must, I can give you a shitty recording of my shitty riffs, just please, be gentle lol."
"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","Writing music has always been a combination of ear and theory to me. You gotta hear what you're writing before you even write it and you should at least know how some of it makes sense theoritically. Do you ever imagine sweet riffs in your head? The first step would be to try to transcribe that from your brain to the fretboard and then analyze wtf is going theoretically so that you can add to it based on your knowledge of music when/if your ear fails you."
"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","I can hear riffs in my head, but by the time I finally find the note it starts on I lose it completely, if I even find the first note. Should I just do more of those online ear training things? I'm sure it's just something I need to focus on more when I practice.

Part of me has the sneaking suspicion that I'll always be what a metal musician friend of mine (I do have a few, they just all live hundreds of miles away and we grew apart when I left for college) called ""a performance guitarist."" Which he described as someone who can't write but can play, it made me very frightened."
"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","It should take you no more than 2 seconds to find a note on the fretboard. Hear the note in your head, and slide your finger along a string until you hit the same note. It might be an octave high or low, but that doesn't matter. This is about your ear - if it takes you longer than 2 seconds to find a note on the fretboard then you need to practice doing exactly that, over and over, until you're good at it.

As for forgetting the riff, it helps if you repeat it back to yourself a bunch of times, maybe even hum or sing it, and then try to play along to that. Playing along to music you hear, without tabs or notation, is another skill you can teach yourself.

Now, being able to play along to stuff you hear *quickly*, without pausing on every note... that requires a decent understanding of intervals. If you hear 2 notes in succession, you should be able to know that if you find the first note on the fretboard, you know exactly, without trying different frets, where the next one will be. You should be able to recognise a minor third, a perfect 5th, etc.

There is also a feedback loop here too - if you know theory, then it makes all these other tasks easier. eg. If you know a song is in E natural minor, then the chances of any given note in the song being an F or a C# are very low. This means you find the right note quicker, you position your hands more effectively for the scale you're in, etc.

There are tools that can help you, but it sounds like you're aware of them. The important thing is that you keep working on all these aspects, but also that you link them together, not in isolation. If you're not translating what you learn of theory to concrete applications of playing metal on the guitar then it won't help you or stick with you as well."
"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","Hey, I can honestly say that learning some theory has brought life back into my playing. I started around the same age as you and very slowly, progressed and stagnated, up until 28 years old and a few months ago started taking lessons from a guitar teacher who actually enjoys metal.

I thought about online classes but the dynamic wasn't the same, I pay for a person's time and it just so happens they adapt to my learning curve and can respond to what I'm doing, the hands on approach is very different because the time spent is valuable for the both of you. It puts enough fire under your ass to say ""I'm paying for these lessons, and I don't want to waste this person's time."" Finding a good teacher who ""trims the fat"" but can still teach you according to your needs is the tricky part. Hope you get inspired again, if something starts to get boring up the ante!"
"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","It sounds too music nerd for a lot of people, but brushing up on theory and expanding your knowledge always gives you new ideas.  Listening to stuff that's not metal is handy as well."
"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","Here's a couple recommendations from my experience:

First off, if you have the opportunity to take a music theory or composition class, take it. Sure it's nerdy/not metal, whatever, and a lot of the time you'll feel the skills aren't things you need, but it really does help in ways you might not even notice. Honestly a lot of what you need to write are the sort of ""basic"" musical skills that get glossed over by a lot of the self taught guitar crowd, i.e. reading, ear-training and dictation (I include myself in this, I'm much worse at all of those skills than I would like to be, and I'm graduating with a degree in music in a couple months).

Another, easier suggestion is to try listening to new kinds of music. Especially if you're pretty good at guitar--and it sounds like you're probably better than I am--it can be a good experiment to expose yourself to some new uses of the instrument. For instance, if you're not usually into stoner metal, listen to some just to experiment, listen to the sounds they make with their instruments, and try to make similar sounds with yours. It doesn't matter if you know what it is they're doing, theoretically or technically, but recognizing a sound and figuring out how to make it is, I would argue, the most important step in learning to write music (especially in a riff-heavy genre like metal).

Third, and this part goes hand in hand with my other recommendations, as you're doing anything, listening, playing, writing, start paying attention to the units of sound that are used in the guitar part, and train yourself to recognize them in another context. It'll be easier if you have some basic musical knowledge (the names of intervals, for instance). If I were you, I would read up on some basic music theory and language, and then go back into songs you've already learned to play, and figure out how they work (for instance, ""okay, this shape on guitar makes a tritone, this is a major third, and here's where they get used in the key, and what kind of sound they make."" sorry if this part sounds basic, I don't know how much theory you have under your belt). The objective of this is that, soon, when you hear a sound in your head, instead of having to search the fretboard note by note, you'll immediately recognize ""oh, this is a tritone chord, and it's based on this note,"" or ""the next note I want is a major sixth above the last one."" Once you know what those things sound like, and know how to play them on the guitar, it becomes way easier to write riffs and songs. If you figure out your home key, everything else tends to just fall into place, and a great side-effect of having some extra theoretical knowledge is that if you find you're not sure what to do next, you can think about what *other* composers usually do next, and use that as a jumping off point (good artists borrow, great artists steal, etc).

Finally, just practice writing a lot. I've gotten to the point that I'll write complete, fully arranged songs that I have no intention of ever using, just to pass the time and experiment in other styles. If you don't have it already, I'd recommend buying Guitar Pro (or, you know, don't *buy* it, if that's your preference), since it's great, cheap software for fiddling around in, makes figuring out rhythmic notation and time signatures super easy, and honestly, even after using much higher-end software like Sibelius and Finale, I think Guitar Pro has one of the most intuitive interfaces of all music writing software.

Sorry that got pretty long winded, it's a recurring problem of mine. Hope some of that will be helpful. As a closing piece of advice, a lot of people talk about writing music as if it takes some kind of magical ""creativity"" gene, which personally I think is bullshit. Writing music is a skill that can be taught and trained, and while some people might be more predisposed toward it than others, there's no barrier for entry. You don't have to accept being a ""performance guitarist"" if you don't want to, and are willing to put in the work it takes to learn. Enjoy your metal journey!"
"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","Fantastic response! This gave me a lot to think about.

 I actually already use guitar pro. I've written a few songs on it but it always ends up simplistic. "
"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","I would just like to add that if you don't want to buy Guitar Pro, [TuxGuitar](http://tuxguitar.herac.com.ar/) is very similar it's free."
"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","True. The sound and UI for TuxGuitar aren't as polished as Guitar Pro, but it's an extremely competent (and open source!) editor."
"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","One thing I always tell people who are trying to write music but have little faith in the stuff they write is, record EVERYTHING you write. Learning how to use a DAW and buying an interface to record with is vital. For me, this has allowed the critique and in depth analysation of what I write, after which i choose the parts that sound good and work on that, often starting a new song with just that section. When i say new song, I don't mean 3.30 mins of music, i mean like 2/3 riff sections to just see how it flows. I've found that this also allows you to develop a personal song writing style. You need to not be afraid of writing shit music for a while. Much in the same way as practicing guitar, these things come with time. Challenge yourself, some days write slow songs, some days write fast songs. Some days write chord riffs with the toughest chords you know, some days write Iomi style single note riffs. Variation and recording every riff you write is key. If you have trouble remembering a riff, sing it into your phone, then transcribe it on to guitar, myself and all the songwriters I know do this, its extremely helpful."
"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","I'm in the same boat as you - never been in a functional metal band. One of the most recent notable contributions to improving my technique to be listening to a ton of Steve Vai, particularly the album ""The Story of Light"" along with equal amounts of Trivium (mainly ""Vengeance Falls"" and ""In Waves""). There's a lot to be learned from the way Vai does bends, long sustains, and adds a more ""vocal"" aspect to is guitar with volume/gain adjustments throughout his songs. Another recommendation (you may not struggle with this, but it's worth mentioning) would be to learn to play something slow and clean before you jump into 180bpm. I had to essentially re-learn to play guitar when it finally dawned on me how important it is that each note is distinct and uniform when doing fast riffs. 

For example, look at my last reddit submission (top of my profile), which was a rough draft guitar solo instrumental. Took me  about 45min to and hour to lay down the two guitar tracks for the solos from 1:19 to around 1:50 in that song because I decided to force myself to play clearly before playing quickly. This is especially important when you have multiple guitar tracks harmonizing.

Edit: Accidentally a punctuation."
"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","Make sure you are learning song by ear. I'm similar to you in that I'm opposite: I feel like in an adequate player, for the most part, but I can write riffs and licks from dusk to dawn. More often than not, I write stuff I can't even play. 

I hit a plateau after about my first year and a half of learning how to play guitar (I started at 19),  and I didn't know what to do. I started listening to new music, that helped a bit. Then, I wanted to learn how to play new songs and styles to diversify my mental musical repitiore (sorry, I can't fucking spell that word and my autocorrect is being a fucking idiot). I also made sure to try as hard as I could to learn songs by ear. And this is the reason, I think, that I can write songs much better than I used to. If you take the time and really practice learning a song by ear, it's like you'll be gaining a sense of clarity that you were lacking. You fill the gap between what is arbitrary and abstract and what you can construct and make tangible. At first, you're not really gonna see it. When I first started writing, none of the songs I wrote actually sounded the way they did in my head. They were just as close as I could get. Now, I hear a melody in my head, play it how I hear it. I'll record it and play it back, then I hear the harmonies, and I can punch that out. And it's very satisfying to be able to do this. I'm assuming this is where you're trying to get to.

It's okay to cheat and look at tabs when you're just fucking stumped. But overall, if you stick with it, you can learn songs by ear with no issues. If you want an easy band to try this with, I recommend Gojira. The grandeur of this band comes from performance and tone more so than the actual quality of the writing. The writing is good, just in no way complex musically speaking. Most of their songs are in D standard. I think From Mars to Sirius is the album that perfectly balances fun songs to play with writing and technique that's not to hard at all. "
"How can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)","I honestly think this is what I'm lacking in my playing. I can't play much by ear and I think this is another thing I'm going to actively start working on. Thanks!"

"i don't like my misha mansoor OD. what's a good TS- OD i can put my money towards?","My personal favorite is the Maxon ST9+ Supertube. Its very similar to the Maxon OD808 (Which is great too) but has 18V operation, True Bypass, Low Boost, and a Mid Enhancement knob. Rob Barret from Cannibal Corpse boosts his Rectifiers with the ST9 and its also the one I use. It is quite pricey at 200 dollars though. If you don't want to drop quite that much money, the classic Ibanez tubescreamers or the Maxon OD808 are fantastic too."
"i don't like my misha mansoor OD. what's a good TS- OD i can put my money towards?","I use pretty much any old tube screamer / over drive for the desired tone.

I have a Joyo Classic Overdrive that works just fine at home. A MXR Classic Overdrive that I use on my live rig. In the studio locker I've got TS-9, TS-808, Maxon 808, ect.

They all kinda do the same thing. I chose the MXR for the live rig over the TS's and the Maxon due to the amp that I'm using (Mark IV). It just suited my tone better. If I was going to switch back to running my old 5150's the Maxon or the TS-808 would be back for sure cause those sound the best to my ears. If I was going to break out the old JCM800 and take that out, the TS-9 all day. 

It's personal preference but you don't have to spend $200 on an overdrive that your basically just going to be using as a clean boost. "

Its supposed to be the same as a Landgraff Dynamic Overdrive. I have been pretty happy with this so far. If you are OK with a soldering iron, i would recommend this.

Before i decided to just build what i wanted, i was also looking at the Voodoo Lab Sparkle Drive Mod. I think that's worth a look too."

"How do you make things sound louder without clipping?","So take for example [my cover of crystal mountain](https://soundcloud.com/jackson-k-3/c-mountain-c) and death's [actual song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zguCFjHyVeM).

What am I doing wrong? If I go higher than normal, things start to clip. If I lower everything, then its kind of muddy and not as precise. I'm messing with EQ's to an extent, but I'm not sure if changing the sound of my guitar entirely is the point of EQing... And I right now the only thing I have going is a VST program that prevents clipping (T-Racks.) Even if I turn that off, something is still missing with my production.

Anyone have sound loud and clean tips?"
"How do you make things sound louder without clipping?","The trick is to use a mastering limiter on the master track, lowering the threshold would make everything sound louder. If you go too crazy with it though, you get Death Magnetic."
"How do you make things sound louder without clipping?","A great way to use EQ is to split out the frequencies of double tracked guitars so they don't cut into each other. Boost the bass on one and the treble on the other. A multiband compressor will also let you selectively control different frequency ranges instead of just flattening the whole track."
"How do you make things sound louder without clipping?","Before you apply a limiter to your master track, you'll probably want to make sure that you don't have a lot of extra frequencies taking space in the mix."
"How do you make things sound louder without clipping?","how would I know that?"
"How do you make things sound louder without clipping?","Usually what I do is take a band pass filter and move it up and down the frequencies of a track to pinpoint some undesirable frequencies and cut them a bit. Especially very high and very low ones(&lt;40Hz). They're not usually contributing much to your sound and just taking up space. 

Personally, I bring everything in the mix to about -6db in the master track, apply any mastering effects and throw a limiter at the end of an effect rack to bring the volume up.
Like the first comment said though, don't try to push too much through your limiter or it'll be forced to compress everything and it'll sound terrible..."

"Can anyone help? Need a short list of semi simple songs to present to other musicians","I play guitar and I play fairly well I'm confident in what I play. But I'm going to have a jam session with another guitarist who's fairly new but can learn and a bassist who plays mostly funk and soul. 

I Just got the idea for all three of us to give the others a list of songs we should all learn so we have something to play when first meet up. They're very open and I just want to feel out what they're capable of. Can't think of fun metal songs for them to learn quickly. Any ideas?

 Any genre is acceptable really. a few  bands we all know are along the lines of three days Grace, killswitch engage, and sort of heavy rock bands like that. I'm wanting to bring more metal to it and possibly throw in a meshuggah song or something progressive, but simple. "
"Can anyone help? Need a short list of semi simple songs to present to other musicians","Metallica. Always Metallica. Pretty much everyone likes them and knows at least some songs by them, and a lot of them are pretty easy. On personal recommendation I'd suggest For Whom The Bell Tolls first. The guitar part is pretty easy and the bass part has that cool solo (also very easy) to keep him entertained."

"Any advice on recording and mixing/mastering death metal vocals?",""
"Any advice on recording and mixing/mastering death metal vocals?","Get a decent mic if you can, and try different ones if possible. (Shure SM7B is often used.) A pop shield will help as there is likely to be a lot of air moving. Record in a proper vocal booth if you can, but if not, make sure you find a room with as little reverb as possible. Cover solid surfaces with soft fabrics, close any curtains, and secure any loose or rattling objects. You want to be able to clap loudly and not hear any weird ringing or rattling. Buy or borrow a [Reflexion shield](http://www.seelectronics.com/rf-pro) or equivalent.

Get the vocalist to do their loudest roar to begin with so you can set your levels adequately to avoid clipping. Record as normal. Listen closely during tracking to make sure the takes have as much (or as little) enunciation as you need. Track each part a few times so that you can double-track if you like. Make sure the vocalist is consistent with their delivery timing. If a whole verse or chorus requires the vocalist to gasp between lines, consider having them deliver alternate lines during recording (eg. lines 1 and 3 first, then 2 and 4 on the next take).

High-pass the track to make it sit in the mix better. If your mic or interface has a high pass filter available during recording, engage that. Use a noise gate to cut noisy silences between phrases, but be careful not to have it pump on breathing or the start of a word. If you're not confident about getting that right, just cut the vocal manually in your DAW later. Consider using a de-esser, but listen carefully to make sure it doesn't give the vocalist a lisp. You might prefer to do manual de-essing with gain automation or spot EQ.

Compress it heavily to make it of a more consistent volume afterwards. (Automate the gain first if some sections are significantly quieter than others.) 2 compressors in serial can work well, as can 2 in parallel if you have one for the fundamental frequencies and one for the high frequencies. Consider a high shelf EQ if you need a bit more clarity and get the vox coming through the mix.

Consider sending the vocal to a reverb bus, but be careful not to overdo it. Delay can work too, if synced to the tempo, and if you put the effort in to duck it during the phrases and only really 'breathe' between them.

Example of a death metal vocal I recorded myself for our band following the above advice: http://twilightsembrace.bandcamp.com/track/ego-trip"
"Any advice on recording and mixing/mastering death metal vocals?","This pretty much hits about everything you need to know on the head. The SM7B is about the best mic for this application in my opinion. 

The only other thing that I do sometimes based on the situation is create a copy of the track, pitch it up and down slightly and then compress the shit out of it. Slight verb (something to delay it slighly behind) and then bring it up very slowly in the mix until you can barely hear it. Adds some great depth. Also with this trick I like to dump whatever EQ the singer has naturally a lot of and boost the ones that need help (like -db's at 500 and 1.5k and a boost at 750 ect)."

Secondly, metalcore, really? No. This is a subreddit for Metal, not this mindless chugging.

I actually wouldn't go overboard on increasing the bass. There were some really great low frequencies coming through.
I think any suggestions are really down to personal preference. I mean, the music is pretty generic but with the quality and obvious ear you seem to have in what you're doing, I'm pretty certain you'll have no problem putting your own unique spin on certain things with time and experience. 
I wasn't totally loving the drum sound but again, that's my taste and it wasn't bad per se. I think a less processed sound may have served the overall quality even more. A bit of guitar craziness here and there would also have made it more up my street.

The only opinion that could be considered ""negative"" that I have is that something about the recorded guitar tone isn't setting well with me, as if you need to turn the mids or highs up just bit more. Perhaps in the mastering of the audio. Hopefully that makes sense. The riffs simple in some parts, but groovy overall. They just need to *pop* out a bit more.

I'm not into audio engineering so I'm not sure how that would work.

Just my two cents. Keep up the good stuff. From now on, I'll be watching..."

This is the kind of feedback I am looking (not the good words although they are always welcome but the constructive criticism on what people consider negative). 

The whole recording is DIY, we did everything ourselves with not very good equipment and not much knowledge on production. I am not mentioning this as an excuse but simply as a fact. "
"A new song we recorded with my band ALBERT. Looking for opinions (we play classic thrash)","Your band name is fuckin' metal. I love it! Great job guys! :)"
"A new song we recorded with my band ALBERT. Looking for opinions (we play classic thrash)","Song's pretty spot on musically, though as you said you're not really experts on production so it does sound like it was recorded in a couple of basements.  Don't take that as a knock, that comes with time, but the music is badass, keep it up!  Where are you guys from?"
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","Hey guys, I want to make a reproduction of the Furman PQ-3, the box that shaped Dimebags Tone. The one so many folks have sought. Not a one trick pony, this box was originally made for the Grateful Dead. I use it myself. I am going to have a small batch made if I can gather enough interested people.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=furman%20pq3&amp;sm=3

So would anyone here be interested in this?
"
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","Price? 

This isn't the 'only' piece that was dimebags tone. It also had a lot to do with using a higher wattage solid state amp, the blue box MXR 6 band EQ and Bill Lawrence XL-500's. "
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","Indeed.

I think the RG100 preamp is much more important to getting his tone - if you don't have that I can't see the EQ helping much.

In saying that, could be interested - price depending."
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","I own a first run Krankenstein - it can be done with tubes too. It's all in the eq's. "
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","Would you mind sharing your EQ settings, because I can't get my second run Krankenstein to sound a fucking thing like the RG...serious question, not taking the piss."
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","The first run is a bit different. 

The way I get there is with two EQ's and the use of the loop. One EQ (6 band) up front boosting the mids and then one eq in the loop actually scooping them (a 10 band). then i play with the sweep on the front and make sure the pot is pulled on the efx loop boost. 

So many people wrote off the Krankenstein because they didn't understand how to use an EFX loop. I get pretty much spot on with that. "
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","Cheers, I see you're pretty much running the same way Dime did.

I've only got a 6-band at the moment, so may try getting the second EQ and see what that does.  Also mine is the 20w Jr into the Krank single 12"" (or a Blackstar 4x8"")  which I don't think is helping.  I'm thinking a 212 or 412 with V30s may help also.

I don't really want Dime's tone as my tone, but I like playing Pantera songs and it would be nice to be able to achieve a similar tone for that stuff."
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","I've got the full head and running it into a 4x12 with Eminence Texas Heats."
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","Completely delete your mids. Voila!"
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","Tone?
You just need to kill all tone with distortion.."
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","He had a 'sound' - whether people liked it or not, it was instantly recognizable and that's hard to say for a lot of guys out there that just use 5150's..."
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","He's my favorite guitarist :). The gain he uses is like nothing I've ever heard. It's spot on, low attack low release."
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","There's a video on youtube somewhere that has Zakk Wylde getting on stage with Dime and playing on dime's rig and it sounds like Zakk. Lots of the tone is in your hands."
"Dimebag Darrell Tone- EQ","I'd love to see that vid"

"My cover of Mouth Of Kala by Gojira. All instruments and Vocals done by me. The drums where done using a Midi track.",""
"My cover of Mouth Of Kala by Gojira. All instruments and Vocals done by me. The drums where done using a Midi track.","You're a bit off at times, like with a few of the drops and stops and stuff (iconic Gojira technique). And your tone is a bit too thin for Gojira, not enough ""boom"" coming from those punches. And the end sounded a bit silly because of how staccato you were hitting those points. I think you were muting the whole note altogether when in the actually song you palm mute the note but let that palm mute ring. I could record an example if you'd like.

Aside from that, I was impressed! Especially with the vocals. Not many people can pull a Joe Duplantier but you definitely can pull it off if you stick to it. 

Bonus points if you learned this song by ear. That's how I did it. It's actually a very easy song to learn by ear. I meant to cover it a long time ago but you beat me to it! So I'm gonna maybe do Liquid Fire... Maybe Space Time. Or Explosia. 

Overall, 7/10. Great effort and I could tell you really thought out what you were doing. "
"My cover of Mouth Of Kala by Gojira. All instruments and Vocals done by me. The drums where done using a Midi track.","Thanks for the feedback. The tone I usually record with is much more punchier, but I tried to emulate the Gojira tone (and failed). If you could record an example that would be very helpful. I will probably re record it at some point and tighten it up etc.
Also I learned the song from guitar pro mostly, I didn't play along to the actual song. I should probably do that."
"My cover of Mouth Of Kala by Gojira. All instruments and Vocals done by me. The drums where done using a Midi track.","Playing along to the track itself will definitely help! Lol. That way you'll really feel the timings and rhythms with the feel they created. Guitar pro can only do so much lol. I think it's a great tool for transposing but I don't take it too far beyond that. 

Yeah man I'll fiddle around with my guitar and record some examples. I'm not going to do the whole song, but a few select parts. Just gonna throw it together. Definitely keep rocking out though, dude. "
"My cover of Mouth Of Kala by Gojira. All instruments and Vocals done by me. The drums where done using a Midi track.","Here you go. I couldn't get addictive drums to work, so I didn't bother with the drum part. I'm bad at programming midis anyways. 

Here's the intro:

One of the transition parts, which is really hard to get to sound right without drums, but I did my best:

I didn't quite get my tone perfect either, since it turns out that my guitar strings are super shitty. But, I think I got close, a bit. "

"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","I figured metal musicians would get the most doubt in our career choice...it takes A LOT of time and practice. It takes serious love and appreciation. It's a fucking hard genre to write and perform. But it makes me wonder...how many of my favorite musicians pushed through the doubt to get where they are today? Theres the young and talented metal musician Scott Carstairs of Fallujah or Alex Rudinger who just turned 24 a couple days ago...how much doubt did they endure? Because both of them are fucking amazing...and older than me by just a couple years!

I don't know, I'm receiving a lot of doubt right now from my family because they think becoming a touring metal musician is a pipe dream. It's not like I wanna be a world famous rock star...fuck that. 

So...who plays metal and who keeps playing through all the haters? I do. Makes me work harder. 

Here's my band!:

soundcloud.com/arborealofficial"
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","First of all...becoming a touring metal musician is not a pipe dream. Thinking you can make any sort of living off of it *is*, however. Very few people can actually make a living off of it. If you do, you're very lucky.

That doesn't mean you shouldn't strive towards that goal. You just shouldn't bank on it by any means. Keep up a good work ethic in your life, and it will amp up your work ethic in music, too. 

Personally, I'd say I'm my biggest doubter. I find myself completely dis-enthused and even jaded at times. The main way I can get through this is by trying to play with as many different musicians as possible. I'm lucky to have a large amount of friends and acquaintances who are phenomenal musicians. Playing with better musicians makes you better, and makes you want it more and more, and inspires you. 

I only get to tour about two weeks out of every year, if that much. I'd like to do more, but one must be reasonable and realistic. I'm only 25, so I am still young. If you get to this age and think you're slacking because you're not touring 2 or 3 months out of the year yet, don't give up. Seen plenty of my friends who ate shit for years before finally hitting it ""big"" and touring a bunch in their late 20s, early 30s. As long as you keep with it, and keep focused, it's a reasonable reality"
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","Thanks for your advice! I'm actually used to being the better musician in the room but you're right...I have to change that soon"
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","It's a big help. Playing with a superb drummer I would say is what you should strive towards the most. There's not much more satisfying things in playing music than when the drummer gets it immediately. I've played with a dude a couple times who has understood my riffs better than I ever did. But he is an exception to the rule haha"
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","Yes my fiance is the superb drummer in this situation, and fuck it helps a lot. The drums on the demos are a machine but he wrote all of them.

Here's my youtube channel, we covered Protest The Hero together:

"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","
I am my biggest threat to my success.  ADHD, anxiety, self-doubt, poor confidence, being bad at multi-tasking, getting bored, etc...It's all me.  If anyone (except my wife) told me I was crazy, I wouldn't give two shits.  






I play in a hardcore/crossover band and we get out, on average, twice to four times every 6 weeks.  We've played a couple festivals and with some serious bands and have gotten around.  We all have full-time jobs, I have a family, and our responsibilities keeps us physically grounded.  






This is the most active and the most profitable I have ever been in a band and it's not what I envisioned when I was 15.  However, I play with guys I know and respect, a couple I've known for over ten years.  If not for our representation, we wouldn't be getting paid anything - we're lucky that our expenses are getting paid back.  So, while I am not road-dogging it for 22 weeks out of the year, or playing at Hellfest, I'm really grateful for the opportunities I have.  "
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","Where is your band from? "
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","Texas (yee haw)"
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","I feel like Texas is a tough crowd for hardcore/metal....But I think we play completely different kinds of music haha. How is the fanbase for you out there? "
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","Good.  The band has been around for while, so there's a good base of dedicated fans and friends.  This year, South and Central Texas had great energy."
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","There's nothing wrong with working towards that goal, just make sure you've got a career to fall back on if it doesn't work out. Get a good job and keep practicing/playing in your spare time, if you do get lucky enough to make it a full-time job then there'll come a time when you'll be able to quit your day job and be a professional musician."
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","I get doubt from inside my own band... I'll send them a piece and all I get is, ""that's cool but I can't play that"" in return. What I try to convey to them is that a new piece should always be daunting, but it's never impossible unless you give up before you even try. 

But I doubt if we'll ever tour or make money... we're in this because we love it, I guess. Everything else is just gravy for us. "
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","That is too bad...maybe you should suggest longer hours of alone time practice to the members of your band so you can play the harder stuff. Can I have a listen to your music?"
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","I'm definitely already trying to drill that into them.

All I have are crappy GP renders at the moment. Most of our old stuff is between hard rock and alternative metal. We previously recorded an album, but the producer didn't understand what kind of band he was mixing; it turned out badly and I refuse to show it to anyone. Frankly, I don't know what kind of band we are, we just play what we like. 

This is the latest song I've been pushing. It's still missing some parts (like an intro, for starters). I also don't really know how to write drums.

https://soundcloud.com/visceracodex/untitled-metal"
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","That song would be so sick with real stuff! Keep going man, and maybe excel above your band mates to get them moving. "
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","I've been playing guitar for 20 years, and there's still a lot of stuff I can't play that some kids have mastered in a few months.

Not everybody has the kind of mentality for drilling practices or learning to shred. You probably don't want to change the music you write (and why should you?) so you might have to dish out some polite ultimatums to your band and be prepared to replace them."
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","I have given up on touring in a band right now, fuck I have only played 2 shows in a metal band. So I never even came close to having fans. I have resorted to being a bedroom artist and if that's all I ever become as long as I can release some metal for the world I will be happy.

I never wanted to be a rockstar, just some dude in a band. I can't even be that right now so maybe when I'm older.

Don't give up, just fail a lot and maybe you'll make it."
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","I get doubt from all sides, even the other metal musicians I know. But its what I like to do and god dammit Im gonna do it. Right now all I do is record, I put the dream of touring and all that behind me since Im 22 now and dont have much to show for anything.

My parents always supported me in their own way. They hate my music but they can appreciate that Im ""good"" at what I do.

It all comes down to if you have the means to be a touring musician, do it. If you dont have the means (such as my self) compromise and have a backup plan for if it doesnt work out.

Your band has an awesome sound though, keep it up and youll be living your dream in no time!"
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","Thanks for your kind words! That's all I want to do is tour and be on the road. My fiancé actually is the drummer in our band, it helps the dream for sure. (I'm a female) "
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","Currently starting up my own project. All of my band mates are just as pumped about getting out and playing music, so it really helps to bounce hype off each other. Find some people that are just as passionate as yourself. You'll never doubt yourself again. "
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","I know the feel...I need more people who are stoked. Where is your project from? "
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","We're out of davenport IA. Look is up if you get a chance!

"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","I've released a couple of metal albums and got decent press for them, so that part is 'done'. But touring? That'll probably never happen. It's so hard to get shows these days (at least here in the UK) because nobody wants to see unsigned bands they've never heard of, so being able to get more than one show a month is unusual; getting enough to 'tour' is impossible. I think that unless you're playing one of the trendy subgenres, you'll be on album 3 or 4 before there is enough interest for international tours and the like."
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","Does your band still strive to become signed one day? "
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","Not really. It's not like 10 or 20 years ago where the label would not only pay for your recording but also pay for you to go on tour to promote it. So you don't get much benefit. Maybe they can introduce you to booking agents and publicists, but it's still not guaranteed they'll take you on, and you can get those without a label if you're lucky. I know quite a few signed musicians and they still work full-time day jobs so it's not like it changes their life or means they've ""made it"". It just means someone has agreed to cover the cost of making an album every couple of years, in exchange for taking most of the money from it."
"Metal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?","Hm, my band is my hobby. It's (one of many) very expensive and time-sinky hobbies and is clear to everyone involved and who knows me, that it ist just that a hobby.
I do not want to earn money with music, I am quite happy when a label helps out or we get some cash out of gigs to do merch etc. but I like my primary caree choice way to much, to even think of abandoning it for anything else."
"A One Man Metal Band","Hello,

I recently started taking my recording and performing very seriously and have made big strides in my skills, and I want to get some input from you guys on an idea I had.

First I want to say:

I've been writing, recording, mixing, mastering and producing my own metal for a couple months now and I'm getting close to having some material I finally feel comfortable enough to share.

I'm confident that eventually I will be bringing some of my metal to the stage and I want to do it with just me singing, my guitar and a laptop with everything else.

Now onto the actual conflict.

I'm aware people go to concerts to SEE the band play, so I know I need to figure out some way to keep people VISUALLY entertained while I'm the only person up there playing.

And...
Actually, that's it. Any ideas welcome!!! 

"
"A One Man Metal Band","I do the same thing. I've thought about the whole live show thing, I think it would be rather difficult to do well. 

That said, if I wanted to keep it interesting, I would try and change instruments and show off the playability of a little bit of all of it. "
"A One Man Metal Band","This is also another option I thought of. I can sing and play guitar simultaneously and sing and drum(still learning though) simultaneously as well. 

Perhaps that incorporated into something theatrical? Maybe a story I depict with audible(the music) and visual aspects. "
"A One Man Metal Band","&gt; Perhaps that incorporated into something theatrical? Maybe a story I depict with audible(the music) and visual aspects.

Honestly, I don't think you need to do anything special if you're good musically.  I think you run the risk of it coming off as cheesy if it's too overdone so simplicity would be the key.

Solo playing lends itself a bit better towards shreddy, Satriani/Vai/Malmsteem type stuff in my opinion but I don't think that it needs to be all 'diddly-diddly' your whole set, especially if you're singing.

&gt;I'm aware people go to concerts to SEE the band play...

I don't think this is the case all the time.  I'm not only there to hear/see bands, I'm there to drink some beers, meet people, fail at getting laid, and at the risk of being cliche, the atmosphere.  I mean, I've seen plenty of local bands that were awesome but were really just four dudes standing in the same spot headbanging away.  They didn't really offer anything visually besides a mass of hair and denim but fuck it, music was good.  The other thing to remember is you're going to start by playing small local shows, people paying $5-10 to get in aren't expecting pyrotechnics or Metallica S&amp;M.  And chances are, you'll find people at those shows who will want to jam, if that's the route you want to take.

I think if you go up there, not as a guitarist and singer but as a performer it can work.  Be animated, have a good time, do your thing well and fucking own that shit."
"A One Man Metal Band","It's a bit of a myth, really.  Some bands, you go for the visuals.  Things like GWAR, KISS, or any band that you know are going to have pyro or lasers or something.

But there are plenty of successful bands who don't do anything but play.  Chevelle, Staind, Tool all come to mind immediately.  Even the White Stripes.  Actually, every 2-piece I can think of.

People go to shows for the experience.  So make your show an experience.  Even if that just means experiencing the music.

Also, you could get a projector and have something playing on the wall behind you. :)"
"A One Man Metal Band","Yeah! I was thinking about projecting something but not sure what it would be. 

Perhaps screens of me playing the rest of the instruments? It sounds cool in theory but I'm not sure how entertaining that would be hahah "
"A One Man Metal Band","I think that would actually be a little cheesy, but maybe if you do it well.

Or you could go full cheese and talk to your other selves in between songs lol"
"A One Man Metal Band","Hahahah oh gosh. 

Dim the lights completely so no one can see my face while I talk to myself in different voices...I think I'd scare people away lol"
"A One Man Metal Band","That could definitely work, or it could completely bomb. But then that goes for most everything, you should definitely consider it! I've never seen such a thing in a musical act, and being unique is definitely one way to get traction."
"A One Man Metal Band","This is true. I really won't know until I try!"
"A One Man Metal Band","I'm in the same boat as you. I collab with some people here in this sub to get my music made, but if I were to go on stage, it'd just be me. And I've never played on stage with a band, let alone by myself. "
"A One Man Metal Band","Yeah that sounds about right! I'm still working on getting my music up here though. I really didn't expect this much help from this post! "
"A One Man Metal Band","My personal opinion is that live metal should be a full band for 'real' shows, even if the project is a one-man deal. But don't let me bring you down as it's just my perspective on live performance. 


Some ideas: 


- Incorporate some visuals if you're capable and if that's your thing. I don't know if you're familiar with Pretty Lights (some kind of electronic genre), but the guy used to just be onstage by himself with a laptop. He used a lot of lighting and some visualizations on a screen to keep it more interesting (as do most electronic musicians it seems). 


- Be charismatic. The hardest part about being alone will be the fact that *you're alone*. This means that the audience's attention will be on you 100% of the time rather than being distributed amongst your bandmates. [Devin Townsend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nubJjB95VdY) is a good example of being able to carry an audience by himself (though he still uses a full band normally). 


- Engage the audience. This is part of having charisma, but be sure to pay attention to the audience and not get lost focusing on yourself. Maybe have them clap a long or ""Hey!"" along if you can get them too. Anything that makes it feel like they didn't just stumble into your bedroom rehearsal where you haven't noticed them. 



- If you can, maybe go for a more non-traditional stage setup. Rather than having you on the stage on one side of the room and a wall of people on the other, try putting your setup so you and your stool or whatever are in the middle of everyone with a circle of people around. Stuff like this will diminish the gap between you and the audience both physically and psychologically. 


Anyway, that's about all I can think of. And most of it is a lot easier said than done.

"A One Man Metal Band","&gt;Devin Townsend

Is that... christmas bells in the background? Haha, that was... fun, but way too cheesy. And he seems like a complete douchebag. Not sure why anyone would want to watch that live."
"A One Man Metal Band","You mean the synth? 


And Devin is the exact opposite of a douchebag. Really considerate, hilarious guy that doesn't get caught up in all the bullshit of metal and the entertainment industry. Though he embraces cheesiness on a lot of stuff, he's incredibly diverse from [heavy stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeG-6bpeUkA) (and much heavier), to [rock stuff](http://youtu.be/rvnOvUy78cI?t=1m22s) to [softer stuff](http://youtu.be/3iuwY4s7AuY?t=6s) to [really mellow](http://youtu.be/qHVnebR7s5A?t=54s) stuff. "
"A One Man Metal Band","I saw him live opening for BTBAM once and it was literally the craziest live show I've ever seen. This guy is a monster, I didn't even know he existed until then and I definitely wanted more after. Incredibly unique on stage, very humble off stage."
"A One Man Metal Band","Some people pull it off- people show up to see Brendon Small perform his shit live and he just turns on his computer, plays along to his own songs, and keeps it interesting by cracking jokes in between playing stuff. Sometimes he hires people to perform the other guitar parts/drums live just for the show, but you don't have to do that- just wanted to put that out there. "
"A One Man Metal Band","Brendon Small is probably my biggest influence for this goal of mine. 
He's got something that sets himself aside, and so that's what I want to figure out for myself."
"A One Man Metal Band","I feel you. I fucking love the man- he's my guitar and metal idol. I'm getting one of his signature guitars this summer and I'm going to put it in C Standard so that I can play all of his shit. "
"A One Man Metal Band","....is it the snow falcon? "
"A One Man Metal Band","Nope, Epi Thunderhorse. I'd get the Gibson one, but I can't afford that shit and the Epi is nearly identical in every way. 

I'd love a Snow Falcon, but I love the Explorer shape over all other guitar shapes and want a nice one first. "
"A One Man Metal Band","I agree completely. There's just something about the explorer that is just so marvelous. So I had to get one too!"

And recently I played on one of the Thunderhorse guitars and I was BLOWN AWAY at how much I loved playing it. I like it probably just as much as the gibson."
"A One Man Metal Band","I'm glad to hear that. The Epiphone on paper sounds amazing but I've only been able to play the Gibson and I'm taking as chance on it. "
"A One Man Metal Band","You definitely will NOT be disappointed."
"A One Man Metal Band","I was in one band where the lead guitarist wrote all the parts. Everyone else (including myself) just pretty much performed what they wrote. So you could do something like this, just find some people to play with you. 

Another idea is just go up on stage and perform by yourself. I've also done this. I performed the vocals only and people were rather into it, especially when I came off the stage and joined the pit."
"A One Man Metal Band","That's awesome! Was there anything else you did that you think contributed to getting the crowd going? Aside from the quality of the music lol"
"A One Man Metal Band","Well you don't necessarily have to do much

Hes the only one man band I've seen live that has been impressive. I think the most important thing is to SOUND like a full band. You want your recorded stuff to sound good, you dont want to sound like a guitar+vocals over some random bullshit. Make sure the prerecorded drums and everything sound real and thick."
"A One Man Metal Band","In all honesty, don't do that unless your material is truly mindblowing and original. At the very least, get a talented live drummer. A good drummer is so integral to a live performance, especially in metal. If it's just you and a laptop up there, you're probably going to get laughed off the stage (or more likely, zero crowd reaction). You have to think of a live show as a *performance*.

I don't want to discourage you from trying new things though and I haven't heard your music to be a fair enough judge. But you gotta put yourself into the shoes of a metalhead audience and what the expectations are for people who pay money to see live shows. Even the slowest, doomiest performances can be high-energy in their own way. A dude standing up there with a guitar and a laptop doesn't exactly get me excited, nor does it sound worth the money/drive to see. 

Brendon Small gets away with it because he's a one-of-a-kind artist and he's already made himself semi-famous for his work in a lot of other popular, widely-known projects. He has a pretty big fanbase to allow him to perform solo. Startup artists such as yourself are starting from nothing and first impressions are pretty damn important. Don't blow it; be patient and wait until the timing, gear, personnel, and performance is ready. It will pay off in the long run if you take it slow and do it right."
"A One Man Metal Band","Check out [Author &amp; Punisher](http://vimeo.com/7197473), that dude makes it really interesting. "

"A One Man Metal Band","NIN and Cloudkicker are both solo acts.  The first Foofighters album was a solo effort.

"A One Man Metal Band","To add to that, my band (old school heavy metal) was put in a position where we had to play live with a drum machine a few times, throws the crowd of quite a bit.  I would bet if the music had more obvious electronic influences the audience would be more accepting."

Was there anything about these solo performers that you liked in particular?"
"A One Man Metal Band","For those performers the two things that really stood out were:

Good musicians.  I wanted to listen to their music, so lack of the band didn't phase me.

Animated and moving around on the stage.  On a small stage with a band there's not much room to move around, the solo guys had the stage space and used it.

"Diddly evolved; posted a lesser version 2 months ago, now I've added a lot more.","I really like the riffs. The transitions are great and the song composition seems well thought out.

The guitars sound a little cold to me at the beginning for some reason as the song progresses I don't notice it as much. Maybe the additional layering is adding warmth. I'm not sure. Regardless if you're happy with your tone, who am I to criticize. 

One more thing at 0:25 when you transition to the main riff I think it should be much larger. The volume seems to decrease instead of explode after that buildup. 

Good job on the song man, followed - I wanna see where you go with this!

"
"Diddly evolved; posted a lesser version 2 months ago, now I've added a lot more.","Thanks man!

I see what you mean at the 0:25 mark. That intro was also just something I came up with, since I thought the song starting bluntly was, well, blunt. Like being hit by a wet sock. Luckily, this is more to demonstrate song structure and writing. Also, I have to re-dial my soundcard every time I go from bass to guitar, and vise versa. And I do that a lot.

I kind of like my guitars not too warm, since it gives it additional edge. I dislike sawblade distortion and heavy gain djent, so I tried to go with a more thrash-inspired tone, but still with a fair bit of mids, to let the guitar sit tightly in the mix. It's based on a patch I found that tried to emulate Adlers (LoG) tone, and tweaked with the help of Oceill drummer Joel Lindfors. But I have to mention, I haven't changed strings in several months, so my tone is not optimal for that reason. :D

And thanks for following! I just got a date with my vocalist here in 2 weeks time, along with I just ordered a copy of Spectrasonics OmniSphere, so unless anything gaudy happens, I'll have a final, album quality version of ""Incendiary Godsend"" ready and posted here on reddit."
"Diddly evolved; posted a lesser version 2 months ago, now I've added a lot more.","I like the intro and particularly the build up. I just think it should explode when the song gets going because of the anticipation the build creates.

Like I said, if you're happy with the tone of your guitars ignore me. :)  I think vox in there with a final mix will smooth out any of the hard edges I'm hearing anyway. 

Definitely looking forward to hearing your final product!"
"Diddly evolved; posted a lesser version 2 months ago, now I've added a lot more.","Musically this is pretty solid, has good flow, and keeps the listener interested. The production though could use some work. I feel like the drums need some work to properly fill out the sound. They are a little sparse in places, and some more elaborate drums could really add to the heaviness imo. You also mentioned having a lot of mids in the guitar, so that it fits well in the mix. That is a good approach, but when you don't have any bass guitar on the track, it leaves a hole in the sound. If you were to fix up the drums a bit and add some bass, this could be really heavy."
"Diddly evolved; posted a lesser version 2 months ago, now I've added a lot more.","Thanks for the feedback. :)

I actually didn't get around tracking bass for the track, since I've only tracked for 1/3 of it, and didn't want 2/3 of the song to sound lackluster in comparison to the rest; rather have a faily consistent product. Drums are also not quite done in regards to composition.

"Any of you guys use bass cabs for guitar? How does that work out?","I'm a bassist at heart, always will be.  But for the good of my band I'm switching to rhythm guitar and vocals, but I would rather keep a cab I can use for both, I can't see a 215 working well, so what about a 410? I was planning to get one to add on to my wall of bass anyway, how would it sound? ever tried?"

"Metal Pickup Recommendations?","Metal guitarists! What pickups should I get? The EMGs in my Jackson King V have both failed, so I'm in the market. I'd prefer passive pickups this time around, and preferably not at a great cost since the guitar is one of those Japanese-made ones, so I don't think the pickups should be worth more than what I paid.

I figured I'd ask you all since I never really had to put much thought into pickups. I've been happy with what my other guitars have come with (SD Invaders, SD SH4s, DiMarzio Super Distortions...), but now there's a decision to be made!

My styles range across the board from Iced Earth-y to Primal Fear-y to Opeth-y to Morbid Angel-y depending on the band I'm working on ([Burning Shadows](http://burningshadows.com) or [Recently Vacated Graves](http://zombiemetal.com) or one of my unending extra projects)."
"Metal Pickup Recommendations?","JB/Jazz is always a classic combo. Or the Nazgul/Sentient combo, they just released them in 6-string format, if you want something more modern."
"Metal Pickup Recommendations?","I'd get a Nazgul based on the name alone."
"Metal Pickup Recommendations?","I'm pretty tempted to for that reason alone."
"Metal Pickup Recommendations?","Oh, and if you want to minimize the work you need to replace the pups, the new EMG 57/66 set is damn near a passive when it comes to responsiveness. Excellent reviews, I'm putting them in my 7."
"Metal Pickup Recommendations?","I absolutely love the JB/Jazz.  I've A/B'd it with EMG's during recording sessions and the JB sounds way more organic and crunchy."
"Metal Pickup Recommendations?","Love the Nazgul in my 8. Sounds beast."
"Metal Pickup Recommendations?","Crunchlabs, Pegasus', Invaders, Black Winters, Nazguls, Slugs, Distortions? Take your pick, all by Seymour Duncan! Bare Knuckle makes a few as well, I love the Juggernauts. And there's always EMG's, particularly the ALX HZ humbucker sounds awesome imo."
"Metal Pickup Recommendations?","Can personally vouch for the crunchlabs. Really rich dark sound yet super clear. I've got a pair of illuminators in my main guitar now which the next sig pickups in the line, very nice and im loving them but I wouldn't say they are worth the extra $100 if you are going for just a metal sound."
"Metal Pickup Recommendations?","Yeah I can also vouch for the crunch lab, it's beast as fuck"
"Metal Pickup Recommendations?","If we are going metal, I would say the Bareknuckle nailbomb, emerald, or even painkiller are all great.  They are better than the Juggernauts IMO.IT really depends on the wood of the guitar.  Brighter guitars: alnico magnet, draker: Cemeric."
"Metal Pickup Recommendations?","I came here expecting to learn how to pickup girls, but in a metal way.  Mildly disappointed."
"Metal Pickup Recommendations?","I can vouch for Distortion/59, JB/Jazz, and Pegasus/Sentient. Personally I dont like the Jazz at all, but I know some do. Distortion/59 is awesome for 6 strings, but 7+ I would go with Pegasus/Sentient. "

"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","So recently I've been trying to get more serious about recording my music. I don't have a lot of experience, but I've been trying to soak up everything I can about recording heavy music. More specifically- guitars.

I've been going all over youtube looking for tutorials and tips for mixing/mastering/recording. I have a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFP0-yGH-rWdYfE83fvJQRDnUTxr49oRR) here of all the videos I try to reference.

Despite following all the steps and using the same plugins my recording always sounds inferior. I can't figure it out for the life of me.

Here are two recordings I just did-

* [Guitar Test](https://soundcloud.com/user4081301/hibria-guitar-test)
* [Full track test](https://soundcloud.com/user4081301/hibria-master)

The guitar test is just one of my two guitar tracks center panned. The full track test has two tracks panned left and right with rough bass and drums. Here is a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/dmJLqZc.jpg) showing the VSTs I used and their settings.

* TSE808
* TSE X50
* Poulin LeCab2 with Catharsis impulses
* EQ with high pass and low pass

My I use an [Audiobox interface](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/AudioBoxUSB), [Ibanez RG2EX1](http://ibanez.wikia.com/wiki/RG2EX1) (2008-2010 specs), and [JBL SR305](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/LSR305) monitors.

I've gone through multiple tutorials and their end product always sounds better than mine and I don't know why. Mine just seems so much more flat where theirs is so much fuller and richer. I would love to get some feedback or insight as to what I'm missing despite the fact I don't get the same results from following the same tutorial. I really want to get better at this and start producing my music. Thanks in advance!

EDIT- just wanted to emphasis that the videos I've followed all use VSTS, cab sims, and plugins. I'm not watching someone use expensive amps, guitars, and mic and wondering why I sound like shit. If you don't want to go through the playlist I have above, here's a good example. This is the first video tutorial I followed- http://youtu.be/L6PHzkPjH7c. It's just some kid, so I doubt he's using expensive gear. I've followed his steps and used his settings, but my sound is always so much flatter."
"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","FIRST QUESTION: does your guitar have new strings on?"
"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","No. haven't changed the strings in a few months."
"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","That's probably a fair part of it, new strings really help, especially when recording direct and using VSTs.

Also, I think your guitar tone is perfectly usable, but if I were to change one thing I'd go with less gain. It's pretty saturated, which isn't always the best thing.

And by the way, trying to sound like someone else isn't the path to finding your own musical voice; it'll be a good starting point and idea source for tones and techniques, but ultimately your own ears and tastes should determine what you use. Don't sweat that it doesn't sound like the video if it's still good."
"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","&gt; trying to sound like someone else isn't the path to finding your own musical voice

I definitely agree with that. I've been playing and writing music for more than 10 some odd years. It's only recently I started trying to record and set up a little home studio. If i've realized anything it's that production is immense. I'm just trying to use these videos as a starting off point. I realize at some point I'll feel comfortable trying different cabs and settings, but for now I'd like a little but of structure in terms of learning.

Unfortunately there's no book entitled ""learning to produce metal with vsts"". I would totally own that book otherwise.

Perhaps I'm being hard on myself, but I hate feeling like if I could do it better than I should do it better because I really enjoy this. The problem just seems to be that the information is kind of hard to come by. Like I have no idea where in the chain I need to make adjustments and otherwise I feel like I could spend hours turning knobs wondering wtf I'm doing lol. I've certainly considered upgrading my guitar or getting a better interface, but if it's unnecessary I just want to figure out what I'm screwing up."
"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","Honestly, as far as making adjustments in the chain, add and adjust  one thing at a time, and start with the things that most directly affect your tone. So, as far as the VSTs go, start adjusting the amp sim first, for example. Most of the gain and tone shaping happens in there. Once you have that sounding good, try out different impulses, because no matter what you're going to use those. Once you're happy with one of those, if you feel it needs more tightness or edge, back off the gain on the amp Sim and then put the pedal before it. Adjust only that until it sounds good. If you're less happy while it's on, then it's better to not have it. Same with EQ. If you don't feel the EQ adds anything special, leave it. 

(While we're on EQ, [this](http://youtu.be/gdB9iamvk08) is how you subtractive EQ. Use a narrow boost to find a frequency that you don't like, then cut it. It's honestly the best way. And again, if you can't find a frequency you need to remove, you don't need to remove anything.)

But yeah. The basic principle is to make the biggest changes first, keep them, then make more specific adjustments and additions until you're pleased. I hope this is helping.

"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","Well I definitely think it's better! Nice work. Keep at it!"
"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","Good. The best strings for recording are dead strings. Seriously.

I read an EVH interview ages ago where he said the title track to 5150 was recorded on a Flying V because it was the only guitar in the studio that day with dead strings. [You can hear it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxHAN6JIkNo)"
"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","Crank up the mids. A scooped tone will almost always sound flat in my experience. For amp eq, I usually go about 5 bass, 9 mid, and 8 treble. Also a little less gain on the amp and a little more volume on the OD pedal; maybe even consider reducing some drive on the OD pedal. A double tracked tone will sound far clearer and sharper with less distortion. 

Always experiment with new VST amp/cab plugins as well.

Also, consider using a compressor before the OD pedal. Personally I use Guitar Rig 5, but I'm sure you can find free compressor plugins that will work nicely. Your EQ looks pretty good, maybe consider a little boost in the 1-2k range, not much but just enough to give it some sparkle. 
"
"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","This. More mids, slightly less treble than you think you need, way less bass than you think you need (that's what the *bass* guitar is for).

And the OD advice is good too. A little gain on the amp (think over-driven Marshall). Same with the OD, give it a little gain, but crank the volume. This gives you a very dynamic tone with huge amounts of gain, yet clarity."
"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","Awesome. I played around with this a little and i noticed a big difference. Thanks a lot!

2 questions- when you say reduce the amp gain you're referring to the pregain on the X50 right? And I've heard about using compression, but I've never heard about using it at the start of the chain. I think I've only heard about it used at the end after EQ. Am I wrong?"
"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","&gt; when you say reduce the amp gain you're referring to the pregain on the X50 right?

Yes... amp, simulated or real, reduce the pre-amp gain. Honestly, you could probably put it on 3. On the OD, max the volume, put the gain/drive at say 9 o'clock, and the point the tone towards the volume for starters. Adjust as necessary.

&gt; And I've heard about using compression, but I've never heard about using it at the start of the chain. I think I've only heard about it used at the end after EQ. Am I wrong?

I don't know about recording... but for guitar signal, you want compression first - if at all, otherwise you risk compressing the life out of your sound. This may be over simplification, but compression will flatten your sound. You want the effects (gain, distortion, reverb, delay, whatever...) to liven up your sound. You don't want the compression to squash all that."
"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","Yeah, the pre-gain. I'm not familiar with the X50 but I believe the post-gain is just volume essentially. 

Compressors can be used anywhere and have an effect, but when used on the clean signal (at the start of the chain) it will act towards equalizing the volume for all sounds. This is desirable for things like harmonics and not so desirable for things like line noise. I usually use noise reduction before a compressor to make sure anything less audible than, for example, a squeak when sliding from fret to fret does not come through into my signal. Then the compressor boosts and equalizes everything volume-wise, which makes your tone a bit fatter and makes things like harmonics come through clearer. Experiment with the compressor controls until you find a sound you like; I usually don't crank it up very much, just a little compression does the trick most of the time.  

In addition, I often use EQ after my compressor instead of at the end of the chain. It has a far more drastic effect on tone when a clean signal is running through it, and the amp EQ shapes the tone more at the end, which I personally prefer. But these choices are obviously up to you, and if you like the EQ or compression at the end then go for it. You could even have two EQ's or compressors doing slightly different things if you want. "
"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","These are some great tips! I really appreciate it. I'll experiment tonight"
"Despite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?","Just Nick has a [great video about compressors for guitars](http://youtu.be/hMSCKz4GRZY). The talking starts at the [1 min mark](http://youtu.be/hMSCKz4GRZY?t=1m).

His main points, compressors

* reduce attack transient and therefore presence in the mix
* make the signal ""darker""
* even out and ""tighten"" the volume of the signal
* increase apparent overall volume, or increase average volume
* increase sustain

I'm aiming for a little bit different format this time around, since the riff-by-riff approach I used for Iced Earth resulted not only in a pretty substantial workload, but two fairly obtuse wall-of-text posts that I think may have clouded some of the key features of the music. Going forward, I'm aiming to be a little more focused.

If you've enjoyed this and want me to do more, please let me know. Upvotes are great, but comments are better, and what I'm really hoping for is to get some discussion going. I'm also taking suggestions for the next song, and if you have any questions as to something in that song that you want me to look at specifically, so much the better.

I'm not sure exactly when I discovered Serpentine Path, although I'm sure it was not long after the release of their self-titled debut album (from which this track is taken). I'm guessing it was one of the review blogs I was following at the time. I'm a sucker for ultra-slow and heavy doom and sludge, and although I really enjoyed this album, for some reason it didn't make it into my regular rotation. I hadn't given it another listen until /u/outtathaway suggested it for the next Metal Theory post, giving me a good chance to get re-acquainted with some excellent heaviness. I've listened to the entire album several times over the last week while I've been working on this and it's been extremely enjoyable. It's a very focused album, bordering on minimalism. There's nothing going on that isn't aimed at creating maximum weight, and uncomplicated though it is, it's hard to argue with something this heavy.

The two most notable features of the song are the orchestration choices and the use of the blues minor scale. The term ""orchestration"" is used specifically to refer to how music is written or arranged for an orchestra, but it can be used more generally to refer to arranging music for any instrument or collection of instruments and making choices about the music based on those instruments' ranges and timbres (timbre meaning sound quality, the thing that makes a note on a piano sound different from the same note played on a flute). That came up in the last analysis as well: Jon Schaffer's use of modal rather than tonal progression was an orchestrational choice, as it allowed him to make full use of the heavy sound of the open E♭ string.

Let's take a look at the opening riff of ""Crotalus Horridus Horridus"" (which is apparently the scientific name of the timber rattlesnake). Note that this is notated *at pitch*. Guitars are transposing instruments and sound an octave lower than written, but since we're talking about pitch in a general sense here rather than relative to specific instruments, this is notated as it would be played on a piano (a non-transposing instrument). This example shows both the guitar (top line) and bass (bottom line).

[Serpentine Path - Crotalus Horridus Horridus - Riff #1](http://imgur.com/B0rGVhp) 

That even looks heavy. The notes are so low that I had put put the 8vb on there (meaning: these notes are one octave lower than written, making the distinction above re: notating at pitch somewhat academic) just to get the highest notes on the bottom of the clef. Without the 8vb, the entire thing would be notated on leger lines below the staff.  The lowest note that the bass is hitting is A0, the frequency of which is 27.5 Hz, only a little bit about the lowest note that we're able to hear as a distinct pitch (that being E0, the next E down, one octave below the lowest string on a 4-string bass). At that register, much more of the overtone series of the individual pitches is within the range of human hearing, and those overtones are amplified by the distortion, so there's a huge amount harmonic richness here. This is a big part of what facilitates the music being as uncomplicated as it is; we don't need much because there's so much to hear in every note. 

We also have a single melodic line that is doubled an octave below--the bass is playing the same part as the guitar, one octave down. This is similar to the Classical orchestral approach to writing bass lines: often the cellos and the double basses will share the bass part, with the basses doubling an octave below. Melodies as well are often doubled across multiple octaves in orchestral writing for a bigger sound. And in this song that effect is used particularly well, especially when the second guitar comes in doubling an octave above, to get Maximum Heavy out of a fairly straightforward idea. No harmony (aside from the harmonic content of the individual notes), not much rhythmic complexity (although I really dig the cymbal accents on the eighth note after the downbeat), just an effective melodic idea made more effective via octave doubling.

Melodically, all three of the main riffs in this song are structured around a blues approach to the A minor pentatonic scale. That's a very common melodic language in metal, especially in doom and sludge, and can be primarily attributed to the influence of Black Sabbath and the blues lineage from which metal arose. The riff noted above, along with the verse riff (the one played under the vocals when that comes in), make use of one of the key features of the blues: mixed thirds. Most classical and popular music is strictly either major or minor, or alternates between them. Early blues musicians would often play certain notes (usually thirds, fifths, and sevenths) fairly sharp or flat, and as that style got adapted to instruments like the piano (which can't play notes sharp or flat) musicians just used the next note up or down, playing major thirds over minor chords, and minor thirds over major chords, and mixing minor and major thirds (and sevenths, along with similarly inflected fourths and fifths) in melodic lines, as Serpentine Path is doing here. Another riff that comes along later in the song…

[Serpentine Path - Crotalus Horridus Horridus - Riff #2](http://imgur.com/qTJNton )

…uses mixed sevenths, which has a similar effect. When something sounds ""bluesy,"" mixed thirds and sevenths are often the reason why.

The introductory riff also contains a tritone (D♯) as a point of arrival. That's one of those things that makes metal sound like metal. The tritone, due its dissonance and instability, isn't used much in popular music. Until the Baroque era, it was systematically avoided due to its dissonance. In the 17th century it was called *diabolus in musica* (""The Devil in music"") and was seen to have ""evil"" qualities (I've heard some people say that it was outlawed by the Church for this reason, but I've never seen any documentation supporting that). In 18th-century and beyond classical music, and in jazz, the instability of the tritone is used to move from one tonic center to another, so they're transitional. In the blues, as I've mentioned, they're used mostly as passing tones between or inflections of perfect fourths and perfect fifths. Metal is the one genre I know of where that dissonant, evil sound of the tritone is something you resolve *to* rather than *from*. "

"Any tips on mastering? Software, techniques etc?","A few simple rules of thumb... pull all the low end out of your guitars. *All of it*. Too much compression sounds like ass. Louder isn't always better.  A bit of reverb can save the day, or ruin a recording. Use it sparingly.  Recordings tend to use *less* distortion that you would use if playing live. Take that into consideration while adjusting your guitar tones. Pan your guitar tracks, with leads up the middle. Never pan snares and kicks, but feel free to play around with toms and cymbals. "
"Any tips on mastering? Software, techniques etc?","Are these more tips for mastering or for mixing? All this stuff is what I'd do for mixing, but I didn't know I they were also incorporated into mastering. "
"Any tips on mastering? Software, techniques etc?","It's pretty much just mixing.  Maybe OP was confused at the difference and meant mixing?"
"Any tips on mastering? Software, techniques etc?","lol what a truckload of good information. Especially on the distortion and tones, good call.

I would like to add some stuff though, mostly that you can get away with having a little low end in your tones if you're quad tracking with two thin high shelves, or if your bass tone is frail or weak (and you want it that way.) Also, panning all of your drums is a more abstract thing to do but [it can totally be done successfully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16NaOFTIkug)."
"Any tips on mastering? Software, techniques etc?","&gt; done successfully

I'm afraid we have very different definitions of success. The recording would be better with centre panned drums, in my opinion. "
"Any tips on mastering? Software, techniques etc?","Nah man, when you have headphones on and the bass is in one ear and the drums are in another its mind blowing. Totally accentuates the jam feeling.

[There's an old Candlemass album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdVIx8GOLco) where the kick and snare are off center, but not completely left or right. They're on opposite sides, and it adds to the spaciness of it. It's not the kind of thing you would notice though, unless you took one earbud out and listened for it, but I studied this album a bit when I went to go do mixing on my own. Yeah, for headbangable stuff it's usually a good idea to throw them in the center, but again there are enough good examples of the contrary where you can do move them around *with caution*."
"Any tips on mastering? Software, techniques etc?","Now obviously I don't pan all the way, but I usually offset the snare to the left a few clicks. Any reason why I shouldn't do this?"

Thinking that bring my own tunes I’ve been playing for years ISN’T the best way to push this along, it’s really hard to get people on the same page as you. BUT, alas, I have another idea. I’ve been wanting to do something technical for awhile as a challenge. Thinking like Sepultura/Nile but Native American/Indigenous Themed. Technical with tribal drumming, progressive clean parts, my fiancé is Native and we listen to Native Flute on Pandora a lot, maybe some influences from there. Would love to include Aztek/Mayan/Individual tribes/events as topics of songs.

But this seems like a much more plausible non-local collaboration. I havn’t even written a riff for this yet haha, I would do guitar, maybe vocals. I’ve been using Reaper and Amplitube..

I do a lot of random hammer ons/pull offs and incredibly fast tapping in random bursts in cool patterns and stuff like that.

Also something about the way the drums are mixed makes it seem distant and inappropriately subtle. But really, I'm a fan and the whole thing is super creative and original.   "
"Anyone fancy a bit of Serial Killer Metal? Feedback Please!","Thank you! Ye some of the repetition was a bit of a question mark for me. Could not deside what was too much. Alway good to find out lol. Drums were a problem. Not having a kit myself and not having, more importantly, a drummer, I had to stick with finding pre-made Fils and everything. So that NEEDS to change!"
"Anyone fancy a bit of Serial Killer Metal? Feedback Please!","I like it a lot. IMO, I would change the lyrics completely but if that was what you were going for then you are doing great. "
"Anyone fancy a bit of Serial Killer Metal? Feedback Please!","Thanks! Lyrics are a difficult one as I lack access to a mic. Well a good one anyway. Once I do I think I will get round to getting something that i feel fits a bit better."

"Vocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?","Monday night we did some recording and we were hammered and it was absolutely amazing. Tonight we tried to do some more sober and it was an absolute disaster. It's not nerves, our voices just sounded like shit. Do you drink a bit before singing?"
"Vocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?","Generally, yes... I like to have a few beers before/during/after a vocal session. However, if it's gonna be a day long event, I find that the alcohol will tax my voice quicker (and perhaps an alcohol numbed throat makes me scream harder). In that case, I usually start the day with Arizona Ice teas... Weird, i know, but somehow I find it soothes my throat in a similar way to beer."
"Vocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?","Yeah definitely found that I hit like a... this is the best I've got and it was 10 takes ago moment.

I'm a guitarist that's just trying to growl for the first time ever so I don't really know what the fuck I'm doing but it's sounding pretty great, luckily."
"Vocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?","Getting drunk will loosen you up that's for sure, every vocalist i've ever seen telling people how to scream do not recommend any alcohol though.

Warm up for a half hour and drink water is what they say."
"Vocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?","In addition, the water has to be lukewarm. Cold water will just interfere with the vocal cords, and hot water is a cruel mistress. Use some honey too, as it lubricates further."
"Vocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?","Yes, lubricate the throat hole..."
"Vocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?","Nope."
"Vocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?","It's not just singing. A bit of loosening up helps a lot. Otherwise you can be too critical about your musical output, and cheat yourself out of giving your best. 

Overdoing the drinks would have the opposite impact of course."
"Vocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?","No alcohol or drugs- record early in the morning for best result."
"Vocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?","Not if its gonna be a long day, you'll just end up trying to hard and being sloppy. though maybe the odd one here and there towards the end of the session. Energy, now thats what you need!"
"Vocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?","Some sessions ""feel"" better than others and I find that you get better results out of these, drunk or not.  Being wasted and making music is fun &amp; I bet its translated well on a number of recordings. I find that a little booze and smoke before playing helps (and Im a drummer/vocalist) but its a slippery slope because 1 too many beers (or highballs - i love whisky), and your performance, especially live, will suffer."
"Vocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?","Nope, 'cause I know how to fuckin' sing."
"Vocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?","Nope. While I hate making that much noise without my band behind me, no ethanol is required."
"Weired Pickupsound","Hey there, 
I'm working on some recordings with my friend ( we're currently 2 guitar players looking for musicians to start a band)

"Weired Pickupsound","Just sounds like someone's hand moving the strings. Gotta keep them muted during quiet sections. "
"Weired Pickupsound","i mean the high pitch sound during the fast riff 
"
"Weired Pickupsound","It's the noise of the pick hitting the strings.

Here are some suggestions on how to avoid it: http://music.stackexchange.com/questions/624/how-can-i-prevent-the-noise-my-guitar-pick-makes

On the mix, you can look for the frequency where that noise is and equalize it out. There will always be some pick noise, you can only minimize it.

Also, I've noted that the bridge pickup tends to catch this sound more than the neck pickup. Where you hit the string with the pick also impacts this (near the bridge will give you more pick sound)."

If you want to learn how to mix and master stuff, you should just mess around with the sliders and shit in your DAW until it sounds good. It's one of those things you really do have to figure out yourself."
"Would like some advice or maybe references for mixing Metal (late 70's, early 80's inspired) with Pro Tools","I read a bit about panning drums, which were recorded in mono (so they have more natural panning), and trying to have a perceptive as a listener and not just ""how I want it to sound"" when mixing. As I've never used Pro Tools, will there actually be a very limited influence I have outside of leveling the audios? And is theyre anything I can purchase that will process the outcome to a better quality? Am I just talking out my ass? "
"Would like some advice or maybe references for mixing Metal (late 70's, early 80's inspired) with Pro Tools","Listen to some really early stuff, like Rigor Mortis, Celtic Frost, shit that sounds *awful*. Your mixes are gonna sound better than those. I'm serious. By listening to what you should improve rather than trying to imitate Terry Date, you will gather a sense of mixing. "

"Would like some advice or maybe references for mixing Metal (late 70's, early 80's inspired) with Pro Tools","So what I am understanding is, it's really just how much time you spend leveling out and EQing each audio track? Maybe I'm nuking it. Anyways this is all helpful in trying to clear my thoughts. Though really I am looking less at Terry Date and more at Gerry Bron and Derek Lawrence since it seems like what they recorded was more the style we are going for.

"Would like some advice or maybe references for mixing Metal (late 70's, early 80's inspired) with Pro Tools","My point is to not aspire to imitate the big dudes, but the early recordings.

Any suggestions? Thanks."
"Getting ready to get a new amp/stack. I've only used a head with a cabinet before but I'm considering getting a combo--is this feasible?","What kind of gigs do you play?

Maybe try the new [50 watt 5150 III](http://www.evhgear.com/gear/subpage/?partno=2253000400) with a couple of 2x12 cabinets. That way you can scale as necessary and yet have lighter pieces. 50 watts should be plenty loud for almost anything.

50w Tube should be more than enough for that size room. 

Your going to miss your cab, most combos are open back and you won't get as much compression on your low end and it will become loose."
"Getting ready to get a new amp/stack. I've only used a head with a cabinet before but I'm considering getting a combo--is this feasible?","Interesting, it is solid state, I didn't realize there was such a difference between solid state &amp; tube when it came to sound level."
"Getting ready to get a new amp/stack. I've only used a head with a cabinet before but I'm considering getting a combo--is this feasible?","As a rough estimate, use a 4:1 Ratio. 

Your 350w solid state would be comparable to a 87.5w Tube head. 

So if you never had the solid state pegged, a 50w all tube amp should be plenty loud enough for your application. 

If you did have it pegged - go for the 100w. "

Amazing piece.

I can get away with the single AHB-1 for now, but I want to put two active single coils in to compliment solo's, cleans, and crunchy cleans. I'm looking for a bassy midrange punch with clear highs.

Keep in mind that this is the only thing we use to amp our vocals during practices-  it's not as though we're pairing this with monitor wedges for each person in the band, so if you play in a huge band where you would want multiple audio sources during practice, this is probably not the best option."

"Help with producing","Hey guys! I've been told the production quality on my EP sucks. I wanna change that, but I do everything myself and I don't have the money to go to a studio. Do you have any tutorials, freeware or ""freeware"" programs that are good and not too hard to use? At the moment I'm using Ohm Studio on steam."
"Help with producing","Goodness...

Ok, first you shouldn't just have a single, centered guitar track. Even if you're just playing the same thing, add a second track and pan them both. Your guitar lead towards the end should be centered but kept in the mix and not on top of it. 

Second, the playing is sloppy. Don't put out a sloppy product. It doesn't have to be perfect (there are bands that leave slight imperfections) but, as a first time listener, I shouldn't be able to tell you fucked up a riff. "
"Help with producing","Okay. The second song is the sloppiest, imho. I had a really bad day and want to re-record that one asap. And I have all the guitar tracks panned a bit. I'm new to this whole thing."
"Help with producing","Pan them more. Try 85-90% each way. "
"Help with producing","Okay. I'll try my very best. And I'll re-record everything that's sloppy. "
"Help with producing","I just listened to the thing on bandcamp (usually I only listen to the wav/ogg files). The mix is completely fucked up! The drums and bass are almost inaudible! I did NOT mix it like that."
"Help with producing","The internet tends to mess mixes up. What I do it upload it to SoundCloud or band camp and set it to private. Listen to it and see what it sounds like"
"Help with producing","soundcloud is fairly okay. But bandcamp is a cocksucker."
"Help with producing","Link to EP? It would be easier to provide feedback with a point of reference. "
"Help with producing","Here it is, didn't want to seem self-promotional as I've posted it here just a few days ago http://type-40.bandcamp.com/"
"Help with producing","I gave your songs a quick listen. First off, can you give a complete rundown of your set up? I might be able to help more if i know how you're recording.
 Second, it sounds like you're using the drum track from guitar pro. In terms of freeware, check out [Hydrogen](http://www.hydrogen-music.org/hcms/), its a decent drum machine that gets the job done. The initial samples are alright, but aren't too suited for metal. I recommend downloading the 'Death Metal' drum set library. "
"Help with producing","Okay, I'll check that out in the morning. I use a Line6 spider iv 75, Jackson randy rhoads. For recording I use a t.bone sc300, going to a Sony ic recorder over a phantom adapter. And indeed, I use the gp5 drums. The recorder plugs into my laptop where I edit the raw wavs with audacity and mix it all together on ohm studio. "
"Help with producing","I know spending money isn't ideal for you right now, but eventually down the line you're going to need to update your equipment. I'd first look for a recording interface so you can record directly into your pc, making recording sesions easier, and giving the option to use vst tones. Your mic also isn't exactly ideal for metal. Condensers are more suited for precise/sensitive recording, which means you'll be picking up alot more unwanted distortion fizz and overbearing blare usually gotten from micing to close. Try to look for a good dynamic mic (SM57) to add to your arsenal if you have the money.

Now, working with what you have, have you tried skipping the use of the mic? From what i saw, your amp has a sort of direct out/headphone jack, which could be plugged directly into your recorder. Being a digital amp, i would imagine that it would simulate a cabinet tone at output. I would use this instead of micing, as the tone would be more 'intact', making it easier to mix with in Ohm. 
As mentioned by Bronan, i'm curious as to why use audacity? I would imagine Ohm would handle all your needs, and then some. If you hadn't already spent money on Ohm, i would've highly recommended Reaper as well."
"Help with producing","I haven't spent money on Ohm. I use the free version. I don't really need audacity, but I'm used to it. I'll try skipping the mic. I've got the proper adapters and cables and stuff here. Dunno why I've never tried that."
"Help with producing","I tried to skip the whole mic thing.... Just listen for yourself... https://soundcloud.com/rekator/tried-to-record-with-the-headphone-outpout-of-my-amp-and-my-laptop"
"Help with producing","That's...ummm....interesting? The first couple seconds seemed workable. A couple of ideas. Have you tried different settings and gotten the same results? ie. lower gain, lower volume, a clean tone? Second, how are you transferring audio from the recorder to your computer? Are you recording with the recorder, then hooking up the usb to transfer files? Or are you somehow recording via your computer, like in audacity? It sounds alot like one of those two devices is having processing issues while recording."
"Help with producing","I was recording that over the computer. I tried different gain settings, both on the computer and on the amp. Nothing really works. I haven't tried the recorder yet, even though that seems fairly obvious. Lack of sleep does things like that to a person."
"Help with producing","I'm willing to bet it's your computer having recording issues. It never occurred to me until now, but did you record directly from the amp into your laptop's mic jack? If this is the case, and assuming that your sound card is one of those stock built in ones, you're going to have some issues. Most vanilla sound cards can only handle simple audio processing, like voice chatting. Anything closer to real time processing, you will find latency/buffering issues with the card and driver. I used to have a ghetto setup like this when i was starting out, and it was very unworkable. You may be stuck having to record every session on the Sony for the time being if this is the problem."
"Help with producing","Eh, I can do that. Maybe I'll buy a USB sound card, they have those things, right? "
"Help with producing","Yeah, anything like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Focusrite-2i2-USB-Recording-Interface/dp/B005OZE9SA/ref=sr_1_4?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1398987595&amp;sr=1-4) is generally all you need. Something that will specifically appeal to guitar input would be ideal, just be sure to do some product research and check your pc specs are adequate. "
"Help with producing","Don't use Audacity, it is an audio editor, not a DAW. 

[Reaper has a 60 day trial](http://www.reaper.fm/) but the licence lasts forever like WinRAR. It only costs $60 for personal use."
"Help with producing","I just use it to trim the tracks... I can't afford $60 (poor student here)"

"Come rag on my guitar tone! Help me make it better!",""
"Come rag on my guitar tone! Help me make it better!","Sounds okay, serviceable enough for the music, would be better to hear a straight guitar stem as certain areas it becomes to hard to tell if it's the bass or guitar on certain riffs. 

As someone who plays a wide range of genres it's all about picking the right setup for the music in question. As I mentioned. The overall sound here works for the Metalcore type stuff. However I struggle to feel if it'd work with something like Doom or Black Metal. Where with Doom I'd add a bit more low end and a bit more fuzz whereas with BM I wouldn't tune down as low (7 string?), drop the low end, ramp up the gain and Reverb.

I could go on and on. Bottom line. It sounds fine for what you're playing here."
"Come rag on my guitar tone! Help me make it better!","I don't think a universal ""perfect"" metal tone exists for all styles...haha. Thanks for the input though. I wanted a pretty strong mid range, but I've been having trouble with the highs getting too strong and it getting screechy. "
"Come rag on my guitar tone! Help me make it better!","it sounds good to me, definately a good tone for that type of music. "
"Come rag on my guitar tone! Help me make it better!","The tone is seriously heavy. I think if you tweak the EQ on one of them a little bit, it will provide better separation. There are some lower-register riffs that become a bit indistinct. I dig the tone of the cleaner guitar as is.

PS: I read ""Come rag"" and thought /r/guitarcirclejerk. Freudian slip?

"
"Come rag on my guitar tone! Help me make it better!","That's actually a pretty good tone. What kind of hardware and settings/amp sims did you use to get this tone?"
"Come rag on my guitar tone! Help me make it better!","I don't think I can find a single thing wrong with the tone, it sounds great!

What gear are you using?"
"Come rag on my guitar tone! Help me make it better!","Clear and distinct tone - I like it - a lot. The low A notes have a good punch to them, and the highs are crystal clear. A little more work on the separation of the tracks would make them stand out even more, but damn, I just got to around 2:45 and that's some seriously heavy tone. What kind of EQ/amp simulation are you using?"

For the video the center track tone, which you hear the most, was made with Poulin VST if I remember well.

Left/Right tracks were recorded with the Sunn and Laney, and we added a 3rd track using the Laney and Peavey.  Shit sounds huge.  I like each rig enough that I'm now in the market for an A/B/C/y pedal so I can play all 3 simultaneously live.  "
"My guitar rig for a recent recording session. We play doom/sludge.","turned around the cover on the tripleX , , i did the same."

"My guitar rig for a recent recording session. We play doom/sludge.","I'm in the process of building a doom rig, would love to hear how this came out.

Did you re-amp through all these at once or did you send the signal 3 different times?

Are you using any pedals to get to your tone? 

How'd you get to the conclusion of running the 2x15 with the XXX?

With the Sunn being a bass amp did you run into any issues with that?

My current rig right now that I'm messing around with is:
Fender Bassman 100
Marshall Cab w t75s
Krank Krankenstein
Mesa recto w v30s

I wonder if I added my 8x10 ampeg and my Peavy VB-2 to the mix but have no idea how I would split the signal a  third time (currently using a chorus pedal with stereo outs to do the split now)"
"My guitar rig for a recent recording session. We play doom/sludge.","I used an A/B/Y box to go to 2 amps at a given time.  Of the 3 guitar tracks recorded for each song, 2 were cut using the Sunn + the Laney, while the 3rd was cut using the Laney + the Peavey.  Pretty much the only pedal I used this session was a Superfuzz clone made by wattson.  That pedal sounds huge.  I also used a pigtronix class A boost for a lead at one point.  The sunn rig actually strips out much of the high end coming from my guitar and functions as almost a clean bass sound to offset the guitar sound from the laney.  The XXX through the 2x15, by contrast, has a dirty bass sound, so all three rounded things out nicely.  I got the idea to run the XXX through the 2x15 from having previously sent guitar heads through it with good results in the past.  I bought the cab off a friend in Primitive Man, and he had told me to give a guitar head a shot through it, so I did.  

Look into getting an A/B/Y box to split your signal.  I'm considering getting the Voodoo labs pedal [in this link](http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B000CSPP5U/ref=smi_ge_rl_btns1_setch?_encoding=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;pldnNew=1) as it can run up to four heads simultaneously.  "
"My guitar rig for a recent recording session. We play doom/sludge.","Thanks for the info. Was actually able to assemble mine a bit this weekend. ended up with two 4x12's and my 8x10 running at once. Massive. 

"
"My guitar rig for a recent recording session. We play doom/sludge.","I love that combination.  There's nothing like standing in front of a monolithic wall of cabs and feeling your shirt move from all the air you're pushing.  "
"My guitar rig for a recent recording session. We play doom/sludge.","How the hell do you keep the thing quiet?

I hooked up my setup with a Black Arts Toneworks Destroyer pedal and I get an unbearable hum/feedback and the Oath side of the pedal doesn't allow my Noise Gate to even close it's pushing so hard. 

Any ideas? Or do you just play thru it and turn off your drive pedals when your not playing? "
"My guitar rig for a recent recording session. We play doom/sludge.","The quality of your a/b/y setup has a lot to do with it.  When I first started experimenting with multiple amp setups I bought the cheapest a/b/y box I could find.  It worked, but there was significant amp buzz whenever I had both rigs running.  I then picked up a Radial Bigshot a/b/y which has an on board transformer as well as settings to help phase match amps, and that helped considerably.   Ground loops cause a ton of excess noise with these setups, but decent a/b/y boxes will eliminate them.  "
"My guitar rig for a recent recording session. We play doom/sludge.","I'll look into that for sure. 

Tried running just the pedal straight in to just one amp - same issue. Thinking I've got some wicked back ground loop going on somewhere in the rig. Gonna demo it with my live rig for the other band and see if it does the same thing. "
"My guitar rig for a recent recording session. We play doom/sludge.","I would bet that a lot of the noise is coming from splitting your signal from that chorus pedal.  A decent A/B/Y box is a worthy investment, and your rig will sound immense without a ton of superfluous racket going on.  "
"My guitar rig for a recent recording session. We play doom/sludge.","Do you use any kinda of noise gates, compression, ect?

I want to use this rig live at some point ya know. Might need to check my cables from bad grounds."
"My guitar rig for a recent recording session. We play doom/sludge.","Checking cables is always a good call.  At this point, no, I'm not running anything like that.  I've used noise supressor pedals on occasion in the past, but this hasn't been a huge issue for me with the current rig.  It'll feed back like a motherfucker if I have the fuzz on and am standing close to the heads, but that's something I'm also actively going for, and I use the feedback sounds live in conjunction with neck bends and other techniques like punching the body of the guitar to get cool noises from it.  "
"My guitar rig for a recent recording session. We play doom/sludge.","Thanks for all the info - i'm a fuckin greenhorn when it comes too doom rigs. Been playing metal my whole life and it's nice.

"Machine Head Vocal Lessons?","I know that before Unto the Locust, Robb got vocal lessons with Melissa Cross and his voice is better than ever! She does instructional DVDs called The Zen of Screaming. The 2nd one goes into a more detailed look into different styles, but the first one is necessary so you don't do any damage to your voice (which is incredibly easy to do if you're screaming the right way)"
"Machine Head Vocal Lessons?","Highly recommend Zen of Screaming as well, but you can start by mimicking the sound of his harsh vocals. Try starting at a whisper level for a while. Eventually, start to push more air out of your diaphragm. Practice breathing exercises before you even think about this part. "

"Some basic recording questions","These are probably pretty dumb questions but I just wanted to check.

So I understand that for rhythms typically you'll double track, panning one to either side. Is this also the case for harmonized rhythms? (For example, you would have two guitar tracks still, panned to either side, and one side would be the lower rhythm and the other side would be the higher rhythm?)

Also for leads I understand that typically you just single track the leads in the center. For harmonized leads, would you have two centered tracks, or would you pan the two tracks left and right?

Sorry for the very basic questions!

"
"Some basic recording questions","The answers to these questions lie with you, I think! Experiment to see what sounds best for your music. I've heard songs where they do a lot more than double tracking. Sometimes you hear upwards of eight tracks split over both sides. 

In regards to the harmonized rhythms thing, I think it's pretty common to do what you described (two tracks either side, one for each harmonized part). If you wanted to, you could quad track, and have each part represented twice on both sides. That might sound pretty cool.

For leads, a single track center is common. If it's a harmonized lead, I would definitely have each part panned. I like the ""dueling guitarists"" sound, but that's just me. Make sure in this case that you do something different with the rhythm part, as the hard left and right areas of your recording could get kind of crowded. 

Good luck!"
"Some basic recording questions","My approach is to have 5 guitar tracks (possibly more if clean and other effects are introduced, but I treat those as extras). Two are rhythm tracks, panned hard left and hard right. Two are lead tracks panned about 50% left and right (so they don't occupy the rhythm guitars sonic space). And the last one is a centralized lead (solo) guitar. 

When I want harmonized rhythms, I typically just have them panned and shove them on their individual hard panned tracks. If I have a harmonized lead, I use the two 50% panned lead tracks. If I have a single lead, I will either use the two tracks and double track it (this is useful when you are going to introduce harmonies later, then you don't have to change tracks and dramatically alter the volume/sound) or put it on the solo track. 

This covers 99% of all recording situations for heavy guitars. Unless you really want harmonized rhythm guitars equally in each ear (which you would probably have to quad track), this works basically all the time. Clean and other sounds I tend to do more on an individual basis."
"Some basic recording questions","Yngwie's harmonies are always panned. Now it's pretty much the law when it comes to intricate harmonized lead lines."

Thanks in advance dudes!"

4 string: GSR200 or GSR300

5 string: SR 305

If your looking for a bass amp. Acoustic has been putting on good quality models for cheap in the last couple of years.  "
"Beginner metal bass?","Ibanez also has the Promethean line of bass amps, which are small but powerful. Great for practicing and recording."
"Beginner metal bass?","Metal basses are a less specific and necessary category of instrument than metal guitars, and by that I mean that most decent quality basses will work for Metal, as they will for almost all genres. 

That said, one thing you may want to consider is that you're probably going to like basses with a more aggressive, brighter, and more articulate tone more for Metal. I'd personally avoid basses made by or like those made by Gibson or Epiphone, which tend to have a mushy, bass-heavy tone without much attack (and horrible balance to boot!) 

The Ibanez basses already suggested are great, I play one myself. The Sterling by Music Man S.U.B. basses are also really great playing and sounding for the money in my opinion. The Squier Affinity Series Precision Bass PJ and Vintage Modified Precision Bass PJ are also quite affordable, versatile, and even simpler than anything else that's been suggested (they lack active electronics.)"
"Beginner metal bass?"," Thanks! This is really helpful. "
"Beginner metal bass?","If you go for one of the squires, pay a bit more for the vintage modified. The affinity series has a bad reputation of quality control, and /r/bass sings plenty of praise for the vm as one of the best bang for your buck basses you can get.

Edit: I also second all the ibanez recommendations. I love my sr505 and it works great for metal (and jazz and funk and whatever else I want to play). "
"Beginner metal bass?","I have an Epiphone SG 5-string that kinda belays that description you're giving.  It was literally left at my house after being abused at the hands of some kids.  5-way pickup selector was shot to shit so I wired the pickups hard series to a volume control each, then to a master tone.

[Here's a random riff with the bass](https://soundcloud.com/sinstrousstudio/riff-9-17-14)"
"Beginner metal bass?","Another vote for Ibanez here. I have an SRX2EX2 (discontinued I believe) which is a killer bass. The neck feels great and it looks sweet as well (white with black binding). The neck and the light weight of the bass itself made learning really easy."
"Beginner metal bass?","Greg Bennett Fairlane FN 1 5-String"
"Beginner metal bass?","a nasty overdrive will make most basses work well for metal

make sure you have a good EQ so you can fix your tone to sit just right with a wall of guitars

i use a soundgear with an audere preamp put into it for more aggressive music."

Vinny here from [ORE FM](http://ore.fm) – Metal From The Underground. [I posted about a month ago about ORE FM]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/2exr39/my_brother_and_i_are_creating_a_radio_station_app/), which is a mobile app myself, my brother and a few friends have been working on. ORE FM is a location based music player that will stream localized metal bands based on the listeners location. The feedback we have been receiving from the metal community has been tremendously positive and enthusiastic and we have been working our asses off to create something that is not only cool but also feature packed and functional. At this point, I am excited to say we are ready for bands to beta test our website and app. If you are in a metal band and willing to help out, please send an email to: Beta@ore.fm and include the following information:

* Your bands location/home town
* How many band members you have
* Are you using Iphone or Android devices 

You will be required to fill out a questionnaire after testing to report any bugs or issues you have come across and of course, we have some goodies set aside for our testers. More information will be provided about the testing via email.  If you have any questions about ORE FM, feel free to post and we will do our best to answer.

"Seeking drummer - Austin TX Area","Please let me know if this is in violation of the subreddit. Fairly new to posting.


Extremely long time lurker, first time poster, have just recently created an account for my band Anton's Key. Hence the name.


TL;DR of it all, drummer has moved away to pursue school/academia, we are looking for a replacement.

Band is damn near fresh however we are all veterans of various projects, mostly metal oriented/influenced. We are in the process of congregating to Austin, TX. Some of us live across the state, but that is changing in the next month so we want to go full force, just need a badass drummer and all that :). We have a handful of songs written, 1 fully recorded (fake drums) along with a shit-ton of riffs and testosterone because we haven't played a show in a while. It's all DIY at this point, but we are looking for someone who is interested in touring and pushing the envelope as far as it will go.

If you would like to have a listen, our recording can be heard here: https://soundcloud.com/antons-key-band/battousai-the-wanderer

If you would like to know more about our influences, schedules, ideas, favorite beers, feel free to drop a note or PM the bands account, I'll check it regularly. If you even just know a guy who knows a guy, I'd love to hear about his drumming, we are open minded in our search and appreciate any help.
Once again if this post is disallowed from some rule I am unaware of, please let me know and I can relocate it, or remove it.

Thanks,

"My band dropped our first track, we kinda draw from Mastodon and Opeth a lot","Yea, I have to agree, a lot of the riffs are structurally useless, they just seem to be dropped in place without any thought given to the overall flow of the song. From about 2:00 - 4:57 sounds cohesive but the rest of it is just riff salad. On the up side, a lot of the riffs are pretty good, I am not a fan of the 'In flames'y string skipping' riffs but that's really just my opinion, I find that style of riffing has been done to death in recent years. There is potential, just keep working at it."
"My band dropped our first track, we kinda draw from Mastodon and Opeth a lot","Sorry, I don't hear much of the mastodon/ opeth influence. Also it kind of sounds like a bunch of random riffs to form a song. "
"My band dropped our first track, we kinda draw from Mastodon and Opeth a lot","I like everything from 2:15ish to 4:55.  I certainly hear the Opeth influence in the riff at 5:15 with the lead over.  I dig it.  I agree with the other comments that there could be some smoother transitions but I think that middle section I mentioned is very strong.  The ending is kind of uneventful though.

also the guitar tone could use a bit less gain if you ask me. Just my taste though.

would listen to again. keep at er, fellas."
"My band dropped our first track, we kinda draw from Mastodon and Opeth a lot","I'm hearing way more All That Remains and Gothenburg roots than I am any kind of sludge or prog.

Something seems a bit funky with the guitar.

As others have said, it doesn't feel very cohesive. The opening in particular seems pretty riffy without much of a reason. Musicianship seems solid though. Work on trying to tie together the theme of the song more."

Also, wikipedia disagrees with you... 

""Djent /ˈdʒɛnt/[1] is a style of heavy metal music that developed as a spinoff of traditional progressive metal.[2][3]""

Therefore, ""mostly Djent"" would imply progressive and metal."

POD HD500, SD2, Trillian... Let me know what you think!","I mean, I think it sounds pretty similar to a lot of prog metal I listen to, namely the bands I listed as influences in the title.

I wouldn't expect vanilla metal to break from heavy and fast to an odd chord progression with dissonant bass and melody over it.

The only part of this that I think could be classified as ""djent"" is only a small portion of the song and is much more similar to Meshuggah than to other ""djent"" bands like monuments/intervals/whatever other trendy thing that's going on right now. 

And the point has been made, but djent is a subgenre of prog metal. So saying that it's mostly djent but not prog metal, doesn't really seem to make much sense. 

I'm definitely open to criticism and I welcome it, but I would prefer it to be constructive and coherent when I do receive it. Perhaps I shouldn't label the music anything and let it speak for itself!

I was in a serious band for a really long time, and these days I just like to make stuff for the hell of it.

It's not grind stuff, but it'll show you some of what I can do with drum programming. Honestly, making grind/blast beat type stuff is easier because blast beats are a lot of cut and paste and just changing the velocities on certain things, so we can make it happen for sure, and I'm sure we can make something pretty interesting. We just got to stay committed because I know a lot of people try this online stuff, and the interest falls off once people start lagging. "

I suggest that you (and the drummer) do a bit of research on ways to avoid cyclical traps... repeating a riff 4 times then moving on to the next one... you want fills on all instruments and variations on the riffs to play against listener expectations.  I also recommend changing your tag from thrash to melodic death and getting a grunty beast of a vocalist... no -core vocals... you want earth shaking roars... not castration screams!

I like it.  Do more."

I agree with you about the transitions. That's my weak point. This was the first project me and my drummer ever did together, so for the next stuff we should have even better chemistry. 

I had been greatly trying to figure out what kind of vocalist I needed. If you think a hard roarer is the way to go, I can see about that. "

I am recording with a Fender Mustang 1 amp that has a lot of presets and effects, a usb to plug into a computer, and gain, bass, treble, volume, and master volume knobs and a Ibanez GR-something. When I try to record into Logic Pro X (only DAW I have), the palm mutes sound really static-y and the tone ends up really bleh. I am wondering if I need to invest in something like POD Farm or get a new amp. I am hopefully getting a job soon but for the meantime my budget is $100-$150. Any ways i can fix this? I really want to start jammin' :("
"I need help with everything","Simple things that might help when you're going DI.

No idea on your amp but start out around 5 6 8 for bass mid treb and adjust until you think it sounds better. Keep the gain at the lowest you gain to do everything you need. Throw a HP and LP on the tracks you're recording and do at least 2 tracks hard left and hard right. Got any samples to show? 


Edit: If you're unhappy with Logic for whatever reason check out Reaper"
"I need help with everything","Here is a guitar snippet from the first track I'm working on: ""Imminent Death"" https://soundcloud.com/deadguyfromdeadgirl/snippet-from-imminent-death

Feedback welcome."
"I need help with everything","Its try lowering the gain a bit and maybe the treb if you still get that high hiss/buzz notch it out with eq"
"I need help with everything","You could get a used peavey vypyr and go with Reaper as your DAW, I have that set up (including an Ibanez GRG121EX) and I think my tone is quite tolerable. Check my profile to find some of my music (would link but I'm on mobile -_-) it does require a lot of trial and error to find a tone you like enough to record with unless you already have an amazing rig."
"I need help with everything","Logic Pro is about 1000 times better than reaper. So probably just stick with that if you got it. "
"I need help with everything","A DAW is a DAW it doesn't matter which one you use. I constantly switch between Pro Tools and Reaper depending on what I am doing for ease of use/plugins."
"I need help with everything","I would highly suggest eith amplitube or pod farm. Personally I use amplitube and I love it. "
"I need help with everything","Go here: http://lepouplugins.blogspot.com/ Get the free guitar sims. He's got a couple different amps that all sound really good. You will also need to grab the Cab sim as well. If you're not sure how to get it all working, there should be several vids on youtube to get you running. Also go here: http://www.tseaudio.com/software/x50v2 and  get the free TSE tube screamer and BOD bass overdrive. What are you using for drums?
"
"I need help with everything","No one I know plays drums (or can but not very well), but I do have an electronic drum set that I found on the side of the road that surprisingly works! It doesn't have a usb, so it must be old. But another alternative to drums that I have is using the drum design and kits on a maschine studio. Worst comes to worst, I will use my friend's old drum set, but I would have to get a bigger interface and more mics."
"I need help with everything","Look into Steven Slate Drums and/or The Metal Foundry if you want to program the drums. I also highly recommend getting a good interface for everything you want to do."
"I need help with everything","If you have Logic Pro X, just use the drum samples they have included. They don't sound all that bad and will definitely sound better than any live drums you'd record. Recording live drums is very difficult. If you have any cash, I strongly, strongly recommend EZ Drummer 2. "
"I need help with everything","Recording live drums is extremely easy where are you getting that it's difficult? It all depends on what sound you are going for and for metal I would go with a real kit or at least appropriate samples or it's never gonna mix well. SSD has really good kits for metal and there's also the Metal Foundry."
"I need help with everything","Yeah your going to need pod farm or something, i know getting a good guitar tone is a fucking bitch.  There is some free vst plugins you could try TSE and LePoulin just youtube it"
"I need help with everything","Please don't listen to this guy. Contrary to popular belief, *you can actually record without POD*."

"Help me help you!","Hi all, I have been mastering records for 7 years and doing sound for 22 years, and tho I get the occasional Metal band, the bulk of my work is everything else, meaning Classical, Hip Hop, Singer/Songwriter, etc. 

I am a metalhead and listen mainly to Metal and Industrial. [This is a little playlist of things I have mastered](https://soundcloud.com/juliandavidsilvaromero/sets/mastered-at-on-air-mastering) Metal in there would be A Storm of light, Fear report, Under threat, if I'm not mistaken. 

Going thru this sub, I had the idea of offering one free mastered song, given that you are 100% happy with the mix, tho, shit, send it and i'll listen to at studio and give feedback! 

This is for me to offer more samples of mastered Metal and to get even to be the ""go-to"" guy for Metal, like Terry Date when you want immense, in your face guitars. There's not one young mastering engineer here in NYC that does Metal, so why not me?

"Help me help you!","Excellent, I will. 
"
"Help me help you!","Ok, I m listening now. 

I think the low end needs *defining*, I need to hear the notes the bass is doing. 

Then I think you have a better, fuller sound. Better than me telling you to lay down the bass tho!

I think the balance of guitars and voice is really good, keep that. 

I need to hear the TU-PAH of the drums, it's buried, unless that is your color, then leave it. 

Hope this helps! "
"Help me help you!","First off thanks a lot! Now for the funny part . . .

&gt;I think the low end needs defining, I need to hear the notes the bass is doing.

There is no bass. I don't want to use a programmed bass and I don't own a bass, so my solution was no bass. For the non demo (which I hope comes together eventually) there will be bass, and no I will not give it the Newsted treatment.

The drums are programmed using the worst drum machine in the world - guitar pro's RSE. It sucks due to the programs attempt at introducint ""realism"", where they have 2 drum sounds for every component (snare, bass, etc.) and the chance of a certain ""hit"" being played is probability based. The issue is that the sounds are not levelled, like 1 snare hit is louder than the other, and that's why it sounds like the snare is dropping in and out on blast beats every now and then. The ""fix"" that I imagine for this is to separate all the individual parts (bass, snare, cymbal) into 3 tracks before mixing and compressing each one so it is even.  Unfortunately, that's work that I don't really want to do.

Again, the (eventual) studio version will have a real drummer, so no worries there."
"Help me help you!","Oh, perfect. I really enjoyed the music, tho, I am sorry I didn't comment on it at all. Sound is sound, for me, and music is music. 

I have done sound for many bands that forgo the bass and instead they use an octave pedal or something of the sort. Don't sound bad, tho. "
"Help me help you!","Hey thanks a lot man. I get what you mean the two, especially after taking a class on music production. There's a huge different between a song and a track.

"Vocal recording for people who can't sing","Hey guys, I'm in the process of recording vocals to finish my band's doom album. Thing is, me and the other bandmates don't know what we're doing, all of us sound pretty horrible taking on vocals. We mainly have concerns about mixing, but improving amature vocals is really our main goal here.

Here's me on a couple of takes:

1
https://soundcloud.com/vincent_wisehoon/pblsample1

2
https://soundcloud.com/vincent_wisehoon/pblsample2

So here's the thing: My voice is obviously not that great, but I felt it at least fits the theme of weakness and sounds frail enough for a doom album. But there are still things I could do to capitalize on that effect. So for both takes, there is a boost in the high-mids for that radio'd type nasally sound, which I'm okay with I guess, but is there a way to get the vocals to sound more dry and up front without making it painfully obvious that my technique isn't good? 

Second, I like the tone of the first take more, but I barely sung on that, it was really more of a loud talking. When I put the real power into my voice in the second take, I don't think any of it came through. I was obviously more prepared the second time, and it shows in the rhythm and intonation, but when I was sloppier, it sounded nicer. Do I not have to necessarily belt out all my singing?

Finally, for both takes (I believe), I mildly reduced the volume of some of the guitar tracks at periods where I was singing. Is this a good idea? Someone told me I don't want my vocals to fight with the frequencies making up the guitars and distortion (obviously), but that makes me wonder how a band like Electric Wizard can have tons of loudness and distortion and still lay vocals on top of that. That's why I went with the school of just making them sound thin and frail, but they're still pretty unclear. Basically I don't know whether or not I should be messing with the volumes of everything else to make the vocals pop out.

I'm pretty sue if we can't figure this out we're going to start hunting the internet for someone who can actually sing."
"Vocal recording for people who can't sing","Ok. I actually like your voice man. I don't think you sound as bad as 'you' think you do. I'm guilty of that myself. Your issue isn't ""we need to find someone that can sing"", your issue is ""we need to figure out how to make these vocals best sit in the mix"". There are tons of blogs and websites you can google to get EQ tips, etc. For your takes, sing with passion, sing with confidence, alternate between power and restrained with the flow of the music. You don't have to sing like Freddie Mercury to be a great vocalist. Look at like...Neil Young. Dude is NOT a good singer. He's just expresses his honesty/passion. And, that's ALL it really comes down to. Good Luck. "
"Vocal recording for people who can't sing","There are a lot of tutorials online. Drone and doom are pretty straightforward genres. I listened to your takes and could barely hear the vocals, could you maybe turn down the guitars almost all the way down? I'd love to be able to hear the vocals and give you normal criticism.

Vocals are usually compressed once you've decided on a take. You can try sidechaining too. It makes the volume process automatic. You set how far you want to decrease the guitar volume in relation to the vocals."
"Vocal recording for people who can't sing","Also donc forget that mastering comes after the mixing step, and anyway will crush down the dynamics. It means, if your mix is done properly, that the volume of the instruments will be lower when the voice comes in.

By the bay I liked your singing. It's not my style but it sounded ok to me. Reminded me of Ghost in a way."
"Vocal recording for people who can't sing","Why not have a mixer mix it? I guarantee the end product will be far superior than you thought it could be."

"Our bands first song. Any criticism is immensely appreciated.","I think the drummer needs to step it up a notch... it's not driving the song as much as it should"
"Our bands first song. Any criticism is immensely appreciated.","The vocals need to be a little more 'aggressive' in the sense that the tone of the vocals needs to be dirtier."
"Our bands first song. Any criticism is immensely appreciated.","Fucking metal! That's how you riff it up man. Compress the vocals a bit though man. And add reverb or some bass or something. They could pass as black metal or something. With the right production, you could get an album to sound as fast and heavy as like a Skeleton witch song."
"Recording with a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 [x-post from r/audioengineering]","Hey guys. I just got a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 for recording stuff. If any of you guys use it, I've got a couple of questions:

1. Is it a good idea to hook a guitar to a DI box, and then send the DI output to the 2i2 through an XLR cable?
2. What's the +48V button for? Is it for powering mics?
3. If I plug my guitar straight into the 2i2, is it better to switch the channel to ""Line"", or "" Inst""? Because I was getting a lot more clipping and gain when using the ""Inst"" setting."
"Recording with a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 [x-post from r/audioengineering]","Hey, I have the Scarlett 2i4 which is the same thing with an extra set of stereo outputs and it's a great little box, so here we go!


* 1 &amp; 3. I use a DI box but really only because I don't have any zero latency plug-ins for amp simulation, meaning there is a small delay from when I'm playing to when the sound comes out of my speakers. Usually it's only a few milliseconds, but depending on your play style and your own preferences the delay can really make it tough to record. I record with a DI and have my POD300 to use for monitoring. I'm not too big a fan of what comes out of the POD for amp sims so the DI is perfect. If you have a similar situation then the DI is a must. However, if you don't have any issues playing with latency or are perfectly fine playing and only hearing the dry guitar signal, then there's no need for a DI. You can plug the guitar directly into the 2i2 and set it to inst(rument). You want to use instrument when recording a direct guitar sound because it has a much lower output than a line level signal. The extra boost you get from it is for you guitar's signal to be properly converted to digital. If it's too hot then roll back the volume on the input, if it's still too hot the unit also has a pad which will lower the volume a bit. As far as I know though, the difference between the two settings is a volume adjustment, so if it's working fine when you have it set to line and still sounds fine after you've added effects there probably won't be too much of an issue. Don't be afraid to experiment! Record a few different tracks with line and instrument. Adjust the input volume on the Scarlett to work with each setting and treat it as you would in your DAW and go with what works best. If there's something I'm missing with the line vs instrument setting, someone please feel free to chime in.
* 2. You're exactly right about the +48v button. It's typically used for condenser mics which are usually used for vocals, though you may use them for other things. These require power to be sent to them to operate, though they aren't necessarily the only ones that are like this. That button merely turns on phantom power which powers the mic through your XLR cable. 

Hope this helps!"
"Recording with a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 [x-post from r/audioengineering]","Last night, I recorded tracks in both the Line setting and the Instrument setting. I noticed that with Instrument, the sound was heavier and more distorted, but I could still hear quite a bit of hum and buzz in the track. When I used Line, the sound was clearer, but I had to the turn the gain knob up quite a bit to get a good, heavy sound. What I'm wondering is (aside from what VST plugins I'm using) what will happen if I plug the guitar into a DI box, take it's output, and send it to the 2i2 with an XLR cable as Line input? Will that make my guitar sound cleaner in the mix?"
"Recording with a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 [x-post from r/audioengineering]","When using XLR, the scarlett ignores the line/inst switch completely so wherever that's set it won't matter. Using the DI is going to give you a lower signal than using the instrument input which will probably have a similar effect to using line in. Less distortion but very clear. your best bet is to use the instrument in with a noise gate somewhere in your effects chain to help tame some of the excess noise. Some amp sims have a noise gate built into them, so look for that, otherwise you recording software will likely have one included with it's plug-ins"
"Recording with a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 [x-post from r/audioengineering]","I have a 2i4 so pretty much the same deal. The 2i2 IS your DI. Guitar -&gt; 2i2 -&gt; computer is how I do it. Then use something like Guitar Rig or Amplitube to add the amp modeling stuff. If you have an amp you want to use, then yeah mic it up and use the +48V (Phantom Power) on any condenser mics. Otherwise leave the +48V alone. Plug into the Inst channel with your guitar unless your pickups are crazy hot (my own opinion, just pick what sounds best for you)."

I never imagined myself as a guy playing any instrument in a band, I've always focused more on vocals, and it so just happened that in high school a friend who was into metal too heard me growl on top of something while drunk one friday night and asked if I'd like to join his band. He had been the bassist-vocalist up until that point. The first months I sucked bad, had never played with a band before, just growling and shrieking alone on top of my favourite songs.

Our first demo was pretty horrible, in retrospect, but damn it if I wasn't proud of it back then. It sort of kept my motivation up, believing I would improve with time, and after 7 years in the band and listening back to the first demo, I can proudly say I have. 

I like the guys in my band, we share a lot of bands we like (with me being the only exception who really listens to black metal), and we go well together as a band. And that is all that matters.

Other than that, you may be running into issues with clipping your mic or internal soundcard, or phasing issues depending on how you record. It's hard for me to get what you're describing without hearing it."

"Any advice on first drum kit?","My brother-in-law is interested in getting a drum kit to start messing around. He'll occasionally ask me questions, but I'm not much of a resource. I play bass and a little bit of guitar, so I really haven't a clue regarding percussion equipment or anything technical. I don't think he has any interest in taking lessons, but seems pretty motivated to at least be able to jam a little bit for fun. He's into thrash/hardcore/black. He's ok with buying used and has a budget around $500USD. Is there any advice to be offered regarding brands? Are there opinions on procurement? For instance, should he focus on getting a kit or piece together higher-quality components? Any thoughts on specific components? Should he plunge right into double bass or hold-off? Thanks in advance!"
"Any advice on first drum kit?","Drummer of 18 years here.  Any cheap kit will do for learning purposes.  He will likely break down any cheap kit you buy so buying something to learn on will be great while he starts to build a kit he really wants to play on.  The logic here is that after he refines his techniques on the cheap kit, his good kit will last longer because he will be less rough on it.  "
"Any advice on first drum kit?","Start with an entry-level kit...  Many are high quality and are available for under $500

"Any advice on first drum kit?","Not a drummer but am in a band with a highly proficient one. He's always said to me that it's best to learn single kick drum first, so that you get a good understanding of what you can do with just one pedal before you start to see what you you actually need a double pedal for. I've known a bunch of drummer to be able to do the standard thrash beat using a single pedal by utilising the ball and heel independently "
"Any advice on first drum kit?","pretty much anything on Craigslist that isn't obviously a kid's set or really broken will be fine, I started on a Walmart First Act set and managed to get decent before it was too broken to play so quality really doesn't matter too much. you should be able to get a complete set cymbals and all for a few hundred bucks. No sense getting a double bass pedal right off but if the set you find happens to come with it then go for it"

"Writing complimentary riffs","Hi guys, I'm writing a tech death / melo-death song at the moment (think Arsis or TBDM murder type stuff) with my band. We have one guitar part down and the drum track is pretty much done as well, but we're having oodles of trouble working out riffs that compliment (rhythmically and harmonically) the existing riffs. We're aiming for some riffs that could be played simultaneously but sound good togather. 
Any general tips?"
"Writing complimentary riffs","I wouldn't over complicate it if it doesn't need to be anything more than what you have, just double the guitar part. I'm a big TBDM fan and a lot of their guitar parts are where both guitars are playing the same kinda riff, but the other is harmonising the melody but playing the same root note where there are some.. If you get me.."
"Writing complimentary riffs","You could ""deconstruct"" the main riff, maybe simplify it and the tweak the tonality so it's in a different harmonic relation and start building the new riff from there. Or use the original riff played at half or double time as a starting point."
"Writing complimentary riffs","Can I hear it? I play melodeath and can help you out. You can. Check out some of my old posts if you'd like. If it's harmony/melodic support that you need, I can do that lol. "

"Writing complimentary riffs","It's better than nothing I guess. We can give it a shot. "
"Writing complimentary riffs","Learn your scales. It's usually not that hard once you know them. Harmonizing riffs is really just picking out all the notes a certain number of degrees higher than the original. But if I have any kind of useful tip at all: Just because you can harmonize everything, doesn't mean you have to. Sometimes just having a bunch of really huge power chords in unison is way more headbangable than altering the riff a thousands different ways until it's essentially a chord,"
"Writing complimentary riffs","Yeah, I'll try harmonizing a couple more of the riffs. Also, a lot of the commenters, you included, have warned me not to overcomplicate the song, so that seems to be worth paying attention to haha. Cheers though
"
"Writing complimentary riffs","I mean it's the sort of thing that's become stereotypically metal now, so everyone tries to do it. But some riffs should be harmonized, others shouldn't.

I'm a fan of fewer guitar tracks. I went from 4+ to just two, one hard right and one hard left. I think more tracks ""smooths out"" the guitar tone; fewer lets the gritty aggressiveness of a given tone come through, to my ears.

"Explanation of tube amp heads/solid state, cabinetry and effects pedals.","As I get more into guitar playing, I'm piquing interest past my bedroom combo amplifier. After talking with some metal musician friends, I still have some raised questions about amplification and effects pedals. 

I was wondering if anyone would clear up the following...

Guitar Amp Heads

Tube guitar amp head vs. solid state guitar amp heads? 
- (My understanding is as basic as analogue vs. digital sound.)

How does the wattage of the head translate to the guitar cab?

Cabinetry 

What do cabs really do? Do they amplify the output of the already powerful head?

What is the difference between a 1x12 and a 4x12? (Outside the number of speakers)

How many cabs can you connect/is usually connected to a head? What affect does more than one have?
- (This might be dependent on the head)

Why do some musicians have a couple of heads and a couple of cabs on stage? (Matt Pike playing in sleep for instance)

Pedals 

Sometimes the overdrive of the head has enough distortion that I'm looking for but what happens when you add a pedal before entering the head and combining the OD of the head and the effects of the distortion pedal? Is this taste related?

Is it possible to connect into the head, out to a pedal and then back into the cab? What is the achieved effect?


Thanks guys, sorry for the amateur questions but any advice is much appreciated.

"Explanation of tube amp heads/solid state, cabinetry and effects pedals.","Tube/valve and Solid State are very different. A lot of people will say solid state amps sound more ""sterile"" and lack character and warmth in comparison to valve amps. I prefer the sound of valve amps, but a lot of Metal has been recorded using solid state amps. Wattage is more about headroom than volume, although it does have an effect. a 100 watt valve amp will be far more powerful than a 100 watt solid state amp, which is why you see solid state amps with much higher wattages on much smaller amps. A 5 watt amp being put through a 4x12 and being played at a high volume will sound a lot dirtier than than a 50 watt amp being played through a 2x12 at a loud volume. Although the 4x12 cab is able to produce more volume than a 2x12, the 5 watt can't get that loud and stay clean, whilst a 50 watt amp would do a much better job. Using more than 1 cab will just add more volume to the sound, unless you're using the specific cabs for the speakers in them. You'll see bands using multiple amps in their set up because they'll be switching between them for different tones. People put overdrive pedals in front of their amps to push the valves inside of the amp harder, causing them to saturate easier. In Metal, this usually helps tighten up the bottom end of your guitar tone (when done right) and adds a bit more crunch. You don't need to do this, but if your amp isn't quite as aggressive as you'd like it to be, or the bottom end sounds a bit ""flubby"", then this can help. It's not a good idea to connect anything directly between the head and the cab, but some amps have an fx loop which allows you to connect pedals between the preamp valves and power amp valves within the amp. This is usually for things like reverb and delay and other such time based effects. It means that when you change channel on your amp, the tail of the effect won't be messed with and if you're using distortion, you won't be distorting the reverb for example, you'll be adding reverb on top of the already distorted channel. Hope this helps!"
"Explanation of tube amp heads/solid state, cabinetry and effects pedals.","Awesome, very helpful. By ""dirty"" do you mean something along the lines of a lo-fi sound, kind of old school black metal or dirty as in ""muddy"" where notes don't come through and closely tuned strings kind of sound the same? 

In your opinion, what do you think is a common wattage a guitarist might use with a 2x12 or a 4x12 for medium to small size venues/clubs? (Less than 100 people). For metal?

Also, are cab and wattage sizes/combos common amongst certain genres? From what I gather, I'd assume a large sound for doom or death metal might mean large watts, large cab and maybe for black metal small watt head, large out put cab? Or is all of it irrelevant?

Thanks!

"
"Explanation of tube amp heads/solid state, cabinetry and effects pedals.","By dirty, I mean if both of those amps in the example were being played on a clean at a high volume, the lower wattage amp would started to sound more distorted. Well, I use a 50 watt head into a 2x12 cab. This is fine for me in those situations. Although my amp has the ability to alter the wattage from 5 to 50 and I usually play with it set to around 30 watts. There's no right answer for what type of amp to use really, just whatever you find to sound best for what you want."
"Explanation of tube amp heads/solid state, cabinetry and effects pedals.","&gt; Tube guitar amp head vs. solid state guitar amp heads?

Many people think tubes sound better. They have a distinctive sound that solid state can't emulate. But it's mostly a religious issue; some bands don't even use their amp's distortion and few fans would ever notice.

&gt; How does the wattage of the head translate to the guitar cab?

The amp powers the cab. More watts means more potential volume.

&gt; What do cabs really do? Do they amplify the output of the already powerful head?

Cabs contain speakers. Without speakers, the amp makes no sound.

&gt; What is the difference between a 1x12 and a 4x12? (Outside the number of speakers)

More speakers mean more volume. (Because it is physically moving more air.)

&gt; Why do some musicians have a couple of heads and a couple of cabs on stage? 

Usually extra cabs are just for show. Sometimes you might set 2 stacks up for stereo effects though. Occasionally you want 2 different types of sound so you switch between 2 amps. Maybe some people are playing through both at once. Doesn't seem like something 99.9% of people would want or need to do.

&gt; Sometimes the overdrive of the head has enough distortion that I'm looking for but what happens when you add a pedal before entering the head and combining the OD of the head and the effects of the distortion pedal? Is this taste related?

It's common to put a distortion or overdrive pedal before the amp. It's an additive effect and makes things more distorted, as you might expect. Some pedals also have subjectively preferable tone-shaping qualities - eg. the Tube Screamer and similar overdrives will reduce the bottom end somewhat, evening out the tone - so they double up as general tone improvement. It is entirely taste-related.

&gt; Is it possible to connect into the head, out to a pedal and then back into the cab? What is the achieved effect?

Yes, this is common. (EDIT: By which I meant - amp -&gt; pedal -&gt; back to amp -&gt; cab.) Many amps have an effects loop for this purpose. The order in which you apply effects makes a big difference on the sound and explaining all the permutations of effects is too long to go into here. But generally speaking you want to apply most effects after the distortion (ie. in the effects loop) rather than before (ie. before the amp). A simple example would be reverb - you typically want to simulate a distorted guitar in a spacious room, rather than an unamplified guitar in a spacious room and then fed through distortion."
"Explanation of tube amp heads/solid state, cabinetry and effects pedals.","&gt;Tube guitar amp head vs. solid state guitar amp heads? - (My understanding is as basic as analogue vs. digital sound.)

Analogue vs digital is not a terrible way to describe it. Tube amps use old vacuum tube technology, while solid state uses modern circuit board technology. The traditional guitar sound is tube. Guitar distortion was created because of tubes... And for a long time solid state amps just didn't sound like the tubes that created the tones that people loved. And even today most people prefer tubes.

But, solid state amps have really caught up in the last decade or two. There are definitely good sounding solid state amps out there. I've heard recordings of solid state amps that sounded more tube-y than a real tube amp... But there is also many solid state amps that still don't quite sound right. If you decide to go solid state, make sure it's a good one.

The main advantage of tubes is their analogue sound; Very warm and soft, and they have certain subtleties that solid states often don't. Organic.

Solid states stereotypically have advantages in weight, cost, versatility, reliability, and durability. Whether or not this comes at the price of tone depends on the amp and personal opinion.

There are a ton of little differences when it comes to playing and living with tubes and solid state amps.

&gt;How does the wattage of the head translate to the guitar cab?

Usually more wattage means more volume, but it's a diminishing returns deal. Doubling the wattage on the amp will make it much less than twice as loud. There's a lot of factors in volume between the type and size of speakers and the amp/wattage, but more watts usually means more volume. As someone said before, a higher wattage amp can play louder without any distortion than a low wattage amp at the same volume.

Tube amps are louder per watt than solid states, but solid states usually have a higher watt rating to compensate.

Also, the amplifier's wattage shouldn't exceed the amount labeled on the back of the cab. If the wattage running into the cab is too high, you risk blowing speakers if you turn up too loud.

&gt;What do cabs really do? Do they amplify the output of the already powerful head?

A cab is mandatory, because the head does not have any speakers. The cab is specifically a box of speakers to output the signal from the head. No cab means no sound.

Also, tube amps can be damaged if they're run without a cab or equivalent resistance load.

And make sure you use a speaker cable to connect the head and cab. Instrument cables that you use to plug into your guitar are not the same thing.

&gt;What is the difference between a 1x12 and a 4x12? (Outside the number of speakers)

As I mentioned before, wattage is not the only factor in volume. More speakers can push more air, and therefor have higher potential volume... But again, it's not that simple. Adding more speakers may increase the presence of the sound, but not the actual volume. Shit's complex, man.

The size of the speaker cabinet will affect the tone as well. Larger cabinets have more bass frequencies.

But more than one speaker always sounds better to my ears. I say don't go 1x12 unless you're looking for a specifically small rig. Consider 2x12 vs 4x12 instead.

&gt;How many cabs can you connect/is usually connected to a head? What affect does more than one have? - (This might be dependent on the head)

Most heads that I've seen have the ability to run 1 or 2 cabs. If you want to run even more cabs, you're going to need more equipment.

More than one cab means more speakers, which again affects volume and presence (In a not-so-straight forward way).

Increasing the number of cabs can also affect how much power the amp puts out, and how much power goes to each individual speaker... But what that means is going to depend on the set up in question. In most cases it doesn't change much, but I have run into situations in which it did matter.

&gt;Why do some musicians have a couple of heads and a couple of cabs on stage? (Matt Pike playing in sleep for instance)

They may use different amps with different settings for different tones. 

But, as I said above, most amps can only run two cabs. If you want even more volume and more cabs, you're going to need to have more heads to run more cabs.

Some bands have a ton of cabs for aesthetic reasons. Not all cabs may be in use or even functional.

&gt;Sometimes the overdrive of the head has enough distortion that I'm looking for but what happens when you add a pedal before entering the head and combining the OD of the head and the effects of the distortion pedal? Is this taste related?

There is a difference between how tube and solid state amps are affected by distortion/boost pedals. Some pedals are designed for tube amps, they boost the signal to distort the tubes more. Those are boost  or overdrive pedals. Other pedals create their own distortion. 

There could be several reasons to do this, but it generally comes down to what the player likes better.

Perhaps they like the type of distortion the pedal creates, or perhaps they're using the pedal to boost the signal to the tubes, creating a crunch that the amp doesn't do on it's own (Usually done to either create more distortion or affect the bass frequencies of the distortion). Or maybe they don't use pedals because they like the sounds their amp makes.

&gt;Is it possible to connect into the head, out to a pedal and then back into the cab? What is the achieved effect?

Not in the way that you describe it. The output from the head is different than the type that comes from your guitar. You don't plug a pedal between the head and cab.

Guitar -&gt; Head -&gt; Pedal -&gt; Cab

This will not work, and will probably break something.

However, most amps come with an effects loop. There's actually a couple different parts to inside the head. There's a pre-amp, where the tone controls are, and the power amp, which sends the signal to drive the speakers. The effects loop has an send and return sockets on the back of the amp. This creates the signal chain:

Guitar -&gt; Head Pre-amp -&gt; Pedal -&gt; Head Power Amp -&gt; Cab

How that effects the sound is different for every pedal. You'll have to play around to find what you like best. But from what I remember, overdrives and distortions are before the pre-amp. Modulation type effects (Delay, reverb, chorus, phaser, etc) go after. But I don't run many pedals, so I can't really tell you how that works."
"RPM Challenge black metal project - Wyrgan","Evening, comrades in metal.

I was in the [RPM Challenge](http://rpmchallenge.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=844&amp;Itemid=290) this year (which, summed up, is basically to record 35 minutes or 10 songs worth of music only in the month of February) and decided to go in a black metal direction with it. I guess you could say it's progressive black metal, maybe even post-metal. Because I only had a month to do this, some of the ideas are disjointed, I had barely any time to mix, and the lyrics and vocals were done pretty last minute (really). But all in all I really enjoyed the process and almost drove myself nuts writing it.

I'm talking to some local musicians right now to try and make this a real band, but in the meantime, I'd love some constructive feedback on my writing!

"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","So, as i said, i'm about to do some death metal styled vocal recordings / cover stuff, and i need an opinion of someone more experienced to read out my strategy and give me some pointers. 

In a few days i will order a mic and an audio interface, so i still have a few days to think about what i want to get, money is not an issue, but im looking into keeping it around 300-400€. 

For the mic i thought i would go with a classic Shure 58, mainly because i haven't heard a single bad thing about it, and its withing a reasonable price range for amateur usage:

   http://www.thomann.de/gb/shure_sm58_set.htm

For the audio interface i chose Line 6's UX 2, pretty much for the same reasons as the mic:

   http://www.thomann.de/gb/line6_pod_studio_ux2.htm

Now, i plan to record the vocals through the UX 2 to my laptop with USB connection, the program im using to record is called ""Sonar x3"" (any other program you would recommend?), also i will run the whole thing through LIne 6,s build in program ""pod farm"" Does this seem like a working solution?

Also, if i'll move on to doing vocal cover videos (which probably will happen) i was thinking of recording the actual video with my Nikon D3200 camera, muting the audio of that video, adding my vocal track and the actual song on top of the muted video from the camera.
"
"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","Yes, that will work fine. 2 other things:

 1. You'll need to do some work to get it to sound good in a mix. Heavy compression, some EQ, etc. I'm not sure whether you intend layering it over the existing vocal line - if so, maybe you don't really need to worry about how it fits and just make sure it's louder.
 2. If you're doing this at home, you'll need to deaden the room so that the reverberations off the walls aren't audible in the mic. Hanging thick curtains or duvets over hard surfaces helps. Some people like to use something like a [Reflexion Filter](http://www.seelectronics.com/reflexion-filter-pro) attached to the mic stand to help with this, but a recent test in Sound on Sound magazine didn't show that they helped much at all."
"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","Did some googling and the podfarm program should have EQ's and compressions, and for my own music i won't have an existing vocal track, but the covers i will, only slightly muted.

I have the keys for this rehersal room intended for bands to play in, so that should be covered.

Thank you for the answer:)"
"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","I wouldnt necessarily sugget heavy compression right off the bat...compression should be lighter than heavier on vox imo, though i suppose it can depend on the dynamics of the vocal track. Otherwise OP could end up with really loud inhalation noises/nuances that dont lend themselves to the recording"
"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","As a rule, I would just edit those bits out from the recording. If it doesn't sound good loud, you probably don't need it."
"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","Yeah not a bad m.o.. still though, you wouldnt just increase the track volume rather than squash it with a comp? "
"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","For me:

 1. Cut out everything between vocal lines that I don't want;
 2. Automate the level of individual words or phrases up or down if they are significantly too loud or quiet;
 3. Smash it with a compressor to get everything consistent.

I find vocal levels vary too much even within a single phrase for it to be as simple as just setting the track level high enough."
"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","Ah yeah. Certainly nothing wrong with that. To be fair ive never processed metal vocals, haha"
"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","Ah, thank you, i will probably end up copying your strategy ;)"
"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","Vocals are a no-brainer.  You could even get fairly decent vocal tracks just by using a smartphone microphone and a freeware recording program like Audacity.  

Your set up is more than adequate - SM-58s are great and you wont need to upgrade for the forseeable future unless you are really going for an amazing studio setup.

As others said, after the fact you're definitely going to want to add some compression, reverb, and EQ after the fact.  Compression really really helps and will even out the ""final"" volume of the track.  You should also pay attention to the room you are recording in and how it effects reverb and other recording characteristics.  If you have trouble with 'popping' from making hard 'p' and 't' sounds, put a sock over the mic or use a proper pop filter."
"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","Ah and yeah, i have a pop filter added to the buy list too, i'v been thinking about getting the program ""Reaper"" for the compressions and such. Thanks"
"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","Reaper is pretty good.  Good luck and post anything you do up here if you want any feedback."
"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","Thanks :) yeah i will, in a couple of weeks or so..."
"Does my ""strategy"" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.","That's pretty much the configuration I have been using for the last five years when I record at home. You'll be fine.

"Metal Songwriting","so I have been playing guitar for almost 20 years. Long story short without going into extreme detail - despite my ability (Advanced), music theory education (intermediate to advanced) and many many years of trying songwriting is by far my biggest pitfall. 

I just feel like I'm a joke when it comes to making my own music and I have tried a number of different ways to get myself inspired, etc.

I'd love to hear any input you guys all have on your song writing techniques, habits, tips , tricks. ANYTHING!

Also, with all that in mind, has anyone tried this course? I have been considering buying it and if anyone has any experience with this course please chime in!

"Metal Songwriting","My song writing world opened up when I started working on my vocals and playing drums. Once I started understanding and creating more than just guitar parts I could get a more complete song playing in my head before I even picked up an instrument or microphone. even if it's just a kick ass chorus riff and some babbling vocals over the top of it, I use that and built from it until I have a complete song."
"Metal Songwriting","What he said."
"Metal Songwriting","I picked up the drums almost 2 years ago, so not quite good enough to keep my vocals going simultaneously, but the things going thru my head are insane compared to what I used to write with my guitar. This dude nailed it. One? For ya, do you end up writing lyrics that follow your foot patterns? I'm having a hard time breaking this habit for the sake of variety."
"Metal Songwriting","When I was doing a lot of home recording I would deconstruct songs I like; figure out what the changes are, which riff the solo is over, bridge, etc. Some are amazingly complex, and some are amazingly simple.

Then I'd try to write and record a song in the style of a band I liked. ""I want this one to sound like Deftones, LoG,"" etc. "
"Metal Songwriting","'A million miles from nowhere,
Dragon lance burns hot,
By the fire of a horse's ghost a minnow would be lost...
Ch-ch-ch changes... m' tits.
A fish.
A fish with tits...


Tittyfish.'"
"Metal Songwriting","sometimes I feel like the best way to start writing a song is to try and rewrite songs I like by my favourite bands.  I'll start playing a riff, then go with it where I feel the song should go, and then eventually its a whole new song, but the influence can still be heard."
"Metal Songwriting","&gt; rewrite songs I like by my favourite bands.

If you're trying to practice writing lyrics, an even better thing is to translate lyrics from another language."
"Metal Songwriting","Coming from my background in black metal guitar, I find that just picking a random chord and fucking around with its pieces is fun and can provide easy transitions. Also, sus2 chords are fun"
"Metal Songwriting","I did 7 years of music education but before that I played Metal, so I had the self-taught mind. 

I'm 39 and not in bands anymore, but I am writing a riff a week, put the phone or ipad on video, record what i'm playing and then listen. Try it! 

And yes, education is like a tennis net: friend or foe. "
"Metal Songwriting","Songwriting is a whole 'nother discipline compared to music theory, and is more bound to creativity than dilligent discipline and theory.

But try to mimic your idols writing. What would James Hetfield write? What would Eklundh write? What would Misha Mansoor write? 

But just jam around on your guitar, and come up with a riff. Does it sound like a theme? A main riff? A chorus? Then just take it from there!"
"Metal Songwriting","Idk about some of the advice here... I guess different stuff works for different people, but this is what I would recommend.  Start by just trying to write a bunch of riffs - it's ok if they're not even good riffs, because the point here is to just get used to the process of writing original stuff.  Just sit down for a while and play around with different notes/chords on your guitar until you come up with something that you at least kinda like.  It could be something super simple, and again, it doesn't have to be good at this point.  Then write it down.  I have a huge guitar pro file called ""riffs"" that's just tons and tons of rough ideas I've written out, each separated by a few bars of space.  I like guitar pro because I can scroll through and actually listen to all my ideas, but if you don't like using it or you think it takes to long to write stuff out, you can try recording rough takes of your riffs into a simple audio editor (like Audacity) or writing them down on paper.  Just anything that will help you remember and catalog the stuff you've written.  I personally like to try to come up with multiple ideas in the same session, since my brain kind of ""warms up"" and ends up producing better ideas as I go on.  

As you do this more and more, I guarantee you'll start getting the hang of it and end up writing some cool stuff that you like.  Once you have a bunch of ideas, you can start trying to put together a whole song by either trying to connect multiple riffs that you have already, or building off of one that you like and trying to figure out ""what would come next"".  Once you've got a whole song written on guitar you're pretty much set!  Writing drum/bass/whatever parts to go with it is a whole process in itself, but writing the creative core of the song (in your case the guitars) is the most important part."
"Metal Songwriting","I read an interview with Jeff Loomis about his creative process, and it's a lot like this.  He comes up with and records 10 riffs a day every day.  It doesn't matter if half of them are shit, as long as he hits the 10 riff mark.  Then once he has a stockpile, he starts sifting through them and putting them together as a framework and goes from there."
"Metal Songwriting","To add to this, if you're really stuck, finding a random drum beat online and then jamming to it can be helpful."
"Metal Songwriting","If you're like me then it might be easier if you find someone else to bounce ideas off of - especially someone who is better at the foundational aspects of writing - I find that if I have a solid base I can build and elaborate upon that. Getting that base is hard, I want to do everything at once so anything I make seems like it could be something else. With someone elses base you don't have as many of those pesky human psychological urges to change it.

That being said ""just find a partner with very specific counter qualities!"" isn't easy to do - maybe just something you can think about. I know I like to do everything myself but sometimes I have to admit that I can't do it all and I need help (eww! jk)."
"Metal Songwriting","I'm working on something huge that's along the lines

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLufiw_AG5FNENinhQ9Y7tTqmc7G9OP8AH

I'm basically talking about my approach to songwriting which is a bit more detailed than empty ""Play what feels right"" advice. I do everything for a solo project, if you're just looking at guitar, there's a lot less to dig through. But I hope this stuff helps. There's more along the way, I have some stuff coming up on writing leads and solos, followed by lyrics and then finally recording and production as well."
"Metal Songwriting","Very cool! I plan on watching these when I get home tonight. Thank you for sharing"
"Metal Songwriting","I never know if I'm making any sense cause I get into some abstract ideas occasionally, but I hope some of the ideas are clear. The videos on guitar should make more sense since that's my background. Feedback is always nice."
"Metal Songwriting","Something I've found helps me when I hit writer's block and need inspiration is watching bands I like make music. I'll watch docs like Making Magnetic, Crack The Skye: Track By Track, The Making Of The Blackening, etc, and usually it makes me feel like writing. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Obviously creativity can't be forced, but it can be nudged."
"Metal Songwriting","You may be trying to incorporate too much education into the process. Rock out a 3 chord punk thing just to get the juices flowing. Make up 1 line of gibberish lyrics to get the feel of it and BAM shift it into another riff n see if it doesn't help you transition into another naturally flowing section of music just naturally; sometimes it's seamless, like it's a fucking song you already knew. I learned this from Strangers With Candy; 'sometimes when I want to make something original, the first thing I do is get out my tracing paper.' Really, Fuck it, I'm not making money off this song, n it's not direct plagiarism, I ain't hurting nobody, I'm stealing this riff just for fun... Nothing wrong with that either, unless it's done too often or if pros do it"
"Metal Songwriting","Or, write 4 riffs, (or a friend write them, catchy stuff, riffy stuff) then write 3 strange, mathematically sound/technical transitions (which should be your forte) for the in betweens. It's kind of hard to make a cookie cutter for metal song writing, so make your own n fill in the blanks.  "

"Spacey sounding chords and harmonies","I play with a sci-fi themed heavy metal band (clean vocals).  I have always been the primary, but not the only, songwriter for the band.  

I'm curious if anyone out there has some ideas for chord shapes, counterpoints, chord progressions, and/or two part harmony ideas to give a song a distinctive sci-fi sound.  I'm talking stuff that sounds like 50's and 60's sci-fi movie soundtrack.

"Spacey sounding chords and harmonies","You can't go wrong with the diminished scale. Also, coming up with chromatic patterns and tapping them is classic. You can then pick a pattern and ascend/descend one string at a time, or perhaps diagonally. That's the sort of thing Buckethead does. Rings of Saturn also used it a lot on their second album."
"Spacey sounding chords and harmonies","I did a little research and found some other interesting ideas.  I'm adding them here for my own record keeping.

Use major, minor, and lydian scales (augmented IV).
Use tritones.
Use diminshed VI relationships and chords."
"Spacey sounding chords and harmonies","Lydian is your friend. Jumping from the I to the #IV elicits a pretty spacey vibe. "
"Spacey sounding chords and harmonies","Sometimes, less is more! Personally, I find a simple octave (like fret 5 on your A, fret 7 on your G, while muting the D string) creates a great spacey sound. If you've got a chorus pedal, even better!"

"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","Hey guys, So i've been listening to a lot of Black Metal, Ambient, Atmospheric stuff and it really touches me inside, in a way that makes me really want to recreate inspiratiopns and create some of my own stuff. 

Here is a Song that I really love, as an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844FX_9VhX8

However my technical skills are limited and apart from knowing some basic stuff about recording like you're supposed to record the instruments layer per layer and then put them on top of each other to create a song, I don't know much. 

So here it goes: 

If you could throw ANY advice at me, do so. I'm talking Basic recording Hardware, Tools, Software for instruments, recording etc., Tips, Internet Links, Guides, Personal Advice and even general tips on how to really improve my guitar playing."
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","What I learned while writing and recording for my post-metal band:

#1 Expensive equipment will neither improve your guitar playing, nor your mixing skills. Go with the cheap DAWs (reaper?), Audiointerface(Line 6 Guitar Port?), Plugins(Lepou guitaramps),etc. You don't have the knowledge to handle the expensive ones worth their cost, because you don't understand shit. 

#2 Watching every mixing Tutorial there is won't improve your mixing. Mixing is not something you have to know, but to practice. These are some mixing youtube-channels I love:
https://www.youtube.com/user/recordingrevolution
https://www.youtube.com/user/PensadosPlace
https://www.youtube.com/user/MojoJojo378

I used to spend hours watching tutorials on how side-chain compression works but hat no ear to eq a simple bassguitar.
You don't want to hear this, but:

#3 No theoretical input will compensate for the lack of practice and the work to overcome it. You have a fucking long way to go, if you are at the very beginning of it all. 
I record/mix nearly everyday for 3.5 years now and [this](https://soundcloud.com/infold/zach-braff-is-longing-for-love) is the latest mix I uploaded, wich is not more than okay. You may be quicker than I am, but If you want to be world famous tomorrow, bury the dream, because this mindsetting only will get you frustrated ;D

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9KwjQd2XpY&amp;list=PL4oqgoHZcg_KDXKZyEG4QlDs_jNp6oObq) is my post metal band, everything is bedroom recording. Check it out, if you have questions regarding the sounds I used etc., I may be able to answer more specific."
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","I don't wanna offend you, or anyone else, but you seem to be projecting, and quite a lot. I've worked on pro audio for many years. Trust me, an 'okay' mix absolutely doesn't take 3.5 years of practice. Even people who are relatively slow can usually churn out good mixes after a single year of good practice, assuming they're willing to learn. Mastering is different, but the genre OP's interested in doesn't require any serious mastering. If you can't do a professional-sounding mix with proper equipment after 3.5 years of practice, chances are you're either missing the fundamentals or have some really bad habits. The tried and trusted way of fixing this is interning for a studio for a couple of months. 

As for not needing expensive equipment because of not understanding shit, well, exactly what are you supposed to understand about a treated room and a nice pair of monitors before you can benefit from them? Sure, OP won't need a super-expensive analogue multiband compressor, but there certainly is some mid and high end stuff that can make his life easier. Examples would be an audio interface with enough inputs to track a drumkit+room live, or an isolation cabinet for peaceful experimentation with high gain, or a proper keyboard with good sounds that will save him hours of traversing through sample banks and libraries for high-quality sounds that sit well together.

And besides, we're talking about atmospheric black metal, a genre which is easier to mix than pretty much anything else excluding solo instruments. OP can realistically start writing his music and practicing mixing and recording now and end up with an album with the same quality as what he linked in an year, and from his post it seems like that's the goal. You're making it sound like he said he was expecting to fill up a stadium with groupies while Miss America administers heroin up his balls on the stage by the end of the month."
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","I think you are the one projecting, regarding the fact that he, untill now, just expressed his wish to record. From what i got, he is right in the beginning of both guitar and mixing.  Why would he need a 8canal Interface and highend monitors? To sell them when he might be frustrated in a year? Or to track a drumkit he doesn't possess? He is just getting started, so he shouldn't spend a shitload of money on hardware, especialy for a bm production that defines its sound by the poorest recording quality possible. On the other hand, all these delay and reverbclouds are pretty hard to handle in a Mix, and this needs ear and practice. "
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","Saying that he won't need some gear because he might just drop the project is very condescending. OP clearly stated that producing an ambient black metal album is his dream, and asked for advice. There's no room in there for ""yeah, don't buy expensive shit because you'll regret it when you decide to drop the project"".

As for the 8 channel interface, well, most ambient metal projects track their drums live instead of using samples, so I assumed OP was going to do the same. I'll admit there's no need for that if he's doing it with virtual drums, but nowhere did he mention he's gonna do that. As for the monitors, it will save him hours of cross-referencing material between several pairs of headphones and speakers just to check how well his mix transitions, and he'll be able to spend those hours on improving his skills.

Finally, concerning the black metal recording traditions, well, that's just not true. Ambient black metal is notorious for almost being able to mix itself. Leviathan's first album was recorded with on a 4-track tape with vocals and guitars going through very simple analogue signal chains, without any mixing, and the only defect it has is that drums are *slightly* too harsh. Everything else fits perfectly into its atmosphere. Stacked reverb and delay units oftentimes tend to fall well together when the entire thing is distorted, especially when said distortion is on analogue tape. But the gear used for recording was by no means lo-fi: the instruments were all good, the mics were great, and the space was well-treated. The first step was to create an environment in which creating such music was possible. You cannot add those things during mixing. You could try with some very specialized plugins and outboard gear, but those would end up costing much more than just getting good recording conditions from the beginning."
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","You are right,it sounds condescending, but it wasn't ment to. I just wanted to stress one point but couldn't make it clear: Something like ""with great expenses comes great responsibilty"" - I myself was more confident in what I do, when my equipment was in propotion to my skills and i felt like I was in control of all the buttons there are. And maybe that was projection.. Either way, that doesn't really matter in regard of the monitors. When I would start from scratch to play/record, high expenses would put a lot of pressure to me and I would be more occupied to discover some features of gear and software, than to experiment with eq or simple compression. But if that doesn't count for OP, he may well-advised with your recommendation."
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","[Another Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEjOdqZFvhY&amp;feature=youtu.be) about mixing in general"
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","NEEDED: guitar, mic for vocals/etc., good computer, audio interface, DAW, good headphones or speakers for monitors, skill to play accurately with a click, ideas, time.

GOOD BUT OPTIONAL: bass guitar, keyboard, drumkit, studio space, more mics. 

Assuming you have a guitar, computer, and speakers (maybe not that great).  You will need to start putting together a recording setup.  And start recording!  Don't expect your first stuff to be mind-blowing.  Just make music and don't get too hung up on one idea. "

"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","Hey dude,

I liked the song and honestly, it's fantastic. Ambient Black Metal should sound like what you have, in my opinion, because it's raw. It's not supposed to sound over-produced like a lot of stuff lately.

You don't need technical skills either. I wrote an [entire album](http://lordkrehn.bandcamp.com/album/e-volve?from=search&amp;search_item_id=1387195003&amp;search_item_type=a&amp;search_match_part=%3F&amp;search_page_id=13862820&amp;search_rank=2&amp;search_sig=db9c03ad7b1ad0eeb99c05aa604236cd) with shitty skills on guitar and keyboards. Since you're doing black metal, just learn alternative picking and power chords. 

I also recommend looking at guitar tabs for your favorite bands. [Tuxguitar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxguitar/) is free and will allow you to read Guitar Pro tabs, which are honestly the best out there. Just google something like ""Carpathian guitar pro tabs"" and you're set.

/u/paganrae offers good advice, but I think it would help us understand exactly what you want before we could help you. 

[This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaIvzbV40MM&amp;index=27&amp;list=PL69CCCD0075CF5F1F) is decent for EQing drums. Honestly, you just gotta play with everything until you get the sound you like, but this video will give you a start.

My entire setup was relatively simple:

* [Fast-Track Audio interface](http://www.amazon.com/M-Audio-Fast-Track-USB-Interface/dp/B002QZ402Q), but mine is much older
* [AKG D5](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/D5) microphone with pop-filter.
* Behringer Midi controller (keyboard that plugs into a computer)
* BC Rich guitar
* Ibanez Bass guitar (borrowed)
* While I'm a good drummer, I didn't record with my drumset for this album

Then software:

* [Acid Pro](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ACIDPro7), but any software is good 
* [Amplitube 3](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/AmpliTube3e) for guitars, but a variety free ones exist too
* [EZDrummer](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/SupDrum2)
* [Atmosphere VST](http://www.kvraudio.com/product/atmosphere_by_spectrasonics/details)
* [Magnus Choir](http://syntheway.com/choir.htm) for choir
* [Various U-he](http://www.u-he.com/cms/zebra) plugins
* And for mixing I used [Adobe Audition](https://creative.adobe.com/products/audition) because Sony Pro sucks at it


**Song writing:** 

1. While song writing, I work around a riff I really like so I find the tempo of that riff first. 
2. Then in Sony Acid I setup the metronome and record that riff. 
3. I build riffs around that main riff. If I need to change tempo for those parts then I'll mark it in Sony and it will adjust the metronome
4. After all of this, I'll add drum segments (copy/paste with EZDrummer)
5. Then I'll record the entire song in one track
6. Record the entire song in another track (usually lead part here since I write melody first)
7. Rewrite drums with fills, changes, etc. so it's not dull
8. Write keyboard parts
9. Export everything to wav files
10. Import everything to Adobe Audition
11. Add vocals
12. Mix everything and add final touches

I don't know if this helped at all, but I hope it did. The best advice is to just keep doing it. "
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","wow man, thanks! You seem like a really nice dude. Your comment was exactly what I was hoping for. Helps a lot! Glad that you took the time to listen to the song and also like it :)"
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","Hardware:  I do solo recordings with a 4 track recorder.  It allows you to split up all the instrument parts by recording them individually.  The Tascam ones are decent enough.  6 and 8 track is more channels (more parts to layer) and better options but the 4 can get it done.

Tips, etc:  play every day, even when you don't want to.  Make sure you can play any riff at a slow tempo before trying to play it at speed.  This is especially helpful for more challenging parts.  Master it slow, then speed it up bit by bit.

General guitar playing tips:  Again, play every day.  Play with other musicians every chance you get.  Learn to play things you hear without having to refer to tabs or whatnot.  Don't limit yourself to learning only metal, inspiration can come from anywhere.  Inspiration doesn't even have to come from music or theory at all (very little of mine does actually)  Guitar is a skill set that has no ceiling, something you can never stop improving at.  And the only serious way to improve is to put in the hours every day."
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","thank you for the advice. I have a question, you mentioned learning by hearing and not referring to tabs etc, how do i start with that? i mean i have a good ear for instruments and music i'd say but i don't know how to transfer this onto my fretboard :("
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","There is probably a more scholarly method but this is how I started to do this.

Take it one note at a time.  Take a guess at where that 1st note might be on the fret board.  Keep guessing until you find the right one (this gets easier very quickly the more you practice).  Rewind the song or riff or part 20 times if you have to.  Usually the following notes will be nearby.  

If you can sing or hum then hum the note right when you hear it and match the pitch.  Then keep humming while you try to place the note on the fret board.

Write down each note as you find it in whatever notation works for you (tab is fine) this is so you don't forget it while you progress further."
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","can you really be a musician without knowing ""proper"" notes? "
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","If you can express your emotions through an instrument then you are a musician.  Regardless of how you got to that point.

But on the topic of theory.  Learning scales and chords helps you piece together songs very quickly.  When you are guessing what notes are being played you can take more accurate guesses within the scale you hear the music being played in."
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","I understand. Any advice on learning scales and chords? Most google search results are monetized links which dont get you anywhere I think"
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","[deleted]"
"Looking for Advice on how to get closer to my dream of recording my own Ambient Black Metal music.","It's gonna be tough because you need to be good at writing for a bunch of different instruments (guitars, synths, vocals, drums), and you have to play or program them all in, and you need the hardware and software to do it with. Then you need the skill to mix it all. So you should expect to set aside a lot of time, and dedicate much of that to learning and experimentation.

It would take forever to explain every aspect of it, so probably the best thing for you is to get a DAW (as mentioned by other commenters), work out the best way of getting your guitar recorded (direct input + software amp vs hardware amp + microphone, for example), pick a way to program drums (EZDrummer is a good starting point), and just get started. Come back when you have specific questions.

First of all, invest in a DAW. It can be a cheap one (like Reaper) or a more expensive one (like Pro Tools). You will just have to try out the free trials on different programs to find which ones you like best. I am currently using Logic because it comes with a TON of MIDI libraries, and I don't have any better drum sounds yet.

Next, you need some method to record. I use a Line 6 POD X3, and I absolutely love it. It has dozens, if not hundreds, of built in amps, as well as several vocal effects. It is also completely digital, meaning you do not need a mic for the guitars. You can just connect it directly to your computer to record.

For vocals, anything will do really if you have a quiet space you can record in.

As for mixing, the best teacher is experience. You will learn much more by playing with it than watching tutorials. There are a few things to keep in mind though. This type of metal often has many layered guitar tracks to create that cloudy texture. I use four guitar tracks: one panned all the way left, one all the way right, one slightly left, and one slightly right. And vocals, don't mix them too loud. They are typically behind the mix with some reverb to create a distant sound, rather than in your face."

You can have your gain cranked and play the crunchiest chord and still hear every note.

"Good EQ bandwidth areas for specific instruments (Prog Metal/Power Metal/Symphony elements too..?)","I'm wanting to really buckle down and finally start recording some stuff after some years of not really touching my equipment (busy work life and personal life for awhile now).

I've never really taken note of specific ways I would EQ my mixes in the past so I'm trying to go into this again with a clean slate before I take any bad habits with me into mixing/recording.  

I'll be playing through an Eleven Rack for Guitar and Bass, using a DM10 Alesis drum kit with Addictive Drums sounds, and some Omnisphere and Eastwest Quantum Leap VSTs on midi controller/keys for some symphonic elements.

I read up a few days ago on an old thread by [Ensi](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalmusicians/comments/u05ae/ensis_very_basic_guide_to_metal_recording_and/) which seems like its going to be extremely helpful (as I used to always do the cheap/lazy way of double tracking guitars with a hard pan left/hard pan right copy/paste off set..and as he shows its a shit method compared to actually double tracking).  

Does anyone know some generally successful EQ # ranges/bandwidths to keep within with specific instruments and general areas to pan them to in the mix before I really get neck deep into it today?  

For example on drums, is it common to keep the snare off-center or dead center?  Toms and cymbals I'm sure are something you just kind of play with in the mix though so I'll goof off with them.

I've never recorded any midi elements yet in any mix I've done.  I'm wondering about what EQ range to keep them in as well.  Should I keep them very mid-heavy with the guitars or will it muddy up the mix?  Should they pan out hard left and right as well to envelope the drums and bass?  

Any tips or tried and true methods from anyone would be appreciated!"
"Good EQ bandwidth areas for specific instruments (Prog Metal/Power Metal/Symphony elements too..?)","As a musician and mixer that does primarily hard rock and metal, and genuinely love power metal--and I record in a similar way to how you've described (i.e., I use a PODXT for guitar and bass, ADD drums and others, etc...)  Here's my $0.02...

I high pass the guitars around 70-90 Hz.  Bearing in mind I use really thick strings that aren't lacking for low-end, so I can go up to around 120 before they start sounding thin.  I roll off that low end so the guitars don't step all over the kick and bass.  After than I usually eliminate some of the super fizzy high end (I do use impulse responses which help, but there's always some highs that want to stab me in the ear) usually focusing on the 8kHz+, depending on the results, I'll either notch it out with a wide Q, do a shelf, or just a low pass; it depends.  After that, I may slap a multiband compressor on a guitar subgroup to mellow stuff out, but that's about it.

For drums, I don't really do all that much, honestly.  Addictive Drums (and Steven Slate as well) come out of the box pretty well sampled and sound great.  A lot of EQ choices I make will depend on the other instruments and what effect I'm going for.  Usually, though, if it's matter of the kick not hitting hard enough or getting masked, I'll find the frequencies in the other instruemnts in question and pull those down.  Most of the time with drums I'm working on the high end and presence, making the cymbals audible and clear without having any harshness that'll take someone's head off.

With bass, I tend to sidechain some compression to the kick so they're not in the way of each other, and I'll usually EQ out some mids (between the low mids and the high mids).  Occassionally I'll low pass if the high end on the bass is interfering with anything else.

I treat Keys and synths very similarly to guitars.  I hi pass up to where I feel comfortable and then work on eliminating any conflicting frequencies.

In terms of panning (which I haven't mentioned) I do LCR: guitars, keys, effects returns, overheads and room mics, cymbals, toms, all panned hard left and hard right; kick, snare, vocals, bass, solos, etc all up the middle.

The biggest thing, I feel, with mixing is deciding what element(s) are the most important at any given point in the song. Not everything can be up front, some things can hang back, some can be little ear ticklers, while at other times other things have to be front and center for the effect you're wanting the song/section/whatever to have.  I've found that if I can decide those things and focus on achieving those, the individual micro decisions come a lot easier with a lot less stress.

Hope this helps"

* Vocals are too loud. Maybe wetten them a bit more?
* You almost can't hear the guitars, need to bring em up a bit.
* Kick also needs to come up.
* Actually, just get the vocals down and I think the levels will be alright.
* Pan out the cymbals.
* Guitar-sound I think is pretty cool.

"Looking for feedback on a song we covered.","Great song to cover. One thing is that Andrew's vocal style is very percussive, so any time you don't hit the exact cadence as the original track it comes out a bit sloppy. I actually thought the more metal drumming was pretty clever, could take that concept further with this track. Good stuff!"
"Looking for feedback on a song we covered.","When my brother and I decided to cover Spy Hunter, our biggest concern was that Andrew's voice is really unique and hard to cover and I definitely had issues hitting all his parts correctly.

Thanks for enjoying the drums though, it's the first track I put together on this program and I'm glad it sounded ok."
"Recording your own music, what does YOUR setup look like?","For years I have been recording crudely, slapped together pieces with a very rudimentary setup. Needless to say, there is a lot that can be improved even for a home recording. 

Currently I am using:

Apex 435 Wide Diaphragm Studio Microphone

this is the mic for my Line 6 spider valve 212 bogner tube amp, currently no noisegate or added pedals. (tone isn't great)

this all goes through my Tascam US-122L USB 2.0 digital interface

As far as software, Reaper is an easy click and record program, sometimes this is imported to Adobe Audition 3.0. The effects interface on this program blows. I don't own a copy of pro tools sadly.

Fruity loops for drum tracks. The hits from the drum kit from hell used with EZdrummer most frequently, can be used in this program though there are much better sounding alternatives.

Lately (harsh) vocals are slowly making their debut into the tracks.

That's pretty much it, I'd like to know what other people use because I'm at a point where learning new techniques or software would make the best of what I can record.

It's a bit embarrassing to tell other metal musicians about my setup, I do the best with what I've got and I'm hopeful some of you can help with suggesting equipment, software or anything from your experience.

Thanks in advance."
"Recording your own music, what does YOUR setup look like?","You can get great results with what you've currently got as long as you do it right. Don't be embarassed. People seem to think more/better/more expensive gear = better sound (and in some cases that's true), but you can do a ton of good shit with very little in this day and age. And why not just pop EZDrummer into Reaper instead of doing it in FL?

**My setup:**

* Line 6 Toneport UX1 interface (supercheap and old)
* EVH 5153 50w (I mostly use ampsims though, easier)
* Shure SM57 for amp/vocals
* REAPER for recording/mixing (it's great)
* Steven Slate for drums

[Here's an original song I recorded](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTJbkG3I27E)

"Recording your own music, what does YOUR setup look like?","This song sounds amazing, I can't believe this was done with reaper. Honestly, I didn't know you could pop EZdrummer into reaper. I should learn more about this program, and amp simulators. 

I've heard a lot of good things about the Shure SM57 recently. I'll look into this, thanks so much. This blew my mind!"
"Recording your own music, what does YOUR setup look like?","Haha! Yes, just get an SM57 right now. It's just one of those mics ***EVERYONE*** seems to have at least 1 of. Get a pop-filter while you're at it if you don't already have one.

Yeah you can add EZD in to Reaper as a VSTi plugin.

For ampsims I recommend the LePou amps. LePou also makes a good cab-simulator (aka Impulse Loader) called LeCab2. For impulses themselves (""cabs"") go download the GuitarHacks Impulse pack.

^ All of that = free

You can also look into the TSE (The Serina Experiment) stuff. They have a great tubescreamer vst and also a really good Bass DI vst based off the Sansamp Bass Driver.
"
"Recording your own music, what does YOUR setup look like?","I must be doing something completely wrong, because I have everyone of those same ampsim plugins, Le Pou etc., and it gives me the worst sounding distortion I've ever heard.

"Recording your own music, what does YOUR setup look like?","I have the most ghetto set-up ever. For my guitar amp I'm using a Fender Mustang II, and that's being recorded by a cheap Logitech USB mic. I'm using garageband as my software, as a result the majority of my time recording is spent fucking with different effects on the drums to make them not sound so weird. My guitars are a Squire Stratocaster and an Ibanez that I haven't been able to identify. I also have a fender p-bass and ibanez bass amp, but I usually don't record bass just because my mic can't handle the lows. Vocals (harsh and clean) are also recorded on the Logitech."

"Recording your own music, what does YOUR setup look like?","My band recorded our demo with a drum machine because we lost our drummer, garageband amp plugins for the guitar and bass amps, and the computer mike for the vocals. A vocal mike with a plosive screen is high on our priorities."
"Recording your own music, what does YOUR setup look like?","Sound engineers didn't have these screens in the past. The best thing to do is put the mic 45 degrees off-axis with the vocalist and make sure the vocalist steps back as far as it takes to not record breathing. You can see Peter Steele and even Freddie Mercury doing that crap on nearly all live performances especially because it looks like Peter liked using SM57's (or similar) as main mic a lot of the time. It still works and it's free."

"EQ tips for an 8 string with EMG pickups?","I've had a Schecter Damien 8 for a couple years now and even though it's a great guitar to play, I've never been able to record anything I've written on it with good results because no matter how hard I try I can't get it to sound good. Some of my favorite guitarists use EMGs, so I know the answer's not as simple as shitty pickups, but I don't know what to do to get a good tone out of it. Any advice?

EDIT: The pickups are the stock EMG 808s that came with it and for now I'm running everything through Pod Farm. My living situation is not optimal for recording with an amplifier."
"EQ tips for an 8 string with EMG pickups?","808's are notoriously hard to get a good sound out of. If you can, replace them with X-series EMGs or Blackouts.

I would recommend adding a EQ to your recorded tones, and messing with it to see what frequencies sound good which dont. you can do this by setting a EQ with a high Q / negative gain, and move it around the freq range till your tone sounds better. chances are there are ""dead spots"" in your tone.

Also, what guage/type of string are you using for the lowest note? too light of a string is a common problem.

This thread is a pretty good info dump: http://www.sevenstring.org/forum/gear-equipment/259160-general-8-string-eq-tips.html"
"EQ tips for an 8 string with EMG pickups?","I have a similar setup. Custom 8 string built by a luthier friend with 808s. Pod x3. I get decent tones out of my x3. I have a friend that used to use farm and he recently got a pod hd, and he says the hd sounds way better. Maybe that's your problem. And just as a general rule, you need way less gain than you think."
"EQ tips for an 8 string with EMG pickups?","I don't own an 8 string but I suspect that it is a combination of really low notes and not thick enough strings, perhaps?

I think the thickest open string (whatever it is) on an 8-string sounds like poop with 90% of players."
"EQ tips for an 8 string with EMG pickups?","Less gain, less bass, more mids. Less strings even :)"

"Question about guitar value (xpost from Gear4Sale)","Hi all, I'm looking to sell a rare 90th Anniversary John Petrucci Ibanez that's signed by John Petrucci himself. I'm curious as to how these kinds of guitars (in these kinds of genres) increase in their general appraisal as collectors items, or if they typically don't move one way or the other beyond the common asking prices (in light of the signature).
Thanks very much for info!"
"Question about guitar value (xpost from Gear4Sale)","Not sure how much you paid for it but the JP Ibanez tends to shift for around the $2,000-2,500 region. That is the JP2. 

I'm guessing you have the JPM90HAM with the ""unstandard"" colour finish?

Is it actually signed by him or does it just have his signature on the back of the headstock which comes as standard on them?

Not sure how much value the signature will add. Maybe around $500 at most, bring you up to $3,000.

"Rough demo of a new song. Feedback? Melodic metal heavily inspired by early Gothenburg melodic death metal.","https://soundcloud.com/marshdwellerohio/the-northern-shore

Here's a demo of a song from a solo album I have.  This is just guitars and a drum machine, but there will be bass, vocals (screamed and clean), and some auxiliary instruments.

Are the riffs themselves strong? Does the structure make sense? Keep in mind that this has not been mixed/mastered *at all*.  This is straight as I recorded it. Thanks for listening!"
"Rough demo of a new song. Feedback? Melodic metal heavily inspired by early Gothenburg melodic death metal.","I would turn up the main riff a good bit louder for the guitars. They don't pump enough. The structure is very cool and does make sense to me.  This track kinda has a Tool vibe and I like it.  I would suggest maybe going double time with the guitars to follow the drums around 2:22 or at least change your strum pattern a bit to give the song a different dimension through there. The song could definitely use some low end but I enjoy the guitars quite a bit. Cool track dude."
"Rough demo of a new song. Feedback? Melodic metal heavily inspired by early Gothenburg melodic death metal.","I very much enjoyed it.  It has a lot of potential to be really cool whenever you get around to adding bass and vocals to it.  I'm interested to hear the final product.  Keep it up!"
"floyd-rose intonation/maintenance etc.","so i have never had a guitar with a floyd-rose system on it before, but moreover i have never fully optimized any of my guitars for what i end up specifically doing with it (because there is a guitar for every occasion, right?!). 

now i have a nice little strat-style electric than i'm basically outfitting for death, thrash, and black metals, and it has a floyd-rose. i hear that pretty well anything you do to a guitar is going to affect the intonation, and i have done a fair bit to contribute to that on mine, including:
* replacing stock tuning heads with grover mini-roto's
* replaced both stock humbuckers
* use heavier-gauge strings (usually 11-52)
* tune to C#/drop B

i got the guitar secondhand, so no idea if anything was done to the bridge before i got it; i'm sure it's not dialed in for my specific purposes.

tl/dr: how important do you consider a properly intonated bridge is, and do you have any tips or resources?"
"floyd-rose intonation/maintenance etc.","A properly intonated bridge is absolutely essential. Setting up a Floyd can take a while especially if you're new. I won't go through the entire process but quickly:

The bridge floats which means a balance between string tension and spring tension (springs accessible under the cover plate on the back of the guitar) must match. The way to tell if they match is by ensuring the bridge floats parallel to the surface of your guitar body. If the bridge rides low or pulls up, you're doing it wrong. Additional springs can be purchased if more tension at the bridge is required. I recall having 5 springs in my Floyd when I had it.

When you restring, you want to set the adjustment for the saddles on each string to half-way. That way, if/when you need to adjust intonation on the strings, you have equal room for adjustment in both directions.

When you re-string, stretch your strings extensively so there is no stretching ""slack"" left in them. If you fail to do this, then tighten up all the blocks at the nut, the strings will continuously go out of tune as you play and especially when you bend. This will then require loosening all the nut bolts, re-tuning, which is a pain in the ass because...

Since the bridge floats, any change in overall string tension, for any reason, will directly affect the bridge. Strings that aren't stretched out before nut bolts are tightened will stretch afterward and the overall string tension will drop, and the bridge will sink because it's now pulling too hard. Tuning up after re-stringing can be a pain, because you pretty much have to cycle through all the strings 4-5 times, then stretch them all out, then cycle through them all again 3-4 times, then stretch them all again, then cycle through again 3-4 times and just keep doing this over and over and over again until stretching has zero effect on tuning. You will likely have to adjust the bridge slightly while you do this as well, to keep it parallel with the body, which ensures proper intonation is even possible.

When you adjust the bridge tighter (by tightening the screws inside the body/bridge cavity) it will *pull* the strings tighter and raise the entire guitar's tuning up a bit. That means you have to down-tune a little bit again! Of course, when you do this, the bridge again pulls harder and drops down because the overall string tension just dropped when you tuned it down a bit. So now you have to fucking loosen the screws a little bit so the bridge comes parallel again. But now the strings are going sharp again because the bridge just eased up a bit... you can see where this is going, right?

One rule of thumb I used to always follow is this: Take it in small steps and always take into account the equal and opposite reaction that will occur at the other end when you are adjusting the strings or springs. 

It seems like a lot but it's really quite simple. It's just a balancing act. The bridge is a fulcrum with two things yanking at it from either side. Equalize them, and get the side with strings on it to also be in tune and well-stretched out so there is no slack in them. After that, tighten it all up and you can literally do anything to that guitar and it will *never* come out of tune.

Finally -- when you re-string and are tightening the small little bridge-blocks onto the string, don't over-tighten. These blocks can and will crack and fail if you go nuts. Just make it tight, don't kill it."
"floyd-rose intonation/maintenance etc.","thanks! great response.

yes i can see i have a lot of work to do, haha. 

best way to stretch out the strings?"
"floyd-rose intonation/maintenance etc.","Grab them and pull really hard on them. Think 2-3 whole step bend, kind of thing. Or harder. Just don't break it, eh?"
"floyd-rose intonation/maintenance etc.","haha cheers"
"floyd-rose intonation/maintenance etc.","In addition to this, to get yourself close: 

- back off your springs drastically so there's basically no tension

- put one string in, tighten a little so that the bridge is a little above parallel

- insert the number of pennies in the cavity between the bridge block and the back side of the cavity to bring the just about parallel (I use electrical tape to keep the pennies together)

- string up the guitar completely to tension

- screw in the spring harness until the pennies just slip

Now your bridge tension should be set up properly, but if your intonation is off too, I would suggest looking into a tool called the key from Stew-mac that holds onto your string block so you can micro adjust the position for intonation.

Good luck."

"Question about squealies","I have been trying to get squealies that sound like [this](http://youtu.be/9Nt0Cat5RO8)(0:04). But everytime I do a squealie, it sounds like I'm just bending the string in a higher note (it's hard to explain). Do I need to have my amp knobs on certain positions? Is this a crybaby/whammy pedal effect? Or am I just not doing squealies right?"
"Question about squealies","That is a pinch harmonic, also called a false harmonic.  You're activating a harmonic node along with the original pitch being fretted, same as touching the string lightly at the twelfth fret.    The guy who explained it to me basically told me to ""stop playing like a pussy - dig in"".  What he meant was the need to pick deeper into the string and catch a bit of it with the flesh of the topside of your thumb between where you grip the pick and your thumbnail.  Envision it as a little shovel,  digging out a tiny hole-that visual seems to help some of my students who are having issues with it.  They may also be juicing it with a wah or whammy. It's certainly mixed  so that it's prominent,  but you can get them to speak loud in performance without them.  To my ears, it doesn't sound particularly wha or whammy-ish.  At the end of the day, focus on your timing of brushing the string with your thumb immediately after the pick hits. Keep at it - good luck! "
"Question about squealies","Thank you for the help!"
"Question about squealies","No problem!"
"Question about squealies","If I asked my guitarist to ""make a squealie"" he'd probably fart."
"Question about squealies","A number of things can make pinch harmonics easier like overdrive, hot pickups, etc.. however ultimately your technique is going to be critical.

The metal soloist commonly grips the pick with only a small amount of the pick's tip protruding from the edge of his thumb.

You'll find its more of a wrist rotation than anything else, where the edge of your thumb brushes the string after pick contact.

I've found 7th fret on the G string (and really the G string in general) is very responsive to pinch harmonics, so that may be a good place to practice. 

YouTube probably has a metric butt-load of videos that can illustrate this.

Good luck on your journey to metal mastery."
"Question about squealies","Sounds like you have step 1 down which is making the actual harmonic. If you don't then you just need to choke way up on a small thick pick and find the right place to hit the string to get a clear pinch harmonic going. Then to get that ""squealy"" sound (lol by the way) you need to get a super fast super exaggerated vibrato (bending and releasing string quickly) going on. Tuning down or using lighter strings helps with this part. No Whammy effects or anything, it's all just high gain and vibrato on a pinch harmonic."
"Question about squealies","You need super wanky vibrato to make them pop like that."

UPDATE 1: fixed the solos and some off-sync rhythm parts. Link is the same."
"Our first legitimate track: Transcend Humanity! Comments and feedback are appreciated. [x-post from r/metal]","I can hear the click of the kick, but the bass lacks presence. If you haven't already, try sending the bass to a second track and put on a R.A.T. distortion or a guitar amp or something. The kick click also sounds too ""airy""- if you boosted the upper range somewhere, try shifting the frequency and finding something more palatable, probably higher up in the register. Make sure you cut other instruments in that area to carve out a spot for it.

The guitar tone sounds great, but they're played somewhat sloppily; make sure you've reduced latency as much as possible and always record to the drum track, and then listen to each track individually with the drums and do some editing if need be.

The vocals need work. Sounds like you used quite a bit of distortion and reverb. I would reduce the amount of distortion and the wet-dry mix of the distortion to around 15-35%- it just needs to be a hair. Then turn the reverb room size and wet-dry mix down so it gives the vocals some air. You shouldn't really be able to hear the actual reverb reflections in the mix itself when all of the instruments are playing. :)"
"Our first legitimate track: Transcend Humanity! Comments and feedback are appreciated. [x-post from r/metal]","Thanks!

1. There is actually a 2nd bass guitar track with added distortion, but the reason it ""lacks presence"" is because the double-tracked bass was a bit too loud in the mix, so I turned it down a little. 

2. I see. Tell me where you feel our playing got sloppy and I'll go back and rerecord it.

3. The problem with the vocals was that while I did the whole song in Reaper, my friend (Hersh) was using Garageband to do the vocals because he did them separately at his house. But I'll ask him to send the raw MP3 file without reverb.

Either way, thanks for the advice. "

"Hey r/MetalMusicians, free promo for metal bands, Soundclouds needed!","Hey r/MetalMusicians, I'm beta-testing a new site called Fanum where independent artists can post their music, and fans do the promoting by using one of their 3 per month ""headphones"" to favorite/support the artist. Currently, there's absolutely no metal section. There are less than 300 artists signed on so far, and as a life-long fan of metal, I'd love if I could recommend some of you guys to the beta test using your Soundclouds. Even if this website does not take off, what do you have to lose? Thanks!

Here's the description for the artists' section from the website: 
""On fanum.fm, artists can spend more time making music and less time seeking out ways to market and promote it. We've gathered music's biggest fans all in one place, a place where they are constantly and actively searching for new talent. Fanum.fm is more than just another outlet for promotion. It takes the mystery and the luck out of ""being discovered"" and gives you the best shot at making it big and sharing your sound."""

"Vocal stomp boxes - trying to thicken up my sound","I've found in the past that I run into issues with my vocal style for screaming/growling vocals. Most often this manifests itself as screams/growls that come out quiet and require a lot of use of the gain knob. Trying to use this method, however, often results in clean vocals that come out with lots of distortion and/or feedback. I've been looking into getting a vocal stomp box so that i can switch back and forth between high gain/low gain inputs. This would be a be a lot easier if I could use a guitar stomp box but I think I'll run into issues with the low z input mics produce.

Keep in mind that I'm hoping to use this mostly for live performances so I'll most often be using an SM58 dynamic mic. Has anyone here tried using any vocal stomp boxes with gain controls or maybe compression controls?"
"Vocal stomp boxes - trying to thicken up my sound","Guitar pedals would compress the signal a bit oddly for vocals, and you'd end up with a vaguely telephone-ish quality to your voice. 

The ideal solution would be to work on your technique, whether it be more diaphragm support or microphone control."

"What is the best software for creating thrash metal music and backing tracks and such?","Grab a DAW of some kind, I like Reaper personally. You'll also need a drum plugin, try superior drummer, ez drummer or addictive drums. From there you can get killer tones with amp sim, try TSE audio for preamp and Poulin lecab for an impulse loader. From there its just setting it up and tracking stuff. Have fun dude! "

I really dig the music, but to be perfectly honest, the mixing and the mastering sound quite bad... I don't know how it came to happen, maybe the budget was tight, maybe the mixing engineer is still learning, whatever the reason is, I've probably been there, and I understand it, but it doesn't change the fact that right now, your sound is gonna be your first obstacle (imo). Like I said before I dig the music, you guys seem pretty tight (although, I think parts of your song might benefit from a little bit of editing), there's no reason you shouldn't sound way more massive than that.

"[Melodic Deathcore/Death Metal] I'm fulfilling a personal dream of mine and putting out an album soon. Here's a track from it.","Want an honest opinion man? The mixing is poorly put together. The vocals completely overpower everything else. I could barely hear the guitars, bass, and drums unless I really cranked up the volume. It reminds me a lot of Job For A Cowboy in their Genesis and Doom era (not a bad thing, but not sure if that was what you wanted to go for). You guys definitely have a lot of potential but seriously consider working on the mixing and production, especially in the vocal region. Boost up the volume on the music or lower the vocals and you guys may have something going. Hopefully you guys can make a sound for yourself and make something happen!"

"What hardware does your band use to record writing sessions?","If you want a quick and dirty (and free) way to record, there are a multitude of phone apps you can use.  I use an app called iTalk, and it's fine provided it's not too close to your setup.  "
"What hardware does your band use to record writing sessions?","Yeah, we always just wrap a phone in a t-shirt and put it behind the drummer (amps are all facing him).

"What hardware does your band use to record writing sessions?","I bought a Samson Go Mic for myself so I could record ideas at school. It's $40 new and it's a pretty good microphone for the price (and the size, it's quite tiny). It has the option to run as a cardioid mic, a cardioid with -10dB, and one that captures all sides (I forget what that's called). It's also a USB microphone so all you'll need is a laptop and something like Audacity and you'll be hooked up and rolling right away.

"What hardware does your band use to record writing sessions?","Hmm seems nice. You said you use it to record guitar ideas, but have you ever used it to capture a whole band?"
"What hardware does your band use to record writing sessions?","Sadly, no. I haven't been in a band in a couple of years so I couldn't tell you whether it picks up a whole band. However, it picks up my drums pretty well, and I pound my drums when I play them. I think if you positioned your equipment towards the mic and used the -10dB it could handle it (you could also further lower the sensitivity of the mic through your computer's sound settings). 

But like I said though, I haven't been able to try it in a band setting, so that's all theoretical. I strongly recommend it though because you will get use out of it even if it doesn't hold up in a band setting. It comes in handy and it's so convenient to have a good mic that's able to connect via USB."

"Vocalist needed.","You're going about this completely ass-backwards in my opinion.  Vocals come after the music is written.  Sometimes the riff can set a certain mood and inspire some lyrics.  Also, having the riff/beat down already will allow the vocalist to know how to fit the vocals over the music rhythmically.  Try writing/recording the song and putting a demo up here so someone can have an idea of what to do with it."

[The soloist](http://www.jacksonguitars.com/en-AU/guitars/soloist/models/usa-sl2ht-soloist-ebony-fretboard-black/) with the string through body has a certain drool factor for me.  I have however been a convert of Gibson the last few years after picking up a flying V for cheap because it had a mild paint scratch on it (no one would touch it because of a mild imperfection).  It's well balanced, stays in tune even with my heavy handed picking style and sounds great even with just the stock pickups in it."

Hoping it sounds good!","You might want to work on your tone, i new what you were running because I did the same thing, clean channel with a distortion type deal, the problem is the chugs are flubby, and higher notes are squeeky. Try using whatever amp sim you are using with the gain at only around three on the crunch channel and mids at like 5 (unmetal  i know) and just use a tubescreamer to crank the gain without using clarity. I always thiught the secret to a metal tone was mids at 2, clean channel, and a fullbore metal pedal, when i just used a peavey 6505 clone with a tubescreamer I was blown away at how good it sounded.

"Metal vocals?","I'm a guitarist, which is my primary instrument. I like vocals too. 

I can do death metal vocals, but it's *hit or miss*, being that I can either do them (death growls), or it just comes out not how I planned.. 

Does anyone have any help on getting a deep, gutteral (is that the right word? It sounds right..) sound. A bit like [Vincent Scheerman from Dissect](http://youtu.be/JOikPv8ev-Q?t=1m38s), [George Fisher from Cannibal Corpse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4n5LiAxqhM) and [Glen Benton from Deicide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSkc-ZISYQM)

I know a few things, like 'don't do it from your throat', and something about your abdomen.. 

Also, if anyone had any help with thrash metal vocals.. That would be cool and appreciated too. "
"Metal vocals?","Honey, Humidifier, Practice.
"
"Metal vocals?","It also depends on your voice. Find out what sounds your voice CAN do. Some people can't do gutterals. Like I have a good deep growl and midrange...but can get iffy in high range and I can't pull off good thrash(like slayer type shouts). If you can manage it cool, but dont blow your voice trying.

(I pulled off some crazy grindcore shrieks while drunk at a house show...ended up losing my voice for a few days, haha)"
"Metal vocals?","My lows are good (not spot on, but decent). Highs not so good. I've recently got into a band called Avatar. I've tried to do those vocals, but can't. Sadly. 

Grindcore just baffles me. I'd love to do those haha!"
"Metal vocals?","the ""something about your abdomen"" is to use your diaphragm. this will make such a difference. ive heard so many ""screamers"" that dont do this and they sound like shit and cant even talk after they play a set."
"Metal vocals?","IF SOME DICK THINKS THE ZEN OF SCREAMING IS 'WANK' DONT LISTEN TO THE TOSSER CUNT CUZ HE DOESNT KNO WTF HES TALKING ABOUT. Melissa Cross is DOPE - dont listen to ANYONE else on youtube. Anyway this shit takes WAY more practice than singing, dont think youre going to do heavy vocals as an easy way to contribute to the music. just like everything else in metal its fuckin hard to control the overtones and produce something really thick and hollow from you gutural region.  Vocal Exercises &amp; proper warm ups 10x more than practicing along with a track.  work your lows until they are AWESOME before working on your vocal fry technique.  really be able to control your pitch thru muscle control first, this will let you know youre ready to work on the part that can REALLY FUCK YOUR VOCALS IF U DO IT WRONG.  As opposed to singing, where I feel compression on my diaphragm from the top, with heavy vocals, i feel the compression from the bottom of my diaphram.  ""HISSSSSS"" &amp; really clench your PC muscle FUCKIN HARD(yeah, the one that controls your dick). thats the region where we will be producing our power.  the rest is refining technique.  WARMUP WARMUP WARMUP -  PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE - AND MOST IMPORTANT - REST!"

"Metal vocals?","Thanks dude! Hoping to be recording our full length by the end of summer to early fall. "
"Metal vocals?","Drink milk. Flex your abs."
"Metal vocals?","The best advice I have for you is to warm up properly, practice daily, drink plenty of water, and try to avoid performing vocals in a dry enviornment. Daily practice will get you the consistency you desire.
 Melissa Cross is a great source for. learning the basic technique, past that it is up to you to discover how to generate the tone you want. For a Corpsegrinder type of vocal it's all about breath power and diaphragm strength. "
"Metal vocals?","Look on YouTube for singing videos by Robert Luciani. He has some really solid advice. Also look up Vocal Fry. Avoid the Zen of Screaming. It is total wank."
"Metal vocals?","The Zen of Screaming is *not* total wank, it just doesn't teach screaming, it teaches things like breath control and tongue placement. It helped me a lot when I was learning.

I hear volume two does teach it, but I've only seen volume one."
"Metal vocals?","It felt like total wank when I was watching it. The second DVD is better, but it is no way a great DVD to learn from. It constantly felt like an advertisement for Melissa's school rather than a teaching guide. I wouldn't ever recommend it, especially when you can find more efficient, succinct teaching online. The first DVD is all stuff you can find from any singing resource. 

I'm not going to sit here and argue it more, but it's really not the first thing I'd ever recommend when it comes to learning any kind of harsh vocals. "
"Metal vocals?","I'll definitely search that up. Thanks so much! "
"Metal vocals?","how goes the vocal practice?"
"Metal vocals?","Good luck, man. "
"Another new song I've been working on, death metal, kinda tech-y, definitely fast, still melodic... What do you think?",""
"Another new song I've been working on, death metal, kinda tech-y, definitely fast, still melodic... What do you think?","It's awesome. I'd offer the same criticism I give my own music. Try varying the riffs around instead of repeating them back to back, also maybe try some changes in between the riffs that are less than 4 bars. 

EDIT:
More suggestions, take 'em or leave 'em. Cut the intro riff repetitions in half. Riff B repeats are good, maybe consider small variations in the rhythm but the length is great. Riff C seems to repeat a lot, I'd like to hear the chug bits extened in that riff every now and then. Riff D is good. I'd say vary the beat int he second half. I think after that the song should continue forward and not repeat Riff C. The little blast bit at the end of riff D was pretty cool soundsing and might be a good lead into Riff E."
"Another new song I've been working on, death metal, kinda tech-y, definitely fast, still melodic... What do you think?","Thanks! Yeah, arrangement is not my strong suit; it's really tough for me figuring out where to put things and if the repeats sound good or not. Normally I'll come up with all the riffs at once while recording and just try and get as much length out of them as I can. I can also get a little lazy in programming the drums ;)

But seriously, thanks for the criticisms! I'll take your advice and go back through and try to get more variation on the track. I'm doing everything all myself, so it's good to get another set of critical ears listening to a track every once in awhile!"

"Another new song I've been working on, death metal, kinda tech-y, definitely fast, still melodic... What do you think?","The drums are good as well, maybe towards the end of the full tune you could get the half time feel in with some breaks or something to round it off.
Keep posting your progress, could do with some more dude haha"
"felling the wrath of writers' block. What helps me get out?","Can't concentrate on writing new materiel. Everything sounds the same or just not up to par with my previous shit. Tried covering songs so I can just enjoy myself and maybe get some new ideas, but found my self staring blankly after practicing and warming up. Nothing sounds the way it does in my head. I'm depressed. "
"felling the wrath of writers' block. What helps me get out?","It happens to the best of us.  What I've found helps me is consuming some new material.  Find some new bands to listen to, or maybe go back to your beginnings and take a listen to the bands that originally made you excited about playing music in the first place.  It's really just about freshening up your perspective and attitude.  

You could also try writing something outside of your genre, just for the sake of having fun.  I've written some funky jams just for fun, and one of them ended up getting used by a friend who has a Podcast, as his intro.  

Another tip is… don't be so critical of yourself when you're just free writing and hashing out fresh ideas.  Let it all flow out, try anything, go as crazy as you can.  Then save your work and come back to it in a few days with fresh ears.  Some of my own favorite tracks happened this way.  Keep in mind not everything has to be a perfect masterpiece.  

One more thing!  Do you have any other creative outlets?  I've recently taken up drawing as a hobby, just simple sketching.  And I've found that sometimes when the music and riffs just aren't happening on a particular day, I'll take a step back and find something to sketch out of a comic book, or a car out of magazine, or just whatever comes to mind.  Now, I'm not good at this at all, but that isn't the point.  The point is to just get the gears turning in any creative way, and build on that momentum.  

In the end, just really enjoy being creative.

Sorry for the long post.  Hope some of it helped!"
"felling the wrath of writers' block. What helps me get out?","It did man, thanks. I've been finding myself drained because I don't have any other band members. I want to collab, but its hard finding anyone with similar tastes I can bounce ideas off of.

I should go back to my roots like you said. I dont have much hobbies outside of this, work and video games tho. Its now really a process in meditation. 
"
"felling the wrath of writers' block. What helps me get out?","I can't stress writing or learning stuff outside of your typical genre enough.

Whenever I'm stuck in a rut I'll go look up some jazz chords and learn how to string them together. Boom! Power chord melody with a ""weird"" Jazz chord thrown in there. Just got a new verse. 

I also found that looking up country (a genre I don't enjoy) helps reinvigorate that dark feeling in metal when I go back.

(Also, Gypsy Jazz stuff is fun and great for getting some new odd strumming and solo patterns.) "
"felling the wrath of writers' block. What helps me get out?","When I hit a wall I start learning other peoples songs.  Or transcribing things from other instruments to mine.  Usually classical piano pieces.  Obviously not note for note but I pick out bits and pieces and apply them to guitar or bass.

Sometimes I discover new note progressions or combinations that re-inspire me to apply to my work.

Sometimes it's merely to keep my brain active in a musical way.

Having a large music collection that spans many genres is extremely useful in this way."
"felling the wrath of writers' block. What helps me get out?","You could just try taking a break from guitar completely for a few days, even a week. I know it sounds like a lot, but if you have been at it for long enough, a week is really not much. I know that when I haven't played guitar for 3 or 4 days, when I finally get back to it, there is definitely more fire than usual, as I release all the shit from the last 3-4 days into my playing. If you are wood sheddin' it every day for several hours, or whatever, sometimes you just get burned out and fatigued. "
"felling the wrath of writers' block. What helps me get out?","Occupy yourself otherwise. You know how you always have awesome ideas when you're in class, at work, or in the shower? Do some unrelated work. Fire up the sponge and wash some dishes (without listening to music) or something similar. Then, when an idea hits, run to the other room and play it out real quick. 

Alternatively, if you're capable of decently carrying a tune, keep a portable recording device on you (your phone probably has an app) and just hum or ""diddly da doo da chugga cha chugga cha"" the riff idea so you can revisit it when you get back to your optimal writing space. 

One more thing. If you have a quick and easy way to record, start making ""riff puke"" files. Just start recording yourself wanking off on the guitar (caffeine helps here). Eventually you'll have a database to pull from and transpose into the correct key when you have a great riff, but you're stumped for what should follow it."

"How to double track distorted open chords without sounding like Deafheaven?","Just [recorded this track](https://soundcloud.com/gpm479/seafoam-different-mix) and I'm wondering if anyone has tips for double tracking those big open chords with distortion and not having it be super muffled/fuzzy/blended together.

I recorded this into Cubase with a POD HD400. Any advice (other than ""stop buying Line6"") very appreciated!

Also any constructive criticism on the actual song is welcome.

EDIT: Forgot to say the part I'm talking about starts at about 30 seconds."
"How to double track distorted open chords without sounding like Deafheaven?","The best thing you can probably do is to lower the gain and bass on each take and pan them a bit further."
"How to double track distorted open chords without sounding like Deafheaven?","I have them almost hard panned, but I'll try it out. Unfortunately I can't really get too great of a cleaner tone with the POD.  Thanks for the advice though, man!"
"How to double track distorted open chords without sounding like Deafheaven?","I see what you mean, it makes the sound really clash. 

It's a sweet riff though. Do you like Mastodon or something? ;)

As for advice, I think maybe try tracking the chords with a bit less gain and hard-panning them left and right will help. "
"How to double track distorted open chords without sounding like Deafheaven?","Hey thanks! I actually barely even listen to Mastodon haha, but I can see where you're coming from.  

They are panned at like 90 each I think right now, so I'll try all the way.  Unfortunately I can't get a great tone less distorted than that, the POD gives me trouble with cleaner tones.  I guess it might just be that.

Well thanks for the advice and compliment!"
"How to double track distorted open chords without sounding like Deafheaven?","Nice riff / tone I'm trying to get a pod hd500x"
"How to double track distorted open chords without sounding like Deafheaven?","Thanks man. I just got the 400 from my brother, still figuring it out. The 500X is supposed to be really nice from what I've heard."
"How to double track distorted open chords without sounding like Deafheaven?","First off I like the riff, very cool chords going on. For chords beyond power chords to sound clear with downtuning you're going to want to lower the bass and gain, maybe jack the mids a little more than you're used to, and tune religiously. Maybe some clearer pickups would help too, I find D Activators to be pretty clear although high-output. Another thing to think about would be to voice your chords differently, I like to play a simple C major triad like:


------------------

------------------

--------9---------

--------x---------

--------10-------

--------8---------

Basically the idea is that the farther apart your notes are spaced the less they will clash with high gain. You could even split a big chord up between the two guitar parts for extra clarity."
"How to double track distorted open chords without sounding like Deafheaven?","Thanks for the compliment!  I actually have an Ibanez with Bareknuckle Nailbombs in it that I plan on throwing heavier strings on an using for this tuning since they have incredible note separation and clarity.  This was recorded on an Epi LP Standard with EMGs, so that should definitely help.

In terms of splitting pieces of the chords into different tracks, could you give me an idea of how you would go about that?

EDIT: Also, when you say voicing the chords differently, do you mean just in revoicing the chords in general, or using different voicings for each track?"
"How to double track distorted open chords without sounding like Deafheaven?","Yeah I bet the BKPs will help a lot with this riff, have not used them myself but have heard nothing but great reviews with regards to clarity. I used to use EMGs all the time but I just grew to dislike the sound of the 81, no warmth and low clarity. I did like my 60 in the neck for a fat lead tone but again not particularly clear for chords.

For splitting a chord, say you want to play a complicated sounding chord like a Cmaj7add9 (not actually sure if this would be the right way to name it but I hope you know what I mean.) For one guitar you could use this shape:

--10--

--8--

--9--

--9-

--10-

--8--

which is going to be a bitch because of the semi-barre on the 9th fret. You could split it up in several ways, I think a cool-sounding way is to change the chord voicing so that you get a tight interval (7-9, 7-8, 8-9, or 7-8-9 of the chord are the ones I'm talking about) and split it between the two guitars. This is because close intervals like minor 2nds (between the 7 and the 8) give this ""screecher"" sort of sound on one guitar with high gain, which is actually pretty sweet for a certain effect in breakdowns or whatever, but to get the whole chord across you're better off splitting them up. So maybe you'd choose to split the chord like this:


--8-------x     

--8-------12

--x-------12

--9-------12

--10------x---

-----------8--

which seems to me like it's gonna sound dope because of the close B-D and the high B-C intervals. So it looks like guitar left is playing some inversion of a Cmaj7 while guitar right is playing some sort of Cmaj7sus2.

This is also a cool thing to do if you just have the two guitars do different inversions of the same chord, or just play the same chord as each other an octave higher, it's going to sound really huge. So I guess I was talking about using different voicings for each track to answer your edit.

"
"How to double track distorted open chords without sounding like Deafheaven?","That is really a fantastic idea, I've never thought about that before. I'm actually really looking forward to trying this out.

"How to double track distorted open chords without sounding like Deafheaven?","Please post it when you do try it out, I haven't recorded since I had an old TASCAM DP-01 in high school so I've never actually tried recording something like this, it's just an idea I've had for a while."

"Just finished mixing the demo for my Epic Folk metal band. Would love to hear what you think!",""
"Just finished mixing the demo for my Epic Folk metal band. Would love to hear what you think!","holy scooped guitars batman! Overall the mix sounds pretty good, my only compaint is that when only the the guitar bass and drums are playing the sound is a little hollow, which I think is due to most of the mids being scooped on the guitars. Even when the keyboards and other instruments are playing I feel like there is still somewhat of a hole in the mix created by the guitars. Other than that its pretty good."
"Just finished mixing the demo for my Epic Folk metal band. Would love to hear what you think!","Thanks for the comment! I appreciate your advice, I will definitely see what I can do with the mids.  There is just so much going on in some tracks, EQing can be pretty tedious haha. "
"Just finished mixing the demo for my Epic Folk metal band. Would love to hear what you think!","Yea, especially with all those folk instruments that come in at various points. If you haven't already I would look up a mixing guide that show what order to mix the instruments in, I think it normally starts with the bass drum and snare, then bass guitar, then moves on from there. You're obviously competant at mixing (otherwise this busy mix would be a total mess) but having a guide to bring you through the tedious process might be very helpful."

Very atmospheric as you say but not cheesy or silly sounding. Song is structured very well to keep it interesting. Love when the tempo slows down around 2:30 and all the weird noises after. Possibly the lead guitar volume could be increased slightly so it stands out a bit more. Apart from that the production is outstanding, what did you use to record guitars and drums?

"Here's my newest song. Lots of atmosphere, riffs, and solos. Let me know what you think! Suntelia Aeon - The Mountain","Thank you! I always appreciate this kind of helpful feedback. I do have that particular track at 2:30 turned down a little bit to make it less in-your-face and to help it blend more into the background, but I suppose turning it up might help guide the section a little better. 

I use a pretty low budget set up when I record. The guitars are done through POD Farm, and the drums are Drumkit From Hell loaded into Superior Drummer. You kinda have to do a bit of processing in both SD and your DAW to get DFH to sound any good, so I'm happy to hear it sounds alright! "

"Looking to start a band in the Boston Area","Hi Everyone,

I'm looking to start a band in the Boston Area.  I've been playing music for 11 years, but I haven't played in a group for far too long. Anywhere in between Boston and Worcester is readily accessible to me. 

My biggest influences are Machine Head, Megadeth, Despised Icon, Within The Ruins, and, In Flames.

I'm a guitar player, but I need everything else, including a practice space, because of this, I'm also open to joining up with any group in need of a guitar player if they already have a practice space, whichever is easier.

I'm looking to see what's out there.  Anyone in the area, let me know if you're also looking, and what your influences are!"

"New 8 string, groove heavy song. Any and all crits welcome.","The lead sticks out too much in the mix. I'm not sure if its the right key or the intonation is off.

That piano thing in 1:50 sounds like some smooth jazz thing going on. idk if thats the approach you're going for, doesn't sound like it fits in with the song AT ALL.

Otherwise you got some good riffs, keep working at it."
"New 8 string, groove heavy song. Any and all crits welcome.","i have noticed that about the lead, and that has always been a problem for me. i can get everything else to fit together, but i always happen to make the leads too loud. the lead, except the solo over the clean section, are being played as written, so more than likely, the intonation is off. i'll have to recheck that.

it actually isnt a piano at the 1:50 mark, but in fact is guitar. wasnt my intention to make it sound like a piano, but it was my intention to go for a jazzy kinda feel. jazz is something that i have been trying to incorporate more into my playing, mostly by way of what progressions i'm trying to invoke. i was trying to make the song sound ""progressive,"" but it would seem that my prog abilities need work.

thank you. i will consider all that you said, and will look over things."

"Not sure if this is the right sub but what's a good metal EQ?",""
"Not sure if this is the right sub but what's a good metal EQ?","For listening to a record? while recording in a studio? For practice? Gigging out? Large stage, small stage, basement?

It's a good question, but you gotta be a bit more specific. "
"Not sure if this is the right sub but what's a good metal EQ?","Yeah this is vague. Even if I were to assume you were talking about recording, I can only tell you so much. There is no magical number or shape that you can feed into an EQ module or program to get it to sit well in the mix. It depends on the tone you're getting from your amp. It depends on how clean or distorted it is. It depends on how many times you tracked it, whether or not you used a mic or went line in, what kind of equipment you used etc...

Generally speaking it's okay to clean up a tone by rounding off the extreme highs and lows, and unwanted frequencies (just google some frequency charts to get an idea of what you want.) If you duo-track it, one guitar should be a high shelf. If you quad-track, put a high shelf in each speaker and do another recording with a new tone. That's all I can really say about that. If you want someone to tell you exactly what to do, or to EQ your tone for you, that's not going to happen. Keep in mind there's also *a lot more* to good production than just EQ, panning, and volume adjustment."
"Not sure if this is the right sub but what's a good metal EQ?","Since this is vague, let me clarify. This is for using headphones. "
"Not sure if this is the right sub but what's a good metal EQ?","ahh, well fuck my shit then"
"Not sure if this is the right sub but what's a good metal EQ?","depends on your headphones.. play around with the frequencies to see what sounds good"
"Not sure if this is the right sub but what's a good metal EQ?","Depends on the mix you're listening to as well. As they say in audio engineering, the answer is always... Depends!"
"Not sure if this is the right sub but what's a good metal EQ?","Using headphones for what purpose ultimately?"
"Not sure if this is the right sub but what's a good metal EQ?","Um, listening to metal? If I'm in the wrong sub, feel free to redirect me."
"Not sure if this is the right sub but what's a good metal EQ?","I don't see the point of EQing the music you listen too. I mean, I'd rather listen to the records the way they were made. That's why I pay so much money for good headphones."
"Not sure if this is the right sub but what's a good metal EQ?","This sub is primarily geared towards people that are making metal music. Ideally, the music should be EQ'd correctly before it gets in your hands (obviously this is not always the case) and no one EQ setting is going to make everything sound better. 

You would probably be better off investing in some decent headphones if anything"
"Not sure if this is the right sub but what's a good metal EQ?","Increase bass about 25%, increase treble about 25%, and keep mids at 0.

"What's a good guitar for playing metal leads and solos? [X-post /r/metalguitar]","Right now, my 2nd guitar is a Dean Vendetta XM, which I mainly use for playing leads, solos, and songs in E and D# standard.

While its nice for a sub-$100 guitar, the tone is still pretty lacking, and the construction is not the best. So rather than sticking to entry level guitars, I feel like I'm good enough at this point to have a pro-level guitar. 

On that note, what guitar would you recommend for playing mainly leads and solos? Preferably, the guitar should have a clean, high, trebly sound, and the price should be &gt;= $400."
"What's a good guitar for playing metal leads and solos? [X-post /r/metalguitar]","Picking out a guitar is very subjective. We dont know what tone you're looking for, whether or not you prefer a specific neck, or if you like floating bridges and what not.

All I can say is find out what your favorite bands/artists are using, go to a guitar center and test out that list of guitars and find one that is both comfortable to play and sounds great. "

"What's a good guitar for playing metal leads and solos? [X-post /r/metalguitar]","I don't think you need a new guitar unless you really don't feel comfortable with yours. Even then, you can get a new neck or make adjustments.

If it's sound you're looking for, maybe get some new pickups like Humbuckler."
"What's a good guitar for playing metal leads and solos? [X-post /r/metalguitar]","To be fair, getting a good set of pickups would cost more than the guitar itself."
"What's a good guitar for playing metal leads and solos? [X-post /r/metalguitar]","Good pickups can make any guitar sound better."

"What's a good guitar for playing metal leads and solos? [X-post /r/metalguitar]","I'm sure this will get downvoted but it's not the guitar, it's you. You should be able to pick up any $100 POS and make it sound great. It's not an insult to you. If it's a $3000 custom PRS or a $300 Schecter, if you play the shit out of it, it won't matter if the ""tone"" isn't good."
"What's a good guitar for playing metal leads and solos? [X-post /r/metalguitar]","Well, there's something to be said about how well you play having an effect on how well the guitar breathes, how sweet the vibrato is, and how smooth and full transitions between notes are. But that doesn't mean tone isn't different between guitars, nor does it mean that some or more flexible than others or designed better for other things. There is in fact a difference between a 100 dollar guitar and a 900 dollar guitar."

"What's a good guitar for playing metal leads and solos? [X-post /r/metalguitar]","Leads and Solos you want a thin neck and probably at least 22 frets, preferrably 24. Jacksons are nice.

Ibanez are good too."
"What's a good guitar for playing metal leads and solos? [X-post /r/metalguitar]","Just so you know $400 is not going to get you a pro-level guitar.

Just go to a guitar center and try everything you can in your price range; personal preference varies a lot."
"How loud do vocalist actually get?","Whenever I go to a concert or see videos of performances on youtube, most vocalists, when they scream, look like they have the mic almost in their mouth.

"How loud do vocalist actually get?","I know some can go really really loud. I think it was the vocalist of Pig Destroyer who broke his mic on stage and then screamed over the entire band without a microphone. Pretty incredible actually, I'll see if I can find it.
But to answer your question more generally, most vocalists are at about shouting level. Some slam/bree kind of vocalists are really quiet though."

"How loud do vocalist actually get?","Yeah I'm a vocalist too and I know that. I don't think he does it all the time though, I think he did it because the song was very short and his mic was broken."
"How loud do vocalist actually get?","I think it varies from person to person. That said, no matter how loud you scream you're not going to outmatch a guitar amp, and those don't shatter car windows. The sound coming out of the PA when a frontman is talking in between songs is already a lot louder than any vocalist I know of could project without amplification."
"How loud do vocalist actually get?","Well, when I'm doing vocals it's like shouting or yelling in volume. Easily drowned out by an amp. "
"How loud do vocalist actually get?","There's a limit to how loud the vocals can be from the speakers when playing live: if they're too loud you're going to get [audio feedback](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_feedback) (e.g. singing → microphone → speakers → microphone again → speakers again and so on, leading to a terrible noise). That's one of the main reasons why the vocals are usually very low during live performances.

&gt;__Audio feedback__ (also known as __acoustic feedback__, simply as __feedback__, or the __Larsen effect__) is a special kind of [positive feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback) which occurs when a sound loop exists between an audio input (for example, a [microphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone) or [guitar pickup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_pickup)) and an audio output (for example, a [loudspeaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker)). In this example, a signal received by the microphone is [amplified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier) and passed out of the loudspeaker. The sound from the loudspeaker can then be received by the microphone again, amplified further, and then passed out through the loudspeaker again. The [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) of the resulting sound is determined by resonance frequencies in the microphone, amplifier, and loudspeaker, the acoustics of the room, the directional pick-up and emission patterns of the microphone and loudspeaker, and the distance between them. For small [PA systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA_system) the sound is readily recognized as a loud squeal or screech.

"How loud do vocalist actually get?","If you pass the threshold of the gate that doesn't matter."
"How loud do vocalist actually get?","It varies a lot depending on what sort of voice you are using. I mean, I find I can get some of my roars pretty loud, but not too loud to do in my room, but I can easily get a strong belted note or heavy metal scream to be far too damn loud for a small undampened space. Seems to be this way in most vocalists I know. I also find that most people have some parts of their roar/scream range be much louder/quieter than others, everyone's voice is different.

On stage all vocals should be gated/compd, so you can't really tell, its brought into level with the rest of the band so the vocalist is in their comfort zone (or at least it should be that way in the mix)."

The vocal sound I'm going for is the hardcore-sounding growl (think Lamb of God). I want to be able to perform grindcore, and my favorite grind band, Birdflesh, uses this vocal style. Any and all advice is appreciated. "
"Vocal advice?","Best advice I can give is if you are new to vocals, regardless of the style you are doing take vocal lessons. I'm a metal vocalist myself, mainly doing melodic but I do I growl and scream for effect.  I took vocal lessons for opera to primarily work on my strength and breathing technique. I wasn't able to growl and scream right away, but I was able to build upon the operatic techniques over time. 

There are a few good dvd's, I think on of em is the Zen of Screaming or something. Worth checking out!


Good luck! :)"
"Vocal advice?","Just started myself, I was going for a more poison the well scream but that aside, the best advice I can give is to force yourself to do as much clean singing as possible. A half hour to warm up before harsh vocals and daily as an exercise when you're going to work or wherever you find some time. It really works even though it doesn't sound as fun.

Hope this helped."
"Vocal advice?","Just practice. I'm just starting to get my sound with it, and you need to warm up and not be drinking or eating anything other than water. Also, you will sound a lot different in a mic."
"Vocal advice?","Keep in mind, above all else, that you're growling from your diaphragm, not your throat, and that if your throat really starts hurting, you stop and try again later. Properly learning metal vocals isn't overly damaging to your throat but fucking up on the way can be. "
"Vocal advice?","Warm ups are necessary. Learning to constantly use your diaphragm takes work. And above all else practice, practice, practice. Don't try to sound like your favorite singer. Trying to sound like someone else fucks you up. Just be natural. Let it come to you, don't force it.  "

"Side-projects: How many do you really need?","This could really be a post for all musicians, but I generally find a tendency in the metal community is to have one or more side projects on the go - generally playing in a band, then with one or more side projects.

Now, the reason to have a project away from a fully-fledged band makes sense - its the idea of collaborating with others (or no one, if it is a one-person thing). However, I find a lot of people ending up with more than one of these, such as a black metal sideproject, a dungeon synth one, an acoustic one, and then an electro one or something, as an example.

Was just wondering what everyone's thoughts on if this is necessary? Could one really lump all their solo stuff under one moniker, or is employing separate project names a good way of keeping individual and marketing your music?"
"Side-projects: How many do you really need?","The way I see it, is that the name of the project is meant to tell the listener (or customer) what they are getting.

So, if you just have 1 band/project name, but put out black metal, dungeon synth, and acoustic records under it, you're probably going to annoy or disappoint some fans. The only exception would be if they already know you to be highly eclectic and expect that sort of variety. But most won't.

For me, a band name is about a style of music. I anticipate their albums because I am anticipating certain musical aspects that I already know that I like. It's not so much about the personalities behind the band. If they wanted to do something radically different, I would appreciate them using a different name for the project. And that would apply equally to a one-man band as it would to a group of musicians.

* Drums: EZ Drummer, Metal! EZX.
* Total monetary investment: Fuck all."
"Original Song (No vocals) Anyone care to critique?","What I liked: I really like that dirty riff after the intro at around 1:10.  It gets real mean around 3:20 as well.  Probably my favorite parts of the track.  

What I didn't really enjoy: The slower riffs aren't really my cup of tea, and the outro part kind of seems to go on a bit too long without really doing much of anything.  

I'd be interested in hearing the other 3 tracks if/when you have them recorded.

Also, props for tagging it as ultra-blast-neo-pop-cereal-core. "
"Original Song (No vocals) Anyone care to critique?","Thanks for the feedback. The slower parts just fit my taste, I think. I like big, layered chords to break up the riffing. I'm planning the other songs to be more riff-based, though.

As for the outro part I agree that is goes on long. However, that part is there as more of a thematic decision as I want the EP to end with a feeling of uncertainty and apprehension, and I think having it go on a little too long heightens that. It might make more sense once there's vocals, but I may decide to shorten it later.

Again thanks for the feedback, and I also feel more motivated to get this thing finished now that I know someone wants to hear it, so thanks for that too."
"Original Song (No vocals) Anyone care to critique?","I used to be huge into djent. Not so much anymore, but it still has a small place in the back of my mind.

anywho

good song man. I liked how you didn't just fall back to the 'breakdown style' of drums during the riff at 1:10. for a song that was recorded using programs, it sounds better than any of the songs my friend and I made through programs so good on you for that one. also good work with some of the fades on the drums. a small problem I have with that is it isn't necessarily realistic. it is difficult to have that much control of a crescendo on a cymbal (at least for me I guess) and I've never really been a fan of the edited instruments unless it is a full band fade like you did at the end, which was cool."
"Original Song (No vocals) Anyone care to critique?","I'm glad you liked it. Is there somewhere I can listen to anything you've made?

"Second Original song done: Obsidian Heart [3:52]","Critique on the mix would be nice. Issues that I'm already aware of:

My mic does a real shit job at recording my clean tone, so that's why the guitar sounds terrible on the first half.

Ideally I can get real drums, or at least a better program. The one I currently use randomly picks one of two options for each drum sound in order to ""improve realism"" on playback. Unfortunately, sometimes they sound radically different, especially on the snare. This is especially noticeable on the last section, where there's supposed to be a snare hit on every beat but instead it sounds like the snare is dropping in and out because option 2 is softer than option 1.

Fun fact: The scream before the final verses was supposed to come in a bar earlier but I missed the cue.

Fun fact 2: Didn't include the link.

"My guitar and rig haven't really changed in 6+ years. I'm starting to do my own production and thought maybe I could use some new gear. Would love some suggestions.","Just a little about me- I've been playing guitar for most of my life (i'm 25). I love it and I've been writing for years and years. I love playing, but I've never really been into the gear aspect of things. Partially because I never really had the money to, but also I have to admit I was always a little intimidated walking into guitar center or something. So, I made due with what I had and tried to be proficient with it.

I finally decided that I wanted to learn about recording and production so I could put an album together of my original stuff. This process has made me wonder if it's time for a change. I've used the same equipment for almost 6 years and I feel like I've outgrown it. Here's a [picture](http://imgur.com/dm43vuq) of all the equipment I own.

* Ibanez RG2EX1 (V7 V8 pickups)

* Fender Frontman 25R

* Digitech RP80 multi effect pedal

* Metal Muff distortion pedal by Electro Harmonix (This is my primary pedal, whch I actually bought this year. Everything else is 6+ years older)

It's not much but as someone who's just a hobbyist I've always been happy with my little setup. It's served me well while in college and apartment life, but now that I have a job and I make good money I'd like to invest in something a little better.

The recordings I do use impulses, so I'm not in a huge hurry to replace my amp or pedals, so I think foremost I'd be the most interested in upgrading my guitar. I would certainly love to get suggestions on everything though since I do just as much playing plugged in to my amp and pedals when I'm just messing around. I primarily play heavy metal and here is one of the [recordings](https://soundcloud.com/user4081301/immolate) I've been working on just for reference, but I keep the multi effect pedal around even though it's like 8 years old just because I like the option for different sounds when I want to mess around and jam.

I think at the most i'd be willing to spend about $500 for a new guitar. I'd love to get some small amp suggestions for someone who still lives in an apartment within roughly the same price range.

I would really appreciate any feedback/thoughts/suggestions you guys might have. Also I wasn't sure if this is the right place to post about this, so if it isn't I apologize!

Thanks in advance!"
"My guitar and rig haven't really changed in 6+ years. I'm starting to do my own production and thought maybe I could use some new gear. Would love some suggestions.","how did you get that bass tone? You're good with mixing, so you're ahead of the game from most people. Deff. invest in a good amp combo half stack if you can like jarhead said. I would wait until you can spend more money on the guitar later. Your current ibanez is sounding tight either way. 
"
"My guitar and rig haven't really changed in 6+ years. I'm starting to do my own production and thought maybe I could use some new gear. Would love some suggestions.","The bass is actually done by a bass lol. I'm using a good bass from what I can tell, but I'm just borrowing it while I record.

Thanks for the compliment and the suggestion!"
"My guitar and rig haven't really changed in 6+ years. I'm starting to do my own production and thought maybe I could use some new gear.

A pick can help bring it out too."

"My guitar and rig haven't really changed in 6+ years. I'm starting to do my own production and thought maybe I could use some new gear. Would love some suggestions.","+1 for Agile guitars especially if you're trying to downtune, you can get awesome quality extended scale length guitars for cheap"
"My guitar and rig haven't really changed in 6+ years. I'm starting to do my own production and thought maybe I could use some new gear. Would love some suggestions.","For $500 you can get a pretty sweet schecter with some decent pickups. Lowest quality I'd go for is EMGs. Active pups get you a nice metal sound, but lately I'm more into passive stuff like BKP. They're crazy expensive though, $450 per set ish..I like Ibanez the best...get a decent Ibanez, upgrade the pups and you have a sick guitar.
As far as an amp goes..for $500 you can find a 5150 on CL. This is THE amp for metal. I guarantee all your favourite metal albums were recorded with some version of this amp. To get the best sound you'd have to get yourself a speaker cab to go with it. 2x12 is the smallest I'd go for that sounds good. 4x12 is better, but it starts to get pretty pricey.
Throw the muff away. That shit's no good for metal. What you want as far as pedals go is a solid Overdrive pedal. Ibanez TS-9 or TS-808 or the Maxon versions OD-9 or OD-808 tend to be the favourites. They tighten up the low end and can really make the amp scream.
Hope this helps!"

"Peavey shoot-out: 6505+ or JSX?","I'm sure such a question come up all the time but:  

I'm on a pretty damn tight budget for a head, I was looking at the bugera 333xl or 6262, but I've found the heads they copy for about the same price (used of course) but I really cannot tell which is more for me.  

I play progressive death metal, so I'd need something that can do a few different sounds (clean atmoshperic stuff, steve vai kinda leads) which the JSX provides but also I need that really intense brutality of the 6505.   

Have any of you tried both, what were your thoughts? is the 6505+ more versatile than I think, or can the JSX do more brutal stuff than I've heard?"
"Peavey shoot-out: 6505+ or JSX?","[Here's a demo of the 6505+ clean channel, for what it's worth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quTmBleedeI)

A Steve Vai sound might be a bit trickier, though. Haven't used the head myself, so I can't help you there."
"Peavey shoot-out: 6505+ or JSX?","I play in a progressive metal band. I used to own a bugera 333xl which i lost in superstorm sandy. At the time i was in a thrash/groove metal band. It was a good amp. My first tube amp in fact. It had its quirks like the low end on the lead channel can over bearing at times. It can also be very noisey on the lead channel. The cleans were ok. Never needed or used the crunch channel. I really liked the amp but decided to go for a different tone after the storm. For about the price you would get one new you can get a used 5150 or 6505+ "

"how to buy a good guitar cheap [xpost /r/guitar]","So i was looking for a new guitar. This will be my second guitar, the first being an Ibanez RGA 42 FM. i like it, but i think its getting old and i think its time for me to change my sound a little. I play metal almost exclusively.

So here is my issue. I have a very specific image in mind for the guitar, but being a teenager with only a summer job, my budget isnt unlimited. Under 1000 dollars is ideal. I cannot find many guitars that fit my specifications, that are in my price range.

what im looking for:

not a gibson or a fender. I have played many friends guitars of both companies, and they are not my type of guitar.

maple or walnut neck 

ebony fretboard 

tremolo 

24 or more frets 

body wood can be alder, maple, or something similar. mahogany is not ideal, but with a maple top, it is ok. 

Preferably some sort of 'metal' shape, but thats obviously not as important

something i thought of was finding a cheap custom shop (if those exist). if anyone knows of one, that would be great.

any suggestions would be awsome, guys, and thanks in advance!
"
"how to buy a good guitar cheap [xpost /r/guitar]","I'd go with a Jackson soloist or a Rhoads with a decent set of Seymour Duncans. That'll be within your budget and give you what you're looking for."
"how to buy a good guitar cheap [xpost /r/guitar]","Agreed, I've got an RRMG, very nice guitar for around $899 (would have preferred SDs than EMGs though)."
"how to buy a good guitar cheap [xpost /r/guitar]","You want to change your sound in metal? Ibanez is typically a very piercing guitar meant to really cut through the rest of the band. Try out a Schecter or a PRS. They both have great options for six, seven, and eight string metal guitars.

Here's the Omen Extreme - http://www.schecterguitars.com/guitars/omen-extreme-fr-2013-11-18-detail

Maybe even check out some of their seven string models if you really want to change things up.

PRS Also has a great series of tremolo guitars around that price-range. They have some great tone if you're into playing something that isn't always meant to be balls-to-the-wall brutal. If that's what you please, try going for something along the lines of a Jackson or an ESP/LTD. Jacksons are well-known shred machines."
"how to buy a good guitar cheap [xpost /r/guitar]","For under a thousand you may have to get a regular neck wood. I would also recommend stainless steel frets. If I were you i would look into getting a carvin. You can get everything you want plus if you don't like it you can send it back"
"how to buy a good guitar cheap [xpost /r/guitar]","No such thing as an 'old' guitar. Beatup, broken, dirty, worn frets, etc. but not old. In fact, a guitar with some age on it that hasn't had any significant problems like warping or crackng is going to be a more reliable guitar.

Sound aside, do you like the way your current guitar plays? 

* Is the neck comfortable?
* Is it too thick or too thin?
* Is it to wide or narrow?
* Is it too flat or too round? 
* Is the fret spacing too close or too wide? 
* Do you like where your hand falls in relation to the bridge
* Is it easy to palm mute the strings in that position?
* Is the guitar well-balanced when standing or is heavy at the headstock causing it to droop?

If the guitar plays well, but you are just not feeling the sound, then a pickup swap would be the better way to go. Different pickups can greatly alter the sound of any guitar. Depending on the year of your guitar, the pickups are either awful or just OK, not great. They apparently switched to a different pickup model in 2011. Also, the pickups are active as opposed to passive. If the sound has been changing on you, did you bother to check the battery? 

If you are set on getting a new guitar, then the questions above will help you focus on exactly what you are looking for. 

Personally, I have a stock RT650 (only made for a couple of years in the early 90's). It plays fine, sounds fine, is very reliable, but isn't as inspiring to play on as other guitars I own."
"how to buy a good guitar cheap [xpost /r/guitar]","I fuckin' love Jackson guitars."
"how to buy a good guitar cheap [xpost /r/guitar]","Check out Agile guitars. I bought a used [Interceptor Pro](http://www.rondomusic.com/interceptorpro727ebtgreen.html) off ebay (mine was a silver burst) as my first 7 string, and have absolutely loved it. They also have other designs that might interest you, as well as a sort of custom shop to pick your features. 

Also, would recommend PRS. Within your price range, you could pickup a guitar from the SE line for around $700, and use that extra cash to swap out the pickups for something more metal oriented. Or, if you can go a little over your budget (or find a good deal), take a look at the S2 line. "
"how to buy a good guitar cheap [xpost /r/guitar]","I'd highly suggest finding a good RG Ibanez off craigslist. A lot of time people let them go so cheap because they have problems with the Floyd rose. 

Simple trick to set the bridge on them is pull the arm full up so the string have no tension on them. Then simply place a double A battery under neath the bridge. You'll see the back part where it curves and that'll set the bridge in perfect place to be level with the body. If it still can't hold a tune after that you simply go to a guitar store or online and replace any of the screws. 

I know this sounds so cheap, but I've played for over six years and I was shown this from a dude that played for his entire life and was in his 40's. He could play anything and it was the coolest trick with a guitar I've ever ran across. 

Again it's just a cheap way to block the Floyd rose off.  Works every one I've ran across, hold tune. 

The reason I also suggest Ibanez is they have some great stock pick ups. Even more so with the older ones. I can't tell you how many old black RG's I've picked up, but a few hours of work and had them just sounding amazing. 

Played them side by side to les pauls Jackson &amp; fenders and that thing would just smoke them. You have a very wide range of tone you can get out of it. 

Also you can find a lot of cool stuff on [Jemsite](http://www.jemsite.com/) and buy really good parts from a site called 
[Dragonfire](http://www.dragonfireguitars.com/) I've used their humbuckers a few times and I really enjoyed them. Even more so for the price, they also offer custom nobs pickguards and a bunch of cool other little things to make your guitar sound good &amp; look cool. 


If you hit up your local Craiglist &amp; run across anything Ibanez you'd like to know about feel free to message me for more input on it! They also have the best necks. Anything with a Wizard II is just amazing, feels great and gives you great fret board control. 

I love any guitar that sounds good. I don't care about the name on the headstock. With that being said I've found most Ibanez guitars to be the best bang for the buck and the most well rounded to play. 


Sorry that was super long, I'm just kinda got on a roll. Guitar nerd &gt;___&lt; "
"how to buy a good guitar cheap [xpost /r/guitar]","If you want to buy a new guitar you need to under stand the basics of a quality guitar.  Try out every kind of channel (dirty and clean). Play it for a solid 20 minutes before you buy it, and think of what you need it for playing.If you are rhythm Jackson soloist guitars are just going make you struggle with tone that much more, if you are playing lead then make sure every fret sounds perfect when you pick a note extremely hard.I'm in a band playing with an ESP MH 1000 and a PRS SE series, I've had them both for over three years and I still don't think about getting a new one because I took the time to consider what I was buying."

A big problem I have is that I tend to come up with like an intro and maybe a verse or bridge, then I just get stuck.    

For the ones in guitar pro I have my own really shitty drum parts that I put together, but nothing like what an actual drummer can do.   

So in any case take your time and heave fun with it. Maybe we will be able to help each other out.   

I'm also working on a couple of punk rock type songs, mainly influenced by The Misfits but right now they need *a lot* of work."
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","I'm the same way with writing guitar parts. I can play a little, but I struggle with finishing a song. That's why I come on here to work with folks who can haha. 

I'm into punk as well. I love a good punk influenced metal band. "
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","Awesome! When I get a little farther into.those tunes I will link them for you. "
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","Sweet. You have guitar pro? I will send you a few things when I get home!"
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","I use Reaper. "
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","not used that one before, any good? "
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","I like it. I don't know a whole lot about it really. Just enough to track drums from an electronic kit. I'm using ezdrummer, so it sounds pretty decent. "
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","That's cool was gonna look up some tutorials on it anyways, can you get good sounds out of it?"
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","https://m.soundcloud.com/christophersmith-15/untitled here's a track with drums I recorded. Another redditor did the guitars. It's obviously still unfinished and the drums can be mixed better, but you get the idea. "
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","Haha holy shit you're way out of my league. My stuff will suck now."
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","Nah, give it a shot. We'll make something cool together. :) "
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","What kind if edrums do you use? Do you have any issues with latency?"
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","I have Roland TD 11 and there isn't much of a latency issue. There is a slider that allows you to reduce the latency in Reaper. I have a crappy laptop that I'm using, so there is a slight delay, but it's only noticeable when I play really fast.  "
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","Are you having latency problems? One thing that I didn't understand from the start is that I should plug my headphones into my TD-11 module(not the computer) and use the AISO driver that it comes with in Reaper. I started out running my headphones from my computer, so the AISO driver wasn't playing anything back and I couldn't understand why. All of the other drivers that I tried had big latency issues. I figured it out on accident."
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","Reaper's a DAW for recording. There's a 60 day trial period but it doesn't expire so it's shareware, but the license is only $60 for personal use which is pretty decent given that it's a pretty powerful.

I do find that combining Audacity with Guitar Pro is a great way for sampling drums."
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","This is a thrash piece me and a friend did a while back. If you can add drums to it, that'd be pretty cool.

Sorry for the terrible audio quality, though. At the time, we were only using Garageband and USB guitar cables to record stuff. We'll probably rerecord this at some point once I get my new interface.

http://m.soundcloud.com/haaris-sohail/thrash-metal-symphony"
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","Awesome, I like it. Do you have a click track you can put with it? That will make things a lot quicker for me. "
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","Aw crap. Sorry dude. When I record guitars, I almost never use metronomes or click tracks. I could make a click track if you want, though."
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","I used to hate click tracks until I was forced to use one to record. Now I pretty much have to have one haha. It makes things a lot easier. If you can put one to it, that'd be cool. I can also try to map it out. "
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","how do I record click tracks with my reaper file?"
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","First, enable the metronome button(it's in the group of buttons just under the file menu at the top left -- right click the button to edit how it functions). Then you set the tempo/bpm with the 'tap tempo' button. You can either tap the button repeatedly with the speed you want, or you can just type it in. If the song has tempo changes, you can add a tempo change marker by right clicking on the timeline up top, and clicking 'insert tempo marker'. 

If my explanation is confusing, just check out the user guide in the help section, or just google it. 

If you're planning on re-tracking the guitars anyway, then just do a simple scratch track for me to play drums to, then do a proper tracking once I have drums for ya. "
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","I jammed a bit on that tune and I have some cool ideas for it. I tried making a click for it, but the guitars speed up and slow down here and there, and I'm not good enough with reaper to work it out. If you can re-record the guitars with a click, then I can track the drums. Don't spend too much time on it, just get a basic scratch track and then you can re-track the guitars over the drums. "
"Guitarists: upload some riffs for me to add drums to.","I'll probably download the MP3 of the track and make a click track to it in Garageband. Should be ready in 2-3 days, since I'm busy with homework right now."
"Bass vs. Guitar","What do you guys recommend I start playing, Bass or Electric guitar?

I love listening to both and I already play acoustic. I would like to play electric but comparing the difficulty of guitar tabs to bass tabs, bass looks a lot easier. Halp. 

Also, please recommend some good beginner guitars (bass and electric)."
"Bass vs. Guitar","My only comment is to not do what is easier. Do what you would like. I played acoustic guitar in the beginning, then switched to bass. I wanted to try something different. I still play guitar, and generally write everything on guitar for my band. It also depends on what you are playing, if you want to play bass in a tech death band, it's going to be difficult. I would go with what you are maybe more comfortable with now, then after you have become more fluent in your abilities, try playing bass. "
"Bass vs. Guitar","If you like both the same, I'd recommend bass, because there's lots of guitar players out there and not many bass players (at least where I live).

Look into Squier guitars/basses. They're cheap, have good build quality (for the price) and are good for pretty much every music genre. If you only plan on playing metal, maybe look at the lower end of LTD and Schecter."
"Bass vs. Guitar","Bass is fun, and bass players are always able to find gigs. As much as I love playing mine, I'm still a guitarist at heart. Gotta have that power chord crunch.

Fender (Squire) makes some good low-end instruments. For metal, make sure any guitar you buy has a humbucker pickup in the bridge position."
"Bass vs. Guitar","Play whichever you want... I'm sure you'll end up owning and playing both anyway so you may as well start with guitar because as you said it's more difficult to learn. Plus anybody who can play guitar can pick up a bass and do a decent job of playing it but the reverse is not true. I'd recommend something from the LTD 50 series to get started on.

edit - [this](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/guitars/esp-ec-50-electric-guitar) is a good deal on a really nice starter guitar (I still play my f-50 and it's hella decent), [here's](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/bass/esp-ltd-b-50-bass-guitar) a similar quality choice for bass"
"Bass vs. Guitar","If you play bass, you'll never lack for a band to play in. If you take the time to actually learn how to really play the bass, you can move up the ladder faster and further than guitarists. "
"Bass vs. Guitar","Play both.  One will probably edge out over the other.  They are both very fun in their own distinctive ways.

It is easier to find groups to play in with bass.

Don't worry about difficulty.  You can make either instrument as hard or easy as you like.  It's all about how you challenge yourself."
"Hey heres me playing ""The Dehumanizing Process"" by Chimaira on drums. Feedback always appreciated!",""
"Hey heres me playing ""The Dehumanizing Process"" by Chimaira on drums. Feedback always appreciated!","Great job! Your double bass control is excellent, and you've got great coordination. The two things I do recommend are that you hit a little harder, although I can't really tell from the camera angle, the drum tones seem a little weak. This is metal! Don't be afraid do go all out! Also, you might want to work a bit on feel. You've got all the notes down, but you should impart a feel to the song and make it your own. I frequently see metal drummers who can play really fast, but have nothing that distinguishes them from the rest of the pack in terms of feel. Don't be afraid to break up sixteenth-notes into lombardo-like fills, or use double strokes and buzz strokes to give your fills a different sound and make them more interesting. "

"Metal Guitarists these days are boring.","Alright. I've been a metal fan for a long time. My favorite was when good Swedish metal ruled the earth. Soilwork, The Haunted, In Flames, that kind of stuff. I'm always on the search for good melodic but brutal metal. But every time I listen to a new metal band these days their solution is just to tune down a couple of steps and chum chum chum. It's fucking stupid not to mention mind numbingly boring. Where are the Lamb of Gods, and Killswitch Engage's of the metal world? Am I just missing them?"
"Metal Guitarists these days are boring.","Sorry, but you are absolutely missing them. I think that metal is at an all-time creative high. I don't know if any of this is what you're looking for, but this stuff is 100x as interesting as anything LoG or Killswitch has come out with in years:

"Metal Guitarists these days are boring.","Listening to Nerve End now. Fucking Rad. Thanks for the heads up. Last Metal band I remember listening to that did it for me was Dreamshade. Their album ""The Gift of Life"" is amazing. 

"
"Metal Guitarists these days are boring.","...maybe don't listen to stuff like Lamb of God if you wanted good music?

There's shitloads of good new bands. But you won't find them at the top selling lists...

Look up music blogs. Google for an album you like with blogspot (or similar) added after it, then find the various blogs where it is available. Look at the latest post in those blogs (get the name and enter it into youtube: they might have a bandcamp too, which is a great way of buying new music). It's been my main way of finding music during the past two years, and it works great.

For example, if you're into At the Gates - With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness, search for [With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness blogspot](https://www.google.se/search?safe=off&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=With%20Fear%20I%20Kiss%20the%20Burning%20Darkness%20blogspot&amp;=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_l=). Now click the blogs that references it, such as [this one](http://melodeath504.blogspot.se/) or [this one](http://maskedjackal666.blogspot.se/) and listen to all the bands that you think seem interesting."
"Metal Guitarists these days are boring.","Thanks for the heads up by the way I'll check that out. "
"Metal Guitarists these days are boring.","You do realize that Lamb of God didn't get on any top lists until their 5th album? Everything up to Ashes of the Wake and part of Sacrament was awesome. Still is. Besides the shitty production As the Palaces Burn is an amazing metal album. If you really think that a metal band isn't just because they got on any top list you may be looking at then you're sorely mistaken. "
"Metal Guitarists these days are boring.","If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself."
"Metal Guitarists these days are boring.","Love it. Tried that once. Didn't go over so well here in Salt Lake. We had tough guitars but our vocalist didn't scream he sang all the time and not many people were to keen on that. "
"Metal Guitarists these days are boring.","Have you heard of a band called Rwake? Although they're nothing like the bands you mentioned, they are the perfect mix of melody and brutality. Check out their albums Voices of Omens and Rest and holler at me. Or look them up on Youtube."
"Metal Guitarists these days are boring.","I haven't but listening to the first couple of songs they are the kind of stoner metal I like. Time to light up and zone out!"

"Metal Guitarists these days are boring.","/r/lerightgeneration is just as relevant for most of the people who link to that...

There's nothing wrong with liking a particular type of music. If you're really into late 60s psychadelic hard rock, then that's perfectly allowed. There's no reason to make fun of them just because it doesn't sound modern."

I like the way you write this stuff, though based on your description I was expecting something more ambient/stoner-y (Electric Wizard-type is what I expected).  Surprised, but not disappointed.  Some aspects of your stuff seems a little Alice In Chains-ish (definitely a good thing), maybe you should bring that out a little more?  

Just my opinion, do your thing, it's good stuff."

"Looking for criticism on a Melodeath song.","I've been working on this for a while now with my brother, and now that it's finally finished I'd like some input from some people who know what they're talking about. Here's the link: https://soundcloud.com/fractionally-human/nuclear-jesus-1

I write/play all the guitars, bass, general song structure, he does vocals, lyrics and programs the drum machine.  We're looking to learn and improve, so give us your harshest criticism on any of that, except the lyrics.  We're perfectly aware of how bad those are, and we're working on it."
"Looking for criticism on a Melodeath song.","It sounds like it was recorded with a potato mate"
"Looking for criticism on a Melodeath song.","I hadn't thought it was that bad... Will work on that next time I guess."
"Looking for criticism on a Melodeath song.","Practice makes perfect"
"Looking for criticism on a Melodeath song.","I like where you're going with it and I think its the framework of something really awesome. The thing that I noticed that I think could use the most change would be that both the vocals and the instruments seem to be fairly static. By static I mean that they're lacking a dynamic quality that I think would really carry the music more and would be more like what I prefer to hear in melodeath, if that makes any sense. I guess what I'm trying to say is I think it needs more melody; it's got the death part, but not so much the melodic. 

That said, I don't really know dick about making music yet. I've been a metalhead for almost 20 years, but I've only been actually learning about music at all for maybe a year and a half, so I'm still quite solidly a noob on the technicalities. 

Anywho, keep it up and I look forward to hearing more from you

"
"Looking for criticism on a Melodeath song.","As vocalist I'm gonna chime in briefly.  I was pushing my low ends very hard for this one, so that could be why vocals were iffy.  We're gonna try to make the next one more in my range to see how it works out.  Thanks for the criticism!"
"Looking for criticism on a Melodeath song.","Thanks, I think I see what you mean, and we'll definitely be looking to implement the more melodic/dynamic aspect in future, I was a little focused on the brutal, Amon Amarth-type sound, but I'm working now on something that sounds kinda Soilwork-ish, so there should hopefully be a bit of growth on that front.  Thanks again."
"Looking for criticism on a Melodeath song.","Guitars sounds like you're running it through a fuzz box, which thins out the sound and loses the ""crunch"" you usually hear in any kind of death metal. But I don't know what your setup is so I can't tell you how to change it. It just sounds more like Minstry than any death metal I've heard

This video might explain it better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZpHkv7hNuY

On drums, the snare is too loud with respect to the bass drum, but I don't know how your program works can't really help you there."
"Looking for criticism on a Melodeath song.","I am using a fuzz, EHX Metal Muff, like it for the squeals.  I was actually rather unaware of the nuances of fuzz/distortion, glad I know now for better work on my tone.  I'm looking into better things distortion-wise, better amp, etc... Hopefully that'll be able to happen before we start into serious work on the next song.
On the drums we were having a *lot* of trouble making the kick loud enough, will do better next time, all part of the learning experience I guess.  Thanks a lot for the input Bro."

"Questions about using Reaper as my DAW?","I've been writing and recording music for a while now and it's going pretty well! I've been using Ableton Live Lite 8, but recently, due to it being the Lite version, the track number limitation and effect limitation (EQ and things) have been holding me back a bit.

So I'm considering purchasing Reaper, since it's pretty damn cheap. I was hoping some people here could answer some questions about it before I buy it!

1) Does it support VST plugins such as EZDrummer and Poulin LeCab for impulses?

2) Does it have its own built in EQ/Compressor plug-ins to apply to the tracks?

3) Is there any limitation to the number of tracks you can have in one project? (Ableton limits it to 8). Same question for number of plug-ins and effects running. (Ableton limits plug-ins to 4 and effects such as EQ to 6).

4) Are there any built-in synth string/piano MIDI instruments that you can use with it, or somewhere where you can download such things for it?

Bit of a wordy post I know, but hopefully someone knows a bit about Reaper! Cheers for any help you guys can give. Also, if anyone's interested, here's what I do: https://soundcloud.com/alasdaircooper-1"
"Questions about using Reaper as my DAW?","Ooh! Something I can help with! I've been using REAPER as my main DAW for a few years now and love it. $60 is 1000% worth it in my opinion if you're considering purchasing. Some other users have answered your questions already but I'll throw my two cents in anyway:

1) In short, yes, REAPER supports VSTs, both 32 and 64-bit. It also supports DX and JS plugins, and has Rewire support (You can run REAPER as a plugin inside another DAW or another DAW with Rewire inside REAPER).

2) Yep, REAPER has a whole suite of (optional) plugins that come with the software for free. There's an EQ, compressor, a couple different kinds of reverb, a delay, pitch shifter, etc. etc. All in all there's about 20 plugins included. They're pretty barebones, and don't have much of a UI to speak of, but they're very lightweight CPU-wise and sound pretty good. Most of them have a few very useful presets too, if you're into that sort of thing.

3) Nope, your track/effect count is only limited by your computer's hardware/ability to play back piles of audio!

4) Unfortunately REAPER only comes with one software instrument, a little synthesizer you can shape the sound of manually. I personally never use it, haven't found much of a use for it yet. I suppose they were trying to keep the install light on your machine, and not include 3rd party stuff that comes with licensing problems. Here are some places I've had good luck finding some free VSTs and soundfonts:

http://www.kvraudio.com/
http://hammersound.net/cgi-bin/soundlink.pl
 

Hope this helps! REAPER is the best!"
"Questions about using Reaper as my DAW?","+1

Reaper is an incredibly flexible DAW that I gravitated towards because it did support all my plugins and it's super easy to use. Try it out for free; 60 bucks is not a lot of money. "
"Questions about using Reaper as my DAW?","I can't answer your questions, but you can download and try Reaper for free to evaluate it"
"Questions about using Reaper as my DAW?","You're right, I'll do that actually and have a look! Cheers!"
"Questions about using Reaper as my DAW?","Short answer: yes, yes, no, and no. But KVR is a good place to look for plugins. Also, search for DSK soundfont player and some soundfonts for decent, free virtual instruments. "
"Questions about using Reaper as my DAW?","1) yes it does support vst. and runs them great 
2)yes it has built in eq. 
3) no track limit that im aware of 
4) i dont believe there are built in strings but there is a synth..better left to 3rd party vsts.

reaper is amazing and would recommend it to anyone looking to record music."
"Questions about using Reaper as my DAW?","Awesome, thanks very much for your help guys! Sounds like this will have to become a purchase hehe. I'm quite excited. I've been wanting to try some quad-guitar tracking for a while, to get some massive sounds going! Thanks again!"
"Questions about using Reaper as my DAW?","I used Cubase for almost ten years; it was just okay. About 10 months ago I discovered and started using Reaper and would never go back. It's vastly superior in every single way. Well, as far as ease-of-use goes anyway, but that's pretty important imo."
"Can you doom on a fretless?","I've always been interested in getting a fretless, most of my biggest influences are fretless players, and the one time I played on I loved it and found it much easier and natural than I expected.  I'm worried however, as I play in a blackenedish doomish death metal band, where my punchy sound is important, that I'll lose it with a fretless.  every fretless bassist I hear in death metal has a very clean tone, as oppose to my heavily driven one."
"Can you doom on a fretless?","Upvote for verbing ""doom."""
"Can you doom on a fretless?","I love doing stuff like that to words, My most commonly used adjective is metal.  And I use science as a noun all the time when Im doing anything requiring any kind of technical skill
""can you ome here for a sec?""
""in a little, I'm doing a lot of science right now"""
"Can you doom on a fretless?","Doom isn't about your fretboard.  It's about the slow, groovy darkness in your soul."
"Can you doom on a fretless?","Imagine the slow glissando (i.e., slide) down to an open note. Doomtastic."
"Can you doom on a fretless?","Exactly! I thought they would sound really evil,  i was just worried it would lunch through the mix

edit: punch, but keeping the original because of the awesome reply."
"Can you doom on a fretless?","I think you can find a way to work around it. Make that mix your lunchbox and eat up."
"Can you doom on a fretless?","All that matters is that it sounds good, noot fitting in. If you like it, roll with it."
"Can you doom on a fretless?","All that matters is fitting into the band's sound, not sounding good alone"
"Can you doom on a fretless?","Why don't you get a cheap one from Guitar Center with a 30-day return policy and try it out, then return it and upgrade if you end up liking it? Run it through a Sansamp, B7K Darkglass, Reco sim, R.A.T., etc.- all the sorts of stuff you would normally play through to get a sludgy tone. I've also only ever heard pretty clean tones from fretless metal players (Joe Lester, Dominic Lapointe, etc.) so I suspect it might be a little weird. "
"Can you doom on a fretless?","Wow...I never actually thought of that.  Even if I don't care for the tone I'd probably keep it because I play a lot of stuff myself."
"Can you doom on a fretless?","Only problem with that would be that cheap fretlesses can suffer from the same problems that plague cheap fretted basses, except with the additional hurdle of being fretless. Could also require some work to get the intonation even usable."
"Can you doom on a fretless?","That's why I said upgrade if you like it ;) I meant it just to establish a baseline for what it sounds like on average. Definitely would not use a GC cheap fretless as a studio instrument!"
"Can you doom on a fretless?","True, but a bad instrument could sour OP on fretless in general. I know if I thought all sixers were like that crappy one I played one time I never would have switched."
"Can you doom on a fretless?","Shining's bassist uses a fretless, and they occasionally get pretty doomy."
"Can you doom on a fretless?","You can doom on anything if you doom right

Overally, it's pretty rad. Has a cool vibe. "
"Some new stuff I've been working on, and I've been improving... I think... Any feedback on anything you can think of?","I definitely agree that the cymbal needs to come down in volume. I also think having guitars panned a little more to the left or right might help with clarity."

I personally don't think the cymbals are too much, but that's just me - I do the same thing you do for drums but in Ableton with Implulse. What guitar/string gauge/tuning are you using here?"
"Some new stuff I've been working on, and I've been improving... I think... Any feedback on anything you can think of?","Thanks. I've been messing around with the cymbals forever and it just boils down to I don't have the right soundset. I need to invest in a metal pack for SD2... Anyways the guitar is a (lovely) Carvin DC800, the strings are Circle K 10-76 balanced, and the tuning is halfstep down (FBbEbAbDbGbBbEb), though every low note you hear is a G, or the second fret on the eighth string. "
"Does anybody here know anything about orchestration? Critique wanted! [soundcloud]",""
"Does anybody here know anything about orchestration? Critique wanted! [soundcloud]","Orchestration is about tonal combinations. Flute + Clarinet = Flutinet. Having certain instruments play identical lines creates a new sound. Want a trumpet to cut through? Double it with the flute and piccolo to add some shrill. Cello not warm enough? Pepper some bassoon on it to fatten it up. "
"Does anybody here know anything about orchestration? Critique wanted! [soundcloud]","Sounds great. Also, your send you to burn song sounds fucking amazing. Very well done. 
"
"Does anybody here know anything about orchestration? Critique wanted! [soundcloud]","This is pretty solid compositionally. Some tips if you want to plan on making a really serious project: 

Look up pictures of how orchestras are arranged physically. Write your parts accordingly, especially for strings. For example, instead of loading up a sample patch called something like ""strings ensemble,"" load up separate patches for each. That is, violin ensemble, second violin ensemble, viola ensemble, etc. Instead of part writing all voices to the same patch, you can compose them for a separate instrument, clearing up the way for some awesome sounding separation later down the road when you get to the mix stage. Cellos and double basses are iffy--reserve them for intro/interlude/outro type passages, as during the full-on metalness you've already got drums, bass, and guitar occupying a lot of low end. 

Secondly, get ahold of some sample packs that are capable of keyswitching. The only really glaring problem I had with your track was the awkward attack whenever a new note began, it can easily end up sounding ""keyboard-like."" If you have keyswitching capability, you can program different articulations such as sustenuto, fortepiano, sforzando, and tremolo. Having more articulations will allow you to more closely emulate the way real life instruments react with their players, achieving a higher degree of realism. "
"Does anybody here know anything about orchestration? Critique wanted! [soundcloud]","Orchestration is somewhat of a dying art now that we don't actually need physical players to play the instruments. In most genres, especially metal like this, just go with whatever instruments sound good to you (try to balance the pitch spectrum evenly between treble middle and bass range instruments). Unless you intend to have it played with an actual orchestra the type/amount of various instruments doesn't matter.

Sounds great by the way, keep it up. Maybe consider using a little less distortion on the guitar sound, you don't need that thick of a sound when you have other instruments backing it up; it might really clear up the mix. "
"Does anybody here know anything about orchestration? Critique wanted! [soundcloud]","Thank you very much! I'm a guitarist primarily so naturally I have a terrible ear for how much gain is needed. I re-amp from a clean signal, so this can be easily altered. Cheers for listening!"

"Does anybody here know anything about orchestration? Critique wanted! [soundcloud]","That sounds fucking amazing, what did you do the orchestration with?"
"Does anybody here know anything about orchestration? Critique wanted! [soundcloud]","IK Media Philharmonik. It doesn't break the bank and it sounds relatively realistic, got all the sounds you need, you can split the outputs and mess with all kinds of settings.

It's layered with DSK CHoirz, a free plugin which has a good selection of choirs and pads that can be layered to make the ethereal ""Final Fantasy"" vibe. Sounds really cool soaked in reverb!"

"Album concept: The story of a galactic war. Thrash metal.","Hi there.

I've had some free time and whipped up an idea for a concept album: A deathrash album set completely in a fictional scifi universe. I have a friend who's an author and a few decades ago he whipped up a universe for a book that he never wrote and now he gave me the notes after I mentioned this concept to him. 

Would you listen/buy an album like that? I've already written and sloppily recorded one demo.

Gonna really test your limits with this one!

*Background* - 5-6 piece FAMILY classic rock band, 200+ shows.
Been playing together for 5 years, BASEMENT rehearsal space (fully finished, in wood panel, fireplace, and fridge) Room is 24 X 11. Most stages we play are small (less than basement).

*GEAR* - Dad (me) works for big box place requiring a blue vest, so money is VERY tight..... VERY tight. Most gear is 2nd-3rd-4th hand, have some tech skills so everything basically works....basically...

Peavey XR1220 powered mixer-20 channels, 1200 W(total-dual amps)
Peavey Mark III head - used to power monitors (400W?)
Yorkville Pulse 15 (mains).... older than dirt
Traynor YSC 3 (4ft long X 1ft square) with 4 X 8"" spkrs (monitors)
4 Shure SM58 (some clones) for vox
3 Shure SM57 for instruments (amps)
1 kick mic - older than spoken language
2 Marshall DFX amps (50 + 100)
1 Baseline 600 bass amp  (400W???)

1 Keyboard (recently added... non family member!)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Current Set Up -&gt; We are lined up along length of wall (24ft)
  bass,   drums,   rhthym/lead vox,   B/U xox,    lead guitar... 
                                        keys(behind singers)

trying to keep stage ""feel""... we are facing other wall, with boards in center, monitors on floor in front, and mains in corners angled to opposite corners (kitty corner). Amps are lined up along width walls (11ft) and mic'd except bass which is plugged into board as well as is keyboard.

So main board has 5 vocals, one is 57...I know (no drummer vox), 2 guitars, bass, keys, and kick drum. From main board to mains, and aux lines to Peavey head to power monitors.

We get a pretty good mix and really don't have any problem with feedback until vox have to be turned up to be heard above everything else...90% of time this is no problem.. but drummer is heavy hitter even on lighter tunes!!!

When on stage its about 50-50 when we get to use our own sound stuff. About 25% of time do we have a sound tech doing it for us. We have one guy we play with who is excellent and when we have him do the sound we love it (but he lives far away and we can't really afford to be paying him or even his gas!!!). Most of our shows are NON PAYING ...I know.... theres your problem right there!!!!!!!!!!!!!

QUESTIONS:
1) does this seem to be a logical set up, are there things I could be doing better/different?
2) Do I use onboard AUTO EQ, or learn how to do it manually?
3) other than trying to turn everybody down (yeah right!), how can I get louder vox without feeback in small room?
4) WTF is a noise gate? and do I need one?
5) WTF is a compressor? and do I need one?

*Please explain in simplest terms... assume I know nothing!!!!*

I'd appreciate any and all comments and suggestions...
Questions are welcome too.... I guess!!!
My thanks in advance!!!!!!!"
"Newbie needs help for ""live""sound but with no budget for upgrades","I don't have much experience with live sound but i know a few things from a recording standpoint.

Eq - You might find this useful for making each instrument you feed into the mixer stand out more. Think high passing the guitars to make the drums / bass more audible in the low end. It's not hard to learn yourself, if think of it in terms of frequency.

If you're having trouble with the vocal mics, try making sure they stay away from the mic'd cabs and monitors. Reducing the stage volume would probably help too, if you've got a lot of microphones, reducing bleed will help. 

A noise gate could be useful on your drums, think of it like this - You set a volume level, and then any time the microphone picks up a level quieter than that, it will instead just be silent. Useful for a kick, if you don't want bleed in the signal. 

Compressors are useful in the studio, i wouldn't bother with one live, except for MAYBE on vocals. It pretty much evens out the differences between peaks in volume from a mic by reducing the volume whenever the volume spikes. 

Hopefully that helps a bit.
Cheers

"Recording Equipment","So I'm starting a band, and we're fairly young and don't have much money, but need equipment to record a demo. What is some decent equipment for a decent price?"
"Recording Equipment","To record guitars straight into a computer, you'll need either a digital effects processor, or a USB interface (which you'll also need for mics). If you go the processor route, I'd recommend getting a used Line 6 POD X3 off of eBay. If you go for the interface, I'd recommend a Behringer UM2: great sound, zero latency, and only $50.

For recording programs, I'd recommend Reaper: it's free, and is just as good as most professional DAWs out there. And if you go the interface route, you'll need plugins to get a kickass guitar sound. I'd recommend the following combo: TSE 808 (screamer) + Poulin SoloC (amp) + Poulin LeCab (cabinet). This guy has most of the stuff you need in the description: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6PHzkPjH7c
"
"Recording Equipment","This is pretty much what i'd recommend, maybe pick up a cheap version of cubase if you can. The 'vintage' range of free vst's are pretty good, and there are a ridiculous amount of free plug-in instruments should you need them. Also, if you can, compress EVERYTHING on input, even just a little bit, you'll thank yourself for it when it comes to mixdown. "
"Recording Equipment","Reaper isn't free. They give you a free unlimited trial, but if you like it and continue to use it, you really should buy a license. It's only $60, and in my opinion worth way more."
"Recording Equipment","Reaper for the work station and pod farm for guitars "
"Recording Equipment","This is the slightly illegal approach, but my brother and I torrented Logic 10, then bought Joey Sturgis's impulse drivers and mixed the real drum samples they have in Logic for a metal sound. 

We bought all our hardware though; the USB interface, compressor, and all the other stuff you need. "
"Recording Equipment","How is logic 10? Is it complex or a heavy learning curve? "
"Recording Equipment","Logic is basically the simple version of Pro Tools. Pro Tools does more, but it's also a shit-ton more complex. Logic is fairly basic and does everything you essentially need to record music. 

My brother just watched a bajillion videos on it. That's literally the only way he learned and we've been producing professional sounding music for a few months now"
"Recording Equipment","Reaper is the way to go for your DAW. I'd recommend spending a little extra and trying to find a used Pod Hd500. It's well worth the money as a reliable piece of gear and as an effects processor with endless possibilities. In terms of drums, I'd say get an electronic drum kit and superior drummer 2. That way your drummer can play through those samples. Or skip the kit and just program drums if your drummer is cool with not playing his actual parts on the demo. For vocals, any condenser mic will do, I've got a Rode NT1-A that I highly recommend for both vocals and acoustic instruments. Lastly, get izotope Ozone 5 if you want a professional sounding demo. I would also recommend a solid interface, you'll need it to record vocals. Can't go wrong with the Scarlett 2i2. All in all, this would run you around $1,000, assuming you already have a computer that can handle all this. It's well worth it if you're serious about music and want to pursue it."

"Would like some constructive criticism on my bands first release ""A.I."" please?",""
"Would like some constructive criticism on my bands first release ""A.I."" please?","I like it. I'm getting a bit of a Darkest Hour vibe from it. If you really want constructive criticism, the rhythm guitar is really repetitive mainly that the chorus sounds like it needs a little more variation. The vocals are good, clean and harsh, but need more clarity, especially on the cleans. The overall production is good though. Very nice job. What do you play? "
"Would like some constructive criticism on my bands first release ""A.I."" please?","Cool! Thanks heaps, Glad you like it!
Yeah I play the drums! Unfortunately they are a bit boring, but this was recorded awhile ago and since then, I wish I could of re written the drums, but hey! That's whats great about every release"
"Would like some constructive criticism on my bands first release ""A.I."" please?","Personally, I really enjoyed it man. I think you really utilised the different feels throughout the song (e.g the mood changes when you swap between vocal types). In reference to the repetition of the rhythm guitars, sometimes less is more and i had no problem with it. Subscribed, ill be listening out for more of your stuff! Its good to see another aussie band release some kick ass music.

"Would like some constructive criticism on my bands first release ""A.I."" please?","Actually really kick ass dude, fucking solid track. I would have to say my only gripe is vocals seem 'underneath' everything else. Could stand turning them up a bit. Clean vox suffer from this a little more than screams."
"Would like some constructive criticism on my bands first release ""A.I."" please?","Thanks heaps!! Yeah, the guys who mixed our EP were sort of into a different genre, and we had no idea what we were doing ( Being we are only 17 and 18 years of age) 
We still have a lot to learn ;) "
"Would like some constructive criticism on my bands first release ""A.I."" please?","The song is really good, but you guys need to automate things when mixing.  I can hear the limiter kicking in pushing still down.  You need to lower your instruments and let the vocals come through.  If you fix this the song will be pretty much perfect."
"Would like some constructive criticism on my bands first release ""A.I."" please?","Thank you so much for your words! Yes, unfortunately we didn't record, mix or master the tracks and to be honest, we weren't exactly happy with what the final result was, but hey. Nothings perfect :( 
"
"Would like some constructive criticism on my bands first release ""A.I."" please?","Nice trick in the beginning. I did not push the volume up, and still got the surprise. Where y'all from? I love the singing, there are so many bands who rely only on gutural vocals and at this moment in time, for me, it's sing or bust.

Have you heard Black crown initiate? You  could learn a bunch from Jesse. don't say your drums are boring. 

Trick question, are the drums replaced, or processed so that they sound like that? Meaning are they the original acoustic sound? "
"Would like some constructive criticism on my bands first release ""A.I."" please?","Thanks man! The intro was a last minute decision! :) 
We're from Taree, NSW. Pretty rural bogan town, and we are the only people who have been playing music like this in a long time in our area. 
I'll look them up, I have heard of them 
Yeah they are real drums, but they are a bit processed ( I personally don't really like drum sound we came up with, but oh well) "

"Periphery - Ragnarok (Mixing practice)","Thanks for the DI's [Daybreak Studios]( https://www.facebook.com/DaybreakStudioSwe) and for the acapella [Lauren Babic](https://www.youtube.com/user/laurenbabic). My question to you guys is I've a bit conflicted with my mix. In my mind, it doesn't have the same width as it does on the original track. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what to boost or subtract or add in order to get it wider? Also what else is wrong with the mix. Any suggestion helps as I become better every time I post here. Also, the guitars are through Pod HD Pro, the drums are SD2, and the bass is through Zombass."
"Periphery - Ragnarok (Mixing practice)","The guitars/bass sound pretty solid and comparable to the original song. I think where you're lacking presence is with the drums, specifically the snare. In my opinion it sounds like it has a little too much high end and not enough mid presence. The guitars could maybe use a bit of left/right panning as well but the rest of it seems relatively close to the original. I think once you get the drums/snare you'll have a pretty sweet mix!"
"Periphery - Ragnarok (Mixing practice)","I can agree with the snare sounding a bit too thin, but this is even after I eq'd out a lot of the 10khz range... I guess what I can do is use the pitch feature on SD2 to make the snare sound a bit lower to have a better mid range. Thanks! "
"Periphery - Ragnarok (Mixing practice)","Alright, [here is the most updated version.](https://soundcloud.com/iuploadmymusic/ragorock-update-3) Improved the snare much. Improved the vocals presence wise as well."
"Periphery - Ragnarok (Mixing practice)","I agree that the drums seem to be the weak part. For me, the problem (even in your updated version), is the amount of reverb. It sounds too distant, and a bit like a toy drum kit. But other than that, you did an amazing job.

Can I ask for a copy of your POD HD patch? :) Guitars sound nice."
"Periphery - Ragnarok (Mixing practice)","Now that you mention it, that might exactly be the problem. I'll work on it when I get home. I'll also PM you the guitar tone. Thanks!"

"Mixed vs mastered","Does anyone have any links to a mixed but not mastered track and the professionally mastered version?  I am recording my own music and I am struggling to work out what volumes I should have each instrument in the mixing stage.  Any help is appreciated!"
"Mixed vs mastered","As a general rule, it is better for your mix to be ""too quiet"" than loud as it leaves headroom for the Mastering Engineer to do his job. Your priorities should be something like this:


* Make sure NOTHING is clipping. All of your recorded tracks and subsequent processing should not have anything going ""in the red.""


* Once you're sure nothing is clipping, you can start to look at levels more carefully. A lot of Mastering Engineers like to have *at least* 6db of headroom to work with on your mix bus/stereo bus/master track. So, in terms of track volumes, you'll want to find a good level for some key elements in your mix (most people start with kick and snare) and then adjust everything in relation to them. Your end result will likely sound quiet and wimpy (not to be confused with sounding *bad*). 


* If you're feeling particularly scrutinous, look into *Gain Staging* to get a better understanding of where your levels should be. There is some debate as to whether or not maintaining proper gain structure in a digital production setting is absolutely necessary, but understanding gain staging will at least give you some perspective on what to shoot for. 


Finally, I don't think I've ever seen raw mixes released that didn't involve some mastering-like processing, so you're probably not going to find much that is helpful. Even ""demos"" that are released as bonus tracks usually have some kind of mastering and, at the very least, a limiter that has brought their volume levels up so the tracks don't stick out so much from the rest of the album. [Here](http://blackdogmastering.com/Mastering_Samples.html) are some samples from an online mastering service website where you can compare the ""Before"" and ""After"". Just keep in mind that the site is trying to attract clients, so the ""before"" clips might not be the most accurate representations of an unmastered mix. 


So, to recap in short: no clipping. Enough headroom. Good volume balance among individual tracks in the mix. Don't worry about volume comparison to finished products (your mix will be substantially quieter than these). "
"Mixed vs mastered","I would add to this that killing everything above / below certain frequencies can also help tremendously with creating headroom, and will also help a track sound even better when well-mastered.

In addition, for those looking to mix their own stuff I strongly advise finding some tutorials on how to mix using cuts instead of boosts. Learn how to sweep across the band for each instrument to find out it's sweet spots and then create ""room"" for that's instrument primary vocalization range across the tracks. "
"Mixed vs mastered","I would like to add that it's important to have a consistent workflow. When I mix I take everything down to zero (which is actually -infinity because zero is actually the loudest point... but you get the idea) and bring the drums up to around -16db. Then bring the bass up. The bring the guitars up, etc."
"Mixed vs mastered","Thanks I think the main issue I have been having is trying to get that mastered sound in the mixing stage because I haven't heard a professional mixed but not mastered recording. 

Is it the best idea to bounce down to a stereo track or just master on the ""master"" bus after mixing if I want to give it a go myself?

I have a set of m-audio cx5's (but not a treated room) but I am able to reference using my focusrite VRM box and my Sony V6 headphones(not the best headphones ever but the response sounds pretty flat) so I do want to at least give it a go as I am a hobby musician so any advice is helpful!"
"Mixed vs mastered","I'm a hobbyist myself who is recently getting into production, so I'm no expert by any means. 


&gt; Is it the best idea to bounce down to a stereo track or just master on the ""master"" bus after mixing if I want to give it a go myself?


I would personally treat mastering as a separate project by bouncing to a stereo track (or stems if you want more flexibility). My reasoning is twofold: 1) you won't worry about CPU usage and/or messing up your already full mix cluttered with a bunch of plugins, and 2) if nothing else, treating it as an entirely separate project might help you approach mastering from a better psychological viewpoint (i.e., you can see it as a ""ground zero"" that you need to improve rather than something you can go back and tweak a bunch of stuff in). 


My personal view is that people who mix the music shouldn't master the music, especially for home studios. When I pay for mastering, I'm essentially paying for two things I don't have: the ears and the equipment. Even if I'm lucky enough to have high-quality mastering gear, I still have neither the understanding to use it nor the experience/objectivity required to analyze the mix and see where it can be improved.  But, of course, if learning and the experience is your goal as a hobbyist over quality, then this doesn't matter. 


Also, I recently just bought Slate Digital's FG-X mastering plugin to ""master"" (really just bring the volume up) my personal demos. It's pretty solid and was on sale for $100 (though you also need an iLok, which is an additional $50 if you don't already have it). 


Good luck and keep on mixing, my friend!"
"Mixed vs mastered","I think your 2nd point makes alot of sense actually! Thanks I will check out FG-X too.

I am not against the idea of paying for someone else to master it either though but I do like the idea of at least giving it a go myself even as a learning experience!"
"Mixed vs mastered","I forgot to mention that a lot of mastering services will provide a free sample on one of your songs, so you can always ask for a sample and compare it to your own mastering to see if the cost would be worth it to you on important projects. "
"Mixed vs mastered","this guy helped me a lot... of course, he did use some vst that pretty much worked its magic instantaneously:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amN1EmZv4Uo"
"Mixed vs mastered","Thanks for that I am checking it out now.  That actually helped me understand where I am going wrong. I think my problem is I keep trying to make my mixes have that mastered sound and I don't know what it is meant to sound like before mastering so I am making the guitars too loud to get that mastered sound when I realised that the mastering stage brings those up so much when I watched that video."
"Mixed vs mastered","I always thought mixing was the part where you get the instruments and/or effects sounding right, without worrying about the volume that much.

Mastering is the part where you blend all of it together and set the volume levels.

Someone correct me if I'm totally wrong."
"Mixed vs mastered","Mastering is the process that takes a good final mix and brings the levels up to where we are accustomed to ( the argument of if that is good or bad and why is a whole separate topic ). Sonic maximization these days is not just limited to volume, perceived volume plays in a lot in most modern recordings. In addition, there can frequently be other small things done in the mastering process to make it sound larger or more present, like small stereo-separation, etc.

When you bring in a recording to be mastered, you do not give them all the separate tracks ( like your Logic or ProTools file ). You bring in a singular mixed track, so things like adjusting the volume of an individual instrument cannot be done at that stage.
"
"Mixed vs mastered","That was pretty informative! TIL"
"Mixed vs mastered","Mixing deals with individual tracks. Mastering deals with the album as a whole."
"Mixed vs mastered","Yeah I think you are right there.  I think the problem I am having is what volume to have the instruments when compared to each other and how much headroom to leave before mastering.  For example I have a habit of turning the guitars up too loud over the drums which I have realised after watching the youtube video posted above.
This has been helpful thanks everyone"
"Mixed vs mastered","Make it sound as good as you can when mixed. The mastering process makes up for errors done in mixing.

I suggest you read [THIS](http://music.tutsplus.com/tutorials/so-you-think-youve-finished-mixing-a-guide-to-preparing-your-mix-for-mastering--audio-6083).

I personally don't have any unmastered tracks. Both times I've been in the studio the pre-master mixes we've received seems to have some sort of master preset put on them to raise the volume.

"
"Mixed vs mastered","Respectfully disagree strongly.

Mastering does not ""fix mixing errors"" - it exemplifies them. Generally when doing a final mix, you want to have everything sound fantastic and wonderful, and have passed / shelved all items typically outside the audible frequency to create headroom for the mastering process.

Mastering should be the clear-coat that makes the paint job sparkle. If you screw up the multi-stage paint on your car, no amount of clear coat will make it ""shine more"" - it just makes the shit stand out more. But with a great paint-job, that clear-coat really helps provide a sheen that makes it look even more polished."

"Beginner guitarist here, asking for some scale and chord knowledge from fellow metal heads.","Nile mostly seems to use Phrygian dominant (the fifth mode of harmonic minor), from experience.  The Oriental scale is a slightly different beastie, or at least the one I'm thinking of is."
"Beginner guitarist here, asking for some scale and chord knowledge from fellow metal heads.","Learn how to use the minor pentatonic in any key with root notes on 6th string and 5th string. Then learn the major pentatonic to join on to the minor pentatonic. For example if you are playing in G minor you would use the minor pentatonic in G. You could also use the major pentatonic in A# to join on to the minor in G. This is because A# is the relative major to G minor.  Hope this makes sense :)"
"Beginner guitarist here, asking for some scale and chord knowledge from fellow metal heads.","[deleted]"
"Beginner guitarist here, asking for some scale and chord knowledge from fellow metal heads.","Most guitarist start off learning pentatonic/blues scale, as it is relativly easy (5 main notes), solos well off most simple chord progressions, and is the basis for most classic rock/early metal songs. It also allows players to easily start jamming and improvising to songs.

I, however think that if you're going to start off right, you should start learning ALL the diatonic scales/modes, as this will be a strong basis for being more musically versatile down the road. I'd start with the Ionian and Aeolian modes (major and minor scale respectively), and work from there. Learn the shapes/patterns everywhere on the neck, how they relate in terms of step structure, and how they sound tonally (major, minor, diminished).

After you've got a firm understanding of the basics (don't half-ass and cut corners), then you can start looking more into metal oriented scales. Typically, you'll see alot of natural and harmonic minor scales used, as well as what some call the middle-eastern scale, as they are typically given a negative connotation. "
"Beginner guitarist here, asking for some scale and chord knowledge from fellow metal heads.","Metal guitar means a lot of different things across different genres. All in all, while there's some solid advice here, I would recommend you start out by learning as many songs you like as possible.
 
Metal, at least what that means to me, is generally less *jam* based than a lot of other guitar-heavy genres. Songs *usually* aren't written through a process of coming up with a chord progression and scale and fiddling around until you have something.
 
Common chord progressions and common scales show up more because of common taste than because the songwriters sat down and picked the sames scales and progressions."

"Solo metal project....need vocals on them if anyone on here can record some metal vox pm me and i'll send a clean mp3. Also open to criticism.","To beef up your guitar, try recording 2 separate performances and pan them hard L and hard R. It will give it a stereo effect. You can go as far as having 4 separate tracks. 2 track panned hard R and L, then 2 tracks panned 70 R and L. This requires a click track to make sure you play as tight as you can."

"Solo metal project....need vocals on them if anyone on here can record some metal vox pm me and i'll send a clean mp3. Also open to criticism.","If panning that way works for you as a musician, then that's awesome! You might want to consider making a separate mix for people who wish to **enjoy** your music! Let them appreciate the full spectrum of their stereo systems. You don't have to pan your guitars 100% L or R, but anything more than 80% in each direction is ideal. Some guys will pan their main rhythm guitars 100% left &amp; right and only in certain spots have a 3 and 4th guitar at around 50% left &amp; right! There's no wrong way to do it, but you have to remember that if you wish for anyone to enjoy your music, then you MUST cater to them to some degree. Be it in how you pan your guitars to how you blow your dad, people have a threshold.That threshold most likely is based on opinion of what sounds good, and most of that has come from dudes that have been paid far too little to accomplish too much and all of it is more than any one of us can usually expect to make....

"[Discussion] Guitarwriting: Ways to Approach Writing Leads and Solos (x-post /r/metalguitar)","Just reposting a discussion piece I submitted to /r/metalguitar

Back with another couple of videos on leads, solos, and also some basic stuff on harmony for anyone who's not musically literate.

[Basic Harmony and a Bit on Counterpoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDTaTGAAHU)

Here i just reiterate my opinions on basic theory and how much someone ""should"" learn if they want to become a better musician. Intervals, Chords, and Scales are the musical equivalent of elementary school grammer and knowing these things is enough to establish musical literacy and expand the way you hear and think about music.

I also talk a bit about counterpoint and how I use it to create more intermediate harmonies when I write basslines and leads.

[Approaching Leads and Solos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzyyW4_zes8)

This is a boring video where I talk the whole time, but I bring up a couple of things to keep in mind when preparing to write a solo. Namely, does the solo actually contribute to the song? This depends on the music you are trying to create of course. One virtuoso like Muhammed Suicmez will shred on every Necrophagist song, but another like Jari Maenpaa only solos on the appropriate song.

If you think Janick Gers contributes nothing to Iron Maiden and only ruins Adrian's original solos live, you'll love this. 

Then, the rest of the video is an update on my project for like, the 10 fans I have, so ignore that if you don't care.

[Technique for Writing Solos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcmMj2ummD8)

The bread and butter video. First I distinguish between Leads and Solos, at least the way I see it. Then we get into techniques you can use when writing solos - arpeggios, sweeping, and tapping. I introduce a way to write simple solos by using these techniques to create transitions and connect individual melodies. I also do the tapping part to Eruption acoustically on my Jackson for fun

I don't remember the rest of the video and I hate watching them again after I finish editing, but I probably end by talking about my project again since it's tied to the concepts, so again you can ignore that.

Thoughts? If there's anything I missed, or something you'd like me to go into detail, let me know. I'm very close to running out of content and I feel like I've fallen too deep into making videos to just go back to writing music anyway."

There is a really low rumble (sort of sounds like wind blowing) throughout the entire track and for the life of me I can't figure out what it is.

I've tried listening to everything soloed and I can't find the source.

Also, it seems to only be there when I export the track. In Cubase it is nice and clean sounding.

EDIT: Also, any constructive criticism on the mix, drum part (first time programming and using EZ Drummer), etc. are definitely welcome.

Any help would be hugely appreciated, thanks!"

"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","Things I would try: 1. Realtime export 2. Exporting with individual tracks muted until you find the source 3.

Putting a small mid scoop on the entire track and playing it off like you wanted a ""vintage feel"", subsequently winning a grammy."
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","I'm planning on exporting the tracks one at a time tomorrow to try to isolate it. In the meantime, what do you mean by a realtime export?

"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","Nice. The ""Realtime Export"" option is in the bottom right of the audio export panel.

"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","No problem. Good luck."
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","Are you doing anything weird like up'ing the bitrate on export (16-bit -&gt; 24-bit) or anything? Are there any effects running on your master bus? Are you exporting a plain stereo-interlaced file and not some other weird channel or anything? In my experience Cubase does not make mistakes, there is probably something you are doing or some setting you have that is wrong."
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","I'm new to Cubase, so I very well may be missing something.  I just checked the Mix Console and there is nothing on the master channel and there is no clipping on the the master channel levels. 

In terms of the export I've just been using the default settings, which are as follows:

* Insert iMXL Chunk (It's a check box, it's checked)
* Sample Rate: 44.100 KH
* Bit Depth: 32 Bit (Float)
* Export as Wave File

"
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","I bet it's the 32-bit thing. What are you recording in, 16-bit or 24-bit? I've never heard of using 32-bit to record. Export in the same bit-depth you record in, any other number doesn't make sense. More and more people are using 24-bit to record, but a CD will only support 16-bit so you'd have to downgrade the bit-rate and dither it. Anyway, try exporting in 16-bit and 24-bit and see if there is any difference.

Not sure what iMXL chunk is, I probably have an older version of Cubase than you."
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","Thanks, that's really good information to know. 

Is there a way to check the bit rate I'm recording in?"
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","Should be under project settings. That's where you set the sample rate as well. "
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","Ah, thanks so much for all the responses dude.

If you don't mind, could you give me a brief explanation of what Bit-Rate and Sample-Rate do? I think I have a basic understanding of sample rate, but bit-rate I don't."
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","First you have to consider what a digital audio stream is. When you feed an analog signal into an ADC (*analog to digital converter*, which are generally found in the soundcard or pre-amp outputs), you are essentially feeding a small, alternating voltage through the ADC. This analog voltage is usually generated from such sources as: a guitar pickup output, a microphone output, etc. From there, the ADC *samples* the voltage into a digital format. What you end up with in your digital waveform is essentially a digital model of the analog voltage you are sampling.

Sample rate is how many times per second the ADC *samples* the analog voltage. Bit-depth is how many bits you can represent the amplitude (volume) with. The way I like to think of it is like steps. If you are recording in 16-bit, you have 2^16 different steps with which to represent the volume with. 2^16 = 65536 (or 65535 if you include 0, which ADC's do.) This means that your ADC has 65535 available ""levels"" to sample the analog voltage at. If you zoom in super close to a digital waveform, it will basically look like stairs, and this is because you are looking at the limits of the ADC's ability to sample a purely analog signal. Then you have to consider that the voltage/signal swings from positive to negative, so you only have 65535 *in total*. On either the positive or negative side, you have half of that, 32768.

So when we put the two together, let's say you are recording at 16-bit, 44.1kHz (pretty standard), that means your ADC is tapping/sampling the analog source votlage 44,100 times per second, with an accuracy of 65,535 positions in total. Another way to think of bit-depth is to consider +32,768 as the absolute loudest sample you can possibly have before digital clipping occurs.

The reason recording in higher bit-depth and sample rate is good is because it more accurately mimics the analog signal. I like to record in 24-bit / 96kHz, which means the ADC is tapping the source voltage 96,000 times per second, with 2^24 (or 16,777,216 -- WAY more) available levels to represent the volume/amplitude.

Another issue is the *Nyquist frequency*, which basically states that the maximum frequency a digital system can replicate is actually half of the sample rate. This is because the most crude, yet complete cycle of a digital waveform requires at least 2 bits to represent. This is a horrible, saw-tooth waveform, with 1 sample representing the peak of the wave and 1 sample representing the trough of the wave. If you record at 44.1kHz, the highest frequency you can capture is half of that -- 22,050Hz. And even then, it will be a nasty saw-tooth waveform. At 96kHz, the highest frequency you can capture is 48kHz, which is easily far above the range of human hearing. This means that the frequencies that *ARE* at the top end of human hearing (usually around 20-22kHz) are more accurately represented, rather than being mocked-up as a shitty saw-tooth waveforms. High frequencies are stuff like the wash on cymbals or sibilance in speech. It's the air in the sound. Quiet, but noticeable. As much as people knock it, you need clarity at the very high-end of your spectrum. It's one of those things that is almost impossible to nail down but when you hear a great recording done in 24/96, you can hear it.

For what it's worth, I would recommend doing all rough-drafts/demos in 16/44.1 and anything you release, do it in 24/96 or 24/88.2 if you can. Like I said, I've never heard of anyone doing 32-bit recording, and even then, I wouldn't advise it. *Floats* are a type of data that are inherently prone to rounding errors due to the limits of the way CPUs handle these types of data, and I'm not sure the benefit would be worth the increased file size and processing requirements."
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","Wow. Thank you for the amazing response man.  Not only did that satisfy my curiosity and give me enough knowledge to roughly understand, but the depth you went into made me really understand what is going on, which I think will really increase my ability to utilize different settings more effectively and actually know why.

Taking some of the mystical behind the scenes bullshit out of what the different settings mean makes me a lot more comfortable with using the program/dealing with recording. 

EDIT: I just checked the project settings, it's recording as 16/44.1, so I think you nailed it with the wrong export bit-rate.  

So Exporting at a higher bit rate than it's recorded at will basically force the audio to split up into more volume steps which distorts the audio?

Also by the way, even if this has nothing to do with that rumbling, I still appreciate immensely. It's been really useful stuff to learn and you explained it really well.

"
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","No worries, glad to help. The thing about digital recording is that it is basically an art unto itself. Sure, you're a musician. That doesn't necessarily mean a thing when it comes to digital recording. It helps to know a bit about how computers operate as well. I know from my old programming days that a *float* data-type is basically a digital representation of a decimal number. Since the computer works with 2-bit logic (0 or 1), every step further down the decimal you go (tenth, hundredth, thousandth, ten-thousandth, etc.) inherently increases the amount of data required to accurately represent that decimal place. At a certain point, accuracy just goes out the window. 16-bit and 24-bit bit-depths are an *int*, IE: an integer, which is a nice clean whole number and is much more easily (and more importantly, with full accuracy) represented via 2-bit logic. You can have 32-bit ints, but the fact that the makers of Cubase have specifically written ""(float)"" next to 32-bit means that when you record in a 32-bit depth in Cubase, it is storing all the values of your waveform under a float data type.

Anyway, if you are exporting at 32-bit and recording at 16-bit, you're basically exporting at a level that is magnitudes above the level you recorded at with no actual gain.  16-bit is 65,535. 32-bit is 4,294,967,296. That's 65.5 thousand vs. 4.2 billion. It's like taking a photo with a nice DSLR camera, exporting the photo as a .JPEG with high compression, then renaming the file to the native file format the camera uses and expecting the quality to jump back up. It doesn't work that way. It doesn't force the audio to do anything, it shouldn't change your audio signal at all. All it will do is take up way, way more filespace for no reason.

My guess is that the source of your problem is that your soundcard does not support 32-bit audio streams in any manner and when you feed it one, the soundcard driver and/or the hardware itself trips out and chokes on the data-stream, essentially. 

As I mentioned, just export in the same bit-depth you recorded in. It's better to start higher and downgrade later if you need to (IE: record in 24-bit then dither down to 16-bit if you have to). If you've recorded in 16-bit, there is no way to go to 24-bit or 32-bit. The notion is literally meaningless.

EDIT: If you are wondering why they don't just use ints instead of floats for 32-bit recording, the issue lies in the fact that a digital waveform has to include positive and negative values, because it is modeling an analog alternating current, which intrinsically contains positive and negative values. A 32-bit int is a special type of int called an *unsigned int* which means it ""has no sign"" as in, no + or -. It is positive only, though the notion of positivity is meaningless when there is no negativity to compare it to. It *only* goes from 0 to 4.2 billion. If you try to do some negative-number math with an unsigned int, you get errors. What I'm looking forward to is a full implementation of the new 64-bit CPUs into audio recording. This means we could have 64-bit floats, and 32-bit int recording. 64-bit float would be 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 (18.4 quintillion) available steps to represent volume, which is frankly rather insane. 32-bit ints is probably all you would ever need for listening purposes. However, with 64-bit depth you could get into some other strange uses for digital waveforms which are outside the realm of audio/listening. Of greater concern, beyond the 32-bit depth point, is a higher sampling rate. I'd rather have 32/192 as the norm, vs. 64/96 as the norm. Most people probably think I am nuts, though!"
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","Another thought I had is that your buffer size may be too small or too large. Are you using a fully supported ASIO soundcard? Sometimes if your buffer size is too small, you can get weird artefacts. A smaller buffer size nets you a lower latency time, because it fills and dumps the audio buffer from the soundcard into your computer more frequently, but if your computer can't keep up (CPU too slow or HDD too slow or both, etc., etc.) then you get weird negative effects. Definitely you should export in 16-bit if you record in 16-bit but also check out your buffer size. Set it as low as you can go before you start getting weird artefacts in your sound like pops/clicks/bird chirps/etc."
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","That's another good point.  I generally set the buffer pretty low, maybe 5th lowest on a 6 point scale.  I've never noticed any artifact issues like clicks and pops though. I'm running a dual core i7 with multi-threading.

I exported it at 16/44.1 and the rumble is still there but seems to be a lot less noticeable."
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","Should be good then. Another thing you can do is schedule your CPU to give priority cycles to ""background processes"", which includes dumping incoming audio streams from the bus into memory. I'm still on WinXP so the method is likely different for me. But I right click My Computer -&gt; Properties -&gt; Advanced tab -&gt; Under Performance click Settings button -&gt; Advanced tab again -&gt; Processor scheduling -&gt; Background processes.

There is something else wrong if you still have the rumble. What did you record with? Did you set a HPF on any of your tracks? It maybe be that one of your mics just picked up some very low level frequencies and you never EQ'd them out."
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","I recorded direct with a POD HD400 and used EZ Drummer for the drums, so not a mic issue. I'll end up re-recording it at some point anyway I'm sure, so I'm not incredibly concerned anymore as long as it doesn't keep happening with new tracks.

I haven't recorded anything since, so I'm not sure if it will keep happening. If it does then I'll really have to figure out what's up with it.

"
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","Ahh... that's interesting. If you recorded direct with your POD HD400, you probably want to take a look at the sample rate of that thing and make sure it matches with your sound card. How are you feeding the signal? Via TRS (headphone jack) or XLR, or is it a digital feed? If it's a digital feed, you need to synchronize the timing crystals on both devices with a master word clock. You can do this by setting one device as a master device and the other as a slave device. Slave devices read the word clock from the master device's internal crystal for accurate synch across devices. OR, you can get a dedicated word clock device (like Big Ben), whose sole purposes is to synchronize other devices. This is likely excessive if you only have 2 devices. Keep in mind this only applies if the output signal is digital.

You have to do this because otherwise the two devices are basically sampling the signal at different times, in an absolute sense. So, say device 1 takes its first sample at 0.000102 seconds, whereas device 2 takes its first sample at 0.000104 seconds, simply because the crystal is different in both. These numbers are purely demonstrative, but the point is that if the samples themselves are not lined up to some reference point, then the two streams are shifted by a certain amount and you end up with crap like low-end rumble."
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","Ohhhhh, shit that makes sense. So basically like beats between close frequency notes, but with sample rates instead?

So I'm recording:

Guitar-&gt;Instrument cable (TRS?)-&gt;POD-&gt;USB cable -&gt;Laptop

Basically I need to sync the laptop/Cubase and the POD?

EDIT: Also, how do I going about syncing the clocks haha?

Also, would this only affect the export, like what is happening, or would I hear it in the DAW as well?
"
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","OK, if you're going USB cable from the POD then that might change this. Does the POD show up as a sort of ""fake"", separate sound card on your computer when you plug it in? Then you select that sound card in Cubase? Or do you have another sound card that you're using in addition to the POD? If it shows up as a separate sound card and you select it in Cubase, you should have no problem with clocks needing to be synced, because technically you are only using one device in Cubase to record and listen back (the POD.) However if you are also using your main sound card in addition to the POD, you may run into issues. Before worrying about clock stuff, check the sample/bit-rate of the POD and match your Cubase project settings to it. It may be that the POD is recording in 48kHz and if you're recording/exporting in 44kHz you may hit issues there.

In fact... quoting the manual for this thing:

*Sample Rate Converter Active:
You’ll see this indicator light up whenever the
device is operating at a sample rate other than its **native 48kHz rate**. In addition to 48kHz,
POD HD supports 44.1kHz, 88.2kHz and 96kHz rates by utilizing an internal sample rate
converter. Please check your specific software’s documentation for details on configuring
its audio sample rate.*

It looks like 48kHz is the native sample rate. I bet that is your problem right there. Change Cubase to 48kHz and try an export and see what happens.

As for how to sync clocks, typically you need some sort of optical/coaxial connection between the two devices. I'm kind of thinking the POD does not require this. Typically synching clocks/crystals is only necessary on higher end, pro-level gear. I'm not really familiar with POD stuff. Does this device have any sort of firewire, or optical, or coaxial connection? Or anything at all other than USB or TRS?"
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","So much I didn't know haha. 

The POD just shows up as a device and in Cubase I set the driver to the Line6 POD ASIO driver

So should I also change to *record* in 48kHz when using the POD? Because right now it's recording 16/44.1

Also, it only has TRS inputs, it has stereo XLR outs and one USB out.  

I've tried going from the XLR outs to my Scarlett 2i2 to my computer through USB out, but I had just gotten Cubase and had issues setting up the inputs. Haven't tried again since, you think that might be worth it or pointless since the POD has a soundcard?"
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","On my phone have to be brief. Sample rates and bit rates need to be matched across the board on every single device. Yes Cubase needs to be matched to record at the same sample rate as the output of the POD which is 16/48kHz native. More later. "
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","As for the XLR out into your Scarlett 2i2, it is something to consider. However you have to remember that every time you add a device to the chain, your signal quality inherently degrades.

If you are going POD -&gt; 2i2 -&gt; computer, there is almost two entire cycles of ADC -&gt; DAC (**a**nalog to **d**igital **c**onverter and **d**igital to **a**nalog **c**onverter) happening. The POD converts your pickup output (analog) into a digital stream, does the modeling, converts it back to analog (XLR output), the 2i2 takes that analog signal, again converts it to digital, does whatever it does, then feeds it to the computer via USB. I'm not clear on what the 2i2 does, it sounds like like a small 2in2out pre-amp interface or something?

I would avoid it if you are using the POD. If the POD already shows up as a sound card that you can select in Cubase, and there is no functionality that you are missing that the 2i2 has, there is nothing to be solved by adding the 2i2 into the chain. However if there is something that the 2i2 does that the POD can't do, that you really want, you may want to add the 2i2 into the chain."
"There's a low rumble throughout my track every time I export it. Help?","Yeah that's what I figured about adding the 2i2 into the line, well at least about the signal degradation, didn't realize that it would be converting back and forth like that from the POD to the XLR.

Alright, so I'll try recording in 16/48 soon and see if that helps!"

"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","As /u/SolomunKull said, it's severely let down by the mix and especially the drums. I don't know what software you use but there is enough freeware available to get a much better sound than you currently have. You might want to consider reading up on metal production techniques - there's a lot over on the Andy Sneap forum on Ultimate Metal.com, for example."
"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","Do bear in mind the audio quality on both soundcloud and bandcamp is awful,  Havent had any complaints about the actual mp3's yet. I've gotten similar complaints about all the online files though, it sounds a lot more grainy and hardly any bass. I have gotten a lot better at mixxing but there's only so much i can do. It's just a demo EP but again, i do see your point. I'll check out the forums. Thank you"
"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","It's not the audio file quality that's the problem, it's the mix, the tone, the panning, etc. I've heard plenty of bass-heavy mixes online so it's not Soundcloud stripping that out, for example. I appreciate it's only a demo EP but people judge you on what you release and standards expected of demos are a bit higher these days. "
"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","Okay, i have a lot to learn about mixing, That is obvious. Trying to learn as much about it as possible but it's a slow process. Messing around a bit now with cubase and i can make some slight improvements but i'm clearly not a master at this. I see why bands let other people do this, haha. "
"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","I like the songwriting, but the production and programming of the drums turns me off."
"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","Thank you, It's the best i can do at the moment sadly. It sounds a lot better on actual mp3 i'll add but i do see your point. I do play drums myself but properly recording it is way beyond my budget.  I hope it's something i can improve on in the future if i sell a few copies . Thanks for the feedback"
"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","Reading a lot of people getting similar complaints when using these uploads. The bandcamp download was uploaded in the highest possible audio quality but both bandcamp and soundcloud play everything in 128kb/s max . I am trying to work on improving all the time so i appreciate the feedback. The mix didnt ever really bother anyone so i was just looking up what the problem could be. It's probably a bit of both"
"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","It's not the mixdown quality of the file, it's the actual mixing/mastering of the music itself.  It just doesn't suit the music as well as it could, and that's a shame because you've written some pretty decent tunes there.  Do you have the original session files still?  If it's a drum machine, you can just swap out the old beats for new, more humanized beats."
"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","I'm reading up on how to improve the drum sound now. Mixing and mastering is something i just had to teach myself and with that comes the problem of overlooking a lot of things. I wrote all drum tracks in midi and coverted them with cubase into an actual drum track. That's about the extend on my knowledge so far. If you have any tips on this feel free to send me a message on reddit or the facebook page"
"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","A lot of *my* issues with the way the mix sounds have to do with the actual samples used in the drum kit, and the mix of the vocals.  Everything else seems pretty decent, except the guitars seem flat at times because there's not enough panning to make room in the mix.  The drum you've used sound very fake, and you can get drum samples that sound more realistic. 

Do you still have the drum midi files?  If so, I'd love to play around with them and see if I can't get you a better sounding kit. Then I can export the lossless .flac files and you can remix your tracks using those instead of the one you've used.

Regrading the vocals, well.. They seem to airy, and are too prominent in the mix.  A bit of eq, and maybe some reverb paired with compression, would really help.

I think you've got an amazing ep here, and I hope to hear more of your work in the future.  Excellent songwriting, man! Very impressive for a first release.  Makes me excited for what's coming down the line."
"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","&gt; because there's not enough panning to make room in the mix

Exactly. Pan rhythms hard left and hard right unless you have a good reason not to. Bass and leads down the centre."
"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","Trying to get a hang of panning now but it's confusing me quite alot. Hoping i can get good at it and just reupload the tracks"
"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","Panning is quite simple, here's a set of panning guidelines:

* Rythm guitars = 100% left, 100% right
* Bass, vocals, leads, kick, snare =  0% Center
* Crash, rides, cymbals, toms = Pan them outwards as you like them. listen to your favorite mix and replicate the panning.
* Harmonized leads/double leads = I use around 30/30 L/R.

The goal here is to free up space so the sound isn't all garbled up in the middle and gets really hard to listen to.

EDIT: If you have the rawtracks and drum MIDI i'd love to give it a spin mixing it."
"Released my Debut EP! Melodic Death/Doom metal.","not only should you be panning, but learn how to EQ that shit and make an amazing guitar tone:

I'm not  good with handling feedback but i've been getting great responses here. I still have everything. If you have facebook just send me a message on the page and i'll send them. I have just discovered an entire new area in cubase and the drumsound has improved A LOT by just picking a different kit and fucking around with the equalizers, but i could always use help on my  vocal mixing.

"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","So I've been in the process of writing my own atmospheric black metal as a one man bedroom project sort of thing. It's based on Jupiter and the four Galilean moons (Ganymede, Io, Europa, and Callisto), each song being based on one moon, and the intro and outro tracks are a two parter based on the big guy himself. I'm going for a spacey and bright ambient atmosphere that's focused on melody. Think [Caladan Brood](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py6iHvKbDjs), but space themed rather than medieval fantasy themed. As for the recording and whatnot, that's what I'm not too sure of. Since you guys know far more about recording than I do, I thought I'd ask here. Basically what I've got to work with is two guitars (an Ibanez RG350DX and a no-name seven string), a Fender Mustang I amp, which let's me record guitar onto my computer, a Blue Snowball mic, and GarageBand. No bass, no drums, no keyboards, just my guitars, mic, and GarageBand. Given the style of metal that I want to go for and my lack of gear, would I possibly even be able to record this album at all? Could I program all the drums and other instruments using nothing but GarageBand and still make it sound good? I'm not sure if this could even work. I know that black metal is known for its jury rigged recording setups, but every single black metal band I know of used real instruments for everything. I've got a guitar, a mic, and Skrillex's favorite computer program. So is this possible or not? I'm broke, so this is all I have to work with."
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","I recorded this [BM tune](http://pariahva.bandcamp.com/) solely on my ipad in the Garageband app. "
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","If you hadn't told me you recorded that on an iPad, I would have never even guessed that was made that way. If an iPad can do that, I'm sure my Mac is totally capable of it too.


And that's a pretty good tune, by the way."
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","You can, certainly. It requires some software and lots of know-how to sound decent, but it can be done. 

Downside: Good drum samples aren't free, and I haven't yet heard a MIDI bass that sounds like a real electric bass. And without a MIDI keyboard or controller of some kind, you are going to create hours of manual editing a piano roll to create your MIDI data.

If the material's good, you can also get people to collaborate either locally or online to fill in the missing instruments."
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","&gt; and I haven't yet heard a MIDI bass that sounds like a real electric bass. 

Guitar Pro's RSE is decent enough. Drums are crap due to their attempt to ""humanize"" which make EQ hard as shit to work with."
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","My RSE drums are a bit dodgy, they play out of time. Do you know how to fix this?"
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","Double click on the Drum Kit, then take the ""Human Playing"" slider all the way down to 0%"
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","You can find Andy Sheap's drum samples on the web for free and I believe that they're pretty decent samples. There's also a sample kit by the name of ""Erkan's Organized Sample Pack"" that contains the Sheap samples and some other good samples. You could probably find them with a quick Google search."
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","Could record the 'bass' on guitar and octave down in Garageband (I assume this is possible, I've never used that particular software).  Again not ideal but better than midi.

Or even a cheap second hand bass would probably be OK.  A couple of my mates have done this for messing around at home and it's definitely passable."
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","I do that in reaper, i record the bassline with my stratocaster and a clean sound and then just lower the pitch one octave. Not beautiful, but it works."
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","Go for it! There's a lot of great black metal out there that was recorded under less-than-ideal conditions."
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","Yes. It's cheesey to make the quality sound bad on purpose, but if the lofi produciton is genuine, black metal is black metal.

"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","Drums really don't sound too bad. Did you mess around with volume and stuff on different hits to make it sound marginally more realistic and accent the beats?"
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","No actually, the variation between drum hits is built in to the program. What I believe happens is that on playback, the program has maybe a 75% to play sound A and a 25% chance to play sound B. It improves realism by a bit, however, during the very end of the song Obsidian Heart, you can hear an issue with the snare. It's supposed to be striking on every beat but snare sound B is so soft it gets lost in the mix. It's actually an effect I don't want, but it serves its purpose and Guitar Pro is too useful for songwriting."
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","Oh ok, I use tuxguitar which is similar but I think that one has the same hit sounds all the time. So I just accent the hits I want or lower the volume on surrounding hits. This is just so I get a better feel for how it will sound while the song is all in its midi format. When I go to record everything I will probably transfer the midi drum tracks to SD or something and get a lot more in-depth with the hits then."
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","For drums you can get some drum samples [like this](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=metal+drum+samples) and then make a custom drumkit in Garageband [like this](http://youtu.be/S31a7dmu8hQ?t=1m32s)"
"Could I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?","Cool, thanks! The drums were what I was worried most about, being as the default drum kits on GarageBand are so fake sounding, so I'm glad there's a way to improve them."

The head simply isn't designed for this. Personally I think it sounds thin, too much high end (5k plus).

Try this:

* Start at noon on all knobs and your output to your desired recording level
* Actually mix the amp to sound a bit dark, you can always boost frequencies later
* Compress the signal slightly post, shelf at 6-7k and roll off below 60-100hz
* Run your L+R tracks to a stereo bus and then Comp,EQ, ect.

"[DEMO] Hararugoi - Desolation. First try at making a song in my solo Atmospheric Black Metal project, tell me what you think.","For a first demo quite nice. The composition fits the genre, in my oppinion i would focus on the sounds in the next step. The tom and crash in the intro are too high and a bit flat and you should really change to another, more dynamic beat after the intro, with this drumsound the dum-dum-tschak doesn't have that mesmerizing, organic feeling Black Metal needs. 
One thing that bugs me with the guitars is the sound of the bridge at around 1:30. I think this needs more gain/distortion/noise to sound less plec-clickery.

"Greetings. I'm looking for some basic advice on how I can improve my metal compositions.","So I've been playing guitar for a good few years. I never practised hard enough so I certainly wouldn't call myself a technically proficient player. I pick up my guitar every now and again and what I enjoy most is trying to write riffs. However, I've always struggled combining riffs into a coherent structure to build a song around. And that's where you guys and girls come in.

What advice could you offer me to help me more easily and efficiently write better? As this is a metal subreddit I have a great desire to write some metal but what scales and modes do you think I should focus in on and how should I utilize them? What's a good method for laying down cool melodies and harmonies? And whatever else you feel is essential please feel free to elaborate on that also. I have a basic knowledge of music theory so don't hold back from using musical terminology but keep in mind my knowledge is, as I said, rather basic.

Your help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! \m/"
"Greetings. I'm looking for some basic advice on how I can improve my metal compositions.","Composition is just like being a visual artist. You must study the techniques of other artists such as Michelangelo, Dali, and Rembrandt in order to build a solid foundation, and then evolve to create your own styles and techniques which will be used to build the foundation for the next artist. If you want to be a great death metal composer, then learn the composition techniques of masters like Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, Nile, or Death and evolve from there. "
"Greetings. I'm looking for some basic advice on how I can improve my metal compositions.","Thank you for your advice, much appreciated!"
"Greetings. I'm looking for some basic advice on how I can improve my metal compositions.","Minor scales, for the most part, are pretty much the tools of the trade for metal so that's a start.  Basic knowledge of theory helps, but don't be afraid to learn more and add to an ever increasing understanding.  Lessons always help.  Kirk Hammett got lessons from Joe Satriani, and Kerry King was getting lessons from a bloke by the name of Bob Jeffers.

  Listen to bands, metal or not, where their songs get you off musically.  Listen to how they progress from one part to another, their use of time signature and tempo.  Some of my favourite changes in tempo don't really progress smoothly, they switch violently from one to another and back again with very little warning.  Think ""A world full of shit coming down"" part *Dead Embryonic Cells* by Sepultura where it goes from a medium pace, to flat out, and then back again for the next part."
"Greetings. I'm looking for some basic advice on how I can improve my metal compositions.","Thanks for your help, I appreciate it. I'm familiar with that Sepultura tune alright, so your example certainly resonated with me."
"Greetings. I'm looking for some basic advice on how I can improve my metal compositions.","Process is a fairly personal thing that everyone needs to figure out for themselves, because only you are going to know what works best for you. Experiment with different approaches and see which ones yield results. The one I run across the most is recording an improvisation, going back through the recording and picking out the good parts, and then putting those parts in a sequence.

Cohesion is often something that comes together in a full band environment. A transition that sounds jarring on just guitar can sometimes sound perfect when it's accompanied by bass and drums. Something I like to keep in mind is that you only ever have three options for ""what to do next"" when songwriting: something you've already done, something you've already done but different, or something new. 

The theoretical structures that will work for what you're writing depend on what kind of metal you're making. It's hard to go wrong with the half-whole diminished scale, which shows up frequently in thrash and death metal, but death and black metal are often completely chromatic. The harmonic minor scale is also a useful one, and in contrast to its use in classical music, it's often used melodically, even keeping the augmented second leap between the sixth and seventh degrees. Pentatonic and blues scales show up a great deal in heavy metal and all the doom/sludge/stoner metal heavily influenced by Sabbath. Phrygian shows up pretty regularly, and even Locrian here and there. Plain ol' major certainly isn't a go-to choice, but it actually shows up more often than you might think, especially in progressive and power metal.

The one thing that's pretty much universal in metal (except for power metal) is free use of tritones (especially as points of arrival), and to a lesser degree, minor seconds. No matter what else is going on melodically or harmonically, you can always throw a tritone in there."
"Greetings. I'm looking for some basic advice on how I can improve my metal compositions.","Thank you for all that, I am very grateful. Hopefully I will start applying what you and the other commenters have said and start making some progress."

Make sure you aren't cheating by missing notes, only increase the speed when you can hit every note clean, if you can't back the speed off a bit.

"Shredders of shreddit, im trying to learn how to become a shredder, how did you do it? (x-post from /r/metal)","I will second using a metronome and practicing scales. But you have to do more than that. Running up and down scales back and forth will only make you good at that shape. You need to be able to recall any interval in any key, so get good at alternate picking some weirder ones like fourth's and sixth's. Focus on clarity over speed for now. Put the metronome on something moderate and turn the gain down. When you're playing each note, pay attention to all of the qualities of the note. Is it buzzing at all? Does it extend until the end of that beat and stop only when the next note is played?  Are they all in a uniform volume?

Also don't neglect chromatic excersizes.

Do this on each string up and down, make sure your fingers are spread out but not flat, rather, curled, so that your fingers come down on top of the space where they need to be. Practice all of your exercises like that. Your scales, scale fragments, difficult passages, arpeggios (not the sweeps, you may need to be flat sometimes for that) and any other wack and crack you can think of to practice."

"Shredders of shreddit, im trying to learn how to become a shredder, how did you do it? (x-post from /r/metal)","Couple of things divided into fun and not fun categories.

Fun:

Learn a difficult song. This will usually force you to get fast and alternate picking down but with the more technical music, your left hand will get a good work out as well. I like Opeth for this. Very confusing for my left hand.

Just learn a solo and go over it with a Metronome until every note is clean. You may not be skilled enough to learn that solo, but you'll be amazed at how the practice translates into other facets of your playing.

Learn a relatively long but easy solo. This is more for getting used to doing long runs instead of a quick 2 second lick. I remember the solo from Iron Man being really good for that.

Not Fun: 

Get scales and run through them with a metronome until every note is clean. When it's clean, bump up the BPM.

Google guitar warm ups and find the warm ups that confuse your fingers. It doesn't have to sound melodic. This is all about wiring your brain to  get used to atypical patterns.

Find a repeating pattern or riff and play it over and over with a metronome. Something with alternate picking is preferred. 

*Edit: if you don't know what alternate picking is, that's really important."

"Shredders of shreddit, im trying to learn how to become a shredder, how did you do it? (x-post from /r/metal)","Come up with a lick and move it in sequence up or down modally, probably in minor to start so you can be comfortable and not as bored with just playing up and down the scale."

A lot of people will hate on technique, but realize that his style is not the 'buckethead/petrucci' style.
You will hit a wall, when it comes to speed, if your technique is wrong. 
Left hand: make sure your thumb is underneath your fingers and centered. Also, learn to use a 4 fret position. 1Index, 2middle, 3ring, 4pinky. Then learn to position shift between the 7 scale variations. Never have any fretting finger farther away from the strings than is absolutely necessary. 
Right hand: never have your fingers extended. Make the shape like you are finger picking, close the hand, And rest those fingers on the higher strings when playing E, D, or A strings. Do the reverse when playing G, B, or E strings. Rest your palm on the lower strings. 
Make sure you aren't playing with too much pick exposed, And make sure it's aligned parallel to the strings for max articulation. Pick with your elbow and not your wrist."

"Shredders of shreddit, im trying to learn how to become a shredder, how did you do it? (x-post from /r/metal)","Care to elaborate on why?
Please, go watch jeff loomis play, and see how much his entire forearm moves.  Yes, there is wrist movement.   But the driving force is the elbow. "
"Shredders of shreddit, im trying to learn how to become a shredder, how did you do it? (x-post from /r/metal)","You can still move your elbow when playing, but the actual picking motion is done with the wrist because it is a lot easier and a lot more accurate. "
"Shredders of shreddit, im trying to learn how to become a shredder, how did you do it? (x-post from /r/metal)","This is a ridiculous claim.  You use both styles when playing.  However, when full on shredding (which is what OP is alluding to) tremelo picking is used -&gt; elbow.

"Shredders of shreddit, im trying to learn how to become a shredder, how did you do it? (x-post from /r/metal)","I see. I guess I have a magic wrist then because I can play really fast without my elbow. I was always taught to use my wrist, and that is the popular belief. But if it is easier to use your elbow, then by all means use your elbow. "
"Shredders of shreddit, im trying to learn how to become a shredder, how did you do it? (x-post from /r/metal)","This is horribly wrong. It's a kind of thing you will misinterpret if you just watch someone and not feel for it. You must use your wrist to alternate pick. Carelessly fast tremolo picking can be done with the arm too, but it can be done just as well or better with the wrist."

"I'd like to share this project I'm working on... Critiques on the mix? Thanks","It's actually not bad at all! A lot better then I expected XD Great job! 

The guitars are well spaced, but it does seem like they are a bit thin in sound. That may also be due to the lack of bass frequencies from your kick and bass.

You should try experimenting with boosting some lower frequencies on your bass guitar and kick drum. It really helps fill out the center of your mix, which is sounding a bit empty.

Also have you double tracked each rhythm guitar part? If not, it's definitely worth playing around with! Record each rhythm track again so that you have 2 guitars panned left and 2 panned right, but with 1 from each track panned slightly less and at a lower volume (For exmaple, the two main rhythms are panned 100% left and right, and the 2 other rhythms are panned maybe 60% left and right and at a significantly lower volume). It will really help thicken up the mix!

Other then that great job! If you don't mind me asking, what are you running your guitars through? XD
"
"I'd like to share this project I'm working on... Critiques on the mix? Thanks","Thanks. Firstly, [here's an update](http://soundcloud.com/iuploadmymusic/yo) on the mix. Nextly, the guitar structure I have is pretty complex. The guitar chain I have is Carvin DC800 -&gt; Pod HD -&gt; Mackie Onyx (EQing out some fizz at 2.5khz) -&gt; Mbox Pro. Just looking at where the rhythm busts in, the rhythm guitars are double tracked hard panned left and right through the rest of the song. The lead is actually the same patch I just stuck a compressor between the guitar and the Pod and then putting a digital delay on the channel in the daw. The leads are the most complex part. Its a harmony of two separate notes that are quadtracked. So that means I double track one note panning the left channel hard left and the right channel about 60% then doing the opposite for the other note. Then when the second part jumps in, I have just a double track with the delay but I also have a centered track without delay to add clarity. The delay tracks add a sort of ghosting effect to the clear track. What I probably should do is take the quadtracked leads and centralize them more and take the second part and pull them out of the space that the rhythm guitars are in based on your recommendation. Every bit of advice helps so thank you. I will also try to get the lower frequencies to fill out the mix by eqing the bass and kick. "
"I'd like to share this project I'm working on... Critiques on the mix? Thanks","[Here's an update with a fuller low end and center](https://soundcloud.com/iuploadmymusic/bass-updated)"
"I'd like to share this project I'm working on... Critiques on the mix? Thanks","Very cool riffage, man! And in general it's a well structured mix. Is it Souncloud or your good self that is supplying the brick-wall limiting? You've got the 'Disturbed' effect on this track, so when the badass heavy bit kicks in, the sound actually gets quieter, leaving me feeling less satisfied that I would be if the full dynamic range was achieved and I was pinned to my back wall with nice loud brutality. So either back way way off on the threshold on your chosen limiter/compressor, or upload a significantly quieter version to Souncloud, so their built-in compression doesn't totally destroy the dynamic range of your mix."
"I'd like to share this project I'm working on... Critiques on the mix? Thanks","Thanks a lot! I didn't think I was pushing the limiter too hard until I looked in my master channel and saw a compressor had somehow found it's little old way into intercepting the signal. Dunno how that happened... Oh well, I fixed it and the heavy kicks in a lot heavier now. [Check it out](https://soundcloud.com/iuploadmymusic/asdf-1). Also I did some bass control and kicked the hell out of the kick."

"I'm putting up some tracks for a metal project I'm working on up on Soundcloud. I write, record, and produce everything. Let me know what you guys think!","I enjoyed it man. Don't take this the wrong way, but the opening riffs of Winged Messenger totally made me think of some music from MegaMan X... this is a good thing.

The playing is a bit spotty in some places, but nothing major. What tuning are you in? Sounds pretty low, I'm gunna guess somewhere around C standard? I think the singing could use a bit of work but I have a feeling you are relatively new to it.

Drums n' bass were solid. I think the drums could come up a touch. +1dB. Sometimes it's worth it to just sit with your mix and fuck tracks around by +/- even 0.1dB. A good trick (if you don't already know this) is to use group tracks to channel a bunch of related tracks down one bus. So you can funnel all your drum tracks down a single bus. Get a good drum sound going on its own, then add the rest of the tracks back in and you can adjust the level of the drums as a whole, as one volume slider, relative to the rest of the tracks. 

I like the harmonized lines as well, some pretty cool phrasing going on.

Keep it up!"
"I'm putting up some tracks for a metal project I'm working on up on Soundcloud. I write, record, and produce everything. Let me know what you guys think!","Haha I don't take the Mega Man comment as a bad thing at all man.   I've played many hours of classic games so I'm sure it pops out somewhere.  

As far as tuning I'm just tuned down a whole step, and then dropped down to C on the low string.  I agree about my vocals too, I've been singing for a while but I'm still getting used to writing with my own voice in mind.

Thanks for the advice about the mixing of the drums.   I'll definitely have to try that.  Just really difficult to get a good idea of how the mix is truly coming together without a good set of monitors.   I'm only able to mix on headphones right now.

"This is the first track i've finished of a four track demo/ep that I've been working on for entirely too long. It's about dinosaurs.","I personally like the music. It's like a chiller In Flames combined with some alternative metal. The mixing is the only thing keeping me from really loving it. The snare sounds a tad bit thin, the bass is lacking, and the vocals should really be double-tracked or duplicated. The clean layers need more compression and reverb to sit better in the mix and have a bigger sound imo. The guitar is a little thin too, so panning, compression, and eq should fix that. Also I don't know what you are planning, but if the end is like that then the next song should pick it right up. If it doesn't, then it's too sudden and anti-climactic.  
  
Now to make you feel good about yourself:  
  
The songwriting is pretty fucking awesome! It's definitely better than most of the metal I've heard on reddit. I really like the second half of the song after it chills out a bit in that it's simple but still beautiful. The playing is really solid on every instrument, and I especially want to commend the drums. Are they programmed? They sound really authentic. Also for the love of christ, tell me what you're using for a bass setup, because that tone is what I've been seeking."
"This is the first track i've finished of a four track demo/ep that I've been working on for entirely too long. It's about dinosaurs.","Thanks dude,

The song does make a little more sense in context with the other three, so stay tuned!

Drums are 100% programmed. Superior Drummer 2.0 with Metal Foundry expansion.

The bass I'm using is an Ibanez SR705. 

As far as processing I split the DI's into three separate tracks: 

* One track has everything but the lows filtered out, and that's pretty much left alone. 

* The second track has the lows, and low mids filtered out, and is run through the 'Rock Classic' model in Pod Farm 2.0 (Which is an SVT clone). 

* The third track is mostly the same as the second track except it has more of the mids filtered out and has a [bass overdrive](http://www.theserinaexperiment.net/software.html) pedal in front of the amp.

Then I buss all the tracks together and eq and compress the shit of them as usual! 

P.S.
I followed you back on soundcloud. Your shit sounds pretty awesome."
"This is the first track i've finished of a four track demo/ep that I've been working on for entirely too long.

"This is the first track i've finished of a four track demo/ep that I've been working on for entirely too long. It's about dinosaurs.","Thanks for the feedback! Balancing the low end elements is a constant struggle for me. That's something I think I'll be working on until the day I die."
"This is the first track i've finished of a four track demo/ep that I've been working on for entirely too long. It's about dinosaurs.","Seriously, muddy low ends is a struggle we all have to fight.  Making room for a thunderous kick while having a bass that is pumping can be a really difficult thing to mix.  Even harder to make it sounds *right* when mastering, without compressing the hell out of everything worth listening to. Anyway, I'm sure that people who enjoy this subgenre of metal will really dig the tunes.

"This is the first track i've finished of a four track demo/ep that I've been working on for entirely too long. It's about dinosaurs.","Amen,

Honestly, for the most part gear-wise I'm just using the plugins that come with Logic, and my shitty $150 M-AUDIO monitors.

Definitely bring that bass guitar out a bit more. I'd even say it wouldn't hurt to brighten it up a bit. Adding some more reverb to the clean guitars would be beneficial too. 

Are the mixing on the drums your own or an Andy Sneap preset? I dig them either way.

As for improving production quality, it's a new learning experience for us doing it all ourselves so the more we learn the better we get! I am also looking into buying an Avid Eleven Rack which comes with Pro Tools 11 which should also be a major help as we are currently using Reaper. In this recording, a friend recorded us on his Axe FX 2 but we were very limited on time so this is the product of about 5 minutes of playing with the tone and 3-4 hours of recording. And thank you for the tip, we will definitely make a bandcamp! We just made the reverbnation because it syncs with facebook and made it easier to share with friends.

"We are a fairly new band from Aurora, CO and just released an instrumental version of our first song. Let us know what you think! (Cross post from /r/metal)","Bandcamp also integrates with Facebook.  Having used both bandcamp &amp; reverbnation, I can assure you that reverbnation offers very little that bandcamp can't.    

I know that recording everything yourself sounds appealing, but a professional recording goes a very long way.  My advice would be to hone your chops live as much as possible &amp; book some studio time with a legit engineer.  Dave Otero runs Flatline Audio (look him up) in northwest Denver, and he's made tons of amazing metal records, including stuff by Cephalic Carnage and Cattle Decapitation to name a few. Don't worry about having the right vocal gear to gig-  every legit venue in Denver that hosts metal has a PA.  For a practice setup, a cheap option is to purchase a keyboard amp with an XLR output jack, and just sing into that.  My band is on our 3rd record at this point, and we still use this cheap-ass setup for practice, so don't fool yourself into thinking you need to invest thousands in a soundboard just to practice with a singer.

Overall, I really like the composition. It could use a bit more in the way of dynamics, it's kind of always on 11 but that's cool too. It's a fast fist-pumper. Good job. Love to hear with bass and vox."
"I've been writing/recording/rewriting this song since I started playing guitar, almost 4 years now. Any critiques so far?","It took so long just because I was never satisfied with how it sounded until now. But, thanks for listening! 

I plan on adding bass and vocals ASAP. I really think it'll shine then. "

"Functional Significance of Tone in Black Metal guitar","Follow up to my last vid on [Black Metal riffs](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalmusicians/comments/2lxlso/deconstructing_the_2_note_riff_in_black_metal/)

Shoutouts to /u/therascalking for [suggesting](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalmusicians/comments/2lxlso/deconstructing_the_2_note_riff_in_black_metal/clzl8bt)/reminding me to include a bit on tone.

It's a long vid and a lot of it is me rambling (yawn), but the meat of the vid comes up near the end of the video (around 9 minutes). To quote the description for anyone short on time:

&gt;For most styles of music, guitar tone serves an aesthetic role. You choose your tone based on what sounds good to you. But in black metal, tone plays an important functional role.

&gt;Low frequencies have a side effect of muffling the harmonic contrast between the notes in a chord (10:22). This effect increases with playing speed, and thick, bassy tones are rarely ever found in black metal music for this reason.

&gt;While high treble tone helps define the raw, black metal atmosphere, it also serves the functional purpose of increasing the harmonic contrast between the notes in a tremolo picked riff.
"
"Functional Significance of Tone in Black Metal guitar","you make good videos dude; engaging, and clear enough descriptions without too much over-simplification "
"Functional Significance of Tone in Black Metal guitar","Hey, thanks a lot man. My experience is that too many people focus on showing others how to do things instead of teaching, I think they're afraid of going too deep because they don't want to leave anyone out.

I would prefer if people were more engaged, that way everyone gets something out of it. Even with my few ""Riff Lessons"" (I'm about to add a couple more), it's less about showing people how to play a song, which anyone can drill on their own, but more about demonstrating ideas which hopefully leads to learning and playing songs efficiently. Mostly importantly - train your ear so you don't have to rely on tabs. 

I'm going off on a tangent but when I get worked up on something it's hard to stop thinking about it. There's a video on that coming soon for sure.

Anyway, I'm glad it's not too convoluted. This one was done over two days so it's long and I'm still worried it drags on because I repeat the same things over and over (of course there's a positive thing too). It's still a learning experience doing these, and I'm glad I get to improve on organizing my own thoughts in a presentable manner. "
"Functional Significance of Tone in Black Metal guitar","no the repetition is good, it is a huge part of teaching/learning. even with some of the parts that many guitar players may already know--stuff like pick-up selection vs. guitar tone, which is something i have known for ever, it's a nice refresher...just hearing someone else reinforce what you already know, even if it's simple, helps some of the new information stick"
"Functional Significance of Tone in Black Metal guitar","Hey man, these videos are great! I've hit a terrible block in connecting the music theory with my own writing and your videos have been helping clear it all up in a style that is extremely relevant to mine. Thanks so much! "

If there's anything specific you want to discuss let me know, cause I don't have a plan for these videos, I just pick something I feel like talking about when I have the time.

"Just had another quarter inch cable die on me... [xpost from /r/guitar]","Any tips on preventing this? Brands to look for/avoid? I try to take care of my gear but obviously I'm doing something wrong."
"Just had another quarter inch cable die on me... [xpost from /r/guitar]","Learn to solder. The part that breaks most is the soldered connection of the wire to the plug. Resoldering the connection solves 95% of the issues I have with my cables. The rest of the time it's a bent plug or cut wire which need replacement.

Edit: Forgot a cable recommendation. Cables similar to [these](http://www.amazon.com/Hosa-Cable-GTR205R-Guitar-Right/dp/B0018R6AGM/ref=sr_1_4?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407626683&amp;sr=1-4) will allow you to unscrew the plug connection cover so you can get in there and resolder it."
"Just had another quarter inch cable die on me... [xpost from /r/guitar]","Except they always fucking unscrew when you don't want them to &gt;:("
"Just had another quarter inch cable die on me... [xpost from /r/guitar]","Plumber's tape on threads. Picked that one up from a pro roadie."
"Just had another quarter inch cable die on me... [xpost from /r/guitar]","Gaff tape will also work for this. Just don't use duct tape as it leaves a LOT of adhesive behind and rots faster than many other kinds of tape."
"Just had another quarter inch cable die on me... [xpost from /r/guitar]","This is my recommendation as well. The point just after the solder on the wire in any connector is the weakest part of any cable. Since you didn't mention a broken tip or anything like that my best guess is that the wire disconnected from the end. You can double check this by unscrewing the shell of the connector and looking at the solder points."
"Just had another quarter inch cable die on me... [xpost from /r/guitar]","  Break down and throw a little more money at them.  Not only do cheap cables have shitty solder jobs with weak to no bracing to protect them if they get tugged or bent or something, but they also have shitty quality copper wires that degrade your signal.  On average you lose ~1dB of gain for every 10 feet of cable.  In other words, they eat your tone.  I solder my own cables out of high quality components, and they lose  ~1/4dB for every 25 feet or so, and I can beat the hell out of them to my heart's content and they will not fail.  Interested in some, you can PM me.
  Otherwise look for something with a lifetime guarantee.  Monster cables are pretty good quality, and guaranteed for life.  I've had 2 of them go bad on me in the past, you just take them to Guitar Center and tell them it's broken and they'll just hand you a new one.  That's not a bad deal.  Just DO NOT get the ones with the gold jacks.  Its a marketing ploy.  The 1/4 inch jacks are capped with a little bit of gold, which makes them slightly bigger than 1/4 inch and will over time ruin the input jack of the things you're plugging them into."
"Just had another quarter inch cable die on me... [xpost from /r/guitar]","Just for clarification for people, gold plated connectors(like you are talking about) are a ploy. True solid gold pins/connectors are certainly not a marketing ploy."

"Looking for Collaboration","I'm a guitarist looking to collaborate with other musicians, specifically guitarists and drummers.  I've been playing guitar for about 10-11 years now, and have kind of hit a patch of writer's block.  I was thinking of bouncing some riff/melody ideas off of other guitarists and seeing if we could come up with anything together.  My style is generally melodeath, with some black/doom and slight prog influences as well.  Think In Flames(all), Amon Amarth, Swallow the Sun, etc.  If there's any interest, post here or send a PM.  I'll be uploading some of what I've done to soundcloud here in a little while.

Anyway, I can play and record drums if you can supply guitars with a click track. :) "
"Looking for Collaboration","Sounds good.  I use Reaper, so I can just insert the metronome that I use myself.  Would that work?  I'm going to try and dial in the tone, see if Reaper has any mastering features(I just started using it), and hopefully get some better quality recordings within the next few days.  "
"Looking for Collaboration","Cool. I use Reaper as well. Yea, you can just make an mp3 with the metronome enabled. If you want to make one with, and one without, the click, I can send back the drums with the clickless guitars. Or I can send just the drums and you can mix the guitars in. Whatever works for you. "
"Looking for Collaboration","If you use reaper, we can just send the files back and forth, no?"

"Practicing without a microphone. (X-Post r/Screaming)","Hey everyone, new subscriber here but not new to the world of screaming. I've been screaming for about 1.5 years and I always had a mic until recently. My question to you guys is, is it necessary to have a microphone or does it help? I've noticed that it fucking sucks but is there any advantages to having or not having one? Also, my highs fucking suck. Any and all tips would be helpful. I'm about to watch the Zen of Screaming videos but I heard they aren't that great.
"
"Practicing without a microphone. (X-Post r/Screaming)","It isn't necessary, just like with any other form of vocalization. You can get the added bonus of being able to get different dynamics depending on how you're screaming into the mic, and fine tune it, but you get to work on tone and the raw quality of your screams without it. Practicing with a mic is ultimately just personal preference. As for your highs, in my experience highs are difficult to attain without A. alcohol (the numbness increases risk of damage though) B. warming up and relaxing your vocal chords and throat (Tea works wonders) or C. shit loads of regular practice. I've had friends who could do highs no problem, but not lows, and vice verse. A lot of how high or low I can scream depends on if I tuck my chin against my chest or if I look up and stretch my neck out all the way."
"Practicing without a microphone. (X-Post r/Screaming)","It could have a psychological effect. Having the mic might add the motivation to go all out since you're ""live"""

"Anyone interested in being a session bassist or session drummer for my technical death metal band?","Hello, everyone. I play guitar and vocals in a technical death metal band called Cruelty Exalted. We are based out of Los Angeles and are currently in the process of recording a 3 song EP. We've recorded the guitar tracks for about 2 songs and drum tracks for 1 so far, but we still have a lot of work that has yet to be completed and we've been having trouble finding musicians that can commit to completely finishing this EP. I'm currently working with a drummer, but he's been experiencing a lot of technical issues and hasn't been able to spend much time on this project due to his job. Furthermore, the bass players that I know personally have been extremely busy with their own bands or haven't shown much commitment in participating. In other words, I'm technically the only permanent member save for my friend whom I'm recording guitar and vocal tracks with (although he's not really a member of the band per se).
Potential bass players must be able to have all the typical death metal chops such as speed, accuracy, the ability to sweep and tremolo pick, etc. The ability to write creative bass lines is also a strong plus. While not necessarily required, finger-style is strongly preferred over pick-playing.
Similarly, potential drummers must be able to have all of the typical death metal chops such as being able to play blastbeats, use double bass pedals, create unique and interesting beats and fills, be able to play at very high speeds (at or around 250 BPM is a solid estimate, just for the sake of argument), and pretty much everything else you'd expect of a death metal drummer with regards to technique and creativity.
This applies to both instruments: It is also imperative that recording equipment is readily available to you, either by borrowing it through a friend, owning it yourself, going to a studio, or any other legal method of accessing such materials. Owning Guitar Pro, Power Tab, Tux Guitar, or any other variation of such a program is strongly advised. We will definitely be exchanging a lot of files, so be sure to check your e-mail, Facebook, Reddit, etc. often in case we're in an exceptionally busy stage in the recording process. In those instances, prompt responses to messages are absolutely necessary. I can't afford to not hear from you for months at a time if you decide to be a part of this band from the get-go (a musician I used to work with wouldn't respond to his messages for weeks or months at a time, so that's why I'm particularly stringent about slow responses. Obviously I won't be upset if you don't get back to me for a day or a two as long as you explain that you were busy with something else, but it isn't fair to me or the others if you're slow to respond or give results for excessively long periods of time).
Let me know if you'd be interested in being a part of this project either by commenting on this post or sending me a private message. Please include a video or audio clip of your drum or bass playing and I'll get back to you as soon as I can once I've found a proper candidate for the job. Serious inquiries only, please. I'd like think that I'm easy to work with overall, but I'm looking for the very best musicians I can possibly find, so a professional attitude and work ethic are imperative for this project.

Our newer material sounds a lot more death/thrash influenced (but groovier) since we had a drummer change and everyone mostly grew out of the metalcore phase. Regardless, thanks for the listen! "
"My band's first demo is now up on Soundcloud. Enjoy!","My band, Dissentience, put out our first demo earlier this year on [our Bandcamp](https://dissentience.bandcamp.com), but we just made it available on Soundcloud. We're originally from Bethlehem, PA and basically fresh out of high school. Our influences are all over the place, but we've been called blackened death metal before. We're working on a second demo now (writing only so far, but sounding awesome!) which should be out sometime early-mid next year. If you like the demo, give us a like on [our Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dissentienceband)!"
"Learning Guitar - New","So, I am fairly new to guitar.

I have got down some basics like basic power chords and stuff.

I learned the intro to Skeletons of Society by Slayer and got that down decently.

I am decent at reading tabs, but I need some advice on how to get better, and what my next step should be in terms of getting better at playing quicker, and being able to move my fingers quicker when changing chords.

I have a Washburn X series guitar incase anybody is wondering.

Any suggestions? :)"
"Learning Guitar - New","Couple of things divided into fun and less fun categories.

Fun:

Learn a difficult song. This will usually force you to practice tremelo, galloping, down and alternate picking. With the more technical music, your left hand will get a good work out as well. I like Opeth for this. Very confusing for my left hand.

Just learn a solo and go over it with a Metronome until every note is clean. You may not be skilled enough to learn that solo, but you'll be amazed at how the practice translates into other facets of your playing.

Learn a relatively long but easy solo. This is more for getting used to doing long runs instead of a quick 2 second lick. I remember the solo from Iron Man being really good for that.

Record or find a backing track on YouTube and just solo over it. Make it a goal to do one new thing a day. It probably won't be a good new thing most of the time, but every now and then you will accidentally stumble on something fantastic. (This also helps with rhythm and quick thinking)


Not as Fun: 

Find scales/arpeggios  and run through them with a metronome until every note is clean. When it's clean, bump up the BPM.

Google guitar warm ups and find the warm ups that confuse your fingers. It doesn't have to sound melodic. This is all about wiring your brain to get used to atypical patterns.

Find a repeating pattern or riff and play it over and over with a metronome. Something with alternate picking is preferred. 

Edit* as a rule of thumb, if I can do something three times in a row, that's when I'm ready to move on. Also this is just stuff that I did that helped me out. Didn't mean to sound preachy or anything
"
"Learning Guitar - New","Practice, practice, practice!

Practice with a metronome; start the pieces you are practicing on a low speed and *don't* increase the speed until you can do it dead on.

Practice scales--start with major and minor scales and modes of the major scale. If you get those down, you can work on harmonic and melodic minor scales, and their associated modes. You can also find different dexterity drills that just work out your fingers but can't really translate to actual songs. Again, practice with a metronome, and don't increase the speed of a scale or drill until you have it down at the speed you're currently working on.

Be a stickler for the basics. Use alternate picking, and *be strict about it*. There are other picking styles, but learn the basics first. Trust me, it's hard to go back and learn alternate picking once you have some chops under your belt. Make sure you position your hands properly (thumb should be on the back of the neck--many guitarists [myself included] don't use this technique all the time, but it really helps to have it as your foundation) and **use your pinky!**

It cannot be overstated how helpful it is to have a qualified instructor to give you lessons, as well. Above all, what I guess I'm saying is don't skimp on the fundamentals and take it slow. Don't take the quick and easy path; learn to break out of your comfort zone--that's the only way to learn."
"Learning Guitar - New","Yeah, I have began to learn a few of the scales like the E Minor pentatonic scale for example. I find them very fun to play. Especially when I switch between scales half way just to like mess around."
"Learning Guitar - New","You know that the scales have the same intervals in every key, right?"
"Learning Guitar - New","It's real Simple: Just play the guitar and have fun.  The more you progress from playing the more you will want to challenge yourself.  Learn the music of bands you like as it will not only be practice but also help teach you to create your own material plus provide general music theory knowledge.  have fun!!

"I've been working on my production quality a lot lately and this song is my first practical use of what I've been learning. Let me know what you think!","I think it sounds pretty good, the composition is really good. Only thing I might change would be the guitar tone. It could use some fattening up, right now it feels sorta weak. It's all midrange. Everything else sounds good to me."
"I've been working on my production quality a lot lately and this song is my first practical use of what I've been learning. Let me know what you think!","I am going to have to disagree. I find the distorted guitar tone to be fine (unless my speakers are adding a lot of bass or something), however, I found some sections of the song to be repeditive, the riffs themselves weren't bad they were just repeated a few too many times for my liking. I would also work on the drums as well, the beats were a little too sparse in places, making the song sound kinda empty at times. Overall though the mix is pretty good."
"I've been working on my production quality a lot lately and this song is my first practical use of what I've been learning. Let me know what you think!","Really? I was pretty pleased with the drums for this one. That said, I've kinda always been very utilitarian about how I write them so they've always been a bit tough for me. What could I have done differently?"
"I've been working on my production quality a lot lately and this song is my first practical use of what I've been learning. Let me know what you think!","I just think they need more variety in places, take the first riff that comes in around 30 seconds, the drum beat is good it goes with the music and has some nice cymbal skips, but it uses the exact same beat the whole time the riff plays, no fills or variations. In my opinion when doing instrumental music you should strive to keep the listeners interest by having movement in some part of the music at all times, so while the guitar may play the same riff over and over the drums can elaborate on the initial beat with some fills and variations. This creates movement and direction which can build energy and allow for better transitions between sections. 

Another side note with the drums is if you want them to sound more realistic you need to add some randomization to the velocity of the drums hits, it makes them sound more natural. To add realistic dynamics you make the drum hit on the down beat slightly harder than the offbeats, it helps to create a more natural pulse. The difference does not have to be much and you may NOT want to do this with the kickdrum, but it makes a big difference for fills and cymbal hits"
"I've been working on my production quality a lot lately and this song is my first practical use of what I've been learning. Let me know what you think!","Good stuff man, I'll keep that in mind when I'm working on drums in the future. Thanks!"
"I've been working on my production quality a lot lately and this song is my first practical use of what I've been learning. Let me know what you think!","Thanks! Yeah the guitars are always a work in progress for me. Most of the saturated, mid-heavy sound comes from the two line-in tracks. This was my first time recording two guitar tracks with my amp as well, so once I nail the mic placement for that hopefully I can eliminate the line-in stuff and get that beefier, fuller sound to my guitar tracks."
"I've been working on my production quality a lot lately and this song is my first practical use of what I've been learning. Let me know what you think!","Yeah, aside from that tiny detail, there's some seriously awesome stuff on your soundcloud for sure! All the songs have a really great flow to them, which I definitely struggle with in my own writing. They all seem to be pretty dynamic."

Let me know what you think!","I don't know how to put it..... but something feels like it's missing from this. It might be that you need more layers? I guess it just doesn't sound massive enough?

By all means it's a good track though, I guess it's missing a tiny oomph to me."

"Track from Upcoming Sludge/Core/Doom Demo - (Solo / All Instruments / Mix&amp;Master)","Hello friends,

If you have some time go ahead and sentence yourself to four minutes of sludging despair.  All instruments, vocals, and production was done by me in my ""new studio.""

[Listen on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/thurisazm/waking-to-the-nightmare)

This was kind of an experiment before I go record the rest of the songs on the demo (a faster d-beat core song, a doom-sludge song, and a few songs combining those).

Here is the recording equipment I used (hence the pathetic drum sound):

* Drums --
&gt;  1x AT2020 USB mic over the drumset  
&gt;  1x SM57 mic in the kick drum  

* Guitar -- (Blackstar tube distortion pedal into a Peavey Powered EQ, Peavey Booster, Peavey Power Amp, into a 1x15+1x4 / 4x10+1x4 / 4x10+2x3)  
&gt;  1x AT2020 USB mic in center of room  
&gt;  1x SM57 mic on the Sunn Model 3 cabs, a few inches from the speaker cone  

* Bass -- (Same as guitar setup, no Blackstar pedal)  
&gt;  1x SM57 mic on the 1x15, a few inches from the speaker cone  
  
* Vocals --
&gt;  Had my roommates lock me in the recording closet.  Vodka + SM57 + a sock  

* Production --
&gt;  Audacity  
&gt;  FLStudio 11 Producer Edition.  Both mics recorded simultaneously and independently (finally).  

*The next songs should be a significant improvement: More mics on the drums, more drum equipment (non-shitty cymbals), Sunn amp head, streamlined recording process.*  
  
Known issues with this mix:  
* Drum impacts do not cut through  
* Cymbals are super bright and obvious  
* Some unwanted low-frequency mud on the guitar  
* Bass doesn't quite punch in the face yet  
* Shoddy slicing/transition between riffs at the end"

"Looking for some mixing and mastering advice","So my old band recorded a song before breaking up: we did it with zero cost, recording drums by assembling two electronic drum sets together, one of which was borrowed for free, and recording guitar, bass and vocals at our respective homes. I used Studio One 2 for tracking and mixing, Superior Drummer as a drum machine, Studio One 2's built-in Ampire as an amp sim, and Revalver for cab simulation.

We didn't get to actually finish recording everything: there are some backing vocals missing, the bass is really just a guitar track transposed an octave down (a placeholder until I could record bass), and the guitar solo was recorded with our lead guitarist's amp instead of via direct-in.

Content warning, it's a power metal song.
https://soundcloud.com/niexs/the-new-sunrise

In my opinion it sounds kinda alright, but listening to it after listening to properly produced tracks is jarring. It sounds very cold and abrasive, which really doesn't fit power metal.

So do y'all have any suggestions? Any general or specific advice for remixing this? Presets to share, guides to read, anything?

Thanks in advance."
"Looking for some mixing and mastering advice","Do you have the original stems from the project?

If you were going to pursue the modern 'big' metal sound, there is a lot that could be changed:

Adding real bass guitar would fill the void in the low/mid range.
(even if you don't have the stems, tracking a real bass and blending it in would help)

Layering a couple more guitar tracks will thicken it up quite a bit.
Perhaps tracking / hard panning two identical guitar performances that follow the bass lines.   

Don't want to / can't do any re-tracking? I would start with compression. As you know, modern metal is compressed into oblivion.

I've found that dialing in compression levels / EQ is easiest when I sit in my car with my laptop. My car is where I listen to music and that is where everyone else is going to be hearing it as well.

"What strings do you guys use?","D'addario. I tried a few different kinds early on, but playing in a thrash band takes its toll quick on strings. I've never had one fail that wasn't a direct result of a shitty bridge. Most of the cheaper metal stop rails (and Chinese saddle parts for the Floyd) would create ruts that eventually cut the strings. Once I figure that out, I knew that I was working with prime strings after a set of elixers broke during the second practice. "

As for myself, I use D'Addario XLs. I tried a number of different strings when I started playing, and like these the best. The reason is clarity. I feel like they deliver great tone from whatever bass I'm playing on any string, anywhere on the neck. They also stay in tune pretty well, and hold a great tone for several months.

My main axe is a Warwick six string thumb bass in standard tuning. The low B is nice and deep, and the high C is nice and clear. I get good note definition even with distortion. I also get lots of psychedelic harmonics when I add in my effects pedals.

"How do vocalists like John Gallagher and Muhammad Suiçmez hit those low guttural growls?","A lot of it has to do with how you shape the sound with your mouth. The way you hold your jaw, tongue, lips, and soft palate combined with the amount of support from your diaphragm will allow you to change your sound. The easiest way to get an idea of all this is to practice your vowels (a e i o u). As each sound forms naturally in your mouth, try to hold that shape as you say other words. For example, I tend to go with an ""o"" shape for my standard growls, an ""i"" shape for my higher screams, and an ""e"" shape for the gutterals."
"How do vocalists like John Gallagher and Muhammad Suiçmez hit those low guttural growls?","for me, its all about sticking out the lower jaw as much as possible, making a small hole with my mouth, and putting my tongue on various parts of the roof of my mouth. 

your tongue position combined with the mouth shape causes your voice to sort of echo inside and make the growls sound deeper.


of course i already have a very deep voice, and i cannot do highs like some of my favorite vocalists can. 


now that i think about it some more, ive found different positioning of my head also alters the sound quite a bit. chest out, chin basically on my chest and ive got the lowest i can go.

So this has definitely turned into a much longer thing than I had originally anticipated. Once I got started working on the second part, posted below, I decided that I didn't want this analysis to spill over to a third post, and at some point I would cut-off the riff-by-riff analysis, take a look at how the song ends, and post what I've got. There are a few reasons for that. One, by this point, most of the techniques and concepts that characterize the song have already been introduced and established. That's just a natural result of good songwriting; if Schaffer was constantly introducing new harmonic concepts, the music would lose cohesion and sound like a sequence of unrelated stuff. Two, I have enough information to draw some conclusions about the song as a whole. And three, I think spilling over to a third post would strain my attention span and that of my audience. There's lot's of metal out there that I want to look at and I'm eager to get to the next thing. And the more of these I do, the more connections I'll be able to draw between them.

Again, please let me know if you've enjoyed this and want me to do more, or if you have any questions or thoughts. Also feel free to post requests for the next song for me to look at. I'll probably go with whatever one gets the most upvotes. If, along with your request, you post a question or something about that song you'd like me to look at specifically, so much the better.

So here's the remainder of the riff-by-riff, followed by my conclusions (in the comments) about how this song is structure and what makes it work musically.



We left off at 5:24. They've switched to clean guitar tones, and a reduction in tempo. There's an Eb minor arpeggio repeating four times before a chord progression comes in along with the vocals. Chord progression (with chords changing every two bars) is Ebm | Gb9/Db | Cbmaj7no3 | Ebm, which is i-bIII-bVI-i, which is a series of tonics and tonic substitutes (in terms of harmonic function, chords built on the third and sixth degree of the scale are considered variations on, or substitutes for, the tonic chord). The last chord has a phrygian lick at the end. Vocals are following the fifths, except on the last chord, where they move to Eb. Cool thing is that the bass moves down by whole steps and then jumps down (along with the vocals) a minor sixth to the last Eb, which sounds particularly doomy. Halfway through, they add another acoustic guitar arpeggiation an octave above the first, following the same chord progression but with a 3:2 rhythm that resolves after two bars. Strangely, the second guitar is playing the second chord as a Db major, leading to a possible reinterpretation of the first chord as Db6sus4. With the second guitar, it could be interpreted perhaps as Db6add4? Third chord for the second guitar is B, which fits within the established harmonic framework, and then it follows the Eb Phrygian lick. 

Key change! Only the second one since the introduction. Now we're in F# minor (which we're using instead of Gb minor, which is a theoretical key with nine flats that is never used in practice). Diatonic modulation to F# from Eb would indicated F# *major*, but the riff (another quasi-polyrhythmic gallop riff) uses a lick that goes from the fifth to the minor sixth, indicating a minor mode. So we've got a chromatic thirds relationship to the original key, a tonal shift which is mostly found in impressionist music and modal jazz. It's also interesting to note that Schaffer effectively exhausted the modal possibilities for Eb and then returned to Phrygian before blasting off to another key. Then we've got another Metallica-esque sliding power chord riff, following an F# minor melody, and implying the chord progression, i-ii-i-iv-bIII. 

Then we've got a twin guitar harmony lead over the rhythm guitar. One guitar is following the root movement, and the second is harmonizing in diatonic thirds. Very Iron Maiden. Aside from octaves, thirds are probably the most popular choice for harmonizing a melody.  The resulting sound tends to be epic and majestic. This is a diatonic harmonization, which means that the harmonized line uses both major and minor thirds to stay within the F# minor mode. A chromatic harmonization (such as was used at the end of the introduction) would use all minor or all major thirds, freely playing notes outside of the mode. 

Next riff is similar, another sliding power chord riff, this time using harmonic minor with the leading tone. Since Schaffer is using an unaltered power chord, with a perfect fifth over the leading tone, rather than the diminished fifth that would normally appear there, this is a good illustration of exactly what power chords are. They're not chords in the traditional sense because they don't have any inherent directionality, and they're not constructed from a modal framework the way major and minor chords are. Rather, they're a means of beefing up a single-note line through chromatic harmonization in parallel fifths.

Next we've got chanting vocals following the bass line, F# to F natural. That's a trope that Iced Earth has used in a few other places, such as ""Damien"" on Horror Show. I believe it shows up quite a bit elsewhere in the metal world, but I can't think of any examples from other bands offhand. Guitar riff in minor; still no thirds, but it's got minor sixths. This time, the exchange is facilitated by the riff playing a *real* (as opposed to *tonal*) sequence. Similar concept to what I was talking about above with diatonic and chromatic harmonization. A sequence is just a transposition of a melody, repeating it at a higher or lower pitch. Rather than transposing the riff along the harmonic minor scale, they're just moving the entire thing without transposing any of the intervals (the F natural part of the sequence uses a C natural, which is not in the key of F# minor). This also means that they're tonicizing the leading tone during that part of the sequence, temporarily turning it into the tonally-central note. 

8:43 brings a reduction in tempo and a significant shift of rhythmic texture. Bass is playing a transposition of the tonic/leading tone movement in the last section, this time C# to C natural, so now we're in C# minor. The rhythm guitar is playing inverted (fifth in the bass) C# power chords and the lead guitar is playing a melody note over the chords that moves from A (minor sixth, minor ninth above the bass) to G#. When the bass shifts to C natural, the melody notes transpose as well with a rhythmic alteration: the perfect fifth is coming on the strong beat and the minor sixth on the weak beat. This creates a cool little tonally chromatic melody (it's tonal relative to the chords it's playing over, but chromatic as a line), which is joined by another lead guitar doubling an octave above, which then harmonizes the melody at the 12th. 

Next riff is a rhythmic variation on that melody and harmonic progression with half-spoken vocals. And that puts us up to 9:45. 

The first thing that struck me about the next section was how harmonically unstable it sounds. We're about 2/3 of the way through, which is a good place (as per the golden ratio, which is shows up a lot in music) for a more harmonically unstable section, since that creates tension, which is a good thing to have when you're building up to some sort of climax. The rhythm guitar is playing a melody on inverted power chords, B-Db-Bb three times, and then that plus an Eb. That inverted power chord--a chord with a root and a fifth, and the fifth in the bass--has shown up in a few other places throughout this song. Any chord with a fifth in the bass is going to be somewhat unstable, since the perfect fourth formed by the bass and the root is, functionally speaking, a dissonance. Unlike the previous sections, here the bass guitar is doubling the fifth of each chord rather than the root, which amplifies that instability. Also, the first chord of this section is a tritone away from the last chord of the previous section, which I think prevents this section from ""inheriting"" the tonality of the previous section. Despite the harmonic instability, the first three bars seem to imply Bb, and then in the last bar everyone's plays the Eb in unison so that's not so much implied as stated explicitly, which means this section is both creating tension in anticipation of a climax and leading us back to Eb as the tonic. 

Next section is clean, back in Eb land. Just a little transition to establish the tonality before things kick into high gear. Of note, this lick has both the minor second of Phrygian and the major second of Aeolian (the natural minor scale), although never on top of each other, so this is a good example of how to implement chromatic color tones in a very tonal way. When the distortion kicks in, the riff mostly follows the same pattern as the last one, using  the Phrygian minor seconds throughout and the Aeolian major seconds at the end.

At 10:49, we've got a riff that starts in Eb minor and then jumps to A natural, a tritone leap.  And since nothing else is going on that would indicate that it's derived from diminished or Locrian harmony, this is just one of those free tritones that makes metal sound like metal. One might think of these sorts of tritones, as they appear throughout metal, as being derived from the blues, which also tends to throw tritones around rather freely. Difference is, the blues tend to use tritones as chromatic passing notes, while metal tends to just hang out on the tritone (as we see here) or even (as in the case of the opening riff of ""Black Sabbath"") use it as a point of arrival."
"Metal Theory #1, pt. 2: Iced Earth - Dante's Inferno (x-post from r/metal)","(continued from post)

So this is where I'm fast forwarding a bit. They're definitely building up to the climactic section of the song, with some of the fastest riffing heard so far, but for the most part it's new content generated from the concepts that have appeared earlier in the song. We've got some Db Phrygian, and when the vocals come back in, B harmonic minor, and then back to Eb Phrygian. The part from 13:36 to 14:38 has some tonal ambiguity, which builds tension into what I consider to be the climax of the piece (""Lucifer! Angel of Light!""), a straightforward, heavy-ass Eb Phrygian riff. And that tone space is largely how they wrap up the song, with some tritones thrown in for good measure and a rhythmic buildup over a fade out.  

Conclusions: The main driving force of ""Dante's Inferno"" is modal progression, which is a very elegant solution to the problems involved in creating a long-form heavy metal song. Staying in a single key space and modality for 16 minutes would be extremely monotonous, but changing key would also require changing bass, which would mean that the guitarists wouldn't have the same access to that ultra-heavy sound created by riffing on the open sixth string. By having the song progress modally, with different scales centered tonally on Eb, they get the variety necessary to carry the song forward without losing access to that low Eb. Specifically, we've got natural minor, harmonic minor, Phrygian, Locrian, diminished, and chromatic. Later on in the song, once the various modal possibilities of Eb have been explored, they allow themselves to move away from that, creating tone spaces that contrast with the Eb heaviness, increasing the impact when they land back on it at the end of the song. 

The other interesting thing to look at is the form of the song. It's through-composed, which means that there are no repeating sections, as there would be in a more traditional verse-chorus structure. There are ideas that get repeated within their own sections, but at no point does the song return to ideas that were used earlier. Through-composition is the structure of choice for the tone poem, the genre of orchestral music that gained prominence in the late Romantic period. The most widely known is probably Strauss's ""Also sprach Zarathustra,"" the opening of which served as the theme for the movie 2001. A tone poem is a musical setting of some sort of extra-musical concept, usually a poem or story or some other narrative. Although tone poems are strictly instrumental, given the form and the subject matter, ""Dante's Inferno"" is effectively a heavy metal tone poem. "

I have some suggestions:

Branch out from harmonic analysis and get some rhythmic and lyrical stuff in there... and if you do... maybe pick shorter songs to make the work load manageable.

Look at the connection between lyric and composition... your findings there will be a great discussion point as they will be much more opinion based than the 'matter of fact' analysis you have done so far.

Perhaps try some different formatting ideas... having a paragraph per riff as you have is a good idea but maybe start each paragraph with a few bullet points of key information... like key changes, chords, tempo... followed by your more detailed descriptions.... this just makes it easier to pick out key points while listening to the track... it wasn't really a problem with this track but faster songs would be a pain in the ass to keep up with.

Some diagrams wouldn't hurt!  Notation and tab would make some ideas much easier to convey.

"Metal Theory #1, pt. 2: Iced Earth - Dante's Inferno (x-post from r/metal)","Thanks! And thanks for posting the link to the song. Forgot to do that on this one.

Excellent suggestions. I'd definitely like to focus on other aspects than just harmony in future analyses. That just seemed like the best way to approach this particular song. And I'm certainly going to change up the formatting. In retrospect, I don't think the riff-by-riff approach works especially well, both from a readability and comprehensibility standpoint. It's thorough, but I end up repeating myself a lot (""Here's an Eb Phrygian riff... and another one... and another one...""), and while it's interesting, it doesn't add much to the overall understanding of the song relative to the amount of time spent on it. My plan for the future is to hone in on maybe 1-3 interesting aspects of the music from the get-go, and highlight parts of the music that exemplify that. I might still use the bullet point approach to deliver some general structural information, if I think that would be necessary or helpful. 

I'll definitely bring in some notation for the next one. I might look into the lyrics a little bit more, but lyrics just aren't something I connect with in most music, and understanding or analyzing them definitely wouldn't be my strong point. That might be a good place for the subreddit communities to pick up the slack in the comments section.

And thanks for the suggestion. Serpentine Path is one of those albums I checked out, listen to, really enjoyed, and haven't been back to since. That would give me a good excuse to get re-acquainted with it."

"Mixing 2 Guitar and Bass Tones","Hope you can help,



I record metal, which requires multiple guitars. However, when I record my rhythm and lead, the product doesn't sound together. For example, in a professional song, you can't really tell the two guitars apart 100% of the time. However, when I record, the guitars sound too separated and they don't mix well into one overall sound. Even the bass sounds distant/separated from the mix.




I play to a metronome, use the same tones, combine the tracks, put it in the leveler to direct where each guitar goes in the speaker, mess with tracks on my recording software, and they still sound too separate. It's not my playing either, I'm on-time but the guitars don't sound together/mixed well. I hope you know what I mean.




Are there any tips/tricks/methods to recording multiple guitars so that they form a powerful overall sound instead of all separate? Any advice would be gratefully appreciated."

"Let's Talk Bass, Week II: Gear!","Welcome back to Let's Talk Bass. I'll try and keep this a weekly thing as much as I can.

[Link to Week I: The Bassics, for those who missed it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalmusicians/comments/1ygkgk/lets_talk_bass_week_i_the_bassics/)

So, as promised, this week we're going to talk about gear. I'm splitting this up into four major parts: **Bass Guitars**, **Amps**, **Strings**, and **Effects**. So, let's rock and roll.

**BASS GUITARS**

There's a running gag on [Talkbass](http://www.talkbass.com) (which you should totally go to, by the way) that goes simply ""What's the best bass for metal?"" This is because there have been a lot of threads on there about this precise topic. And that's because there is no best bass for metal. Just about every major bass manufacturer has had one of their basses used successfully for metal at some point. Most likely a first bass will be a Precision or Jazz styled bass, so I'm going to cover those, the MusicMan Stingray for its popularity with the modern metal crowd, and a few others.

The **Fender Precision Bass** was the first mass-produced bass guitar, and is frequently considered *the* bass for its distinctive low-mid-focussed sound. The P entered metal right from the get-go with Geezer Butler's use of the instrument on pretty much all of the ""classic"" Sabbath albums (which is to say the first six). [Here is the isolated bass of ""After Forever"", off Sabbath's third LP *Master of Reality*.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6iUdK1ngiQ)

Another famous metal P-bassist was Steve Harris of Iron Maiden. [Here is the isolated bass from ""The Trooper,"" off Maiden's fourth LP *Piece of Mind.*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSYuse9o8KI) As you can hear, the P has a distinctive tone, but it can fit a variety of situations depending on your technique.

The **Fender Jazz Bass** was originally marketed as Fender's ""deluxe model"" bass, with two pickups and a thinner neck designed to appeal to discerning jazz musicians. It didn't catch on in regular jazz, but did in fusion, and also in rock and metal. Geddy Lee of Rush has used a ""J-bass"" on all of Rush's records since 1993's *Counterparts*, and used it intermittently on *Permanent Waves*, *Moving Pictures*, and *Signals*. [Hear it here on ""Tom Sawyer,"" from the *Moving Pictures* record.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSYuse9o8KI) Just with this, the differences between the P and the J are evident: The J has a much more ""forward"" tone naturally, which Geddy enhances with heavy amp drive.

Another famous user of the J-bass, this time in a more ""metal"" context, is Greg Christian, formerly of Testament. [Hear him play on ""Practice What You Preach,"" off the record of the same name.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHOJVINZVR0) The J bass's forwardness comes from the pickup close to the bridge, which I think he is soloing (that is, playing with only that pickup on) for this extremely nasal sound.

One more Jazz Bass player: [Tim Commerford, of Rage Against the Machine.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nw3gzAnBiA)

These are going to be your most likely first choice for a bass. They are the most-copied bass types in the world, and by and large the difference between brands is a matter of construction quality rather than anything very different about the sound. Fender's ""Standard"" lines, made in Baja California, are generally of good quality for a good price. Squier's ""Vintage Modified"" basses are also very good quality for the price. These basses can also be found in 5-string configurations.

The **MusicMan Stingray** is, while most likely out of the average starting bassist's price range, an excellent bass, and very common in modern metal for its cutting tone. This comes from the bass's single pickup, which is closer to the bridge than the P pickup, and the active preamp in the bass. This allows you to increase or decrease the amount of high end, low end, or midrange in your sound with knobs on the bass. I personally don't use them much, but the tone is perfectly serviceable at flat. [Here is Johnny Christ of Avenged Sevenfold using a Stingray (might be a Sterling, its smaller cousin) on the track ""Afterlife,"" from the *City of Evil* record.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nw3gzAnBiA) If you can afford a Stingray, I highly recommend it. Unlike the Fenders, I wouldn't recommend going to MusicMan's budget line, as they sacrifice electronics for price, and the active electronics are a big part of the MM sound.

The **Rickenbacker 4001/3** is another classic instrument, associated with prog as much as with metal thanks to the likes of Chris Squire and Geddy Lee. The two most famous users of the Rickenbacker in metal are Cliff Burton and Lemmy, who scarcely need introduction. The Rickenbacker's popularity is due to a number of factors, but primarily the consistently high quality of the basses, their distinctive appearance, and the even-more-distinctive sound, with tons of treble and midrange. Not likely to be a beginner bass, however, due to the high price tag. Also, unlike the aforementioned basses, they do not come in 5 strings.

I would like to recommend against basses with so-called [""soapbar"" pickups,](http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u279/splatbass/Instruments/Icon6web.jpg), at least for a first bass, as the electronics behind the active electronics in the lower-end basses can be lousy, requiring replacement to sound good. Plus, I personally find them hard to fit into a mix with a guitar (my personal experience, YMMV).

A word about 5-string basses and other ""extended-range"" basses: There is nothing wrong with them. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. 5 strings allow for a much greater range in playing lines that don't exactly follow the guitar (which we'll cover later), and also preclude a need to drop-tune. However, make sure the low B on the bass is of satisfactory quality. Low-priced 5-string basses have awful low B strings. Once again, Squier has a 5-string Jazz bass in its Vintage Modified series, and its low B is generally excellent.

I will talk about fretless basses later, as they have particular things to note.

**AMPLIFIERS**

Now, here's where it gets *really* fun, and by fun I mean confusing. The basics of amplification are thus: You need a lot of wattage to be heard on stage with distorted guitar(s) and drums. Generally over 100 watts. But you don't need that to practice, especially on your own. For solo practice, a small combo amp does well. I recommend Peavey. For a ""gigging rig,"" you generally need a head and a cab.

The head is the ""business part"" of the amplifier, which, generally speaking, is where you do most of the tone shaping. Good brands for metal bass heads include Ampeg, Fender, Hartke, Peavey, and Gallien-Krueger. Stay away from Acoustic and Behringer; they have issues with construction that will result in you spending more money in the long run. Don't worry about tubes: solid-state amps are easier to maintain, lighter, and cheaper. You may want a tube amp later, but solid-state will serve you well, especially early on.

Cabs are the speakers. The gold standard of these is the Ampeg 810 (8 speakers measuring 10 inches), which has been imitated by nearly every other company. The same companies as above are good cab makers. First cab, you probably want to look at a 410 (4 10-inch speakers) instead of the 810. You could also look at a 2x12 cab, or even a 1x15, but the 4x10 will be more efficient at moving air. However, 12-inch and 15-inch speakers have their own characteristics that may be useful.

**Note:** I advise you to turn the tweeter off in whatever cab you get. It is not needed, and distortion with a tweeter can be highly unpleasant.

**STRINGS**

Strings have a bigger impact on your tone and your technique than you might realize. Different strings sound different depending on the *material* and the *construction*. Strings can be divided broadly by these two categories.

In terms of construction, you have *roundwound* and *flatwound* strings. Rounds are overwhelmingly the most common type of string used, particularly in metal, due to the rich, often ringing tone. However, many bassists swear by flatwounds for their thick fundamental and smooth feel. Steve Harris uses flatwounds, for instance. Granted he changes them after every show and generally gets a more roundwound-like tone out of them through his technique and amps, but still.

In terms of material, you generally have *steel* and *nickel* strings. Steels are brighter than nickels, and in my opinion they have a better sound after the ""new"" sound wears off. However, steels are much tenser and much rougher on your fingers than nickels.

Good string brands include Rotosound, D'Addario, Dunlop, DR, and SIT. [This website](http://www.bassstringsonline.com/) is by far the best place to get strings of those brands and more, many more than you could get at a local shop. And for less.

**EFFECTS**

There are a shit ton of effects out there. You don't need much more than a tuner, and possibly a compressor, which will make your tone sound more even dynamically. However, this is metal. You probably want distortion

Well, be careful about distortion. Most if not all guitar distortion pedals suffer from severe low-end loss and scoop your midrange, meaning your distorted sound will blend with the guitars and disappear in the mix, which will then sound hollow and sloppy. Look for distortions with clean blending options (Boss ODB-3) or derivatives of the Ibanez Tube Screamer (in addition to that, the Digitech Bad Monkey is a surprisingly good choice), which feature strong midrange boosts.

If you want only a few effects to experiment with, take the advice of Racer X/The Mars Volta bassist and effects addict Juan Alderete, who recommends fuzz, phaser, and octaver (bass octaver), as those will all show up in the FOH and can be used for many different situations.

I'm Unfortunately out of characters, so I'm ending here. Thanks for reading. Next time: Writing basslines!"

"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","I have the same problem. I used to turn up to what would be drop A, and just not play in open.   But I got smart and strung a 4 string baritone, which works much better. "
"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","woah. that's smart. 
it must be a cunt to play though"
"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","Tune your 8 string down a half step and tune your bass up a half step. They'll line up nicely.

F Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Bb Eb &lt;= 8-string

F Bb Eb Ab &lt;= 4-string bass

Alternatively you could just tune your 8-string down a whole step and leave the bass in standard.
"
"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","What tuning do the guitarists play in? If it's anything lower than F#, I'd tune your bass in unison instead of an octave down. An interesting mod you can do to help thicken your tone and be more up-front in the mix, is to add a second output jack, and run one output with some light overdrive or distortion, and run both outputs into your rig. You can also use a signal splitter into two rigs if you don't want to mod your bass."
"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","In all honestly, I typically tune basses up from E to F#. But I'm just a guitarist..."
"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","[deleted]"
"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","Depends on how you want to do it. I'd just tune the bass down a whole step for extra low notes. And find the low notes of the guitar on what would now be my D string. If you want to tune really low like the guitar, get a bass with a longer scale to increase tension."
"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","Match your 8 on the top 4, drop the fifth. Example: F# standard, tune your bass to B#F#B#EA so you can go down an octave under the 7th string but you can match on the F#. For Drop E on an 8, just go in BEADG. I hope this helps"
"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","Tell your guitarist to stop it. 8 strings is silly. "
"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","It's really not, it can definitely broaden your range if you can adapt to the extra strings as well as know at least some basic theory and scales/modes"
"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","This. If TechDeath or metalcore, just leave the band. If Progressive, get a sixer and leave it in standard. 

Remember, guitars work exactly like basses do in extended ranges. Both of you can keep standard tuning, and it'll sound just fine. 

Shit, I have a 5006E in E (EADGCf#) to accompany my girlfriend's standard six MLX. Sounds amazin' when harmonized. "
"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","i'm not asking for wisdom on the virtues of different genres, i just want to know what tunings are usually employed. meshuggah seem to get on just fine with a 5."
"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","They also play open and 1 a lot, being djent. 

Which in that case, you're just playing percussion. Who cares about tuning after that. Just overdrive it, fuzz it up, distort it, compress it, and rob it of all the treble possible. "

I'm sure everyone is waiting on bated breath. "
"how da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?","If your problem is the low string why would you spend so much money to get a bass with the same tuning but with an extra higher string. Why not get a longer scale neck and put it on your current bass. Or if you're not into that FIND THE NOTES ON YOUR FRETBOARD!!!! Seriously so many of these comments telling you to tune up?! You know you don't have to play the same frets as the guitarist as a matter of fact you don't need to play the same part as the guitarist. I say either stay in standard or tune a whole step down. You don't need extra strings or to tune up. Just find the notes on the bass!!! Sorry for making this so long and mean sounding but I really just wanted to get my point across since it seems that everyone else is giving the same bad idea."

"How do I achieve the doom/black/Prog metal keyboard sound with vsts?","I wanted to add a backing track with synth to give the song I'm working on some more ambient and epic sounding. I guess that's the best way to describe it.

I just don't really know how to achieve that kind of synth choir / string ensemble sound. Comparing to songs like [Cosmic Keys To My Creations And Times by Emperor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzBCmrk2oIw), [Through her silvery body by Swallow the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWciyO2sID4), [Rising Force by Yngwie Malmsteen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB9DHFUIrbA), or my personal favorite [Cosmosgenesis by Gru](http://youtu.be/ygiq6AMBGko?t=23m27s).

I just have a simple midi keyboard interface ([Edirol PCR-50](http://www.roland.com/products/en/PCR-50/)), so I assume whatever I need to get this to work would be a VST or some virtual instrument. I'm using ableton and I've been spending some time just going through the default sounds it comes with, but nothing seems to fit or even come close. I just wanted to know if anyone could give me some tips or point me in the direction to some info about achieving this kind of sound because I'm pretty lost and I can't seem to find anything on the subject."
"How do I achieve the doom/black/Prog metal keyboard sound with vsts?","Usually you can just layer a synth choir and a string sound. ;) These guys probably are using a preset on whatever particular keyboards they play, so it might be worth watching the videos to find out, then looking for a VSTi simulation of that instrument.

Failing that, if you get a decent 3rd party synth there is almost always some preset that will do exactly what you need - either as-is, or with 2 sounds layered - because synth string/choir is a very obvious and common patch. I like the Native Instruments VSTs when searching for specific sounds because you can filter the presets by criteria such as 'Bowed Strings' and 'Vocal' which cuts down the time you spend looking.

If I want something realistic sounding, I use the choir patches in Symphonic Orchestra or Symphonic Choirs. Same for strings.

Here's a free choir VSTi that I occasionally use if I'm not after realism: http://www.dskmusic.com/dsk-choirz/

As for synth strings, I use Massive, Absynth, or one of the various synths that come with Sonar."

"Demonoxic - Teen Distorted Freaks (my band's first demo recording)","The groove of the song makes me wish this was more of an anthem.  I like the riff, but I think the main riff needs to be fuller, using power chords on the guitar instead of single notes.  The vocals also need work, they sound too quiet and breathy.

I would pick up the tempo a bit, and layer lots of shouting on the ""WE ARE TEEN DISTORTED, TEEN DISTORTED FREEEEAKS!""  that should be the line that kicks off the pit.  Make the song loud and raucous."
"Demonoxic - Teen Distorted Freaks (my band's first demo recording)","thanks, I'll be sure to try these things out"
"Demonoxic - Teen Distorted Freaks (my band's first demo recording)","I rarely listen to metal. Not to say that I don't like it. The vocalist sounds like he's dealing with a phlegm issue. From the metal I've heard it's supposed to be growling and deep. I don't know if that's what you guys are going for. You guys should probably have your vocalist see a specialist to know if he isn't going to sacrifice his voice before you guys get to an album. There's an up and down side to this: he may, physiologically, never be able to growl in a way that's satisfying because growling isn't really special, just like pop singing you have to be within a certain range to do it; or he has vocal chords that can take a beating. I'm a novice but maybe once he has the fear of going deeper into the growl conquered he'll sound less like an actual teen."

I don't usually think about it, but honestly my process is kind of all over the place from song to song. 

I usually start out with a collection of random riffs that I liked enough to jot down in Guitar Pro at some point, and I'll either develop them individually or try and come up with creative ways of piecing them together. Usually by means dicking around with a guitar until I like what comes out, adding drum and bass parts along the way.

Once I feel like I have a full songs worth of material I record it, and then often end up completely rewriting certain parts if they don't sound as cool in real life as I thought they did in Guitar Pro."

I have this amp(bought it for myself for Xmas) with a TS-9 tube screamer and this amp fucking rips but it's noisy as shit. I put a ISP Decimator in line and a bullshit Behringer noise suppressor in the loop to get it quiet. I'll be upgrading the behringer for a Boss NS-2 in the near future. But, yes, this amp is as noisey as the reviews say it is... But it sounds fucking dope. "
"Any way to get a good metalcore tone for under $500?","I have the NS-2 doing the 4-cable method and it is very good... I'd look at getting rid of both the ISP and the behringer and getting the ISP Decimator G String and using that with the 4-cabe method if I were you"
"Any way to get a good metalcore tone for under $500?","That's a good idea now that I've played with the stuff personally instead of watching YouTube reviews. I got the Decimator last weekend at Guitar Center. The guy told me that they don't stock the G-String and it would have to be special ordered(why would I do that when I could order it online without going to them?) and that the Decimator by itself would suffice. For some of the reviewers, it seemed like it worked well but this won't cut it for me. My stupid ass didn't even realize that the NS-2 had a 4 cable method until you brought it up. None of the videos I watched featured that and I'm thoroughly hating myself for it.

Do you have experience with the G String? The NS-2 is $100 and the Decimator was $140 meanwhile the G String is $240. Is the G String worth the extra cash? I've read that instead of it acting as two independent gates, it times the gate in the loop to the input signal for more accuracy. Maybe the NS-2 does that as well?"
"Any way to get a good metalcore tone for under $500?","I've seen the G string on ebay new for $160-180 before, and cheaper second hand. The NS-2 will fit your needs perfectly however it does affect your tone a bit (I like the way it does, slightly compresses and tightens it). The NS-2 works very well as a gate (good for chugging), where the ISP is better for reducing hiss without touching your sound too much.

As I said I use the NS-2 and I'm very happy... I moved on from my 5150 though and have an AXE FX 2 now with internal gates so never upgraded to the ISP. I have used the G string with my amp in the past when I borrowed it off another guitarist and didn't notice a huge difference to be honest. Also you should be able to pick up an NS-2 online much cheaper than $100"

The good: 

I love chromatic felling in metal, it has a sense of progress, of foreboding.

The bad:

I can tell you that you only play down strokes, and you're recording with some microphone, like a computer mic?  It really sounds like you're practicing and grooving, noodling, not a song.  Also, you're not keeping time.  Try playing with some time keeping device, or patting your feet.

Anyway, I think you made me listen to your practice session.  I don't know what that does for me or you or anyone.  Record things within some kind of time signature, with some sort of feeling of key - besides 1 chord/note.

"[Post black/Drone] My friend and I just put out a split! Feedback?","Hey guys!
My friend and I just put out a split, and it's up for free download/streaming on our respective bandcamps. My half (post-black) is [here](http://vacantsea.bandcamp.com/), and his half (noisy drone/ambient) is [here](http://weepingkneeling.bandcamp.com/)!

We'll be putting out a few tapes for cheap when I get around to it on my  ""DIY label"" (aka self-releasing them) (so if you want one, pm me and I'll message you when I finally get my shit together!)

I would LOVE any feedback on mixing, etc. on my side and if anyone would check it out it would mean a lot. I'll pass comments on to him too if you have any. 

I put a lot of time into these two tracks and trying to make them sound a lot better than the shitty demos I've put out, but I know I have a very long way to go!

"Microphones for harsh vox?","My SM57 for guitars is thus far the only mic I own. IT sounds really muddy on my harsh vocals, and as such I'd like to get a microphone better suited for the purpose. I would liketo stay under 200$ if possible."
"Microphones for harsh vox?","SM57s work GREAT for harsh metal vocals, you may just be too close to the microphone. when your playing a show and you need to be that close thats fine, but in the studio (bedroom, basement, whatever) you need some distance between the sound source and the micrphone.

id put your face about a foot away from the mic, maybe a smidge further, imagine theres a giant gout of fire pouring out of your mouth, Looks like a giant lighter, you want the microphone to be in the tip of that flame"
"Microphones for harsh vox?","This! I have recorded harsh vocals with an SM57 and it has sounded pretty awesome (http://mothmanofficial.bandcamp.com/track/the-cleansing if you want to check it out. Although we ran it through a heavy load of pedals and a guitar amp for extra wtf haha)

That said, condenser mics are what you want if you would like even more clarity. Just put it through a solid compressor and you should get a much cleaner tone. The other songs on the link I put up were recorded through a condenser mic as opposed to a dynamic if you want to check it out."
"Microphones for harsh vox?","If you're getting a load of mud from the 57, try moving it further away. If you've got it about 4 to 6 inches away, with a popshield in between you and the mic, that should do the trick. 

The 57's a favourite of mine on aggressive vocals, but if you do want to try something else (and you have phantom power available), the Audio Technica AT2020 is a damn fine mic for the price."
"Microphones for harsh vox?","sm7b"
"Microphones for harsh vox?","+1 to the SM7B"
"Microphones for harsh vox?","I'm an amateur, so take my advice for what its worth. I use the [MXL V67](http://www.amazon.com/MXL-Large-Capsule-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000JRPYGE) for vocals. It's a relatively cheap condenser with a cardioid input pattern. It has a darker tone compared to similar mics (so i read), but for the most part I've haven't notice it enough to be a concern. In any case, i would look into condenser mics in general. "
"Microphones for harsh vox?","I use this one too. Way better than you'd expect for $100, certainly worth the investment as your next mic if you only own a SM57. I use it for vocals and also get great room sounds for drums."
"Microphones for harsh vox?","I've had great results with an Electrovoice RE20/PL20 (same microphone rebranded, I forget from which to which), which you might be able to find used within your budget.

I've also had great results with an AKG C414 XLS, but that will most definitely be out of your price range - perhaps a more affordable alternative might be the SE Electronics se4400, which is very similar but not quite as bright; I've used it in place of the 414 before, just not on vocals.

I've also heard people have quite good results with a Shure SM7B, which I've yet to try myself, but it's a broadcast microphone along the same lines as the PL/RE20, and again, might be within your budget used."
"Microphones for harsh vox?","do what Consider Phlebas said. edit: it'll provide better results than if you weren't doing it. If the vocals sound very muddy then in the EQ (I assume you're screaming) you want to cut out some of the bass frequencies and boost the upper mids and lower highs that'll retain the sharp/harsh/howly edge and cut out some of the mud. "
"Microphones for harsh vox?","I've been using a SM58 (the same one) for about 12 years now. I've used the 57 and they are good but the 58 is just that much better in my opinion. The last recording I did we used a Beta58 and I'm more than impressed with it also. A brand new SM58 will run you around a hundred bucks."

"This is the opening track from the new album I'm working on. Suntelia Aeon - The Astronaut (Between The End and The Beginning). Hope you enjoy it!","In terms of song writing and overall structure this is pretty sweet, I think the drums still need a little work in order to sound realistic though. During some of the softer parts the bass drum is pounding way too hard imo, and while it works with the heavier sections, it messes up the delicate atmosphere of the quiter parts. I would also try randomizing the velocity on the drum hits as well, as it can give them a less robotic feel. Overall though, good work. Drums are a pain in the ass to get right, and I feel like half the comments I see in these threads relate to the mixing of the drums, but you already have a good drum track musically, and that's the hardest part, so without too much work it should be sounding even better.  Excited to hear the rest of the album."

"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","Also chug a few beers."
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","Get comfortable palm muting most passages, while lifting for a few accented notes. Also, alternate picking is a must. For a melodic sound, stay in minor keys. For the more aggressive sound, you need to use more dissonant scales, such as Phrygian or octatonic, but don't be afraid to make power chords based off notes in these scales even if they don't fit."
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","Thanks, I will learn/attempt to learn some of that."

"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","It's also called a diminished scale. It alternates between whole and half steps."
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","Ahh okay, thanks. :)"
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","Whole-half or half-whole alternates as such. Diminished is a step and a half (3 frets) between each interval. It's fun to play the diminished runs that occur in other scales, such as harmonic minor."
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","Half step down. Get your picking hand used to doing some intense down picking (Hetfield is a fucking god at this) "
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","Been practicing down picking a while, I'm alright, but not like Jaymz."
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","Practice everyday. Even if it's only for 5 minutes."
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","I might be able to give you a few tips. I've only been playing guitar for about a year and a half (started at the ripe age of 26), but thrash/crossover are what I practice/play/write; pretty much the reason I started playing in the first place.

A good way to understand thrash and speed metal is to download some of the tablature and use guitar pro to slow down the bpm. As mentioned by others in here, alternate picking and down picking are both important. The challenge is more in figuring out when to use them, which comes in time and as you get more comfortable with the riff styles of thrash.

A real good start, also would be to check out some Power Metal, like Iron Maiden, etc. because it's more often than not slower than the 200+bpm crossover genre.

All that being said, here are a few tips:

* Almost all thrash/crossover is played in E-standard tuning. Some guitarists might tune down half a step to Eb standard to make themselves pop out a bit more from the rest of the band, but for the most part E standard is where it's at (Ninja Edit: Except for [Vektor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZeltyIhaw0), who plays in F-standard and they are incredible).

* Spend just as much time on your picking hand technique and rhythm as you do on fretboard logic/theory. In Thrash, there really isn't a lot of notes that ring out beyond a quarter note more than once or twice in a row, simply because much of what thrash contains is guitars that play every beat of the rhythm in the band, which is actually much different than the majority of other music in the world in which guitar is almost an accent to the rest of the band. This leads into my next point.

* Rhythm is much more important than a slew of notes all over the neck when you're learning how to play thrash/speed metal. If you look back at old Exodus or Testament, some of their greatest riffs were astonishingly simple but have the fucking *groove* to it. Just a reminder: Rhythm is severely important, so get used to just playing to a metronome or backing track, all eighth notes for a few measures, all 16th notes the next couple measures, then 32nd notes, then 16th notes, and then back to eighths. Practice that type of rhythm exercise and put in a few notes here and there. This all goes toward establishing an internal metronome for yourself and it's tremendously rewarding when you start to enjoy the rhythms you come up with.

* Toxic Holocaust is a great band and they are a great example of something that I am still very much working on which is: String skipping; being able to play rhythm whilst interweaving single notes, hammer-ons/pull-offs, from other strings right in the middle of your low E rhythm chugging. It provides accent outside of the groove that you are running on the low string(s).

* Learning a few scales is important - as already mentioned - but don't get stuck in them. Minor/Harmonic Minor scales are used quite frequently, but there is an abundance of chromatic note sequences throughout thrash (if you're not familiar, chromatic meaning does not fit within a convention western scale). It's fucking awesome and can make for some incredibly unique riffs.

* Last but definitely not least: Power Chords. You already know power chords are used, but what needs to be established is that there are a tremendous amount of power chord slides, palm muted power chords, single low-E notes amidst quick power chord shift on other strings. Get very familiar with the feeling of a power chord, use that as the basis to explore altered power chords, like those with raised 5ths, etc.

I am by no means pretending to be an expert. I have so much to learn, just like you. I just got a bit of a head start. Hopefully some of this helps.

"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","Holy shit, thanks."
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","Start slow with riffs and practice tricky parts at half speed. Only increase speed when you nail the lick. "
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","Practice everything slow with a metronome. Alternate picking sounds like crap when you don't have the rhythm right. Inverted power chords are also really cool. Megadeth uses them a lot"
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","Coffee."
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","I have heard that 4th chords can give the illusion of a lower tuning or just be a bit thicker when you need it. Otherwise, scoop your mids and cut a little bass, get that really good shitty distorted sound, and alternate pick some power chords. "
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","What is a 4th chord?"
"Tips for playing Thrash metal on guitar?","Same fret on 2 strings, so like the low E and low A at the same time, or maybe 2 notes up an F# and a B."
"How do you people write lyrics?","I figured I could write out lyrics without any real music behind it. I would write out a super rough copy is a basic format then after the all the other tracks are completed, I could ""re-rock"" my lyrics into fitting with the song. I've been told this is completely wrong and you can't really do it.. That doesn't make sense to me. What's your style and plan of attack when writing brutal lyrics? "
"How do you people write lyrics?","So I've got this bassist friend and we spend a lot of time at his house making up songs on the spot about stupid stupid shit(hating cunts, found a pizza, why's that pigeon got no feet?). then the other day we started blasting out this fantastic power metal because we just got used to making things slightly coherent in a short space of time. 

Our logic was you just answer questions that are asked between each line, like ""in a distant place"" yeah what's in a distant place? ""where dwells castles and dragons"" Ok, and are they good ""the most evil beasts around"" And do people tolerate this? ""Well no, they bury their faces in ale filled flagons or cower under ground."" and then both go ""WHEYYYYY IT FIT!"" NEXT LINE!

At least with cheesy metal you can literally say anything as long as it's somewhat relevant. 

For something a bit more brutal, you could easily follow 36 Crazyfists lead and just sing angry things and waheohahow your way into making them fit.

"How do you people write lyrics?","In the end, having fun is all that matters. haha. "
"How do you people write lyrics?","I either write things to the rhythm of whatever has been recorded or start off with kind of poetry kind of shit and just tweak it as the flow of the music shapes things.

  ""completely wrong and you can't really do it""?  Fuck that noise man!  If it fucking works for you then it fucking works.  The creative process is different for everyone man, so don't let some know-it-all twat tell you that what your doing is ""wrong"".  Some people can write a song completely using sheet music and theory, other people jam it out, more again sit down and work out bits and pieces by recording riffs and stitching them together later, so I don't see why this shouldn't apply to lyrics."
"How do you people write lyrics?","I come up with a story and I try to ""figure out"" how to tell the story in the best way possible. I have a rough version of what I want to say and then I keep trying to rephrase it in a way that's poetic - imagery and wordplay are very important to me. Finally, I try to go nuts with rhyming without being dependent on pure end rhyme, which I believe makes lyrics cheesy and predictable while also limiting creative potential.

Here's a sample from one of my songs, [Obsidian Heart.](http://apathybm.bandcamp.com/track/obsidian-heart-demo)

&gt;Forged in the heart of the *crater*   
The *creator* looks in **dismay**   
Casts **away** the **mistake**   
To be **erased** from memory by   
*Time*   
As it passes *by*   
Drenched by the **tears** of the Earth  
The **seared** *flesh* turns to *ash*  
As the life begins to end  

I've alternated highlighting the rhyming with italics and bold.

The story is about cooling lava which turns from red hot like blood to cold and black obsidian, hence the title. The second part of the verse is my favorite part of the song because of how well it describes what is going on while maintaining complex rhyme. The ""tears"" turn the laval into ""seared flesh"" which looks like ""ash"".

I do think lyrics tend to ""come"" to me, like I'm discovering them rather then piecing them together, but I might just be crazy."

"How do you people write lyrics?","For me it helped to just write about a topic first in a stream of consciousness type of thing, then rearrange it until it fits a melody. I leave the text alone though once I'm finished, so that it looks more like a paragraph set to music, rather than specifically lyrics. Example:

For A Dying Man:

&gt;If I should I find him once more, cowering and naked alone, tormented and cold, I will fulfil his final request. He was soaked in his blood, and his filth and sweat, when he told me how he became sick and hungry, and chose to die alone in the street. No comfort, no life. Only pain in perpetual night. 
&gt;
&gt;I have abandoned a soul to his doom, and witnessed the ending of a brother’s life. I watched him die, but not for a cause. I will only be perpetuating complacency until I live the day where it’s my turn to suffocate on my own blood, in the last of my days.


Basically try and view stuff like this:


&gt;Imagine the moment that you will die

&gt;Awaiting your travels beyond

&gt;Wishing its repugnance restores and tames

&gt;your tortured soooouuuuul

"How do you people write lyrics?","Usually I go humming with what I want the vocals to sound like

after that, I make up words instead. Random, but something to fit with the tone that the song reminds me of. 

Then I get the idea of what I want the lyrics to be about, either like a short story or a poem. After that its just repeating the chorus, and adding verses, and then a few fillers here and there.

good luck"

For learning metal as a whole, A lot of people start with Judas Priest. Mostly everything from British Steel is a piece of cake. Living After Midnight is practically a power chord and timing exercise, and speaking of which, you should understand the importance of exercises as much as learning riffs. Get into the habit of **using a metronome** and counting to four with everything. Take your time and play just one scale and riff pattern a day you find difficult really slowly so that your goal is to hear each note ring out clearly and fluidly instead of at breakneck speeds. I'll list some more suggestions including some of my favorite easy to play songs.

.


Motorhead - Killed By Death, Over the Top, I'll Be Your Sister

Judas Priest - Breaking The Law, Grinder, You've Got Another Thing Coming, Take These Chains

Black Sabbath - I, After All, Paranoid, Symptom of the Universe, Neon Knights

Venom - Welcome to Hell, In League with Satan, Schizo, Warhead (this one is super fun and easy!)

Entombed - Say it in Slugs

Church of Misery - Badlands

Darkthrone - Quintessence

Celtic Frost - Dethroned Emperor, Jewel Throne, Os Abysmi Vel Daath, Progeny

Most everything by Saint Vitus, and most doom bands for that matter. Reverend Bizarre. Candlemass can have some tricky stuff but look at their late 90's albums."

"I'm new to playing the guitar. What are some easy metal riffs to learn? How did you start to learn? (x-post)","Good suggestions in this thread already, and I see someone recommended Metallica's black album in the other thread. If you like AC/DC, they'll help you get some basic open chords down (or alternatively Priest's ""Living After Midnight"" like UltimateSasquatch suggested). Once you've gotten one down, the rest will come easily because the same handful of chords are so common. Whatever you start with, don't try the whole song at once; work on one riff at a time, get it clean, and piece them together later, perhaps focusing on getting the transitions clean.  

For working on speedy, syncopated riffs, older Metallica riffs in ""Disposable Heroes"" and ""One"" are good exercises. (I'm not recommending either of those songs in their entirety as beginner material, but they include single-note speed-picked riffs that will let you focus on your picking hand without worrying about fret-hand stuff.)  

When you want to try a lead, consider giving some old Black Sabbath a shot. The solo in ""Paranoid"" is pretty easy and will help familiarize you with the pentatonic scale."

You might wanna increase the lows, though. This is just me, but I feel like the tone is just a little bit too treble-y. It'd be pretty cool if you were to EQ it such that you have a bit more bass in there."

I dont get the hate for pod farm. They got good stuff. Sure there are better, but I just like pod farm's amps for some reason more than guitar rig or amplitube. 

nice riffage tho"

"
"How is my tone? Advise to improve? :)","I also just want to say, the 2nd one loses all of it's power. Makes the whole thing sound weaker and much more like fake amp sims. That first tone in near perfect though. Very well done. "
"How is my tone? Advise to improve? :)","Superior "
"How is my tone? Advise to improve? :)","I like the first one better, second I think has more potential though, but you need to give both tones some bottom end. It's really trebley. I'd also advice you to dial just a tad back on the distortion. Line 6's amp emulation has a habit of sounding very digital once you add too much distortion.

Also, a bit more compressor wouldn't hurt. :)"
"How is my tone? Advise to improve? :)","Yeah it does sound very digital, I've dialed the distortion pretty far back already, but I could try more. The aim was to get more mid range to make the tone sound more full so it probably brought out the digital aspect a bit more. Thanks :)"

Instead, I went with something that sounded off. It's not for everyone, but some people really liked it because it was so different."
"So where would I start learning how to write metal?","I've been dying to write and record my own music for a long time, and now that I'm actually sitting down and trying to come up with stuff, I'm realizing I'm fucking *awful* at writing metal of any sort. I mean, I tried writing simple djent and deathcore songs just to sort of get the bare bones of making riffs and melodies, and I couldn't even do that. I'm trying to write an atmospheric black metal album that's pretty melody driven. What I'm doing is fairly unique, I guess, but the closest thing I could compare it to is Lustre. I just can't come up with a single damn melody no matter how hard I try. What's even more frustrating is that I always get little melodies in my head that I like, but I never can get them figured out on guitar or piano, and I always end up losing them. I was hoping you guys would have some pointers, because I have absolutely no idea what to do or where to start."
"So where would I start learning how to write metal?","My personal songwriting journey went from: 1) learning the basics of the guitar, to 2) playing a lot of covers and building a 'metal library' in my head, to 3) creating riffs by messing around and drawing from my metal library, to 4) being able to write specific things that fit within a premeditated vision. 


When I hear people talk about songwriting (and in metal, it's usually really *riff* writing), they'll often suggest looking into music theory. To me, theory becomes more helpful later in one's journey when you begin to be restricted by what you can do; I don't think it's important at the beginning stages.


The only thing I can say is **keep writing**. Songwriting is something you *do* rather than something you learn. You can learn to play other people's songs, but you can't really learn from others about how to tap into your own creative process. It really is trial and error.


The most practical advice I can give you is: first, analyze what works in songs you like (pay attention to how the instruments are interacting with each other; what changes are there in tempo/feel throughout the song; is the song in the same key the whole time? etc...). Second, listen to a bunch of music you like from which you'll draw inspiration. Don't *learn* these songs but try to mimic something about them; that is, think about what you want to play and translate that into your fingers. Finally, just go with what feels natural to you and be patient. For the longest time I could only seemingly write decent clean guitar parts, and then for a while after that I suddenly could crank out heavy riffs but no clean ones. 


Your ability to create will come and go, so just keep working on it and be prepared to capture the good moments when they arise. Good luck!"
"So where would I start learning how to write metal?","Buy a bottle of whiskey and a copy of INRI."
"So where would I start learning how to write metal?","What's your experience with learning your instruments?  All self-taught, have you had lessons?  Never be afraid of seeking lessons, because the more knowledge of music you have, the more tricks you have to pull out of the bag.  Learning my guitar scales for example made me see the patterns of notes and it opened the fretboard right up for me.  I could finally see and could identify what key my favourite metal solos were in (or at least most likely in), and knowing this you'll get a better idea of what notes will sound good together.

  Teachers can give you ideas you'd never have thought of yourself and can also correct mistakes in your technique you didn't know you were making.  If you go researching you'll find that there are plenty of big name acts who's members have gone and got lessons, if not regularly, than at least time to time eg. Kerry King of Slayer.  "
"So where would I start learning how to write metal?","As far as getting melodies and retaining them, I find the best way to do it is record yourself humming or singing the melody on your phone or anything with a sound recorder, and attempting to transcribe it at a later date. The app Evernote is a godsend for me as it syncs across your phone, computer, tablet, whatever it's installed on. "
"So where would I start learning how to write metal?","How much do you know about chord construction and harmonies? That's pretty much essential in putting together any sort of black metal since the genre is driven by harmonies."
"So where would I start learning how to write metal?","you say you'd like to make an 'ambient black metal' project. thing about that genre, is that it's much more based in orchestral music than rock and roll. djent is a very different style of music, as it's more than anything based on rhythmic complexities. 

atmospheric black metal is often about tonality and contrapuntal motion. these concepts aren't things most people just jump into. one of my favorite bands, krallice, do this stuff really well. listen to [this track](http://youtu.be/CVGrJUDNM9s) and try to notice how the two guitars and bass are all playing similar melodic lines, but they are tonically complimentary. mick barr and colin marsten are classically trained musicians and write based on these fairly complex theories. [which is why i love them so much.]

so, this music is less about 'riffs' and more about understanding what kind of dissonance and resonance you want to achieve with all the parts. now, you don't necessarily have to learn music theory to do these things. if you listen to enough music, you can train yourself to understand these concepts instinctually. i think most technical metal bands are these sort of 'instinctual' players. so the truth is, if you can't do it where you are now, you should either start learning music theory or listen to a lot of really complex compositions and try to glean what you can out of them. maybe do both. listen to a lot of bach and froberger. in the end, write what feels good. not everyone can write complex music, but everyone can try. and who knows, maybe you'll come up with something crazy unique and awesome. :)"

"Need some serious help with guitar effects and live tone.","I've played a lot of shows and been able to get by with just my amp distortion, but here are the issues I've had that I'd like to finally correct: a lot of feedback at times, solos not cutting through, and mediocre clean tone. It's evident to me that I'll probably need a noise gate and some kind of solo boost. So how can I use a noise gate without messing up my clean channel and boosted lead sustain? Also, how can I activate multiple effects at once? For instance, I'd love to be able to hit just one pedal to switch from distortion to clean AND activate reverb and delay, etc. Any suggestions?"
"Need some serious help with guitar effects and live tone.","You need a noise gate that uses the signal coming from your guitar to decide when to open and close but chokes the signal somewhere else in the chain.

I *think* you can do this with both the Boss NS-2 and the MXR Noise Clamp.

It sounds like you're after a pedal switcher of some sort, something like [this from Voodoo Labs](http://www.voodoolab.com/switcher.htm)."
"Need some serious help with guitar effects and live tone.","Personally I swear by multi-effects boards. One press on a pedal and you can change as many sounds and effects as you like. I have to use a complicated pedal arrangement in order to make use of the amp's distortion but it's worthwhile."
"Need some serious help with guitar effects and live tone.","I'd try adjusting the tone controls on your amp before buying a lot more gear. Try rolling off the presence and/or highs, and turning up the mids a tad.

A good OD will go a long way for that solo boost (and ""clean"" tone).

What kind of amp do you have? It also might be time to replace some tubes..."
"Need some serious help with guitar effects and live tone.","Thanks guys, very helpful so far. I'm playing through a Peavey 6505+. I've been able to correct some of my issues with the tone controls. I know how to get a good sound out of it, sure. But to eliminate feedback I've always had to reduce the volume or gain - not great for the sound I'm going for, but fairly adequate for live situations. At this point I'm planning on borrowing some pedals from a friend and just trying some things out to see what I can figure out on my own. If I have to turn off the noise suppressor in order to play a clean section, so be it. 

I've always been more interested in the playing side of things than the gear, but it's catching up with me as my standards are becoming higher. Why sound just passable when you could sound unforgettable?"
"Need some serious help with guitar effects and live tone.","I've noticed that when playing live, my guitar really sounds better when you dial down the gain - that way you can have a lot punchier sound when the amp is cranked up. Tube amps work really well this way.

You should also discuss about the problem with your bass player. Maybe you can together figure out how to make your overall sound better. But mainly, turn the distortion down. Hopefully this helps!"

"Hey everyone. I'm a new redditor and I released this today. Care to listen? Let me know what you think!","Thanks, man! I use a limited DAW, Cakewalk SONAR LE. I'm limited to 25 effects, 30 tracks, and 8 buses. I would've mixed it better if I could."
"Hey everyone. I'm a new redditor and I released this today. Care to listen? Let me know what you think!","Very cool. Any details you wouldn't mind sharing on your recording setup?"
"Hey everyone. I'm a new redditor and I released this today. Care to listen? Let me know what you think!","Sure! 

I plug my guitar into a Livewire SPDI Passive DI Box to split the signals: one going to the amp, and one going straight into a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 USB Interface where I record the two signals, the wet/amp signal and the dry signal. That's all I have in regards to hardware. As for the gear I used in this recording, specifically, I used an LTD AX-50 plugged into an iPad 2 with a Line 6 Mobile In Guitar Interface running Positive Grid JamUP Pro.

For software in terms of mixing, I use Cakewalk SONAR LE for my DAW, which limits me to 30 tracks, 25 effects, and 8 buses. For drums, I use Toontrack EZDrummer with the Metal Machine EZX. As for plugins, I use stuff from SONAR, some of the Ignite Amps plugins (TSB-1, NadIR, SHB-1), some from TSE (BOD v2.0, X30), some Focusrite Scarlett plugins, and Waves OneKnob Louder if I need it. For mastering, I use Acoustica Mixcraft 5 and I use the Acoustica Compressor, the Classic Master Limiter, and Waves OneKnob Louder.

Hope this helps!"

"Help with down picking?","I've recently come back to the guitar after a long break, and I feel as if I've been busting my ass trying to get my endurance and speed back, but I don't seem to be making much progress. Anyone have any good exercises for this?"
"Help with down picking?","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3bxzArZPTQ
3:14"
"Help with down picking?","waw he's incredibly fast!"
"Help with down picking?","Creeping Death is actually one of the songs that I practice every time. I'm gonna have to give that Slayer song a shot, though. I probably also should have added that I recently got a longer strap so I could have my guitar hang lower. I've caught myself using my shoulder and arm a lot when I pick fast and I've always been told that's a bad thing. So I figured by hanging my guitar lower, I could keep my arm straighter and force myself to only use my wrist as a result."
"Help with down picking?","[deleted]"
"Help with down picking?","I also practice Enter Sandman. Not for speed, obviously, but because it's a good tool for working on picking consistency, e.g. to make extended chords have as much chunk as palm mutes.

Edit: Sometimes I can't grammar when I'm high."
"Help with down picking?","A lot of people recommend practicing uppicking as fast as possible. Personally, I never found it to be as effective as just practicing downpicking. Start slow with something like Disposable Heroes (the main verse riff has alternate picking patterns thrown in too, but it gets brutal on the right hand). Once songs around that speed become comfortable, move on to faster and faster songs. Also, if you're ever just bored and watching tv or something, grab your guitar and just practice picking. It really only takes one hand, so you could be doing tons of other fun activities with your free hand! Tl;dr Practice up picking, down picking, and jam to some thrash. That should bring you up to speed in no time. "
"Help with down picking?","I also use Metallica songs as exercises for downpicking. My go-tos are Master of Puppets and Blackened. "
"Help with down picking?","Just slowly down pick and progressively get faster"
"Help with down picking?","A lot of good advice here, but they forgot one thing. Metronomes really do help with your speed. Always practice with one. "
"Help with down picking?","If you have at least two guitars, put the heaviest gauge strings it can handle on your practice instrument, leaving your recording/concert instrument how you normally prefer it. 

If you have a DAW or some other software that can do time compression/expansion independently of pitch, load songs you want to learn into it and increase their tempo by 1/3 (if the song isn't already breakneck speed). 

When you go back to normal speed and string gauge, everything will be a lot more manageable.

Practice to a metronome.

Also keep in mind that it's not all about down-picking—the notion that down-picking is superior is both false and irrelevant. Think of downstrokes and upstrokes as analogous to a drummer's left and right hand. Picking patterns are always contextual—when you're soloing or doing rhythm work that branches off from straight 4/4 time, very rarely will straight down-picking, straight up-picking, or straight alt-picking be ideal. Patterns need to be figured out and have a pre-meditated strategy implemented to be very effective, just as a drummer will rarely use a straight LLLLL–, RRRR–, or RLRL– pattern to execute a perfect lick or fill."
"Help with down picking?","No, I understand that there are picking techniques, and I use them all a fair amount. I just wanted to work on improving that one particular aspect of picking as a whole."
"Best way to make drum tracks on a computer?","I wanna start making some demos but don't know how to play drums. Help?"
"Best way to make drum tracks on a computer?","You're going to need two pieces of software, one of which you may already have, and possibly one piece of hardware. The first piece of software is a DAW, a digital audio workstation, which is basically the digital equivalent of a recording studio. There are several available: Ableton Live, Logic (Mac only), ProTools, FL Studio, Digital Performer, Reason (not exactly a DAW and might not have all the features you need), Studio One, and probably several others. I've used several and find Ableton Live to be the most intuitive and user-friendly. 

Then you need your virtual instrument, your software drum machine. Again, several available. The Toontrack Drumkit from Hell is the standard for metal and has appeared on releases by Meshuggah and Devin Townsend. I've never tried it; I personally like Addictive Drums. Battery, by Native Instruments, also works well for metal (especially if you want to get a little experimental) but isn't very intuitive.

The virtual instrument (VSTi) is a plugin that is hosted by your DAW. When you want to create tracks, you open your DAW, then open the plugin within the DAW, and get to work, either plugging in the MIDI notes manually (ask me if you don't know what MIDI is or don't understand what you read when you look it up) or recording them with a keyboard or another MIDI instrument.

The piece of hardware you may or may not need is an audio interface, which allows you to get high-quality sound into and out of your computer. If you have another way getting your guitar and vocal tracks digitized and into your DAW, you won't need it. If you have another way of getting your digital drum tracks out of your computer and mixed with your other instruments, you won't need it. But if you want to record your other instruments directly into your DAW, or record the output of your DAW into a multi-track recorder, you're going to need one of these. Lots of these available with a variety of features and for a variety of platforms."

"Bridges and transition between riffs","I really like the riffs I write, I just don't know how to fit them together.  Is there any advice out there on how to make a song flow with transitions, bridges, tempo changes etc?  
Thanks  "
"Bridges and transition between riffs","So, the way look at this is that you've already written your riffs or everything as far as general sections go for a full song. But not you want to figure out how to bridge the gaps between them. So you're going from Writing/Composing to Arranging.

There may different ways to do this, and you'll have to fine tune thing to gt them the way you want. First, you have to be sure, or at least have a clear idea, of what order your parts are gonna be in. You should currently have in your mind what's your intro/outro, chorus, verse, any breakdowns or whatever. Then, open up a DAW, any will do. Get your tempo going, then start recording. Its just a rough draft so you dot have to really sorry about messing up or anything. Bonus points if you can use a drum machine to sit in, its like jamming with yourself. 

As you start to record your parts, you'll run into those walls where you need a transition, so when this happens, try to play something that will fit in your song. If your song is fast, maybe try some kind of buil up. If its slow, try a fill or like a variation of some sort. I really don't know how to explain it. Im actually really bad at transitions, but this is what I'm doing to work on it. Nevertheless, record your music man. Throw shit together, even if it doesn't fit. You don't want to forget those riffs man. I've forgotten so many good ass riffs, its a damn shame. "

"Deconstructing the 2 note riff in Black Metal","Bad choice of words on my part. I mean open strings, why every song is in E. But Open Tuning would certainly work and I think it could produce some great results"
"Deconstructing the 2 note riff in Black Metal","(Pardon my beginner questions)

In the video you're just in standard tuning?"
"Deconstructing the 2 note riff in Black Metal","Yep E Standard. Most black metal I know of is, I should have taken the time to make that clear"

"Deconstructing the 2 note riff in Black Metal","I wish I knew more about drumming because that's my favorite side of black metal musicianship,  there's so many different things a drummer can play under the same riff and make it sound completely different. I might try doing something like that using samples. Another idea I had in mind was lyrics. Both will take some time to prepare but fortunately I get bored easily and that's when I make em"
"Deconstructing the 2 note riff in Black Metal","Cool. Look forward to more!!"
"Deconstructing the 2 note riff in Black Metal","Good lesson for beginners!

When in doubt, consult Darkthrone."
"Deconstructing the 2 note riff in Black Metal","I originally had a bit pointing out how Mayhem and Burzum didn't really use two note riffs, not to the extent of Dark throne at least. But I couldn't play the damn riffs (Freezing Moon and Ea) so I cut it out. It took me about 7 tries to play that Angantyr riff too. Dark throne's so simple yet so good"
"Deconstructing the 2 note riff in Black Metal","Come to think of it I can't think of a Mayhem song that makes use of it extensively. Bursum uses more full chords but I do recall when he did his demonstration video, at least one of the songs was made up of a running low E with a higher note on the 5th string being played.

The quintessential example though would have to be Darkthrone's Transilvanian Hunger, and there probably were some songs on panzerfaust that did the same too. Not familiar enough with Gorgoroth or Immortal to point out any songs but I'm sure they did it too."
"Deconstructing the 2 note riff in Black Metal","Holy shit! This is **exactly** what I've been looking for.

I'm very much a beginner guitar player and also a huge black metal fan. I've found it fairly difficult to find any information on how to play black metal.

Your video really opened my eyes! I just wish my guitar was near by. 

Another challenge I face as a beginner is getting the black metal tone. Could you do a video on black metal tone? Maybe cross a few of the sub-genres? (raw, symphonic, Norwegian, etc.)"
"Deconstructing the 2 note riff in Black Metal","Ah, tone actually plays a huge part in the 2 note riff, that was something I wanted include. I knew I was missing something. 

High treble opens up difference between the bass note and harmony, a heavy bass tone would make everything sound fat which is great for chugging but not tremolo picking. Another way black metal separates itself from Death metal.

One thing I do differently though is I don't scoop mids, which is part of getting that thin, Darkthrone sound.

I'm not a huge gearhead so I don't know everything about getting the right sound but it's definitely something I'll try, thanks for the suggestion"
"Deconstructing the 2 note riff in Black Metal","Thanks for the response!

I look forward to more videos from you."
"Deconstructing the 2 note riff in Black Metal","What is the signal/effect chain you're using in the video? It sounds surprisingly good for a single isolated guitar. "
"Deconstructing the 2 note riff in Black Metal","I actually have no gear at all, the effects are all run through a Vox Valvetronix AD100VT-XL which has preset effects, I tweaked my sound to the one I like the most. No idea how it's setup, but on my side, I have the gain. At 75%, treble at 60% bass at 50%, and mids at 75%. I use the bridge pickup on a stock Jackson RR3 with the tone knob about 80%. That's all I can say."

I didn't go into specific details about my personal tone settings, but if you're curious:

My Amp is a Vox Valvetronix AD100VT-XL. [Specs and description](http://www.voxshowroom.com/uk/amp/ad100xl.html). It is a high gain tube preamp/solid state hybrid which includes [preset amp models](http://www.voxshowroom.com/uk/amp/xl_overview)

The model I use is ""Black"", coincidentally. It was not designed for black metal, but for ""Black Album Metallica"" apparently (just learned that . . .). I can't actually tell you how that part works. But I can tell you about my knobs.

I have my Bass in the middle, Treble at about 60%. Traditionally, someone would scoop the mids but I boost mine to about 75%. Guitar side, I have a stock Jackson RR3, and I use the bridge pickup, a Seymour Duncan JB TF-4 (For the record, I don't know jack about the details of any of this stuff). I have my volume knob at max, and my tone know at about 80% (I kind of just eye it, turn the knob to max and then dial it down about a quarter turn).

Not sure if you can get anything out of this since you probably don't have the same gear, but I hope it helps. Trial and error pretty much got me to where I am."

"How do you ""dirty up"" the sound (specifically harsh cymbal tone?)","Hi. I'm going to work on a solo doom project soon and all I've used so far for my thrash and grind are randomized acoustic drum samples. They sound decent (they'd sound better if I knew how to EQ properly lol.) Anyways, I'm really interested in heavy and harsh metal productions in doom. I want to know how you get that sound that makes all of the cymbals seem really washed over one another like one really big long crashy sounding hiss. Take a listen to these songs briefly and just spot the loudness of the overall tone but especially the HHHCCAASSHHHAASSHHH kinda thing in the background.

Monothiest would be a classic reference point.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1t1Sti8Z3M

But especially a lot of stuff from Church of Misery, In think they offer a good example.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7eP-DFReyA

So what's the secret? Is it just boosting the high frequencies or a whole ton of compression? Should I put my cymbals through a distortion filter? What do you guys do in general to your tone/EQ process to make it sound more metal? Do you have a specific process or just find default presets you like in an advanced DAW and then leave it alone? My rig is pretty bare bones and I want to know what I can do to get those results."
"How do you ""dirty up"" the sound (specifically harsh cymbal tone?)","I send the drums through a reverb, in most cases totally wet. You can experiment with it and just send the cymbals through it. Different Reverbs offer different tones, modify hall or even try spring reverb.
For Doom songs, i sometimes even place the drums in a cathedral:
https://soundcloud.com/infold/d-j-vu
(Demo, no EQ or Compression)

Is this what you mean with ""washed""? If you want to harsh up the cymbals, also slight eq + compression will help you shape the sound."
"How do you ""dirty up"" the sound (specifically harsh cymbal tone?)","Thanks, that's mostly what I'm talking about. I think it sounds killer!"
"How do you ""dirty up"" the sound (specifically harsh cymbal tone?)","Listening to the tracks your posted, its definitely reverb and some EQ giving them that tone. I cant speak for the EQ you'd need for the speakers without hearing them and generalizing a lot, but a nice cut below approx 5.5 kHz should give you a bit more room in the mix. If you can post a sample i can work out a good decent EQ for you.

As for the reverb, what you need is a quite a long reverb, in a smaller room, but your gonna want a couple of milliseconds pre delay too. Most build in reverbs should have controls you can fiddle about with, so you shouldnt have to buy any software."
"How do you ""dirty up"" the sound (specifically harsh cymbal tone?)","Well, I haven't done any recording yet with that project in particular. But I think this is the best drum tone I've gotten so far (from a grind song) and I used reverb on the snares and cymbals as well as boosted some high frequencies.

https://soundcloud.com/vincent_wisehoon/rot

Both tweaks were very minor though. You can still hear cymbals like they're individual shuffles, it sounds more like a tech-death kit or something. I think I will take your advice though and try that specific cut as well as drench it in small room reverb."

I recommend a [RODE NT1-A](http://www.rodemic.com/mics/nt1-a) as a good but not mega expensive mic for acoustic guitar and vocals.  The acoustic tone in this track is not bad though... has a nice dark quality to it that suits the track.  

The track kicks ass!  Great riffs... love the tremelo picking and blast beats in particular.  Guitars are pretty tight (in most places) and the tone is good.  The bass tone is not so good... I don't think it compliments the guitars very well... there is a low 'honking' sound in there somewhere that is fighting the guitars for attention... you could fix that with EQ but I would start from scratch and record one track of clean/slightly dirty bass and one track of fuzzed out bass and blend/EQ/compress from there.

The drums sound very Toontrack-ish...  I highly recommend multisampling the kick, snare, and toms... it will help stop your drums sounding like every other Toontrack user (assuming that is what you are using)...  I tend to go for three of each... for example, a sub kick, a mid kick, and a clicky kick.  This will make your drums sound super fat (to match the chunky guitar tone) and will reduce the need for heavy compression."
"Band of the Hawk (Power/Thrash Metal)","Haha, yeah, that's what I meant, I hear condenser mics are amazing for acoustics.

That's great advice on the bass! I totally agree with you, that's my weakest link of my signal chain right now. Sounds like farts instead of having that good growl and it's annoying the hell out of me. I'm just using my Pod HD for my bass tone, do you think I should just go DI and use the tips you provided? I'll also look at getting a better set of strings for my bass to help prevent that honking sound you described.

And yes, Toontrack indeed, haha. The Metalheads EZX for EZDrummer, specifically. That's a really interesting method that I've never considered, I'll definitely try that out with my DFH EZX and the stock kit.

Again, great constructive advice, I'll"
"Band of the Hawk (Power/Thrash Metal)","I would use the POD for your bass... does it have bass amps on it?  Been so long since I've used Line6.  You could always record additional tracks with the DI if you wanted to for whatever reason... but I find that DI bass with plugins instead of amps tend to be too weak for metal."
"Band of the Hawk (Power/Thrash Metal)","Unfortunately Line 6 really screwed over bass users for the Pod HD and there's only one bass amp in the entire thing, the ""Flip Top"" that's based on the Ampeg B-15NF Portaflex. I'll try messing around with that more, I'm currently using a different model."
"Band of the Hawk (Power/Thrash Metal)","I messed around with making a new bass patch for the Pod HD and came up with this, does it sound better to you? https://soundcloud.com/guerillagorillas/new-bass-tone-comparison"
"Band of the Hawk (Power/Thrash Metal)","Yeah it sits under the guitar much better now!  Since the bass now has that nice scoop to make room for the guitar, it seems like it has taken a slight dip in volume... maybe try some parallel compression or multitracking to beef it up."
"Band of the Hawk (Power/Thrash Metal)","Awesome! I now notice that dip in volume as well, I'll definitely try doing some parallel compression. I've never tried it before but there's no better time to learn it than now."
"Band of the Hawk (Power/Thrash Metal)","Going back to my metal roots for this song, this was a whole lot of fun to do, let me know what you think!

I'm also trying to teach myself how to master my own music, so this is the first song I've finished that has actually been mastered. Any feedback on the mix/master is greatly appreciated! Although I can already guess that the bass is too loud here."
"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","I'm considering geting the metal adpak or drumkit from hell.

Which one do you guys think is best? I personally use the original addictive drums without the metal adpak, but for some reason if I convert my midi to addictive drums, the midi map is not the same... so someone made a converter but it leaves out some cymbals and what not which is annoying. Superior drummer's midi map is the same as windows, but I like the sound more on addictive drums...


Consider that I will be playing 90's style death metal."
"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","Used both. Here's my opinion. 

Addictive Drums: if you want a kit that sounds like a miced kit with very little work? Bam. It's great for getting a fantastic sound quickly. My work flow is to build my sections until I am happy, then before I mix my whole track, I explode my midi to individual tracks, and transform them to audio. That way I get individual audio for snare, tom, kick etc. And then I compress and expand and reverb them as I see fit, like a real kit. It makes for a pretty chunky sound in a pretty easy way. 

Superior Drummer: I have less experience here, as I don't own this, I've used elsewhere. The sample library is huge. If you want to tweak, this is tweak heaven. The issues for me were entirely work flow, and I think given time I would probably be able to get better results from this program, despite the overwhelming amount of choice. 

If you are okay with it, I recommend tormenting both before you purchase. I did this when I bought Addictive Drums. I tried about 4 different options, and bought my favourite. :) "

"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","Coolio! I'm in the RDDT main clan, so if you pop over to /r/worldoftanks anytime, and we have a teamspeak that should be in the sidebar. :) "
"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","the only problem I have with AD is that when I paste my midi to the DAW and load up AD, the midi is on different keys, ie, the cymbal on my midi program is a tom trigger on AD.

This was on AD1, I don't know if its corrected on AD2, but I would want to know beforehand because that was an inconvenience. 

EDIT: NVM I found out  you can edit the keymap in AD2. So I'm gonna get AD2 with the metal adpak, it just sounds... better to me, idk."
"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","Yus! You can edit the key map in AD1 as well! I have a map for my Maschine Mikro if I ever want to manually enter drums. 

Fun store, punk band that me and my dad know had a gig. We knew the live engineer for the gig, and he used a Presonus desk! We got him to give us the recorded stems for the night, and we would mix them for the band. Great idea. 

We didn't have the time code for the files. And I foolishly turned on stretch. Which meant... Oh nooooooooes. Everything was like 1.5 times speed. But as we had never seen this band live, we just thought ""holy shit these guys are fast"".

The live engineer we know is a typical sound guy. Almost no gain used and he slammed the faders for the live mix. Yay. So the drums sounded shite. I decided to trigger the drums into Addictive drums using gates as triggers and that worked well! Then the guys hear it and are like ""uh, that's super fast."" 

Shit. So we get the speed about right and I retrigger everything. Except there is one point where the drummer is doing the Wipeout style floor tom hits, and it's too quiet and fast for my gate to pick up. I say screw it. Break out my Maschine, slow the track down and manually play his tom part, velocity and all, on the pads. Speed it up, he never knew the difference. 

Addictive Drums. For when you want to trigger a kit and have the musician never know! :D "
"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","I can only speak about Tooktrack because I've never used Addictive Drums, but do NOT get Drumkit From Hell. It's been around so long, you can easily spot it on a mix. Now, of course that's just opinion but if you're showing off your mixes to fellow metal musicians and writers who use samplers, I'd worry about looking unprofessional

Here's a suggestion: get EzDrummer 2 and the Metal Machine EXZ, or Made Of Metal EZX. You could also do with getting a MIDI loops pack from Toontrack as well since they feature Dirk Verbeuren, an amazing metal drummer.

EzDrummer 2 is incredibly useful for writing. Superior Drummer 2 is all about tweaking the sounds. Both play EZX files. "
"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","Just bought Ezdrummer 2 on the black friday sale. Do you recommend Made of Metal, Metal Machine, or Metal!?
"
"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","I like metal machine because it's done by Sneap"
"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","Yeah, that's a plus. "
"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","Made of Metal is getting some major hype right now. I think it sound awesome. "
"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","I know. The hype is there, but almost no reviews. I saw Ola Englunds demo and it sounded pretty beastly, just like everything else he demos. I'm looking for speed metal stuff. "
"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","Tools are all how you use them. I sampled my drummers kit and I've used it from death metal, djent, metalcore, alternative, rock and softer. It was a Pearl Masters kit though, so that may have accounted of its versatility. "
"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","True... Nothing beats real drums, except maybe SD since they offer so many options. Do you just use midi loops or do you piano roll them or something?"
"Addictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?","Took the individual samples (1200+ when I finally narrowed it down) and made it into a Kontakt instrument. From there, I just piano roll it like anything else. Standard GM.

"Fellow musicians, can you please provide feedback on this sound sample?",""
"Fellow musicians, can you please provide feedback on this sound sample?"," Your mix, while I can technically hear everything, is missing the heart of the tone. That comes from your guitars. Your rhythm guitars are almost non existent. Your guitar tone seems very scooped in the mid-range... Mids are your friend my man! Also, it feels like everything is so saturated with reverb that it all sounds like it's 10 miles away. Your main vocal is HEAVY on the right side. If it were me, I'd go and remove any reverb from anything that has the word guitar in it. I'd also pan the vocals dead center and remove any stereo effects on them. Lastly I would bring the drums up in the mix and bring the keys down. Keys are best with a lot of space, but you have them cranked here. I would even go so far as to say they might even be louder than the drums, which takes away from the punch of your recording. 

Hope this helps brother!"

"Screaming vocalist looking for mic advice?","Alright, I'm looking for a good mic for screaming vocals for kinda cheap. Around $50 preferably. I'm thinking about the Shure SM48-LC. 

Any help is appreciated."
"Screaming vocalist looking for mic advice?","If you're looking for live, get a 58... if studio, SM7B"
"Screaming vocalist looking for mic advice?","I would suggest saving up until you can afford something nice. My go-to mic for screaming vocals is always a Shure SM7b. Most metal records within the past 10 or so years have utilized this mic. One great example is Between The Buried And Me. It is pretty expensive new, but look for one used to save a couple bucks. These things (like Mose of Shure's lineup) are built like tanks so you won't be sacrificing quality going used. "
"Screaming vocalist looking for mic advice?","Look at your local pawn shops, I got a SM58 for 50$ and it hasn't failed me yet. I can link some test clips for you to hear it, I dont use VSTs on clips so they are all raw."
"Screaming vocalist looking for mic advice?","That'd be cool. I won't be able to hear them till later though.

"Screaming vocalist looking for mic advice?","I just picked up a standard mic cable. "
"Screaming vocalist looking for mic advice?","I've had my Shure SM58 for seven years now and it has taken some beating along the way but still works without any problems. It's around a 100 bucks though, but it has paid itself back already."
"Screaming vocalist looking for mic advice?","If I had the money, I definitely would go for it. If I can find it cheaper, I'll try for it.  

Also, do mics normally come with cords anyway or always separate? "
"Screaming vocalist looking for mic advice?","Well I bought [a set from Thomann](http://www.thomann.de/gb/shure_sm58_set.htm) that comes with a stand and cord, and if you look at the price of the set and the mic alone, it's smarter to just buy the set.

But normally they don't come with a cord."
"Screaming vocalist looking for mic advice?","Shure SM57 or 58. "
"Screaming vocalist looking for mic advice?","Save for a 58, you won't need to buy another mic for years. If you scrimp on a mic and pay half of what you pay for a 58, you'll have to buy another one and it will die as well before the 58 would have.

Besides being rough on the mic due to the environment it's in, a cheap mic won't hold up to screaming. Neither will a a good speaking mic. I blew up the diaphragm of my school's Bose mic with only 2 rehearsals for the Battle of the Bands 1997. 

I use a 58a Beta. All of my kids have played with it or slobbered on it as babies. I just give the sock a wash. They drop it, I drop it, and the cage is still in perfect shape."
"Screaming vocalist looking for mic advice?","I'm gonna see if I can get one cheaper on Amazon. everyone here is praising the 58, so I may as well try.   :)"

What drums are you using for this? It sounds a bit like there is a machine gun effect at around 0:58 where the blast beat kicks in.

Usually, I would change the individual velocities of each snare hit to give a bit of variation.

Other than that, I'd say you're golden man. This is good stuff! :)

The program is addictive drums. I've got to stop being lazy and start tweaking velocities more to get a realistic sound. The humanize feature in the midi editor doesn't do the trick for me.

My guitar is a Schecter Omen 8 w/ stock pickups, as you can tell I'm using it as a 7 string here. All the Vsts I used are free, its a Lepou LE456 and Legion for the guitar tracks and I used free cab impulses I can't remember what they are ATM.

We've also been having a hard time classifying which genre this would fall under, and so far ""metal"" is the only one people seem to agree on. 

'Higher Up' was intended to feel a bit more metal and melodic, while Bawstayge is more of a 'rocky-video-game' with mostly metal undertones.

"Two original instrumentals a friend and I finished almost two years ago, would really appreciate feedback if anyone has the time.","First off I really like what you're doing. The songwriting is really up my alley and some of the better stuff I've heard recently.

Some constructive criticism about the mix on your first song:

A LOT of your audible spectrum is living in the trebles of your cymbals. They're slightly overpowering the guitar tracks (which in this case should be the feature) and, in my opinion, don't sit tightly in the mix. My suggestion would be to bring back the level of your overheads a bit and maybe roll off some of the treble on the cymbal tracks. I would suggest trying one, then the other, then both if you're not getting the sound you like. The rest of the drums seem to fit alright so this is the only suggestion I have there. 

Other than that I might suggest boosting the bass a bit. You don't want it too overpower the guitars but to add to them so that the seem to have more resonance and add some power to the mix. Boost carefully a couple dB at a time while listening to the entire track to find a sweet spot.

The crossfade at the beginning is awesome. You might try boosting the guitars a little more smoothly as their level seems to ""jump"" a little once they take over the mix. This might also be caused if you're dropping off the strings immediately rather than crossfading them out. Either way right at about :23 there's a noticeable boost in the waveform that tells me somethings not happening as smoothly as you might like. 

I'm not hearing the kick too much. If I really listen it's there but it's being overpowered by both the lower end of the bass and the trebles in your guitar and cymbals. My suggestion would be to see if you can carve out a niche for it in those areas of the eq. Solo the kick track and boost the eq with a narrow band. Sweep until you find a sweet spot where it sounds really good then mark that spot. Normalize the EQ again for the track and try dragging out a little space in the eq of the other tracks. This way it has some room to breathe and come through more audibly.

For the second track:

Cymbals seem to be almost the opposite here. A little too diminished volume and not as airy as the other track. The hi-hat especially I had a hard time picking out at certain points. All in all I think it just needs a little more focus and tweaking.

The kick and guitars sound great and there's a good balance with the bass as well. Only suggestion here is that the bass is a little limp style wise. It mostly follows the guitars but doesn't come through as a separate instrument so the rhythm guitar sounds a little woofy (that's a musical term if I've ever made one up). Maybe try adding a little variation to the part to make it stand out.

Note that I'm making these judgements based only on listening through my macbook speakers and they might not be referencing very well. 

All in all I really like your stuff. Good work!"
"Two original instrumentals a friend and I finished almost two years ago, would really appreciate feedback if anyone has the time.","Wow thanks, I wasn't expecting such in-depth criticisms. Basically we are aware the mix needs work, since we're just practicing, but thanks for the feedback on both topics (songwriting and production). We felt the same way about the bass too, there are pretty nifty bass riffs that are almost invisible due to overpowering but we're definitely going to try all these things out. Thanks for taking the time!"

"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","Hi all. I play lead guitar and do a lot of metal solos. I'm really torn between a Floyd Rose or Hardtail model of the Schecter Hellraiser C1. I've done my research, and I've come up with the following results:

Floyd Rose:

Pros:

* Stays in tune better
* Can do dive bombs and harmonic vibrato with whammy bar

Cons:

* Hard to change tunings
* Hard to change strings
* Worse sustain
* Goes out of tune when a string breaks

Hardtail:

Pros:

* Easily change tunings
* Better sustain
* Stays in tune when string breaks
* Easy to change strings

Cons:

* No dive bombs or harmonic vibrato
* Have to tune more often

What do you guys think? Does anyone have anything to add here? I guess now that I'm looking at the list, there are more pros to the hardtail than the floyd rose, but I can't make up my damn mind!"
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","I've been a die hard hardtail fan my whole life. After a while dive bombs just start to sound predictable. I do have a guitar though with a floyd rose and a locking nut, but the back of the bridge is bolted into the guitar body, so I don't actually use it, but the shit *never* goes out of tune."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","You know what's funny is my Ibanez RG has a FR and it still goes out of tune, albeit very slowly. I do a lot of solos with bends, so as the strings stretch out, I have to turn the fine tuning knobs to keep it in tune. Then at some point I reach the end of the threads and I have to unlock the nut and tune the whole thing again to reset the fine tuning knobs. So even that part is shit."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","I mean occasionally I will have to reach down and readjust, but it's really really *really* stable."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","Then a hardtail would be having the same, if not worse, issues.
"
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","At least it's just a matter of tuning the knobs, rather than dealing with the locking nut and balancing the trem all over again."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","Pedals can divebomb and vibrato. Pedals can't make your guitar reliable. Hardtail is the way to go imo."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","If you're not going to change tunings often (or ever), get the Floyd. You can always block it off, plus you've got the option of using it for Floyd-y shit.

Personally, I can't stick with a tuning for more than a day so I only have hardtails."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","The tremolo is a whole other instrument.  If you're going to *play* it, please do so.

But, if you're just going to wank on it like you haven't gotten laid in a year, please leave it at home."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","Hahaha.. yeah I'd probably just wank it"
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","[deleted]"
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","If you're going to use the Floyd Rose, try using it lightly on chords for a shimmery sound a la Rush's Red Sector A. That's a sorely underutilized technique.

Other than that, I can't say much, as I'm a bassist. I have heard that having a ~~tremolo~~ vibrato bar makes one lazy on using ""regular"" vibrato (that is, with the fretting hand)."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","Here's how i see it. If this is your only guitar with a tremolo, go ahead and get it. The option to use it is there if you want to implement it, and if not, it's not like the guitar is going to be unplayable. Minor inconveniences like tuning and sustain are not going to ruin the guitar.

I would skip the Floyd if you have another guitar with a tremolo though. It's a small feature that you probably only need on one guitar, so getting another will just cause more headaches when trying to set up."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","So yeah I have a low end Ibanez RG with a FR that I was planning on selling, but now I'm thinking I'll just keep both so I have that option.

Sounds like the hardtail is the way to go. That's what my gut tells me anyway."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","Floyd Rose, I think, wins out for lead.  Especially if you want to get kinky and nasty with it.  The trouble that you've found and others have pointed out is they're a pain in the arse to change strings.  That can be remedied to some degree by switching out the stock tremolo for another one that takes the bullet-end strings.  The slot-and-go aspect of that kind of set up reduces at least some of the buggering about you've got to do with a standard FR.

  (I think it may prove less costly than pedals to do the same job for a fixed bridge.  Depends on your area and who can get on what I suppose)"
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","up to you. If you like divebombs and vibratos and shit for you music, go for floyd rose.

I personally hate the wankery, and I like the ability to tun my guitar instantly. Hardtail wins for me. "
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","What Floyd are you talking about when you say it stays in tune better and you have to tune it less than a hardtail?

A Floyd is a floating bridge and any fluctuation in string tension affects the other strings tension. 

Sustain on floyds can be fixed with a few mods - see floyd upgrades .com"
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","I'm pretty sure the hardtail will stay in tune better. I have a double locking floyd rose, a (licensed) single locking F.R. and a bunch of hardtails and the hardtails always seem to stay in tune better. For me, its really about how bad you want to use the f.r. and if you are willing to deal with the tuning issues that come with it. If ypu really plan on using it, then get it. If you're not really sure, then get a hardtail. Or....  why not get both? Lol"
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","Really? I thought that was the big draw of the FR is that it stays in tune better. F that then I'm going hard tail for sure"
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","The draw is that when you bend a whole chord, it stays in tune with itself. As far as I understand."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","Floyd rose stays in tune better than any other tremolo maybe.

Edit- also, the are different models of floyd rose, and there are ""licensed"" floyd roses that are a floyd rose design, but made by a knock off company. But even my real double locking floyd rose goes out of tune more than any of my hardtails. Especially if you do a bunch of crazy dimebag whammy abuse."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","Weird, My floyd always stays in tune, and I abuse my whammy a lot."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","If you abuse your whammy a lot and you think its still in tune you are probably tone deaf."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","I guess I might just be lucky with my Floyd though."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","Touché"
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","A lot of guys get and subsequently block off Floyds and the like for additionally tuning stability. The issues only happen with significant whammy bar (ab)use or with lower-end trems."
"Floyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?","Do people seiously believe that a floating tremolo can stay in tune better than a fixed bridge? I didn't mean to offend any f.r. users, I use them myself, and I know for a fact that a fixed bridge has more tuning stability and requires less maintenance than a floating bridge. "
"Suggestions for amplifying/EQing heavily drop-tuned guitars?","I'm preparing to write/record some material for what's effectively a 2 bass, 1 guitar arrangement. My first bass is in E0 A0 E1 A1 D2 and I'm pleased with the tone. My guitar in boring old E-Standard, and sounds like what I had in mind. My main problem comes from my ""bass"" guitar, in E Standard an octave below standard E Standard (27"" scale length, 24 - 84 gauge strings). I gave up on running this guitar through my guitar amp even when it was in B-Standard/Drop-A. Instead I've been running it through my Traynor TB100 bass amp (100 watts, 15"" speaker).
I'm running my guitar through a Boss DD-7 delay, an Eleca EDT-3 Distortion, and finally Electro Harmonix Cathedral Reverb before amplification. I'm aiming for a really heavy arrangement, in a vein similar to Love Sex Machine or Black Sheep Wall, with some Drone influences in the style of Sunn O))). I find that my current sound lacks a certain ""body"" and ""punch"", and the attack of my notes feels weak compared to the sustain. I've wanted to avoid going overboard with my amp's bass knob, but since my bass is tuned so low (~20.6Hz fundamental on the lowest note), I'm not sure if there would be too much overlap in the low end. Does anyone here have any suggestions?"
"Suggestions for amplifying/EQing heavily drop-tuned guitars?","If you're planning on recording this, and you actually have a 20hz fundamental, you'll run into serious problems with mics and recording that way.

The way I track bass is to run it DI, and do it digitally. I usually split it into 2/3 channels and process each separately. 

1 track of highly compressed sub bass, with the mids/highs cut out

1 track running through any good distortion you like (TSE x30, etc), and the low end cut out. This will be the dirt, and some mids

Optional third track is just a normal DI full tone, blended in quiet to taste. Use this for more mids

You're going to have a lot of issues with the bass/drums/ other bass muddying up the low end, you you'll need to be very selective with how you eq them. Pick a frequency range that works for each part and then reduce the others in that area so it pops through.

Also keep in mind when you're tuned that low you're not going to get a very good attack unless you have very good pickups and pick really hard, but that's probably not what you're after for drone.
"
"Suggestions for amplifying/EQing heavily drop-tuned guitars?","The sub-bass isn't the problem, but thank you for your input. I actually wound up doing most of what you just described, since I'm well aware that my mics have a significant falloff around the 40Hz range. I only left out the distortion channel because I just didn't like what it was doing to my sound.

Unplugged, my guitar sounds like it has a decent attack. My strings are still tight and bright. I'm mostly worried about my amplifier, say if such a relatively large speaker would be less responsive to my picking."
"Suggestions for amplifying/EQing heavily drop-tuned guitars?","Turn knob named LOW on amp up. Turn knob named MID up. Loose the Reverb. "
"Suggestions for amplifying/EQing heavily drop-tuned guitars?","Alright, I'll let loose with those two. Why do you suggest dropping the Reverb, though?"
"Suggestions for amplifying/EQing heavily drop-tuned guitars?","Reverb is the buildup of sound as a result of reflections from the initial source in a room (or simulated room). Since lower frequencies are harder to absorb, low frequency energy builds up more than high frequency energy, which is easily absorbed by the rooms contents. Even if you are using a digital reverb, I would assume that it would try to simulate the very same effect.

Therefore pulling back on the reverb on such a high LOW setting will ensure that the low end of your guitar mix doesn't unnecessarily build up and muddy up your mix. Having a low end heavy setup with reverb results in greater low frequency reflections and buildup. "
"Suggestions for amplifying/EQing heavily drop-tuned guitars?","Alright, thanks for the explanation. Truth be told, I would like that extra muddiness for some atmospheric sections of a given piece. Otherwise, I'd likely have the unit bypassed or set on a *very* subtle low setting."
"Suggestions for amplifying/EQing heavily drop-tuned guitars?","You might be better off mixing in the reverb later, then, instead of tracking it."
"Suggestions for amplifying/EQing heavily drop-tuned guitars?","Being muddy and being thick sounding are two different things XD If your mix becomes muddy, your bass frequency buildup will reduce the amount of space and headroom given to your other frequencies, which isn't pleasant on the ears :( 

Perhaps if you want a thicker sound, try giving your guitars a gentle but wide boost at around 200-400Hz so that they thicken up nicely without having to add unwanted lows!   

Also what dhporter said works as well! Just still be very conservative with your reverb during your final edits. Bouncing our your file first then adding a slight amount of reverb to the master file is something some people like to do :D"
"Help finding parts for an old Jackson Dinky Reverse Performer.","Hey all. I have an old Jackson Dinky Reverse Performer that I'm trying to get back in to shape. I would like to order a replacement bridge and locking nut for it but I'm having difficulty finding any information. I've called Jackson but since this guitar is from 1999, they don't have any information on it(the guy said he didn't have any prior to the Fender merger/takeover). The bridge is branded Jackson but is Floyd Rose licensed so I don't know if that means a standard bridge will fit or anything.  I'll follow any leads anyone could potentially provide me with.

The actual quality of what was recorded depends on a huge number of factors, from the quality of the mics and hardware used (even cables) to the preamps and type of recording interface.

"Tips for Mixing Metal Bass Guitar",""
"Tips for Mixing Metal Bass Guitar","Nice tutorial, thank you very much. Just a thought: especially with metal bands, one should keep in mind that the band will most likely be expected to play the song live. So either make sure that they have the gear needed and it can be setup in reasonable time span, or refrain from using plugins or editing for ""special effects"". A signature sound you can't reproduce is rather haunting for a band, i can imagine."
"Tips for Mixing Metal Bass Guitar","Metal can be hard to get to stick. Always comprimising, and when it comes to fast drums (like the blastbeats of tnbm) you will end up choosing either hear the double bass drums or the sharp drum machine gun fire. Cause both wont fit !! Sound is Krieg !! "

"Schecter Hellraiser for lead?","Hi all. I play lead guitar and I do a lot of solo work. I have an Ibanez RG350DX. I saw the Schecter Hellraiser and I fell in love with the look, but I'm wondering if this is more of a lead or rhythm guitar?

First of all it has a glossy neck, so it may not be as fast. The neck is a bit fatter too, and the cutaway isn't as big so the 24th fret may be a stretch.

Does anyone own this guitar and play lead? Maybe I'm just used to my Ibanez, but god damn if the hellraiser isn't the prettiest guitar I've ever seen."
"Schecter Hellraiser for lead?","I used to have a 2006 C-1 Hellraiser and I thought it was great for lead and rhythm.  Synester Gates (or however you spell it) from Avenged Sevenfold used one before he got a signature model.  Jeff Loomis used one for The Psalm of Lydia.  Wish I didn't sell that guitar!  It had the perfect balance of comfort, speed, and tone.  A friend of mine had a 2007 or 8 model and they had rounded the edges on the body... I thought that kinda ruined the tone... just my opinion.

If you aren't sure about it go find one and play it... I'm assuming you are talking about the C-1... they are pretty common if you include the other series' and they all have the same neck and body shape AFAIK.

Could be worth checking out some ESP Horizons too... they generally have thinner necks and better quality."
"Schecter Hellraiser for lead?","I went to guitar center today and all they had was the C7 and the classic. I couldn't get a really good feel for it. They did feel different though. I did get my RG professionally tuned, so that may have something to do with it as well."
"Schecter Hellraiser for lead?","The Classic has the same dimensions as the Hellraiser... it should feel the same to play.  But it has different construction and wood so it won't sound the same."
"Schecter Hellraiser for lead?","You can shred with fat necks just fine, it's all in the angle, it doesn't make you slower or anything. Tone wise Schecters are a little beefier and not as sharp as typical 80's squeaky metal tones (at least with stock pickups). I have a schecter and I like it, but my understanding is that they're more value guitars, and there are better options if you want more flexible or more refined characteristics in a guitar. Again, good for the price, but not perfect. You shouldn't have any problems though, you can get great tones out of it."

"7 string guitar suggestions please?","If you like a fast neck you can always spend a little less on the guitar, get an Ibanez RG7, and then replace the pickups with EMG's or Seymour Duncan's. If you don't want to do that then maybe the Schecter Blackjack ATX or the new KM7(maybe a little expensive). Both come with high end pick ups. The KM7 comes with the passive nazgul/sentient pickups and sounds badass. The Blackjack comes with active Blackouts and also sounds badass.

"My band Stormforge's debut EP ""Sea Of Stone"", Power Metal from Auckland, New Zealand, let me know what you think! (x/post from r/PowerMetal)","Pretty nice stuff. Here are some things to improve:
-Guitar solos aren't really all that enjoyable. It doesn't sound all that thought out, and just kinda sounds like ur expressing ""hey, look how fast i can go"", sounding like there hasn't been much thought put into structure and expression.
-Harmonisations of two melodic guitar sections sound kinda off. It sometimes doesn't sound very good, with the way it currently is.
-Occasional error in timing of guitars can sometimes be off-putting.

However, don't think that I am not liking it, because I listed criticisms. The vocals are really good, and you guys have some really nice ideas. It sometimes gets a bit dragged down in the performance and mix. Keep it up guys, practice is the only way to get better, and I could see this getting really, really good"

"First show scheduled for a month from now. I need a bit of advice for my live setup.","Very excited for the show, but I'm trying to figure out the best way to do everything live. I normally play on my POD HD Pro, although I also have a Peavey XXX Head + Cab.

People have recommended to me to just connect the pod directly to Front of House with an XLR cable, but I think it might be weird playing a show without an amp/cab. I could connect the POD to my effect loop's return on the Peavey (removing the cab sim from my POD patch) and then Mic the cab.

I was also thinking about making a two channel POD patch, one with the cab sim and one without. Connect the channel without the sim to my amp's effects return and then connect the channel with the cab sim to FoH. That way I can monitor with my cab and I have a real amp on stage, but my sound going to the venue is really good too.

Is this a good idea?"
"First show scheduled for a month from now. I need a bit of advice for my live setup.","Let me tell you from experience. I've tried each of the setups and in my opinion running it through your XXX and micing the cab is the best way...unless you have your own sound guy. I also don't like being dependent on the house monitors to hear my guitar, I usually reserve that to hear everyone else for the most part. Really though the POD is so damn versatile you could do it however way you want. I wouldn't worry about the sound in the venue unless its notorious for having a bad mix. If you have time before the show, talk to the sound guy there and ask him what would make his life easier."
"First show scheduled for a month from now. I need a bit of advice for my live setup.","Thanks!

When you say running the pod through the XXX, do you prefer to run it in the effects loop or to just use the pod for effects and use the amp for tone? (four cable method)"
"First show scheduled for a month from now. I need a bit of advice for my live setup.","Well it depends on what base tone you prefer to have. Do you like your amps built in distortion/gain over the pod? If so then the 4 cable method is ideal, that way you can double gate in your signal chain. If you prefer your pods simulations then run that through the FX loop and bypass the XXX's preamp all together. Just remember to turn of cab simulation off and it should sound pretty sweet. The second method is basically turning your XXX into a glorified power amp. "
"First show scheduled for a month from now. I need a bit of advice for my live setup.","A lot of this would depend on the capabilities of the house PA. What size venue is it? Does the sound guy mic everything, or just the kick + vocals? 

Plus, do you have a dedicated sound check, before doors even open? In typical Los Angeles live music setups, only really big headliner / touring metal acts get sound checks before doors. The grunts have to run a quick check right before they start, so think economically, too. The audience may not want to stand there while you and the sound guy figure out monitoring levels for your cab, on-stage monitors for vocals / guitars /etc, as well as house levels for a cab and a direct-in from your POD at the same time.

You say it's your first show - have you ever run just the POD through a house PA with other actual instruments in the mix before? Sorry if these come off as even slightly accusatory - they're not meant to be. 

Personally, I would say to run your POD through the Peavey's effects loop and just mic the cab. It'll sound way better than just running direct through the PA."
"First show scheduled for a month from now. I need a bit of advice for my live setup.","No, you're right, I literally have never gigged before and I haven't just PA'd it yet. I've been meaning to try that, so I'll rent one in the next couple of weeks.

The reason I even thought about this at all was that there are a lot of people online saying they play POD &gt; house and it always sounds amazing for them.

Edit: I'm going to find out about the dedicated sound check. I hope so!"
"For tonehounds, I made some match EQ impulse responses for Revocation's Deathless and The Haunted's Exit Wounds","Designed to be used as the only impulse response following your amp sim, whether VST or Axe FX/Kemper, and to match the guitar tone heard on the album. Tweaking matters, but generally speaking, these will sound best if you use mild settings on your tube screamer and amp. Treble/presence 5-7, bass 6-8, mids 3-5. 

Exit wounds: https://www.dropbox.com/s/w3x7g8vhbwp5bt2/Exit%20Wounds%20IR.wav?dl=0

Deathless: https://www.dropbox.com/s/toorv43l2soeboo/Deathless%20NEW%20IR.wav?dl=0

If anybody's interested in making one, you just find an isolated guitar part on an album you like, put it in your DAW, use an eq match (Ozone and FabFilter have fantastic ones) to match your cab-less amp sim tone to the reference tone, then apply that EQ match curve to a frequency spectrum sweep test tone, leaving a second or two of room on each side of the tone. Export that file and then load it into a deconvolver (Voxengo has one, so does ReaVerb). The deconvolved file is your impulse response. Just make sure to normalize the level of the test tone so it's loud, and of the filtered test tone so it doesn't clip. :)"
"For tonehounds, I made some match EQ impulse responses for Revocation's Deathless and The Haunted's Exit Wounds","This stuff is fun, and I will probably try these out.  But I feel like IR matching album tones is missing something.  If any compression or overdrive was added during the mix, can an IR match capture these?  I'm thinking no..."
"For tonehounds, I made some match EQ impulse responses for Revocation's Deathless and The Haunted's Exit Wounds","There isn't really much reason to ever compress distorted guitar tones, and overdrive should be included through your amp sim of choice long before the cab stage. At any rate, you are correct- it's not perfect, and doesn't capture dynamics- but if you choose the same type of amp for a sim that the player used (here I matched a 5150ii with Dave Davidson's 5150iii, so they're close enough, but I will admit Ola uses a Randall Satan, so the drive won't be the same) it's pretty darn close. It's a usable studio tone with some tweaks at least, and that's all it's really supposed to be; it won't substitute for $2500 amp modeling units."
"For tonehounds, I made some match EQ impulse responses for Revocation's Deathless and The Haunted's Exit Wounds","Poulin also has a free convolver!"
"For tonehounds, I made some match EQ impulse responses for Revocation's Deathless and The Haunted's Exit Wounds","Why on earth would you want to sound like Revocation? Davidson is a killer guitar player but he's got to have one of the most generic tones of all time."
"For tonehounds, I made some match EQ impulse responses for Revocation's Deathless and The Haunted's Exit Wounds","I dunno, I thought the production on Deathless was amazing. And fwiw, 90% of metal players are just using a 5150 of some sort into a cab with an SM57 anyway, so it's only generic if you consider 90% of metal tones to be generic. It has a scratchy high-end reminiscent of an ENGL cab that makes it very interesting to my ears.

Also, if you don't like it, don't download it, ya douche. "

"What are some good ways to spice up my song writing?","Think of neat licks and riffs to squeeze into the bridges between choruses and the verses. A lot of the *spice* in a song comes from those few seconds of transition, and not the actual chorus. It's the buildup, the climb, that everyone loves.  Think of the bridge as a ladder instead of a bridge, and think of the chorus as a diving board. Climb, jump, and make a huge splash. "
"What are some good ways to spice up my song writing?","Variation. Have something repeating 4 times? Do it thrice with a turn-around or twice with a variation then a turn. Our perhaps your turn is repeated twice the second time should be slightly different. Add a simple line with each repeat of the chorus making it larger every time. 

Don't just throw lick after lick into the song. Less music is more. Reduce, reuse, recycle. Listen to Beethoven's 5th. He only wrote those first 4 notes before milking them for everything they're worth. How? Variation."
"What are some good ways to spice up my song writing?","throw in a saxophone solo.   I also agree with the idea of variation.  Take your riff and see what else you can make of it. I know that when I write a song, I can usually make a couple more out of the same riff just by changing the key or timing or adding a few other notes.  And with repetition,  doing things in even/odd patterns can denote certain ""feelings.""  repeating things an even number denotes a sort of resolution, where odd numbers denote instability.  "

I know how broad that sounds, but just take exactly what you're doing at a given... and change it in *any* way you can. I never have any idea of an end ""goal"", I just jam, change, see what's cool or not.

Very simple example: You've got a big chord part with general strumming shit. Sounds boring, lame. Take same chord, start tremolo picking the notes individually. Bam, change, whether it's good or bad, just keep doing this and jamming. Nine times out of ten I eventually get to something semi-usable in a song."
"What are some good ways to spice up my song writing?","Don't think songs have to have a certain structure. Seeing as a basic track will go verse, chorus, verse, chorus, middle 8, chorus, mess that up as much as possible. Adding things like pre choruses, different verses, etc can help. Maybe lay out a song in dynamics, so rather than verse, chorus, verse, etc.. Think like I want it to start quiet, then be loud, then quiet, then louder than before.. That way you can keep a structure, but without the limits of a certain style of section. There's many thing you can, that's just a few.."
"What are some good ways to spice up my song writing?","Learn some exotic scales maybe?  Marty Friedman used a sprinkling Japanese progressions for example, and Megadeth's *Holy Wars* has the Middle Eastern inspired acoustic bit in the middle, so constant research and practice can be handy in this respect.  

  Time signatures are handy musical friend.  A lot of people play in basic 4/4 time which can sometimes come off as predictable.  Bands like Meshuggah do a lot of stuff with odd time signatures and polyrhythmic combinations (maybe a 4/4 drums with a 6/12 guitar track or something) and switching from one time signature to another can add some variety.  The same can be said of tempo.  Thrash uses that to good effect, especially if the tempo change is sudden and violent, it can brake someone ability to predict what's happening in the song."

"Critique/advise me on my songs! Recordings inside.","Your playing is solid, so nothing really a problem there. For ""Qualify for Survival"", the song definitely needs to be double tracked for guitar and have a bass thrown in. The same could go for ""Rabbithole"", as one guitar playing all parts sounds very empty. There are points where, when you're tapping lower strings, the reverb effects are overbearingly boomy over what you are playing, and then when you play higher strings, its almost empty and silent. I would, again, double track to get a stereo mix, then separate dry guitar tracks from the effects in order to get consistent levels on what's played while controlling the wet signal when it overbears. As a cherry on top, you could add synths and shit to make it even more spacey."
"Critique/advise me on my songs! Recordings inside.","So, by double tracking, do you mean record two tracks separately, or arm two tracks to record at once? That would give me two identical tracks for a stereo mix.

I get what you mean about the reverb, I'm new to effects, digital amp modelling etc and was just messing about with it. Previously I've only played direct through the amp!

Also, I don't have a bass, but I could track a bass with a 6 string and shift the pitch down for now. I'm pretty sure I can also use a synth effect on guitar, unless Reaper has built in instruments etc like some DAWs, I haven't really experimented with it much yet.

Thanks for the feedback, really appreciate it :)"
"Critique/advise me on my songs! Recordings inside.","You'll be recording two seperate tracks when double tracking. Duplicating a single track and panning them hard left and right would just give you a louder center track.

If need be, you could ask around here or some other subreddit if you need someone to lay down bass. Pitch shifting a guitar is good for having an idea to work with, but it won't sound good enough keep in the mix."

You now have a stereo track with space in the center to put instruments like bass, however the phase issue cause some frequency cancellations and can sound hollow and distracting. The final part is two separate guitar tracks recorded as perfectly the same as possible, giving a fuller sound while still maintaining stereo.
There are some instances where you may decide to still stick with one guitar track. Usually this means you pan to one side while panning the bass to the opposite. I don't have any metal bands at the top of my head that do this, but i do know that bands like the Beatles and Red Hot Chili Peppers use this technique in lieu of having only one guitarist."

Awesome, thanks for the link. I recorded some stuff last night and double tracked it, it definitely sounds better!"
"Critique/advise me on my songs! Recordings inside.","It only beefs up the sound if you record two separately.  One duplicated track won't overlap the frequencies, they sit exactly on top of each other."

"Critique/advise me on my songs! Recordings inside.","Unfortunately I don't have access to a bass at the moment, but it's something I'm considering for the future. First things first is replacement pickups for my 8 string though. "

"This is my band's song that I recorded and mixed. Tell me what you think!","There's a general lack of ""air"" or ""brightness"" to the mix compared to what I'm used to.  And the vocals are too loud, and probably not compressed enough.

The rhythm guitars sound good but need more presence.

Bass guitar?  I'm sure there's one there but I can't really tell besides the low end seeming to be more than a guitar can make.  You could grunge it up more, and take some low end from the guitars to help make it more in-the-mix.  

In fact, the whole mix sounds uncompressed.  The snare has no sense of room.

The lead guitar tone around 2:34 is gross.

Singing is meh.  I'd either bury it in FX, autotune, or make him retake it.  He sounds bored.  More emotion!

Performance-wise it sounded good, besides the clean vox.  The problems I'm pointing out are me being picky.  The mix is really about 75%-80% there, the balance is mostly right but the lack of compression lets things get away.

"Are there any good drum machine programs that are good for extreme metal?","If you're thinking of just the basic MIDI drums, the RSE starting from Guitar Pro 5  actually sounds remotely like real drums. If it was all MIDI sounding that would truly be awful.

[Here's one of my demo tracks that I consider ""done""](http://apathybm.bandcamp.com/track/apathy-demo) (except for single tracked guitar). There's a clean section about 3:00 in where you can hear the drums loud and clear.

I just got around to adding bass on everything so other songs needs to be remixed which has been a nightmare. 

Disclaimer: Bandcamp automatically reduces the volume of the music you upload, and my music is already mixed to be ""Anti-Loudness"" so be wary of leaving your volume too high. 

It doesn't apply to this track but generally the bass drum has issues coming out on blast beats, but this would be solved by tracking it separately from the snare and cymbals. That's too much work for a demo though.

EDIT: Second track is done too"

Does GP5 allow wave exports ? Do you have to mix all drums at once ?

If that's the song you're looking for, why not, but I don't see how ""real"" drum softwares won't do better than that. But sure I get that this is a demo and you don't want to spend that much time on it. But I'm sure once you try Superior Drummer for instance, you won't go back to RSE.

"Are there any good drum machine programs that are good for extreme metal?","Thanks.

&gt;I'm not at all into black metal, for all I know you guys have weird standards in terms of sound quality

For starters, this is ONLY for demos, I 100% want to have a real drummer for any serious release.

&gt;Does GP5 allow wave exports ? Do you have to mix all drums at once ?

It only exports MIDI. I work around this by capturing my stereo mix using Audacity. I could have separate tracks for Bass, Snare, and cymbal, but that defeats the purpose of using Guitar Pro, which is convenience.

As oppose to dedicated drum software, I write all of my music (riffs, bass) in GP and the interface is very convenient for writing a drum track as well. My main reason for using GP is that I don't want to do a lot of work when my music is still in the demo stage. Like all people, I'd rather have a real drummer! Or learn drums myself when I can afford a kit."

"How much have you paid to be recorded?","I wanted to try and figure out an average rate to record a few songs. My brother's band paid $250 for 1 song but that included everything, including pressing a few CD copies. What have you paid?"
"How much have you paid to be recorded?","I think it likely depends quite a bit on where you are located and the studio ( equipment and experience with similar bands ).

I think generally it seems to me that for a ""decent"" product I expect around $200 / song. That would be recording, mixing and maybe light mastering. Full-on mastering is a whole different beast that traditionally costs more and uses different equipment than a standard recording studio will have - though these days you can frequently get a pretty good master by just using things like Ozone.

I would recommend saving up and doing your research on the studios you're looking into. In my opinion, it's a complete waste to spend any time and money on a cheaper option if you dislike the end product. If you're not happy with it and proud of it, then it will be difficult for you to sell it to other people."
"How much have you paid to be recorded?","You really should just call local places and ask about their rates and what all is involved.  Definitely shop around.  Ask local bands where they have gone and what their experience was like.  Do not overlook places because they have non-metal bands in their client list.

Many pro studios where you go in, set up your gear and record and mix charge per hour.  But are flexible to alter pricing if you want to reserve an entire week/month or however long you need.  (you can do this step yourself actually...but it's much less of a headache to simply go to a studio imo.  They are pros at it, and experienced and unless you are too...you wouldn't be asking this).  Economically and logistically speaking it's best to go into this with 3-4 or more songs.  It's a waste of time to go in, set up gear, record and mix, and break down after just 1 song.  Drums are time consuming and more involved to set up and mic properly.  Ideally you want to get all the songs done in one session for the sake of the drums alone.

Most mastering houses charge per song.  With limits based on the length of the song.  For example if you send them a 16 minute song then they'll up the price.  Definitely shop around for mastering.  Listen to their samples.  Some even master one of your songs cheaper so you can get a feel for what the end product will be.

From there you can pick a service that will follow through with pressing and all that.  Or you can DIY.  I've always done pressing myself.  Basically after I get mailed the masters I send it to a pressing house to make the CD or record.  If you are pressing records expect a 3-4 month lead time.

There's also studios that do the entire run from recording to mixing to mastering.  IDK what their rates would be like but I expect it would be equivalent to...how good their service is, and how much of their time you are buying.

FWIW my last 13 track album I spent about $700 overall.  3 other band mates also dropped about as much money too, we tried to split it up comfortably.  That covered recording in the studio, mixing in the same studio.  Mastering somewhere else.  Pressing onto CD (qty300) somewhere else with a digi pack that had 6 pages of sleeve art (3 inside, 3 outside).  I wanted to go with a digi pack that only had one panel, but the other dudes voted for 2 panel so there's that."
"How much have you paid to be recorded?","All depends on the studio. My band recorded our three song demo for $375. $125 per song. That was only for recording, mixing and mastering. We did the rest ourselves. There is another studio around here that I know the guy charges $500 per song. He has a much bigger studio with bigger equipment and I think that includes sending it to discmasters for print."
"How much have you paid to be recorded?","Low rates I've seen are around $75 per song with as high as going about $500 or $1000 for high-end studios. "
"How much have you paid to be recorded?","We just released our 11 track full length. This one cost altogether $5000, including mastering. We pressed ourselves. Bit on the pricey side, but for 12 days in a high-end studio, with mastering, it's worth it. We recorded at a studio many bands that have influenced us have been recorded, and we got what we payed for. That was mostly producer time in that figure as well. He improved our sound, made changes to the music here or there, and added sounds to improve it and make it feel like a full album. We also got to record through some badass, and for my amp at least, rare equipment. We wouldn't have thought to use an accordion in a song either, that's for sure!"

"tips for an aspiring vocalist? (death metal, black metal, grindcore)","Hey guys, how's it going?

So I've been practicing vocals for quite some time, mostly singing along in the car to loud music, and whatnot. Recently I joined a band and while my screaming sounds pretty good on amp, it doesn't sound that great when I record it (through a voicelive play). 

I'm curious how to improve my voice, as there aren't very many good tips and tricks online for more heavy death metal. Dying Fetus, Pig destroyer, Arch Enemy and Chthonic are some huge influences on the sound I'm going for.

Alternatively, does anyone else have problems getting their recordings not sounding like PA? Am I just not great, and masking my voice through a shitty mic? 

I definitely want to get better.

Thanks in advance!"
"tips for an aspiring vocalist? (death metal, black metal, grindcore)","Basically put, most vocals (screams included) are going to sound like shit without proper processing. 

When I record vocals, you have to have a good mic (condenser is my preferred), a good room to dampen the excess reverb, and multiple takes to get the correct sound. On top of that, you'll want slight compression to keep your vocals more even in wave form. You'll correct the rest later.

Then you'll want to further compress, at a higher ratio 8:1 to 16:1 (tweak to your preference) and bounce the track through. Then to give it further volume you'll need to eq it. This will be a whole other story. Cutting low ends (30hz and below), and the far high end (20k plus isn't needed), while boosting mid to high-lows. Somewhere between 250 to 500hz.

Then slight room verb to fill it up some more, and some slight chorus. Maximize, and compress, and presto. Vocals. 

Oh, and lest I forget the most important part. DON'T CLIP (when the audio level goes above 0db). Clipping does not sound good under any circumstances, and will render that entire take useless. 

So long story short, it's not as simple as plugging in and screaming. There are a ton of factors that go into it.

Feel free to message me with any questions. "
"tips for an aspiring vocalist? (death metal, black metal, grindcore)","so if I've already recorded through audacity is there any way I can modify the present vocals to sound good? "
"tips for an aspiring vocalist? (death metal, black metal, grindcore)","As long as you didn't clip. Audacity should have a compressor built in. Look up a tutorial online for it. "
"tips for an aspiring vocalist? (death metal, black metal, grindcore)","Could you give any examples of your vocals, as well as a complete rundown of your signal chain and rig?

"tips for an aspiring vocalist? (death metal, black metal, grindcore)","I'm a huge noob, I'm afraid I don't recognize most that terminology ^^;

The mic is plugged into the voicelive which is connected to a peavey 2x14(?) amp, the recordings are done via usb. "
"tips for an aspiring vocalist? (death metal, black metal, grindcore)","The signal chain is basically everything you use from the instrument to what's recording, so essentially that was mostly what i needed to know. If you can share the mic model, that would be helpful too.

That said, i think the main issue here is using the peavey amp as a recording interface. I'm going to assume it's a guitar amp with a usb output that you hook to your computer to record. The problem here is that amps with these features need to simulate being played through cabinet speakers, so that someone recording guitar via usb doesn't need to mic up their amp. Your setup now theoretically is your voice to mic, through voicelive(negligible), through an amp (colors the signal), out through cabinet speaker (simulated, also colors), back through a mic (also simulated and colors), and then to your computer. Vocals need to be as direct as possible when recorded. The signal chain should essentially be your voice, to a mic, through a recording interface, to the computer. Unless your voicelive has a usb feature, or the peavy has a bypass feature, you're going to be stuck with a PA sound issue until you upgrade to an interface.

As for tips on singing, giving an example of what you can do would be helpful in critiquing and possibly pointing you in a right direction. Otherwise the best i could do is explaining how i, as an amateur, approach singing and recording metal vocals, which may not be relevant to your style."

"Can anyone teach me how to drums?","This is a really difficult question to answer. Many genres differ in their approach to playing drums, so how you approach writing parts depends on what's your style of music. In addition, drums rely heavily on feeling out the groove, so if you're relying on formulaic patterns, things might not work out so well. I'll try my best to give some general tips to get started.

First, if you have absolutely no clue, start from the beginning and learn rock drumming and rock groves. The basic [rock groove](http://www.drumitinaminute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/straight-8th-rock-groove-a-and-b-combo.png) is just straight 8th note on the high hat, kick on 1, 3, &amp;(3), and snare on 2 and 4. This demonstrates some general principals of drumming:

* The hi-hat maintains a constant beat that acts as a sort of backbone to the groove, similar to a metronome. We will call this the power hand. You will find that modifying the rhythm (quarter notes, 16th, triplets, etc.) can drastically change how we perceive the groove.

* The kick and snare play out the groove, acting as counter points. The kick moves the rhythm, the snare emphasizes (notice the accent over 2 and 4)

* The groove can be written out into 3 voices corresponding to each drum piece, and can be assigned a limb to play each part. This is important when writing out drum parts. Drum parts stop looking like a cluster fuck when you realize what limb corresponds to what piece, and then breakdown into individual voices. I find when i'm writing a drum part, i'll start with the power hand part (usually laying down a straight 8th/16th note on hi-hat/ride), followed by placing where i want the snare to accent the groove, and then finally adding kick in relation to the snare.

After understanding the basics and applying to [similar grooves](http://0.tqn.com/d/np/drums/9781580628860_0150_002.jpg), start acquiring a repertoire of other well known grooves. Having an arsenal of rhythms that you understand can act as a starting point which you can tweak until it fits the song. In terms of metal, you should definitely have the [skank beat (or polka beat)](http://www.tigerbill.com/graphics/polka1.gif) and [blast beat](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/BlastBeatPattern1.jpg) down. [George Kollias has a good demonstration on these two grooves](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDEA9Jy5VcA). Pay attention at the end when he takes his right hand out from playing hi-hat. Usually, since a straight blast beat can be repetitive and boring, drummers will remove the power hand from the hi-hat/ride and play a groove using other cymbals. This is one of the ways that you can incorporate crash cymbals into a song.

I will emphasize again that your best bet for learning is to understand basic patterns, and use them as a basis for your drum parts. Seeing how you're using guitar pro, just grab some drum tabs from a song you like, and just copy and paste. I could try and go over more on cymbals and fills if you'd like, but this is already becoming a wall of text of me blabbering, so i'll leave this for now. "
"Can anyone teach me how to drums?","I play guitar and bass, and this makes drums make more sense to me. Thanks man!"
"Can anyone teach me how to drums?","Some very common things: put the crash on the first beat of your pattern/riff, ride/hats/other cymbal on ever other quarter note or half note in a bar, snare on the second and fourth beat of each bar (or third of each bar for half tempo), every ""and"" (1 AND, 2 AND, 3 AND, 4 AND) for double tempo, and the kick drum following along with what the guitar bass is doing (either every single note or only to reinforce the important beats of the riff). Hope that helps you a bit. "
"Can anyone teach me how to drums?","[deleted]"
"Can anyone teach me how to drums?","I actually memorized some guitar hero patters on the drums.  They sounded okay on the real drums and people actually thought I knew how to play.  "
"Can anyone teach me how to drums?","Its potentially acceptable to do anything that requires four or less limbs, but bear in mind the endurance of the drummer. Sure its possible to do a 16th note blast beat at 280 bpm, but how long could an actual person keep that up? The sky is the limit when creating new and interesting drum parts. Do anything that sounds good, as long as its possible its valid. "
"Can anyone teach me how to drums?","I start out with a pretty simple approach when writing drums. I start with the kick, pretty much following the riff pretty tightly. Next I place the snare somewhere in the bar that fits the riff. The placement of the snare has a lot to do with the feel of the riff. Next I add whatever cymbal suits - the placement of these also change the feel of the riff, like the snare. Having a half-time snare (on beat 3) and half-time cymbals (beats 1 and 3) make it feel much different than cymbals every beat and a snare on beat 3, let alone on 2 and 4. Experiment with this - because why not?

Once I have this basic version of a drum track down - a draft, if you will - I listen to it in context and see where I can take it. The kick doesn't have to follow the riff - you can take kick hits out or add even more if you need. You can add more cymbals, add ghost notes on the snare and cymbals, and add fills. 

I find building from the ground up like this helps a lot more with drum tracks, as trying to tackle the entire drum kit at once can feel a bit daunting. 

Hope it helps man! "

"I tried to go for something with much rawer sounding drums rather than super polished and produced. What do you guys think?","this sounds solid dude. the riffs around 1:26 are pretty ridiculous. the drums sound good, but as UltimateSasquatch said, throw some randomness into those drums. in my experience, the trick to programming more ""human"" sounding drums is to go through your midi clips and slide each MIDI trigger/one shot drum sample slightly to the left or right (earlier or later) from the line on the grid. if you do this tactfully, it would help cut down the roboticness of the 100% perfectly on the grid drums that you currently have (that's my first impression). give it a try man.. i think it could really give the track some more life. also mess with the velocities of a select few of those one shot drum samples.. def gives it a bit more variation.

this is sweet though dude, definitely keep working on your drum programming skills. there might come a day where you break off from metal (as i did) and delve into some more trippy production stuff. these are really great skills to have."
"I tried to go for something with much rawer sounding drums rather than super polished and produced. What do you guys think?","Thanks for the feedback! I usually mess with the velocities of the drum notes but mostly when I'm programming fills, blast beats, or repeated cymbal hits so maybe I'll try that trick with the main kick and snare parts as well as moving drums notes over a bit in one direction or the other."

"I tried to go for something with much rawer sounding drums rather than super polished and produced. What do you guys think?","Your tone is getting better but still needs work. Are you high-shelving one of the guitars? One of them should sound really scratchy if you were to play it alone. The drums sound way cooler but you should also try randomizing them."
"I tried to go for something with much rawer sounding drums rather than super polished and produced. What do you guys think?","I am high shelving them, I thought that was standard practice and I'm not a huge fan of the how the guitars sound with the higher frequencies left alone.

"any bands in NW Arkansas?","Hey metalheads,

I've been doing metal vocals for a few years, and have learned a lot, as well as nearly perfected my craft.  I still have a lot to learn, and have many ways in which I can grow.  One of the ways I wish to grow is by actually joining a band, instead of simply doing covers to other bands that I like.  I'll be willing to travel a little (I don't want to go out of state just to rehearse and/or hang, but i would be willing to go as far as rogers or maybe bentonville).  I currently am residing in fayetteville, so if you are nearby, definitely let me know here.

from what others have told me, from hearing me sing, they say that I sound EXACTLY like Randy Blythe from Lamb of God.  I suppose that is a good thing, but I would like to have my own sound.  Which is why I would like to find a group of guys/girls who play metal, and are in need of a vocalist.  This way I can grow more, and begin to develop my own personal sound.

Thanks for reading, and i'll see you all in hell."

"How important are rhyming lyrics to you?","I recently started writing my own music, and I was wondering how much you guys worry about making your lyrics rhyme. Do any of you just not rhyme?"
"How important are rhyming lyrics to you?","It's not the most important thing in the world to me to have my lyrics rhyme, but it makes them easier for me to remember if they do.  Since I play guitar and do the vocals at the same time, the vocals are the main thing I focus on while performing.  The guitar work is 95% muscle memory and 5% looking at the neck for a position shift more than 3 frets."
"How important are rhyming lyrics to you?","Black metal is mostly prose but I try to aim for something original which is why I go for a bit of poetry. Rhyme is important for creating lyrical flow, but lyricists are too sucked into end rhyme. I have no interest in Dr. Seuss.

Sample of what I think are my best:

Forged in the heart of the *crater*  
The *creator* looks in **dismay**  
Casts **away** the **mistake**  
To be **erased** from memory by  
-Time-
 
----

That nothing really special there. The next quatrain is my personal favorite.

----

As it passes by   
Drenched by the *tears* of the Earth   
The *seared* **flesh** turns to **ash**   
As the life begins to end   

----

The song is called Obsidian Heart, it's about cooling lava representing a dying heart, and I think the lines really come together nicely. My choice in words is not just for the sake of rhyme, but if it creates an appropriate sense of imagery and story telling, then I'll take it to the extreme. It's about telling the story and sending the message. I seek rhymes that feel natural. The converse is also true, I won't avoid generic rhyme if they really fit."
"How important are rhyming lyrics to you?","All the comments here are good, but this one's the best. Good examples, too. Do you have anything recorded? If the music's as good as the lyrics, I'd be all over it. "

"How important are rhyming lyrics to you?","Hey, thanks a lot man. I appreciate it"
"How important are rhyming lyrics to you?","I usually find that rhyming lyrics sound cheesy and juvenile, to be honest. So I (on the rare, rare occasion I actually write lyrics) try to avoid them."
"How important are rhyming lyrics to you?","There's lyrics that don't rhyme just like there's poems that don't rhyme. Totally depends on the situation. Recently I found some really cool lyrics by Dark Fortress - Venereal Dawn (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l5LGrbH-8k). The lyrics are basically poem."
"How important are rhyming lyrics to you?","Don't let this affect what you want to do, but I hate rhyming lyrics in metal, at least simple couplet or ABAB schemes and whatnot. For example I thought Carnifex's new album was really weird just because all of a sudden the vocalist started writing rhyming lyrics. I like good internal rhymes and whatnot, but in metal I'd much rather the vocalist say what he wants to say than force some pop-esque rhyme scheme into his lyrics."
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","I'm going to ask this subreddit my guitar related questions from now on because when I do it in /r/guitar, no one takes me seriously or shits on my question.

I've been using ernie balls for the last year and they are half and half with me. I need to change my strings because I was getting a buzzing noise on the 4th string. The reason? The string was bent at the bottom and I didn't notice until I molested my strings thoroughly. I play in drop C and usually get light top/bottom heavies. I also use a Gio Ibanez something and Epiphone Les Paul. Suggestions for brand or gauges?"
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","10-52 D'Addarios. They feel a lot better to me than EBs, they're inexpensive, and they last a long time."
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","I use 10-52 GHS boomers. I like em, but that's just, like, my opinion man.  "
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","You have good taste in strings."
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","Thank you kind sir. I honestly started using them long ago during a Zakk Wylde phase I went through and they just stuck. "
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","D'Addario for life"
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","I've been using them exclusively since I was about 19. Nothing else touches my babies."
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","I usually stick with the cobalt 'Not Even Slinky'. It has the lowest gauge of the 6 string packs, which i prefer in my guitars for high tension, regardless of tuning. It might just be me bullshitting, but i use cobalt because it doesn't have that crisp high end ring you get from picking. Could be from the strings' lacking of the polished finish, similar to how cymbals sound different depending on how they were finished; but again, I could be talking out my ass right now.

You can also try mix and matching different packs if you can spend the money and don't mind having strings sitting around. I once used the lower gauge of the 7string pack with another heavy gauge set just to see if my guitar could comfortably go down to drop A, which worked fine. However at that point i was pretty much stuck at tuning below D standard to reduce strain on the neck, so keep that in mind if you like to move your tuning around."
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","Doesn't sound like bullshit, I thought the cobalts had different tone too.

Similar to you I found there was less in the higher frequencies.  I didn't like them though because they sounded a little too dead to me."
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","Those cobalts sound cool but they oxidize so much faster. You're going to run into a lot of rust"
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","D'Addario Jazz Light pro-steels. Those things are amazing and have great tension. I can go baritone on my 25.5"" strat easily, so Drop C shouldn't be a problem. Personally I just play it in D#"
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","I play .09-42 Rotosounds on my Les Paul in Eb

I generally just roll with whatever sounds nice and adjust my action accordingly... With a bit of common sense, of course."
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","I just got d'addario 10's with a wound g and they're excellent. It knocked out all the intonation and tuning problems I've been having on the g string and I didn't even get it set up. I also love Dunlop strings and they're cheap as fuck"
"I need new strings, any suggestions?","Everyones saying D'darios, but there are a few i prefer. Id really recommend Dunlop Heavy Cores, they break in quick but stay in tune for ages."

"high output pickup guitar through pod hd pro clean tones always come out a little crunchy, never shimmery. please help.","A hot pickup is going to hit the preamp harder and may cause a little distortion. If you are DI'ing for recording, check settings and make sure the gain is low in the preamp as well as the channel volume. Use the master to increase overall volume for your setting and save it that way. It will take some tweaking to get volumes balanced between the dirty and clean tones. If you are running this live into an amp, there are a few ways to set it up. If you run the HD into the standard input, the HD's signal will be amplified by the amps preamp an will increase the gain structure, possibly causing unwanted distortion. Tweaking this setup like the DI setup will be required. You can also plug it into the effects loop like a standard pedal. The preamp will color your tone, you can use your amps channels, but the HD's dirty tones will sound weird in this setup. If you bypass the amps pre by plugging into the HD, and running that into the effects loop return on the amp, your tones will be cleaner since you have removed a massive gain stage from the setup. This however doesn't let you use the amps channels and is only using the power amp stage of the amplifier to up the output to the speakers. Try all 3 and see what you like."

"high output pickup guitar through pod hd pro clean tones always come out a little crunchy, never shimmery. please help.","Use the pad on the HD Pro. It's the third button at the bottom below the mic power/high pass filter buttons. Also remember that the HD Pro by default sets itself to +18db input volume. You can change those settings on your computer's audio device setup tab. Also bear in mind that compressors, any drive at all, and the master volume on the POD amps all add a little distortion. Try fiddling with the deep fx parameters to turn those things down as much as possible, and compensate with more volume on the amp. Try [watching this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYMYbnQ_U2o) and see if you can get an approximately similar tone."

Would you care to elaborate on your settings ? How did you record the guitars, what are the drums ? I'd love to be able to have that kind of song, even if it's a bit too ""modern"" and ""polished"" for my taste, it's very professional."
"I'm working on an 8-string cover of Megadeth's ""Sweating Bullets""! Got an instrumental demo uploaded! CC Appreciated! (Vocals coming soon!)","Sure thing!  I use Sony Acid for my DAW, since it's super easy to use, and has great inline midi editing.  For the drums, I use Superior Drummer with Metal Foundry.  I use Frederik from Meshuggah's ""Bleed"" preset kit as a starting point, and tweaked it a bit here and there.  I programmed the drum midi tracks by hand, and discovered that this song would be a pain in the ass to play live, lol.

The guitars were all recorded using a Line 6 POD HD with custom tones I made, using the Treadplate amp.  I could go more in depth as to my actual chain if you'd like, since it's tad complicated.

As for the tracking, there are 2 hard panned guitar tracks where I'm playing the lower register of my 8-string (Ibanez RGA8 with an 808x in the bridge position), then 2 guitar tracks playing an octave higher, each panned 50% to either the left or right.

For mastering, I have the final mix running through the fab filter limiter VST, with a 3.0 dB boost, and the ""metal - natural loudness"" preset.

I'm happy to share any other info you'd like, cause at one point in time, I was an absolutely terrible producer, but figured out how to make decent recordings using a pretty minimal setup!  (Gaming PC, POD HD, two KRK Rokit 5 studio monitors, some software, and a couple guitars)

These sound like one track in the center to me, and I pretty much guarantee that doubletracking is the biggest single improvement you could make to your sound right now, since your guitar tone and playing sound good already.  That's just my recommendation, but I reeeeeally suggest that you at least try it out :)"

"I've been writing for years and finally decided to start recording. Can someone point me in the direction of a good tutorial or some resources for recording metal guitar?","Well this would all be mixing. Mastering comes later. There's far too much information to explain in a reddit comment. So I'd recommend a good mixing guide like the Systematic Mixing Guide. Should help. Its a lot but there's no point in sloppy mixing "
"I've been writing for years and finally decided to start recording. Can someone point me in the direction of a good tutorial or some resources for recording metal guitar?","Of course. I wouldn't expect anyone to explain the entire mixing/mastering process to me. Thank you for the recommendation though!"
"I've been writing for years and finally decided to start recording. Can someone point me in the direction of a good tutorial or some resources for recording metal guitar?","The sound is good, it's just the mixing (mostly) that needs work. I think the guitars are perfect.

For the drums, humanization is going to be a big thing. Try and get acoustic samples, a few different hits of each drum piece. I know there are programs that allow you to just add multiple samples to one slot/bus, and randomize it for you, but its almost always better when done by hand. However, you may randomize the velocity and the pitch by a small percentage automatically if you can.

Once you've got some good samples and tones, the next step is mixing. It's tempting to want to pump everything up and make everything equally audible, but you're probably gonna want to reduce the volume of the cymbals and snare. If you're still interested in having a loud sounding drum set, you can worry about side-chaining, but that honestly might have to come later after you get good producing chops first. Also don't be afraid to throw some washy reverb out there with a low cut or high boost on the west signal, just keep it all quiet as to not overwhelm the rest of the sound.

After that is mastering. There are tons of tricks out there to get a better sound: the most popular probably being multi-band compression, and limiting. Another thing you can do is duplicate the whole track and give it a hard reverb again, to the point where the wet signal is barely recognizable from the dry, but then gut a lot of the frequencies from that and throw it waaayy in the back. It will give it some bounciness and air though. A good poor man's multi-compressor is, again, duplicate the track a couple times, and isolate different frequency ranges for each duplication. Then compress, amplify, distort, reverberate, or fuck up any of these frequencies that you want. Even something as stupidly simple as CamelPhat Distortion is a great VST for this. I know there's a lot more to mastering that I'm missing out on so I'll leave it at that."
"I've been writing for years and finally decided to start recording.

"I wrote/recorded this. First time using actual mastering software (Izotope Ozone). Any recommendations?","I like it a lot and the mix is quite good.

"I wrote/recorded this. First time using actual mastering software (Izotope Ozone). Any recommendations?","Okay here's the dirt (/u/hs94 also): 

AMP (the x50 is just a 5150 sim, so roughly the same would apply to the Nick Crow 7170 I think): Red channel, pre gain 2, low 2.5, mid 8, treble 8, post gain 3.25, low end 6, presence 9, impulse is guitarhack666 (comes with the X50) with length/movement set to 100%. Red mod is not turned on. Tubes are 6L6 and bias is at 12 o'clock.

STOMP: Overdrive 0, balance 3 o'clock, tone 3 o'clock.

EQ: -5db smallish bell at 52 hz to make room for kick (just in case anything makes it past the high pass filter); high pass/low pass to taste (I have it at 65 and 9500 hz, respectively), broad 3db cut at 275, narrow boost of 1.5 db at 1189 (just enough to be heard in the mix), -4db at 3777 to make room for kick click. 

OTHER STUFF: 3.5 db of SSL 4000 saturation from the Slate VCC. 

I'm using an LTD 7-string with EMG actives. :) 

As for the rest of my mix, my bass is a turd, so I spent a lot of time manually riding the volume and cutting strategically to make the kick heard. Drums are the Metal Machine EZX. I did very little to the individual kit pieces except hollowing out the toms, cutting the sustain and boosting the attack of the kick with a transient designer and scooping out a lot around 200hz, and put a lot of Slate VCC and about 2db worth of the Slate VBC on the drum bus. Also a parallel compression bus to add some snap, and barely enough of the room mic to add some weight to the toms, snare, and overheads. No kick bleed except a teeny bit for the snare bottom and overhead mics.

Let me know if you guys have any other questions, and thanks again! I'm still not satisfied with the kick-bass balance, but that's because I'm using a total cheapo bass with huge resonant nodes haha."
"I wrote/recorded this. First time using actual mastering software (Izotope Ozone). Any recommendations?","The intro was painful. But the rest of the song blew me out of my chair. That was incredible. I would recommend cutting out the intro, at least until the part where multiple guitars come in. Good freaking job. "

"I wrote/recorded this. First time using actual mastering software (Izotope Ozone). Any recommendations?","Nice dude. Mix sounded pretty good, well done!"
"I wrote/recorded this. First time using actual mastering software (Izotope Ozone). Any recommendations?","Okay, how the hell did you record the acoustic guitars? Good sound, but like you said the bass's presence is too low. "
"I wrote/recorded this. First time using actual mastering software (Izotope Ozone). Any recommendations?","In my apartment with a cheap, cheap MXL 991 microphone haha. High pass filter to cut out the boominess and I equalized the volume of each note to within an inch of its life manually. A few standard cuts around 250 to cut a bit of mud and around 700 hz to cut the boxiness. I actually cleaned the acoustic neck about a month ago with oil soap and forgot to put lemon oil back on so the neck was super dry, which made the tone weird. I'm cheap so I refused to buy new strings haha. Then I just added a touch (1-3 db max) of compression, some saturation, and reverb.

As for the bass, yeah it's a Sterling Sub bass. I had the nut widened and tuned it to BEAD, so there are some strange resonances that are deep and thick, which is nice for the lows, but can get obnoxious-sounding. If you EQ them out, though, the bass is awful, so I did the best I could. Looking to sell it and get a schecter 5-string when I have the cash."
"Tips on EQ/shaping settings for recording rhythm (metal) guitar?","I posted a few days ago in regards to tips for EQing and mixing all instruments in a mix (and thankfully I did because I discovered the wonderful Systematic Mixing Guide book through you all!) but I have a more specific question today:

Do any of you have a general setting you try to stay within on EQing rhythm guitars when in studio/recording?  

I know the general tips (ex: turning down the gain to get a better sound after doubling) but what about some specific frequencies I may try to chop out before I hit the record button that I may normally leave on my EQ band during a live session?"
"Tips on EQ/shaping settings for recording rhythm (metal) guitar?","It really depends on your tone and the style. I usually high pass everything below about 80hz (even for my 8 string which uses those frequencies) because it leaves space for the bass and kick drum to breathe and immediately clears up the mix. I boost a small amount around 250hz for some oomph, but not too much.  

The most important part for me is a large cut around 800 hz, which is a very boomy and resonating frequency and for me immediately makes my tone sound cleaner. Then I usually boost anywhere from 1.4k-2k (depending on my tuning) which helps with that percussive, well-defined sort of sound on the low strings.

I usually roll off above 5-6k because none of those frequencies add anything to guitar and just take up the space of the drum overheads.

Usually I put the high pass filter before my amp but the rest after the amp and let the amp primarily shape the tone. The EQ is just for chiseling the sound a little further. "
"Tips on EQ/shaping settings for recording rhythm (metal) guitar?","Great tips man!  I'll implement these next time I'm in session.

Thanks for all of you guys' help."
"Tips on EQ/shaping settings for recording rhythm (metal) guitar?","I wouldn't EQ at all during tracking. After tracking, I'll high and low pass to ensure there's nothing unnecessary at the extremes, but anything else is just done to either tame excessive frequencies or make space for other instruments. A good spectrum analyser will show what needs to be done there."
"Tips on EQ/shaping settings for recording rhythm (metal) guitar?","In my experience, I find that I like a lot less midrange in my guitars when recording compared to when I'm jamming with a full band. Depending on what you are playing through, you can usually get away with a fairly healthy scoop and still have enough mids to cut through the mix properly. Before you go messing around with your amp settings though, try fooling around with mic placement. Different positions can produce radically different tones. Try getting as close to your ideal sound with just the mic alone and then you can mess with EQ on the amp and in your DAW."
"Tips on EQ/shaping settings for recording rhythm (metal) guitar?","How are you going to mix your tracks? Will you double track the guitars and hard pan the ""typical"" way? Then make sure you offset their EQ by just a bit so both guitars aren't 100% bleeding into each other.

Now for guitar tone, you can choose to scoop your mids in typical fashion. However, what this will inevitably do is boost your bass and treble (it's equivalent since you basically have to raise the volume after scooping), which means your guitar will bleed into the bass region. Which means your track will have minimal bass since you'll have to kick the bass drum up to compensate as well.

My personal approach uses my own style. I like mids in my guitar and I like having bass which I use it to create harmonies. What I do is mid boost my guitar, single track, and soft pan my guitar and bass to opposite sides (Guitar R, Bass L, 20%). 

EDIT: For actual frequencies, I'll have my main guitar boosted around 1500 Hz. If I add a second guitar, I'll boost around 1000 Hz, since my vocals are higher frequency and I don't want to bleed into that. Bass track I boost around 500, bass drum around 300 to give everything enough space"

We're releasing our debut album ""Simulacra"" this Sunday but as a treat, here is the entire album streaming live on Sputnik right now! Take a listen and tell me what you think r/metalmusicians!","That was stunning! Amazing composition and some lovely variation and dynamics. I also wanted to throw in a small comment to tip my hat to the punchy but still wonderfully natural drum sound. 

The one thing, if I'm being massively critical and considering my personal tastes above what you've actually achieved here, is that I prefer clean vocals with a bit more - I dunno - something... I would use the word ""pizzazz""... Probably my love of vocals in a slightly higher register but, whatever, I'm being picky just to give you my thoughts.

In any case, I loved it. Fantastic piece of work. You have another fan. Thank you for sharing and wishing you and the others good things after the release."

"Any vocalists have some tips for singing with power in the passaggio?","I have absolutely no vocal training whatsoever, and I'm pretty much just training myself through car singing. I'm trying to extend my range, but my voice often cracks around G4. My head voice is weak, so you can definitely tell where the break is. Any way to make the head voice stronger and blend them more smoothly?

Also I'm only 18, so my voice is probably still changing."
"Any vocalists have some tips for singing with power in the passaggio?","It's a boring answer, but it's all practice. Your voice is made up of muscles. The more you work out these muscles (properly, mind you - don't strain!), the more elastic and responsive they become.

In my experience, the best way to gain range is a three-pronged approach. First, do 10-15min of scales and thirds, up and down, moving up and down keys chromatically. PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR MUSCULATURE! You must, MUST be accurate in every note before you move on. 

Next, break up the boring scales by singing a song you like, that's relatively easy to sing. Maybe just on the CUSP of your range. Finally, back to scales, then a few octaves (again ACCURACY), then try a song that's just a bit out of your range. 

Go slow, and work your way up. It's a process that takes a while. People don't turn into swollen monsters after one week in the gym, and you won't turn into Bruce or Dio after one week either. Sing everywhere, all the time. Take it slow, work your way up, and listen to your body.

Don't forget to cool down as well!"

Could you elaborate on this? What should a learning vocalist be looking out for, specifically?"
"Any vocalists have some tips for singing with power in the passaggio?","Sure. As you move through the scale, make a mental note of the musculature of your throat at the pitch you're on. This will slightly change based on your pitch. Higher notes will make the throat constrict tighter, and lower notes will open the throat. However, no two positions will ever be exactly the same. 

If you pay attention to what, say a G# feels like in your throat, you'll have an easier time recalling that position when you're singing. Often times we're singing at shitty dive bars with terrible monitoring, right? :-) 

If you can rely on your muscle memory to tell you if you're on the correct pitch ALONG with hearing the note, you'll be a much more accurate singer.

"Dethklok: Briefcase Full of Guts Cover / Tell me what you think","It sounds like you're well on your way but there's a lot to work on. 

1. It sounded like you were in standard or maybe D standard. Just wanted to make sure you knew that all of Dethklok's stuff is in C standard, which is two whole steps down.

2. You're bass was a bit off beat, kinda lagged behind the guitars. Technique wise it sounded pretty solid though. 

3. The tone was a bit weak overall. May I ask what your set up is? 

4. I think your tempo was a little slower than the original song, but I could understand that if you're a beginner. And in that regard you actually did pretty well. 

Other than these things, of course you just need vocals and drums and it'll be killer! Your technique is good enough that I can tell you can play it well. So you're definitely well on your way. "

I use Line 6 Spider 4 amp on the Slipknot setting and a Peavey Max 115 bass amp.  The bass is ibanez Gio and the guitar is Schekter Diamond series.  I turned the tone setting to 100%, but I agree, it's still lacking.  I don't know what more it needs/how to fix it though.  I don't have an interface between the amp and the software though.  I just have a 3.5 mm jack going from the headphone port on the amp to the computer and record silently.    

I think to solve tempo I maybe just need a metronome.  Thanks for you help"
"Dethklok: Briefcase Full of Guts Cover / Tell me what you think","Metronome will definitely help, I never record without one. DI'ing is definitely the reason for your tone. Maybe try blasting your amp a little more?

I could tell that was a Line 6 Spider, I used to own one myself and I used it for my first album. To me it was really lacking as far as power output though. It's great to fuck around and practice on but recording is another story. I moved to a Fender Mustang and haven't looked back. I'm sure you can make it work. Especially with the Schecter Diamond Series. I actually just pawned mine off earlier last month (it had been through hell and back with the last owner, I only bought it for $40) so I know you can get a somewhat decent tone out of it. "

"Let's Talk Bass, Week III: Writing Basslines","Last week I said we were going to be doing counterpoint, but then I realized I should probably do something more basic before counterpoint, as not everyone needs to use counterpoint in their music. So this week, we're going to talk about constructing basslines.

In my first post we talked about pedaling and doubling as tools for playing bass, as well as ""color tones"". Now, I'm going to introduce a few more things, then show you how to use them in context.

The first thing I'm going to teach you is the minor pentatonic. This is a very simple and incredibly useful scale in metal. Here is the A minor pentatonic scale tabbed out:

G|------------------

D|-------------5--7---

A|-------5--7---------

E|-5--8---------------

In terms of tonality, this is hitting the minor third, the fourth, the fifth, and the minor seventh, which are very common intervals that sound harmonically good in most contexts. Thus, not only is the pentatonic useful as a standalone melodic tool, but it is also useful for those color tones I talked about before. Also, note that the scale goes both ways. The minor seventh to this scale, for instance, is both up on the 5th fret of the D string, and on the third fret of the E string. Remember that.

A related scale to the minor pentatonic is the blues scale. Here's the blues scale tabbed out, starting at A:

G|------------------

D|----------------5--7---

A|-------5--6--7---------

E|-5--8--------------- 

A very simple addition changes it. Now you have that odd note in there, the tritone, made famous by Black Sabbath in their self-titled song. Though it's called the blues scale, it's also very popular in metal for the simple reason of having the tritone.

One last scale to note is the basic minor. Tabbed out, starting at A:

G|------------------

D|-------------------**5**--**7**---

A|----------**5**--**7**--8---------

E|-**5**--7--**8**--------------- 

This is the full minor scale, and as you can see it has the minor pentatonic within it (bolded). What the minor scale has that the minor pentatonic doesn't are the second and the minor sixth. The sixth being a half-step up from the fifth makes sliding between those notes very easy, which can help writing a bass line.

Now, normally you'll be working with a guitar riff, so I'm going to demonstrate using these with a bass line I wrote based around a guitar part. [This](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38920383/Diabolus.aif) is from a song with my band. Excuse the roughness of the playing and the mix; I recorded it maybe ten minutes ago.

There are three main riffs in this, two of which are mostly doubling the guitar. I'd like to draw attention to the third riff, though, the one under the guitar solo. This draws primarily from the minor pentatonic. I've tabbed it out here (note the tuning is a half-step down):

F#|------------------------------------------------------5--5-5-5-4

C#|----------------5--5-5-5-5-5----5-7--7-7-7-7-5-7--------------5-7

G#|-7--7-7-7-5-7----------------7--------------------------------------

D#|-------------------------------------------


Unlike the example, this is starting on D#. Now, I don't start by going up, but by going down, to the minor seventh on the fifth fret: C#. That creates a simple three note ""down-up-up"" figure going up to the minor third, which I repeat to take us up to the fourth. Now, instead of going for the fifth, I repeat the down-up-up figure to the minor sixth, leaving the minor pentatonic, then playing another three-note pattern to return to the fourth, and back to the root.

Now, note that I did all of this without moving my hand up the neck at all. This is the magic of the pentatonic scale: you have a number of intervals ready to use without moving your hand up and down the neck.

That's about all I can really teach about writing basslines. The rest is up to you. Experiment!

I leave you with a few of my favorite melodic basslines, along with the scales they use.

[Fade to Black](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y90Ir8-VOWE) - Metallica - mostly uses minor + minor pentatonic

[Lines in my Hand](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXd6WqS5vjA) - Opeth - uses some Indian scales

[Limelight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-kQsVk8K4c) - Rush - uses a lot of fifths, fourths, and octaves, as well as the major scale

[Vital Signs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWBPgtB9m3E) Rush - More inverted fifths and major scale.

Thanks for reading. Next time: Counterpoint! (For real this time)"
"Let's Talk Bass, Week III: Writing Basslines","Who better to learn from about writing bass than Steve Harris? [Invaders by Iron Maiden](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63gdZAsl62E) "
"Let's Talk Bass, Week III: Writing Basslines","Thanks for another awesome post! Still trying to wrap my head around the whole fifths, minor sevenths, sixths, etc., but that's my fault for being a noob and not something you should have to cover in this series. 

That said, do you have any resources that you can think of that explain all that in a digestible format? Alternatively, you've definitely got a penchant for explaining stuff so maybe you've got something that you've written on the subject before or feel motivated to whip up a quick little primer on it?"
"Let's Talk Bass, Week III: Writing Basslines","I'll try my hand at explaining intervals right now. Basically, intervals are referred to by numbers which indicate how many steps on a scale they are from the root. For example, a fifth chord (the basis of power chords) is five notes in a major or minor scale from the root. A ""minor interval"" is a half-step smaller than its major counterpart. For example, between a root and its major third, there are four half-steps. A minor third has only 3 half-steps.

Most of the minor intervals appear in the minor scale, specifically the minor third, minor sixth, and minor seventh. The minor second appears in the Phrygian mode only, there is no such thing as a minor fourth, and a minor fifth is usually called a diminished fifth or a tritone.

Also important to note for practical use is that each interval has an inversion. This means that, if you play a note that is an interval *down* from the root (as opposed to up from the root), then you are playing that interval's inversion, which can be used to give a similar but not quite the same feel to a passage. For example, a fifth on the bass guitar (in standard) is two frets up on the next-higher string. A fourth is on the same fret, next-higher string. But on the same fret on the next-*lower* string, a fourth down, you will be playing the fifth, just lower.

As I said before, most of the intervals you'll find useful for metal are in the minor pentatonic scale. Play around with them some."
"Let's Talk Bass, Week III: Writing Basslines","Thanks! That helps. The relative location of the intervals definitely helps to explain why those things sounded right together even before I knew of their actual relationship.

I feel like I'm on the precipice of understanding...but just trying to find that thing that makes it really ""click"" and actually make sense fully. Having memory problems makes it much more difficult to rely on rote memorization so I need to find that tipping point that makes it click and lets my brain think of it naturally without having to exactly remember the relationships but to feel them...if that makes any sense

Anywho, thanks again and I look forward to your next post!"
"Let's Talk Bass, Week III: Writing Basslines","Learning the intervals is probably going to be more muscle memory, which I think is different neurologically from regular memory. But best of luck to you regardless."

"r/metalmusicians, I made some progressive death metal riffs. Shakespeare can be a brutal inspiration...","My name suggests nothing more than woogetry suggests.

I'm sorry, I'm woogetry but my real name is Sunshine. I would very much like to know more about mixing and what I did wrong.

The drums are too loud. Not by much, but they are. They need to come down by about -2dB I would say. The ""click"" of the kick drum is drowning out the guitars. The guitars have too much hair/sizzle on them (treble.) I understand that tone is very subjective and maybe this is just how you like your sound, but you need to have enough mid-range clarity, punch and bark in your tone so that people can clearly hear what notes and chords you are playing. Keep in mind that the guitar is fundamentally a mid-range instrument. You're obviously a very tight player so it would only help to accentuate that by making your guitar sound as clear as possible. 

Typically when you record you should turn your gain down a bit, vs. when you are jamming or just playing by yourself. Most microphones, especially dynamic ones (for ex. Shure SM57) impart natural compression to the signal, so if your guitar tone is already super gainy coming out of the amp, the mic will just add to that and you end up with gutless mush. I'm not saying your tone is gutless mush because it isn't really, but it's just an example. My favourite trick for getting a good tone in the mics is a simple one: put your face right in front of the speaker and play. If it doesn't sound good there, then it will not sound good to the microphone.

As for using the same guitar for all the tracks, it's not a problem, I do it all the time. You just have to either EQ the tracks slightly differently so that they each shine through, or EQ your amp differently when you record so that they don't conflict with each other. For rhythm tracks you want a little more low end and some nice crispness, but a little bit less mid-range. Then for any lead phrasing / solos, you want less low end, more mid range, and more upper-mid range, so they punch through. It can be a bit of a balancing act and it's tricky to describe it with words. But basically you want to have each section of your song (drums, bass, rhythm guitars, lead guitars, etc.) occupying its own portion of the frequency spectrum so they are not fighting each other for space in the sound. 

Another trick I like doing is using track automation to alter the EQ of various tracks on the fly as the song is playing. So let's say you have a solo, right when it kicks in, do an automated EQ on the rhythm guitars to drop out some mid-range (for ex., -2dB @ 750Hz) so the solo has more room to breathe. The instant the solo is done, the rhythm guitars go back up +2dB again so you never even notice the change. Sometimes very small changes like this can make or break a mix. Think of it like the icing on a cake.

This is the first time I've ever put my things out there...here in the vast world of the internet. I should probably get used to assholes. That sounds gross. 

Anyway, I never thought about being right in front of the amp to adjust tone...makes sense. I've always had a hard time finding the right tone I like so I'm sure that'll help! It just so happens I was using an SM57 for that recording! and my gain was up a lot :( damn. I can hear it now.

I will definitely have to look more into adjusting EQ..I didn't even know I should be doing that. I'm super amateur and I'm slowly learning from reddit people rather than just researching like a normal person. I should try being normal.

Superior Drummer 2.0 and a few years of experience with it. 

Both a 7 and 6 string. Open to using either and open to different tunings. 

As far as my playing, I'm not gonna lie, I'm a bit rusty. Between a full time job and school, my playtime is kind of limited, and a lot of times when I sit down to play, I get kind of discouraged on my current writing and just end up doing something else. I'm a very good rhythm player, and have never been that great at leads, although I can make some and learn some if it's demanded of me.

Really I want to do this as a way to get me back into playing more and writing some fresh stuff. I was in a signed band and toured for a while, but all that ended way back in 2006. I haven't jammed with people in well over a year, and it sucks. I haven't been that inspired with stuff and playing with other people will stir up my creative process. If you want to do all the guitars that's cool with me, and I can make just drum tracks. If you want to split guitars and make drums yourself, or have me make them, I'm cool with that too. Pretty much what I'm saying is I'm down for whatever. Just wanna make some music for the sake of making music. Open to all types of metal, and we can take it any direction. I just want to be doing something.

If you want to hear some stuff I've made and are interested, shoot me a PM and I can send you some tracks via email or something. I have some full songs, and a fuck ton of little snippets of stuff. I'm not that great at the whole mixing and mastering thing, but my stuff doesn't sound like complete shit either. if we actually start taking this somewhere, I'm down to actually have someone do a good job on the recording and know people who could make it happen. "

"Stylistic Help","So, based on the rules sidebar and some of the other stuff I've seen on here, this is a good spot for this (Sorry if its not!! If not, I'll get it down as soon as I can).

Anyway, new band, just getting started (figuring out sound and all that). Our singer is really into metalcore (Issues, WCAR, The Ghost Inside, etc.). I like that stuff, but as the guitarist (and main songwriter, even though I've never written a song in my life.), I like more prog and technical stuff (Trivium, Veil of Maya, Periphery, Animals as Leaders, etc.). I've been trying to find a way to blend them, but I am struggling. Any tips?

Note: I can't play most of the aforementioned prog and tech stuff I mentioned. I just love the sound. "
"Stylistic Help","Practice. Songwriting takes a hell of a lot of practice. initially, don't try to have an objective of blending two styles. I think you would need to learn how to write music, and practice to get your own compositional style, before you would try to blend two very different subgenres"
"Stylistic Help","everything that is wrong with heavy music these days is contained entirely in this post.

but, good luck on your musical travels."
"Stylistic Help","Just write music and see what comes out, finding your style is also about letting your style find you. Do not worry about blending styles, don't even think in terms of styles, just try to write a bunch of songs and get practice songwriting."
"Stylistic Help","Wait, sorry but why are you the ""main songwriter"" if you haven't written a song? Have the others not expressed an interest in writing songs? Not being snarky, just curious how that came about."
"Stylistic Help","I am the most musical person. Everything about it is a first for all of us. The job just kind of fell in my lap."
"Stylistic Help","Fair enough! I would encourage you guys to all give writing a go, however. Some bands do work best with a main songwriter, but others really find their groove through collaboration."
"Stylistic Help","I would love if that would work, but sadly, the other guys don't have any theory training in the least. I generally will write something then show it to them, after which they will give me feedback. "
"Stylistic Help","Knowledge of theory is, in no way, a requirement when it comes to writing music. You just have to stop thinking in terms of theory when you work with them. Apply to the stuff afterwards or personally, but they don't have to know the theory to make the music.

Unless you absolutely want to be the lead writer for the music, then encourage them to write too. "

"What makes this guitar part so compelling?","I've got zero knowledge of music, apart from some guitar chords. I just know what I like or not. I love this song, the change of tempo, everything, but apart from that there is this guitar part I'm wondering about.

Can a musician here listen to a piece and tell me what makes a certain guitar part so compelling? I love this Kathaarian Life Code by Darkthrone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xspdW6GTZo

The part I'm talking about starts at 5:22 to 6:22. Can a musician explain what is going on with the guitar or comment on that part? 

Thanks!"
"What makes this guitar part so compelling?","Ok, there are a few things going on here that make this riff great. 

First of all, let's talk about the scale. This particular riff is in the diminished octatonic scale. What's special about this scale is that it has eight notes, whereas most scales in the Western chromatic system have seven. The diminished octatonic is also one of those scales which, by association, tends to make us in the Western hemisphere think of exotic Eastern imagery, sort of a Lawrence of Arabia feel. It's also very common in Flamenco, and Spain was under Arab occupation for something like ~800 years, leading to considerable overlap in culture and music. 

Now let's talk about motion. This scale has four notes. When I play it on my guitar, which is tuned to D Standard, it looks like this:

D------------------------------------------  
A------------------------------------------  
F------------------------------------------  
C------------------------------------------  
G------------------------------------------  
D--4--3--1----3--0----0--1--3--4-------  

According to the scale we're within, each of these notes are adjacent to one another, except for the transition 3--0. In music theory, we call this a smooth contour. That is, we don't really have notes that are making huge leaps to wildly different pitches. Smooth contour=simplicity, and for many, simplicity=compelling.  

Now about harmony. This riff features power chords, which most consider to be a cornerstone element of metal guitar. A power chord, at its most basic, is a when a given note is played simultaneously with a [Perfect Fifth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4Ah37OU9ps) Often, power chords are played in parallel perfect fifths, which means that for every note on the fretboard I move up or down, my finger that stops the fifth retains the exact same position relative to the root. This riff features a parallel perfect fifth, which, when added to the initial root riff, looks like this:  

D------------------------------------------  
A------------------------------------------  
F------------------------------------------  
C------------------------------------------  
G--6--5--3----5--2----2--3--5--6-------   
D--4--3--1----3--0----0--1--3--4-------  

However, there's a tricky little thing about parallel perfect fifths, and that's that it's really easy for them to sound like shit. The modern Western ear usually prefers that harmonies conform to the denoted scale. In Western scales, *e.g* the Major and natural minor scales, it's literally impossible to play parallel perfect fifths that remain in the scale. At the 4th scale degree, of the major scale (or the second scale degree of the minor scale), a parallel perfect fifth goes sharp, breaking scale conformity. Coming full circle back to the initial paragraph about the current scale we're in, here's another thing that makes this riff special: there ARE certain scales in which parallel perfect fifths remain diatonic and scale-conforming.  
You might recognize the Byzantine scale (sometimes called the Arabian, Jewish, Symmetrical, or Double Harmonic Minor Scale) from virtually any black metal song, or from bands like Nile. Nile will also often use the Hungarian Minor Scale as well as...you guessed it...the Diminished Octanonic scale, which is featured here. All of the above mentioned scales, as well as [probably] a lot more, are able to accommodate parallel perfect fifths without breaking scale conformity. This lends for the ear to subconsciously perceive the riff's harmony as being, for lack of a better word, symmetrical. 


"
"What makes this guitar part so compelling?","I like this breakdown for what it is (about the riff) but I would like to add more.

Perhaps one thing that makes the riff so jarring is its location in the song. The key modulates when it changes to this part at 5:22. I don't have any guitars with me atm so I'm not sure what the exact key is to start, but the riff before it is a simple one, using the notes of the root and the flat fifth of that key. When the riff OP asks about comes in, the root is shifted down three semitones. Note however, that this riff doesn't start on the root note of the new key. It starts on the major third, or the fourth degree of the Symmetrical scale (Byzantine scale as drop likes to call it.) The preceding riff also doesn't *end* on the root of that riff, it ends on the flat five. So listening to the two riffs independently, you wouldn't typically draw a comparison between the two at all because there are few scale steps connecting the two... but if you were to hum the root of the preceding riff and sustain it over the beginning of the next one, you would hear that it rings out three semitones over the root of the riff in question. 

Another thing that happens which makes your riff worth continuing, is that the rest of the song develops as this hook is played. When in its original context, it sounds eerie and disjointed, but eventually, the drum beat is doubled over, giving it more of a marching feeling. Most good artists in any genre are capable of recognizing when good times to do this are.

I think it is funny you should find this one so interesting though, but I guess it just goes to show how different people's criterion for music are. Technically speaking, it wasn't anything that hadn't been done before, it isn't hard to play or remember, nor is it an intriguing complexity. It also doesn't capitalise on a particular groove or energy that extreme metal tends to shoot for. My favorite riffs in the song have always been the one at 4:43 for it's neck breaking metalness, the one at 7:47 where the song slows down temporarily into some pseudo chromatic nonsense, and 8:56, which is one of the first strong uses of atmosphere in the genre, until it aptly flies face first into blasting madness.

I guess that is what's made Darkthrone such an appealing band for so long though. Their influences are widespread, and their disjointed, uncomfortable riffs, and bipolar switches from *facebangability* to *slow-march* passages have become a staple of their style and helped create a recognizable Darkthrone sound over their entire eclectic career. To answer your question simply OP, this guitar riff is compelling because *it's motherfucking Darkthrone.*"
"What makes this guitar part so compelling?","""This guitar riff is compelling because it's motherfucking Darkthrone.""

Question answered. (I love Darkthrone).

Thank you for commenting on other parts of the song, I will listen with new ears to those. Don't know why I zoned in on 5:22, but then I'm not knowledgeable I just liked it, maybe because it sounds exotic.

"
"What makes this guitar part so compelling?","Byzantine scale. So the way the power chords are arranged, it sounds exotic but still harmonious (or symmetrical?). I think I'd be able to recognize the sound in other metal songs. Thanks for explaining this so thoroughly!"
"What makes this guitar part so compelling?","For what it's worth, I've never heard it called the ""diminished octatonic scale"" before. Usually you just call it the diminished scale (which is a type of octatonic scale). The Byzantine scale is a different scale altogether."
"What makes this guitar part so compelling?","Does that have anything to do with a Locrian scale?"
"What makes this guitar part so compelling?","The first couple of intervals are the same but no, not really. The locrian scale is one of the seven [modes](http://musictheoryblog.blogspot.com/2007/01/modes-of-major-scale.html)."
"What makes this guitar part so compelling?","The rhythm section.

If the rhythm is left to play even 8ths pounding out one pitch per measure all the pressure is on the lead to be interesting. 

A good backup back band can make good simple lines sound masterful when arranged properly. "

"Here's a song my band just released called ""The Empowerment"". Just looking for some feedback.","Liking the mathcore feel going on, don't see too much of it around here. As for feedback, the riffs and song construction are pretty good other than the part that start at 0:40, I feel like riffs of this style have been done to death and are better avoided, especially when you can clearly write much better parts, as evidenced by the rest of the song. Overall though its pretty sweet. I especially like the wierd rhythm part at 1:36. Good mix and good song."
"Help with Unclean Vocals?","So, I kinda-sorta know how to growl/scream, but it still hurts a bit. I'm working through Melissa Cross's ""Zen of Screaming,"" and it's helping a lot, but I'm having trouble getting that feeling that she talks about, that buzz high in the skull that's supposed to take pressure of the throat. Any tips or help?"
"Help with Unclean Vocals?","If you're following Melissa, your technique is going to be thoroughly covered, so I'll cover the actual physical things that can effect your scream. Rule #1, same as Zombieland- CARDIO! This is HUGE, it's obvious how it would help, crunches help a lot too, having solid core is essential.. this us a big thing for me, I have shit allergies so, Every morning, completely clear out you're nasal cavities. Hacking loogies, blowing our your nose, over n over. You will probably puke early on. I do this in the shower, it's gross. You gotta quit smoking cigs, they'll construct your lungs and add to you're congestion. Hitting the bong I find most acceptable if you smoke weed, weed is ok. I like to have a drink before a show, ONE!! It's all personal, so if you find other things that help, WRITE THAT SHIT DOWN! If I think of something else I'll add below..."
"Help with Unclean Vocals?","He makes some good points, but some poor, if not necessary ones.  Cardio can help, although depending on your sound, may not be necessary.  A strong core is always handy, it will help you better than cardio, and will allow you to create more powerful sounds.  i don't do a lot of cardio, but can still hold +10s screams, growls, etc. the most important part of false chord vocals is air control.  Think about screaming as if your body was a cutting torch.
Your abdomen is the tank. it's where the fuel comes from.  the stronger the tank, the higher the pressure, the bigger the flame.  the throat is the control knob. it can go as low as the lowest piq squeal (the brie brie thing) or glass shattering highs.  your mouth is the ""flash hider"" (i can't think of the name for the metal piece that the flame comes out of) it is used to give your ""flame"" the polish, the glow, and can be used in conjunction with your abdomen and throat to provide a plethora of different sounds, pitches, and tones.


If i ever get a chance to record some vocals, i'll try and explain what i'm doing.

EDIT:  Congestion, weed, etc. dont' affect my vocals whatsoever.  When i perform, i prefer to be a little inebreated, as I get stage fright and the most important thing about false chord singing is being relaxed.  You should be ""pushing"" or forcing the sound, it should feel as nature as talking.  You don't push when you talk normally, or even shout, it seems to almost come by itself.  Remember to keep that in mind as you are learning.  It should feel natural, never artificial."
"Help with Unclean Vocals?","Lol. Notice I attributed technique to his teacher and have for him a few pointers from a physical aspect that help me.  Now.... taking it as seriously as I do, and having worked as hard as I have, I don't suggest getting lazy and drunk and think that's going to help my stage presence or performance what so ever. The metaphor is dangerous. If you can't explain what you're doing, don't give tips. Each sound takes specific training and is different from the last. That being said, here's real tips.. GROWLING everything begins in your diaphragm, even better, your PC muscle if you're man enough. A real growler can go thru his whole day without letting his core loose... I grown from the pit of my stomach and use my tongue and mouth positioning to change from the roar to the guttural. Roar mouth open, tongue down, breathe fire motherfucker. If it hurts your throat, don't get used to it, do it right! Get your belly tight! Guttural, I'll manipulate my lips &amp; tongue, watch Phillybo from Whitechapel on YouTube. It's perfect. High screams and fry's you can go 2 different ways. Clear your nasal learn to fry and do it right OR scream from the derivative of 'talking like a little girl' which it makes no difference if you're congested or drunk. But you're going to hurt yourself that way, easy if you're on tour instead of playing 2x a week. Just like the drums I play, there's so many cheap shortcuts in metal it's a joke. If you take it seriously and wanna go somewhere, you'll learn to do it right."
"Help with Unclean Vocals?","PC muscle? really? i've never tried bringing it from that far down. definitely something i should try out.  being drunk doesn't make you lazy, it's just something I do when I perform in order to take the edge of my nerves.  it doesn't affect performance, if anything, it improves the ""show"" as I feel more into it and don't stand around as much."

I've heard the term used before, but what is fry? "

"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","What are you settings on the 808 and amp model?

Sounds like you could do with backing off the the gain a bit taming the bass and treble."
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","I turned down the gain on both the 808 and the 8505 and it didn't make much of a difference, unless I turned the gain on the 8505 to almost 0.
"
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","What are you settings on the 808 and amp model?"
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","My 808 settings are Drive, Tone, and Volume at max. My 8085 settings are:
Gain: Max
Low: Max
Mid: 3.5
Sweep: Max
High: 5
Power Amp: Max
Volume: 7
"
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","Try turning the drive on your 808 all the way down and just boost the volume. You want the 808 to be pushing the amp it's going into, in order to thicken out the amps sound, rather than adding gain from the 808 itself. When you see guitarists using a boost before the amp, it's not to add gain, but to push the signal into the amp harder, therefore making the amp sound fatter, not to further distort the signal. I personally have my EQ as bass: 11 o'clock, mid: 12 o'clock, treble: 2 o'clock and the gain around 2/3 o'clock, but then using my boost pedal to push it harder. It means you get a heavier thicker tone, but not by adding more gain, which will make your tone less defined. Maybe take down the bass down to around 2/3 o'clock if you still want that mid scooped tone."
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","This advice on the 808 (having gain at zero) and these EQ settings are exactly what I came to say. The only thing I'd add is that when mixing, use a Low-Pass Filter to get rid of some of that fizziness (I usually set mine anywhere from 9k up to 14k, depending on the sound). 


Experimenting with different Cab IRs can also help.  "
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","Great minds think alike. Yeah regarding EQing within a mix, I tend to cut my guitars at around 100/150Hz at the bottom, and anywhere between the range that you mentioned at the top. Of course this all depends on the guitar tone."
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","Personally I'd add some mids and dial back the gain. You normally use much less gain when recording and you'll need the mids to cut through in a mix.

You've currently got your boost and your gain all the way up, so there's quite a lot there. The last recording I did was with a TS-9 everything 12 o'clock and then the amp gain also on 12. Came out plenty heavy, but you might need to double the guitar tracks. "
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","Waaaaay too much gain."
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","Thanks a lot for the help guys. I made some changes based on all of your tips, so see if you think it's any better. https://soundcloud.com/haaris-sohail/thrash-metal-tone-test-v2

And these are my settings. http://postimg.org/gallery/3kaebw66/e27afb2d/

I also double-tracked this time, and added a Low Shelf Filter to one track, and a High SHelf Filter to another, since the hi-pass/low-pass thing wasn't working well in Garageband."
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","I wasn't able to listen on decent speakers, but it definitely sounded better from what I could hear. A lot clearer an more defined. Judging from the image of your settings, I think it would still be worth taking down the bass, especially if its going to be sitting amongst other instruments within a mix."
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","When you say 'bass', do you mean the 'low' setting on the 8505?"
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","Yeah man. Also, something else to mess around with: the tone knob on the 808 is set so at the left, the sound is a bit bassier, and at the right, it's more trebly. It might be worth fiddling around with that, in order to see what sounds best "
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","Cool. So are you suggesting that on one track, I should have the tone 1/4 to max, and 3/4 to max on the other?"
"Need help to make my thrash metal guitar tone better.","Have it at whatever sounds best. Don't just turn it up because you can. There is no right or wrong as to what the 2 different tracks have in comparison. I'd personally just keep the settings on the 808 the same for both tracks. Maybe just fiddle with the amp settings so they're slightly different on each track."
"Looking to see if any vocalists want to put vocals to my tracks.","I upload bits and pieces i've written to my Soundcloud account. It varies in genre, but a lot of it is Metal of sorts. I'm looking to see if any vocalists wanna have a look at recording their own vocals to it.

"Im 16 years old, and i just got picked up by a Tech Death band for my first 3 week tour! Got any must know tour tips?","* Sleep when you can, where you can. 
* Get a Nalgene water bottle or something similar. Water is free and important to your body. When you run out of money (Which you will) - a good reusable water bottle is nice to have.
* Depending on climate, pack accordingly. Don't just bring shorts and tanks for a tour that might go thru the mountains. Bring a hoodie and jeans.
* Roll on de-oderant or shower in a bottle. Life saver
* Baby wipes, seriously nice to have around
* Bring a pillow and a blanket
"
"Im 16 years old, and i just got picked up by a Tech Death band for my first 3 week tour! Got any must know tour tips?","* Bring something to do in the van, books are good.
* Bring ear plugs and use them.
* When you arrive at the venue, don't disappear. There's work that needs do be done, do your share. Also, if you go somewhere, tell someone where you're going and how long you expect to be back. Take your phone and answer it.
* Tours are a lot of waiting (in the van, at the venue, at the hotel or wherever you sleep), have something to occupy your time.
* Be willing to compromise with your band-mates.
* HAVE FUN."
"Im 16 years old, and i just got picked up by a Tech Death band for my first 3 week tour! Got any must know tour tips?","Basically what everyone else has said.

Been respectful to the other bands you are playing with. Sound check at 6? Be there for 5:30, new strings, tuned up and ready to go. And you know that new song you guys have been working on? Y'know, that one that kind of trails off after the bridge? Yeah, don't play that song at sound check. Play your most proficient and tight song.

Time wise, work out your set to give you roughly 5-10 minutes before and after to factor in your stage clear off. 

Most importantly, enjoy it.

The first tour I did was around your age, 17. I had a miserable time. Didn't know what to expect really, totally unprepared. Thankfully now I have quite a bit of experience.

So in terms of being prepared, you gave us very little information on your band but this is some overall generic advice from a guitarist point of view.

* Bulk buy a box of strings not sure where you live but I use Strings Direct in the UK. Or drum sticks if you're a drummer

* Same goes for guitar picks. Or drum heads.

* I'm not sure if you'll have a guitar tech or whatever but bring a small tool kit with. Nothing fancy, some small screwdrivers, pliers/wire cutters (for cutting the ends of your strings when you replace them.. or doing your nails. Whatever), duct tape (show saver for me once).

* Depending on your pedal set up, bring batteries. At least 2 for each pedal. Yes, even if you have a power brick or some other power device for them.

* Be nice to your sound guy. I would say buy him a beer but given the age that will be an issue. Seriously though. He is your last line of defence in regards to not sounding like shit. Don't turn your amp up unless he tells you to. By all means dial in your tone but leave the volume levels alone. Just because you can't hear it properly behind you on stage doesn't mean it doesn't sound good out front. If you're struggling to hear yourself, your vocalist, whatever speak to him about turning up the wedges. 

Fuck, I could go on. I'll leave it for now. Hopefully you have enough now to get you going!
"
"Im 16 years old, and i just got picked up by a Tech Death band for my first 3 week tour! Got any must know tour tips?","1) Sleep whenever you can.
2) It's okay to shower with your clothes on (or with your dirty clothes on the shower floor) if you don't have time to do laundry.
3) Sleep whenever you can.

"
"Im 16 years old, and i just got picked up by a Tech Death band for my first 3 week tour! Got any must know tour tips?","Be confident, but don't take yourself too seriously. Be friendly to everyone, because networking can be very, very valuable. 

What band are you touring with?"
"Im 16 years old, and i just got picked up by a Tech Death band for my first 3 week tour! Got any must know tour tips?","Everyone has good tips, but some additional ones and I will highlight other important ones:

* It's not all fun and games; it's A LOT of work
* But still, have fun
* Sleep when you can or you will get sick
* Bring some MRE's, Ramen Noodles, or something of the sort. There may be days where you WILL be hungry and have no money or time to eat
* Water. For fucks sake. Bring a water bottle. A bobble or Brita bottle is good if you end up in areas with poor water conditions.
* Not sure the popularity of your band, but don't be surprised if you're up early doing signings, interviews, promotions, etc. Again, highlight sleep if this happens
* Shower when you can since it will be infrequent
* Pillow and a sleeping bag/blanket
* Books, Nook, or something. There may not be a lot of waiting around time. But it's boring as shit between cities
* Can't highlight this enough: Be nice to your sound guy if you're not doing it yourself. Their attitude can affect how awesome or shitty you sound.
* Bring extra everything! Extra guitars (or drum heads), sticks, picks, dicks, etc."

"[Discussion] I released several videos going over the concept of riffs and my approach to writing them","Some background for my Youtube channel:

There are a ton of resources out there for beginner musicians trying to learn how to play, but the majority of these channels I feel stick to the basics in order to reach the widest audience. It ends up being not very informative especially for guitar videos when it's some guy showing you how to play a song by calling out each fret+string. I imagine the same frustrating thing must exist for drummers and bass players as well.

There are less channels out there that are willing to talk about songwriting and musicianship from a conceptual standpoint and even fewer of those channels are dedicated to metal. I want to try and drive more discussion, which is why I'm releasing a series of videos where I present my personal approach to writing music with an ultimate goal of expanding these discussions by getting more people to do the same. Or at least we can talk about it here.

At lot of my earlier videos are fluff and not very organized, but my 3 most recent are concerned with riffs, both as a conceptual thing as well as a look into my own thought process when it comes to writing riffs.

[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQIDzxiRvPI)

I try to describe the process when taking a chord progression and turning it into an actual riff. I've highlighted the rhythmic and harmonic aspects of a riff although I feel like I might be missing something else. 

I follow that with a couple of methods I use to write riffs. Now these are more specific to black metal, which is my background, but the concept should still apply to other areas.

The first method is playing a simple melody over different parts of a chord progression (Nightmare). The next is creating pattern and consistently applying that pattern over the course of the riff (Shadow). Finally, I end with possibly the simplest method for writing a riff, that is holding a pedal point across your chord progression over a strumming pattern (Autre Temps), a technique you'll find a lot in Alcest, who ends up being used in a ton of my videos because of this.

[Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rpOryJ4wYI)

The idea here is much more abstract, and this video is less of a discussion and more a ""Behind the Scenes"" for anyone who might actually be a fan of my music. There's also some background info on my channel to clarify points for anyone going through a video-by-video progression.

The main point is to identify the habits that you use across your music and rather than allowing it to take over and ""Nickelbacking"" the same songs over and over again, use it to create an indentity. I talk about my influences and plug a couple of my favorite bands if you guys are loooking for black metal recommendations. Nothing really important to see here.

[Video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1NS6p984cg&amp;feature=youtu.be)

This final video is a quick example of a concept that I use throughout my music, which is to take a riff and develop it into secondary riffs, as opposed to writing independent riffs and putting them together into a song.

The idea here is that you extract as many details as you can from within a riff for more efficient songwriting that's also more cohesive rather than sticking different ideas together and making them work. In addition to holding a part together, it can create bigger transitions when you move to a section that is written from an independent riff. The example is again from my original, Shadow which I partially broke down in the first video.

So whatever you think, give me your ideas. What I want to see is more people opening up their thought process and presenting their songwriting perspective. If something doesn't make sense, I can try my best to clarify. If something's wrong, feel free to correct. If you have something to add, definitely let me know. We're here to talk music."

A couple of things to note: I just moved into an apartment so I can't have my amp loud or project my voice the way I'm used to, which sucks cause it makes things harder to hear (but then again, black metal). If I could gain access to a studio, I would redo the vocals."

"My Black Metal cover of Raining Blood","Little secret, I write all of my music in guitar pro so for the sake of convenience (laziness), that's what I use for my drums. I suppose one day I'll go to something better (or a real drum kit) when I can afford it. I am slowly learning advancecd compression techniques to give it a so called punchier sound but nothing really rivals the ""In Your Faceness"" of the Reign In Blood. If only Rick Rubin kept the same technique he used on that album rather than being the lazy metal ruining fuck he is nowadays."
"My Black Metal cover of Raining Blood","Vocals could use some work, it sounds very whispery and like a kid who lost his voice, to fix this you just need much more power and volume in the vocals. Everything else is awesome."

"My black-doom project Batsheva released its debut record today! I recorded it in my living room with an acoustic guitar and borrowed bass, and it somehow managed to sound alright considering.

"My black-doom project Batsheva released its debut record today! I recorded it in my living room with an acoustic guitar and borrowed bass, and it somehow managed to sound alright considering. I'd love your feedback!","Yeah, I'm not entirely happy with how the bass turned out, as it feels a little too buried in the mix most of the time. I plugged the bass guitar right into my audio interface and used digital amps, but did likewise for the guitar, so the problem was probably just me being generally inexperienced at mixing this kind of music."

"My black-doom project Batsheva released its debut record today! I recorded it in my living room with an acoustic guitar and borrowed bass, and it somehow managed to sound alright considering. I'd love your feedback!","Thank you, I really appreciate that!

The chorus sound is two Reason synths -- one ""female"" choir, one ""male"" -- that are both sent to the same reverb. I usually layer a couple more synths behind that, which can be any number of things, usually a simulation of a violin section or organ.

Yeah, for the longest time I didn't even think about trying it because I just didn't own a proper electric guitar and was way too broke to buy one. Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" tried it out, and to my surprise it sounded alright. :)"

Did some freelance work and logged all my monthly expenses, then cut everything down to what I absolutely needed and bought cheap groceries for the last four or five months.

"Just got a Kemper. Did a Mark Lewis/Audiohammer-style mix test. I came a little.","Axe FX II or Ultra/original? The modeling in the II is definitely much improved from the first version. There are some great VSTs out there, but I find that impulses really fail in the dynamic components of the cab- the physical speaker movement and the thumpy low-end in particular. They sound like what they are, which is static audio files applied to a dynamic tone. I sort of doubt most casual listeners would notice, but that degree of realism, plus the CPU usage, are the reasons I upgraded."

I don't like the cab modeling much, but it's really focused on crazily accurate emulations of the amps, and the developer is planning 200+ amps over the next 3 years.

"Writing crappy songs","This quote from Ira Glass always comes to mind when people bring this up:

“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”"
"Writing crappy songs","don't be afraid to start fresh.  if you feel like the song doesn't have direction it's probably good to just trash it.  however, if you think it has potential then maybe keep hacking at it, take whatever you like and change anything you don't like.  it's not done when you have nothing left to add, it's done when you have nothing left to take out.

"Writing crappy songs","Sometimes.  We're all our own worst critic, and it's tough to block it out.  When I find myself becoming overly critical of what I'm writing, I'll take a break.  Anywhere from five to fifteen minutes, just long enough to get it out of my head.  I'll also listen to something that I know inspires me, either for it's musicality or the production, and try to really pinpoint what it is that keeps me repeating that certain part or song in my head.  Usually a clear mind or fresh ears can help.  But if I feel like I'm 'stuck' on a part, or want to expand on a riff, I like to take one fundamental aspect of that riff or whatever and slightly change it.  Time signature, tempo, rhythms, harmonies can all be altered somehow. Taking out a couple notes here and there to get a syncopated/off-time feel, or slowing the tempo down and add a few extra rhythms/chugs/etc.  "
"Writing crappy songs","There's a quote by Doc Hammer that I love that deals with this.

“To be able to get good at something, just devour this idea, to be able to get good at something, you have to actually have the drive to get better at something. So that implies that you know that you suck.
So to get better at something, you already have to be charred with self loathing. It’s the nature of the beast. […] Okay so now what you’ve got to do, you’ve already go self loathing down, so this is what you do. You create something. Create something and you despise it, now if you look at it and go “it’s wrong” you’re halfway there. If you look at it and go “It’s wrong, BECAUSE,” you’re there. Okay?
So then you do it again. And if you look at that one and go “It’s wrong, but I don’t know WHY it’s wrong, but I still know it’s wrong,” again, you’re half way there. So you create another painting to solve that problem.
That’s all it is.
It’s hating everything you’ve ever done.” "

"Black Metal guitarists, I'm stuck in a rut with my playing! Hjalp!","While I am being tongue and cheek. My point is that one should be relaxed and practice basics such as scales to a metronome. Maybe practice a different scale or a regular scale in a different key. 

Getting over writers block for me usually means improving my skill as a guitarist in some fashion however minor. Usually it helps not to over think what you're doing and just enjoy what you're doing. 

Smoking weed, or having a drink or being sober is there just help you be in a comfortable mood to enjoy playing or relax you before you work on something.

The chorus comes back in which is just minor pentatonic (blues scale if you want to include the bend up from a four to a flat five). Then it fades out to the same riff from earlier. I would recommend listening to the whole song though because it's a killer song. Also learn it because it's fun to play."

"Let's Talk Bass, Week V: Effects! (plus a bonus about harmony)","So, oops, I totally forgot to make the post at the usual time 'cause my mid-day was way busier than Thursdays normally are. Sorry.

To make up for this*, in addition to the promise of effects, I'm going to talk briefly about harmony, as that's an important part of counterpoint that I missed earlier.

**Harmony** is essentially the relationship between any two notes. The distance between the notes is called an *interval*. There are twelve intervals in the twelve-tone scale. I'm going to describe them in descending order of how frequently you hear them.**

- *Unison* is two pitches that are the same. Unison is the equals sign. This is *usually* between two instruments.

- A *perfect fifth* is from C up to G, E up to B, D up to A. This is one of the easiest intervals to use, as it's one of the perfectly consonant intervals. It's the basis of a power chord, along with...

- The *perfect fourth*. This is C up to F, E up to A, D up to G. Guitars are tuned so that between each string there is a perfect fourth (with one exception). This is the second of the perfectly consonant intervals. ""Perfect consonance"" simply means that there is zero suspense or dissonance in the harmony. This forms the other half of a power chord, stacking on top of the perfect fifth. Both of them together form...

- The *octave*, which despite its name is an interval of twelve notes. This is C to C, E to E, et cetera. This is even easier to use than the perfect fifth for harmony.

Now let's get into imperfectly consonant harmonies, which can add tension to a chord.

- A *major sixth* is one full step greater than a perfect fifth. This interval is often used for a ""big"" feeling in contrast to the fifth.

- A *minor sixth* is one half step greater than a perfect fifth. This is similar to the major sixth, but has a darker feeling to it.

- The *minor seventh* is one step above the major sixth and one below the octave. This is more frequently used in major-keyed works than you would think. It's often used to lead up to the root, which we'll get to later.

- The *major third* is often what defines a chord as major. The basic major triad is the root, a major third, and a perfect fifth. Occasionally one may add a minor seventh, as the number of notes between each of them is the same, resulting in an odd consonance with some suspense.

- A *minor third* is one half-step below a major third, and like its major brother can define a chord as minor. The basic minor triad is the root, minor third, and perfect fifth.

Now let's get to dissonant intervals:

- The *major seventh* is one half step below the octave. They clash because of how close they are. The same applies to...

- The *major and minor seconds*, which I am grouping together because you RARELY see them in a chord.

The last harmony, the ultimate in dissonance, is the Diabolus In Musica, the *tritone*. This is halfway between a perfect fourth and a perfect fifth. It is occasionally called an *augmented fourth* or a *diminished fifth*. This is really freaking dissonant. Great for effect, but use at your own risk. Dave Ellefson calls this the ""Metal half-step"", referring to it being a half-step up from a fourth.

The best I can say about these harmonies is play with them, learn how they sound and what they can mean to you, then start integrating them into your basslines. Fifths, fourths, minor sixths, and minor thirds are great as color tones.

Now that we've covered harmony briefly, let's get to the meat of this week: effects! I wasn't satisfied with how little I covered effects in Part II, so I'm going to remedy that now. We'll start with distortion and the three grades of breakup.

*Overdrive* is a light breakup of tone, intended to sound like a tube amplifier being pushed just a bit. It creates a slight compression in sound, as the peaks in the sound get clipped irregularly, creating a warmer tone. Some examples of different overdrive sounds:

[Subtle tube amp drive, with roundwounds on a Spector NS-2, played with a pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxxpzNyYMQU)

[Subtle tube amp drive, probably with flatwounds on a Rickenbacker 4001, played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGQtH-8zqRI)

[Medium-heavy drive, with roundwounds on a MM Bongo, played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaOsLfttcrQ)

Notice that many of these also have heavy attack. Overdrive and heavy attack go together well.

[Heavy drive, with roundwounds on a Sadowsky J-style, played with a pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4qwzLaFZkg) - Hear that buzz!

*Distortion* is heavier than this, with a lot of clipping, but there is still definition to the notes. In other words, you can hear the attack of the note as it gets played. Some examples of this distortion:

[Heavily modified Rickenbacker 4001, played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyaKtAyVVac)

[Rickenbacker 4001, blended with some clean signal and played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ieVlpixUEs)

*Fuzz* has zero definition. The audio signal of fuzz bass looks almost completely square.

[Primitive fuzz, probably on a Rickenbacker with flats, played with a pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXGSBgr8sbg&amp;feature=kp)

[Fuzz blended with some clean signal, bass unknown but probably either a Warwick or a Yamaha, played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJczQIliEdU)

[Fuzz mixed with a synth effect and clean for the attack, bass unknown, played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1cSLmKUYak) - Most of Muse's catalogue has fuzz on the bass, or at least a heavy distortion, always blended.

[Fuzz-wah up to :41, heavily modified Rickenbacker 4001, played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM0cdYVNXB8)

In addition to these, the most common effect on bass in metal is compression. This limits the peaks and generally makes the volume sound more even. This is great for fixing little deficiencies in playing consistency, making your notes roughly the same volume. Too much can kill your dynamics, though.

Now, let's get into a couple of the less orthodox effects.

*Phaser* gives a spacey sound. A fantastic combination I discovered is a phaser mixed with a heavy overdrive, as [in the intro to this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDqzFbAIWsY). There is also some fantastic overdrive and fuzz-wah later.

*Flanger* is similar, but has a more metallic quality than a phaser. You can hear a flanger on the bass breaks in [this instrumental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU7uGKV7d4E) (at 3:02 and 3:34), as well as subtle flanging on drums in some of the drum breaks.

*Wah-wah* is hard to describe, because the name says it all. It makes the bass go wah by rapidly sweeping a fixed boost of a narrow frequency band. It can also be left on a spot to enhance a frequency range. Cliff Burton was by far the most famous bassist to use the wah, but Geezer Butler and Chris Squire used it before him on songs like NIB and The Fish. Latter-day bassists using wah include Paolo Gregoletto, who uses it on pretty much every bass solo he takes, including ""Becoming the Dragon"", ""Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis"", and ""Incineration: The Broken World"".

There are wahs made for bass. They will get you a sound more like Paolo or Geezer, much less like Cliff. To sound like Cliff, you need a fuzz-wah, which is extremely hard to find. Cliff's was made by Morley, the Power Wah Boost, but it is not made anymore.

*Chorus* is the last pedal I'd like to discuss. It creates a subtle doubling sound, like two instruments are playing at the same time. [Here's a sample of chorus paired with heavy overdrive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmvhVPd_Tws).

That's all I can think of. Feel free to ask me about other effects.

*Actually, I was planning on including this anyway.

"Unique Merch Items","My buddy's band had keychain bottle openers with their logo embossed. Hands down the most useful piece of merch ever.

Opeth had pewter pick necklaces.

Dream Theater had bandannas which were kinda cool.

Dillinger Escape Plan had a tour-exclusive single (your choice of a 7"" or a cassette, lol) which was cool but a bit too gimmicky - although they may have had a digital download code, I'm not sure."
"Unique Merch Items","Here's an album I made of all the weird merch my doom band has done.  I'd also add that doing other typical merch items somewhat differently can be cool too.  For example, don't just do another black T shirt if you can get baseball shirts made somewhat cheaply.  Also, plenty of shirt designs are perfectly sized for back patches!

"Opening for Otep","I don't live anywhere near Cali, but I do remember having to go through similar ticket selling bullshit with my last band. Do you guys have a ticket quota that you have to meet to play? My band played with Emmure at one point and we had to sell like 20 or 30 tickets in order to play the show, it was rough. Goodluck."
"Opening for Otep","We've had to sell a quota  before but it was only 30 and the tickets were $10. This time they want us to sell 50 and they are $15"
"Opening for Otep","Sorry about the pay 2 play.  I think this shit needs to go away, but probably never will unless there's a huge upswing in metal popularity. "
"Opening for Otep","Yea it's a shitty way to do business but we want all the exposure e can get especially since the new owner owns another very popular venue know the area that a lot of big bands play at."
"Opening for Otep","I never liked trying to hustle tickets. It sucks when your buddies are like, yeah we dig your music, but we have already seen you play 4 times... "
"Opening for Otep","Fuck this pay to play stuff. This is a predatory move on the promoter's part as far as I'm concerned. They count on the small timer's being starstruck enough to agree to that crap. These people want your band to pay $750 to play a show? Are you going to see any of that money? It's just a way of them being able to not eat Otep's guarantee. If you're like 99% of bands out there you aren't made of money.  Work hard but also work smart. What do you hope to see as a return on this venture? Exposure?
You could rent a van and do a 4 or 5 day regional tour for around $750? Shit, for $500 you could get http://www.riotstickers.com tour package. 
This is why we play those tuesday night crap shows, so when the big tour package's come around the promoter's turn around and scratch your back too.
I've made that mistake before dude, and after the show you get 20 new likes on facebook or whatever, it has yet to be worth it.
Lemme know if you're ever in the Raleigh-Durham area and I'll get you on a show, make sure mother fuckers show up and make sure you get paid.  We'd expect the same when we come to your town, that's how this shit works.

tl;dr, fuck pay to play."
"Opening for Otep","Yea it's not the first time we've had to do this and it is shitty but the music scene in the surrounding area is basically dead and getting to play with a big band is worth selling some tickets I mean we have like weeks left to sell tickets and we've got 22 of the 50 reserved already with conformed payment. As shitty as it is we think the benefits outweigh the shittiness of the situation. "
"Opening for Otep","&gt; What do you hope to see as a return on this venture? Exposure? You could rent a van and do a 4 or 5 day regional tour for around $750?

That is assuming you can (a) get 4 or 5 shows like that, and (b) people will actually show up to them.

In my experience, neither of those is trivial. I wouldn't do it myself but there is definitely some potential value in being on these big shows."
"Opening for Otep","Dude, I can't agree with you more. I used to do the pay to play thing and it's total bullshit. I joined a band already playing a shit ton of shows back in the day and had to sell tickets for Otep twice. Being the new guy in the band I didn't have any fans to sell to and I just naturally don't have many friends. I had to make up that cost every. Single. Fucking. Time. I have a lot of great memories and played a lot of great shows doing that shit but it was rough. Working 40 hours a week, driving out to Hollywood(an hour away) and trying to sell tickets and work in practice and all that shit just adds up. I've seen promoters try to take band's equipment because they didn't sell all of their tickets. In another instance I remember where the band was short(I don't know by how much) but they kept the money and the band didn't even get to play - a bunch of friends of this band paid to see their friends not play. 

The band I used to be in still does the pay to play thing occasionally but largely does the model you're speaking about - you get me a show and some heads and I'll do the same for you. It's about the community and the local scene. Don't make these places money, they already have enough. Playing with your favorite bands is dope but how many times does that happen and you don't get to talk or chill with them afterwards anyways?"
"Opening for Otep","I personally can't stand Otep, but I just wanted to jump on here and say good luck and I hope you kill it!!

Just be glad Claude doesn't work there anymore, he was kinda a dick to us when our band played there."
"Opening for Otep","Yea we've played there once before and he was an asshole to us. Thanks for the support"
"Opening for Otep","Claude was a dick, but he was a pretty good sound guy. his skills began to falter as his health did, which is why he is gone. 

despite the overall shittiness of the boardwalk, the sound was usually the highlight. even the ace of spades, as nice as it is, usually sounds like shit when metal bands play there."
"Opening for Otep","Yeah, that's true. I haven't been since he left though, so I can't judge whoever does it now either. I feel you on Ace of Spades though, their only upside is the multiple bars.

BUT, just cause it's still bothering me and it really pissed me off... I saw Black Dahlia Murder there not that long ago, and I lost my wristband in the pit. I tried to get another one, but they told me I had to go find my old one first... SERIOUSLY?? I went to like 3 different employees / security guards and no one would help me out. It was bullshit, I kept trying to show my ID, that I wasn't trying to scam them or something, and they didn't even care. "

More details inside:","[Radio Reddit](http://radioreddit.com) is a free platform built by reddit musicians to promote reddit musicians and provide quality music to listeners.  

We've been making a lot of friends in the industry lately and have grown exponentially (close to 20,000 artists).  

On November 23rd, we will having our first Radio Reddit showcase at the Whisky A Go-Go in Los Angeles.  Headlining will be RR artists [Nekrogoblikon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsMKOx6fumc).  We have four open slots that we need to fill with L.A. area artists.  

If you are interested in performing, we will connect you with the Whisky to explain everything (yes it's a paying gig).  We are hoping to make this the first of many events at the Whisky, and have a few media partners that are interested in joining to get our message out there.... that independent musicians deserve to be heard.  

Personally, I'm a huge fan of all types of metal (the more extreme and unique the better!) so getting to this point is a huge victory for me as an independent artist, and a member of the Radio Reddit team.  

If you would like to be involved, please PM here with some examples of your music and information about your band.  You can also send it to sean@radioreddit.com (preffered) and I will get it to the right people.  

You can also tune in to our [metal stream](http://cdn.audiopump.co/radioreddit/metal_mp3_128k) to see what other Radio Reddit artists have to offer. "

I've played drums in a few bands over the years, so I have a bit of experience with song writing, though just drums for my part. Those two tracks I linked are the only ones on my soundcloud that I wrote everything. The rest are some stuff I'm working on with another redditor actually. He's going to re-track the guitars and add tons more to it. I'm only doing the drums on those.

"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","Hey, I can actually make a solid recommendation! This must be my lucky week for posting here.

I've got a pair of [AKG K240 mkII's](http://www.amazon.com/AKG-240-Stereo-Studio-Headphones/dp/B0016MNBAM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404779972&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=akg+k240) I love very much. I got them at a good deal on Amazon when I ordered the old version and they sent me the new version either by accident or through trying to phase out the old version. In short, they sound fantastic. They're pretty flat in terms of frequency response, but being over-ear they still have pretty deep-sounding bass. I've found them really nice for recording and mixing. 

The only downside I can think of is they can get pretty uncomfortable over long periods of time, but this is definitely a personal thing, as I have pretty weird-shaped ears that have bits of flesh sticking out everywhere. 

If you can't afford the the $110ish pricetag (I couldn't when I got them), it appears Amazon still sells the original version for around $70. They are (according to what I've read) almost exactly the same headphones in terms of drivers/construction, just with less padding and fewer accessories (the mkII's come with a second replaceable cable, a different set of ear pads, and an 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter). I have no doubt these would also be an excellent investment if they in fact are the same headphones as the ones I own. [Here](http://www.amazon.com/AKG-240-Semi-Open-Studio-Headphones/dp/B0001ARCFA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404784788&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=akg+k240) are the originals.

Hope this helps!
"
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","That is a great recommendation. I've been reading about other headphones and they're all closed-back. The older version of the headphones you linked are semi-open. Are the MK II's semi-open as well and is that a game changer?"
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","Yep, both models are semi-open.

I'm not really sure what ""semi-open"" means in comparison to ""closed"" and ""fully-open"" headphone designs, all the research I've done on the topic points to it being a marketing term with little meaning. Not sure if this is true. Essentially, from what I can tell, ""open design"" just means that there's some ventilation on the outside that allows air through the headphones, apparently giving the appearance that the sound is coming from an outside source. ""Closed"" are obviously closed-back and allow no air through. This apparently allows for more present bass etc., but you can get an ""inside-the-head"" effect making the sound appear too close to you. ""Semi-open"" is an attempt to compromise.  

You might already know all this, I'm mostly typing it for myself because some of this new to me. Is it a game-changer for the k-240's? Nah, I don't think so. I suppose you can't go wrong with something that's supposed to be the best of two worlds. Just be aware that the semi-open design will offer less noise cancellation and leak more sound than a closed one, so if you're worried about bothering the people around you with noise coming out of your headphones, or work in a loud environment, a closed design (or some in-ear monitors) might be a better choice for you. I personally work well away from others, so it's not a problem in my case."
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","I've got these headphones as well and LOVE them. Something to note, though, is that you'll get WAY better results out of them by 

1) Burning them in properly. Every night for a week or two put on pink noise at the upper limit for comfortable listening volume and let it go all night. Looking for about 100+ total hours or so, and 

2) Get a cmoy amp to feed them more power unless whatever you're feeding them with provides a very strong signal. They sound pathetic when hooked up to underpowered sources like a phone (or at least my phone) and sound killer when run off of my bass amp (though they were not so stellar before the burn-in)

As for the semi-open status, they sound super open and flat; they reproduce whatever you put into them without exaggerating anything or making it sound all boomy and squishy. Also, you can hear everything around you quite clearly, so they are not at all good for isolation.

Also, the headphone amp is really awesome if you listen to music in the car through the auxiliary channel. You get way more clarity and power at the same volume levels and it seems to hold stable at much higher volume levels. I'm not sure about the other op-amps, but I've got an 18v one with a JRC4556 and super highly recommend it.
"
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","Thanks for this. I actually ordered these ones last night and just got a text saying that they'll be delivered today. I'm looking forward to trying them when I get home. 

1) Thank you in particular for bringing up burn-in. I haven't come across anyone recommending that process on any of the forums I've been on. I'll make sure to do that. I'll probably just find an .mp3 of ""pink noise"" and let it sit.
2) Is a cmoy amp the same thing as a regular headphone amp? Because most of the time I'm going to be running these through a Samson C-que8"
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","There seems to be some debate as to how much or even if burn-in is a thing, but anecdotally, I definitely noticed a substantial difference in how strongly bass and cleanly was reproduced and overall volume handling at any frequency. I'd say it's totally worth it. For my burn in I just downloaded one of those sleep sounds apps that had a pink noise module and played it through my phone while I slept.

And yep, cmoy amp has become a generic name for a diy headphone amp. I recommended one specifically as opposed to saying a headphone amp as you can usually buy well built ones on ebay or etsy for like $50 bucks, which I understand is way cheaper than most headphone amps. Also, they are super portable and can be used for any time you need better results out of low output devices or not particularly efficient headphones or desktop speakers.

Also, you can often customize the build of the device, depending on the builder. I've seen ones that have multiple outs, can be plugged in or battery powered, and even with various eq controls.

And on top of all that, people are always interested in why your headphones are plugged into a penguin mints tin and always blown away when they plug their own headphones into it and hear the difference :) Makes an instant lil jon out of most folks: ""Hhhhwhat?!"""
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","I've got a pair of those that I've used almost every day for about 5 and a half years for general music listening. What they lack in bass is sheer clarity. Phenomenal headphones and I recommend them to anyone."
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","Sennheiser HD 280 Pro. You can get them cheap and they sound great. "
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","I use Beyerdynamic DT-770 pro's.  Excellent headphones, deep bottom end, I use them to mix bass because my monitors won't show a lot of bass.  A little more than the other suggestions, but less than the price of a single good monitor.  Can't go wrong with those."
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","Hm. I just looked these up on Amazon and it shows 250, 32 and 80 Ohm versions of this model. I'm new to this and not sure what the difference would be especially for the cost involved. I'd be plugging these in to a [Samson C-que8 headphone amp](http://www.amazon.com/Samson-C-que8-4-Channel-Headphone-Amplifier/dp/B0002I9S12/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404784670&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=samson+c+que) most of the time. "
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","I use the 80 ohm, and I think the difference is that the 250's need to be used with a headphone amp and the 80s don't.  With proper amping the 250 and 80 should be the same (the 250s are built for amping, and they may sound better than the 80 amp'd).  However, if you plug your 250s directly into your laptop they may sound lifeless and flat.  I use the 80s and they work well in everything."
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","You can't go wrong with a pair of these:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B003LPTAYI?cache=d733496d13fd2dc564ded12a3116bf27&amp;pi=SY200_QL40&amp;qid=1404779906&amp;sr=8-2#ref=mp_s_a_1_2

Honestly anything made by  Sennheiser is a good choice. Just make sure to check the specs, 60hz is all you really need for low end, everything below that just messes up the mix anyways. You can also find cheap speakers and a mini sub for cheap (40$ or so). It's always a good idea to have multiple speakers so you can hear it on multiple different platforms. "
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","I've read nothing but good things about Sennheiser. I'm just a little skeptical over spending $22 for some headphones even though this got stellar reviews. I'm not bitching about the price but I'm just afraid ""you get what you pay for,"" ya know? "
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","I completely understand, I bought mine 2 years ago and haven't had a single problem. I've beaten them to hell and without doubt they are the best pair I've ever owned. My step mother has beats headphones, and these are far superior without the stupid price. I actually had a pair of high end Bose headphones that I traded in and ended up buying these. 

I can only imagine that buying a more expensive pair would sound even better, but these are incredible themselves. "
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","My pair just arrived today, they are easily comparable to my friends £100 headphones. and hey they are cheap, worst case is you waste a pretty small amount of money (even though you can just sell them again on ebay and get ya money back)."
"Can't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?","Other users have pointed out fantastic headphones. But when you're specifically mixing and mastering, I prefer shitty $10 headphones. Why? Because if it sounds good on those then it sure as hell will sound good on a good pair of headphones.

That being said, I definitely recommend listening on both. "
"Anyone else using a line 6 spider III?","Thought i'd post this here since line6 seems to get a ton of shit on /r/guitar. Just bought a spider III off of a friend. Been noodling with some of the preset amps but I was wondering what tones you guys might be getting out of it. I'm looking for something in the vein of of Behemoth, vesania, Dimmu Borgir, Cradle of Filth (I did find the CoF preset.), etc. And more traditional black metal a la gorgoroth, Watain, Immortal.  Just looking for your thoughts and ideas."
"Anyone else using a line 6 spider III?","if you need a small bedroom practice amp with a lot of gains, this is it imo."
"Anyone else using a line 6 spider III?","&gt; gains

but yeah they aren't too bad for bedroom stuff"
"Anyone else using a line 6 spider III?","do u even distort, bro?"
"Anyone else using a line 6 spider III?","Don't skip right hand day. Sweeps n' scales bro."
"Anyone else using a line 6 spider III?","I've owned just about every generation of the Spider series except the first one. They make awesome practice amps.  I still have a spider II 1x10 combo in my bedroom just for noodling around, and my roommate has a spider 3 1x12 combo in the living room just to have something to throw ideas out. You can get some awesome sounding tones out of them with the right amount of tweaking. Just use your ear. Whatever sounds good to you, use it.  And yes, fuck the haters, hahaha. I use a 5150 III 50 watt head for our band, but always come back to the spider's for keeping my chops up between gig's and band practice.      "
"Anyone else using a line 6 spider III?","The best tones you could possibly use are the ones from the Slipknot presets.  You can modify them to sound like what you want if you need to.  If you're not getting tone out of it, press the dial button in and move the d-pad over 3 spaces.  Then move down until you see tone and turn it up to like 90.  It obvioully gives it more tone/thickness.  The amp works best without a lot of mids.  Killswitch engage works well too.  "
"Anyone else using a line 6 spider III?","I've got the Spider III HD150 head. I'm using a B-52 cabinet, the 480 watt one. The high end tone from the Line 6 and the deep, low end of the B52 make a beastly tone. Incredible mid range. I'm hoping to upgrade soon but this head has been a solid piece of gear."
"Anyone else using a line 6 spider III?","I run a spider iv, fuck the haters. Anyways I recommend blasting the treble and bass. Mess around with the mids. It's gets heavy, though not as heavy as some may want. 

And reverb for atmosphere for black metal. "

"Getting Better at Guitar Solos","I want to be a better lead guitarist. How can I up my guitar solo game?"
"Getting Better at Guitar Solos","Practice other people's solos that you like; break them down into melodic runs and phrases; practice those in different keys throughout the neck; learn scales and scale modes to weave together those phrases; practice variations on melodic patterns and phrases you know; repeat as needed."
"Getting Better at Guitar Solos","Learn solos you like, and figure out WHY you like them. Techniques, modes, etc that stand out to you. Break them down and piece them together in your own way."
"Getting Better at Guitar Solos","I agree - it's not enough to just practice someone else's solo - you need to look at it and try and work out why you like it. What are they doing that stands out? Maybe it's playing techniques, maybe it's melodic ideas, maybe it's rhythmic ideas, etc. Understand the building blocks, then build your own."
"Getting Better at Guitar Solos","Marty Friedman"
"Getting Better at Guitar Solos","Scales are a really good thing.  I sounds cheesy, but they are just as good as learning other peoples solos in upping your game.  It'll help you be more creative when you start writing your own too."
"Getting Better at Guitar Solos","I know this answer totally blows, but it really is just practice.

I've found that what works for me, is taking a lick from a solo, or a whole solo, and just chilling on the couch while watching TV or something and just playing it at the slowest speed possible for me that feels totally comfortable. 

I did that for a little while and then suddenly I could play those parts much faster when I tried. 

"
"Getting Better at Guitar Solos","Play to jam tracks. It's a good way to work on improv and find out what licks work for different phrases and chords. It also allows you to work on finding the notes in key on the entire neck. Probably the most important thing, though, is unlike trying to getting a jam session together with other people, you get to practice by yourself. That means no one is going to judge you if you sound like shit wanking around on guitar."
"Getting Better at Guitar Solos","In my opinion, just fiddle around on the guitar, listen to music and if a part of a song or solo catches your ear then learn it.  Once you've learned it you can apply it to other positions and alter it to sound more original plus pair it with other phrases you've learned"
"Getting Better at Guitar Solos","Playing or writing? Either way; practice."
"Getting Better at Guitar Solos","I think this person is wondering what specifically should they be practicing. Just saying ""practice"" isn't going to help someone who doesn't have musically inclined people surrounding them to go to. Maybe they feel overwhelmed by the amount of information online and are just looking for a starting point. Maybe they are proficient at some parts of soloing but feel as if they're stagnating. Try helping them out a little more than just saying ""Practice."""

"Need help replicating this clean tone.","Well it just sounds like it's coming from an old music box. Kind of tinny sounding? "

Ive also got some help from some friends that have been in and out of bands with me since I don't do vocals. Theres definitely more to come and Im excited to see what you guys think of it all.

The guitars are sloppy, the vocals have little to no effort put into them, and what the hell is going on with that ridiculously loud hi-hat? I'm really trying to critique and not insult, and that's why I say again, with TONS of work, that could be made into a worth while song."
"Finally recorded a demo track with my band. This is only part of the song. Excuse the rough mix.","Thanks for your feedback.

We don't have a proper microphone to record, so I was uncomfortable with singing very loudly (the lead track clipped at some point as it is). That's next on our priorities, as well as a better place to record.

The guitarist had a few mess-ups, sure. It's a demo.

I have no idea what is up with that damned hi-hat. I didn't even notice it until people started pointing it out, and now I don't know how I missed it before. For what it's worth it's a drum machine, so I should be able to fix it in future demos.

There is also a lot more intended to be in this song, but later sections rely on having a real drummer, which we don't have right now."

What you address are valid concerns to be sure.  Obviously these guys don't think the song is finished by any means.  That doesn't mean that they need comments like yours.  You're not the one who came here looking for criticism, but seriously man, it would do well to remember the first part of ""constructive criticism.""  Maybe I'm no better than you when I say that the way you phrased that came off sounding far more like an insufferable cunt than it did actual advice, but this is an internet forum for advice.

"Finally recorded a demo track with my band. This is only part of the song.

"Looking at an amp. Seeking opinions","I am looking to buy a Blackstar HT-40 or HT-60. Anyone with experience with these amps recommend or not recommend and why? Thanks for your time."
"Looking at an amp. Seeking opinions","I guy I know uses a blackstar HT 50, I personally think it is amazing! all I know is I want a Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier Head! definitely check out the dual rectifiers if you have a large wallet :)"
"Looking at an amp. Seeking opinions","I have a Peavey 6505+. It can handle pretty much any kind of metal and you can get some epic tones out of it. I only paid £475 second hand for it, but it's like new."
"Looking at an amp. Seeking opinions","Both are sweet. Check out the Artisan series that come with V30 speakers. They will do any kind of music. The clean voicings can do a very good Fender or Vox type tone. The 60 watt combo has the presence and resonance controls. If you turn the ISF control all the way left, scoop the mids almost completely and turn up the resonance and presence it sounds like a Mesa. ISF to the right with the mids at noon, and presence and resonance to taste sounds like a modded Marshall. Super versatile amps that are built like tanks.   "
"Looking at an amp. Seeking opinions","I have the 2x12 HT-60 and I love it for its versatility. The OD channels sound great, except I have to use a decimator in the effects loop when switched to OD2 because of outrageous noise on that channel. Otherwise, nice crunch, almost brown sound. I've foregone external distortions in favor of the internal  because of its tightness. 

Clean channel is great, only a bit heavy on the bass. When I use a hollow body, I need to use an EQ pedal and roll the bass on channel 1 all the way down. Otherwise, it's usually at about 9:30. 

Direct out is among the most natural I've heard. Useful for recording, but overdrive is heavier than when heard through the cabinet. 

I'm impressed with how consistent it sounds at lower volumes. Strangely, I can practice more quietly with this than with my Roland Cube 60. "
"Looking at an amp. Seeking opinions","I've played on the HT-20 and I thought it was pretty stellar. Fairly dark sounding amp, but not overly dark. OD was pretty rich and thick sounding and the cleans were pretty sparkly, but not overly sparkly. Very balanced and versatile. "
"Looking at an amp. Seeking opinions","I'm not familiar with the individual models myself, but my friend got a stack of blackstars and we're convinced they're the best amps for metal in the universe."
"UK based Artists looking for online collaborators to create music for ongoing art project","been on the hunt for a while and now posting this to every music sub i can to get as many people involved as possible. already got 4 guys on board but need more people involved with a focus on specific talents. guitar, drums, bass, vocals. none will be turned away we need as many of you as possible!

just a quick breakdown of who we are and what the actual concept is. my partner an i are not musicians, we are performance and installation artists based in London, England. we are currently creating a multi-faceted piece of work that involves, sculpture, installation, merch, sound, and performance. what we are essentially trying to do is create a cult status around a central symbol. that is our horseman. the name of the project is Arrasa Con Todo, roughly translated means Destroy Everything. the music produced by yourselves will not be for sale at any point but will be used during shows to set ambience and tone. the reason we want a group of people working separately on one project is to see how each individual responds to a brief uniquely. we will provide basic info such as tempo and key, the rest is up to the individual. we will then arrange the individual stems into as many unique tracks as possible and once done roughly, we will submit back to the artists for review and criticism.

like we said we dont want this to take up a large amount of anyones time, just dirty lo-fi aggression.

this is part of a large project that has no financial support, we are working from the ground up and hence why we need to rely on like minded people who are enthusiastic about the project and dont mind giving up bit of time to add to something new. you will be credited for your work but it will not be specified what you did exactly, just that you were a collaborator.

we are looking for each track to be a journey from drone/stoner sound scape through to aggressive breakdown and chorus. really unpolished raw and distorted. its got to feel 'real'. The daw we are using is logic 9 pro so please try to provide the stems as raw files if possible avoiding compression, bouncing etc.

basically what we want is loads of different stems, guitar riffs, drum beats, bass lines, vocal stabs/lines as possible and to make them into something new.

PM me if your interested with a link to some of your work and your email address and i will send you over the images we have created and a brief.

"People who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?","Like many of you I don't have access to thousands of dollars in gear. I've been playing guitar for most of my life and writing for a while. I'm trying to get into recording. Picked up an interface and studio monitors to give myself a little home recording space.

Despite watching tutorials and reading what I could find I still have a hard time getting a good guitar sound with VSTs alone. I know it's possible to get a good sound, but I feel like the information needed to get started is hard to come by. I've accepted that maybe my guitar and interface maybe aren't that great, but for now it's all I have.

So, with that in mind- if you've had success with getting a good guitar tone from VSTs and impulses alone, would you mind taking a few minutes to write up a guide about what works for you? Something along the lines of what plugins do you use? What settings do you use? What's your chain? etc. I would be extremely thankful for that and I'm sure there are other people on this sub who would be interested in this as well, especially those of us who are starting out learning to record.

edit- I'm specifically referring to guitar tone, but I'm sure there are lots of people (including myself) who would love some guides for getting good sounds with bass, drums, ect with VSTs alone."
"People who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?","I wouldn't have a problem with that at all. I just need some time.

"People who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?","This sounds great, vocals could be stronger though.  I'm definitely following you on bandcamp now though, i can always use more of the riff."
"People who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?","I use VST's for everything in my music besides raw guitar signal (via Rocksmith cable). I must confess, I use some pirated software; however the free alternatives to most expensive VST's aren't bad. 

For Guitar:
I use Guitar Rig 5 most of the time, but I like to experiment with TH2 and Amplitube 3. Free alternatives are LePou's plugins; they're nearly as good. A typical signal chain is Guitar -&gt; Gtune (tuner plugin) -&gt; Guitar Rig 5 -&gt; any post effects for mixing like compression/eq plugins. 

My signal chain in Guitar Rig is usually pretty simple for a metal rhythm/lead sound. I start with noise reduction (my cable isn't perfect) and then go into a compressor to make harmonics and other quiet sounds a bit louder. Next I go through an EQ which I use to cut around 800hz and add a bit around 2khz, as well as cutting most frequencies below 80-100hz (those are exclusively for bass). Then I go through a tube screamer (max volume, 0 distortion, tone to taste) and then through the amp head. I use the Gratifier head (replica of the Dual Rectifier) and set it to about 3-4 gain (maybe more if you have passive pickups) 5 bass, 11 mid, 7-8 treble, and full presence. Then I go into an orange 4x12 style cab. For leads, I add delay and reverb to taste depending on the sound I'm going for. 

I've been using my 8 string tuned to drop E, so this sound is designed to be clear in the low end yet still heavy. For a standard or less lowered tuning you could probably get away with more distortion, but don't go overboard.  

For bass: I like to use Trillian bass module, but it's a massive CPU hog. As an alternative I use Shreddage Bass. I run it through Guitar Rig similarly to the guitar. I won't go into specifics, but it's EQ'ed around the guitar so they use different frequencies. 

For drums: I use Superior Drummer 2. I must admit, I usually go overboard on the drums and have kits with 30-40 pieces and 16 mic outs. But it's fun. 

For keyboards/other: I use Kontakt's default factory library for a lot of stuff. I also use Cubase's synth modules it comes with. 

Unfortunately I don't have a current example of my sounds in a mix, but I did make a song a while back using Shreddage 2 as a MIDI guitar using similar (but not quite as polished) effects as I stated above. I dislike how fake the MIDI guitar sounds, but ehh. http://youtu.be/uOtdGg6PLiw

Sorry for the wall of text :S I was bored. "
"People who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?","Hey thanks a bunch for this post. I'm going to setup something similar to what you've got going. The music you've made is incredible. You're a big talent : )

I hope you wouldn't mind if I picked your brain in the future if I come across any stumbling blocks?"
"People who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?","No problem, and thanks for the kind words! I'd be glad to help if you need any advice in the future."
"People who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?","There's very little magic involved. The VSTs these days are so good that it's hard to get it wrong. The settings are almost irrelevant, because like a real amp, it's subjective and people like different settings.

Get guitar. Select bridge pickup, ensure tone knob and volume knob are set to full.

Plug it into interface. You should be using a high-impedence input for best results. Ensure the interface is outputting a loud enough signal. You can check this on the interface or your software, depending on what is available to you. You should never be clipping but if you have lights on the meter you should be roughly in the yellow zone.

Pick an amp VSTi (one of the LePou ones maybe, or TSE, or the old Nick Crow ones if you like). Set the EQ levels all to mid/12'o'clock for now. Ensure you're on a Lead channel, turn gain down to something like 10% and master volume to something fairly low too. Play into it and adjust the gain to suit. Also adjust master volume, both to compensate as you turn up the gain and to ensure the output is loud enough. Again, use the meters to check the level.

Pick a cab sim/impulse loader, and load an impulse. Alter the volume to compensate for any loss (or gain) of loudness, and see how it sounds. Don't like it? Try another one. There are many good impulses available on the Andy Sneap forums. Or the Rewirez ones (http://www.redwirez.com/free1960g12m25s.jsp). If you don't know where to start, pick one that says SM57 because that is likely to be a sound that is familiar to you.

At that point, you're potentially done. You might want to drop a Tube Screamer VST in front of the amp vst (usually with the Drive value down at zero or near zero) to clean up the bottom end, and sometimes you want EQ or a filter to reduce fizzy top end as well.

The main thing is to make sure your gain staging is right (good amplitude levels at each stage of the chain) and not to make any dumb mistakes (eg. taking a stereo signal and only amplifying one of the two paths, putting the cab ahead of the amp, etc).

Beyond that, if you don't think the sound is 'good', you'll have to give more information and I'm sure someone can help."
"People who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?","Awesome explanation, best comment here imo.

I have a few questions though. How can a get a tighter sound? I'm using LePu amp, with a 808 OD, and throwing an impulse in for good measure, but my distortion is like, all over the place. The actual gain is set to 12'o clock, and if i lower it my guitar just sounds weak.

Any tips on tightening up my sound? How would i mess w/ EQ?"
"People who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?","'Tightening' is a very vague term. Certainly if the problem is too much distortion then no EQ is going to help. Probably the first thing to do is put a noise gate on there so that it's not making as much noise between notes, but to help further I'd have to know exactly what you think your problem is."
"People who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?","Do you mean tone as in synth sounds or tone for your guitar?"
"People who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?","Yes, guitar tone specifically. I probably should have mentioned that haha"
"People who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?","Here you go http://www.vst4free.com/index.php?dev=LePou

All the LePou plugins are great.  My favorites are LeCto and Le456.  Each one is modeled after different real world gear.  You'll probably want to filter off some of the high end, it can get really noisy if you have a lot of gain on your input signal."
"People who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?","There are some really good guitar amp VSTs, completely free.  I'll try to find you a download link."
