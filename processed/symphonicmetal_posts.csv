"Liv Moon - Amen! [5:09]","Man, I freaking love this song, it's like an evil circus theme! This whole album is probably one of my top symphonic metal albums of all time, way underrated compared to Golden Moon, and of course the band itself is way underrated compared to any well-known symphonic metal bands.

Does anyone have any info about when the next album is supposed to come out?"

"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","A lot of typical symphonic metal bands have a female lead singer that is either a soprano or mezzo-soprano. I was wondering: are there any symphonic metal bands that have a lead singer that has a baritone or tenor vocal range?"
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","Kamelot"
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","[Serenity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxt9iv1fyRI). that is all."
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","Thank you! This is exactly what I was looking for."
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","Kamelot's what I would consider straight-up power-symphonic metal. The singer's excellent (professionally opera trained, I believe) and his voice is around the tenor range. One of the best singers I've ever heard. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE6x2I1RoRk) a great example of the singer.

Rhapsody of Fire, mentioned elsewhere here, also has an excellent singer; they're that kind of fantasy-metal like Hammerfall and Dream Evil, although a lot more focused on the epic and symphonic aspect - you know, songs about dragons and mages and awesome shit like that. The singer's probably a high tenor, but not bad at all. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC5FMDjG6Mg) my favorite Rhapsody piece.

Diablo Swing Orchestra bounces back and forth between some serious opera female and a more modern male; they also blend in elements of swing and Spanish fanfare or something in their music. Totally unique sound, but [very nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhYiANz5oeI).

If you're not too strict on the symphonic aspect, try [Falconer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCG01wfgzpQ). I fell in love after hearing the guy's voice; it's a low tenor or something like that I think, and he's a great singer, too.

hope i helped c:"
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","Kamelot did recently change singers, but I'd say they still fit what OP is looking for."
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","I'm a little ashamed about this, but: had I not been informed that they switched from Roy to Tommy, I'd never have known that they'd changed. I mean, yes, now that I know they're two different people, I can pick out differences- Tommy's vibrato is different, his high notes are different, little things like that, but they're very similar indeed.

So, yes, still the same 'idea'. c:"
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","I love Falconer. His voice is definitely unique and soothing. He also sounds great live."
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","Maybe Therion would fit this criteria? Seventh Wonder is male-fronted, but I don't think that's what you're after."
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","Potentially Rhapsody (Rhapsody of Fire, Luca Turilli's Rhapsody, whatever they've called themselves now) would work, too"
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","Turisas - here's their [The March of the Varangian Guard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-5ZkTMyMc)."
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","Northern Kings 



They are a supergroup formed by several Symphonic metal male singers: 
 Jarkko Ahola from Teräsbetoni, ex-Dreamtale, Marco Hietala from Nightwish and Tarot, Tony Kakko from Sonata Arctica and Juha-Pekka Leppäluoto from Charon and Harmaja.


All of whom, are awesome in their own bands, but there covers are soemthing else"
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","Check our Damnation Angels! They have Pellek as their main singer. "
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","[Dark Moor] (http://youtu.be/SZGx_PEUJUw) used to have a female singer, but now they have male singer and they've become pretty symphonic. "
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","Heavenly - they are all male, but I haven't heard anything from them in ages :(."
"Symphonic metal band with a male singer?","Angra is pretty symphonic at times. I really enjoyed their Temple of Shadows album."

"Regarding leaked tracks...","Please check the rules in the sidebar - no leaked tracks, please. The reason for this is that I'm hoping for some bands to discover our sub - I mean, Blind Guardian just did an AMA in r/music - and I feel it would reflect badly on us to have leaked tracks at the top of the sub. It also means that fans might think the track has been officially released when it hasn't.

If you want to make a discussion thread then I feel that would be ok, but let's avoid links to leaked songs if possible."
"Regarding leaked tracks...","The band in question posted on their facebook page coming out against the leak...in all caps.

Why am I afraid they're going to get backlash for this?"
"Regarding leaked tracks...","To be honest, Nightwish get backlash for everything. They'd only have to post ""hello!"" and they'd get a thousand replies saying ""you suck, bring back Tarja!""

I feel pretty sorry for them, tbh. It's a chap situation that they're obviously upset about but now they've gone the wrong way in dealing with it and they're going to get a ton of abuse again. No wonder they don't like the internet!

There was a much more measured statement from Tuomas this morning on his official Facebook. I'm guessing it was Marco who posted the all-caps one, but I'm not certain."
"Regarding leaked tracks...","For the lazy:  

&gt;OUR INTENTION WAS NOT NECESSARILY TO ATTACK AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON, BUT TO RAISE AWARENESS THAT SPREADING UNRELEASED PROPERTY THROUGH INTERNET IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ANY ARTIST WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN. THIS IS ABOUT OUR MUSICAL PROPERTY AND THE ABUSE OF IT, WE ARE NOT ANONYMOUS, EITHER. THIS KIND OF THING CAUSES IRREPARABLE HARM TO COUNTLESS PEOPLE WORKING IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE. NOT ONLY FOR THE BAND.    

And I think they might get a little backlash like you said. As much as it sucks, things get leaked all of the time. It's the internet, once it's out there you can't stop it. They just need to embrace it and stop complaining. With that said, I still haven't given it a listen. I'll probably wait until the album is out. "
"Regarding leaked tracks...","I definitely agree that it would be better to avoid paying attention to it. Maybe even a small ""the single isn't out yet, anything you hear is unofficial"" message. I don't think they will ever embrace it. I'm an author and if someone ever stole an unfinished version of my work and spread it around I'd be devastated... It's such a tough thing for any type of artist."
"Regarding leaked tracks...","Kinda ridiculous to claim no artist wants it. There are plenty of modern artists in all media that embrace leaks. Some just want their product enjoyed. Hell, there have been gaming companies that patch pirated versions of the game. Nine Inch Nails once (they may still) had a torrent link for their whole discography. "
"Regarding leaked tracks...","they're getting backlash because they exposed a fan to cyberbullying by not blurring out the fan's name and sic'ing their army of screaming fangirls on them.

if they had just removed all the links they found and made a post about how much it upsets them, that's one thing. exposing the fan to be bullied is another."
"Regarding leaked tracks...","yeah I just lost some respect for them. They have every right to be upset, but blatantly exposing a girl's name like that and allowing everyone to cyberbully her is kinda sickening. They're making themselves look like money-hungry music artists. Reminds me of the Metallica/napster days. I mean seriously it's the fucking internet, you can't stop the leak. It has a name (streisand effect) for a reason... "
"Regarding leaked tracks...","Honestly, I don't think that was what the band intended. Nightwish are terrible when it comes to social media and the internet - from everything I've heard about them, they don't like getting involved with it and don't really understand it. (With the exception of Floor, but she only posts on her own account.) I think they just had an instinctive reaction and didn't have any idea of the repercussions! I'm sure they've learnt their lesson now that everyone's had a go at them about it."

"[NEW RELEASE] Kamijo - Throne","I agree, much better than Jupiter. Though the singer of Jupiter is much better and has more skills. And as you say Kamijo has a great dramatic and symphonic sound to his music. And its a better concept to watch en listen to. 

I wish that Kamijo made some remakes of his old song(From LAREINE) with his more experienced voice and a more symphinc sound. But that wont happen I think :P"

"Details on Blind Guardian's new album: Beyond the Red Mirror?","&gt;*Beyond the Red Mirror* showcases Blind Guardian’s long-awaited collaborative work with three different classical choirs: one from the Czech Republic (Prague), one from Hungary (Budapest), and one from the United States (Boston).  Two grand orchestras – each featuring 90 musicians – also lend their brilliant talents to the new recordings with absolutely spellbinding results.  

I can't fucking wait"
"Details on Blind Guardian's new album: Beyond the Red Mirror?","*At the Edge of Time* is my favourite Blind Guardian album. The songs *Sacred Worlds*  and *Wheel of Time* are particularly epic. Earlier albums by Blind Guardian contain lots of good stuff, but they're generally not symphonic enough for my taste. Three choirs and two orchestras? This next album is going to be magnificent! "

"Nightwish album ""Endless Forms Most Beautiful"" announced and cover art revealed!","I know I'm probably in the minority, but I don't really like this.

""Endless Forms Most Beautiful"" doesn't really make sense when taken at face value and just sounds really tacky; ""Journey of Grandeur"" would have been a far more superior title, imho. I really hope the music is at least good. If it is, I can probably look past all of this. "

"I got to meet Dianne from Xandria and Charlotte from Delain at last night's Sonata Arctica show!","Immortal guardians are pretty amazing. I saw them in edinburg, texas this year. Surprised they aren't more famous"
"I got to meet Dianne from Xandria and Charlotte from Delain at last night's Sonata Arctica show!","They're working on their first full-length album right now, which will be a sequel to their current EP. Hopefully that'll generate some buzz for them. "
"I got to meet Dianne from Xandria and Charlotte from Delain at last night's Sonata Arctica show!","Cool. Hope to see them after the show in Orlando"
"I got to meet Dianne from Xandria and Charlotte from Delain at last night's Sonata Arctica show!","Both openers were very cool and willing to hang out. On the other hand I thought it was a little disappointing that Sonata Arctica themselves now charged for meet and greets when only two tours ago they hung out after the show..."
"I got to meet Dianne from Xandria and Charlotte from Delain at last night's Sonata Arctica show!","It's a money thing. I'm sure you could still catch up with them after the show near the tour buses if you waited about an hour, but most bands do these VIP ticket meet and greets to offset the costs of the tour. It just wouldn't be feasible for them to meet everyone who shows up to their shows. In previous tours they had tiny crowds; on this one, they had more people show up because of Delain and Xandria."
"I got to meet Dianne from Xandria and Charlotte from Delain at last night's Sonata Arctica show!","This. I know people see it as a cash grab, but symphonic metal bands don't make much in the US. VIP tickets are a simple and cheap way for them to help cover venue costs. Besides, it isn't really that hard to catch the band after the show. A band's main source of income is merchandise and tour tickets. They don't make squat on music sales."
"I got to meet Dianne from Xandria and Charlotte from Delain at last night's Sonata Arctica show!","And that all makes sense, I just don't like the way they end up working most of the time. $50 on top of ticket price for a handshake, photo and autograph. Meanwhile, Iced Earth gave out special limited edition singles, tote bags, t-shirts, and hung out for like 20 minutes just talking. And this is the band with a reputation as jerks. even the stuff isn't necessary, I just feel like for most bands, they just want to get it over with."
"I got to meet Dianne from Xandria and Charlotte from Delain at last night's Sonata Arctica show!","That's true. Some bands can seem like they don't give two shits.

The Nighwish VIP experience seemed that way last tour, but they were going through so much turmoil, so I can forgive them. Assuming they aren't the same way next year. :-\"
"I got to meet Dianne from Xandria and Charlotte from Delain at last night's Sonata Arctica show!","I got to see three bands from across the Atlantic for 35$. They can't be making much money. "
"I got to meet Dianne from Xandria and Charlotte from Delain at last night's Sonata Arctica show!","It was kind of surprising to me how few people stayed after at the show I went to (Portland) to interact with them.  I only had to wait for a few people wanting pictures with Dianne for her and the guys to sign my shirt.  She came across as a truly genuine, nice person that was happy to be there, and the guys were a bit more reserved but cool.  I'm glad they were willing to put themselves out there and hope they had a positive experience with the fans."
"I got to meet Dianne from Xandria and Charlotte from Delain at last night's Sonata Arctica show!","I can't tell you how many people stayed behind after the show to meet the bands, because I'd be surprised if we even had 100 people in the venue to begin with. I feel like a good 30 people or so got a chance to talk to and get pictures taken with the bands, though."

"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","Welcome to any new visitors and subscribers of /r/symphonicmetal! 

If you are curious about what this musical genre sounds like you might want to check out this video I made about it recently: [The Elements of Symphonic Metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jATQJ3kqUx8).

The most successful symphonic metal band is [Nightwish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwish). Their song [Ghost Love Score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brcfttchzA) is in my opinion the greatest symphonic metal song of all time, and many fans of the genre would agree!

[Therion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therion_\(band\)) is widely regarded as the band which pioneered the genre, starting in the mid-90's. Here are two of their best songs: [Schwarzalbenheim and Blood of Kingu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZqxV_s0zRQ). Their awesome 1996 song [To Mega Therion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdTVNbDT_8M) remains a fan favourite.

There are many other amazing bands, albums and songs so stick around in /r/symphonicmetal for more!"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","I found this genre from the TIL thread. I thought I'd repost what I said there:

&gt;I have, at different times in the past, tried to get into both classical and metal. I never could, but now I see they were both missing something. Each other.

&gt;Thank you."
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","I think that TIL **is** the reason why this sub is trending. I found this place the same way."
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","Ah, thanks for the heads up about the TIL thread. I remember seeing it and mentioning to someone that it reminded me of SM, but I didn't think to look in the comments. That explains our increased activity!"

-Metal to Classical"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","One of those new subscribers here! Been a fan of the genre for close to 2 years now. Finally going to my first concert in April 2015.  I cannot wait to see Nightwish live! It has been on my bucket list for almost all of those 2 years!"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","Oh, I am mega jealous! I don't know if they have any European dates lines up yet. I'm dying to see them! I went to my first symphonic concert, which was Within Temptation, around a year ago and it was so amazing."
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","I think WT is next on my list. Love their sound! I've been to a couple rock concerts, (Kid Rock w/The Trews, and Kiss w/Shinedown) but this will be my first symphonic! Or even metal in general!"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","I've been a fan of WT for about 7 or 8 years now. I love them. They even coincidentally did a song with my name in it (Sinead, which means so much to me). I had been dreaming of going to one of their concerts for so long that the day before the gig I got scared that perhaps my expectations were too high. 

And then I went and i got front row and it blew every expectation right out of the water. It was phenomenal. They didn't play my song, but I got to meet Sharon afterwards, and after I introduced myself he said ""Oh, Sinead? You're the real one? You'd better stick to your guns then"". I pretty much died.

It was the best night of my life. Delain are amazing, too! If you're not into Delain, get into them. They are something special."
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","And you're the one who's jealous?
That is freakin' awesome! And I love that song! I got the vip package for Nightwish too, so I get to meet the band! And I do really like Delain! So pumped that they're opening for NW. Who opened for WT when you went?"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","What can i say, I want it all. Delain opened! They're opening for everyone at the moment! I was singing along to some Delain songs and Charlotte pointed at me and started singing at me. After the show she recognised me. It was a good night.


"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","Man, you have successfully doubled my hype for the show coming up! "
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","You should be so hyped! Floor is an amazing singer and she puts on a hell of a show from what I've seen. You will have the best time :)"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","And ""so hyped"" I am! Floor is an absolutely incredible singer! Also, Marko's beards...
It is unfortunate that Jukka isn't able to play with the band for health reasons. (Unless something changes by then) however, that doesn't diminish my excitement at all! "
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","Jukka isn't just on hoatus. He's had to leave the band because of his insomnia. Its really sad but be wont be back for wuite a while it seems. "
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","Yeah, last I heard he was still gonna help out behind the scenes where he could. Really is sad though. All the best for his recovery, whether he returns to the band or not."
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","Seconding the recommendation for Delain, because they are legitimately awesome as fuck.  Saw them at The Grove with Xandria and Sonata Arctica, after the show when they were there to meet with people at the merch stands.  Security started shooing everyone out, and Martijn went outside with the rest of the fans sticking around to make sure he got to meet/sign for/take pictures with everyone who wanted to."
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","Same thing happened here!"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","Ghost Love Score is definitely a symphonic metal staple, if not the best example of what the genre can bring to the table. The song still gives me the chills like no other :-)"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","That moment in the middle when it picks up after the slow bit... Got chills just thinking about it!"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","I should have subscribed to this subreddit way sooner(I just found out it existed)"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","So glad I found this. Have been in love with this genre for about a year (though I've listened to Nightwish for forever). I commpletely adore Kamelot, I have been listening to their entire discography on repeat for months and can't get enough of it. So many great bands here and I can't wait to find more.

I can't tell the difference between Symphonic, Power, Melodic metal though.

Anyway, don't know why I'm posting this, except that I don't know anyone who listens to this kind of music and needed to express it!"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","Whoa this is a subreddit? Hell yeah, I love melodic metal. "
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","A suggestion to our new friends: to find out more bands, subscribe to Napalm Records and Nuclear Blast on youtube. These are two of the biggest labels for symphonic music, and they have a lot of really great artists with them. 

My reccomendations would have to be: Epica, Within Temptation, Nightwish (who have an amazing new singer and who are releasing a new album in 2015), Sonata Artica, ReVamp, Northern Kings, Serenity, Delain and Apocalyptica.

Those are just a few of the many many bands in the genre. There are so many different styles even within the genre and it's such a kickass style of music to get yourself stuck into!"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","I can't help but feel like Amaranthe should be on this list, who have a new album coming out in about 2 weeks! Including this phenomenal single! http://youtu.be/T2e_3ZnJcTE"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","Amaranthe aren't symphonic, but hey, I enjoy them a lot. And they do often collaborate with symphonic metal bands when playing live."
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","You are right. My apologies. My excuse is going to be Elize's work with Kamelot, which is definitely symphonic!"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","What a lovely surprise!

It's been eons since my foray into the great chambers of symphonic metal, and to now see those two words together -- a phrase I had almost forgotten -- at the top of my reddit home page was really something special. I will be spending my evening happily perusing this subreddit, thanks everyone for having me."
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","Welcome! I'm so pleased to see all these new subscribers.  "
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","I have never heard symphonic metal before.  Why are all my shirts suddenly black?  Why did my hair grow so long?  When did my jackets all turn leather?  Somebody help I am new to all this"
"Our subreddit is a trending sub of the day!","Just discovered this trending as well.  I've listened to symphonic metal for many years, but that doesn't mean I've paid any attention to what many of the musicians actually look like.  I recognize half the people in the photo at the top of the page, but could someone tell me who all of them are?  

Excited to see this sub, hoping to find some new-to-me music!"

"What is Simone Simon's vocal range?","I've always read that she was a mezzo-soprano, but I've been seeing lately that she is a soprano. Is she actually a soprano now?"
"What is Simone Simon's vocal range?","[Here's](http://youtu.be/bCZoslZsr2U) an adequate depiction of Simone's vocal range. She's still a mezzo because her tessitura (where she sings more comfortably) is still falls in the C4-B5 area. She's been singing using more head voice in the latest singles, which might give the impression that she is singing higher (which she is, at least than the usual), but we'll have to see how well she can execute this higher range live.  "
"What is Simone Simon's vocal range?","Thank you. I really wish I would have taken music classes when I was younger. I wish I knew how to distinguish between different ranges and knew a little more about classical singing."
"What is Simone Simon's vocal range?","In [this interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Td1NK_fi6M&amp;feature=share&amp;t=26m55s) from April 8th, Simon says she thought she was a mezzo-soprano, but she thinks she *may* be up to a soprano now."

oookayyy..."
"Nightwish Showtime, Storytime trailer #3 - The Documentary","Anette is consistently referred to as ""the vocalist"", not by name. Did she object to her name being in the documentary too? 

It only means more time for Floor though :-)"
"Nightwish Showtime, Storytime trailer #3 - The Documentary","It's all a bit confusing. I think she said she didn't want any mention of her on the DVD. Originally she stated that she didn't know about it until after it was announced, which puzzled the director who said she was filmed and gave interviews for it, and it started a bit of an argument between fans and Anette. From everything I've read, I think the truth must be that she knew about the documentary but thought it would be cancelled when she left, but then it was announced that it would be released and that it would have show with Floor on it (which Tuomas explained as a last-minute decision because Nuclear Blast wanted a live show), and at that point she wrote to them saying she wanted to be edited out.

She also commented on her blog that it was the portrayal of Tarja on the last DVD that made her not want to be involved, but I'm confused by that as well. I don't remember anything on that making Tarja look particularly bad."
"Nightwish Showtime, Storytime trailer #3 - The Documentary","Wasn't it the book that came out after Tarja left that portrayed her poorly? Or at least said some nasty things about her husband, who proceeded to take legal action against the band over it?"
"Nightwish Showtime, Storytime trailer #3 - The Documentary","She said it was the End of an Era DVD. The book is actually very fair, at least I thought so. Here's the extract that summarises everything: http://hapfairy.tumblr.com/post/13404261367/once-upon-a-nightwish-extract
It shares the blame out evenly. I suppose Marcelo could claim that he never did the things it said he did, but quite a lot of them are pretty easy to prove, like that he stopped them going on the US tour and so on. The case was thrown out of court if I remember rightly."

It's already bad enough that she has to put up with assholes filming entire concerts or taking pictures constantly with their crappy phones, and having people getting overly physical when trying to get autographs and whatnot, now she's getting hate over that too? Pathetic.

And of course, as usual, the comment section on that site is just cancerous."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","Singer posts reasonable letter requesting respect for her personal space and respect when she is on stage. People react like she's a terrible person. 

It's ridiculous.

"
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","Why the hell are people attacking her over this? 

I wish bands started outright banning anything over a cellphone for shows. If you go to a concert just to film it you should be kicked out."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","Well I do like having one song or two recorded on my phone, just for memories. But yeah, being behind a phone the whole time, which my dad does and I cant get him to stop, is annoying to everyone."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","I mean, enjoy the concert, that's why you're there. A week later, watching a crappy video that you took instead of dancing... it doesn't compare. "
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","No it doesn't compare, but you can say the same thing about pictures of anything. Looking at pictures or videos can still invoke a bit of that feeling of being there. That is what memories are."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","Yeah, but what do you remember? ""I sat as still as possible so I wouldn't jostle the camera""? ""I got angry when that dude shoved my arm aside because they couldn't see the stage because of my phone"" ?

Obviously, recording a song or two or taking a couple pictures is different from recording the whole thing, but if you record the ""best"" couple of songs from your favourite band instead of losing yourself to the moment you do yourself a disservice, imo."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","I remember the great time I had at the concert and the feeling I got when Floor hits that last note in Ghost Love Score. Things like that. Just seeing a bit of a video of any part of the concert makes me remember all the good times."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","I record one song from every band I go and see live. I don't nitpick every little detail after watching it again and just let the memories return to me.

not everyone focuses on the minor shit and just having that fleeting connection to a past experience is enough to bring all those emotions rushing forward again."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","I really enjoy searching Youtube for people who have filmed concerts I have personally been too. Even the crappy quality of someones phone seems amazing when what you're seeing lines up with a performance you remember."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","I live in the Maritimes in Canada, where the closest city with 1 million people is around a 20 hour drive or a $750 flight away, so I have next to no chance of seeing any symphonic metal band, I appreciate that there are some good quality cell phone vids on YouTube."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","Didn't the same thing happen to Simone Simmons. Someone had a video of a bunch of people touching her hair and stuff, and then she says ""don't touch me/my hair"" and they went all berzerk and called her racist?

But I guess there will always be haters everywhere you go. You just have to ignore them and focus on your real fans."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","So that's what that video lurking at the bottom of all the YouTube suggestions is about..."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","I understand what Floor is saying, but I think the way she expressed her opinion wasn't perfect.
I completely agree with the phone complaint. It's annoying going to a concert and see everyone recording and taking pictures all the freaking time. I don't think she can change the attitude of the fans, though, and it would be responsibility of the venue and the security crew to prevent that to happen, more so when everyone uses flash, which directly affects the performance.

About the fans comment, though, I have mixed feelings. I mean, I understand her point of view and I also agree that she doesn't have to go around taking pictures with everyone (we pay to see a concert, not to meet them) and that's an extra we should appreciate, but if that involves paying, it becomes more difficult. If you've paid extra money to go to a ""meet and greet"" and take some pictures after/before the concert with the band, I wouldn't like it to be an ""Avril Lavigne"" situation where you have to stand awkwardly next to each other with half a meter of separation. If you don't like being hugged (which I totally respect) or that people touch your shoulder while taking a picture, then don't do these kind of things in certain countries. 
She goes to many different countries with completely different cultures, and in some of them the human interaction is closer and more ""intimate"". Saying something like: ""please, don't touch me"" when someone touches your arm before taking a picture, even if it's the politest way possible, it's considered a total disrespect to the other person.
I get that some people are psychos, assholes and very disrespectful human beings who just try to take advantage when she's near, but others aren't, and they feel bad when they get rejected while trying to get a picture of their idol.
I think that she should reconsider how she approaches the fans in certain countries, and I hope this doesn't affect her when she tours with Nightwish."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","I think it's more people going for full-on hugs, grabbing her and trying to touch her hair and so on. Certainly when I met her at a Nightwish meet and greet I asked for a photo and she just smiled, said yes and put her arm around me automatically. I don't think she has any objection to that."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","I'm glad to hear that! From her post I thought she didn't want anyone to touch her at all, which is what surprised me."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","was going to come here to say something similar, when i saw them in atlanta, we stepped out for a cig break after their show, saw them by the fence so we put out our cigs and walked up said good show, i shook the guitarist's hand. These nightmare stories always seem to come from south america. I wonder if there is a connection."
"Floor Jansen: ""I Am Not An Arrogant Bitch""| Floor's Open Letter to Fans","If you look at FB/Instagram/whatever posts, the comments are always filled with things like ""MY QUEEN YOU ARE MY GODDESS! come play &lt;location&gt;"" ...and it's almost always somewhere in latin america (or occasionally eastern europe).

I've always hoped someone would come along and explain if there was some sort of cultural thing I didn't know about that causes that."

"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","I'm doing my honours thesis on the details of how the orchestra integrates with the band in the symphonic metal genre and to do this I am going to analyse this for three bands. But to choose those bands I'm looking to symphonic metal fans' opinions since the genre is fan-driven. I'm wondering who you think the most representative bands of the genre are. Thanks!"
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Oohh, just three? Hard to say. The genre is diverse enough that I can't really think of what ""representative"" would mean for it. (One thing I love about it, let alone how diverse metal is overall) I'll try to give you some options with some explanation, and maybe you can use other responses and other sites to narrow down your choices.

So symphonic metal overall came from gothic metal roots, but elements of power, progressive, and death metal also played a part. [Therion's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvIW2dVv8GU) album Theli is considered one of the albums that pioneered the genre. [Nightwish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsV5sUuCn4M) and [Within Temptation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyuJI73Uxns) are probably the two biggest bands that you could consider as the first bands that truly began as symphonic metal, and popularized it, inspiring many new bands to join the genre. They have really great writing for their symphonic pats.

From a historical perspective, I'd go with those three, but to musically explore the genre you need to consider more options. 

[Xandria](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vLwWtSwNTI), with their latest album Neverworld's End, is very over-the-top symphonic metal, even though their earlier albums are more gothic. The orchestra part is extremely forceful and driving. [Leaves Eyes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ6He-9sLoY) is a fantastic example of the folk influence in the genre, although Nightwish has some of that. 

[Blind Guardian](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_ts8cPScXM), and [Wintersun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMbFu457jGs) are bands with male singers that I would say are better classified as symphonic metal than anything else, although Blind Guardian leans toward power and Wintersun toward death. Look at [Delain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkXhOhfh_f8) for an example of pop influence in the genre. Even more pop-y is [Amaranthe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHeMck0Ap3I) although they're not really symphonic. 

Do you want to consider bands that sing in other languages? [Eihwaz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXkdHRNnb6g) or [Elis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY_NINTZXkg) are bands to look at. For even more variety, consider [Diablo Swing Orchestra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osTu38yuuHo), they're avant-garde metal but could be considered symphonic.

[After Forever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdb7WsoRIo8) and [Epica](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTuwlD6cSUw) both have gothic roots, but are still best classified as symphonic metal. Both have strong influences of progressive, power, and death. One thing I like about these bands is they don't neglect the guitars as much as other symphonic metal, which sadly sometimes suffers from boring riffs to let the choir and orchestra have more room. I'd say Epica is one of the leading symphonic metal bands post-2010. 

There's so much more... I'd say since it sounds like you're a music major the best thing you can do is listen to all these examples, and much more. I don't really have music theory knowledge so I can't help you decide from that direction. If you're going for historical influence, look at the first three I mentioned. For being representative... this is tough... pick Epica since you can get everything from them (power linked above, [gothic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DwMJggG-vs), [progressive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nohoGUsr7R8), [death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKGxryyxeN8), great [ballads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eALDD5XaQuw), etc.). Then probably Nightwish so you can have some classic symphonic metal that started early and is still going, also for their [folk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2sd8UMUaIk) stuff, although Leave's Eyes has a much stronger Scandinavian folk influence. Third choice, I don't know, whatever includes the most variety after your first two."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Thanks so much for a really detailed reply, I'm sorry I've taken so long to respond but I wanted to listen to all the examples you linked - thanks so much for all of those. It's looking like my three bands are going to be Within Temptation, Nightwish and Epica just from the number of times they've been mentioned when I've asked this question in various forums and places. But I'll have to pick songs to analyse as well. I'd love to go into detail on a lot of the bands you and everyone else has mentioned but I'm not sure that's within the scope of my paper, but I appreciate having so many suggestions! Many thanks."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Nightwish and Within Temptation would be my picks. Early and latter works respectively. "
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Those two bands seem to be coming up the most, so I think I'll be using them for my analysis."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Nightwish because of Tuomas' song writing, Epica because it shows a heavier side, and Kamelot because it shows that Symphonic Metal is also a man's game!"
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","I have a friend I met through being a Nightwish fan who's really into Kamelot too. They're great to listen to."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","It seems like the most people are recommending Nightwish and Within Temptation. I agree with that, but I would like to suggest some albums to look at.

For Nightwish, you will be good with pretty much any album. Once, Dark Passion Play, and Imaginaerum use a full orchestra, whereas the previous albums are more keyboard driven. For Within Temptation, I would suggest the albums Mother Earth for more keyboard driven music, and The Silent Force and The Heart of Everything for the full orchestra. Their latest album is way more poppy and deviates so far from the symphonic standard that I don't consider it to really be in the genre."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","It's a bit tough too choose a Nightwish song to analyse for this project since I love so many of their songs, however I'm thinking of going with Ghost Love. I'm listening to those Within Temptation albums now and trying to decide which song to go with."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","I completely agree with /u/Tremaparagon 's suggestion in that diversity should be important. There's little point in analyzing three bands that sound similar imo. 

For example, you could talk about the different types of orchestrations there are. I mean each band has it's unique influences from different types of orchestral music. 

For example a band such as Rhapsody have tons of influence from Baroque era and classical era music. Listen to [The Dark Tower of Abyss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfRm2woctzo) or the interlude in [Warrior of Ice](http://youtu.be/ro-ACJ9vNEQ?t=4m14s). They also take music from some [medieval folk and classical music](http://youtu.be/mbyK65_bts4?t=4m6s)

On the more modern end of the spectrum, bands such as Nightwish take lots of influence from modern day orchestral film music. I don't know specifically but I've heard Tuomas has lots of influence from composers such as Hans Zimmer and I wouldn't be surprised of people such as John Williams or Danny Elfman were influences too. [Ghost Love Score](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN3yqMr3ffY) and [Imaginaerum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyxhuviI9Jk) are great examples 

There are then gothic metal/symphonic metal bands, bands that make use of folk melodies and instrumentation and much more. Like mentioned, the orchestrations Diablo Swing Orchestra are in the context of a swing big band. Early symphonic black metal bands use more ambient keyboards. The piano solo in [Art of Life](http://youtu.be/0eqmkgSeYjI?t=15m4s) by X Japan is totally modern classical and is even minimalistic. Symphony X I find has lots of influence from romantic and modern era classical music (listen to keyboardist Michael Pinnella's solo album) such as in their epic [The Odyssey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaN3pwBsRf8). Another example of the romantic stuff is symphonic black metal band [Sigh](http://youtu.be/NfRGvrfdpds?t=2m53s). Even Fleshgod Apocalypse is classical/romantic ESPECIALLY with their piano player that contributes a lot to their sound. Couldn't find an example but one of their new songs [Elegy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKzmT-VhrnA) shows off their style well. 

**tl;dr** do three bands that take different influence from different types of orchestral/classical music rather than three bands that sound the same. 

"
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Yes, great suggestions that are even more varied than the ones I posted. Also it is an interesting idea to look at these bands by type of orchestral influence rather than type of metal influence.  "
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Nightwish do have a bit of a film music sound in some aspects but as a soundtrack fan I think they use the orchestra in a unique way that's quite different to film music.

It looks like Within Temptation, Nightwish and Epica are going to be the bands I analyse and the justification for that is going to be the number of times they've been mentioned in answer to my question in various places about which bands are the most representative of the symphonic metal genre. I'd like to go for variety too however there are so many bands that it would be hard to explain why I chose a particular one - easier to draw patterns from the most popular bands."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","I would love to read some of your paper once it's complete if it's ok with you! 

I'm curious to know what Nightwish album(s) you're going to use because their music does have distinct 'eras'. "
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Well my supervisor recommended analysing just one song by each band in detail, so I'm going to use Ghost Love Score for Nightwish as it's got a lot of great material in there to study - orchestral sections, film-music-inspired sound, and of course Tarja."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Nightwish and Within Temptation are the 2 obvious choices, any of my other favourite bands would be too similar to those, so for the most diversity I'll suggest Stream of Passion as the 3rd, their style is quite a bit different, as are the orchestral parts they use, a lot of string quartet and more progressive style."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","I'll probably use Nightwish and Within Temptation, but thanks for your suggestion!"
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Therion, Epica, and Delain, are my three bands picks."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Thanks for the suggestions!"
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Kamelot with Roy Khan.  I consider Tommy Karevik to make them a more progessive than symphonic metal band.

"
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Kamelot is a pretty enjoyable band to listen to."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","I'm definitely saying Epica &amp; Nightwish. Within Temptation seems pretty popular but I don't listen to them enough to say something. (I should though)."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","It looks like those three bands are going to be the ones I analyse a song of each. They've been mentioned a fair few times."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","I'd like to see what you're going to write. Also need any recommendation for songs?"
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Yeah, if I remember I'll try to show you the finished result when I'm done. I think I'll do Ghost Love Score for Nightwish but for the other two bands I'm not sure yet. But my supervisor recommended using two similar-length songs (~10min)."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","If it's around 10min personally i'd recommend Design your Universe or Serenade of Self Destruction for Epica.
Id mostly go for serenade though since it may be more relevant."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Blind Guardian is probably the longest, oldest, and best known in the genre."
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","I would say Blind Guardian leaned a bit more towards Power Metal with some symphonic elements than actual Symphonic Metal. It was until the release of ""At the Edge of Time"" that the orchestra became extremely prevalent (Sacred Worlds and Wheel of Time), IMO. "
"What are the best representative symphonic metal bands?","Yes. they are clearly pioneers in the genre, and now full symphonic metal."

"Tuomas Holopainen - A lifetime of adventure (Official Video)","Lithium0992 is correct, the album isn't really intended to be symphonic metal. It's supposed to be a soundtrack to the Scrooge McDuck book, so it will be more like film music. I think there will be more orchestra on other tracks but also there will also be a heavy folk influence from what I've heard (like Last of the Wilds) and some tracks will have no vocals."

"Amazing new video from Within Temptation-And We Run Ft. Xzibit.","Kinda bummed about this album, to be honest, but I did like this song quite a bit."
"Amazing new video from Within Temptation-And We Run Ft. Xzibit.","I think that sometimes people are reluctant to change. WT have always been about trying new things, and they're influenced by a lot of stuff. They want to try everything at once, but they can't, so they try to do it by album. it's still very epic, though. I saw them live for the first time a couple of months ago and they brought me to tears. (Totally not just because I got to meet her and tell her my name is Sinead, and she responded ""Oh, the real one?"")

Sometimes it takes a while for albums to grow on you. I'd say listen to Silver Moonlight and Edge of the World again. Oh, and Paradise."
"Amazing new video from Within Temptation-And We Run Ft. Xzibit.","Oh, I'm fine with change as long as it's interesting. Their last album was great, I thought, but I find this one to be very one-note and dull. This song is a good example; despite being one of the best songs on the album, elevated quite a bit by the guest singer, it's still extremely repetitive."
"Amazing new video from Within Temptation-And We Run Ft. Xzibit.","I understand where you're coming from."
"Amazing new video from Within Temptation-And We Run Ft. Xzibit.","I'm the opposite. I thought their last album was awful. I really tried to like it but I just couldn't get into it. I liked Hydra, although some songs weren't that great. "

"Amazing new video from Within Temptation-And We Run Ft. Xzibit.","I hate rap. Always have, ever since I was a little kid. So when the album came out, I was ready to hate this song.

Yeah, didn't end up that way.  Ended up being my favorite song on the whole album.

"Amazing new video from Within Temptation-And We Run Ft. Xzibit.","It's a very symphonic video. Greenscreens, lots of moving about haha. Delain's video for Stardust had them in space. 

I haven't heard any complaints...people said it was a bit weird and they were surprised, but I know a lot of people enjoy the song. I love it. I thought it was really fantastic live, as well. You can tell they love to perform it :)"
"Amazing new video from Within Temptation-And We Run Ft. Xzibit.","Indeed I know it's Sharon's fave from the album so she sings it very passionately which is awesome! And yeah, I remember when the album came out I heard mostly negative comments about that song, ranging from it just not being people's favourite to people outright hating it because of the rapping. Perhaps it's grown on people..."
"Amazing new video from Within Temptation-And We Run Ft. Xzibit.","I think its a really inspiring song. It's big and meaningful and really fun."

"Best album of 2014?","I've seen a bunch of ""best metal album"" lists lately that don't include any symphonic metal, yet there have been some brilliant albums in the genre this year and I think they deserve some recognition.

So let's start a list here - what's your favourite album of 2014?

Edit - suggestions so far, roughly ordered by current popularity:

1. **The Quantum Enigma** - Epica

2. **The Human Contradiction** - Delain

3. **Sacrificium** - Xandria

4. **The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck** - Tuomas Holopainen

5. **Antagonise** - MaYaN

6. **Hydra** - Within Temptation

7. **Shogunate Macabre** - Whispered

8. **Mechina** - Xenon

9. **A New Dawn Ending** - Ancient Bards

10. **A War of Our Own** - Stream of Passion


Honourable mentions:

- Jigsaw Hustle single - Diablo Swing Orchestra
- Let Us Burn (live) - Within Temptation
- Left in the Dark (compilation) - Tarja
- Beauty and the Beat (live) - Tarja
- Argia - Diabulus in Musica
- Garden of Dystopia - Divine Disorder
- Origins - Eluveitie"
"Best album of 2014?","Obligatory *The Quantum Enigma.*"
"Best album of 2014?","Yup. TQE is number 1 followed by (MaYaN) Antagonise followed by (Delain) The Human Contradiction. Some excellent sound quality/mastering this year. "
"Best album of 2014?","I actually didn't like ""The Quantum Enigma"" and I am a huge Epica fan. I'm a lot more into the ""The Phantom Agony"" / ""Consign to Oblivion"" albums. "
"Best album of 2014?","'s cool bro. We all have different tastes."
"Best album of 2014?","It's weird. I like that band so much and I really want to like the new album, but I just don't. Still I don't regret buying it."
"Best album of 2014?","I have a similar issue... I like the album but don't love it the way I did with previous albums... The darkness and balance of growls/singing from the previous 5 albums seems to be missing, even though the performance quality and mastering is probably their best yet. I guess it's pretty fresh and as close to a ""happy"" album as symphonic metal can get... just such a big stylistic shift that I like it but don't really relate to it as much... 

Also, the other main reason I didn't like TQE as much as previous albums is all the formulaic songwriting (e.g. verse-chorus form) getting used on half the songs, and the choruses that are so... not-heavy. Still better than anything on the radio today though! "
"Best album of 2014?","The Quantum Enigma, and nothing else even comes close.

But here's my ranked list of relevant 2014 albums:

The Quantum Enigma (Epica) &gt; Antagonise (MaYaN) &gt; Serenades of the Netherworld (HDK) &gt; Hydra (Within Temptation) &gt; Sacrificium (Xandria) &gt; The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck (Tuomas Holopainen).

Honorable mention for Diablo Swing Orchestra's Jigsaw Hustle single, since it's their only release this year (I want their new album ASAP)."
"Best album of 2014?","Glad to see mention of Scrooge here. I find that record charming, compelling, and beautiful."
"Best album of 2014?","1\. **Epica** - *The Quantum Enigma*

There can be no doubt about this one. [*The Essence of Silence*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oePrtEMmX9Y) is among my favourite symphonic metal songs of all time. [*Utopa Unchained*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8y99z5EVtY) and [*Natural Corruption*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YjUFXebjp8) are other highlights of this superb album.

&amp;nbsp;

2\. **Delain** - *The Human Contradiction*

[*Your Body Is a Battleground*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKZgAVygp9A) and [*Tell Me, Mechanist*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrOaDZJ78ws) are two of my favourites on this one. Delain makes symphonic metal of the more mainstream, less complex variety. 

&amp;nbsp;

3\. **Alestorm** - *Sunset on the Golden Age*

The [titular track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFpwIEfxBP4) is my favourite song on this album. Don't listen to Alestorm if you're looking for traditional symphonic power metal (Nightwish, Epica, Kamelot). Alestorm writes in a variety of metal genres and only some of their songs are symphonic metal.

&amp;nbsp;

I have very high expectations of the following albums based on the previous work by these bands, but I haven't listened to them yet. Really looking forward to these:

&amp;nbsp;

?. **Pythia** - [*Shadows of a Broken Past*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ6e1ibOd40)

?. **Xandria** - [*Sacrificium*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGTAmmTiD_Y)

?. **MaYaN** - [*Antagonise*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OypT6Cj6qU)

&amp;nbsp;

And then there were these albums. They were okay, but I wouldn't put them in my favourites for the year:

&amp;nbsp;

?. **Within Temptation** - [*Hydra*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy6MpsDPKts)

?. **Within Temptation** - [*Let Us Burn: Elements and Hydra Live*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFvxWUFwECw)

?. **Tarja** - [*Left in the Dark*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFO5W4hSTDs)

?. **Tarja** - [*Beauty and the Beat*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XoJFEkWa6k)

&amp;nbsp;

*Hydra* had a couple of decent songs (*Paradise*, *Silver Moonlight*) but I can't help but feel that Within Temptation used to be so much better. The live double album has its moments, especially the *Elements* half.

Tarja's albums are only partially symphonic metal. Her singing is sublime and her band is extremely talented, but there's just not enough metal for me. It's the same problem Within Temptation has, only worse."
"Best album of 2014?","I wouldn't think that this sub would like it that much, but Sunset on the Golden Age is an incredible album. Alestorm is a really underrated band."
"Best album of 2014?","*We came here to drink your beer,
And steal your rum at the point of a gun,
Your alcohol to us will fall,
'Cause we came here to drink your beer!*"
"Best album of 2014?","I agree with everyone else that *The Quantum Enigma* is easily the best of 2014. However, I think *Argia* by Diabulus in Musica deserves an honorable mention. An excellent symphonic album by a not too popular band. "
"Best album of 2014?","/u/Archanoth says it all:

&gt; The Quantum Enigma, and nothing else even comes close.

Simone's voice has definitely gotten a lot more powerful, at least when compared to the last album."
"Best album of 2014?","Mine are 

* Mechina - Xenon 
* Ancient Bards - A New Dawn Ending
* Whispered - Shogunate Macabre "
"Best album of 2014?","1. Sacrificium (Xandria)
2. The Quantum Enigma (Epica)
3. The Human Contradiction (Delain)

I hadn't really followed Xandria up until now, but despite the fact that Epica is generallly my favorite band I find myself listening to Sacrificium more and more. TQE is a very close second for sure though. 

Honorable mention to *Massive Addictive* (Amaranthe). It might not really be symphonic but I can't leave it off a list of top albums in 2014."
"Best album of 2014?","I liked Hydra (Within Temptation) although it does seem to skew a lot from their past albums and I see why people didn't like it as much, I prefer the mainstream symphonic metal so it was good for me

I also thought The Human Contradiction (Delain) was good. I liked a few songs on the album including Stardust, Your Body Is A Battleground, Army of Dolls, and My Masquerade.

I really only have experience with those two bands and some Epica, but based on what i've seen here I should really check out The Quantum Enigma."
"Best album of 2014?","The Quantum Enigma gets my vote. Epica never fail to impress. It's been on repeat in my car since May! 

Honourable mentions: Hydra -WT, The Human Contradiction - Delain and Origins - Eluveitie (though that's not Symphonic metal!) "
"Best album of 2014?","For me is the debut album of Savn. Its nice to have some of the members of The sins of thy beloved back."
"Best album of 2014?","I completely forgot about this one, even though it is quite a good debut indeed! "
"Best album of 2014?","The Quantum Enigma (Epica) and Shogunate Macabre (Whispered) are definitely on my list.

However, one album that I wish I could let everyone listen to is ""Garden of Dystopia"" by Divine Disorder. They are melodic death with heavy orchestrated elements, with a few songs composed by Oliver Palotai (Kamelot's keyboardist and composer). I feel it can definitely be a contender for the 2014 symphonic metal album of the year. Though, I feel I am one of the few people - or even only person - in this subreddit who has been able to listen to the album since the release last month. 

I have asked the band if I could post one of their songs to YouTube and link you all to enjoy. Alas, my request was respectfully denied (likely due to some legal reasons, but it is unclear). The songs they had put up on YouTube have been re-recorded for their album."
"Best album of 2014?","Sadly, I have yet to listen to Epica's new album, but since it was so highly praised i will have to check it out. What surprises me is that no one has mentioned Stream of Passions's album A War of our Own. It was absolutely brilliant! Hydra was an okay album, but Within Temptation has become a little too poppy for my tastes recently, although there were a couple really good songs."
"Best album of 2014?","As much as I love *The Quantum Enigma*, I'd say it was only my second favourite album of the year. My top favourite has to be *The Life and Times of Scrooge*. I just think it's amazingly beautiful and something quite different to anything else I own, though it still has that Nightwish feel. Whilst TQE is a really high standard and just a brilliant record, I find TLATOS evocative and emotional. It's sort of achieved that other level of perfect music for me."
"Best album of 2014?","Personally I think this year was really weak in terms of new releases. *The Quantum Enigma* and the Holopainen's project were the only noteworthy ones, and I wouldn't call either of them truly brilliant. 

An honorary mention for a nice semi-symphonic work goes to *Erdentempel* by Equilibrium."

&gt;Dear Fans &amp; Friends,

&gt;good news from Mastersound Studio!

&gt;We are in the midst of recording Leaves' Eyes new full-length album.

&gt;The album's concept is rooted in a highly important chapter in the history of Norway. The sagas of Norway's kings and the middle-ages has always been of great interest to me and it's such a pleasure to compose and record this huge soundtrack with my dream team here at Mastersound Studio. Thanx to my guys for these enchanting tunes and killer production!
The album will be released in the second half of 2015.

&gt;More news will follow soon!

&gt;Love,

Looks like a return to the band's more traditional theme; I rather liked Symphonies of the Night and would've liked had they continued to do something different like that, but I suppose this should be good too."

"Blind Guardian - Making of the new album, episode 3",""
"Blind Guardian - Making of the new album, episode 3","&gt;After discussing it, it became obvious that, on the last album, we took a step into the right direction with songs like [*Sacred Worlds*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFZ_Uyqbr4k), [*Wheel of Time*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_ts8cPScXM). Our kind of Blind Guardian metal blended together perfectly with a grand orchestra.

&amp;nbsp; 

Those two songs are insanely good. I'm really happy the band agrees and wants to make more stuff like that. "
"Blind Guardian - Making of the new album, episode 3","One of the things I really love about Wheel of Time is how much the orchestra takes the lead over the guitars. The short song previews at the end of this, but especially at the end of the making of trailer episode 2 sound absolutely incredible.

Edit: I just realized it's the same preview at the end of both trailers. Anyway, I can't wait to hear that whole song!"
"Blind Guardian - Making of the new album, episode 3","Yeah that preview sounds really good, which is somewhat of a relief because I found the recently released single to be rather lacking in the symphonic department. 

Another thing that is great about *Wheel of Time* is that the book series is every bit as good as the song is!"
"Blind Guardian - Making of the new album, episode 3","&gt; I found the recently released single to be rather lacking in the symphonic department

Which I think is to be expected with some (if not most) of the other songs on this upcoming album. Blind Guardian is a power metal band first and foremost. Yet, they are able to blend in symphonic and prog metal elements pretty flawlessly in some songs. If I recall correctly, only *Sacred Worlds* and *Wheel of Time* had heavy use of orchestration on their last album, while other songs like *Tanelorn* and *Ride into Obsession* are pretty much straight power metal.  

So basically, I really only expect *The Ninth Wave* and *The Grand Parade* to have heavy use of orchestration. However, I could be wrong as they've only been experimenting with orchestrations since the last album. Also, I think this might be the first album to use choirs so it will be an interesting album indeed. I can't wait."
"Blind Guardian - Making of the new album, episode 3","I definitely agree. I think the single will fit in a similar spot on the album as A Voice in the Dark did: the song meant to appeal to the widest part of their fan base."

* [Matenrou Opera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72RbMHylx2M) - quite similar to versailles.. you'll like them... 
* [Galneryus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFoljzvePs) - high-tempo modern power metal, less symphonic, that's more 'masculine'. very loved band by power metla fans
* [Liv Moon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyh13P4F8ss) - a women-fronted band.. kinda like early nightwish sound with anette vocals... 

Also, not japanese but I find [Serenity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2QH9L42OY0) has a bit of a similar style "
"Any more bands like them? Versailles - Aristocrat's Symphony","I'll second Galneryus.  They're awesome.  They used to be a lot more Visual Kei, not as much as Versailles was but still pretty crazy.  Their music is fantastic though.  I like to call them ""Japanovarius"" hehe."

90% or more of the viewers aren’t gonna understand the meaning of it, just like with the previous Les Fleurs du Mal related videos. No matter if you like, dislike or feel nothing about this clip, please do me a favour and share the clip all of you. You sharing it will be the final act of the Art Project.

The Art Project is hereby ended. I have explained some small things about it in the Secrets Revealed on the latest DVD and in interviews. I have started to write a short book about the rest of it for those who are interested. It has been an interesting experience. Maybe I do something similar for the 50 year anniversary.
Now I just look forward to work hard on finishing the Rock Opera this year. (via https://www.facebook.com/chris.vontherion?fref=ts )

The art project to me has seemed to be a lot of time and money spent on making videos that are weird for the sake of weird that could've better gone towards their music, but they can do what they want, it's just a shame that their last really good album was released over 10 years ago."

"[NSFW] Therion - Initials BB [Official Video] - The end of the art project (comments for more info)","All I can say for sure is Therion's most recent full length album is all covers of old-ish French pop songs, from what I've heard funded entirely out of pocket by Christofer for the sake of pursuing an extended art project. I have no idea what any of the lyrics are either but the album itself is quite good. This video is the culmination of that project."
"[NSFW] Therion - Initials BB [Official Video] - The end of the art project (comments for more info)","Like the other songs on the Flowers of Evil album, Initials BB was also a 60s pop song sharing a link with Brigitte Bardot, who inspired the original writer of Initials BB by throwing the book *L'Amour Monstre* and pointing out that each page said ""whips: lash"" (presumably in the form of stage instructions, though the wiki article isn't clear). This would explain the video's lashings. The song's lyrics themselves are from Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Raven"". I assume a deeper knowledge of the book, the poem, and how the original song came to be would help to explain the video a lot more."

"Does anyone know if Epica have plans to tour in Australia in 2015?","I am wondering the same thing for the United States since their 2014 tour here was cancelled for reasons beyond their control... Still no news even though it's been months :("
"Does anyone know if Epica have plans to tour in Australia in 2015?","Simone just said on Twitter that they are planning a new US and Canada tour, so that's good news at least! Hope it won't be too long before they can give some details."
"Does anyone know if Epica have plans to tour in Australia in 2015?","I just saw that!! My day instantly got much better amidst the stress of finals."
"Does anyone know if Epica have plans to tour in Australia in 2015?","My guess would be that they might organise US and Australia shows for next autumn/winter (after festival season). At least I hope so for all the fans there. Or I suppose they might be able to fit it in before the festivals. 

I've not heard anything concrete either, although the band certainly said they would try to reschedule the US dates at some point."

"Sirenia - Perils of the Deep Blue","I got this album few months ago along with **Wild Card** - *ReVamp* and **War of Ages** - *Serenity*. On first listen I didn't really get it and I left it to collect dust... Until I found out that they shot the video for **Seven Widows Weep** in my town. I gave it another chance and I must say that it is great. I like almost all songs. Some of my favourites are **Profound Scars**, **Funeral March** and **Decadence**. 

With almost six months past, what do you think of it now?"
"Sirenia - Perils of the Deep Blue","It's much, *much* better than the The Enigma of Life. My favourite is Ditt Endelikt, such a great song. It's not as good as Nine Destinies and a Downfall (my favourite, I don't understand why many people don't like it), but still really good."
"Sirenia - Perils of the Deep Blue","My favourite album is 13th Floor. It's the first album of Sirenia I've ever heard and it stuck with me. I also like The Enigma of Life. I don't see why people dislike it. I really enjoy all songs, they are not great, but they are good. "
"Sirenia - Perils of the Deep Blue","I absolutely love the intro (Ducere Me in Lucem), and apart from that, my favorites are Seven Widows Weep, Profound Scars, and Blue Colleen. Overall, I like this album a lot more than any of their others."
"Sirenia - Perils of the Deep Blue","I really love the album. Their others all had individual songs that I liked a lot, but I never listened to them much as a whole. I agreed with many other people that The Enigma of Life was a bit of a disappointment, though again there were a few songs I loved. Perils of the Deep Blue is just such a big step up, it's cohesive and atmospheric and Ailyn has improved her vocals no end. It's definitely a contender for their best album!"
"Sirenia - Perils of the Deep Blue","I haven't listened the album much but I like it more than The Enigma of Life which was quite terrible in my opinion.

I have liked what I've heard from Perils of the Deep Blue except the sound on the album is bad in my opinion. Bass and guitar don't form an unified 'wall of sound' like for example on Nine Destinies. Also the drums sound plastic and quite lifeless compared to Nine Destinies or the albums before it. The 13th Floor also suffers slightly from the same issue but it isn't as notable on it."

"Elize Ryd - Nemo (Official Nightwish Cover)","Many of us ""the most passionate Tarja fans"" have been listening Tarja since Angels fall first and Oceanborn, for some of us the better part of our teenage years. There is very little any replacement rock chick can do to fill the boots of someone like that - sucks for those who have started listening Nightwish more recently, but our preference for Tarja is deep rooted and those roots are not running in rational grounds."

"Pick no more than 5 songs that you think best represent the genre of symphonic metal.","[Turisas - ""Miklagard Overture""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OQ_hQXRRMA) - most representative of the epic saga style, with clean and harsh male vocals in even distribution, full orchestral arrangement, and choir.

[Epica - ""Chasing the Dragon""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bidIrp1gZoc) - acoustic and clean vocals that gradually transitions to the more typical heavier sound, while maintaining a clearly common melodic theme throughout. This differs from the rather more abrupt partition between ""gentle' and ""heavy"" in Epica's newer albums.

[Therion - ""Clavicula Nox"" live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLcuWskuFuY) - I chose this one not just to represent the ballad style, but also for the visuals to give the viewer/listening a more complete experience as to how well the genre can be adapted to a full orchestra (and orchestra only!).

[Almora - ""Kiyamet Senfonisi"" {Judgement Symphony}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZPZ2WK6hDA) - Almora's no longer around, but for a while they were one of the best (well, perhaps only) Turkish symphonic metal bands. When it comes to symphonic metal, people usually think of Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, and some parts of East Asia - very few think of Turkey. The leader of the band continues to do orchestral arrangements after the band's disbandment.

I think these are the some of the most representative songs in terms of diversity. Despite being a subgenre, symphonic metal is very diverse and has multiple ""flavors""/""sub-subgenres"" to it and there are lots of great bands doing very different things in terms of style and sound.

Also, Diablo Swing Orchestra isn't really a symphonic metal band (they're really avant-garde/experimental with all kinds of different influences), but the orchestral/symphonic element is one of their main things.

"Pick no more than 5 songs that you think best represent the genre of symphonic metal.","Great topic! Hmm, like others have said, this is a tricky one because it depends who you're trying to represent it to. I think I'll go with an imaginary metalhead who is vaguely aware of the genre... And I'll try not to just pick my favourite songs!

- Epica - *The Essence of Silence*. I think this is a good one for demonstrating the ""beauty and the beast"" style. I've found a lot of people who are into heavy music will enjoy Epica.
- Within Temptation - *The Truth Beneath The Rose*. I particularly like the Black Symphony version of this for showing people how epic the music can be live.
- Leaves' Eyes - *Frøya's Theme*. I kind of think almost any LE song would be a good representation of the genre but this one is just glorious.
- Kamelot - *Soul Society* or Serenity - *Wings of  Madness*. Cheating a bit but I think there should be a male lead vocalist in the list and I can't pick between the two...
- Nightwish - *Ghost Love Score*. An obvious one and it is my favourite song, but I think it's the pinnacle of the genre. I have a preference for Floor's version, especially the Argentina performance.

"Pick no more than 5 songs that you think best represent the genre of symphonic metal.","**Epica - The Obsessive Devotion**.
Epica shows some of the heavier sides of the symphonic spectrum. Really good juxtaposition of grunts and operatic vocals, and heavy on the orchestra.


**Diabulus In Musica - Ex Nihilo**.
Like Epica, this is heavier with the grunts and driving drums. But this song has a particularly strong choir aspect to it, which I love. Her vocals are also more airy and gentle.


**Nightwish - Ghost Love Score**.
We need to throw in an epic one. This is undoubtedly one of the best. I love Nightwish because they take full advantage of choir, orchestra and woodwind section as most other symphonic bands stick to orchestral arrangements, Nightwish just does whatever they please. 


**Kamelot - Song for Jolee**.
Two reasons this is necessary. I want to include a male singer, and I think Tommy is the best. Also, we need a ballad. Symphonic metal, and especially Kamelot, shows a lot musical theater influence in their work and this song sounds like it could be straight out of a musical. "

"
"I created this video to explain what symphonic metal is: The Elements of Symphonic Metal","You point out a main aspect of this genre that i honestly dislike. Keyboards. Its a very fine line between symphonic and power metal which most bands actually sound like. I have yet to hear a real symphonic metal sound as heard in Versailles/Jupiter. They actually have songs that sound like a orchestra piece turned into metal. When i heard about this genre i was excited to find more bands like them but most sound way to power metalish. I have found a few like epica, nightwish, kamelot,  and rhapsody but thats about it."
"I created this video to explain what symphonic metal is: The Elements of Symphonic Metal","I think cost is a huge factor in this - most bands can't afford an orchestra. This means that they have to use keyboards or synths for their melodies. I mean, when Nightwish started out they recorded their albums at school on almost no budget, hence why they could only use their own instruments for the most part.

Sometimes bands do find a way around this - especially now we have crowdfunding, more bands are going to be able to use orchestras and to learn how to incorporate them into the music. 

You might enjoy the later albums of Xandria and Serenity, by the way, if you haven't heard them already - I enjoy their orchestral elements, personally."

"For those who like epica","I recently found epica and bought their design your universe album. I fell in love! I absolutely love this album. Especially kingdom of Heaven. But, I wanted to know what Album of theirs do you guys like? as a new listener to them what other albums should I get? "
"For those who like epica","They just released The Quantum Enigma, which is fantastic. My personal favorite is probably The Divine Conspiracy though.

[Fools of Damnation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csYBwZPCleY) - My favorite off The Divine Conspiracy

[Second Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMkyWaYwBA) - From the Quantum Enigma, probably becoming my favorite Epica song of all time"
"For those who like epica","In my opinion, Design Your Universe is absolutely unbeatable as an album. It is for sure my favorite album by Epica, and probably my even my favorite album of all time by any artist. That being said, The Quantum Enigma comes damn close. I think that Requiem for the Indifferent was their weakest album overall, but I still loved over half of the songs on it. And the other three (The Phantom Agony, Consign to Oblivion, and The Divine Conspiracy) all have very unique sounds from each other and are wonderful in their own ways.

My advice is to listen to their entire discography. Chances are you won't regret it. :)"
"For those who like epica","All of their later albums are great, but the early stuff isn't bad either. My favourite Epica album at the moment is *The Quantum Enigma*, which was released this year. *The Divine Conspiracy*, *Design Your Universe*, and *Requiem for the Indifferent* are all great too.

Their earliest albums have some really good stuff, but they're not as good as the later ones. Simone's voice has noticeably improved over time and so have the overall writing and production.

Here are two amazing songs from the latest album: [The Essence of Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oePrtEMmX9Y) and [Unchain Utopia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8y99z5EVtY)."
"For those who like epica","They are all amazing, I personally find their last album to be the least good. Design your universe is by far the best, the song and the album, and Requiem for the Indifferent is GREAT, containing the only song that can compete with Design your universe, Serenade of Self-Destruction. 

I personally find these two albums masterful in comparison to their other albums."
"For those who like epica","So, this wasnt meant as a reaction to stefankruithof (u dutch?) but to OP, sry for misplacement "
"For those who like epica","No I'm not Dutch but I like hearing songs in other languages and looking up the translation online. "
"For those who like epica","I am Dutch though :-)"
"For those who like epica","thought so cause of ur name, me too, going to epica in Utrecht next month :D"
"For those who like epica","Their latest 3 albums are the best ones, I think, with The Quantum Enigma being superior to the other 2."
"For those who like epica","Personally, Requiem for the Indifferent is my favourite. It is probably their most progressive album and I am a huge prog fan so that is probably why it is my favourite. If I were you I would start at The Phantom Agony and eventually work your way up to The Quantum Enigma because all of their albums are great in their own way."
"For those who like epica","Finally someone who agrees that RFTI is the best... but really, Epica is the only band where I like almost every song on every album. "
"For those who like epica","My favorite is Design Your Universe, but The Divine Conspiracy holds a special place in my heart for being one of the (if not THE) very first Symph. Power Metal albums I ever got into as a whole, instead of just songs here-and-there.

Best song from The Divine Conspiracy in my opinion is [Chasing the Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWQAIO9CdFk). Very slow and progressively builds up to an insanely powerful climax, and shows off Simone's voice very well."
"For those who like epica","Like BadWolf89 said, I think you should listen to their entire discography.  All of their albums are worth listening to, and each of them has a unique sound. And if you liked Kingdom of Heaven, I'd say also check out [Consign to Oblivion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVDKjeI4__M) ( I mean the song, but you should also check out the whole album :P )."
"For those who like epica","Agreed. Consign to Oblivion has long been my favorite Epica album, but The Quantum Enigma is trying really hard to take its place. "
"For those who like epica","I think The Divine Conspiracy is still my favorite. I haven't listened to The Quantum Enigma yet, though."
"For those who like epica","My favorite is Requiem for the Indifferent... it stays dark, heavy, and progressive til the end. The only real drawback is the mixing/mastering is not as good as their other albums. However, as others have said, all the albums are definitely worth a listen. RFTI takes the longest to fully appreciate, and CTO is probably the easiest to get into. I don't like a couple of the songs on their newest album, such as ""Unchain Utopia"" and ""Omen"", plus most of ""Reverance"" even though the intro and verses are excellent, the chorus is just too repetitive. However, TQE has the best mastering of any of their albums and probably the best performance, instruments, and singing of any of their albums. Still, all of them are good. The closest to DYU is probably RFTI but as I have said, it is a lot darker. "
"For those who like epica","I am relativly new to Epica. So far my favorite album is the Quantum Enigma. Best songs are Chemical Insomnia, and Essence of Silence. :D"
"For those who like epica","You basically have their best album, although I have to echo what everyone is saying about Quantum Enigma. Good stuff there.

Other than that, I recommend Cosign to Oblivion, then the following (which is personal opinion);

"Has Symphonic Metal been a bonding experience for anyone else?","Going to see Sonata Arctica with my dad Tuesday and it really dawned on me that symphonic metal has been a bonding experience for us. It started with an off chance day where I had just discovered symphonic metal via Nightwish and the album Once. His car was in the shop so he needed a ride to work, and I had known about Nightwish for a couple days and had the album Once playing. When Planet Hell came on he got this look of amazement of his face and asked what this was because it sounded amazing. I told him about it and ever since then he and I have had a common musical interest with all these bands like Nightwish, Kamelot, Delain, etc. we have been front row for Nightwish (w/Floor), front row for Kamelot (w/Tommy), and coming Tuesday hopefully front row for Sonata Arctica. And no I am not embarrassed or anything that my dad is up there rocking it out with me. lol

Thank you Symphonic Metal! :) just something I wanted to get off my chest. If anyone sees a guy with a limp and a balding older man with a mustache at the concert in Orlando Tuesday, say hello. :p"
"Has Symphonic Metal been a bonding experience for anyone else?","On my first day of university I was feeling really shit. I was going to one of my classes, and came downstairs in my dorms to see a guy wearing a Nightwish hoodie, and because sometimes my brain/mouth filter doesn't work, I shouted ""Nightwish!""

He's been one of my best friends for 3 years."
"Has Symphonic Metal been a bonding experience for anyone else?","That's awesome."
"Has Symphonic Metal been a bonding experience for anyone else?","None of my friends like symphonic metal, and all the people I meet who do like it seem to hate the bands I like. ""Sonata Arctica? Nightwish? You're such a casual, here's some (unpronounceable, extremely obscure band) for you to learn from."" I hate to put a negative spin on such a thread, but I have seen more snobbery in this genre than any other, and I have learned to be shameful of my musical tastes. What am I doing wrong?"
"Has Symphonic Metal been a bonding experience for anyone else?","I hear you, got the same problem. There really is no shame in liking the ""big bands"", they are big for a reason! Only listening to obscure bands is just being a hipster. I love Sonata Arctica and Nightwish, plenty of other big names, and plenty of obscure bands. I usually hang out at /r/PowerMetal, and I notice some snobbery over there as well (mainly, if you don't share the opinions of the ""veterans"" who have been there for a long time, they will go apeshit). I really dislike how people must assert their disapproval of others' opinions, while expecting unconditional respect for the opinions they themselves lord over others."
"Has Symphonic Metal been a bonding experience for anyone else?","There's elitist symphonic metal fans? That's rather interesting. Or did you just mean fans of metal in general? I mean, I've met plenty of people who hate symphonic metal because they think it's not heavy or obscure enough, but never people who were fans of the subgenre but only liked unknown bands - if you see what I mean.

But I would definitely say that you are not doing anything wrong. People being elitist about anything are just looking for an excuse to define themselves as slightly better than someone else, and this is something I've had to learn the hard way from hanging round with too many people like that. Often they hate on things without even having really tried them. I remember a guy saying ""I hate symphonic metal, it all sounds the same."" ""What bands have you tried?"" I asked. ""Lacuna Coil?"" was his reply. That was the only one he could think of, and they're not even a symphonic band! 

It used to upset me so much that people dismissed the music I loved, but I eventually realised that if they wanted to miss out on it, it was their choice. The best successes I've had with bonding over symphonic metal were either converting existing friends to like it, meeting people at the concerts or chatting to others online. There are a ton of fans out there, they just might not be in your area - or if they are, they might not be advertising it because they might have been made to feel just as ashamed as you have. And that makes me sad. Symphonic metal is a wonderful and varied genre, don't let anyone tell you otherwise!"
"Has Symphonic Metal been a bonding experience for anyone else?","Metal has so many genres and sub genres, it sparks a lot of in fighting. And elitism is elitism is elitism. You aren't doing anything wrong. It's just the way things are. Enjoy the music you like and screw anyone who puts you down for it. I don't care if it's Nickelback and Justin Beiber. lol"
"Has Symphonic Metal been a bonding experience for anyone else?","I make my dad listen to some metal from time to time. He only enjoys symphonic metal, even if there's some growling. But any other kind, if there's growling or shredding or something, he starts telling me how bad this music sounds and how irritating it is.

I don't know what it is that makes him like it more though. Maybe it's the mostly female vocals or the nice music. Have fun this Tuesday!"
"Has Symphonic Metal been a bonding experience for anyone else?","About six years ago I was at work and sitting with a few people I didn't know because I just got off sick leave. About half way through the shift, someone's phone goes off and I recognize the song. I said, ""What song is that?"" And he said, ""It's called Bye Bye Beautiful, I don't know if you would have heard of it."" I felt my face light up and I sat up straight in my chair. ""Nightwish?!"" He gets the same look on his face as I did mine and says, ""Yeah!"" We've been friends ever since and we're going to the Nightwish concert in Toronto along with another friend in April. =)"
"Has Symphonic Metal been a bonding experience for anyone else?","My girlfriend and I are both fans of symphonic metal and have been since before we got together, over ten years ago. I wouldn't say the music has been a bonding experience, but it's one of those things that we share. "

I felt kinda bad for Xandria/Delain/Sonara Arctica that they couldn't even fill a small venue. Made me sad to see a great chain venue (House of Blues), in a major city (Orlando), in Downtown Disney, less than half full.

But you know what? Despite poor attendance, all three bands played their asses of for us. I'd even go so far as saying Xandria, the first ones on stage, totally stole the show. No one phoned in their performances. Was a great night."
"Has Symphonic Metal been a bonding experience for anyone else?","In my opinion symphonic metal is the odd metal genre since people who usually listen to metal look down on it (they say is too soft or sth), and people who listen to other genres don't like it because it is metal...

In my country there are almost no concerts with symphonic metal bands, my favorite band Diablo Swing Orchestra never set foot in my country, and even if there were concerts like this I have no1 to go with..."

So right now, Tuomas's solo album is still my album of the year (I had such an emotional response to it and instantly liked it) but I have a feeling that if people ask me at the end of the year I'll say TQE."

"A wrong sending later, finally received my Quantum Enigma earbook! Can't wait to listen.","Agreed - been listening to it and Sacrificium on repeat all day and it's starting to stick, starting with the instrumental tracks to get the melody lines and then adding the vocals on top to fill in the details. 

They're definitely not as quick to grasp as Epica's earlier works like Phantom Agony and Divine Conspiracy, though, where the melodies of the vocals and orchestra take on such a prominent role in the songs that you pick them up right away ('hummable' tunes, if you will). I guess some of us are still hoping they return to that earlier style, though it's highly unlikely. "
"A wrong sending later, finally received my Quantum Enigma earbook! Can't wait to listen.","It really is phenomenal."
"A wrong sending later, finally received my Quantum Enigma earbook! Can't wait to listen.","Even the bonus tracks. Every song is amazing. "
"A wrong sending later, finally received my Quantum Enigma earbook! Can't wait to listen.","I thought it was alright, but it just didn't hook me for some reason. I love the heavy vocals, but I dunno. I'm gonna give it a few more listens. Hopefully it grows on me a bit.

My album of the year right now is Insomnium's ""Shadows of the Dying Sun""."
"A wrong sending later, finally received my Quantum Enigma earbook! Can't wait to listen.","I've noticed that there's a bit of a fan divide. I think it might be because Simone was a mezzo-soprano before, but with this album her range is full soprano, and that means she sounds different. is that maybe it?

also, Insomnium are goddamn wonderful"
"A wrong sending later, finally received my Quantum Enigma earbook! Can't wait to listen.","Honestly, I'm not sure. I mean, I didn't think it was bad by any means, it just didn't hook me like their other stuff has. Besides the single they released before, I can't really remember specific songs off hand. It all sounded good, just couldn't get into it. But hey, I've only listened to it twice so far. I'll give it a few more goes and hopefully it grows on me soon.

Re Insomnium: Have you heard their new album yet?"
"A wrong sending later, finally received my Quantum Enigma earbook! Can't wait to listen.","not yet. Recommend a first-listen track?"
"A wrong sending later, finally received my Quantum Enigma earbook! Can't wait to listen.","The whole album is just amazing. Like not a bad song on it.

[The River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWJ6GxvFRM) is one of the heaviest songs they've ever done.

I also really like [Revelation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdB-8JlMgN8). The lyrics are beautiful.

If you want something unique, upbeat and as close to 'pop' as Insomnium will ever get, I recommend [Ephemeral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DjmQXtZUx4)."

Albums

1. The Phantom Agony - Honestly the lyrical work in this album is pretty awful. I'll blame it on the language barrier. Every band gets their fuck up and this one happens to be their debut.

2. Consign To Oblivion - Better with a few gems but still forgettable in my eyes. 

3. The Divine Conspiracy - Here is where they really try and experiment. I feel like some of the songs get lost in trying to attempt prog but lacking normal song structure doesn't make it prog. Vocals and everything else are pretty much on point though.

4. Design Your Universe - I consider this their best work. Symphonic metal masterpiece. Crisp sound quality. They don't stray off from the prog completely but it's topped off with great choir work and catchy choruses.

5. Requiem For The Indifferent - This album gets a lot of flak for the production quality (volume on guitar underwhelming). I can agree with that. It's definitely their proggiest album to date. Jansen's riffs just won me over for this album though.

6. The Quantum Enigma - Design Your Universe 2.0. This album sees the most choir use and it's AWESOME. The quality of vocals by Simone, choir and instrumentals really just live up to their name. Lyrically, it's much less preachy(If you're a fan you know what I'm talking about) and more uplifting. In other words this album fucking rocks.

**Feel free to discuss your opinions!**"
"My Guide To Epica: Their best songs and albums.","I think the Phantom Agony was some of Epica's best lyrical work. 

* Sensorium looks into the seeming futility of life and the search for meaning 
* While vague, Cry for the Moon is an interesting criticism of the Catholic Church and child abuse 
* Facade of Reality is a sharp criticism of radical Islam and the resulting 9/11 attacks on the United States
* The Phantom Agony discusses deep epistemological problems of what we can know about reality

And there are other songs with strong lyrics as well. It's not their strongest album musically, but I've always considered the lyrics a strength.  "
"My Guide To Epica: Their best songs and albums.","I think you are confusing what I meant. Their use of language is rather bland.   I'm not criticizing the message behind their work, just their way with words. If you look at their work from the recent years they have improved exponentially at expressing themselves lyrically. I love their message."
"My Guide To Epica: Their best songs and albums.","Okay, I can see what you mean. Some of the wording is a little clunky."

Never been to interested in criticism, but do people really don't like The Phantom Agony and Facade of Reality ? :o"
"My Guide To Epica: Their best songs and albums.","The Phantom Agony is one of my favorite tracks in their entire discography. In my opinion, the last two minutes or so with the orchestra and choir is the best classical piece that the band has ever produced."

"Xandria - 'Soulcrusher' (For Old Nightwish Fans)","I also adore this album, but I'd be interested to see them try something a bit different for the next album.

"Eihwaz - teaser for their new album BraveHeart. I hope it turns out as epic as it looks. (More links in comments)","Looks epic, but they seem to have a notable lack of support. They have an [Indigogo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/epic-symphonic-album-braveheart-by-eihwaz) for the album, but it's only 4% funded.

I listened to their last album ([iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/amadeus/id682537074), 
[Spotify](https://play.spotify.com/album/48NXkbGNGl1zV2hW3kHDKL)), and it seemed pretty good to me, at least for a debut album. It was short, but seemed well-produced, had some interesting melodies, and good vocals. I liked the artwork too.

"A guide to Stream of Passion?","So I've never listened to Stream of Passion, but I've been seeing them getting mentioned a lot lately with Epica and Xandria and I want to give them a proper listen. Wikipedia says they are a progressive metal band with symphonic/gothic elements. I'm not too big on prog metal, but I can deal with it if the music isn't overly complex. 

What album should I listen to first? Should I start from the beginning?"
"A guide to Stream of Passion?","I like Stream of Passion, and I own all of their albums. In my opinion, each new album is better than the previous one although they are all good. I really like ""Darker Days"" and the recently released ""A War of Our Own"". I think the band is more like Within Temptation or Delain than Xandria or Epica. Marcela's vocals are always beautiful and clean (not pseudo-operatic like Epica or Xandria though), and she occasionally sings in Spanish.

The first album ""Embrace the Storm"" is considerably different (most notably softer) from the rest. This is not necessarily bad, just don't judge the rest of the albums by it if you only listen to the first album. I'd recommend starting with any of the last three albums, especially the last two.

Edit: Grammar"
"A guide to Stream of Passion?","Thank you! I'm also a huge fan of Within Temptation and Delain so I think I'll like Stream of Passion. I think I'll skip ""Embrace the Storm"" for now and maybe come back to it. I think I'll start with ""The Flame Within"" and go on from there, especially if they tend to get better with every new album.   

Edit: I just listened to ""The Flame Within"" and I really liked it. Marcela has a beautiful voice. I think I'm really going to like the next two albums."
"A guide to Stream of Passion?","I might add that *A War of Our Own* is a much darker and more sombre album than the previous ones. The violin, which usually produces some quick and high notes to lift things up, has lower and slower melodies. "
"EX DEO - I, Caligvla [Symphonic death]",""
"EX DEO - I, Caligvla [Symphonic death]","Love this tune. Prolly the only one I like by them though."

"Diablo Swing Orchestra Parts With Vocalist","I'm guessing this is her: http://www.kristinevegard.se/ 

Her Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUL1K7BTc5zXjRUR1D2wIpTA

Nothing obvious that screams DSO in there, but I think I can see how they could fit. "
"Diablo Swing Orchestra Parts With Vocalist","Yeah I'm not finding it obvious either, but I can't wait to see how they sound with her!"
"Diablo Swing Orchestra Parts With Vocalist","To me Annlouice's vocals were the main attraction of Diablo Swing Orchestra. From what I've been able to find of her replacement they're not going with a similar operatic style."
"Diablo Swing Orchestra Parts With Vocalist","Well at least this one's attractive"
"Dreambleed - Hopeless (feat. Mark Jansen of Epica)",""
"How is this not here? Kamelot - Karma - [5:04]",""
"How is this not here? Kamelot - Karma - [5:04]","OP's desperation for karma has lead to ever decreasing levels of subtlety, it appears.

A fine song though. Just leave pointless stuff out of the title next time."
"Carach Angren - These Fields Are Lurking (Symphonic Black) Very Impressive!",""
"Carach Angren - These Fields Are Lurking (Symphonic Black) Very Impressive!","Nice! Love these guys, did you notice a slight drop in the production for this album? I always found Lammendam to be their best quality production. Only slight though, the later albums still kick fucking ass."
"Carach Angren - These Fields Are Lurking (Symphonic Black) Very Impressive!","In my Opinion the drop is barely noticeable (As you said) and it doesn't bother me much. I just recently discovered them and love all of their albums."
"Epica - Never Enough",""
"Epica - Never Enough","the first song I ever listened to by Epica.
it's such a great song!"
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","The best example I can give for what I'm looking for is the orchestral versions of Wildpath's songs in the album album Underneath. In the album it sounds pretty much like an orchestral recreation of the songs. Are there any other bands that do this same thing?"
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","Do you just mean orchestral versions of symphonic metal songs? Sorry if I'm misinterpreting. You can get the orchestral versions of some of the Nightwish and Epica albums on special editions of the CDs - or if you can't get hold of those some of them are up on YouTube or Spotify."
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","Yes, orchestral versions of symphonic metal band's songs. Preferably done by the original band, but if it sounds good I'll listen."
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","Nightwish has released a purely orchestral version of Imaginaerum and has also released instrumentals (includes band) of the aforementioned album and DPP. Epica had also released instrumentals of their latest two albums, but no orchestrals. So, you might want to check those out. "
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","Aha, there we go, I was being stupid and thinking that my 3cd edition of TQE was instrumental and orchestral but it's acoustic and instrumental, isn't it?

Nightwish created an orchestral CD for Once but it's very rare. However I believe you can hear it at least some of it on YouTube and the band did officially upload the orchestral Ghost Love Score."
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","I believe the earbook version of TQE contained a CD that was solely instrumental and another one that contained the acoustic songs and a bonus track. 

I've been trying to look for the orchestral version of Once for ages. All I've found were snippets of some of the songs on YouTube :/ "
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","I remember Tuomas's official site giving away the orchestral Once CD in a chat competition a while back. I was so sad that I didn't win! The person who did was lovely though, so that made me feel a little better."
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","You should have gotten them to torrent it! "
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","Haha, I remember at the time plenty of people asked her to do that, but the admins pointed out that they would know exactly who leaked it and she'd be in big trouble."
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","Darn... That's cruddy... I like the orchestration in Dark Chest of Wonders especially near the end... not much flute in other bands like this. "
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","If you don't mind other languages, Soner Canozer, who led the Turkish symphonic metal band Almora before it broke up, re-did many of that band's songs with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra in the album *Masalci'nin On Beş Yılı*, or Storyteller's 15 Years, referring to Canozer's time as a songwriter.

Here's one of the songs, Kıyamet Senfonisi (Judgement Symphony): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a50K9_7LhI8 "
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","Are these songs on Spotify? If so, what artist should I search for?"
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","No idea as to Spotify, but many of the songs are on Youtube (you may have to try different versions that'll work in your country). Search for the artist, Soner Canozer, and the album name I wrote above. You don't have to get the Turkish characters correct.

Here's one Youtube guy who seems to have uploaded all the songs, though he didn't create a playlist so you'll have to go through one after another using the side suggestions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TtE5tYgR5A"
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","It is on Spotify, thanks. I'll give it a listen!"
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","I will add that you might also want to look up ""acoustic"" versions of existing bands' songs. They don't use an orchestra, but the sound is very different from the regular versions. I particularly like Epica's [Natural Corruption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEOmDUQaH5A), the acoustic version of which uses an accordion."
"Looking for a certain genre within this genre","Sonata Arctica released an [orchestral version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnB5W2LK4A0) of *The Days of Grays* that you might like."

"Congrats to Amanda Somerville and Sander Gommans!","For anyone who doesn't know who these two are, Amanda is the vocalist of Trillium and is also known for her solo career as well as her extensive work in the genre as a singer, vocal coach, producer, choir conductor and more. She's worked with After Forever, Epica, Kamelot, Edguy and Luca Turilli. Sander was a founding member of After Forever and was the main writer and guitarist for AF and Trillium. They got engaged in August last year. Big congrats to them!"

For most of the songs at least, the better they are in studio the ""worse"" they are live (aka Essence of Silence here, really not convinced, still a good song but ...) !"
"Epica - Live at Pinkpop 2014 (Full Show)","I saw a comment on that video saying that they make it so it sounds better in the venue, which is why you can't really hear the choirs and orchestration. But I've always thought that their vocals are weaker live as well, much as I love them."

"Trans Siberian Orchestra?","A Mad Russian's Christmas is pretty awesome too."
"Trans Siberian Orchestra?","I've been to their concerts several times - in my opinion they're spectacular and I absolutely love them. The performers love to interact with the audience. It's a super fun show and a good time for all. I would highly recommend seeing them if you have the chance. "
"Trans Siberian Orchestra?","I'm going to see them for the fifth times when they come to Chicago. The concerts are a lot of fun. A lot of special effects and they put on a great show with a ton of talent. It blows my mind that they put on two shows a day and still do autographs for free after the show. I don't know how they do it. Tickets are worth every penny and if you can pick one up do it. "
"Trans Siberian Orchestra?","They do an awesome live show, and it's kinda fun to see young kids and old ladies alike turning out for what is effectively a symphonic metal/rock concert. Last time I went to see them in Milwaukee or Chicago about 5 years ago the first half of their act was basically a rather-dull concept album, but the second half of the show more than made up for it. Definitely worth the trip. "

"Thoughts on Xandria's Sacrificium?","I really like it. It's a little different than Neverworld's End, but still a great album. I also like Dianne's voice, it's not as powerful as Manuela's but still very good. Curious what others think..."
"Thoughts on Xandria's Sacrificium?","Neverworld's End is easily in my top 3 albums ever, Sacrificium was certainly a very good album but they set a really high standard that's hard to beat. Got a really strong Epica vibe off of a lot of songs."
"Thoughts on Xandria's Sacrificium?","I know exactly what you mean. Although, that's not to say that Epica vibes are a detractor. Manuela's voice was perfect for Xandria, but I think that Dianne is a solid replacement."
"Thoughts on Xandria's Sacrificium?","Also, is it just me or does Little Red Relish sound *really* similar to Firestorm?"
"Thoughts on Xandria's Sacrificium?","Yep, that was my first thought too."

"Thoughts on Xandria's Sacrificium?","I'm really enjoying it so far. I know a lot of people are going to say following Neverworld's End is tough but I think this one is just as good. Honestly, I like Dianne's voice a bit more. 
My personal favorite song on it is Betrayer."

"Within Temptation to headline Saturday night at Bloodstock festival.","I was so not expecting this. I was never able to go to Bloodstock when I was younger, and when I finally could go they mostly stopped having any of my favourite bands. I would love so much to be able to go... maybe I'll manage a day ticket. Within Temptation and Opeth is a pretty great evening on its own."
"Within Temptation to headline Saturday night at Bloodstock festival.","I'm curious, how do you feel about Opeth's style change?"
"Within Temptation to headline Saturday night at Bloodstock festival.","I'm not a big fan of it, because I have never particularly liked prog... It's like listening to a whole different band in a way. I think it's fair enough if they want to explore any kind of music they want, I guess they've just accepted that they will probably alienate old fans but gain new ones."
"Within Temptation to headline Saturday night at Bloodstock festival.","I heard them on Copenhell this year, and i really don't find them that good live. I love their studio records, but (IMO) it didn't look like they enjoyed plaing live. Also they had just abid to much playback for my taste."

I have one question: is Laura Macri more prevalent on this album than she was on the last, or is she just in a few songs? I know she does Insano and I love that song, but I hope she's on more songs.  "
"Loving this album! | MaYaN - Redemption (Feat. Floor Jansen)","Unfortunately, she's not as prevalent. Asides from ""Insano"" she gets a few small parts here and there. I think Mark mentioned he wanted to focus more on the male vocals than rely on female vocals, which is why Floor also gets very small parts in the few songs that she sings in. "

"Loving this album! | MaYaN - Redemption (Feat. Floor Jansen)","I'd honestly give it an 85/100. It's a great album that definitely surpasses  ""Quarterpast"" and even Epica's RFTI. In fact this album sounds more like a successor to “Design Your Universe” but a bit heavier. "

Different vocal style to Tarja's version but I like this more."
"Nightwish - Ever Dream (Live at Wacken 2013)","I agree. I'm not a huge fan of their recent albums, which make up most of the set list. But Floor's vocals performance is outstanding. Great DVD."
"Nightwish - Ever Dream (Live at Wacken 2013)","I adore Floor's voice and I think this whole live album is amazing, but on this song it sounds to me like she's straining, especially at the end. Disclaimer - I know nothing about the technicalities of singing, lol. I think it's possibly because it's quite high and she's trying to belt it rather than sing it in ""operatic"" style?"
"Nightwish - Ever Dream (Live at Wacken 2013)","I can see what you mean.
Personally, it sounds to me like she's just giving it her all but I can see why that would be slightly offputting."
"Nightwish - Ever Dream (Live at Wacken 2013)","I think you're right about that :)"
"Nightwish - Ever Dream (Live at Wacken 2013)","She's actually belting the last notes, which means she's bringing her chest voice up to sing in that higher register. This is what's actually surprising about the performance because unlike Tarja, who would transition to her head to facilitate singing higher, Floor is singing with much more energy to sing those high notes with her chest voice.  "

But I rarely see it discussed or mentioned. I was expecting it to at least be brought back up as a ""Best of 2014"" but it seems its early in the year release had it fade from everyone's minds. Why isn't it talked about more? Is it not ""symphonic metal"" enough? That seems to be the chorus around here lately, for a lot of things.

I think it's an incredible album. And the reviews agree with me."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","For one, just because the reviews pass something flying colors doesn't mean that the public will feel the same. Critics are people not an entire society. There are countless movies that are praised by critics but hated by audiences and visa versa. If you like it, then fine. However, I wouldn't shield behind critics too much. While we rely on critics to give up an idea of what a product is like in order to inform us on whether something is worth our money; somethings they just don't know what they are talking about. It's best to create your own opinion as best as you can by yourself after you've experienced something. 

I, for one, think Hydra wasn't that great of an album. It's no Mother Earth or The Heart of Everything. Two of their albums in which I absolutely love. Hydra, to me, lacks identity. Nothing in it states it's a Within Temptation piece. There wasn't any style using motives, rifts, cadences, etc. that makes my brain light up and go ""oh it's Within Temptation!"" If anything Hydra feels like it's someone else's album. Everything felt like such a big departure. If I had to call it anything it felt a bit ""safe"". They had a style going and it seems like they want to abandon it. Perhaps to make themselves more appealing beyond the metal audience? If so then that would explain ""And We Run"" and the cover of ""Radioactive"". Two song of which boggle my mind on why they even exist in this album. However, I do not know Within Temptation motives for the future or their roadmap. All I know is that I did not end up enjoying this album. Hopefully, I will have better feelings towards their next album. "
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","All their covers are from the Q Sessions. They're not songs on Hydra. And I don't think you understand what ""safe"" means. Safe means doing something familiar."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","The special edition of Hydra included a bunch of the covers, that might be what they're thinking of. I believe the covers were done as a promo for that radio station because they sponsored Elements."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","I'll give you the Q Sessions. I honestly didn't know. I'm not the biggest follower of Within Temptation. Really, I didn't even know about Hydra until I saw it on the rack at F.Y.E.

The reason I put safe in quotes is mainly because I couldn't find a word that fits what I'm trying to say. If safe means an artist isn't pushing the envelope and see how they can develop their craft, then Hydra wasn't even in the envelope. To me, Within Temptation took everything out of the envelope and stuck it in a new one. Pretty much to a point where you might as well have slapped a new band name on the cover. "
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","They have many Symphonic Metal songs on the album. Don't let a featured rapper on a song make you hate it."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","I'm not saying the songs in the album weren't by definition symphonic metal. Nor is the album not symphonic metal. Everything is symphonic metal. However, the style doesn't feel like Within Temptation. Instead the style feels like it belongs to someone else's symphonic metal band. It's a style that I frankly don't enjoy and is the reason why I didn't end up liking the album. It wasn't the rapper who did the entire album in. Though, the rapper did kill the entire song, but that's because I can't stand Rap.  "
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","So is this what this Subreddit has become? Bands change over time and everyone here wants them to stay the same"
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","Personally, I don't browse /r/symphonicmetal enough to know the community that well. So I can't tell you about the subreddit like that. 

Change is inevitable with an artist. Change in an artist can either happen gradually or abruptly. When you change gradually then no one is going to notice overall. Take Nightwish for example. Élan still sounds like a Nightwish song. However, compare it to any song from Angels Fall First and the style sounds similar but different. That's because the style has matured. If you change abruptly, then any artist must know doing that you will polarize your fanbase. There's no way around it, it's just inevitable. For here you can even go with Nightwish again. When Tarja was kicked out and Anette came in, the fanbase was completely split. Even to this day you will find Tarja only fans who have dropped out of listening to Nightwish. You will also find the fans who will follow Nightwish to the ends of the Earth. 

In regards to Within Temptation, if Hydra is the style they are going with from now on and not the style that was found in Mother Earth, then so be it. It's their decision. However, whether I will like it or not is to be determined. I look forward to the new album and see were things go. If I don't like where Within Temptation is going, then I won't buy their albums and I'll leave gracefully. I don't kick or whine like a child. I move on and look for other material that I enjoy. What I have stated here were my reason why I did not enjoy Hydra. I tried to the best of my abilities at 1AM to explain that. If by any means I came across as demanding that Within Temptation cater to me and me only, then I'm sorry. "
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","Their precious album is very similar to many songs on this one. It's not like this came out of nowhere."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","You're not even reading what he's trying to tell you. He's not looking for reasons for him to like this album. He's just explaining his point of view."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","I read it"
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","Unless I'm missing something, most of the reviews for Hydra were between 3.5/5 and 4/5, which I don't read as ""incredible"". Hydra wasn't*bad by any means, but it wasn't particularly good either. The lack of a unifying sound really hurt the album in my view, making it sound more like a string of would-be singles than a proper album, which is ironic because the singles from the album were some of the weakest, in my view. It was a decent record by pop metal standards, but there's nothing on the album that made me think ""that was amazing"". Within Temptation's always had a 'mainstream' type of sound which appeals more to people who wouldn't usually listen to metal, and Hydra's the album where this is most clear. The symphonic elements were pretty weak and most songs relied heavily on Sharon's vocals to drive them, (which isn't really a good thing in metal, and the gimmick of having guest vocals only works well on one track with the others either sounding out-of-place or simply boring. Overall, there are a few good tracks on the album and no tracks that stand out as bad, but there's nothing that stands out on this album so it's been mostly forgotten."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","just a personal view and nothing more but.....

Hydra was a sell out album for me. They didn't so much experiment with their sound to keep fresh as change it to a mainstream poppy sound to try and break the US and UK. totally fine direction for the band to go in if that's what they want but it just didnt do it for me.

I fell in love with mother earth and onwards, I brought the silent force tour dvd and I saw them live when they were touring the heart of everything. I was a fan.  personally though I consider hydra to be the worst purchase I made in 2014, reviews be damned."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","I've always felt that Hydra is a very weird album.

Within Temptation is one of my favorite bands and Hydra has certainly grown on me to the point where I listen to it more regularly than I did when it first came out. I think there are some great tracks on the album (Paradise, Silver Moonlight, Covered by Roses, Tell Me Why). But it also has some of my least favorite WT tracks (Dog Days, The Whole World is Watching). The rest of the tracks feel fairly ""middle of the road"" for me. Every other WT album I can listen to beginning to end without skipping a track. With Hydra, I'm more likely to skip tracks to get to the ones I like.

There are too many guest appearances - they're no strangers to having guests on their albums, but with four out of the ten songs having guest vocalists, it felt kind of overboard.

I recently got the Let Us Burn live BluRay/CD set, and, at least for the Hydra show, many of the songs worked better live, so that has certainly given me a slightly newer perspective on Hydra - for instance, I hate the album version of The Whole World is Watching, but the live acoustic version is actually quite nice.

It's not a bad album, by any stretch of the imagination, but I can't call it incredible - just weird."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","Dog Days is a terrific track. Keep listening. The Whole World Is Watching is one I passed on as well, but get the one without the guy from Soul Asylum and it's much better.

I mean that last track especially is much more poppish, but I like WT and I am not so close minded as to dislike a song because it's not a certain genre.

I would love to hear that Blu-ray, though I think the sound quality on Hydra is top notch. I wish they'd rerecord or remaster their early stuff.

Thank you for your kind(er) words than most here! :)"
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","I've listened to Dog Days many times. I don't like it.

I've heard both versions of The Whole World is Watching, and the one without Dave Pirner is certainly...better...I guess. I still don't like that song. For me, Tell Me Why is where the album ends.

The reason I don't like the song isn't because it's not a part of the genre or whatever and it's certainly not due to any sort of ""closed mindedness"". I think it's a boring song, regardless of the genre.

WT has done the whole ballad-esque thing far better when you listen to songs like All I Need or Memories or even Fire And Ice. The Whole World is Watching, to my ears, pales greatly by comparison."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. But if you don't like Dog Days then I doubt we have similar taste in music. But I will say, Within Temptation never sounded more mature and sure of themselves, with tighter songwriting and melodies, than on Hydra. If all their fans on here don't like their evolution and branching out then I'll have to just leave it behind. But the sales and reviews certainly side with me."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","For me, the only really good songs on the album are Silver Moonlight and Covered by Roses. The Unforgiving took me time to get used to but eventually I really started to appreciate and love it, but Hydra is a resounding ""meh"". I don't mind that they change their style, but I don't think they were able to pull it off properly. Several songs feel like total filler (Let Us Burn, Edge of the World, Whole World is Watching), and while I like that they explored something new with And We Run, they really lacked the creative spark. "
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","Once, Within Temptation was one of my favorite bands, but they drifted more and more into the main stream music. I miss their unique character of old times. With the last two albums they put themselves side by side with pop music artists and created rather run-of-the-mill music. All my friends who liked WT feel alike. What has made WT unique and special seems to be gone :("
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","I'd have to agree here. Pretty much everything before The Unforgiving was great to me. Excellent stuff. Had a nice range of soft and hard songs. Of the their last two albums the only song I've really listened to consistently was 'Covered By Roses' because it didn't sound like... Everything else. Black Symphony is where I see their high-point. "
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","I think it was a great album, but wasn't memorable. For me anyway. It just didn't have anything special about it to make it stand out. That being said, I still listen to it from time to time because it is enjoyable enough."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","When it came out there was definitely a lot of discussion here, but it wasn't received very positively. A lot of people loved the Paradise single but in general I feel people were disappointed with the album.

Personally I enjoy Hydra, but I would still rank it among my least favourite WT albums. I think the whole idea of the Hydra is that they would show their different ""heads"" by making different styles of song, but for me this created an end result that wasn't very cohesive. There's some individual songs on there I love, but I don't entirely love the whole. I'm not bothered by then becoming more commercial and less metal - I mean, I grew to absolutely adore The Unforgiving. I'm looking forward to what they do next and hoping it will be something that grabs me a bit more."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","Seriously... this subreddit is getting more and more full of hipsters by the day.  This album is great, but all of the comments say Hydra is too mainstream or it's not [insert previous album here].  Bands change, deal with it.  Personally, this album is well within the realm of Within Temptation's sound, and it's fantastic.  As for the rest of their albums, each one has a unique sound to me, but all different from each other.  To say this album is bad because it's a departure from their previous sound is pretty hypocritical. 


People are going to complain that it's not symphonic *metal*, but even Sharon admitted they are a symphonic *rock* band.  Stop putting labels on stuff and shunning it for labels.  You know who else did that? Hitler."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","Thank you for these comments. You worded everything better than I could."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","The songs are catchy and great for live, but it's not symphonic metal anymore. I think they deserve their ""mainstream"" success, they worked very hard for it."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","If you do a search here, I think you'll find it wasn't well reviewed. We are fans of symphonic metal. I don't think Hydra was cleanly in the SM genre. I'm sure if I listened to it for a while in the car I could find something to like, but it's not my music."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","It's this attitude that keeps me from staying around this subreddit. Way, way too elitist."
"Why isn't Hydra talked about more?","It's not elitist IMO, we just like hearing what we like. I've listed to albums and disliked them at first only to fall in love. I can also listen to stuff that isn't purely symphonic. I like a lot of WT's more recent albums. I just can't get into Hydra."

"NIGHTWISH - Making of new album 2015; Episode 10 (OFFICIAL TRAILER)","I understand that. I know he's going to be speaking. I just meant that I hope the last song has a lot more music than speaking. In other words, not another ""Song of Myself"" where half the song was talking. "
"NIGHTWISH - Making of new album 2015; Episode 10 (OFFICIAL TRAILER)","Doing the last song with half of it speaking would be to much, 12ish min? Ehm yeah. But Song of Myself, I love the speaking parts in it, never felt it was to long. And let's not mention how it starts, after all those heavy drums and chore your lead into a slow beautiful piano with a guy telling a story. It's peacefully in chaos, you breath easier and the album ends.

It's one of the brilliant pieces in the album, there is no other parts I've paid more attention to. And it have brought me a lot of thought on what they are saying, I almost have this craving to hear more! The album would never have the impact it had on me without this ending.

While I'm on it, 24 minute long song?! Fuck yeah! I love the longer songs of Nightwish, I can't avoid getting hyped. So much story cramped into one song? Ahh!

Edit: Also noticed there is a song called Edema Ruh.. damn it, more hyped."
"NIGHTWISH - Making of new album 2015; Episode 10 (OFFICIAL TRAILER)","The guy who did a bit of an AMA after the listening session said it wasn't like Song of Myself, he said Dawkins had 3 fairly short spoken parts and 2 were integrated with the music."

Proudly announcing the second guest vocalist for our upcoming album “The Human Contradiction”

Marco Hietala [Nightwish]

We are very excited about the much anticipated return of vocal force Marco Hietala on our upcoming record. After our collaboration with Marco on our first two albums we can’t help but hearing his voice in some of the songs we write! We love his contributions on The Human Contradiction: Marco adds greatly to the power of “Your Body Is A Battleground” as well as to the melancholia of “Sing To Me”.

Marco states: “I´ve done quite a few visitations on select albums during my career. Delain and their albums are among the most frequent. If you listen to their stuff, you´ll know why. Martijn and his group seem to have plenty to say both musically and lyrically. Keep it up mates!” — "

"Marco Hietala to be second guest vocalist for Delain's upcoming album ""The Human Contradiction"".","Oh, good, it seems this album is going to be heavier than the previous. 
We Are the Others was fine, but the first two were better and I hope the new one will be similar."
"Marco Hietala to be second guest vocalist for Delain's upcoming album ""The Human Contradiction"".","Feels like all the albums this year will return to some heavier roots, except for Within Temptation who's starting to feel a like like Evanescence :/"
"Marco Hietala to be second guest vocalist for Delain's upcoming album ""The Human Contradiction"".","I don't think that is entirely fair -  Hydra's biggest weakness is that it comes after The Unforgiving. That's not to say its not a weak album, just that we've been kind of spoiled. Frankly Evanescence's self titled album was stronger than Hydra and I didn't think many good thoughts about that one either. "
"Marco Hietala to be second guest vocalist for Delain's upcoming album ""The Human Contradiction"".","I'm not saying albums need to be heavy, its symphonic metal not heavy or death metal.

I meant that Evanescence was the (and some people will kill for saying this) symphonic metal band that made it to the popular music stations. The easiest way to explain to people what symp. metal is is to tell them that the Evanescence songs they know are symp. metal.

WT has the same problem,  they got really big as a group and now they wanna make songs that can actually be as popular as some of The Unforgiving has been and its turning their music into pop more than into Symphonic Metal. Its not bad music,  I just don't like buying the album of a symphonic metal band and end up listening to pop music. "
"Marco Hietala to be second guest vocalist for Delain's upcoming album ""The Human Contradiction"".","To be fair WT has always been more inclined to appeal the mainstream masses. *Mother Earth* (aside from being the cheesiest) was the album that demonstrated that with ""Ice Queen"". Ever since that release, each album that followed has subsequently been more simplistic and commercial. The comparisons with Evanescence started with THOE's ""What Have You Done"" which was compared to ""Bring Me To Life"". *Hydra* may conspicuously be the most commercial, but it's also the most complex when it comes to musicianship and mind even their heaviest (Dangerous, Silver Moonlight, Tell Me Why) since *Enter* or *The Dance*."
"Marco Hietala to be second guest vocalist for Delain's upcoming album ""The Human Contradiction"".","I didn't mean to imply that their albums needed to be heavy. Just that they weren't that good. 

I see what you're saying with regard The Unforgiving and don't entirely disagree with the point or the sentiment as I share the latter. I think though that The Unforgiving caught WT off guard a bit in terms of popularity, but then again every album they've put out has had a very distinctive feel to it - Hydra is no different in this regard but it feels like a work in progress. All this means is that any perceived loss of quality is exacerbated. 

But I stand by my statement that Evanescence self titled release was a better album than Hydra is if for no other reason than in terms of consistency. "
"Marco Hietala to be second guest vocalist for Delain's upcoming album ""The Human Contradiction"".","IMO Hydra is just continuing the trend they started with The Unforgiving... and I didn't like The Unforgiving that much. Very little symphony, and a whole lot less metal. Makes me sad that you can actually compare WT to Evanescence now. :-("
"Marco Hietala to be second guest vocalist for Delain's upcoming album ""The Human Contradiction"".","That was due to the label, I believe. They delayed the album because they wanted it to be more commercial - if you compare the single version of We Are The Others to the album version, you can see that they tried to take out the metal elements.

I remember an interview at the time where the band said that the label told them to not have Marco on the record because people would think they were dependent on him, or something along those lines. Now that Delain have changed labels to Napalm, I think they're going to go for a more metal direction once again. Since they've brought back Marco and are having growls from Alissa, this certainly seems likely!"
"Marco Hietala to be second guest vocalist for Delain's upcoming album ""The Human Contradiction"".","This is exactly what I wanted to hear :D"
"Marco Hietala to be second guest vocalist for Delain's upcoming album ""The Human Contradiction"".","Has there been any indication if there will be any other guest artists?"
"Marco Hietala to be second guest vocalist for Delain's upcoming album ""The Human Contradiction"".","Hopefully we're in for one or two more. I figure if it was just the two they'd announce Marco as the final guest vocalist."
"Marco Hietala to be second guest vocalist for Delain's upcoming album ""The Human Contradiction"".","Cool. As long as it isn't Pitbull screaming ""Mr. Worldwide!"" I'll be happy with whomever they choose lol"

"Within Temptation nominated for Best International Band in the Metal Hammer Golden Gods - Vote here","No, seriously, no. Given their last 2 albums they don't deserve this kind of attention.

These all have 2013 releases."
"Within Temptation nominated for Best International Band in the Metal Hammer Golden Gods - Vote here","Unfortunately Metal Hammer rarely pay attention to symphonic metal or much of European metal in general, really. They tend to focus on very straight-forward English and American metal most of the time, since that's what's most popular I guess.

But the quality of WT's last two albums is very much just a matter of opinion. They sold well and lots of people love them. Also I don't think there is a vote for album of the year? It's all just bands."

"In order of most liked, how would you order the Epica albums, and why?","**The Quantum Enigma:** 

To me, this album is just flawless. I don't quite understand why it's as good as it is, even after hundreds of listens. 

It's one of the few albums that increased in rating over time for me (at first, I gave it a 9-9.5/10, and it grew to be the only album I'd give a 10/10). 

It's also the only album I would consider flawless, since I pretty much always find something to criticize or nitpick about (and I suppose I could find something here), but nothing remotely significant. 

And even after hundreds of listens, I still can't really pick favorites, which has pretty much never happened to me before. I literally love every song on that album. It's really weird.

**Rating: 10/10**
___
**Requiem for the Indifferent and Design Your Universe:** 

Here I can't really pick. I love both albums equally. They're both excellent albums but also flawed, and in a way, both sides of the same coin. 

**Design Your Universe**, I think, was the album that not only made Epica really popular, but proved how good they were as a band. Lots of excellent songs, with the highlight of that album being by far Kingdom of Heaven, which still stands as one of the best songs ever written. The album, however, fell short due to its overly formulaic and repetitive structure in parts, as well as the presence of ""filler"" songs (Burn to a Cinder and White Waters are the offenders here).

**Requiem for the Indifferent**, on the other hand, is a very underrated album. I know most people tend to not like it much, but it's a very creative, experimental, progressive and heavily technical album. It shows just how talented the band members can be, despite a lot of the songs not being very melodic or memorable, and the sound mixing being disappointing (especially compared to DYU). 

It has some strong, dark themes with memorable lyrics, really beautiful songs (Avalanche, Serenade of Self-Destruction and Delirium are highlights here), as well as weird, amazing and complicated tracks (like Monopoly on Truth, Requiem for the Indifferent and Deter the Tyrant). It falls short to due a sub-par sound mix, lack of memorable melodies, existence of filler tracks, just like in DYU (the offenders here being Guilty Demeanor and Stay the Course).

**Rating: 9/10 (both)**
___
**The Divine Conspiracy:**

This album marks the turning point for Epica. I think every long-lasting great band reaches this ""turning point"", where they release an album so good that it marks a huge boost in their career, and they start being taken more seriously and get recognized alongside the bigger names. 

This album was the cornerstone that defined the modern Epica sound, and it includes some of the most amazing and memorable tracks (The Obsessive Devotion, Chasing the Dragon, Death of a Dream, Fools of Damnation and Beyond Belief). 

However, it also falls short due to flawed songwriting (the title track is a huge example of this), weird pacing and filler tracks (Never Enough is the biggest offender, Menace of Vanity and Living a Lie are particularly pointless too).

**Rating: 8.5/10**
___
**The Phantom Agony:**

This is probably one of the best debut albums ever made, and even though Mark Jansen had already made a name for himself in After Forever, The Phantom Agony stood out as a unique album in the symphonic metal space due to its classical and progressive influences, good balance of female vocals, choirs and growls, great songwriting, great ""controversial"" politics/religion-themed lyrics and a nice dark atmosphere.

It also has some really memorable tracks, including Cry for the Moon, Façade of Reality, Seif al Din and the title track.

**Rating: 7.5/10**
___

**Consign to Oblivion:**

This is definitely the weakest Epica album. A good album still, but somewhat disappointing compared to the others. 

Aside from the title track (which is great but still overrated), there are several good tracks, such as The Last Crusade, Solitary Ground, Blank Infinity, Force of the Shore, Quietus and Another Me, though most of them aren't really overly special or memorable. 

At the same time, we have a few weird tracks, such as Dance of Fate, Mother of Light and Trois Vierges, which aren't bad tracks by any means, but they feel out of place in regards to the rest of the album, and arguably compared to the rest of Epica's material. 

It also feels a bit too ""light"" and ""non-metal-y"", and the sound mix isn't great (similarly to Requiem for the Indifferent), which reduces a lot of the impact the album has. Some of these tracks sound way better live, with the current band lineup.

* The Phantom Agony

I don't have Consign to Oblivion or The Phantom Agony because they're difficult to get here in the UK, so that may factor into why I don't like them as much. Overall Epica doesn't have any *bad* albums in my opinion, but TDC and DYU stand out considerably ahead of the other four. Requiem had too many songs that sounded the same, CtO and TPA are less memorable than their later stuff, and TQE doesn't have a distinguished sound that it's three predecessors all had (it sounds like DYU part 2 to me, but with a weaker ending)."
"In order of most liked, how would you order the Epica albums, and why?","The Divine Conspiracy tops. It's dark, heavy (how I like my metal!) and touches on issues I identify with.

Then Consign to Oblivion. It has some great melodies and composition and of course the title track is just phenomenal.

This is where I get in indecisive. I'd probably say The Quantum Enigma but Design Your Universe has Kingdom of Heaven. I have to say though, aside from Kingdom of Heaven and the title track not many other songs stand out to me.  I know lots of people like Unleashed and Martyr of the Free Word but I just don't find them that interesting. So I'd say TQE third for its technical prowess and DYU fourth.

Between The Phantom Agony and Requiem for the Indifferent I'd say the former is more memorable with grander songs and themes, though Serenade of Self Destruction and Monopoly on Truth are absolutely cracking.

"In order of most liked, how would you order the Epica albums, and why?","I find Epica goes in a pattern of ""every odd numbered album is alright, yet every even numbered album is amazing"". That may be just me, but it justifies my list.

* Design Your Universe
* The Quantum Enigma
* Cosign to Oblivion
* The Divine Conspiracy
* The Phantom Agony
* Requiem For the Indifferent"
"In order of most liked, how would you order the Epica albums, and why?","When it comes to enjoying every song in the album, The Phantom Agony is at the top as I actually like every single song. 

Considering which albums are the most all-out awesome RFTI is my favorite, followed by DYU and TDC being tied. 

Consign to Oblivion was the first Epica album I got into and it has some of my favorite songs, but just not as heavy as the others. 

I am probably the one person here who lists The Quantum Enigma as my least favorite, so here are my reasons: The Essence of Silence and Victims of Contingency - great songs but the chorus repeats too much on both of them. Unchain Utopia - too many chorus repeats and a weak ending, despite nice verse and chorus melodies, repetition kills this one. Reverence - nice intro and verse but boring and overly repetitive chorus, same thing with Omen. Canvas of Life is quiet which is OK but simply not my preference. The title track, ""The Quantum Enigma"" starts out SO strong with great intro and verses, but once it hits the halfway point it basically falls apart with a weak instrumental development section, and a disappointing ending, both of which ruin the awesomeness built up in the first half of the song... this is kind of like what was starting to happen in the song ""Kingdom of Heaven"" in DYU, but they saved that song by adding an awesome bridge and the ""YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK"" part near the end which gave some contrast and made KOH a good song. The second half of the song ""The Quantum Enigma"" has to be the single biggest disappointment from Epica I have ever heard. It's like they forced a bunch of ""filler"" material to make the song 2x longer than it needed to be. Finally, TQE the album in general is not dark enough for my tastes, there is not much growling, and the choruses are too airy and boring. Still I love songs like Memento, Sense Without Sanity, Chemical Insomnia, the Second Stone, Natural Corruption, Mirage of Verity, Dreamscape, and Victims of Contingency and think the Essence of Silence is very good. Also I was dissapointed in the lack of growling in this album... "
"Leaves' Eyes - Hell To The Heavens (New Official Video)",""
"Leaves' Eyes - Hell To The Heavens (New Official Video)","Betrayers! Sorcerer! In me! The Wishmaster! Er-

Awesome song though, I'll have to start listening to Leaves' Eyes."
"Leaves' Eyes - Hell To The Heavens (New Official Video)","Haha, my immediate thought when they played this as MFVF was that it was a lot like Wishmaster."
"Leaves' Eyes - Hell To The Heavens (New Official Video)","I was really impressed by this song. It's nice to see Leaves' Eyes finally record something legitimately heavy."
"Leaves' Eyes - Hell To The Heavens (New Official Video)","This is probably going to be their best album so far. At least I think so. 

Check out the samples!

"Leaves' Eyes - Hell To The Heavens (New Official Video)","This is all I ask of symphonic metal."
"Leaves' Eyes - Hell To The Heavens (New Official Video)","Lovely song! Is it just me or is the miming unusually obvious in this video? I did watch it in full screen HD so that could be why..."
"Leaves' Eyes - Hell To The Heavens (New Official Video)","A lot of overacting."
"Edenbridge -The Bonding",""
"Edenbridge -The Bonding","All hail Lord Helix."
"Edenbridge -The Bonding","Just recently got into edenbridge and this is my favorite album so far. This song specifically is in my personal top 10 of all time.

I only just noticed how similar the lyrics are to the Bhagavad Gita, but that's most likely me seeing what I'm familiar with. I get massive frisson right before the solo break, with the lyrics ""mountains and planets and even the sun / I stay untouched / I am one"" followed by that high pitched yell. Goosebumps every single time. "

"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","I recently got into Within Temptation &amp; Epica, so I recognize them, as for everyone else...I'm kinda clueless.

Any help given to this newbie would be appreciated :-) "
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","Nobody yet?  All right, I'll give it a try.  Some of these *will be wrong*, so I'm sure the community will step in to correct me!  Left to right:

* [Floor Jansen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_Jansen) - Formerly of After Forever, now Nightwish and ReVamp.  Vocalist (*all* styles)/songwriter.
* [Mark Jansen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jansen) (no relation) - Formerly of After Forever, now Epica and MaYan.  Guitarist/songwriter/harsh vocals.

* [Russell Allen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Allen) (?) - Symphony X and about a billion other projects.  Vocalist/songwriter.  I actually don't recognize the picture, but Russell Allen absolutely has to be on here somewhere, and this one looks most like him.
* [Tarja Turunen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarja_Turunen) - Formerly of Nightwish, now does a solo act.  Vocalist/songwriter, and, apparently, pianist.
* [Tommy Karevik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Karevik) - ~~Formerly of~~ Seventh Wonder, now Kamelot.  Vocalist.

* [Manuela Kraller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuela_Kraller) - Formerly of Xandria.  Vocalist/songwriter.

Also remember that the world of symphonic metal is one big, gloriously inbred family, so you will see a lot of these artists showing up in each other's projects (cough*Ayreon*cough)."
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","I made the banner, I can confirm this list is correct :)"
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","Don't forget that Marco is also in Tarot"
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","Oh, they're still around?  I had always just thought of them as ""Marco's old band"", but Wikipedia says they're still going strong today.  Guess it's time to check them out!"
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","And Tommy is still with Seventh Wonder too."
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","Indeed.  They're supposed to have another album soon."
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","Tommy is still in Seventh Wonder, as well as being in Kamelot."
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","After Tommy, Charllote Wessels of Delain then Georg Neuhauser of Serenity"
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","Last might be Manda Ophuis of Nemesea but not sure."
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","Pretty sure it's Anette Olzon. I thought it was her but wasn't 100%, but then did an image search and she has that same arm tattoo."
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","[We have a winner!](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yTlPP9_vYs0/UbUKkqmcHiI/AAAAAAAABac/5NbOPlRBoFA/s1600/U0F5g.jpg)  I was confused over the tattoo, since there are lots of pictures of her without it.  Must be either recent or temporary.

Fun fact: I cropped/uploaded the exact image from the header, and google told me it was Floor Jansen.  
*Technology*, folks!"
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","Heheh, I made this wallpaper too! I rather liked that picture of Anette so I used it for a few different things. Unfortunately I lost the source and even reverse image search can't seem to find the original.

The tattoo is real, I believe she got it after the DPP era. There's another photo of it here: http://i.imgur.com/AMQbmU6.jpg"
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","Charlotte Wessels, really?  I specifically considered her and decided she wasn't on here; I guess I'm too accustomed to the red hair.  And I should probably listen to more Serenity."
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","She has red hair in the picture. Just hard to tell, but yeah definitely her. The background is their last album."
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","Ah thanks! I thought that might have been Tarja but wasn't sure. (I feel bad for not recognizing Floor though). I'm terrible with faces, I just know the music but thanks for the assist!

(I've been into the power-metal scene for around a decade and I wouldn't have considered Symphony X symphonic metal but that's me. Although...a lot of bands experiment, try new things, completely change their style, etc so I guess it's not like they SHOULDN'T be considered symphonic metal either....)"
"I'm new to the world of Symphonic Metal...who are the bands in the banner?","I certainly consider SymX to be symphonic (lot of keyboards, choir, strings, etc), but they could also be prog or power metal depending on your definitions.  The real reason you see Russell Allen around here is that he's one of the most prolific guest vocalists in the genre:

* [Sweet Curse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_eADl0y4s) with ReVamp/Floor Jansen
* [Victims of the Modern Age](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAMgY9_KhEU) with Star One/Floor Jansen/Damian Wilson/Dan Swanö
* [Dawn of a Million Souls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_z4LTWvpOY) with Ayreon/Damian Wilson (and guitar solo by Michael Romeo of SymX)
* [Stargazers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXuN3UiZKHI) with Avantasia/Jørn Lande/Michael Kiske/Oliver Hartmann

"Impressions of ReVamp's Wild Card?","I just saw the release yesterday through Nightwish's facebook: http://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/discography/details/3041667.71105.wild-card.html

I gave it a good listen this morning; I have to say I like it way more than the first album they put out. Tracks 6,7 and 11 are so far my favorites. Lots of emotion from Floor as she sings too &lt;3

Any thoughts from you guys?"
"Impressions of ReVamp's Wild Card?","It's heavier and more complex than their previous album. I personally think it's a great album, but it definitely needs more than one listen for someone to appreciate all that's going on. Also there's a great deal of progressive elements that I found hard to digest at first, but like I said it needs more than one listen. Floor's voice is perfect! Her grunts, screams, lyric vocals are great! She definitely out did herself. My personal favorites are:

[The Anatomy of a Nervous Breakdown: The Limbic System] (http://youtu.be/psn1Klk9emY)

[Precibus](http://youtu.be/28aRNpzKRVU)

[Distorted Lullabies](http://youtu.be/yZIg1K603LQ) 

[Wild Card](http://youtu.be/cvpV0b3TvKY)

[Sins](http://youtu.be/IWmUjLAfKuM)"
"Impressions of ReVamp's Wild Card?","Heavier and more complex just about sums it up for me as well. I think that's why I like it more. I can also see this being an acquired taste for some folks, but they had me at the first note. The opening track is fantastic. 

I actually hadn't heard Sins yet, the version I got doesn't have the bonus track :( Thanks for posting it!

I'm glad that Floor came back from her illness kicking ass, as evidenced by the Nightwish tour, and now this. &lt;3"
"Impressions of ReVamp's Wild Card?","I agree with you that it's a better album than the first one. *Distorted Lullabies* is my favorite track.

But now I'm really torn because I want Floor to be Nightwish's lead, but if that happens then Revamp might have to disband..."
"Impressions of ReVamp's Wild Card?","Not necessarily, it's possible to do both as long as both bands are mindful of each other. :)"
"Impressions of ReVamp's Wild Card?","Marco still plays in tarot and empuu has a side project with his brother. Toumas has a solo album coming up too. Nightwish is big enough now that they don't have to do an album every two years (and likely won't) Personally i'd like to see Nightwish go with guest vocals on the albums and then just pick up a touring vocalist for the tour form here on out. "

"Sirenia - Darkling",""
"Sirenia - Darkling","If you know them, it makes me sad that they are on this subreddit. They started out as such good gothic metal. Then, gradually, starting a little bit in Nine Destinies and a Downfall, they started going more symphonic, then more so in The 13th Floor, then all the way in The Enigma of Life, and still in Perils of the Deep Blue. I still love them, but it makes me sad that Morten left the strong (and very well done) gothic feel of his music. Oh well. This is a great song."
"Sirenia - Darkling","I actually thought this album was a return to more of a gothic style. But honestly, I really enjoy both gothic and symphonic metal, so I love albums like this one and, say, An Elixir for Existence, for different reasons."
"Sirenia - Darkling","I love both as well, and I wouldn't care at all except for the sorta sad lack of great Gothic metal still being written. He was doing so awesomely with At Sixes and Sevens and An Elixir for Existence that I just wish he would have made more."
"Sirenia - Darkling","Yeah, it would be cool if he could do another side project that was more along those lines so we could have both!"
"Sirenia - Darkling","Check out Mortemia. Its his third band, he just has one album. But its pretty good, I hope he goes back to it. And maybe brings a girl on board. But then it might as well be Sirenia again, so I don't know"
"Sirenia - Darkling","I feel the same way. I actually liked Nine Destinies and a Downfall the most, but 13th Floor was lacking something, it wasn't bad, but by The Enigma of Life, it was just more of the same, every song just sounded the same, had the same structure, similar lyrics... I just realized I was subconsciously avoiding listening to Perils of the Deep Blue, so that I wasn't disappointed again."
"Sirenia - Darkling","At Sixes and Sevens remains my favorite, but Nine Destinies and a Downfall had some really good ones too, The Call and Glades of Summer come to mind. I think The 13th Floor had a similar issue to what happened on Dark Passion Play by Nightwish; a new singer. And while Sirenia had a different one every time until Ailyn stayed on, for some reason it kinda feels like that similar sort of disconnect that happened with Nightwish. I think it came from Ailyn's style; she's a symphonic/power singer, a la her guest appearance in The Chevalier by Serenity (awesome song). So yeah, that's how I feel about it."
"Sirenia - Darkling","My favourite is One By One; that instrumental part before the last refrain is pure eargasm. And I actually really liked Dark Passion Play, the band just felt freed and unleashed for me, I didn't feel any disconnect. For me, the reason I didn't like 13th Floor is because it felt repetitive, and sort of dumbed down and tuned down, if that makes sense. And that repetitiveness was just dialed up to eleven in The Enigma of Life, just every damn song the same damn thing. Ailyn's style is pretty good, so I actually think it's the unwillingness of Morten to try something new, at least that's how it seems to me. Even the Mortemia album is just Sirenia without a female singer, the songs sound the same, the structure is the same. It's a damn shame, the man was a genius. I think he needs a real band, with other people contributing and evolving the musical style forward, not just doing everything by himself.

Great song btw, haven't heard it before."
"Sirenia - Darkling","That's a really good point about him having a full band there with him. I didn't really think about that before. And I guess for me with Annette in DPP I just felt like she stuck out like a sore thumb, like they hadn't fit her in just right yet. I love the Lacrimas Profundere type of sound and feel, and old Sirenia had that in a way that new Sirenia doesn't. It's not that it's bad, it great, but I don't close my eyes and end up in foggy forests and breezy castle corridors at night with the new stuff :)"
"Sirenia - Darkling","I'd definitely recommend giving the new album ago. I felt the same way about The Enigma of Life, it was very samey. Though PotDB is more of the same style, Ailyn's singing has vastly improved and she does some interesting things with her voice, and in general it just seems like Morten made an effort to mix things up a bit."
"Sirenia - Darkling","Yeah, I will definitely give it a go. I listened to the song you posted, and while it was better than anything I heard on TEoL, it still sounds pretty generic, so I'm not getting my hopes up. Maybe I will get a nice surprise."

Hello everyone!
Probably to a big surprise for everyone in here, we are announcing Dianne van Giersbergen to be our new lead singer! Dianne, 28 years old and from the Netherlands, might be known to many from her Dutch band Ex Libris.

At the same time, Dianne’s arrival means the departure of Manuela Kraller, who regrettably decided to continue a different musical path. Certainly, that was a big shock to all of us hearing Manu say she wanted to try other things. With major regrets we had to let her go. Not an easy task to deal with, whilst the goal was untouchable: To continue the musical journey we had taken with “Neverworld’s End”. But: We are very happy to have found THE new voice and face in Xandria who will continue this fantastic ride, our last album “Neverworld’s End” had taken us to. And we are yet to sail way, way further with Dianne now!

Manuela thanks all fans and us in a personal statement:
“After three years with the boys in Xandria, I decided to follow a different path and go my own musical way. ” Manuela leaves with regret but also full of gratitude, thanking XANDRIA and fans for the time together and being grateful for the “wonderful moments in mutual tours and shows”. She is “wishing Dianne and band all the very best for the future!”.

Last weekend’s shows in Leipzig, Germany and in Pratteln (Switzerland) at the “Masters of Symphonic Metal” Festival have been the last concerts for Manuela performing together with XANDRIA.
We will certainly miss Manuela! We are also thankful for the magical time we shared and wish her all the best for the future!

BUT: The show must go on and it sure will! We promise, what began with “Neverworld’s End” was just a start and is yet to be taken to a higher level! Dianne will debut on stage with Xandria during our Spain tour in November.

We hope you all will be with us! The Dream is still alive!"

By the way, I noticed that in the trailer Mark Jansen is listed with both Epica and MaYaN, but Floor is listed only with Nightwish and not ReVamp after her name. It's also kinda weird that Anneke van Giersbergen's old band is listed (The Gathering) while the former projects of other musicians aren't. I'm probably reading too much into all this though."

"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","I'm just hoping the Earbook version doesn't take weeks to ship to me after the release date..."
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","That's been happening to me a lot. I didn't get the Hydra book until over a month after it's release, even though I preordered it. I also pre-ordered the book edition of Lacuna Coil's Broken Crown Halo a week in advance and I got an email a few weeks after release saying it was sold out and no longer available. I know Lacuna Coil is Century Media but they have some relation with Nuclear Blast. Hope they get their shit together for this."
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","I prefer to wait for the CD, I just find that it's then a lot more exciting when I get the album in the post. I'm pretty sad that it leaked, really - I mean, most people have hopefully pre-ordered it already so I doubt it will make a huge difference. But the more this happens, the more labels will stop sending albums out to reviewers and probably stop posting things before release day. And I'm sure the band will be disappointed."
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","I don't really think leaks are uniformly bad. I suspect there are not many people who would not buy the album only if it leaked early. It'll be online one way or the other. [This paper](http://www.scribd.com/doc/93891327/Hammond-File-Sharing-Leak) tries to empirically measure what a leak means in terms of album sales.

That said I'm the same as you. I'd much rather wait for the album. I've looked at the track previews and the singles released, but I trust the band and label to decide what the best first experience with the album should be. "
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","Before this album, I would go back and forth between whether my favorite Epica album is Design Your Universe or the The Phantom Agony. Now I think I'll be stuck between three albums. There is so much that I like about The Quantum Enigma, but a couple of things that hold it back from being the clear winner.


Pros:

* I absolutely love the concept for the sound of the album. It has some of the heaviest use of orchestration in a while, very catchy choruses and hooks, and solid guitar riffs. It's almost as moody as The Phantom Agony while being as heavy as Design Your Universe. The sound is richer and fuller than ever.
* Quality lyrics once again. Philosophical, spiritual, and just down-right brilliant ideas. I'm glad they didn't stray too far into quantum physics and kept things relatable to the human experience. 
* The opener and the interlude are perfect!
* Lots of stand out tracks. The Second Stone, The Essence of Silence, and Sense without Sanity are my favorites, but there are so many good ones that I could see my favorites list changing after each listen.
* Virtually every song has a big moment where it takes you by surprise and raises the track to a new level.
* Simone's vocals are her best. Some operatic leanings, but smooth at the same time. She conveys so many emotions, it's just wonderful.


Cons:

* Not enough variation in song length. I'm glad they didn't bloat songs needlessly just for the sake of length, but I wish we had gotten more of the structural complexity that only a long track can provide.
* ~~TQE is missing a strong ballad track (like Delirium, Solid Ground, or Tides of Time). While the interlude helps, the album feels less varied than previous releases. However, this might be a positive depending on your taste.~~ 
* The title track was a little underwhelming. It's a great song, but not quite as good as some of the other lengthy tracks Epica has done. Maybe I'm a little more critical of this point since Sense without Sanity is the only other track over 7 minutes in length.

Edit: Canvas of Life is an amazing ballad track."
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","&gt; TQE is missing a strong ballad track (like Delirium, Solid Ground, or Tides of Time)

To me, Canvas of Life is a ballad and a pretty good one.   

&gt;The title track was a little underwhelming. It's a great song, but not quite as good as some of the other lengthy tracks Epica has done.    

~~I agree with you on that. Maybe it's because I've only listened to it a few times, but it doesn't really stand out to me. That was the song I had the biggest hopes for. Maybe it will get better after a few listens.~~  
After listening to the whole album a million times already, I really love this track. I didn't really appreciate it at first, but it's a beautiful song with an epic orchestral composition."
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","Holy crap! How did I forget about Canvas of Life?! I fully retract that statement."
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","Listening to it now, and I have to say, I was hooked on Victim of Contingency. Really liking the sound. Very heavy."
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","Damn... DYU and RFTI were already excellent albums, but this might be their first true masterpiece. I still need to listen to it more and ""digest"" the various songs, but it's an extremely impressive album so far, with amazing songwriting, production, mixing and performances and overall good lyrics. Hopefully we'll get the 320 kbps version soon, along with the bonus tracks, which so far sound pretty great. Assuming Opeth's Pale Communion doesn't impress me even more, this is definitely my album of the year, and my favorite Epica album too."
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","Totally hooked by The Second Stone at the moment. Whoa :D

FYI it has leaked (in good quality, 95% complete), so *everyone* should be listening right now ;-)"
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","I'm the same way. I've been singing it to myself all day at work. I've only listened to the first 5 songs. I can't wait to go home and finish listening to the rest. "
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","Sounds promising. Their last few albums have been incredibly boring and ""safe"" so to speak, so hopefully I'll like this one."
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","Thanks for the tip, I had no idea! Gotta study for my last exam that's tomorrow morning but now I know what I'm going to do all afternoon :)"

"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","Last song is corrupted I've heard? I haven't reached that point yet though"
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","It seems like it ends abruptly (~10 seconds early), but other than that it's all good."
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","I wish I could find the stupid leak, the couple of supposed downloads I found turned out to be fake."
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","[deleted]"
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","This album is fantastic. After being mildly disappointed by Within Temptation's Hydra and surprised by Delain's album, Epica managed to top just about everything I've heard in this genre (for me at least).

I previously would have said that Within Temptation was my favorite symphonic metal group but I think that Epica may be the new reigning band for me now. I didn't think they'd top Design Your Universe but damn did they ever. "
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","It's different, and at the same time, I am in complete awe. Design Your Universe has been my favourite album from them, and I would listen to it at least once a day since release for about a year since release. It has been the album I've recommended to many people to introduce them to Epica. I feel that has changed, and for the better.

The ones that stick out to me the most is Natural Corruption, Chemical Insomnia (with The Fifth Guardian interlude), and The Second Stone. They're catchy, sophisticated, and not lacking in any way as I had anticipated after Requiem for the Indifference.

I thought they couldn't top DYU, but for me, the album is a perfect 10/10. Some songs weren't what I expected them to be, but I am pleasantly surprised they weren't. That's just from listening to the samples over and over again. When it releases here on Tuesday, I'm definitely going to go buy it from my local music store."
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","Easily one of my favorites. Just like with DYU and RFTI, it's one of those albums where it takes three or four listens to fully sink in, but with each listen it just becomes more and more wonderful.

Simone sounds great, the guitars are strong, I love the amount of choirs and orchestra. I'm just waiting to get my actual order in the mail this week so I can listen to bonus tracks like Dreamscape and whatnot. "
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","Dreamscape is fucking amazing! Both the regular and acoustic versions are phenomenal. "
"For those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?","Absolutely brilliant.. There's nothing wrong with this album, but.. I prefer the new Ancient Bards album. That one has lots more oddities which don't make sense, like the fact that a chorus which is (according to the story) supposed to be sung by a daughter, but it is sung by a male vocalist (!). However, that album has lots more really fun tracks that stand out.

To me the Quantum Enigma is great, in some senses it lacks ambition. 

If you look at the new ancient bards album and compare it to TQE, the first thing you notice is that the Ancient Bards album has 3 tracks fewer, but has longer tracks (a 12+ minute track and a 16+ minute track). However, it does require of the listener to accept a bad English accent, mostly on the first track.
Short comparison: epica has better lyrics, ancient bards better general writing."

"I feel Epica's song, ""Martyr of the Free Word"", is more relevant now than ever because of the shooting that happened at Charlie Hebdo.","Agreed... Plus it's just a really cool song. :)

On another note, I wonder if Epica is on the Islamic extremists' hit list... they have a lot of songs that are critical of Islam... Most of TPA and some in TDC. Muslims have been posting comments on ""Fools of Damnation"" on YouTube saying that it's wrong to include the recordings of the tower-singing guy on the song, and that they think the song in general is not appropriate due to its subject matter. "
"I feel Epica's song, ""Martyr of the Free Word"", is more relevant now than ever because of the shooting that happened at Charlie Hebdo.","They are critical of the idea of religion alltogether though, and not just Islam."
"I feel Epica's song, ""Martyr of the Free Word"", is more relevant now than ever because of the shooting that happened at Charlie Hebdo.","I'd agree they're mildly critical of religion in general, but the only song criticizing another specific religion that I can think of is ""Living a Lie"" (about Christianity). Even though Cry for the Moon criticized the Catholic church, it's exposing the corruption of the institution rather than the religion itself (inherently the religion is used to justify the institution) but the point is that Mark Jansen's lyrics, from the first two After Forever albums, almost the entirety of TPA and a couple times in TDC, all the way up to MaYaN's first album Quarterpast, Islam itself, the religion and the institution, has been criticized several times, going so far as to quote Muslim words/phrases. It's clear that Mark and probably the rest of the band have a lot more of a beef with Islam than they do with any other specific religion, just because in general it is more corrupt - as the song ""Seif al Din"" states: 

&gt;The rudiments have always been misinterpreted during history,
despite the good intentions of many disciples who's faithful believe was strong and unswayed.
Most leaders interpret the old words to their
advantage in the attempt of gaining leadership and power
over those unfortunate enough to fall under their maliciousness and manipulative ways.
This misuse of trust will forever stain the pages of history,
echoing the exploitation and the frailty of decent
men carried away by nurtured rancour..."

I like Annete's albums way more than I like Tarja's, but it seems like only 1% of nightwish fans feel the same way."
"Nightwish - The Pharaoh Sails to Orion","it has little to do with annette versus tarja. I felt like the first albums had more personnality and uniqueness than the last ones. Keep in mind i grew with them. I bought angels fall first before oceanborn was released. Got a lot of stuff from them. Hell I even have the The Carpenter single... all that drama within the band struck me as childish at the time, and their music kind of started to sound the same. It's still good, just feels a bit washed down."
"Nightwish - The Pharaoh Sails to Orion","I feel the exact opposite, although I also grew with the Tarja albums, to me, they now feel childish, simple, and almost incomplete, completely different from the Annete ones, which, for me, feel way fuller, more like complete works of art rather then just another normal song.

I like the ""Tarja era's"" songs because I simply like the sound of them, but I LOVE the ""Annete era's"" songs because not only do I love the sound of them, but I also feel all the emotion from the song, and to me that is beautiful, (this isn't just because of the singer obviously, I feel like even the instrumentals pass way more feelings than previous ones).

Have you watched the Imaginaerum movie? For me, the Imaginaerum album and movie together create the greatest piece of art that mankind has ever created, I don't even know how to describe the way I felt after watching that movie."

"MFVF Questions","Has anyone here attended? As an American, I always worry about going to something like this because of language barriers, and I have no one to go with. What can you tell us about your experiences with MFVF and other international concerts?"
"MFVF Questions","Hi! I'm English and I went to the festival last year. I didn't find the language barrier to be too much of a problem, at my hotel and the festival most people spoke at least a little English if not more. 

In general I thought the festival was awesome, especially since it's a lot cheaper than UK ones. It's in one big hall with merch stalls and a bar at the back and various food vans outside - they have a barbecue, pasta, pizza, fries etc. They don't mind you bringing food and drink inside which is a big plus. If you shell out for a VIP ticket you can go to the VIP bar behind the stage where you can meet lots of the bands - almost everyone except the headliners walked through at some point while I was there. This also could be good if you go on your own because lots of people sit back there and chat. If you can't get VIP, you can also go to the signing table - again, almost all of the bands were there signing at some point in the weekend.

I'm not a big expert on the fest because I've only been once, but I'm happy to answer any more questions that you have. :)"
"MFVF Questions","How much would you say it cost for the whole event?"
"MFVF Questions","Hmm, I'm struggling to remember... I think it was about £100 each for VIP tickets (apparently the VIP tickets have changed price but the normal ones are the same, about £70/$115) and a couple of hundred for the hotel."

"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!",""
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","This is brilliant - so interesting and the data is well-presented and easy to read (I just read it all on mobile with no problems).

I think the demographic of the sub is the biggest surprise for me. I would have thought there would be more women (especially given the amount of times people have made comments to me about symphonic metal being 'girly'), and more people from Europe (where the genre is most popular). But if you'd asked me about the demographic of Reddit as a whole I probably would have guessed that there's a lot of male Americans, so perhaps it's not so surprising after all. 

It was interesting as well to see that the answers I picked were invariably the most popular ones. I'm obviously just too mainstream... "
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","This was a lot of work, but definitely worth doing. Please post if you have any questions or suggestions!"
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","I thought it was interesting that despite only being a part of Nightwish so far for live shows, and the album yet to be released, Floor is nearly as popular as Tarja already."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","Yeah, unless the upcoming studio album with Floor is terrible I expect her to be the favourite Nightwish vocalist within the year. I also found it very interesting that Anette is ranked below Marco."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","The results are pretty much in line with what I expected, although with even fewer Europeans and way more Nightwish fans than I had thought. It kinda saddens me as a big Therion fan to see them so far down these lists (and I was apparently the only person who said Sirius B was their favourite album). On the other hand, it's nice to see symphonic black metal finally getting some love. Also, someone put E Nomine as their favourite symphonic metal band, which is something I never would have expected."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","Yeah, Therion is really underappreciated on this sub. I like how it got only 11 people voting and yet 6 different picks overall in the favourite album category. I also agree with you that Sirius B is consistently overlooked by people, in fact even by most Therion fans - ok, perhaps it's not *as good as* Secret of the Runes, but in my opinion it still belongs to the top three (together with Theli). 

Where do you see the love for symphonic black though? I lost all my hope after reading that I was seemingly the only one to vote for Vortex as their favourite vocalist. I get it that most people prefer female singers, but... losing to Anette Olzon? That hurts. Maybe next year there should be separate categories for female and male vocalists.  "
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","Choosing the best Therion album to list as my favourite was really difficult because they've released so many top notch albums over the years. I think part of the reason they're not very popular here is because their best albums are all old - older than Reddit. Plus, they don't have the same ""epic metal"" feel that attracts a lot of people to symphonic metal in the first place, especially to Epica, Blind Guardian and Nightwish.

What I meant about the symphonic black metal scene getting some love is that it's the first time I've seen a black metal band be mentioned here, as the scene usually gets ignored. There were a few mentions of Dimmu Borgir and Abrahadabra in the survey responses, so there are at least a few fans of the genre on here."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","what are some good songs from ""E Nomine?"""
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","It depends what you're looking for (it's worth noting that they were an electronic group, not metal). The extended version of [Schwarze Sonne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxTimWOT5bA) is one of my favourite songs by any band. Mitternacht, Vater Unser, Die Runen von Asgard and Der Furst Der Finsternis are good examples of their more upbeat style, while Psalm 23, Die Sintflut, Das Rad Des Schicksals are calmer and more emotional. Angst, Zorn, Der Ring Des Niebelungen and Ave Maria are all worth listening to as well."

"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","What is the must have Therion album? I've been meaning to listen to them for ages but never got to it. I'll check em out. "
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","Their most important album stylistically is *Theli*, from all the way back in 1996. *Theli* is arguably the first truly symphonic metal album. It contains Therion's amazing signature song *To Mega Therion*.

Their best album is either *Secret of the Runes* or *Sirius B*. 

Their best live album is *Live Gothic*, the video of which is really worth watching. "
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","Theli marks the beginning of Therion's distinct style of symphonic metal and is definitely worth listening to. Lemuria/Sirius B and Secret of the Runes are also fan favourites, and all three are worth listening to. Secret of the Runes was the first Therion album I listened to, so I'd start there or with Theli."

"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","If I could have listed two songs it would have made my list, but I was only allowed one."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","I wonder if the popularity of Tarja was because many of us discovered Nightwish with Tarja as the lead vocalist and grew attached to her voice?

That was certainly the case with me, I never did care for Anette's style (not as operatic), though I don't mind the songs with her singing, I just prefer Tarja.  Certainly looking forward to seeing how Floor Jansen will be."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","i liked nightwish and got into them because they were something new and their songs were interesting, tbh i did NOT prefer tarja's vocals"
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","That's how I feel as well. Though for me, Tarja was the better fit than Anette but IMO she wasn't very good. Even with studio work, it still seemed like Tarja struggled to keep it on key sometimes (I could never listen to Tarja sing live, it was just bad), and it never sounded like she sang with much energy.

Floor is very energetic and does very well live, which is a great sign for when they go into the studio IMO.

I guess what I'm saying is that Floor is my favorite because she has the right sound like Tarja, but can back it up with energy and proficiency."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","I totally agree. Tara was certainly unique and it helped make Nightwish stand out, but honestly she wasn't that good. If it wasn't for Toumas' music backing her, I doubt anyone would know who she is. Compare her to really good operatic vocalists like Sarah Brightnan and she is just not in that class. And watching her on stage was cringe worthy. She danced around like an old woman. :p Her showmanship was also bad.

I'm not trying to shit on Tarja, i just don't really care for her. And yes she was certainly a better fit than Anette who was even worse live. I still liked Anette on the albums though.

But thank god for Floor. They finally have the vocalist they deserve. Already have my VIp tickets for May. :)"
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","I love to see these comments! 

Personally, I liked Annette a bit more than Tarja, mainly because she fit the direction Nightwish was headed in much better. The early albums with Tarja sounded great, but by the time we got around to Once, her voice just sounded wooden. Regardless of what her supporters brag, I doubt any of them would claim that Tarja can pull off a song like Meadows of Heaven. 

I feel like the best vocalists are either excellent at one style of vocal or else they can cover lots of territory. Tarja was a mediocre opera vocalist who stood out in a time when there weren't many opera vocalists in symphonic metal. Nowadays, you can listen to a band like Liv Moon and Tarja seems laughable in comparison. But Floor, on the other hand, can cover a wide range of styles, so even if she isn't a world class opera singer, she still is pretty much ideally suited for the genre. "
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","100% agreed. Tarja was good enough for her time, but she can't cut the mustard today. Even Xandria's new singer wipes the floor with her, especially live. Saw them live and my jaw dropped at how amazing the entire band was live after they opened with Nigthfall.

"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","Just a thought, in the future you should require people to answer every question so that you don't add even more selection bias than is already there. :)"
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","I don't like this idea. You'd have to be asking perfect questions."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","No, the thought is that small errors will be smoothed out as your sample size gets larger. "
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","If you have to answer every question that would create a stronger correlation between each question.

If you don't have to answer every question it would simply be a collection of one question surveys. There would be no actual 'error'. You just can't create as strong a correlation between each question. However, as the sample size increases the correlation strength increases.

Unless you have perfectly worded questions, creating a requirement to answer every question would then present an actual error. For example, when I was taking this survey and I was asked ""Where are you from?"" I am conflicted because I live in america, but I wasn't born in america. I also have dual citizenship. I simply did not answer that question. I could have put down america, but that wouldn't be entirely true which creates a little bit of actual error because x% of the answers to the questions won't be entirely true. "
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","The thing is, if 95% of people know where they come from there's minimal error in the survey. The problem I'm pointing out is that if you allow people to skip questions you have selection bias. What it people from America really like to tell people that they're from America, but people from Sweden are very private and don't like to share? then you ahve a significant bias in your survey, which is more problematic than the small % of people that don't know the answer to the question. 

Further, even just putting an 'I don't know' option would probably lessen the bias a little bit (while requiring people to answer)."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","Yes, but because you treat each question as a separate survey that bias doesn't matter. 

Assume all people from Sweden are shy and don't answer the question ""where are you from"". If I take a one question survey of /r/symphonicmetal and ask them where they're from i'm not gonna get anyone telling me they're from Sweden. I could repeat this and the same results would appear.

Furthermore If I didn't want to tell you where I was from, or I didn't have a correct option. I might just not take the survey all together. I often do that with surveys that ask me ""where are you from"" or questions that ask if i'm ""black/african american"" without having an option for ""other"" because they're just too ambiguous. People don't like it when you represent everyone else, but not represent them so they just won't take your survey. People want to feel in control when they're taking surveys they don't have to be.

If you choose to require every answer filled you have to carefully word your questions so that you're able to represent as many people as possible. Having an ""other"" option is a bit ambiguous. If you want to make a quick survey, like this one, whose participants don't number in the thousands it shouldn't require every answer filled."

"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","Very interesting survey. I'm one of the six older than 46 who voted. I like so much music it gets hard to keep track of everything. I'm still discovering older bands let alone new ones to listen to. I like music from Jazz to classical to disco to metal. Seems I choose a lot of the popular answers which is fine, I don't mind being mainstream. haha."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","I said that I count Evanescence as symphonic metal and I'm really surprised most people disagree. That said, I only have The Open Door and Fallen. Fallen especially had the occasional strings and choir but I haven't heard much of their later stuff.

Kingdom of Heaven needs more love! I reckon if it wasn't competing with Ghost Love Score and The Poet and the Pendulum it would have scored higher. All those songs are almost certainly in a top 5 for me. 

The results are pretty much what I expected, though I assumed there was a massive majority of Europeans but apparently not. 

Great survey! Good job and thanks for doing all the hard work! :D

"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","At least I wasn't the only guy from Portugal to use the survey hehe. Im happy for Floor Jansen being #1. I dont listen to Nightwish nor Epica though. I voted for Therion - Secret of The Runes for best album.

"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","Thanks for doing this, man. Great survey and fun to see the results."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","I think the biggest surprise (for me) is the love people have for Nightwish's Ghost Love Score. I didn't think it was that popular, for I find it to be a farely boring tune. But again, that's personal opinion.

Excellent data collected nonetheless."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","I expect that's down to [Floor's Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V_eoR6r1Tw) of it. Definitely my favourite version of any song ever."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","I was unaware that she sang it. Granted, live stuff usually flies under the radar for me unless it's something special, much like Epica's Classical Conspiracy album."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","Floor live is always something special. "
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","It's a perennial favourite. I've done my own polls where I've pre-emptively removed it from the list because it always wins! I've always liked it but, as others have said, it was Floor's version of it that boosted it to being my top song."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","Seeing all the love for Floor I expected After forever to be higher up there. Maybe if they were still around."
"Results of the /r/symphonicmetal survey!","Yeah me too. Even apart from launching Floor's career in metal, After Forever also gave birth to Epica (by firing Mark Jansen but also enabling him to meet Simone Simons) and several other band members have gone on to do so much more in symphonic metal. After Forever played a significant part in the history of the genre! "

Seriously though, I love the artwork and I'm cautiously excited about this. Their 3 albums after An Elixir For Existence were all a combination of bad or average, but Perils of the Deep Blue was a massive improvement and a return to roots. 

Heavier, bolder, stronger melodies with much better songwriting, vocals, a lot of which easily compete with their first 2 albums and even surpass them in some instances (like their masterpiece, ""Stille Kom Døden"", which is, IMO, the best song they've made to this day)."

"Arch Enemy - Time Is Black","Yeah indeed, I do think it's ok. But I'm considering whether we should have a ""similar genre"" tag or something like that. I ended up doing that in my DeviantArt group because so many people wanted to submit stuff about other metal bands or female singers in general."

http://youtu.be/-QYlycb1gIY?t=2m48s

The first time I heard this riff on this video I was so pumped to hear this song and now it seems to be not on the album at all. I've even listened to a bunch of bonus songs and I just can't find it. Does anyone know what is up? Is this going to be in some upcoming song or something? Or did this not make the album? If so that is incredibly disappointing. 

Please tell me I've just missed it completely."
"Why is this song not on the new Epica album? Riff from the studio documentary. Please help!!","Pretty sure that's Memento, which is the vinyl-exclusive bonus track, the only one we're missing.

"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums In 2015","Other than [Haggard's album Grimm](http://www.reddit.com/r/symphonicmetal/comments/2r3c86/haggard_grimm_will_be_out_in_2015/) I can't give you any concrete information, but these three bands are worth keeping an eye out for:

&amp;nbsp;

Diablo Swing Orchestra released a single in late 2014 and will presumably complete their new album in 2015. I haven't been able to find anything definitive. (Also, I'd call them ""experimental metal with symphonic elements"" or something like that. Not really symphonic metal, and it's a damn shame their amazing soprano left.)

&amp;nbsp;

Eihwaz is still looking for funding for their new album. It was originally planned for late 2014... Their song *[Amadeus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXkdHRNnb6g)* is incredible, and the rest of their debut was good too. I really hope they'll find enough funds to produce a second album.

&amp;nbsp;

Therion has been making vague promises about an upcoming ""rock opera"" for several years now. Some songs have been played at live shows, and last year a tentative date of late 2014 was given. So maybe 2015 will be the year. I really liked their last, the *[Fleurs des Mal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFD7YIk_9dw)* cover album, as insane as the idea sounded."
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums In 2015","Thanks for the suggestions! I'll add them in. There seems to be a lot of albums that are supposed to come out but don't have any official date. I've just seen Tarja's record label saying she would release something as well."
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums In 2015","Good to see Haggard's elusive Grimm is finally nearing release. Hopefully they have less of the cookie monster vocals in this album in comparison to their previous work.

Also, if I remember correctly, the (very) recently released limited print DVD has some of the new material on it, so a 2015 release sounds likely. I didn't particularly dislike Les Fleurs du Mal, but I feel like it's a step back from their previous albums (excluding Sitra Ahra). Perhaps 2015 will finally be the year Therion returns to it's best, but for now I'm remaining skeptical."
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums In 2015","To clarify: The Rock Opera based on A Short Tale Of The Antichrist is not vague, he is pretty much finished writing but needs an investor to make it happen."
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums In 2015","Arcturus - Unknown Title - Currently recording, likely 2015

Haggard - *Grimm* - 2015 date confirmed

Kull [Former Bal-Sagoth] - Unknown Title - 2015 - Delayed
"
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums In 2015","I wouldn't put too much faith in the new haggard album being released this year. In the past they've said when their albums would be released and they were almost always delayed. I sure hope it does get released this year though, I want to hear some new haggard!"

"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","OK first off, I actually really liked Within Temptation's last album, *The Unforgiving*, it was a good rock album, it wasn't metal, but it had a feeling, a beat, I could drive to it, the songs had **had a hook**.

Hydra has none of that. The album is just crap. Not a single song on there even has a hook! There are maybe 2 total bars of music across the entire album that sound like they could turn into something good, right before the song comes crashing down to mediocrity.

Am I alone in not feeling this album? Is there something I am not just getting here?

The album was apparently well reviewed, but, what the hell. Not a single hook. I don't feel it at all, and I can damn nearly listen to /anything/ and find something good about it. Even if it is in a genre that I despise, I can typically tell if a song is good. After a dozen+ listens trying to find something good in it, Hydra just sounds... boring."
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","I quite enjoy *Hydra*. It's not my favourite WT album (it might even be my least favourite) but I don't hate it, by any means. The absolute best song on there is *Paradise* for me - probably helped by the fact that it has my favourite music video ever. I really like *Silver Moonlight*, *Covered by Roses* and *Tell Me Why*. The other songs are all just OK for me. 

I prefer the version of *Whole World Is Watching* with Piotr Rogucki, because he sounds a lot more enthusiastic to me, and doesn't do that strange laugh at the beginning. But I really dislike how that song ends so abruptly - that's something that puts me off listening to the album all the way through.

This album is missing something special, but I couldn't tell you what it is. Maybe it is the hooks. And hey, I have friends who love this album, and friends who wouldn't have listened to symphonic metal without it. But I do hope I'll enjoy the next WT record a lot more."
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","I liked Hydra. Personally, I'm impressed that they have the guts to try something *different* - it's not easy to do when you're expected to only produce one kind of song. 

Sharon mentioned that they'd done everything they could with their usual style with *The Heart of Everything*, so it's understandable that they're looking for new avenues. *The Unforgiving*, for example, focused on storytelling with music, which makes it my favorite WT album. *Hydra* focuses on diverse genres and styles, which the name itself alludes to.

It's not for everyone, but to say that it's boring or crap is... a bit strong, I think. I liked *Covered by Roses* and *Tell Me Why*, not to mention the opening three tracks. It's a very solid album overall, it just lacks the high points that *The Quantum Enigma* has, for example.

I'd be disappointed if they'd continued churning out the same thing over and over again. So kudos to them for being innovative. 
"
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","I think [Paradise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy6MpsDPKts) is a great song, and I like [Silver Moonlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAQx4VPwwGs) too. Other than that Hydra didn't impress me either."
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","I'll confess, I had forgotten about Paradise 

But then a song like *And We Run* comes up and is just garbage. :(

It is sad because so many of the songs are *close* to being good, but then they just fall short.

On the plus side, the music videos are actually pretty good. Heh. They actually got budget. 


"
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","I have to admit that I actually love And We Run. I have no idea why. On paper it's terrible, symphonic metal mixed with rap and Xzibit?!  But it's just a catchy song. "
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","Do people really dislike And We Run and Dangerous? I personally loved the diversity of the artists they invited to do guest vocals. Howard is generally well-received in whatever he does, and regardless of what people want to say, Xzibit is not a platinum-selling rapper for no reason.

They obviously don't measure up to Paradise, but come on, Tarja can't be beaten when it comes to symphonic, and the fact that Paradise was so good doesn't make the other songs bad."
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","I generally don't like rap music at all, but I loved And We Run. Yes, it's definitely different and not like any other symphonic metal I know, or even like normal WT for that matter, but I enjoyed it."
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","I love the album, but Whole World is Watching is the worst WT ever. "
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","I like it.  It's not my favorite but I like all the songs on Hydra.  I got to see them live in September and I really enjoyed seeing them play the Hydra songs.  "
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","I give the album 3 out of 5 stars. I don't hate it, but I wish it were better. They really branched out and experimented and I can appreciate that. I just hope they're using this album as a jumping-off point for a really stellar next album.

1. **""Let Us Burn""**: Not great, but not bad. Fine for background music.
2. **""Dangerous""**: Repetitive. Howard Jones adds nothing to this song.
3. **""And We Run""**: Catchy but ridiculous. I really dislike rap. I bet a version without Xzibit would be good.
4. **""Paradise (What About Us?)""**: Interesting. Glad to see Tarja featured, but I don't think her voice meshes well with Sharon's. Overall I like it though.
5. **""Edge Of The World""**: Meh. Not memorable.
6. **""Silver Moonlight""**: Driving rhythm and growled vocals. Cool. Classic WT.
7. **""Covered By Roses""**: My favorite song on the album. Catchy chorus and melody.
8. **""Dog Days""**: OK, but gets repetitive and annoying at the end.
9. **""Tell Me Why""**: Decent, fits WT.
10. **""Whole World Is Watching""**: I hate this one and try to pretend it doesn't exist.

Bonus Tracks

11. **""Radioactive""**: I like it better than the original.
12. **""Summertime Sadness""**: Nice sound, fun to listen to.
13. **""Let Her Go""**: Fine, just not my taste.
14. **""Dirty Dancer""**: OK song.

It's fun to listen to all the evolution tracks and see how they arrived at the final song."
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","Paradise is excellent. Let Us Burn is pretty good. Dangerous, sure, I like it. But I strongly agree that the rest of the album is weak. The Unforgiving lost me at the first listen, but I later realized how much I actually loved it, like 2 years and a few more listens later, when I started to get back into WT. I figured it would take a few listens like The Unforgiving did. But, no. Never caught on. Bummed..."
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","I got the version of the album with the bonus evolution tracks, and it was cool to see that Tell Me Why at one point was a little heavier with more grunts. I kind of liked that version better, but that might just be because I'm a huge Epica fan and I'm used to harsh vocals, although early WT had them as well. 
Hydra is them experimenting with all genres and trying to branch out. Although Its definitely not my favorite album, I feel like it was good for them to try an album like this at some point, and their next album will probably be more focused/closer to their original style."
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","The Unforgiving was pretty great, largely because of how it was a concept album and it had a consistent tone and aesthetic to it.

I really disagree on Hydra though. I think it's a great album. Not amazing, but great. It's very experimental and draws influences from their previous albums, as well as other music genres, and it's one of the most innovative efforts I've seen in the symphonic rock/metal space."
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","The Unforgiving was pretty great. Hydra is terrible, with the exception of Paradise which is one of WT's best songs.

The fact that Hydra got good reviews can only mean that these reviews were written by monkeys. I can't find any other logical explanation. IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THOUGH, fans of symphonic metal will most likely shudder at the thought of Hydra, whereas it might be a high-quality production for the pop crowd. "
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","It gets good reviews because it's not being compared to their older music."
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","That album is really bad. I accepted 'The Unforgiving' which I didnt like before but I can't like Hydra at all. Its way too commercial for my likes. "
"Honest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?","I'm with you in that I hated it. I've listened to it twice, once when I got it and once six months later to see if it improved with age. 

I think the problem is for a lot of people that you can see a progression from the silent force-the heart of everything-the unforgiven. hydra seems to break that progression and as far as I can tell was made purely to break into America. 

TBH when they release another album I'm probably not going to buy it straight away like the mother's. I'll wait until I hear a dodgy copy to see if I like it. 

bands do this all the time though. I went from loving Metallica (pre load) to hating them (after load)."

Seriously Blessed He With Boils is such a rockstar album. "
"Xanthochroid - Incultus","I don't know they were working on new stuff. Do you know when it's scheduled to come out?"
"Xanthochroid - Incultus","If I'm not mistaken, late this year or early next year.

Matt already finished all of the drum recording for it."
"Xanthochroid - Incultus","Fucking sweet. Can't get enough of these guys."
"US based festivals/concerts?","Can we get a list of festivals/concerts that are either focused on symphonic music, or often feature symphonic bands?"
"US based festivals/concerts?","There's ProgPower USA which often features symphonic bands like Xandria, Kamelot, and Epica. Not sure if there's more, though. "
"US based festivals/concerts?","Paganfest is a multi-band tour that goes through North America every year during late spring/early summer. Though the bands are more folk metal, they do often feature symphonic elements. Last year featured Korpiklaani, Turisas, Chthonic, Varg, and Winterhymn. 

Montreal has a more generic, but very big, [heavy metal festival](http://heavymontreal.com/) in August, which also includes symphonic metal bands; this year Epica and Apocalyptica were present. "
"US based festivals/concerts?","Toronto also tends to have a version of a Heavy Metal Festival as well, but Montreal's lineups are far superior."
"US based festivals/concerts?","The 70,000 Tons of Metal cruise goes from Florida and often has symphonic metal bands. They've had Nightwish in the past, this year includes Apocalyptica and Therion.

There's a female-fronted metal festival in Chicago called Dame-Nation - if it's still going. And there's one called Flight of the Valkyries in Baltimore that's on in January 2015.

That's the only ones I know of that haven't been mentioned yet - ProgPower seems to be the one that has the most symphonic bands."
"US based festivals/concerts?","&gt; 70,000 Tons of Metal

I'm a little confused on the [pricing](http://70000tons.com/booking/pricing.php). If you buy a 2 person room, you have to pay 1,200 per person right? And if you go alone, you still have to pay that full 2 person price?"
"US based festivals/concerts?","It says you can pay $100 extra to go alone and they will match you up with another passenger to fill the room. And looks like you have to pay $333 dollars on top for taxes etc as well. It seems crazily expensive to me but then those are the fancier cabins, plus you are getting both a festival and a Caribbean cruise, I guess."
"US based festivals/concerts?","Cruises usually seem expensive and for a 'themed cruise' like this one it may be a bit high.  If you look at the price/day cost they're usually quite a good value."
"New bands suggestions.","Hey all, I love symphonic metal and as the title suggest, I'm looking for new bands.

I actually only listen to Within Temptation and Nightwish. I've heard of some songs from Epica and Sonata Artica, but I don't really know them and I feel my knowledge is very limited.

Now I would like to expand on this genre and need your assistance. Tell me about your favourite band and their song, or maybe the album that might get me hooked.

I got hooked to Within Temptation cause of The Heart of Everything and Nightwish got me with Once. Though I do love both of their earlier works once I listen to it more.

I'll try to listen to all of your listed choices."
"New bands suggestions.","I'm a big fan of Kamelot.  As for albums, I would start with Karma, Epica, and Black Halo."
"New bands suggestions.","Here are my band suggestions and albums/songs for you to start with:

1. **Xandria - ""Neverworld's End""**: The composition and vocals are similar in style to Nightwish's ""Once"" album. Since you like Once, you'll like Neverworld's End. Xandria's prior material is popular, but it has a much different feel (and different vocalists) and you may or may not like it as much. *Recommended Songs*: [Propecy of World's to Fall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vLwWtSwNTI) and [The Nomad's Crown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNAEXNEpimc)

2. **Delain - Lucidity**: Most people seem to recommend their ""April Rain"" album, but since you pointed out WT's The Heart of Everything, this album came to my mind. However, I recommend songs from both. *Recommended Songs*: [Frozen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhN4T4uhIWE), [No Compliance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT3_B3K_L6U), and [April Rain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzP0aY6BOjw)

3. **Epica - ""Design Your Universe""**: If you'll ever fall in love with Epica, it will probably be with this album. It's heavy, complex, and bombastic. *Recommended Songs*: [Kingdom of Heaven](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKRO117a_R8), and [Unleashed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNGzltK_tlc). Some people prefer Epica's older material though because it focuses more on symphonic melodies. A good older album to try is **""The Phantom Agony""** to see if you like that style. *Recommended Songs*: [The Phantom Agony](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtHgEwfiyNY) and [Cry for the Moon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjCivwBy-Bo)

4. **After Forever - ""After Forever""**: After Forever has a similar prog metal influence like Epica (they share common origins with Mark Jansen). This album features some electronic sounding elements that are not in their first albums. *Recommended Songs*: [Energize Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjm4BrNAf6s) and [Dreamflight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtqppn--D_c)

5. **Apocalyptica - ""Worlds Collide""**: Apocalyptica is a Cello quartet turned metal band. They usually are just instrumental but they have lots of songs featuring vocalists as well. I personally prefer vocalized music over instrumental, so I recommend songs that feature vocalists. *Recommended Songs*: [I Don't Care](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxDcWvZCSRg) and [S.O.S.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFZ9e4wx1H8)

6. **Kamelot - ""Epica"" &amp; ""The Black Halo""**: These albums are a two-part concept album featuring some of the greatest lyrics EVER. Kamelot is a power metal band primarily, so stylistically, this is different than your typical symphonic metal band. *Recommended Songs*: [Wander](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn4nzFmyNfw) and [Soul Society](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDubchjrz1I)

7. **Myrath - Tales of the Sands**: If you want to listen to a symphonic band based on Arabic melodies instead of Western symphony, then this is a must listen. It is a fresh twist on what you'll hear in this subreddit. *Recommended Songs*: [Tales of the Sands](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1g62x7qybA) and [Merciless Times](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMvqMHST2Is)

8. **Septic Flesh - ""The Great Mass""**: This is the heaviest band/album I'm linking to you, and you may not like it at all. Septic Flesh is Symphonic Death Metal, so expect the focus to be on harsh vocals and heavy guitars. However, the classic symphony melodies are so masterfully intertwined in their songs that I cannot make a list like this without including them. *Recommended Songs*: [A Great Mass of Death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBq_njJMdHg) and [Pyramid God](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoXrADZE4Rc)

Hope you find something new in there that you enjoy!"
"New bands suggestions.","My favourite bands are Nightwish and WT, so I'll have to cast my net a little wider, lol. I think you should definitely pursue more Epica. *Design You Universe* was the album that really made me love them - I feel like they are a more album-oriented band and you get a better feel for them by listening to whole albums than to their singles.

Delain would be another good one to get into - *April Rain* got me hooked on them, and their new album coming out in a week or so is good too. Since you like Nightwish, you might want to check out Tarja/Anette's solo careers or Floor Jansen's other bands, After Forever and ReVamp. You could always use free streaming things like Spotify or Last.fm so that you can try as much as possible!

Also check out the sidebar link for an A-Z of Symphonic Metal bands if you ever need more to get into. :)"
"New bands suggestions.","Do you like extreme metal? If so, check out [Fleshgod Apocalypse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sACuX2c9w8s). It is pretty much brutal death metal backed by an entire orchestra that is actually very well orchestrated.

Another great band, and slightly less extreme/more melodic is [Wintersun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm82gjZDIDU). This was one of the first symphonic artists I really got into.

[Summoning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HipoikwHRb8) is a black metal band that, although they use harsh vocals, really isn't that harsh. They are very atmospheric and peaceful. I often listen to these guys when I need to relax.

If you aren't into any extreme metal and prefer clean vocals, my only suggestion that hasn't been said already is [Blind Guardian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_ts8cPScXM).

The other posts in this thread are excellent suggestions as well, but I just wanted to throw in a few from other metal subgenres."
"New bands suggestions.","Try Epica with The Phantom Agony. The whole album though, like HarlequinValentine said, their albums are designed as a whole and really benefit from being listened as a whole. TPA being the best imo, almost all their album is a must-listen.

Try Sirenia, Krypteria, Xandria, Stratovarius. You can also try towards Rhapody of Fire/Apocalyptica.

Oh and, the one and only Therion.

You can also try Cradle of Filth, I personnaly don't like them but they are still considered as symphonic metal."
"New bands suggestions.","If you enjoy Nightwish (my personal favourite) and Within Temptation you will probably like Leaves' Eyes too. I can't believe it hasn't been mentioned yet, they're pretty big! 

Some other great bands that have already been mentioned: Epica, ReVamp, Therion (they pretty much invented the genre), After Forever, Tarja.

Sorry for not providing links, I'm on mobile. Some songs to check out:

Therion - To Mega Therion, Arrow from the Sun
Tarja - In for a Kill
Epica - Design Your Universe, Unleashed, Chasing the Dragon
ReVamp - Precibus, Trial of Monsters
Leaves' Eyes - Symphony of the Night, Elegy, Froya's Theme, Battle of Maldon
"
"New bands suggestions.","Branch into Power Metal if you haven't tried it yet.  [Dark Moor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV2mZE6KwE&amp;feature=kp) and [Rhapsody of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5kLxQGbRYg) are some of my favorites."
"New bands suggestions.","I love Epica, a good song to listen to by them is [Requiem For The Indifferent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhn0Wdc-tNM) from their album Requiem for the Indifferent. It's a great song that has everything, but my favorite album of theirs was Design your Universe. Definitely think you should start listening to them.

After Forever also had songs similar to Epica as they both shared similar members, but Floor was their lead singer and they weren't totally the same people so things sound different. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EguHM_8rgDY) is a sample song to see what they sound like. They don't exist anymore, but Epica is the closest thing.

I also think Amberian Dawn is quite an overlooked band as well. I really liked them when they had Heidi Parviainen as their lead singer, but when she left and was replaced with Capri, I started to like them less. I hated how they had Capri re-do the songs that Heidi did, but that's just me. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2R8_0NCW4A) is a sample song by them.

Floor was also in ReVamp before she officially joined Nightwish, I don't listen to them as much as others, but they might still be worth checking out."
"New bands suggestions.","ReVamp is still very much active! Nightwish won't stop Floor from continuing her own project. And it's definitely worth checking out, I recommend both their albums without reservation. "
"New bands suggestions.","In fact they will be touring in the US next month!"
"New bands suggestions.","[deleted]"
"New bands suggestions.","Definitely [Kamelot](http://grooveshark.com/#!/profile/Kamelot/22186712). Been my favorite band for several years. Brilliant music.

[Charon](http://grooveshark.com/#!/profile/Charon/22241677) is technically ""gothic metal"" but similar enough that you should check them out. 

[Sonata Arctica](http://grooveshark.com/#!/sonata_arctica) you've mentioned. I'd say they're somewhat of an acquired taste. Personally I go back and forth between loving them and cooling down. Favorite album is Winterheart's Guild.

[Freedom Call](http://grooveshark.com/#!/freedomcall). Technically power metal, but the genres have quite a bit of overlap.

Cheers!"

"New bands suggestions.","Besides what was already mentioned I can only suggest some old [Tristania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBjd2O2k3h0)"
"New bands suggestions.","I can't recommend Epica enough! Their whole discography is excellent. Particularly their newer stuff. More polished, heavier. The arrangements are great. Requiem for the Indifferent, Design Your Universe and The Divine Conspiracy are the albums you should check out first. The Divine Conspiracy was the first symphonic that I fell in love with Check out Kamelot too. Usually I prefer a female voice with symphonic metal, but Kamelot is an exception. Ghost Opera, The Black Halo and Silverthorn are my favorite albums."

"On this day in 1997: Nightwish released their debut album Angels Fall First. Copies of this first edition are rare and can be worth over $1000","It's pretty amusing, they recorded it in their school and (as the wiki says) sent it out as a demo, but it ended up getting released as it was. "

"Has anyone played Karmaflow, and if so, how did you find it?","I just bought (there's an Indiegala bundle selling it if you're interested) and installed it on Steam a few hours ago. Played until it crashed; game looks pretty but there are a few niggles I think need to be ironed out:

1. Lack of options to remap keys (*very* annoying for a left-hander like me).

2. The crashing, obviously.

3. I had to downgrade the graphics to medium for this -- seems pretty odd for a game that shouldn't take that much power to run. I could be wrong though.

Thoughts, people?"
"Has anyone played Karmaflow, and if so, how did you find it?","I'm having a good time with it. I'm not great at puzzle platformers, but the gameplay is pretty straightforward and easy to pick up. The environments are very pretty, and of course, the soundtrack is great. It's always fun recognizing the various vocalists.

It's about what I was expecting. Their Kickstarter didn't reach its goal, but they still delivered a pretty decent game that they've been patching regularly. They seem serious about making improvements and getting the bugs ironed out.

The thing that bugged me the most was that the intro seemed kinda phoned-in compared with the rest of the game. The white sketchy look over the purple/blue gradient looks kinda crappy compared with how beautiful the actual game is. Really wish they would have kicked up the production quality of that a few notches (or at least give players the option to skip past this part).

And yeah, to your third point, the game seems more of a resource hog than it should be. It's enough to make my GPU fan run constantly, which only really happens with monsters like Dragon Age and a heavily modded Skyrim. "
"Has anyone played Karmaflow, and if so, how did you find it?","Totally agreed. I wish I could remap the shift keys! At least I can move around with the arrow keys. Hoping Act II improves it significantly."
"Has anyone played Karmaflow, and if so, how did you find it?","I gave money to it when it was on Kickstarter, and they have delivered well. But it's very buggy. Like unplayable buggy. I'd say wait a little while longer while they are still patching it. What I've heard of the soundtrack is fabulous and the (intended) game is very solid."
"Has anyone played Karmaflow, and if so, how did you find it?","What am I missing here? "
"Has anyone played Karmaflow, and if so, how did you find it?","It's a puzzle platformer game that has musicians we know and love collaborating on the soundtrack (Charlotte Wessels, Elize Ryd, Simone Simons, Alissa White-Gluz, Mark Jansen and Ruud Jolie are the ones I can remember atm).

"Richard Dawkins will be heard on the upcoming Nightwish album","I'm incredibly amused that this was my guess in the Tuomas chatroom when he said it was someone who wasn't a musician. To be fair though, the band did keep wearing Dawkins t-shirts, which was a bit of a giveaway. 

I do wonder if they're basing the album or a song on *The Magic of Reality* then, since Tuomas has said he loves that book. Which could mean a possible Dave McKean collaboration (he illustrated the book). I'm kicking myself for not having asked Dave at a signing the other week, but then if he isn't involved he'd probably wonder what the hell I was on about."
"Richard Dawkins will be heard on the upcoming Nightwish album","Thematically speaking, such a concept would move Nightwish closer to ""Epica's"" realm of song topics. Should be interesting to compare!"
"Richard Dawkins will be heard on the upcoming Nightwish album","I doubt that his contribution will be a criticism of religion though, as Epica's would write. That just doesn't seem to fit Nightwish. I'm betting Dawkins' text will be something about the beauty of science or the amazing power of the scientific method."

"Nightwish single ""Élan"" to be released on February 13th","Have to say I really like the artwork. The t-shirt version is particularly cool. This is quite a big hint of what the whole album will look like.

The single features 2 additional versions of the song and a bonus track called ""Sagan"" - referring to Carl Sagan, I assume.

According to Google, Élan means ""enthusiastic vigor or liveliness"" in French and seems to have connotations of throwing oneself into something whole-heartedly (please correct me if I'm wrong!). That would explain the meaning behind the cover art."
"Nightwish single ""Élan"" to be released on February 13th","It does.

Its hard to explain, but its basically the reason you run before jumping a long distance, ""élan"" is what makes you go further. Can be roughly translated as ""run-up""/""momentum"".

Its also the french for moose :D"

"Nightwish single ""Élan"" to be released on February 13th","&gt;The underlying theme of the song is nothing less than the meaning of life, which can be something different for all of us. It's important to surrender yourself to the occasional 'free fall' and not to fear the path less travelled by. Élan is a wonderful teaser for the full-length album, giving out a little taste, but revealing very little of the actual Journey of Grandeur to come...

"Sonata Arctica - Juliet [6:02]",""
"Sonata Arctica - Juliet [6:02]","A lot of people don't like the Unia/DoG-era stuff, but I really like their more dramatic songs from the era. The less-heavy stuff is pretty bad though.

Thankfully, this song falls into the first category. Not my favorite(that goes to Deathaura), but one of the songs that sold me on post-Reckoning Night Sonata Arctica."
"Sonata Arctica - Juliet [6:02]","I was kinda iffy on this song UNTIL I saw them perform live. Tony pours so much more into the performance up on stage. Great song. "
"Sonata Arctica - Juliet [6:02]","I love this song, as I love this album. Reckoning Night reigns as my favorite album, but there is just something amazing about this one. Every song as that deep, meaningful, and catchy-in-a-good-way feel. 

This is, however, the beginning, along with Unia, of the slippery slope they have slid so far down. Needless to say, they took this less heavy, more full of drama and passion view too far and the result is the most recent 2 albums. 

When I heard ""The Wolves Die Young"" I had such high hopes for this album. The first time listening to it, however, I couldn't even finish. Each songs seems to depart further and further from the Sonata Arctica of old. 

I do nonetheleas have some hope for the future. Seeing them live this most recent NA tour, made me realize they are still a great band. I even enjoyed the songs from Pariah's Child live, despite themselves.

Sonata Arctica will always been one of my favorites, and I hope they will return soon to their former glory. "
"Sonata Arctica - Juliet [6:02]","I thought *Pariah's Child* was a pretty awesome album, and I refuse to acknowledge that an album exists between it and TDOG. Stuff like ""Blood"" and ""What Did You Do in the War, Dad?"" sound just like *Winterheart's Guild* and *Unia* fused together, and then you've got normal speedy stuff like ""X Marks the Spot"" and ""Running Lights"". It's definitely a very zany album at times, but it was one of my favorites last year after I almost wrote the band off when they released that abomination in 2012."

"I never got into Sonota Artica (they are symphonic right ?) - any recommendations ?","Sonata Arctica is really two bands; before their 2007 album *Unia*, they were standard power metal with some weak symphonic influences.

I am also from a place heavily influenced by rap culture so I also may have a much higher tolerance for rap than a lot symphonic metal fans. So don't take my opinion as absolute."

"LEAVES' EYES - Symphonies of the Night preview","Definitely another big change from their previous stuff, keeping it fresh.  

I'm a fan of this though, the samples, at least lorraine, seem much more operatic (ie: storytelling), which is a hugely welcomed change.  The composition is more metal-based by the samples, but we'll see what it's like overall. "
"LEAVES' EYES - Symphonies of the Night preview","I've never really listened to them, aren't they usually more folk metal? This sounds a lot like Neverworld's End Xandria (which is a good thing)."
"LEAVES' EYES - Symphonies of the Night preview","They said on Facebook that this album's theme is based on the Victorian gothic novel Carmilla, whereas usually their albums are based on Nordic culture/mythology, so I suppose that could be why it sounds less folky than their previous records. :)"
"LEAVES' EYES - Symphonies of the Night preview","Njord is the crown jewel of symphonic metal, and Meredead is a really lovely blend of symphonic metal and folk.  (Seriously, *lovely* is the most fitting word ever for it).  

Listen to *Frøya's Theme* and *Meredead* to get a good feel for their two masterpieces, they're seriously amazing.

Lyrics:

&gt;Try and define eternity  
&gt;No beginning and no end  
&gt;A world upside down  
&gt;Countless clouds on the ground  
&gt;I'm a figment of my imagination  

&gt;Hunt for tricks of light  
&gt;Thoughts painting colorful dimensions  

&gt;If we could roam through fantasies  
&gt;No more dusk and no more dawn  
&gt;Every little grain of sand  
&gt;Shapes the endless land  
&gt;Mirrors showing limitless reflections  

&gt;Hunt for tricks of light  
&gt;Thoughts painting new dimensions  
&gt;You can make our time stand still  
&gt;Come and breathe the sky  
&gt;Fly with the wings of true emotion  

&gt;And this time again  
&gt;It won't be the same  
&gt;Silent symphonies  
&gt;Playing eternally  
&gt;Every step I take  
&gt;Every bone I break  
&gt;Every memory  
&gt;Shatters sympathy  

&gt;Hunt for tricks of light  
&gt;Thoughts painting new dimensions  
&gt;You can make our time stand still  
&gt;Come and breathe the sky  
&gt;Fly with the wings of true emotions

I'M GETTING SCARED TOO."
"Nightwish reveal ""teaser"" t-shirt for upcoming album","I don't really think it'll be anything like Epica. It will be Tuomas's style, but with a theme of (I guess) nature and evolution. We've been theorising that it's based on the book The Magic of Reality, which focuses on how science can be beautiful and amazing. I think the lyrics will be just as poetic as ever.

I would say that Epica are much more political - the only nature songs I can think of that they've done are about things like oil spills and animals dying out, and how we should prevent those things from happening. So I think this will be very different."
"Nightwish reveal ""teaser"" t-shirt for upcoming album","Epica has an obsession with Deepak Chopra's version of quantum mechanics..."
"Nightwish reveal ""teaser"" t-shirt for upcoming album","I wouldn't mind that honestly.

"Nightwish reveal ""teaser"" t-shirt for upcoming album","I going to say this: Nightwish needs to update their branding. The ""logo"" is really old, tired and TBH amatuer looking now. It really doesn't match how much more professional they are compared to 1997 and how much they've grown. This shirt looks like it's got a great graphic theme, but the logo just kills it for me."
"Nightwish reveal ""teaser"" t-shirt for upcoming album","I imagine they keep it because it's all about having a consistent brand. Their logo is iconic and instantly recognisable now. I make images with band stuff and it's frustrating if a band has had 5 different logos... I often see Within Temptation's old logos getting used on official festival posters and things like that."

"LACUNA COIL - I Forgive (But I Won't Forget Your Name) (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","It's catchy, and while it is a bit generic, I enjoyed both the song and the video.

Andrea Ferro sounds really good on this track. I'm usually not a fan of his voice, but he gave a stellar performance here. "
"LACUNA COIL - I Forgive (But I Won't Forget Your Name) (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","To me it's a bit ""too generic"". Maybe it's just because I fear that Symphonic Metal could be drifting too much in to a mainstream direction, like WT's Hydra for example. 
Still, not a bad song."
"LACUNA COIL - I Forgive (But I Won't Forget Your Name) (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","I don't think Lacuna Coil are symphonic metal though, they're gothic metal leaning towards straight-up rock these days. They have occasionally used symphonic elements but not much."

"Thoughts on After Forever?","Overall my favorite SM band is Epica... however, I have been listening to the band After Forever a lot lately and in my opinion they were very good. Whereas Epica usually is lacking when performing live (Mark's grunts suffer when he has to grunt and play guitar at the same time and Simone generally sings pretty badly live) After Forever seemed to not have these issues... in the videos of concerts I watched, Floor sang very well with only minor issues with her highest notes, and Sander Gommans (guitar and grunts) could grunt like he did on the albums while playing guitar without mistakes in live shows. Performance-wise, I think AF was overall a better band, possibly with the exception of drums and lead guitar, which are at least as good or better in Epica. 

The albums Decipher and Invisible Circles (as well as the EP Exordium) also have live strings, which were mixed incredibly well in my opinion. I don't think the songwriting in AF's last two albums quite stands up to that of Epica, but their performance skills stayed sharp until they disbanded a few years back. 

I was wondering, if After Forever was still releasing albums and performing today, where do you think they'd rank among the major SM bands? Do you think it was a good decision on the band members' parts to break up while they were still at the height of their fame? "
"Thoughts on After Forever?","I don't think it's really fair to compare Simone to Floor, since Floor's voice is way more powerful.

Still, Epica are amazing live and have a great stage presence and a very charismatic attitude, which helps a lot, even if technically they don't live up to the higher standards (which I think is mostly due to the music being extremely loud when they play live, which overshadows and drowns out their vocal presence).

But yeah, After Forever is a very interesting band, because they're almost like 2 different bands, and they're sort of the symphonic metal equivalent of Tristania.

During the time Mark Jansen was in the band (before they kicked him out), they were essentially proto-Epica. Mark's influence on the songwriting, lyrical themes and atmosphere was incredibly obvious, to a point where it was probably suffocating and restricting Sander and Floor's creative freedoms.

Prison of Desire and Decipher and pretty great albums, and they share a similar style to The Phantom Agony from Epica (and arguably The Divine Conspiracy, to a small degree).

Post-Decipher AF, however, is hugely different. They shifted from that sort of symphonic gothic power metal thing they had going on to a much more symphonic progressive metal sound with lots of electronic/industrial elements to it.

While that made them a much more interesting and unique band compared to the rest of the genre (and later ended up influencing Epica with some of these new elements, which you can notice somewhat on Design Your Universe and Requiem for the Indifferent), the songwriting turned out to be very hit-and-miss.

Invisible Circles is a masterpiece, in my opinion, though I'm biased towards concept albums. Amazingly done overall, great concept, great lyrics, incredible vocal performances, melodies and a great chaotic/hectic pace with female vocals, growls, clean male vocals and choirs all creating a very dynamic and fresh feeling.

The worst part about it, as many people usually mention, are the narrative voiceovers, which were badly acted and interrupted the flow of the songs (and the album itself to some degree), which sort of ruined the album for a bunch of people, though I don't see it as a major flaw.

Remagine, however, was disappointing. And it's an album I really wanted to like. Aside from the fugly album cover, the album itself is full of boring/filler songs, has that ""samey"" feel to it where a lot of the songs seem similar and repetitive. That being said, there are some amazing tracks there (Forever, Only Everything, Living Shields, Free of Doubt and No Control are highlights of the album).

Then we have their self-titled and final album, which was very good overall. Not as great as Invisible Circles, definitely better than Remagine, but it suffered from some of the same issues, mostly the filler track issue.

In terms of production it's an awesome album, really heavy, aggressive and the orchestral parts are some of the best I've heard in the genre, but some of the songwriting felt weak and uninspired and didn't take advantage of that potential. Still, that album has Dreamflight in it, which is probably my favorite After Forever song (and there are a few other awesome tracks like Discord and De-Energized).

So yeah, basically I find them to be a great band, but also one was that was very inconsistent and never got to forge a strong identity. In the Mark Jansen days it was the Precursor to Epica, and after that, it sort of peaked at Invisible Circles and didn't really evolve or improve afterwards.

While it was unfortunate that they split, it seems like it was for the best, especially since in their open letter they mention not having enough passion or motivation to keep things going.

That modern AF vibe is still around though. If you listen to both ReVamp albums, HDK's latest album (Serenades of the Netherworld), and arguably MaYaN (at least the first album, Quarterpast), you still find a lot of bits and elements that are reminiscent of AF. Also, like I mentioned, some of Epica's recent material (Resign to Surrender, Deconstruct, Semblance of Liberty, Internal Warfare, Deter the Tyrant are some of the best examples, I think).

I still think of AF as one of the best bands in the genre. They're not as good as Epica, which are extremely well-rounded and very competent in every way, but they're possibly the best band from a technical standpoint. At the same time the songwriting was their biggest weakness. Amazing at times, really dull at others.

They're sort of the opposite of Nightwish, which I see as a very creative and imaginative band with pretty unique songwriting (at least from a melodic/aesthetic perspective, not necessarily from an instrumental one), but sort of weak from a technical standpoint (though Floor's current presence in the band changes that to some degree).

Heh, sorry for the wall of text. It's a bad habit."
"Thoughts on After Forever?","I read it all... Kudos for being legible in the age of texting and ayy lmaos! I agree very closely with you on what parts of After Forever I like... I can't decide whether Decipher or Invisible Circles is the best album; the former was basically the precursor for all of Epica and Epica-type bands (Diabulus in Musica, MaYaN,) but the latter is more progressive and was probably the defining album of After Forever as a unique band rather than a testing ground for Mark Jansen's songwriting. I like both these albums especially for the live strings and the quality of the performance (except the cheesy vocal parts which always annoy me at the end of Blind Pain... the talking in Between Love and Fire isn't that bad). 

If Reimagine and Prison of Desire had live strings I would have liked them more... but still not as much as IC or Decipher. The last album was a bit to ""poppy"" for my tastes but Discord, Withering Time, De-Energized, Dreamflight and maybe one of the others were pretty good.

I like MaYaN too... the heavier side of symphonic metal is my preferance, which may be why I liked After Forever a lot better than some of the lighter ones like Within Temptation and Nightwish's newer stuff. "
"Thoughts on After Forever?","I like both bands. When I saw Epica I thought Simone was absolutely amazing, and in any live video of hers I always think she sings beautifully so I'd like to see a video where you think she is singing poorly live."
"Thoughts on After Forever?","Check out the official Retrospect DVD... the rest of the musicians, choir, band were awesome... poor Simone just kept hitting bad notes, improvising in an almost cringeworthy manner, or singing certain notes quickly as if she was short of breath. :( It was quite sad because for 1, she sings amazingly on the albums, and for 2, that's likely the biggest show they will ever have, the DVD that could have made them 5x as famous, and her singing is the only real problem with it. That said, her singing was amazing on the Quantum Enigma album, probably the best she's ever sung. "
"Thoughts on After Forever?","Wasn't Simone pregnant when they recorded that? I think that was the main problem that caused her to underperform.

But yeah, I agree that the vocals on Retrospect were sub-par, though I don't mind them much.

Her vocals are definitely much better now, not only on TQE, but live too. I went to one of their concerts last November (3rd time seeing them live), and her vocals sounded way better, compared to the previous concerts I attended. Her voice is becoming more and more powerful, and she's managing to hit those high notes really well."
"Thoughts on After Forever?","She only sings well when she is very fresh. Tours fatigue her very quickly. "
"Thoughts on After Forever?","I listened to the Phantom Agony and it seems like she doesn't finish each word properly which is sad because it's one of my favorite songs by her. But I just looked up some info on that DVD...it was a 3 hour long concert? And not only that but she was a few months pregnant... I don't blame her for singing like she was out of breath!"
"Thoughts on After Forever?","Yeah, I agree, and that was one of her worst performances, but not too far out of the vein of how she normally sings in live concerts. "
"Thoughts on After Forever?","I actually thought Retrospect was one of her better performances. When I saw her prior to that, her vocals weren't that good. She said that she had extra singing lessons to prepare for Retrospect and I felt she'd improved because of that. When I saw the band at the end of last year she did a good job, though she still sings in a way that I find slightly strange. She often sounds sharp and quite a few times it was like she'd taken too long singing the lines and one would spill over into the other. (I apologise because I don't have any technical knowledge of singing and it's hard to explain what I mean!)"
"Thoughts on After Forever?","The vocals spilling over into the next line is her idea of improvisation I think... She is a very good singer when she sings normally but I think she is trying to introduce variety into the songs by doing what you just said, and it doesn't usually work out well (think of all of the ""over-sung"" Christmas song covers by famous artists, that have so many added notes, ornaments, and ""ooo-oooh""s that the original melody is hard to recognize). "
"Thoughts on After Forever?","That would make sense, actually! That probably is what she's going for."
"Thoughts on After Forever?","I *LOVE* AFTER FOREVER.

Floor is easily my favorite female symphonic metal singer - I absolutely love Decipher, and all of its strings and the oboe and aaaa. So many good songs on that album. My Pledge of Allegiance #1, Intrinsic especially, Imperfect Tenses, The Key, Forlorn Hope...

I'm really excited to see Floor with Nightwish, especially after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brcfttchzA). I'm seeing them in May and I'm so *pumped*.

Someone a little while back posted something here about AF's history, which was pretty cool, and it really brought out the subtle differences in style when they switched songwriters or whatever.

I dunno. I really love After Forever. Epica was the first SM band I'd listened to, followed by Kamelot (because of Roy Khan on Trois Vierges - seriously, I heard his voice and almost started believing in God), and then some less-symphonic stuff, like Rhapsody of Fire and Symphony X, and then came Nightwish, and after that, After Forever and Floor's other band Revamp.

I just love everything, I guess."
"Thoughts on After Forever?","I will agree with you on Floor being the best... During the videos I've watched of her live performances, she seems much more ""enthusiastic"" and energetic than Simone, for example, and her singing in live concerts is the best of any female SM singer that I know of. Decipher is awesome... as a composer myself, I can only say that the mixing and orchestration is some of the best I have ever heard for a SM album... even though the string section is small, it fits in wonderfully with the music. This was continued for Invisible Circles but abandoned for Reimagine... one of the reasons the last two albums aren't my favorites. "
"Thoughts on After Forever?","After Forever is still one of my all time favorite bands and I've listened to their stuff repeatedly. I'd agree that their songwriting was probably their biggest downfall, but there was something about the spirit behind the music that made it special. With some songs they really hit the nail on the head, and with others they included some parts that were just boring, not needed, sounded rushed, lacking in a strong melody, went on for too long. Epica suffer from this too, but AF's albums suffered a little too much, which is unfortunate because they put out a lot of amazing stuff overall. I found that they improved a lot over time, and that their last self-titled album is their best, finding the perfect balance between strong songs and technical displays. It was very well paced and the production is extremely solid. I actually think Transitory is one of the most awesome songs they ever made, and it wasn't symphonic at all - a drastic departure in sound for them.

I agree that Epica turned out to be the most successful and pure symphonic metal band. After Forever could have become that. It's sad because like I said, I think they peaked with their last album, and could have improved even more with future releases. At least they went out on top and have that to be proud of. Floor was always their strongest asset and a perfect vehicle for their music, so I really am looking forward to Endless Forms Most Beautiful. It will combine what I consider a legendary voice in metal with the songs of a legendary songwriter."
"Thoughts on After Forever?","I think in the first 3 AF albums at least, the melodies just take longer to appreciate than with other bands. In the last album there were only a few memorable melodies, and a lot that sounded too poppy. Still, even the last album was way better in my opinion than a lot of Nightwish's recent stuff or any of Within Temptation (just my opinion WT fans... not bashing you :))... "
"Thoughts on After Forever?","I saw them live a few times. Living in the Netherlands has its perks. They were always really good on stage, but their last few albums were too poppy for my liking so I wasn't that sad to see them disband.

Edit

They played The Final Countdown once, that's in my top 5 metal moments"
"Thoughts on After Forever?","Yeah, I wish they would have stayed away from the poppy sounds... some songs on the last two albums really suffered from this and it just wasn't the same as in Decipher or IC. "

"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","I've listened to TQE and DYU and I don't think I'm alone in saying the politically charged and motivating lyrics are one of the best aspects of both of these albums. Are there any other symphonic metal bands that have a similar appeal?"
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","After Forever's early work is EXTREMELY similar to Epica (Mark Jansen was actually in After Forever before he founded Epica). If you are looking for more Epica-like material, it doesn't get any closer than their first two albums *The Prison of Desire* and *Decipher*. Mark even wrote the lyrics to a lot of the songs too.

You can also look at Mark's side project MaYaN. It's more different musically, but the political lyrics will interest you! "
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","Can definitily recommend After Forever too, love all their albums. Other bands in the symphonic genre with this feeling? I don't think any other bands come as close as these 2. When looking at a genre a bit alike, progressive metal, there are lots of bands with this feeling. Dream Theater, Ayreon indeed(can be described as opera-metal, cause it has an opera set-up with like 6 famous singers featuring an album, very epic indeed) and many more can be found to have very well written and good lyrics."
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","I agree, MaYaN has similar but more aggressive lyrics to Epica... Regarding After Forever, Decipher is probably their best album and has some of the ""political"" stuff in it. ""Prison of Desire"" has a little of the religion/politics stuff but is not the album I recommend starting out with as they were not at the level of musicianship as with Decipher. You may also like AF's third album Invisible Circles... much more personal, but still protest... basically an opera about an abused child and her family, but metal as heck and quite progressive. "
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","They are very different bands, but I like Ayreon and Alisse White-Gluz's work (recent Arch Enemy, and before that, The Agonist.) Not quite Atheist Metal, but Ayreon has the ""project"" feel that Epica has, and AE/TA are political, in ways sometimes that might be as controversial as Epica's, to the right audience. And there's Otep, who's that to more of an extreme, and she can be uncomfortable to listen to if you're a carnivorous middle-class white dude."
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","Ooh, and I forgot to mention Delain. Their lyrics aren't as strong as other bands, and their politics don't seem controversial to me, but they've definitely got that energy."
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","Best Delian album, IYO?"
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","We Are The Others and The Human Contradiction are both good and equal enough in my mind. They've really grown as a band, so for a new listener, I'd suggest THC... :)

Lucidity was a concept album, it's good, but it doesn't sound like modern Delain to me. Love the Liv Kristine vocals though.

April Rain is good, too, but it doesn't have the emotional charge of the later albums, and I think Lucidity was better from a technical perspective."
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","Their latest, *The Human Contradiction*, is by far my favourite!"
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","Like others have mentioned, early After Forever and MaYaN were/are both led by Mark Jansen, so there's a lot of similarity there, especially in the lyric department.

Another band I also recommend is Orphaned Land. I still haven't listened to much from them, but their latest album, All Is One, is pretty great, and it's reminiscent of Epica in both sound and lyrics, but still very different."
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","I'm not that familiar with Within Temptations lyrical themes, but I think [Deceiver of Fools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj_KUKzGY08) may fit your discription."
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","Within Temptation ain't metal, Boy! "
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","Okay"
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","Wondering if the person above didn't realise they were in r/symphonicmetal. We even have a picture of Sharon in the banner, I think it's safe to say there's many WT fans here."
"Best bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?","That's what I thought but than I suddenly didn't care anymore. Maybe he really didn't realise he was in /r/symphonicmetal or he was just trolling. But I really have had enough of this ""this aint metal blah blah"". There was/is enough of this BS in /r/powermetal."

"Since we're on the topic of extremism and what's going on in the world right now, I think ""Blue Eyes"" from Within Temptation is also somewhat relevant.","This remake kills me.  It is *so* close to being an extraordinarily epic cover, and yet they fail to include the part where the Who rocks it out (""If I swallow anything evil, put your finger down my throat.."").  Just like the Limp Bizkit version, they try to make it only a ballad (thoug W/T *did* up-pace it a bit).

I would love to have heard a full cover."
"Since we're on the topic of extremism and what's going on in the world right now, I think ""Blue Eyes"" from Within Temptation is also somewhat relevant.","Uh I think you're thinking of another song..."
"Since we're on the topic of extremism and what's going on in the world right now, I think ""Blue Eyes"" from Within Temptation is also somewhat relevant.","Uhh, yea.  You're right."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I don't know what it is... But out of the 20 or so people I mentioned Epica to, most of them had reactions like ""they're terrible,"" or ""They're OK for what they are."" I brought Epica up on a long thread with a fellow metal-musician on a website and it they stopped replying! Only a couple other musicians had anything to say other than that they disliked Epica..... unless I come to subs like this where there are other fans. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Any ideas where this is coming from... I was just curious. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Honestly, for most of my friends, they like Epica up until Mark comes in with the growling. I personally don't mind him at all, but I do prefer Simone most of the time. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","He sounds like Cookie Monster."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Haha... I guess it did take me a while to get into the growling... but now I love it and growl along. Just an acquired musical taste I guess. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","For me, the issue is not the growling itself, but rather Mark doing it. I don't really like his style and I think there is a disparity in overall vocal skill between Simone and him (as long as comparing female and male vocalist makes any sense to you). "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","In my opinion Mark has some of the best growls out there... Especially on songs like The Obsessive Devotion. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I like Mark's growls, but I don't think they're the best; they could be better and, in my opinion, a little more deep. I'm more a fan of Mikael Åkerfeldt's harsh vocals from Opeth, although his harsh vocals are fickle (especially now).

However, I think Mark has the best harsh vocals in symphonic metal. I fucking love MaYaN. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","To get any deeper than Mark on TDC you'd have to either be a stinking bear or use voice manipulation technology. Do you have a song by Opeth that gets deeper than Mark in The Obsessive Devotion for example? 

(Kudos for being a MaYaN fan! I couldn't get the growls for ""Human Sacrifice"" out of my head since it came out. Melody in Antagonise was not as strong as in Quarterpast but the drums and vocals and sheer heaviness were awesome.)"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Mark's grows are actually very bad in comparison to actual death metal growlers. I remember watching or reading an interview a loooong time ago where he mentioned that he's not a natural growler. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I find that the growls (in all bands) are much more easier to appreciate once you know the lyrics. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Yeah... Though some like SepticFlesh's song ""Mad Architect"" I got addicted to it before I even had a clue what the growls were about. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I think their voices and singing styles are different from each other in a way that complements them both."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","The growl is definitely an acquired taste. Personally, I only like it as long as it is complimenting clean vocals, like it is in Epica."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I'm one of these people.  I love epica as long as they stay away from the death growl."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","It's satanic, evil metal music for us heathens that burn our first-borns while chanting *Mein Kampf* inside a pentagram.

...in other words, it's metal, and a lot of people don't like it, and some outright hate it. Throw in a female operatic singer, and it becomes a bit polarizing for a lot of metal fans, especially the modern metal fans and metalcore fans. Don't worry too much about it. Think about how much shit the people on /r/BABYMETAL must get."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","&gt; Throw in a female operatic singer, and it becomes a bit polarizing for a lot of metal fans, especially the modern metal fans and metalcore fans.

Smack these idiots accross the face with some old-school Nightwish."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Ha, you would think that the operatic vocals and orchestral elements would make it seem less evil to those who think metal is satanic... "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I come from the opposite end of the spectrum, I grew up listening to classical music and the classical elements was actually what attracted me to this genre. For me, the female operatic vocals and orchestration are what make things work. It's like the devil fighting the angel, it's the perfect balance.
"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Ha... that's where I came from too! Classically trained pianist and composer... now learning 7-string electric guitar due to Epica. I don't really see a ""fight"" going on in their music, but there is definitely a yin/yang element which is very pleasing once you've gotten used to it. 

I bet you will really like the song [Beethoven's Nightmare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTShSv-95uI) by Dragonland... It was my first metal song except for the classical covers from Epica's Classical Conspiracy and I found it awesome how they weaved Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata in and out of the music. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I usually only prefer bands with female lead singers, but I love that Dragonland song. It actually reminds me of [The Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7av8HmlfECs) by Dark Moor (the name of the song is awful lol). It's more like the Moonlight Sonata being mashed together with the 5th Symphony and turned into a power metal song...which coming from the classical world, was a bit strange at first but I love it now.  

My first taste of metal was actually from Metallica's S&amp;M album, that made me go on to youtube to look for their videos and someone posted a video that supposed to be them playing the Imperial March (it was terrible and no one actually thought it was them playing), someone in the comment mentioned ""Epica played this much better!""....more youtube searches later and I got into this rabbit hole. :-)"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","&gt; Someone in the comment mentioned ""Epica played this much better!""

How long ago was this? Could have been me who posted it! 

Dark Moor is awesome... At least for the albums Gates of Oblivion and Hall of the Olden Dreams (haven't listened to the others much). I wished so badly that they had a real orchestra for their version of Mozart's Dies Irae (well, more like song borrowing bits and pieces of the Requiem).  Same thing with Symphony X's Oddyssey. If the orchestra was real it would be 10x better... even though it's already like their best song. Back to DM... The song ""The Fall of Melnibone"" is one of their best but doesn't appear on any of the main albums. I can only find it on YouTube. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I think what he means to say is that other metal people don't like it as much. I have a friend who's liked Fleshgod Apocalypse less and less with each subsequent album because they've added in more and more of those elements with each release."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","&gt; Throw in a female operatic singer, and it becomes a bit polarizing for a lot of metal fans, 

you mean, symphonic metal in general"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Epica seems relatively unknown outside of the genre from what I've seen. Everyone I've mentioned them to either already loves them or never heard of them."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Eh, that was the case with some people... but so far my luck has been to find a few people who know about them who either think that they're ""gothic"" or ""terrible"" or ""OK for what they are."" Of course there was a bit of the gothicness as part of their image early on (e.g. Phantom Agony music vid) but there are far more elements to their style like classical, soundtrack-like and quality music, with a lack of ""depressing"" topics/riffs to fairly call them a gothic band... I guess the operatic vocals could be a part of why a lot of metalheads don't like them but IDK. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Well, for a starter it's death metal, and that's a big red flag in itself for many people. Regardless of it being melodic and symphonic (which has it's own effects), it has heavy riffs, distorted guitars, unusual rhythms, double kicks, solos/shredding, death growls, and overall is generally super theatrical, dramatic and intense to listen to. This will turn a large percentage away in itself. 

Other metal-heads I know rather enjoy it mostly, but there are some that find the theatrical/dramatic side of them to be a little too much similar to bands like Dimmu Borgir. They can usually appreciate the musical capabilities and achievements of Epica, but just find it's not really for them.

There is another large group, particularly South Americans that consider Epica, namely Simone Simons, to be racist. I'm baffled as to how they're so sure of this to the point where they make public hate pages against her and Epica. I've seen a couple of explanations and [videos as 'proof'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r9Zzctk7i8) saying she is apprehensive to let fans touch her and especially touch her hair at signings after shows etc. Considering how touchy feely South Americans are (as a cultural thing) I somewhat understand how they might think that, but it's totally unfair, I don't like people touching me and I'm not even famous. Personal space needs to be respected, especially when requested.

Another group of haters are religious groups (Muslims mostly) that hate on Epica because of their stance on free speech, religion etc. They have a song [Fools of Damnation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csYBwZPCleY) that receives a lot of hate from the Muslim community (those who know about it anyway), usually for the Arabic chant/melody they include in the beggining and throughout coupled with the lyrical theme about praying/kneeling/religions being foolish etc.

There are also those that claim Simone Simons is a ""diva"" and that she's not as pretty as everyone makes out (she's mega beautiful, how the fuck?!), and that she's up herself with her blogs and her appearance on stage, she brings the dignity of the band down, she's a terrible singer, a Tarja wannabe etc. Ridiculous.

So yeah, they definitely receive a lot of hate from quite a few different channels, but ya know what? I don't give a shit because fuck them, their opinions are fucking stupid, they don't make sense, they're just another bunch of crying babies pretending to be more offended ~~that~~ than they really are and fuck religion (especially Islam)."

Interesting notions. Calling Epica's music an actual death metal is perhaps a stretch, but you bring up a lot of good points that hasn't occurred to me before. Apart from anything else, this would partially explain why I'm not that much into this band."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Well, melodic death metal. I find them somewhat similar to the Swedish sort of death metal sound (Soilwork, Dark Tranquillity etc), rather than traditional death metal."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","They are not melodic death metal. They aren't even symphonic death metal."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Psst, this is the part where you actually contribute to the conversation and enlighten us all to what their true core genre might be. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Symphonic Metal?"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Just enough growls to be annoying for mainstream music fans, too few growls to be gratifying for hardcore death metal/screamo fans... just the right amount of growls for Epica fans! I think we're getting somewhere here. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Yeah, I don't really consider them strongly death metal either, except for some of their more recent work (the heavier DYU and TQE songs would kinda qualify)."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Did you hear Stay the Course from RFTI... That was pretty much as close as they ever got to full on death metal... outside of Semblance of Liberty and the bonus track Incentive from DYU."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Yeah. I think Martyr of the Free Word, Kingdom of Heaven and Victims of Contingency are more ""death metal-y"" than Stay the Course, but it definitely seemed to have some influence."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Ha... someone who thinks Epica is death metal! You should hear Mark's band MaYaN. But yes I like the growls unlike a lot of people.

Racist? My gosh! Those people were practically swarming her, she has every right to ask them politely to stop... I for one would probably not be so polite about it as I have a need for some personal space. If they thought she was racist, why do they think she sings concerts in their countries in the first place? I had never heard about this before, thanks for informing me. 

I guess I understand the religious nuts' point, but I side with Epica in the views posited in their songs. I think they're quite brave to write songs about Islam, especially considering what has happened to many who criticize the worst of the major religions. 

The one reason I could see for people to not like Epica is that Simone's singing is often not up to par with her ""album voice"" ... probably because the concerts are so loud she can't hear herself. I don't know but Retrospect was a fiasco in this sense, and I'm a HUGE fan of Epica's music. When it comes down to it though most popular bands' singers are worse live than they are on the albums, and at least Simone has the guts to use her real voice instead of being auto-tuned like Justin Bieber or his ilk. 

Never heard of the racist thing before... thanks once again for comprehensive answer. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","They're certainly a form of death metal, perhaps not extreme, traditional  or brutal, of course, but I find most of their songs have some strong melodic death metal elements to it. Like I said in the other comment think more Scandinavian/Swedish death metal like Soilwork, In Flames, Dark Tranquillity etc. If I was gonna be super picky and anal about what style I'd call them, it's probably be: Neo-Classical/Symphonic, Melodic and Gothic Death Metal."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I'd call them Symphonic Progressive Death Metal, post-TDC."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","That's more like MaYaN's label... Too many clean vocals and choirs in Epica to be Death metal... I think the growls have to be over 50% of the vocals before it's really DM... "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Yeah, MaYaN are definitely symphonic progressive death metal. Epica have some bits of it, but not all that much."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Yeah, Simone's voice isn't the most powerful, especially compared to people like Tarja or Floor, but she makes up for it with her versatility and her soft/""angelic"" tone."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Yeah...I wish I could hear Epica perform with Floor as the lead... She is usually a lot more on tune, but I agree that Simone's voice is the most angelic... Floor's is a lot more ""dirty"" if you know what I mean. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","If Simone were to leave the band, I agree that Floor would be the best replacement (and it'd be in a way more reminiscent of early After Forever), but that would suck really bad.

I'm really happy Floor is with Nightwish now, she's pretty much a perfect fit there."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Darn... I still haven't heard Floor in NW... Last I heard from her was in ReVamp... which is decent but not quite AF quality. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Their Ghost Love Score performance in Buenos Aires was mindblowingly beautiful."

"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","This and the performance at [Wacken Open Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr9nbCdJZHg). Amazing!"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Revamp isn't symphonic metal in the same vein as the rest. Revamp is prog metal. It shares more in common with dream theatre than after forever."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","the reason simone isn't like her album voice is she has no formal training for that style of singing. Her and Anette Olzen have a bad habit of being flat when they perform."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I'm trying to think what reactions towards them I've heard. Amongst symphonic metal fans, the vast majority love them or at least appreciate them to some extent (discounting trolls/people who think Simone is a diva etc). With general metal fans, they seem to have the gut reaction of ""oh, it's a female singer and it's a bit operatic, I don't like it"". I have successfully converted a few of those...

I don't think I've ever met anyone who'd properly listened to them and decided they were bad, though. I did nearly get into an argument with someone on r/metal who said they were ""tasteless"" - apparently he/she meant they thought Epica didn't combine metal and classical in a tasteful way. At least that's more of a valid criticism than people who just say they're bad without any proper consideration.

I've actually had a lot more negative reactions to me liking Nightwish and Within Temptation. Someone once stopped talking to me in a metal club when I said I liked Nightwish. And I used to know these two guys who (I was told) laughed at me behind my back because they thought I was stupid for enjoying WT. Sigh..."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","&gt; With general metal fans, they seem to have the gut reaction of ""oh, it's a female singer and it's a bit operatic, I don't like it"". 

Oh man, they have *no* idea what they're missing out on.

Idiots, imo. Nobody should have the right to judge someone's worth on the basis of their preferred music. Listen to what you enjoy. Art is subjective, after all."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","W-W-W-Within Temptation?!?! Heh... hehe... haha... You're entitled to your opinion but WITHIN TEMPTATION IS NOT METAL! But Nightwish is cool... especially Dark Chest of Wonders, Kinslayer etc. Then again, if you have any WT songs that are more hard-core than I'd be happy to listen to them. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I don't see why it matters what genre they are. I don't only listen to metal. However I'm more inclined to believe the vast majority of people who do consider them to be symphonic metal (this sub is pretty good evidence for that) or at least symphonic rock, since that's what the band have labelled themselves. I would still love their music no matter what category people put them under.

With WT it's all about the epic feeling, the orchestration. Their latest album was more generic and although it had more songs with prominent guitars and some harsh vocals, people proclaimed it to be a more commercial record. When it comes to their previous albums, I've never heard any pop or rock that sounds at all close. Maybe try The Heart of Everything, but if you just go looking for how metal something is instead of the quality of the music, then you may be disappointed."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I like a lot of classical and soundtrack music too... but I listened to a couple of WT's albums (the first one and The Unforgiving) and thought the songs were quite repetitive. I can agree that there is a lot of good music outside of Metal though. I love Mozart's Requiem. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Ah, I would definitely suggest giving The Heart of Everything a go then - for me it's their best symphonic album. They might just not be for you, though. I mean there are plenty of bands that everyone loves that I just can't get into."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Thanks... I'll see how it goes! "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Don't you think it's a little ironic that you're reacting to WT fans in the exact same manner that people react to you for liking Epica? While WT isn't an exemplary metal band, and while their music contains some of symphonic metal's biggest weaknesses at times, it's definitely still metal (other than The Unforgiving). Even the guys at Encyclopaedia Metallica think so, and they're incredibly elitist when it comes to accepting fringe bands as metal."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I'm not saying that what Epica criticizers are saying is ethically wrong or that people should not be able to criticize bands including Epica, I just wanted to know what the rationale for the dislike was so I could have better examples to give when someone says something vague like ""they're terrible."" 

With Within Temptation, I have a few very specific criticisms - from what I've heard they don't have many heavy riffs, the songs are very repetitive, and the songwriting borders on ""dark"" pop many times. Actually though the Unforgiving was the main album I listened to so maybe I just dislike that one and their others are somewhat better. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Within Temptation's music differs considerably from album to album, listening mostly to The Unforgiving doesn't do them justice (especially as it's their most unusual album). The Heart of Everything and The Silent Force are pretty similar, both being typical symphonic gothic metal albums (I personally prefer THoE because there's more variation from song to song). The Unforgiving is ""symphonic rock"", although I'm not too sure about the symphonic part. Mother Earth is a surprisingly light album despite the metal elements threaded throughout the album. I couldn't get into Mother Earth despite several attempts, but the title track and Ice Queen are both definitely worth listening to. Hydra's a mix of their last three albums with a mainstream appeal (unsurprisingly it's kinda average).

While I'd say your criticisms of Within Temptation are definitely valid, I don't think that necessarily makes their music *bad*. It certainly makes them less metal and less symphonic than others, and they're definitely not a band I would hold up as an example of what the genre can be at it's best. However, they're great if you want to just stop thinking and listen to some pop metal.

Criticisms of Epica are largely in the same vein as those said about Within Temptation: their symphonic elements and their metal elements are both pretty good, but they're nothing special. What makes them a good band is the fusion of the two at the same time. If people don't like some of those elements (e.g. growling vocals) then they're not going to like Epica."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","WT used to be Symphonic Metal. :("
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","To give them credit, they still make some pretty good music (arguably better than their early stuff) and they used growls in their latest album, to my surprise."

Then ""[Stand My Ground](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sCkAvh50Vs])"" comes on and curb stomps anything they've made in this decade.

""See Who I Am"" plays and suddenly Sharon del Adel is demonstrating range.
"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Heh. I do like The Silent Force quite a bit, but not the first 2 albums.

The Heart of Everything was their best work though, I think, and it's also the album that got me into symphonic metal. There are some really great songs there."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I personally felt The Unforgiving was better, but their most symphonic song IMO did come in The Heart of Everything (The Truth Beneath the Rose, anyone?)"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Wow, somehow I own all their other albums and somehow haven't heard any of the original songs on The Heart of Everything!"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Some people, myself included, love Epica's  music until the growling steps in the picture.  
Many bands would be better off without growling **in my opinion**. To name a few: Epica, The Agonist, Amaranthe.  
But, I'm picky about my music and often receive hatred about it :-)"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I don't really care for them. I'm a huge Nightwish and within temptation fan though.  "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Within Temptation... BAH HUMBUG. I am not a fan of them... Not heavy enough. XD

NW on the other hand I can handle... still not as hard core as Epica though. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Whaaaaat?!  That's crazy to me!  I haven't heard a whole lot from Epica but what I have heard, it just seems like a Nightwish copycat that can't quite catch the same magic that Nightwish have.  But perhaps I just haven't heard the right stuff.  Same might apply to you in regards to WT.  I'll come back later when I'm not on mobile and post something for you.  "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","They are a Nightwish copycat, except in any way whatsoever.  Their music is more harsh.  The guitars/bass far more distorted.  Lyrically the two bands are worlds apart.  Nightwish has a lot of fantasy/emotional stuff while Epica tends to be politically/world event driven.

In fact, Epica has taken far more from Kamelot than Nightwish.  Shit, the band's name was Sahara Dust until Kamelot released their album ""Epica.""  And Epica's sound, if we have to say it is influenced by another band, is far closer to Kamelot's than Nightwish's."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Is that with fellow metalheads or ""normies""?  I love epica personally."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Mostly ""normies""... Two other metalheads I showed it to thought the lyrics were amazing and thought the band was awesome... One former Epica fan though thinks they're too ""gothic."" I guess they're as gothic as the next metal band, but they haven't milked that audience for at least their last 4 albums. (I can see why ""Mother of Light"" and ""The Phantom Agony"" would have that vibe due to the lyrics but still... they don't flaunt gothicness the way bands like Lacuna Coil or WT or even Delain do, especially lately. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I don't even know what ""gothic"" means anymore, considering how often it gets misused.

To me, gothic is Tristania, early (and most recent) Sirenia, Draconian, Theatre of Tragedy, etc.

I never understood why so many people call bands like Epica, Nightwish and Within Temptation (apart from their first album) ""gothic""."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","To me, gothic is music with depressing lyrics and music... Epica's closest to gothic is probably Serenade of Self-Destruction followed by Mother of Light, which are both about suicide... Mother of Light is actually pretty determined and more ""angry"" than depressing though... the tune is awesome. SOSD is more sad/desperate sounding, but the overall intellectuality of the sentiment and the genius of the song takes it far beyond the realm of emo-gothicness. The rest of their work is generally more philosophical or political than something written to appeal to the gothic tastes of death, bleakness and depression. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Huh, had no idea Mother of Light was about suicide. Serenade is a masterpiece though, and yeah, I don't really find it very depressing or nihilistic as much as an open-minded look at the topic and the validity/merit of suicide."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Yeah... It's probably the best song on the topic I've ever heard, and in my opinion way less gothic than depressing ""pop"" songs like the one that goes ""staring down the barrel of a .45"" etc. Mother of Light was actually like the third Epica song I ever heard and I liked it months before I went full-out Epica fan. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","idunno, most metal heads I know like them, probably my favorite symphonic band, I actually like them quite a bit more than Nightwish"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I think Epica makes great sounding music. Foobar shows 30 listens to TQE alone.

That being said, I think their lyrics are very weak in comparison with their sound. Victims of Contingency is especially noteworthy in this regard.

I don't listen to them when I want to feel anything other than pumped up."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Huh, I never experienced this.  Some of my friends are metalheads, but they prefer older bands like Iron Maiden and Metallica, or in the case of one friend more folk metal like Eluveitie.  I seem to be the only one who prefers the more symphonic metal bands like Nightwish, Epica, Leaves' Eyes, and so on.

My friends don't really seem to have an opinion on Epica likely because they haven't listened to the band enough.  It's weird with my group of friends, we have two people who prefers old-style heavy metal, one who prefers more folk metal, and myself who prefers symphonic and power metal."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Took me a bit to get use to the growls. But,  musically love them. Cant wait to see them again"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","From my own experiences, I have heard mostly negative views on the band. Although, they're shallow insults at best that really tell you nothing, such as ""They suck"" or ""I hate that band"".

One such argument with one of my friends is sad, as he basically says ""How can you like Epica if you like bands like Iced Earth and Blind Guardian?"", or my ""favourite"" argument of ""You're opinion doesn't matter because you like Epica*)

* Epica can be interchanged with Nightwish, After Forever or Edenbridge

But as I've said, I have heard good reviews, but it's from people who want to listen to Symphonic Metal."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Huh... I have listened to most of Blind Guardian's stuff a few times, and while I like them, they just don't compare to Epica in my opinion. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","People don't like Epica?  If I mention them to anyone they don't know who they are. I don't have any metal head friends... T_T 

I found the growls difficult to like at first (I'm really, really picky when it comes to metal.) but I got used to them and now Epica is my favourite band."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Ha... same here with the growls - used to hate them, now they're like the best part, and I growl along... I only have like 2 metalhead friends and we only speak occasionally, but they seemed to like Epica OK. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","That's a reaction i've seen from many people towards female-fronted metal, which I love. For some metal must be more masculine and that's ok. To each his own."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I think the growls and heavy guitars/drums make it pretty masculine. Having the female vocals adds a nice dynamic to that I think... I don't think they'd be as good with male clean vocals... maybe if they changed the style a bit but the call and response between Simone and Mark that they use in a lot of songs is awesome. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Yeah, if I had to choose the ""manliest"" symphonic metal band, it'd definitely be Epica. They have a really strong/blunt presence and vibe compared to other bands in the genre."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I have experienced the opposite actually. All the non metal listeners that have experienced Epica have liked it at least a little."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I certainly have no hate for them, I've just never heard any songs from them that really grabbed my attention.  I don't see the hate though, going to my usual concerts the last few years (Nightwish, Delain, Within Temptation, Kamalot, etc) I hear nothing but praise from people I chat with.  I'm usually the odd one out because I'm not a total fanatic for them."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","[deleted]"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I think it has something to do with how snobbish certain metal fans can get when you're not listening to something they like. It's pretty much herd mentality -- if you're not with me, then you're my enemy. Some of them seem to think being a metal fan also means being 3 edgy 5 u for some odd reason...

Pretty sure my love for Within Temptation and Amaranthe would have me being labelled as not being a 'true' metalhead by people like those, but in all honesty, who really gives a storming fuck? Listen to what you enjoy. Everything else is just white noise and irrelevant."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I don't hate Epica, but they make a very average music, often even boring when it comes to singing. I wished they would make more out of their instruments and vocals. Their songs never spoke to me, they lack creativity and depth :-(
I didn't know many people hate them, though."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","hm, i don't think you've actually listened to a lot of their songs.

what are your views on the ""new age dawns"" songs?"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","The Last Crusade - actually very nice :-)
Mother Of Light - somehow free of emotion and, yes, boring.
Consign To Oblivion - too long, and not thrilling enough for that length, gets repetitive; I like the first transition from the female voice to the growls, though, it's really well done.
Resign To Surrender - repetitive; I think if you make repetitive music, there should be at least a cool melody you are looking forward to hear again.
Kingdom Of Heaven - the intro is too long, unnecessary repetitions, then it gets more powerful, but it's unemotional again. 
Design Your Universe - very cool till she starts singing for the first time as the melody is, sorry to say that again, borring.
I think, the songs lack emotions, something that would make you 'Wow'. I love the instruments and the power, and I think the combination of the female voice and the growling can be really interesting. I just wished they were emotionally more expressive. Sometimes the instruments sound like being randomly put together, without any deeper idea behind the song. That's only my impression, of course. I think, Epica has all the potential, they only need a more creative song writer ;-)."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","haha, you and i have very opposite opinions"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Haha, well, that's interesting about the world. People are individuals and have various preferences and opinions. If we would agree on everything, there would be nothing left to discuss, and THIS would be more boring than the music of Epica, hehe ;-) No, it's not that bad. I prefer Epica to pop music *shudder* ANY TIME!"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","it's just that you say stuff like ""it lacks emotions and it doesn't make me go ""wow"""" and yet those are the exact feelings i feel when i hear the songs: design your universe, consign to oblivion, kingdom of heaven(btw, in this song, just imagine the mayan civilization being built in fast motion and a slave whom thought life was now different now that there is a new king has his world turned upside down), return to surrender, and mother of light.
"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","It's good to hear that these songs touch you. It was nice talking to you, Endrance88. Maybe we'll run into each other in another discussion about another band again :-) Take care!"
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","They definitely don't lack creativity, depth or instrumental variety.

That being said though, I know some people will get sort of turned off because a lot of their music can sound somewhat formulaic, repetitive and ""dry""/unemotional."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","You read my mind, Archanoth. That is exactly what I meant: formulaic, ""repetitive and ""dry""/unemotional. You put it better in words than I ever could. Thank you."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I think the problem is that they are fairly average musicians, but very good entertainers and they cater to a very specific niché.

So either you love them because they write exactly what you love and want to hear or you hate them for being too harsh (casual listener) or not harsh enough (""TRVE METAL PLS"")."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Unleashed, Storm the Sorrow and Never Enough were fairly repetitive... most of the others not so much. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Heh, I find it funny that you mentioned all the singles. I also tend to find singles fairly boring, though I quite like Unleashed and Storm the Sorrow.

For me, some of the worst offenders would be Menace of Vanity, The Divine Conspiracy title track, Guilty Demeanor, Never Enough as well, and probably a few tracks in Consign to Oblivion.

Vast majority of their songs are really great though."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Boring?! Welcome to my bad side! &gt;:) "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","My problem with Epica is they're just kind of a generic hodgepodge of wildly different metal and classical tropes, that don't often go well together. The classical bits are written in the same vein as Nightwish, but lack subtly. The guitars seem to oscillate between groove metal and ""radio"" metal, sometimes being adventurous with rhythms; others staying very much in the safe zone. Simone is a good singer, but lacks power and conviction. Mark also is skilled, but doesn't do anything special. The drums are standard fare for heavy metal- not very technically challenging, very consistent beats that act as a fancy metronome. I haven't ever paid attention to their bassist, so I can't speak of that. 

Don't get me wrong; I like Epica. They're cool. They just don't bring anything special to the table. They have found their comfort zone in being a hybrid of Kamelot, Nightwish, and Lacuna Coil; and I doubt they are going to stray from that.

My main reason for REALLY liking bands, being a musician myself, is that they bring something unique or special to the table. For Archspire and The Faceless, it's technical wankery. For Nightwish and Fleshgod Apocolypse, it's amazing songwriting. For Dying Fetus and Slipknot, it's stage presence in general. For Ne Obliviscaris and Korpiklaani, it's the vocal delivery. For Beyond Creation and Meshuggah, it's the tonalities. For Machine Head and The Haunted, it's the banging riffs. 

Epica just isn't special in any way."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I am not sure if we are listening to the same band?

If anything, I would compare Epicas classical progness to Therion. NWs writes symphonic power metal with very epic fantasy themes, the songs are very catchy but the orchestration/keyboard is fairly simple (at least after Oceanborn). Epica writes about ""real"" topics, such as religion and science.

Also, almost all other Symphonic Metal bands in the same vein don't use harsh vocals (with few exceptions), like Amberian Dawn, Sirenia, Xandria, Within Temptation, Visions of Atlantis, ...

And I don't see any musical connection to LC."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I'm a casual fan, but was looking forward to seeing them live when they opened for Symphony X about 7 years ago or so. This was the tour where Amanda Sommerville filled in for a sick Simone and they were absolutely awful live.

Every song they played sounded the same and the growls were horrendous. I like some death metal, and I'm a huge fan of the Gothenburg metal scene so I have nothing against growls, but Mark Jansen's growls are unbearable. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","I agree that Mark's live growls are sub-par... I think he has a hard time playing guitar and growling at the same time... a problem Sander Gommans (After Forever) didn't seem to have. "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","some people just think they are too badass for some things when really they are a pathetic waste of human life down in their mom's basement."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Is this insulting Epica or supporting it? "
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","lol now that you are confused, i will never tell."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","Absolutely love them. Except that Simone's voice has gotten a lot less powerful live.."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","It depends on the gig. At the beginning of the tour she sings very well but has trouble on extended tours. Other symphonic metal bands have that problem as well. I think Therion are switching to another type of soprano for that exact reason."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","It's more a technique problem I think, professional classical/opera singers are trained to be able to sing very frequently for extended amounts of time."
"Why so much hate for Epica in the general population?","If anything it's definitely become much stronger"

"Live Events (long-ish post with a few questions)","I have yet to ever be able to experience any band live, and with Kamelot/Nightwish both coming to my area next spring, I'd love to be able to do so, now that I have the money to be able to do so. I don't have anyone to go with, but one of my best friends said he'd be willing to go just so I have someone to be with.

So, that led me to wonder about pricing:

Kamelot/Dragonforce - $30 normal, $100 VIP Preshow/Meet-greet/Poster

Nightwish/Delain - $35 normal, $180 VIP Preshow/Meet-greet/poster/Tour program

I'm not familiar with pricing, but $180 seems a bit excessive ($100 is pushing it a bit, but sounds fair to me)...what would this ""tour program"" contain? If I'm bringing a friend along, There's no way I'm paying $360 to bring him along with that part. 

Also, from what I've picked up, Epica coming to North America has been scrapped...any talks of that being re-arranged? Was really excited to see them all in one year :c

Side question - Are Simone/Floor/Tommy known for being good singers, even when live? I understand nothing is going to be studio-quality, but it's a huge let down when I listen to a band live and the singer's voice is all over the place...ruins half the song for me &gt;.&lt;"
"Live Events (long-ish post with a few questions)","the VIP packages especially the Nightwish one are pretty expensive.. I usually try to emulate a free one by stalking the band in the back-lane before and after the show or in the venue after to try and get a signature and rip off a tour poster from a wall/telephone pole "
"Live Events (long-ish post with a few questions)","You have to remember that bands don't make a whole lot off the sale of their music, and in the case of these bands that are not well known in the US, they need to use anything they can to help cover expenses and make money beyond just the merchandise table. Final stop of Kamelots US tour was in Orlando and the House of Blues in Downtown Disney and was not even close to sold out. You can bet booking that location barely let them break even before merchandise. VIP tickets are simply a luxury for people willing to spend the extra money to support the band. It being worth it is truly up to you.

And yes Tommy and Floor are excellent live. Seen them both on their last US tours.

That being said, the vip for Nightwish in Orlando was a mess. No time for photos with the whole band. All you could do was lean down in front of the signing table for a quick photo. The tour was a mess though with the stuff going on behind the scenes. Despite that I have purchased vip tickets for the Orlando show next year too. I hope I can get a better picture with the whole band this time."
"Live Events (long-ish post with a few questions)","I saw Kamelot open for Nightwish 2 years ago, right after Tommy joined - he is amazing. The whole band is. They were every bit as good as Nightwish IMHO. It was one of Anette's last gigs, she also impressed me. Can't wait to see Floor though on this next tour. Just check out Nightwish Wacken 2013 on Youtube. "
"Live Events (long-ish post with a few questions)","&gt;Side question - Are Simone/Floor/Tommy known for being good singers, even when live? I understand nothing is going to be studio-quality, but it's a huge let down when I listen to a band live and the singer's voice is all over the place...ruins half the song for me &gt;.&lt;

I've heard criticism of Simone for her live performance, but when I saw Epica this summer I thought she did an amazing job. 

Floor is something special. I've never heard anyone say anything negative about her live performances. She is amazing. Best vocalist in all of metal in my opinion."
"Live Events (long-ish post with a few questions)","I've seen some older performances of Simone and it left a lot to be desired...I'm sure Floor is amazing, based on the clips I've seen from DVD's. I'm sure those are fixed up a bit (the audio) but she's still amazing."
"Live Events (long-ish post with a few questions)","I know you didn't ask about her, but I can only tell you that Charlotte Wessels from Delain is a powerhouse live. She interacts with the crowd, she belts it out, and shes lovely in person. Delain are a fantastic band to see live. Tey have ann amaing energy and really good songs. From what I've seen on youtube and heard about, Floor is amazing live, too.

$180 is in my opinion a lot of money. If the band are worth that much to meet and you have the money, by all means go for it, but don't expect to be chatting to them for too long I guess.
"
"Live Events (long-ish post with a few questions)","If I can get a chance to even ask one thing to one of the band members, I'd love that...but $180 is pushing it. As much as I literally regard Tuomas/Marco/Floor (Marco especially) as gods to me, I don't think $180 is within my comfortable range.

I'm not as familiar with appreciating the work behind Kamelot, but $100 is closer to what I'd be willing to pay if it means to spend some brief moments with Thomas/Tommy, that'd be good."
"Live Events (long-ish post with a few questions)","I think you have your answer, then. Marco is a sweetie and I love him too, but I wouldn't pay $180 for what would only be a 2 minute chat. If I was rich I would but I'm not.

Just enjoy the show, belt out your favourite tunes and if possible stalk the tour bus :P"
"Live Events (long-ish post with a few questions)","I've done Kamelot and Iced Earth VIP before (though I really only did Kamelot on the slight chance that it would mean meeting Delain--didn't there, but did get a pic with her after the show!).  


Kamelot was a quick run by the table for autographs, then another line to get pictures with the band.  It went fairly efficiently.  I think that one was around $75-100 or so as you said.


Iced Earth ran the same way, but was AFTER the show.  The show ended probably around 12:30am, and the meet &amp; greet didn't happen for another hour after that, but otherwise ran the same way.  A quick run down the table for autographs and handshakes, then another line to do photos after that was done.  I think it was somewhere around $65 or so.


My brother and I both got the full VIP tickets for Nightwish minutes after they went on sale.  These are by far the most expensive tickets either of us has ever gotten for any concert.  


Adding Floor is probably what sealed the deal with me.  While I've been to about 6 Nightwish concerts so far, I never saw Tarja in person--only Annette and Floor.  I saw Floor he third show after joining and she was fucking amazing.  I feel she beats Tarja hands down, and I don't think any sane person questions holding Annette against either of them.


Remember, her THIRD show.  I was up against the stage by her monitor, and got a chuckle when the crew came out with their entire set of lyrics printed out on a taped up grid of 4 x 3 sheets of paper and taped it over the monitor.  The only time I heard her even slightly stumble was--I *think*--she repeated a verse on Over The Hills and Far Away.  She absolutely nailed everything else.


The only thing that bothered me was they didn't start doing Ghost Love Score with her until a few shows later (maybe even not until they got to South America).  This is by far my favorite song from them, and the only version of that I will listen to now are the live versions recorded for the album / concert video with Floor singing.  Fucking amazing.


I've seen Kamelot three times, I believe all were with Tommy singing.   I was just never much of a fan and was always there for other bands.   After the third show they finally started to grow to me, so a few of their songs are on my rotation now.   The performance is great, I just didn't know the songs.
"
"Live Events (long-ish post with a few questions)","As someone else said, I think it must be something they do to try and cover the costs of a US tour, because those prices both seem really expensive to me.  We bought Epica VIP tickets for only £35 (about $55). Usually I only go to free signings or hang around by the tour bus to get a signature - I know that some bands e.g. Lacuna Coil will still happily sign for fans afterwards even if they sell a VIP package. But it's up to you, if this is your only chance to get your stuff signed by Nightwish then I would say go for it.

I imagine the ""tour programme"" will just be something similar to what you get in a theatre, a booklet with lots of photos, bits about the tour dates and perhaps interviews with band members. 

As for the Epica tour, I'm sure it will be rescheduled, but probably not with Machine Head. MH have not contacted the band or apologised for cancelling the tour so Epica are very unhappy with them.  

Bonus question: I would say Floor and Tommy are both brilliant live while Simone is not as good (in my opinion) but improving - she had extra lessons to prepare for the Retrospect concert. You can get a good idea watching their DVDs or on YouTube."
"Live Events (long-ish post with a few questions)","Would make sense. As someone said below, their shows are often not even close to being sold out at most US places, so they basically HAVE to tack on heavy ticket prices for VIP stuff to make up for it.

"Jari from Wintersun explains the problems delaying Time II (x-post from r/metal and r/epicmetal)","&gt;They actually told me point blank that I should just stop making music and they will never release Wintersun from the contract  

This really pisses me off. It all comes down to money with these record companies and they don't care about their artists. That's why bands like Protest the Hero become independent and they get to keep a lot of their revenue. Unfortunately, it looks like Nuclear Blast doesn't want that to happen and would rather shut down an artist. All because they would lose some money. I hope I'm wrong, but it wouldn't surprise me if Time II is never released.

My question is what bands with a more Epica/Nightwish/Within Temptation feel to it (female vocals, less black metal) that still have a good amount of blast beats in it?

I may be shrinking the options with the specificity of it, but I really do miss them since discovering and becoming obsessed with this genre.

"Nightwish Live?","I asked about various bands and their live performance qualities a few months back...long story short I'm likely going to pass on the Kamelot show, and go for the Nightwish one, with VIP. Apologies for a lot of questions in this one post, but I want to know what I'm doing before I spend this much money...

That being said, how has Nightwish's live performances been so far on the current tour? I'm sure it varies from night to night, but as far as live goes, I've only seen their DVDs, which, I'd imagine, is probably edited a bit to make it sound better. That could be false, but idk. If they actually sound as good as they do on the DVDs, then I'm insanely excited.

Additionally, what exactly do the VIP tickets for the Nightwish shows include? Enterthevault says ""includes pre show meet and greet, poster and tour program"". Tickets are $180 which is *really* pushing it, but I think it's worth it. How personalized, if much at all, is the meet and greet? Is it just walk up get a signature and leave, or do you actually get to talk briefly? I'd love more than anything to be in the presence of Marco/Tuomas/Floor, or even have them sing a note or two out loud. And what does ""tour program"" refer to?"
"Nightwish Live?","&gt; how has Nightwish's live performances been so far on the current tour

The tour hasn't started yet. Once it does, though, you'll see more than your fair share of YouTube videos from the concerts, so you can just check those out to get a feel. If you don't want to spoil the setlist for yourself, I'm sure you can ask here once the tour starts and get some help from us.

&gt; what exactly do the VIP tickets for the Nightwish shows include

I got a similar VIP ticket for the Sonata Arctica show a couple months ago, and the poster we were given was about the size of an adult male torso. Everyone got that poster signed, as well as any CD's of theirs that they brought with themselves. The way the meet-and-greet worked for us was the band was sat behind a table and all the VIPs approached the other side of the table, handed over anything they want signed, and talked to the members for about as long as it took for them to sign what you had (usually no more than 30 seconds). After they all signed everything you had, you could get your picture taken with them, but you had to stay on your side of the table. It might be only worth the $180 if you're a diehard NW fan who *has* to be front-row, but for Sonata Arctica it was only $75, so I can't complain too much. Nightwish might have a general meet-and-greet format where everyone is in a room together and the band are roaming around freely, but it's too hard to say which it'll be.

I'm not entirely sure what the tour program is, but if I had to guess, I'd say it's a small booklet with all the tour dates listed on the book, as well as multiple pictures of the band throughout it. I think it's more of a collector's item than anything else, really."
"Nightwish Live?","&gt; It might only be worth the $180 if you're a diehard NW fan who *has* to be front-row

That's where I hesitate - I love NW to death, without a doubt. The chance to meet the members (any of them, really) even if briefly is awesome. But, I'm kinda cheap, and $180 is a large price to put onto my love for the band...I've heard NW in the past is pretty friendly overall and down to earth, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was the more generic walk-around form. That's what I'd prefer, definitely.

Do NW show tickets usually sell out in most places in NA? Idk if I should try to decide sooner or maybe wait for the tour to begin to get more feedback first."
"Nightwish Live?","I paid VIP for Nightwish once (it was only 80$ back then) and honestly it wasn't really worth it to me. I got a signed poster but they were very formal and you didn't really get to speak to them."
"Nightwish Live?","This was my experience too with the VIP tickets. I'm not even sure seeing the band from the front row is that ideal, either, because tons of people will try to push their way to the front and you'll spend half the concert fighting them off... I was in the 2nd row and it got annoying halfway through the concert... Very distracting. The first few shows I went to, no VIP, maybe they were lesser known at the time, because I was able to get close to the front right away regardless."
"Nightwish Live?","Watch the Live at Wakken 2013 video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9eKLPCciWw"
"Nightwish Live?","Based on the many emails EntertheVault has been sending me, a lot of the VIP tickets have already been sold out, so better decide soon (or maybe it's too late anyway)."
"Nightwish Live?","This was quite helpful. Thanks!"
"Nightwish Live?","I can't speak on the meet &amp; greet (I also bought VIP tickets but this is the first time I've done something like this), but I did see Nightwish live, but with Annette instead of Floor when they were in Minneapolis a few years ago right after the release of Dark Passion Play.

They were AMAZING. If anything, the DVDs and films of their live performances don't even come close to doing the actual performance justice.

I don't know if you go to a lot of concerts, but one thing that really affects me, personally, when I go to a live show is the crowd itself. That electric, overwhelming ENERGY that just flows through everybody in the venue. THAT is what makes a live show so much better than watching a video online, or listening to a studio album.

It's the difference between seeing a movie at home, by yourself, versus seeing it opening night in the theater with 200 other people."
"Nightwish Live?","I've only been to one concert in the past and it was a guitarist (Joe Satriani) and we kinda just sat in the seat and listened. Wasn't anything like a metal concert is like, I'd imagine.

That is, however, what I prefer - being there is already the fun of it. I don't see the need to be in the giant huddled up crowd of people, personally - I'd rather stay back and just listen."
"Nightwish Live?","Metal concerts are a BIT more intense. :)

That being said, the venue where I saw Nightwish last time had seating in a sort of balcony area. I sat up there with my friends, drank beer and cheered and listened, and watched the crazy mosh pit below me.

What amused me to no end was how people would go from crazy headbanging mosh-pit style action, to swaying side to side on the slower/more emotional parts of Nightwish's songs. And then right back to insane headbanging.

It was a crazy contrast and a lot of fun to watch.

Moshing isn't my thing either, but it IS fun to watch and the energy is infectious. I recommend looking for a balcony or similar at your venue when you go.

I'm going to the one in Clive, IA, you?"
"Nightwish Live?","Worcester, MA - I don't think bands like NW usually sell out here but I'm sure VIP tickets are pretty limited at this point, so I'm trying to decide sooner than later...$180 is a lot of money, even though I do love the band.

Might be able to get my parents to pay half of it as a birthday gift though, since the show is within 2 weeks of my birthday this year :D"
"Nightwish Live?","Cool stuff, you'll enjoy it either way I'm sure. Nightwish puts on a good show. And the supporting bands on this tour (Sabaton and Delain) are really good too."
"Nightwish Live?","I know next to nothing about Sabaton - what are they like?

As for Delain, I've listened to (and loved many times over and over) Lucidity, and I got into April Rain for a bit, although April Rain was a bit too commercial-y sounding for me to *really* get into. Haven't tried anything past there, yet."
"Nightwish Live?","Don't go VIP. Just get general admission for both shows. Kamelot is fabulous live and you can't miss them."
"Nightwish Live?","This isn't taking travel expenses into account. "
"Nightwish Live?","They're both coming to Worcester (close enough to drive to, even though it's a bit of a drive) within a month or two of each other, so that's definitely doable. 

NW &gt; KM in terms of priority for me this year, but if I can manage to afford both so close together, I definitely want to."
"Nightwish Live?","I saw Nightwish with Floor in Orlando back in 2013 and I was absolutely blown away. I expect nothing less from this tour. "
"Nightwish Live?","I would not waste the money on VIP. I did VIP on their last tour and it was the most disorganized mess I've ever seen... and I usually always do VIP....

they let some of us buy merch before meeting them, then cut the rest off. the line was absolutely insane. they really barely talked to anyone (Anette was really the only one who seemed genuinely nice tbh). 

and for 200 bucks this time? no thanks. I'll use that money to go see Kamelot and the inevitable Blind Guardian tour as well."
"Nightwish Live?","I have seen Nightwish twice but I have never done the VIP thing although one of my best friends has and she enjoyed it but she is more of super crazed fan.  I'd love to do it but not for the price they are asking on this upcoming tour.  As far as the concerts themselves, I saw one show with Annette which was pretty good but I wouldn't call it great mainly because she never had the stage presence of Tarja.  The second show I saw was the infamous Denver show on the last tour where everything went to shit for them because that was the night that Annette was sick and the girls from Kamelot had to fill in on at least a few of the songs and the rest was pretty much crowd karaoke.  That show, especially given the circumstances was awesome and I can be seen in the front row in the documentary!  I have seen Floor with her other band, ReVamp and even though I'm not a ReVamp fan, she was great.  So, I'm sure combining her with Nightwish will make for an incredible show."
"Nightwish Live?","I saw Nightwish on their last tour in Worcester MA. Definitely one of the best concerts I've been to. I did the VIP and bought tickets for me and my girlfriend, and we're doing the same for this tour as well. Thomas see me a bit on edge, but that was shortly before Annette left. Other than that, they were very nice, and talked to everyone rather than ignoring them. My only real complaint is that the signed poster was small and looked like it had been thrown together last minute. I feel that's the fault of the venue, not the band. "
"Nightwish Live?","I think Tuomas seems like the type of person who wouldn't be a big fan of mass meet-and-greets with people who love him but have never met him...I know I would be &gt;.&lt;

Sounds good though, I don't care much for the poster/program thing, the meet-and-greet is where the fun would be for me."
"Nightwish Live?","Yeah. He isn't really much of a people person. Jukka was very outgoing, he had a small conversation with my girlfriend about her shirt, and I shook Marcos hand. 
All I really care about the poster is that I have Annette's autograph along with everyone's. 
Definitely go for it though. Its expensive, but worth it. "
"Nightwish Live?","I don't know much about Jukka or Emppu, but I wouldn't have thought that Jukka would be really outgoing - guess everyone can surprise you :)

I'll heavily consider it in the next day or two, sounds like a lot of fun if they keep doing what they did when you went."
"Nightwish Live?","Either way, it will be a great concert. I noticed in a previous comment that you'll be going to the Palladium. It's a really great venue, for the main stage. A bit of advice for the future thiugh, make sure any concert you're going to is held in the main room. The upstairs room is way too small for some of the shows they hold there. Enjoy the concert though. I have high hopes for this tour. "
"Nightwish Live?","Kind of seconding what everyone else has said - the times I've seen Nightwish were the best concerts of my life. They put on an amazing show and you can't beat Floor for live vocals.

From what I've heard about the VIP it doesn't sound worth the money. I like to get signatures but it's never that great getting 2 seconds with a band sat at a table. I was amazingly lucky and got to meet them with the fan club when they were really chilled and could talk to people - maybe you could join the US fan club just in case they have an opportunity like that?

Epica's VIP sounded a lot better since it was only £30 and you got a bunch of free stuff and a photo with the band, but we got stuck in traffic and missed it! :'( so if you do get VIP, make sure you get there really early..."
"Nightwish Live?","As it stands now after seeing the comments here, I believe I'm going to take the chance and hope that the VIP is more than just a few seconds with them (I'm likely going to have my parents cover half the price of the VIP ticket as a birthday gift since it's a week or two away from my birthday).

Worst case scenario (meet and greet not being too special), I still get to see them up close, and get to see the show regardless, and look into it for the next tour. Best case scenario, I don't even have to worry :D
"
"Nightwish Live?","It's just a meet and greet. Shake hands, take photo, get something signed and then stay in the first row (which is how it used to be handled and the actual reason people buy VIP)."
"Nightwish Live?","Going off of past experiences of VIP shows, this one seems to be standard. Being EntertheVault.com, they usually give a tour poster, early access to meet the band, take a photo with them and allow you to interact/have them sign your merch (including the poster you just got) Depending on how many people are going VIP, this will determine if it's a quick 30-60 seconds with the band, or 5-10 minutes. Seeing how Nightwish is not a band that does this often, I see the former.

Tour program sounds like it's a tour only piece of merch that has tour dates and other little tidbits of info/pictures others won't be able to get.

Although $180 for VIP? That's going too far (price wise) IMO. I've seen Iced Earth 3 times VIP and I think it may be just over that price with all of them put together. But if you're a diehard fan, power to you."
"Nightwish Live?","Main reason I question doing it is, as said in a few other comments, I'll have most of the ticket price covered by my parents basically as my birthday gift for the year - even then it's still kinda pushy, but I understand (to a certain extent) why it'd be a bit more pricey than others, since they're a huge musical entity worldwide."
"Nightwish Live?","I've seen them live 7 times in 3 countries and I'm flying over to the U.S. For the start of the tour in April. They are incredible live. The VIP ticket price for the U.S. Is a money making exercise by the promoter pure and simple. It's daylight robbery "

"Tuomas Holopainen - A Lifetime of Adventure [High Quality]","The official video and the single are released on the 7th, I believe. I've watched it on the app, it looks great but sadly they aren't able to have any Scrooge McDuck animation or anything since they're not working with Disney. But instead there's stylized shots of Johanna singing and some other pretty stuff (northern lights, chests of gold) and it shows Don Rosa drawing the picture for the cover art. It works well, I think!"
"Tuomas Holopainen - A Lifetime of Adventure [High Quality]","I love how neither artist - Don nor Mr.Holopainen - compromised on their signature style, yet their works still fit together quite snuggly.

Incidentally, Oceanborn was the album that got Simone Simons into symphonic metal too!"

"Great Online Radio Stations?","I really like The Escapist radio which is run by the mods from Tuomas Holopainen's official site. If you keep an eye on their schedule,  they've occasionally had symphonic metal nights, but in general they play quite a lot of the genre anyway (and a lot of Nightwish of course)! Also you could try things like Last.fm radio if you're just looking to try new bands that are similar to your taste."
"Great Online Radio Stations?","Funnily enough, the reason I'm looking for radio streams is for Euro Truck Simulator 2 game. It already has tons of european radio stations built in, but you can add additional radio stations to listen to while you drive. I know it's silly, but it's fun."

So here is my list so far. The format is ""band name - album title (if known) - release date (if known) - recording status/any other notes"". I've marked out things that are related projects or similar genres with a (+) sign.

"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","The next Nightwish album will be the first studio album with Floor. It won't be released until 2015 IIRC. Can't wait. 

Showtime, Storytime was already the best album of this year imo."
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","Indeed, Floor is in the states this summer, for a tour with Revamp."
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","they always record all of the music first then have the vocals come in last. Usually during the ""demo"" phase marco sings everything, they don't need floor until its time to record her vocals. 

"
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","So was Showtime, Storytime a live album with Floor singing?"
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","Yes, and it is amazing!"
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","Blind Guardian will probably be releasing their new album this fall. Although primarily Power Metal, I heard the band will be using an orchestra to create songs like 'Sacred Worlds' and 'Wheel of Time' from their last album. "
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","That album is going to be absolutely epic "
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","They've been working on a purely orchestral album since the late 90s, which will hopefully finally come out this year. Wheel of Time was actually originally composed for the orchestral project, but I guess it didn't fit with the rest of the material, so they turned it into the song on At the Edge of Time instead. I'm pretty sure they're planning to release a new regular album in addition to the orchestral one. I'm unreasonably excited for both! "
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","We'll count them :) added!"
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","Anaria is an up and coming symphonic metal band from the states about to release their debut album. Their first music video comes out Jan 3rd"

"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","Thanks for making this list. Looks like a lot of awesome stuff coming out."
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","System Divide's ""Cult of Indifference"" is one I'm really looking forward to after a couple of delays (Summer-Fall 2014, unconfirmed as they took down the original posting of their planned date). They're adding orchestrations to their style, and it sounds really brutal in my opinion.

To the unfamiliar, System Divide is extreme/technical death metal with gothic influences. I think. 

Here's their single off the album:

"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","Cheers, added! I didn't know they were adding symphonic elements, that's interesting."
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","Can you move the System Divide from the already released column? I was excited, went looking for the album and instead found it was never released and they're on indefinite hiatus now. 
Unless it was released as a demo or something. Otherwise it's nowhere to be found. "
"Upcoming Symphonic Metal Albums in 2014","Apologies, I had no idea. When I last checked I saw it was down for a March release date, now I've just seen on their page that they're on hiatus - they were due to play my nearest city, turns out the promoters didn't tell anyone they'd pulled out so I missed that too. I'll put it back into upcoming with a note about the hiatus."

"New Within Temptation single ""Paradise (What About Us?)"" to Feature Tarja Turunen","Thanks for linking this! I already feel better about what I said above that Tarja's voice might be overpowering, it seems they've put her lower in the mix so we get more of Sharon and it works well.

Edit: Lol, the top comment is now someone complaining that Tarja's voice is too quiet. Typical!"
"New Within Temptation single ""Paradise (What About Us?)"" to Feature Tarja Turunen","Talk about random and unexpected, but yay!!"
"New Within Temptation single ""Paradise (What About Us?)"" to Feature Tarja Turunen","I have reservations, but mostly I'm just really excited to hear it! Within Temptation are my favourite band, and I loved Tarja's work with Nightwish. I can't wait! "

"New Within Temptation single ""Paradise (What About Us?)"" to Feature Tarja Turunen","At the moment I don't like the idea at all. Because Tarja's voice is overpowering and I feel like it would clash with Sharon's voice instead of contrasting. And because I'm dreading the amount of drama that Tarja brings with her (as someone who once got hate mail for giving her album 6/10). I've got this (fairly pessimistic) view that anything WT related is now going to be full of comments about either Tarja being better than Sharon or saying Tarja and Sharon should team up and beat up Tuomas... or that Within Temptation are the new Nightwish or... you can tell I've spent too much time reading this kind of stuff, right? :P

This is just my immediate knee-jerk reaction though. I am fully prepared to be proved wrong and I hope I actually love their voices in the song and everyone is nice about it.

Edit: Already feeling more postive after the clip that Harkaen linked, it sounds really good at least, now only the drama to worry about it! "
"New Within Temptation single ""Paradise (What About Us?)"" to Feature Tarja Turunen","The Tarjaholics, as my dad and I call them, are just awful. She isn't gods gift to singing they make her out to be. Compared to other classicly trained operatic singers, she is only average, and without the right music to back her up, she isn't that good at all. With Nightwish, she had unique and powerful music composed by Tuomas and that is what made her and yet these people think she was the power in the band. Bye Bye Beautiful's lyrics really says it all. Did the Tarja fans listen to the music or the the actual words he wrote? Or were they just enchanted by the pretty girl.

Wondering if I will get hate mail now. -_-"

"HMELU - undergrad students and the study of METAL","So glad you guys got to bring this to fruition! Only have time for the first song so far, but it sounds amazing!

"Sins Of Thy Beloved - Silent Pain","I really like their [Perpetual Desolation Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN0nbxFQPxY) show. As for the awesome violin, you probably already know that Pete Johansen went on to play with Tristania - which is part of the reason why the earlier Tristania albums are so much better than their later ones."
"Sins Of Thy Beloved - Silent Pain","Yeah I love watching that video but the quality isn't that great. Yeah I already knew that, although I dont listen much to Tristania nowadays like I used to.

At least we have SAVN now but it feels more like Midnattsol and less than TSOTB."

"The History of Symphonic Metal (blog article)","Thank you very much, it's really lovely to hear that."
"The History of Symphonic Metal (blog article)","That was an interesting read, thank you for writing this! When I think about categorizing the history of symphonic metal I make similar divisions to yours. The mid-90's where Therion and Theatre of Tragedy shape the genre followed by the late-90's where Nightwish and Within Temptation take it to international commercial success. I was in the early years of high school when *Oceanborn* and *Mother Earth* came out. I've been hooked ever since! 

There's a minor thing I disagree with in your description of *Therion's* Theli:

&gt;This marked a turning point for the band (who had previously only played death metal) 

I would argue two of their earlier albums *Lepaca Kliffoth* and *Symphony Masses: Ho Drakon Ho Megas* are steps towards symphonic metal. Even if you'd classify *Theli* as the first true symphonic metal album (which I could agree with), it's still incorrect to describe these two as death metal.

And a small typo:

&gt;Nightwish's main main Tuomas Holopainen

""main main"" --&gt; ""main man"""
"The History of Symphonic Metal (blog article)","Aha, good point, I think I will edit that accordingly to try and make it clearer that their sound evolved over time rather than going from death metal to symphonic. Thanks! And good spot on the typo.

Many thanks for reading, really glad to get feedback from people."
"The History of Symphonic Metal (blog article)","Thanks for the good read. I got into symphonic metal back when Nightwish released Once, and after that I became totally hooked. I found a few names I wasn't familiar with in the article, which I am now going to have to go investigate :)"

"Therion to Headline MFVF [BE] (also announced - Jaded Star and La-Ventura)","Why cant we have a concert like this in US?"
"Therion to Headline MFVF [BE] (also announced - Jaded Star and La-Ventura)","There certainly used to be one or two festivals in the USA that did exclusively metal with female singers, but I haven't heard anything about them recently and I think they might have stopped. 

Though you guys do have a couple of festivals that have a lot of symphonic metal bands that I've noticed, like [ProgPower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProgPower_USA) and the [70000 Tons of Metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70000_Tons_of_Metal) cruise. But of course it's a massive country so I guess it's difficult for people to get to any that aren't nearby."
"Therion to Headline MFVF [BE] (also announced - Jaded Star and La-Ventura)","Wow! Blind Guardian, Therion, Apocalyptica, and Arch Enemy are doing 70000 Tons of Metal next year, and there's still over 40 bands to be announced. I really hope I can make it to that!

Edit: Nevermind :( No way can I afford a $1400 ticket + plane ticket to get to Florida..."
"Therion to Headline MFVF [BE] (also announced - Jaded Star and La-Ventura)","Would probably be cheaper to go to a European festival! Their ticket prices are cheaper at least - even a VIP ticket to Metal Female Voices Fest is only 120€ (about $165). But I guess 70000 Tons is basically a full week cruise holiday as well as a festival, so it's bound to be very expensive."
"Therion to Headline MFVF [BE] (also announced - Jaded Star and La-Ventura)","Yeah, that's a very good point! "
"Therion to Headline MFVF [BE] (also announced - Jaded Star and La-Ventura)","Don't know why they want to have the cruise in the middle of fucking winter...

I'd love to go to MFVF or Wacken or such but you know, english, and me being a little scaredy cat."
"Therion to Headline MFVF [BE] (also announced - Jaded Star and La-Ventura)","Haha, well, the cruise goes to the Carribean, and it'll be really warm there at that time of year - website I just looked at said it's about 22° C which is more than warm enough, especially for a bunch of metalheads in black t-shirts :P "
"Therion to Headline MFVF [BE] (also announced - Jaded Star and La-Ventura)","MFVF have just said they need to wait until after [this festival](http://www.durbuyrock.be/) to announce one of the bands - seems likely it would be Arkona looking at that list? And that also they should be able to announce the full line-up in April.

They've also said that Epica aren't available this year, and neither are Nightwish, Within Temptation, Arch Enemy and Doro which is pretty disappointing. I'm hoping for some of the ias myself... as in Xandria, Sirenia, Tristania..."
"Quantum Enigma problem","I recently discovered symphonic metal by hearing an Epica song from Quantum Enigma. So I picked up the album and it was amazing. I love it, it's the best album of anything I've ever heard.

Naturally,  I began my search for other bands and even older Epica albums to find more stuff I like, but there is nothing that compares. I was completely spoiled by the awesomeness of Quantum Enigma. Their other albums like The Phantom Agony and Design Your Universe are OK but not as good.  I  can't even really get into other symphonic metal bands."
"Quantum Enigma problem","My personal favorite album of theirs is The Divine Conspiracy.  Take that album for a spin."
"Quantum Enigma problem","As a whole album it has parts I like, but it's got a lot of slow bit s. slow bits are ok, but to me it feels like it doesn't necessarily ""diminish"" the heaviness of the album, but make heavier parts seem unecessary.

Buts 

In other words, I feel like it doesn't fit together.

There are definitely songs I like individually. "
"Quantum Enigma problem","I found if I listened to the album by starting with the final track then going back to the beginning, it seemed to flow better - less interrupted. But that's just me. It took me ages before I would even listen to the slow songs like Safeguard to Paradise etc. Just skipped them."
"Quantum Enigma problem","Maybe it will grow on me."
"Quantum Enigma problem","I know how you feel. I thought Epica's earlier stuff was pretty average compared to the later albums at first, but after several listens of Divine Conspiracy, it became a favourite. TQE is still #1 in my books, but TDC has something else that I really love and always go back to."

"Quantum Enigma problem","I can see why you'd feel like that, it's a very high quality album and there's not really anything quite like it. But there are things to love about other bands/albums too. I love Nightwish's lyrics and beautiful compositions, I love Sharon's voice in Within Temptation, I love how Leaves' Eyes evoke scenes of ancient Norse history.

I remember when I first got into the genre it was with WT's The Heart of Everything and Nightwish's Dark Passion Play. No other albums compared to those at the time for me. But eventually I saw what was great about the old stuff, and of course there were new albums that surprised me too. I think this genre is full of wonders if you stick around and explore!"
"Quantum Enigma problem","It sounds like you need some time to adjust. Don't sweat it if you can't jump right into the genre pool. Take it a little at a time. 

Welcome to the symphonic metal family."
"Quantum Enigma problem","Haha, thanks. We'll see if it grows on me."

Wintersun - ""Sons of Winter and Stars"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMbFu457jGs

Edenbridge - ""Alight a New Tomorrow"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZi4cDjHTo8

Each one varies in style. Each band has their own unique formula that's quite distinguishable. If you need any more suggestions, ask around. We don't bite -too- hard.

"
"Quantum Enigma problem","The Nightwish song is good, the next two were too ""heavy"" too much drums and screaming. and the last one feels kinda pop song-ey. Thanks for the recommendations. "
"Quantum Enigma problem","No prob. Glad you found somethin ya like."
"Quantum Enigma problem","Usually takes me some time to adjust to new music. I don't really feel like I can appreciate the full force of a song until I've listened to it several times over. With the exception of a few songs of course.

Try out Requiem For the Indifferent if you haven't as well."
"Quantum Enigma problem","Just recently listened to that one. I must have missed it earlier. I read some people didn't like that one here but I thought it was pretty good. The thing with other Epica albums is they have some songs I like and some I really don't, but on Quantum Enigma I like every song. I also find that Requiem For the Indifferent has fewer songs I dislike than the previously mentioned two albums."
"Quantum Enigma problem","Yea song style varies in each album. They have some soft songs, some instrumentals, some heavy songs etc. I've heard that people don't like Requiem for the Indifferent, but I liked it.

Also check out After Forever, they're disbanded now, but they were good back then.

Amberian Dawn is also pretty decent. I liked their stuff with Heidi more though. Their new singer has a totally different style that I don't like.

Just two other band suggestions; I don't know if you've tried them though."
"Quantum Enigma problem","I would highly recommend After Forever's [self titled album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aW9Am0QRKI) to you! In my opinion, it is on the same level as the Quantum Enigma (it was actually my definitive favorite symphonic metal album before TQE came out). "
"Quantum Enigma problem","I don't think I like this one.  I didn't really like the songs until De-energized and then the weird tech solo thing put me off. Maybe some single songs are listinable. "
"Quantum Enigma problem","I would try Neverworld's End by Xandria.  Although it isn't as tight of an album as Quantum Enigma, I think it is a very strong, and frequently overlooked album."
"Quantum Enigma problem","I liked this one a lot. It all feels like it belongs together and is a good album. It feels a little repetitive and the songs sound maybe too similar to eachother. Might download this one."
"Quantum Enigma problem","Try The Silent Force, The Heart of Everything or The Unforgiving by Within Temptation. Those are slightly different style-wise from Epica, but no less awesome.

I can definitely empathize with your situation though - I haven't been listening to many other albums since I first found The Quantum Enigma. Reverence is a particular favorite of mine."
"Quantum Enigma problem","I love that one. Second stone too all of the songs so good"
"Quantum Enigma problem","*As time goes by, I hide the truth,*
*cannot stand myself with a broken shelllll*
"
"Quantum Enigma problem","Lol are those the lyrics? I've literally never listened to the lyrics of a song.  I like the singing but for me you may as well just go La la la. "
"Quantum Enigma problem","Yeah, the chorus part!

To each their own, I suppose."
"Quantum Enigma problem","The first two After Forever albums are basiclaly proto epica seeing that Mark Jansen was the driving force in those albums. 

You should look into those also."
"Quantum Enigma problem","Try listening to Design Your Universe and Requiem for the Indifferent more. Those albums aren't as consistently great as TQE, but they have some masterpieces in them (Kingdom of Heaven, the title tracks, and Serenade of Self-Destruction come to mind).

Also, try listening to After Forever (mainly Decipher, Invisible Circles and the self-titled album), as well as Sirenia (At Sixes and Sevens, and Perils of the Deep Blue are amazing albums).

You may also like/love the latest 3 Nightwish albums, the latest 4 Kamelot albums and the latest 4 Within Temptation albums.

There's a lot to explore in symphonic metal! You got ""spoiled"" by TQE (which is an excellent album and extremely hard to top), but there's a lot of amazing symphonic metal in other albums/bands too.

Have fun =)"
"Quantum Enigma problem","well lets come at the problem from a different direction.  What do you, or did you, currently listen to and love? pop? metal? screamcore? nu-wave stuff? 

There's a lot of smaller bands that cross over so if we know what you liked, we can perhaps offer something more than the big 5 or 7 bands that everyone throws in."
"Quantum Enigma problem","I go through phases where I don't even like music. I mainly listened to Ozzy Osborne and Avenged Sevenfold. Some Metallica and a few songs here in there from other rock/metal bands. Also I sometimes just go to last.fm and play random classical music."
"Quantum Enigma problem","you sound a little like me. someone who likes a guitar sound with a bit of strings and melodic voice thrown in. I would suggest you try,

[The murder of my sweet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUwo2MaNDrk), two albums so far but they sound like they could grow into something good.
[Lacuna coil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB9LXpO6yWo) have some great songs and have been going long enough to be established. [Xandria's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGTAmmTiD_Y) latest is definitely worth checking out but their latest album is very different to their first three or four so I wouldn't go back unless you want something  a bit different. [Delain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubi1m5pR3hM) have some good songs worth listening to, although for me they are one of those bands who can't seem to do a consistent album.  Finally, and going out on a limb, if you fancy something a bit different try [amaranthe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y25snz83ms), a bit poppy but very high energy.

"
"Quantum Enigma problem","Amaranthe was sort of my gateway between Avenged Sevenfold and symphonic metal, wasn't really into female singers before. Great suggestions."
"Quantum Enigma problem","I have listened to ALL of Epica's studio albums so many times I can't count and sing and growl along with them. I can see why you may be having problems as the Quantum Enigma is very unique. The mixing/mastering was the best in any of their albums. Did you know about the bonus tracks? I actually think some of these are better than most of the album songs.

Personally, Requiem for the Indifferent is my favorite of all their albums, but it took a while to grow on me. I think all of their music is kind of like that. If you hear TQE first, you may not like ""classic"" Epica as much, as TQE was really a huge deviation from their earlier style. The same instrumentation, singers and genre, but that's about where the similarities stop.

"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","one cannot simply have an opinion on symphony x without listening to the divine wings of tragedy and the odyssey.. "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","The song didn't make sense until I got to the last few minutes and I was like... HECK YEAH! "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","To be fair, Symphony X is more progressive/neoclassical metal than they are symphonic metal"
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Diabulus In Musica, Sirenia and Leaves' Eyes. They all sound like they have potential, but there's always something that I can't put my finger on that sounds off. I'd hesitantly add Kamelot to this list as well, but I've not really given them enough of a listening to."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","I really like Sirenia, but the band can be very different from one album to the other (they changed singer a lot). Maybe try a few songs from a few different albums! My favorite album of theirs is An Elixir for Existence."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Sirenia's got a strange sound because, while their music is very heavy (for a symphonic gothic band), they have this almost poppy melodic sound to their songs as well. I couldn't get into An Elixir for Existence, but Perils of the Deep sounds pretty good so far."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","See, I started off the same. Sometimes it's just not the right time. I immediately got into Leaves' Eyes when I found out they were talking about Vikings and all the fun stuff, and my first song by them was Ankomst which randomly played on pandora for me.
Sirenia took a bit longer since it's really poppy with Ailyn, but she's come a long way. The Perils of the Deep Blue is an excellent album though- I bought it on a whim and fell in love with it. Ailyn can sing really beautifully and she's been working to get to where she is now. Their sound has changed a bit. Old work by them is still pretty good.
Diabulus In Musica... I needed to come back to them. They took a while. I hesitantly got into them too, but Blazing a Trail really hooked me. Argia--their latest album is pretty good and has a nice balance between an airy feel and heavy metal.
Whatever it is, don't force yourself into the music. In my case, I always found a second listen several years later works."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","St. Micheal's Nightmare and Ex Nihilo got me into DIM... I like Argia and it's mastered very well... "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Definitely Within Temptation for me, too. "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","I agree. I can understand that a lot of people like them, and it's not that it's bad music; it just doesn't appeal to me. I've listened to everything they've put out, and I can't tell you one song that stood out to me."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Ahhh but Kamelot! Black Halo and Epica drew me in, Ghost Opera didn't do quite as much but still held alot of feels.  Other albums, not so much.  

Other bands that took me awhile to get used to -- Opeth, Sonata Arctica (not sure how much those two qualify as symph metal though)"
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","The band I've always struggled to get into was Within Temptation, i always loved angels and ice queen but could never really manage to get into their other stuff. Can you guys suggest any songs similiar to those two?"
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Therion, with the sole exception of Secret of the Runes, I just can't seem to get into them.  I really like Secret of the Runes though.

Same thing for Within Temptation for me, while I don't mind their stuff, the only album I listen to by them consistently is The Unforgiving.  Everything else just doesn't resonate with me I guess."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Nightwish. During Tarja's time, that is.

I've listened to Ghost Love Score and Nemo. Doesn't impress me..."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Try songs from Nightwish's power metal phase: Wishmaster, Fantasmic, Crownless, Stargazers. 

In my opinion, Tarja's operatic vocals suit their earlier sound better - fast, glorious, anthem-like. When they slowed it down a bit in Ghost Love Score and Nemo, Nightwish became more goth and sulky, and they lost this 'uplifting effect' their songs had. You'll know what I mean once you hear Wishmaster. "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Just listened to all of them, and I found Wishmaster and Fantasmic a bit meh. Crownless was brilliant. Stargazers somewhere in between.

"
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Give Wanderlust a listen then. 

After that, listen to the band Pythia. I think you might like them more than Nightwish. "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Will do! And definitely hoping their new album (when it comes out) wins me over."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","I have yet to hear anything from them that I haven't liked. They are actually my favorite band."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","I am the same. I like some of it but it's definitely not my favorite. "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Tarja's voice is too operatic for my tastes, I think. Can certainly see why she's a great vocalist, but I prefer the voices of Sharon den Adel/Simone Simons/Charlotte Wessels over hers."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","I say give Siren a listen. It's probably their best one with Tarja--IMO--and just has a creepy feel to it that works."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Xandria/After Forever/Therion.

TBH I think it's more about just taking the time to listen to them enough. 

On the flip side I love Kamelot (pre poison) and a bunch of WT stuff."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","I've never been a fan of After Forever's early albums, but the self-titled one is by far the best, especially Dreamflight and Empty Memories where Floor can really show off her voice."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","I absolutely love Decipher. It was bit odd at first because of the 'ethnic' instruments and everything, but she's got some awesome high notes- Monolith of Doubt, My Pledge of Allegiance #1, Intrinsic.I also love the use of oboe on the album.

super excited to hear the new Nightwish album with Floor as lead."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","I lied. I actually enjoyed a few songs on their selftitled album. "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Therion is quite a difficult band to get into, especially if you've already listened to a lot of more recent symphonic metal. Unlike most bands, Therion don't usually go for the bombastic ""epic metal"" sound of bands like Nightwish, Epica, Rhapsody, Blind Guardian etc. and don't have the more accessible sound of bands like Delain and Within Temptation. Although I now consider Therion to be my favourite band, I hated every one of their albums on the first listen through. I'm not quite sure what it is that makes Therion's sound so appealing to me and it's difficult to recommend a starting point because their more ""accessible"" stuff (in Therion terms) is generally considered their worst and everything else is kinda weird. I think they're a band that you have to listen to whole albums at a time to appreciate their music to begin with as individual songs don't really give you a full idea of what they're like."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","To me it's more of a time thing. I haven't taken the time to actually listen to any Therion album through. Everytime a song will shuffle onto my ipod, I'll skip. I'll definitely try to make an effort in the near future. "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","The main problem with Therion in my opinion is their inconsistency. Some of their songs or even albums are really disappointing, while other songs and albums are masterpieces. "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Love Kamelot, too... except for Poison. Everything before, and Silverthorn (which is after), are awesome."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Don't know if you have listened to Xandria's latest, but before this new singer, I couldn't get into them. But with the new singer I absolutely love the new album."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","I actually hung out with Xandria and Delain after their show in Calgary. Went to a pub til like 3am lol. Dianne didn't come out tho. But yeah I like a few of their songs on their newer albums but haven't really taken the time to truly appreciate them. "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","I wanted to meet them after the Orlando show, but it was so cold in the venue and I have some spinal problems that get worse when cold, I was hurting too bad to hang around. I regret not getting to meet them. :( I was totally blown away by their performance. Never liked Xandria until that show."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","I agree. My order for favourite performance that night would be Xandria then Delain then Sonata Arctica "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Oh yeah, Xandria stole the show. After Nightfall my dad and I both looked at each other with jaws dropped. Yeah I go to concerts with my dad. Only person I know with the same music tastes as me. :p

I was disappointed in Delain though, but that is only because Charlotte's vocals don't project very well and they didn't have her mic turned up enough to compensate. Still enjoy seeing them live. Hoping to see her and Marco on stage together next year. :)"
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Epica's early albums. Their 3 or 4 most recent albums I like, but I don't care for their older stuff."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Delain. Liv Kristine's solo stuff. I can't get really into Theatre of Tragedy, but I love Leaves Eyes, WT, Revamp, AF."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Have you listened to Liv's latest album? It's pretty different to her previous ones."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","No I havent, i'll look into it."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Therion, Kamelot, Delain (excluding THC which is awesome). Also WT, but I think the problem there is that the music is too simple and not heavy enough... I like an isolated few Kamelot and Therion songs, but have found it hard to like the bands in their entirety. I think the Kamelot lyrics and singing style often get too whiny even though the singer is obviously good. Therion is just hard to get into period and I think a lot of people will agree on that! 

My favorites are Epica, After Forever, MaYaN, Nightwish, Diabulus in Musica, Dark Moor, and Symphony X (like about half of their stuff). "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Sirenia and Symphony X. I don't know why, my husband absolutely loves S-X, but I just can't get the two of them. ::shrug::"
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Epica. I like the orchestral half of The Classical Conspiracy, but I've never really been able to get into them. "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","I was wondering if anyone would mention Epica.

Have you tried The Quantum Enigma? "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","No, but I've heard good things about it. "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Totally give TQE a try. If not, well you tried and it's just not for you. We all have that one band."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Their album Consign to Oblivion hooked me... I couldn't understand DYU and RFTI until like the third or fourth listen... of course now I love those albums. "
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","Within Temptation and Leaves Eyes are the two big ones for me.

I started listening to WT when The Heart of Everything came out at a friend's recommendation and I was on the fence at best. Even their older stuff felt boring and I didn't get why everyone was into them. It didn't help that I was told to basically stay away from any of their material after The Heart of Everything, which I did after reading reviews that they were becoming more ""alt-rock"" than symphonic.

Leaves Eyes I purchased Njord and after a few listens, maybe 2 songs stuck with me. Wasn't keen on the growling (odd since I love After Forever and Epica) but this one didn't do it for me. None of their other material ever caught on with me either, so it became a ""not recommended"" band for me."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","In my description, I also forgot to include Delain in that list. Just can't get into them. They seem a bit bland to me."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","I was like that too, and I think some of their music is still. For some reason though, I just had to listen to more after hearing Where's The Blood. Some songs are definitely way better than others."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","lol i saw them live recently after not being able to get into the videos. It didn't help."
"Bands many people love, but you just can't get into?","A lot of the bands I thought I couldn't get into have actually become my all-time favourites! It took me ages to get into Nightwish, Epica, Leaves' Eyes... I think Within Temptation were one of the few bands I've instantly loved on first hearing.

These days, I struggle with Therion, Kamelot, Stream of Passion, and most After Forever - except their final album. There's quite a lot of the smaller symphonic metal bands that I also find it hard to love. I think my taste has been spoiled by bands with more experience and/or bigger budgets."

"New details on The Quantum Enigma","This is my reaction in a nutshell. ""A continuation of Kingdom of Heaven from DYU? Did I read that right?""

My hype for this album is over the moon right now."
"New details on The Quantum Enigma","Really?  I'm surprised people feel this way.  I love Epica, and I really enjoyed DYU, but Kingdom of Heaven is, in my opinion, easily the weakest track on that album.  I found that song to be overwrought, repetitive, boring and really just felt long for the sake of being long.  It's 14 minutes that frankly should have been 9 or 10.  And it's not the length itself that bothers me, it's that there are stretches of that length that simply go nowhere, and as a result just can't hold my attention.  


Don't get me wrong, I'm really looking forward to the new album.  I've been a fan for years and love the direction they're going - I'm sure it will be wonderful.  Just not a fan of that one song."
"New details on The Quantum Enigma","Welp, guess there's no choice but the get the 3-CD version..."
"New details on The Quantum Enigma","I really love those mediabook things. They look great on the shelf and don't break like the jewel cases always do. I hope I can get every album in that format from now on."
"New details on The Quantum Enigma","If only local stores stocked more than just the basic jewel case versions of releases. Ordering online adds so much more shipping and currency conversion fees that it ends up being nearly 50% more than buying it from a store, not to mention shipping time from Europe, which is longer than simply waiting out the difference in release dates for North America.

But I guess I'll make an exception for this one!"
"New details on The Quantum Enigma","I don't suppose ordering from Nuclear Blast USA is any better? My only experience of them was when I ordered their special edition of Imaginaerum, and it was good value even with shipping to the UK. But that was a one-off situation I guess."
"New details on The Quantum Enigma","I'm not sure - my last Epica order was from CM Distro before they stopped stocking them, and that was for Requiem. The CD price was nice, at $11, but the shipping was $6.40! Add the USD to CAD conversion on top of that and it's around $20 for just a regular single-disc jewel case. That wouldn't be so bad (since I got Leaves' Eyes' SotN from the local store for $19), but the shipping time meant it didn't get to me until a week or so after the NA release date. 

Still, not much of a choice!"

"Did anyone else attend MFVF?","I am curious to know if any of you guys also went to Metal Female Voices Fest and if you enjoyed it. I'm reviewing the festival and I like to include a bit of what other people thought - not just myself.

Personally my favourite bands of the weekend were Leaves' Eyes, Xandria, Draconian and Sirenia. I was also hugely impressed by Arkona who put on a passionate and energetic show despite their plane being delayed - they didn't even have time to get into their stage outfits!

So, if you were lucky enough to attend, tell me your experiences! Who did you enjoy most?"
"Did anyone else attend MFVF?","the chick from arkona is fucking rad"
"Did anyone else attend MFVF?","Agreed. So powerful at both growling and clean singing. And it was even more impressive that she gave such an epic performance after just arriving from a long haul flight."
"Did anyone else attend MFVF?","As someone who loves Draconian and sadly couldn't attend the festival, can you tell me how did Heike do? I've found two videos on youtube and she sounded nice. What are your impressions? Is she good enough to fill the hole created after Lisa's departure?"
"Did anyone else attend MFVF?","I'm sorry you couldn't attend! Honestly, I thought she sounded lovely. I think her voice is quite close to Lisa's although not exactly the same - so I think she's a great choice. 

She was apparently really ill with the flu just before the show and some people have been saying she sounded bad because of it, but I didn't particularly notice that. Perhaps it's more obvious on the recordings. But anyway, I wouldn't blame her for that, she clearly has a nice voice and I'm sure she won't have any problems when she's feeling better."
"Did anyone else attend MFVF?","Thank you for this response. I like her previous work and really hope she will fit in with the rest of the crew both vocally and on stage."

"Looking for symphonic metal blogs/podcasts/ezines","Do you have a female singer? If so you can get in touch with sites like Muses of Metal or Femme Metal Webzine who both cover new bands. I'm not so sure about ones that cover general symphonic metal - I run one myself but I had to choose to only cover the bigger bands since I'm the only writer. You could try searching for symphonic metal blogs and also have a look for Facebook groups and pages where you can post, there's a fair few of those."

&gt;Critics vary in terming Evanescence a [rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music) or [metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music) band, but most identify them as some form of gothic band: publications such as *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)*, *[Rough Guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_Guides)*, *[Rolling Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone)* and *[Blender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(magazine\))* have identified Evanescence as a [gothic metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_metal) act,     while other sources such as *[NME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME)*, *[MusicMight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MusicMight)*, *[IGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN)*, *[PopMatters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PopMatters)* and *[Spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(magazine\))* have termed them [gothic rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_rock).      They have been compared to a variety of bands from differing genres, such as [nu metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_metal)  ensembles like [P.O.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.O.D.) and [Linkin Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkin_Park),   gothic metal groups like [Lacuna Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacuna_Coil),  and [symphonic metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphonic_metal) acts like [Nightwish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwish) and [Within Temptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Within_Temptation).  David Browne of *Blender* offers an elaborate description of the band's music as ""goth Christian nü-metal with a twist of melancholic Enya.""  Adrien Begrand of Popmatters describes Evanescence as utilising ""nu-metal riffage"".  [Adrian Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Jackson_(musician\)) of [My Dying Bride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Dying_Bride) stated that he feels Evanescence is doing something similar to his own gothic metal group, only in a more commercial direction.  Other genres and influences used to describe the band's sound include [industrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_music),   [alternative metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_metal),  [progressive metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_metal),  [alternative rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock),  [hard rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock),  [electronica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronica),  [post-grunge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-grunge),  [chamber pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_pop),  and [heavy metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music).  The band's official website classed their musical genre simply as ""rock"".

&gt;Evanescence was originally promoted in Christian stores. Later, the band made it clear they did not want to be considered part of the [Christian rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_rock) genre, like fellow Wind-up Records artists [Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed_(band\)).  Terry Hemmings, CEO of Christian music distributor Provident, expressed puzzlement at the band's about-face, saying, ""They clearly understood the album would be sold in these [Christian music] channels.""  After many Christian stores began to remove the band's music from their shelves, Wind-up Records chairman Alan Meltzer then issued a press release in April 2003 requesting formally that they do this.  In 2006, Amy Lee told *Billboard* that she had opposed being identified as a ""Christian band"" from the beginning.

"Hey guys! There's something fun happening at /r/nightwish - Bracket Tournament for NW's best song!","I dunno, I actually prefer The Poet and the Pendulum as their best song. GLS comes in a very close second place.

Could be partially due to overplaying GLS (yes, it can happen to the best of songs...) but I put it more towards the songwritring. If you assume both songs are Tuomas speaking of Tarja, then Penulum is, to me, kind of a ""part 2"" to GLS. The analysis spirals from there, and I just view Pendulum as, personally, a better song."
"Hey guys! There's something fun happening at /r/nightwish - Bracket Tournament for NW's best song!","TPATP was my absolute favourite for a little while. It was only Floor's version of GLS that returned it to the top of my list. Her interpretation is just so good.

I'm not sure about the meanings, though. I mean, no-one knows for certain if GLS is about a specific person (even Floor said she has no idea what it's about). And TPATP is really centered on Tuomas and his thoughts of depression and suicide - though I guess it was the turmoil in the band that caused that."
"Hey guys! There's something fun happening at /r/nightwish - Bracket Tournament for NW's best song!","I've always viewed the entire album Once (GLS in particular) Tuomas's expression of frustration in one way or another. GLS being his declaration of giving up and wanting to get out of the situation with Tarja. And I've always seen TPATP as his apology to Tarja, notably because of the very last 4 lines.

I could literally spent close to the reddit maximum length of a comment explaining why I believe this to be true, but obviously it's open to anyone's interpretations. To assume all he wrote about was love and complaints about love for 5+ years nonstop is a stretch, even I admit."
"Hey guys! There's something fun happening at /r/nightwish - Bracket Tournament for NW's best song!","Haha, yeah, it's true that people will always interpret in different ways though! For me I've always believed that the end of the song is Tuomas's parents speaking to him, since the section's called Mother and Father and it opens with ""be still my son, you're home""."
"Hey guys! There's something fun happening at /r/nightwish - Bracket Tournament for NW's best song!","Hmm... Wonder how the heavier songs (e.g. Wish I had an Angel, End of All Hope, Kinslayer, 10th man down, etc.) will do. "

"Has Nightwish ever played with a live orchestra?",""
"Has Nightwish ever played with a live orchestra?","I don't think they have, when they do, I'll do anything to be at that show.  ANYTHING.  "
"Has Nightwish ever played with a live orchestra?","Any reason why they haven't?

For it to go this long without, I would imagine someone in the band doesn't want to, which is stupid because Within Temptation's Black Symphony is like the best thing to ever happen in music, I'm sure every Nightwish and Symphonic Metal fan would kill to see them with a live orchestra."
"Has Nightwish ever played with a live orchestra?","Tuomas's dream is to do a live orchestra concert in London (particularly the Royal Albert Hall), using the same orchestra that the band have worked with since Once. Since time and money have prevented them from doing that (e.g. for Imaginaerum they put everything into the movie instead) it hasn't been realised yet.

The other thing the band have said about it is that they now see it as something all the big bands in the genre have done, and they don't want to do it unless they can do it in an original way. Personally I'd be totally happy to just see them playing their songs with an orchestra and no additional gimmicks, but I can see why they'd say that."
"Has Nightwish ever played with a live orchestra?","I guess it's kinda hard to plan something like that when you keep losing singers. I know I'm exaggerating, but you have to think Tuomas' next goal is for an orchestral concert, especially with the success he had with his solo album. Anette was a bit of a diva to the NW guys, so maybe Floor's consistency will make it possible to do something a bit more extravagant."
"Has Nightwish ever played with a live orchestra?","Therion has changed vocalists a dozen times and still did a number of concerts with a full orchestra. Tarja is performing with choirs and orchestras in her solo career. It can't be the singers."
"Has Nightwish ever played with a live orchestra?","But the difference between Therion and Nightwish is that every time Nightwish has gotten a new singer (I know it's only twice, but bare with me), they've been drastically different from the previous singer. There's a huge adjustment period, and Anette was only just finding her place in the band when she left.

The very depressing truth could be that NW just can't afford it. From what I've seen, Tuomas is a very driven and determined perfectionist. He most likely wants to perform with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, have a full backing choir, rehearse with them extensively, record the show for a video release, choose a long setlist, and probably bring some guest musicians too. After just having spent a huge amount of money on a feature film, maybe they just can't afford it right now. "
"Has Nightwish ever played with a live orchestra?","anette never found her place live. She was often flat, and just not able to tour."
"Has Nightwish ever played with a live orchestra?","All the symphonic metal concerts I have been to are at places with stages that aren't big enough for an orchestra. I have only seen north american concerts though. They do take up quite a bit of room. Maybe if they became super popular and could get enough people to fill a larger place they might try to get the orchestra too. I highly doubt that's doable.

Also it would cost a lot more money to have so many more people and you would have to find enough musicians willing to go on tour.  "
"Has Nightwish ever played with a live orchestra?","It wouldn't be a tour, it would be a single show the same way Within Temptation or Metallica have done it."
"Has Nightwish ever played with a live orchestra?","Nightwish play huge venues in Europe - the Hartwall Arena where they've played in Finland holds 13,000 people. But Tuomas has said that he'd love to do an orchestra show in the Royal Albert Hall in London which holds more like 5000 people. As /u/screampuff said it would be a one-off show rather than a tour."

"Redditors of SM, do you have a band (any genre) that never made it that you think could have been big?","Hmm, well when I first heard [Whyzdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjX2a5ScEn8) I thought they would be huge - they're not doing badly but keep having singer troubles. Their original singer was replaced with Clementine Delauney who then left to join Serenity before their second album was finished. They then had to redo all the vocals with a new singer but she left too and now they're onto their 4th singer. It's held them back a lot but I hope they keep going."

So we'll see! Would be nice if they did come back."
"Redditors of SM, do you have a band (any genre) that never made it that you think could have been big?","She had her child in 2012, which is when they mentioned they had content for songs, the last action on their facebook was in January I think. It's not looking good."

&gt;__Luna Mortis__ is an [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) [heavy metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music) band based in [Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin), [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin).

&gt;The band was formed in late 2001 in [Monroe, Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe,_Wisconsin) as [The Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ottoman_Empire_(band\)).  In 2006, the band self-released their debut [studio album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_album), *[Way of the Blade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Way_of_the_Blade)*. In June 2007, Luna Mortis played the first [Flight of the Valkyries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Valkyries) female-fronted metal festival in St. Paul, MN under their original name, The Ottoman Empire. 

&gt;In 2008, the band self-released an [EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play), *[The Answer: Does Not Exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer:_Does_Not_Exist_EP)*. That same year, the band changed their name to Luna Mortis and signed a recording contract with [Century Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_Media_Records).   On February 10, 2009, the band released their debut for Century Media, *[The Absence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Absence_(Luna_Mortis_album\))*, which was recorded in 2008 at the Audio Hammer Studios and produced by [Jason Suecof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Suecof).

"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I've seen them get hated on a lot in the metal community and I actually like them. I know they're not really symphonic metal, but I couldn't think of a better place to post this."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Love em, catchy and poppy and heavy and I just don't know why but I love em"
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Catchy, poppy and heavy are the reasons why I love them."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Pretty good. I consider it some pop with metal influence (as opposed to the other way around). I listened to them pretty frequently for about a week. It's catchy and entertaining. I saw them open for Within Temptation and there is definitely some studio polish and their stage presence can improve (clean vocalist seemed bored and didn't know what to do when he wasn't singing), but that's not unexpected for a fairly young band.

[Here's someone else's video from the show I saw.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpr8PzaZmKw)

Ultimately, it comes down to what you like. My Spotify playlists are full of 'guilty pleasures'."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I was at that show!  I agree with you that the singers could do better on stage (aimless wandering is a bit distracting) but I was otherwise impressed that they sounded close enough to their album sound that the catchiness didn't get lost.  I was excited to hear both bands there that night and I'm glad they were able to provide a good opening."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Right on. Small world. I'm in Seattle and flew down to LA to catch the show. It was pretty good. We're getting screwed by Nightwish/Delain next year, but I'll probably catch the BC and/or Portland shows. "
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I listen to them quite frequently and they did a pretty good live show when I saw them a couple months ago."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Eh, they're fun, but not what I can really sit down and listen too"
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Not amazing, but damn if I don't love to dance to Electroheart. "
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Have to agree with this ^"
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I like them, with the rage voice. It balances out the pop-influences of the  lead singer vocals imo."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Maybe it's because I like pop music too but I really enjoy them. They're catchy and fun while being heavy and I enjoy that. I'm going to see them in March. 

I really like that they don't take themselves too seriously. It's a breath of fresh air in the metal genre."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Amaranthe are one of the bands that I pick and choose songs from. Some like Within Temptation or Delain have really solid albums with some songs that just rise above the rest. Amaranthe have some amazing songs that balance out the rest of the album it seems. Overall, I enjoy listening to them and look forward to hearing their future releases."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","They're fun as a kind of lighter (less dark and heavy sound/lyrics) band. I really enjoyed their live performance in Montreal, they had great energy and really seemed to be enjoying themselves, while delivering good quality.  
I find some of their songs a bit too catchy/pop for my taste, but several of theirs are pretty awesome!"
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I think they're a fun band with some talent but lacking in the songwriting department. Songs are catchy, but shockingly unmemorable.  
Elize has a really good voice with lots of range, but both the male vocalists are hilarious bad. Henrik is ok with his harsh vocals but they're very monotonous. Jake, who is advertised as the band's power metal vocalist, has an outstanding absence of any power behind his voice and sounds like he's struggling. 
"
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I like them. The contrast between light pop and heavy metal is interesting, fresh.

I personally like the heavier parts more, but then I feel that they wouldn't pack as much punch if it wasn't for the contrast. Take the pre-chorus of *Drop Dead Cynical* for one. (""I hope to thrill you that expectations rise"", etc.) That piece of lyrics was super strong precisely because it came right after the light stuff.

But yeah, I'm a fan."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I really enjoy them. I don't particularly find any meaning in their music, but it's still fun to listen to and always cheers me up. "
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I actually really love them. I saw them at the Graspop-site 2 years ago and thought hey that's the woman that sang on the Kamelot album and googled them. Loved them ever since. Their new album is quite great and I've got it signed! =D"
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I think you'll find some love for them in this sub. Haven't gotten into Amaranthe myself yet, and I wasn't too impressed by the couple of songs that I listened to. "
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","If they dropped the rage voice they'd be awesome. "
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Strong disagreement. They'd be too light without the growler. I don't want that. And if I did, I'd still have Within Temptation."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Agreed."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","They are cheesy and samey but i like them a lot. Call out my name is probably their best song. It's actually really fantastic "
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Call out my name is my favorite from them as well! Great track and the chorus is amazing."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I really love The Nexus and Burn With Me."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I love The Nexus, but don't really like Burn With Me. It's a good song, but I just don't enjoy it"
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I thought you meant the song by nightwish, momentarily. "
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","My discription could probably apply to the song, too. "
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Not one of my favorites, but I like them enough to listen on occasion. "
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I like them a lot."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","[alot](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSvMMvy6t105BXzxiCAemswjzz9HkDKQ99Kw7m3EX7HbQhMSAl7JialkHo)"
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I really like them.  They changed the growl man to someone else that sounds a lot cleaner. "
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I like them a lot, harsh vocals included. Bought their new album the day it came out. It's not quite as consistently good as the last 2 imo, but it does have some great songs.

"
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I think they're great! Saw them open for Within Temptation last month and it was fantastic. "
"Opinions on Amaranthe?"," One of my favourites actually!"
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Amaranthe, kinda like Nightwish, is whatever genre they want to be for a particular song. So here works as well as anywhere."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","They're odd, style-wise. But I love Massive Addictive (the entire album). And Henrik Englund's growls are fucking immense. I have no idea how he can belt it out so smoothly without getting a sore throat but props to him.

"
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Most of their songs I don't care for, but I do like Hunger. "
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I love them, one of my favorite bands.  That's probably because I like pop music too.  I love Jessie J and Dragonette as well as bands like Epica and Within Temptation."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","I saw them during Within Temptations latest tour. Before that, I only heard a couple of songs by them. Thought they were kind of poppy, not my thing. That pretty much changed after their performance. They're able to mix everything without being overwhelming, and the heavy growls contrast nicely weight Elyze's voice. Plus they have some sweet headbanging moves on stage. "
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","Their lyrics make me cringe, but I saw them open for WT and it wasn't bad since I was only paying attention to the music. I just have a hard time accepting them because I associate Symphonic Metal with deep, meaningful music like Nightwish or Epica. I would still prefer them over anything on the radio though."
"Opinions on Amaranthe?","The more I listen to them, the more I enjoy them. Olof is amazing at creating catchy hooks while keeping his metal roots intact. "

"What is the most original, atypical, symphonic metal song which nevertheless clearly belongs to the genre?","Symphonic metal is extremely diverse because symphonic elements can be added to pretty much every other genre of metal. We all love the operatic vocals, classical instruments, orchestral arrangements, dramatic choirs, and all the other characteristics that make this genre so amazing.

What songs use these elements in unique ways, or add something new to the mix to make for something very original yet still symphonic metal?

"
"What is the most original, atypical, symphonic metal song which nevertheless clearly belongs to the genre?","Try Diablo Swing Orchestra! IMO it definitely fits symphonic metal although they use quite a bit of jazz as well in their songs. It's an interesting mix! 

Balrog Boogie is a fun song to start with that has some clear jazzy sounds. "

"What is the most original, atypical, symphonic metal song which nevertheless clearly belongs to the genre?","Whoa. That sounds awesome. I'm not digging the growls though. Do they have any instrumental songs? Or is there a band with similar music?"
"What is the most original, atypical, symphonic metal song which nevertheless clearly belongs to the genre?","not sure and i can't recommend much but nothing with clean vocals.. probably hard to find symphonic metal this extreme with primarily clean vox . it is cool though isn't it!"
"What is the most original, atypical, symphonic metal song which nevertheless clearly belongs to the genre?","For example, Within Temptation's song *[And We Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awvqIi427_A)* has a typical Within Temptation sound...and then suddenly there's rap music by Xzibit. (I don't like it very much, but that's not the point.)

Another example, and a much better song in my opinion, is Nightwish's *[Scaretale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnYrscO5eN8)*, where the circus music and Marco's parts create a unique sound."
"What is the most original, atypical, symphonic metal song which nevertheless clearly belongs to the genre?","How about [Slow, Love, Slow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElbyDZYeAzU)? It uses a lot of jazz elements but it still manages to fit Nightwish's style, especially towards the end when the other instruments come in."
"What is the most original, atypical, symphonic metal song which nevertheless clearly belongs to the genre?","I love the atmosphere in that song, but I didn't include it because I don't think it is metal. It's still an absolutely amazing song though."
"What is the most original, atypical, symphonic metal song which nevertheless clearly belongs to the genre?","I'm a huge fan of Slow, Love, Slow. I wish I could find more songs like it but as far as I can tell its extremely unique."
"What is the most original, atypical, symphonic metal song which nevertheless clearly belongs to the genre?","Sonata Arctica's Cinderblox uses bluegrass influence. Very interesting. http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=H2Y7BjuLM5U"
"What is the most original, atypical, symphonic metal song which nevertheless clearly belongs to the genre?","[Heilig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC5xFSBH5PY) by Schlafes Bruder is definitely atypical, and if that isn't enough then there's [Schwarze Sonne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxTimWOT5bA) by E Nomine, although that's borderline symphonic metal with more electronic elements than metal (and E Nomine is definitely not a metal band). Therion also has a great variety of weird stuff; [Close up the Streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCiQx816OzE) from Gothic Kabbalah, [Birth of Venus Illegitima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o6lX_qdlLI) from Vovin and [The Flight of the Lord of Flies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f94dK4RkkC4_) from Deggial all being prime examples. Diablo Swing Orchestra have a bunch of weird and wonderful songs as well, but they're not exclusively symphonic metal."
"What is the most original, atypical, symphonic metal song which nevertheless clearly belongs to the genre?","Unbesiegt by Equilibrium off of sagas.  It has a Peruvian melodic line, an accordion and German growling vocals sung in German.  It is a very strange, but really cool song.  I have never heard anything like it.  

Some people may not consider it symphonic, but honestly, I can't think of any other metal genre that it would fit into. "
"What is the most original, atypical, symphonic metal song which nevertheless clearly belongs to the genre?","If you like Diablo Swing Orchestra try Unexpect. Their music is very eccentric and their first few albums are more of an acquired taste because of this. Their newest album however is a bit easier to listen to. My favorite tracks by them are Unfed Pendulum, Chromatic Chimera, and The Quantum Symphony.  "

"Amaranthe announce UK tour [FB]","They lack what's essential to Symphonic metal: the symphonic/ orchestral sound. "
"Amaranthe announce UK tour [FB]","They don't use any symphonic elements in their music (no orchestras, no choirs, no operatic singing), and they don't seem to take any inspiration from classical music or film scores. Those are the main things I use to identify a symphonic band. I guess the closest way to describe them would be melodic death metal with electronic/pop elements."

The songs are a bit metalified though."

(I guess it's pretty obvious from the language which I would prefer, hah!)"

I'd be pretty interested to know how they write their songs just because they fuse such different types of music and make it work - like whether they start off with a folk melody and add in the metal elements or if it all flows together from the start.

I'm not sure what your time constraints are or how formal it is but maybe they'd like to answer some more lighthearted questions about what their best/weirdest/funniest experiences have been with fans/concerts etc. I'm sure they have some really good stories to tell

"Within Temptation - Dangerous (Feat. Howard Jones) [Official New Video]","Agreed, at least at the moment. I have a tendency to not really like WT songs on first listen (despite them being one of my absolute favourite bands) and then end up loving them later on.

"Epica - The Essence Of Silence (New Single)","I'm really liking this. Very different while still being recognisably Epica.

"Nightwish - Nemo (Tarja &amp; Elize duet)","That was well done. I still wish Tarja was in the band, her voice lends itself well to the gothic feel of the band. The new singer I found brought a more celtic feel, and with that sound it felt more rock oriented than symphonic metal. "
"Nightwish - Nemo (Tarja &amp; Elize duet)","I really liked Anette Olzon.  I think I am in the minority.  Amaranth is my favorite song they have.

Floor Jansen has gorgeous vocals, though.  I am really looking forward to their next album."
"Nightwish - Nemo (Tarja &amp; Elize duet)","Though there was always a very vocal group of Anette haters, *Dark Passion Play* was the band's best selling album and *Imaginaerum* sold well too, so I think there are a lot more fans than the internet would have you think!"
"Nightwish - Nemo (Tarja &amp; Elize duet)","I really like Anette too, or at least Nightwishe's style with her, but Elize has a very similar 'pop' voice as Anette, but she has much more range, power and emotion. [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DbAruY9z-w#t=34) and [live](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=UmePt9RSLbc#t=22).

Edit: Oh I just saw on Wikipedia that Floor is going to be a permanent replacement. Next album is due 2015."
"Nightwish - Nemo (Tarja &amp; Elize duet)","That is actually a good fit. Floor has a voice a little more suited to their sort of style. [Is this her?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V_eoR6r1Tw) Because she can sing their old songs with a sort of delicate grandeur that the previous singer couldn't. 

Edit: The further I get into this song the more I believe she is what Nightwish has needed for a while. "

"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","I've listened to the album completely about 3 times already. I like it better after every listen. Some really good songs, some not so great. To me, this album is truly a mosaic of what they are capable of; most songs are straight up symphonic metal, some just generic metal, some a bit on the pop metal/rock side, and some experimentation (i.e., Xzibit). Some songs are reminiscent of their previous albums. I should also state that I was never a fan of The Unforgiving, so to me this album is positive step forward.  

A few thoughts on each song:  

1. Let Us Burn
&gt; An excellent song; a great opening piece. Catchy and reminds me of their older work. Probably my second favorite song on the album.  

2. Dangerous (feat. Howard Jones)  
&gt;I wasn't particularly excited about this song when it was first released, but after many listens, I like it. Howard Jones' voice really compliments the song. 

3. And We Run (feat. Xzibit)
&gt;I was most apprehensive about this song. This is definitely experimenting for WT. I was expecting this to be horrible, but was pleasantly surprised. I should note that I am an occasional listener of hip hop so my opinion may be biased, but this song works. Xzibit is able to rap successfully with the chugging riff of the guitar and his voice isn't too aggressive for the WT sound. My only gripe is that this song is more like an Xzibit song featuring WT; he had two verses compared to WT's one. 

4. Paradise (What About Us?) (feat. Tarja Turunen)
&gt;I love this song. When they first released this song, I was instantly in love with it and got me excited for Hydra. This song is the epitome of the WT sound and of course Tarja is excellent in this song. Her soprano voice is a great compliment to Sharon's light mezzo-soprano voice. 

5. Edge of the World
&gt;This is a good song; it took me a few listens to truly appreciate it, however. To me, it has a Silent Force vibe to it. A pretty light song where Sharon is able to demonstrate her vocal abilities.  

6. Silver Moonlight
&gt;This is without a doubt, my favorite song on the album for two reasons: 1) it reminds me Mother Earth and 2) GROWLS!! I liked the demo version, but the final product is leaps and bounds better. WT haven't experimented too much with growls and although not perfect, I think Robert's growls suit Sharon's voice just fine.

7. Covered By Roses
&gt;This is an okay song; a little too generic and ""poppy"" for my tastes, but I'll be damned if this song doesn't get stuck in my head.

8. Dog Days
&gt;In my opinion, the weakest song on the album. I never liked the demo version, and the final version isn't that much better.    

9. Tell Me Why
&gt;The longest song on the album, clocking in at a little over 6 minutes. A very good song. Some growls present on this song as well, but not as prevalent as in Silver Moonlight. 

10. The Whole World is Watching (feat. Dave Pirner or Piotr Rogucki)
&gt;A nice duet to end the album. The Polish edition of Hydra features Piotr Rogucki, whereas the other versions feature Dave Pirner. Both versions are excellent. I tend to like Piotr's version a little more. This song is reminiscent of Utopia, albeit more heavy and dynamic. 

Overall, I am quite pleased with this album. Mother Earth will always be my favorite from them, but ultimately bands change and I like the direction this album takes. The title is very fitting as they demonstrate to their fans the different types of songs they are capable of creating. My rating for Hydra: 8.5/10  

I'm curious to hear what everyone else thinks.

Edit: it looks like I'm in the minority"
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","Blah, I don't like it very much.

I liked the last one a lot, even more so because it was a concept album and the songs really worked together. This seems like a clusterfuck of all kinds of styles and metal sub-genres. It just doesn't feel like one album that you can listen in one sitting. And I'm sorry to say, but some of the songs are really boring. Edge of the World, Dog Days and The Whole World is Watching have some of the dullest choruses I've ever heard.

Songs I like: And We Run (didn't think I was gonna like this one), Paradise and Silver Moonlight (I think the growls were better in the demo version).

My rating: 5.5/10"
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","I did really like the concept of The Unforgiving. With that album I really felt like I could get immersed in its ""plot"", even if only subconsciously as I never really actively thought about it. For those who know League of Legends that album strangely fits Vayne perfectly.

I'll still wait and give Hydra a complete listen though."
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","The Unforgiving has kind of ruined album releases for me. It was the first album I actually waited for before it was released, I wasn't really into following bands before that point.

When it came out I was totally blown away from how awesome it was and since then I haven't been similarly blown away by any other album from any of my favourite artists...

Knowing this, I try to be less harsh on new albums, but I still hope that someday a release will surprise me and make me feel the way I did the first time I heard The Unforgiving."
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","I don't understand the desire to do co-operative albums here. While WT have great musicians, their real strength is Sharon's incredible vocals, sharing time with other vocalists usually dilutes that. 

That said, I like the album, though currently I prefer the demo versions of the individual tracks. "
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","I've listen to the album about two or three times myself. Instantly got hooked on Paradise and Dangerous from the singles. The album versions of Let Us Burn and Silver Moonlight have definitely been refined into amazing songs from the EP. Wasn't too sure about And We Run (got to hear the acoustic version in LA, and it was still beautiful), but after hearing it, instantly is going into my favorites. Edge of the World may take me a bit of time to warm up to the beginning of the song, probably cause it does contrast with the tone of the rest of the album some, but it's still an overall good song. Dog Days is definitely my least favorite just cause I haven't figured out a good way to get into that song, and their EP wasn't much better. Covered by Roses was good, but it's rhythm and beat kind of sounded like Edge of the World, but I could be crazy. The poem added a chilling touch which I did like. Tell Me Why is another great metal song from them, and Whole World is watching was probably the most beautiful of them all, hearing Sharon hit those notes at the end of the chorus just blew my mind. 

I'd rate it a solid 9/10, with The Heart of Everything beating it out at 10/10, but even that was over a long period of time to get there, so that means Hydra could end up a 10/10 in the future. "
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","This might be the first Within Temptation album I didn't like, and I'm really sad about that. WT is one of the few bands that consistently put out great content that I enjoyed very much.

The entire album feels, I don't know, kind of mechanical? It's feels very generic and without theme or anything that would tie it together or create atmosphere. It's the very same feeling I had about the latest Evanescence album. It's just so *ordinary.*

The Xzibit song is horrible. His voice adds nothing to the song.

The only song I really liked was Paradise, the one with Tarja. It's actually funny that it's better than anything she put out solo in the past few years, and only reaffirms my belief that she's a great singer that needs a *band* to giude her and produce amazing content.

The first song is also quite good, as is Silver Moonlight. But only good, the rest is meh.

All in all, I'm quite disappointed. It's a very forgettable album that's only good as background for gaming or something. It's not the worst thing I heard, but it's definitely the weakest album WT ever made."
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","The album starts of really well, the first 4 songs are awesome! 5th and 6th songs are pretty good as well. I don't really like Covered By Roses, agree with OP that it sounds generic, same goes for Dog Days, didn't like the demo and the final version isnt much better, Last 2 songs are really good, but Piotr's voice suits The Whole World Is Watching Much Better. I am kinda disappointed that there are only 10 songs though..."
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","Whoa, it's already out? Need to get it asap!"
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","It leaked about 10 days ago"
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","Yeah, listened to it today in the gym while training. Very nice album. A little more metal and less symphonic than usual, but it was still awesome. Gonna keep listening to it."
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","I'm waiting for the CD, but I've liked what I've heard so far. Looking forward to it!"
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","I was disappointed.

1. Let Us Burn
&gt;Solid, but the demo version was better.

2. Dangerous (feat. Howard Jones)  
&gt;Howard Jones is terrible.

3. And We Run (feat. Xzibit)
&gt;The rap section is utterly unrelated to the rest of the song, which isn't surprising since rap is so far removed from symphonic metal. I tried to be open-minded but it just doesn't work.

4. Paradise (What About Us?) (feat. Tarja Turunen)
&gt;Tarja is a collab which actually makes sense so it's not surprising that this one is solid.

5. Edge of the World
&gt;Inoffensive but unmemorable; terribly generic and doesn't remind me of The Silent Force at all. 

6. Silver Moonlight
&gt;As with Let Us Burn, the demo version was much preferable. They played down the growls which is an annoying compromise; they should have kept them as they were or got rid of them.

7. Covered By Roses
&gt;See #5 I suppose.

8. Dog Days
&gt;Quite repetitive and uninteresting. I'm not surprised by its universal dislike.

9. Tell Me Why
&gt;In the style of The Unforgiving but not as good as anything in that album.

10. The Whole World is Watching (feat. Dave Pirner)
&gt;I like it a lot! The guest dominates it so it doesn't really feel like a WT song, but it's excellent in its own right so I can't really complain. Haven't heard the Piotr Rogucki version yet.

====

So basically, there's #10 and then the three other good songs have already been released in the Paradise EP (and two of them in better versions, at that.) If you have that EP already than just get the single of Whole World is Watching.

If you do get Hydra, make sure you get the demo/evolution versions of Let Us Burn and Silver Moonlight.

"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","Haven't listened to the whole album, i'm hoping it will be availible in some store in my home town... Anyway, From what I have heard on YT its going to take some getting used to. I didn't like Evanescence's latest album until I listened to it a few times. Whats going to make it or break it for me is going to be if they can keep the message alive in all the songs, I can see a theme in some of the songs, we'll have to see if the album can bring it all together."
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","I think it's better than The Unforgiving, but not as good as their old stuff. Gotta admit I do enjoy Covered by Roses, but How We Run really doesn't work."
"For those of you that have listened to Hydra from Within Temptation already, what did you think?","Too commercial, even from them. Enjoyed them until THOE"

"Pythia posts on Facebook about an internal conflict they've been having","This is the post made on the band's official Facebook page (and the one I linked to):

&gt;As you may have heard there has been some upset in the band over the last 24 hours but we'd like to say that we all stand by our new album 100% and we'll be making a more official statement shortly. Emily and the band thank you for your continued love and support.

Only one week ago the band posted that their new album only needs a few final tweaks to be done. Everyone was really enthusiastic about their new album and all seemed fine, until yesterday. It seems pretty obvious that the argument is between lead singer Emily Alice Ovenden and at least three of the other band members.

Marc Dyos, founding member and drummer for Pythia, posted:

&gt;You can appreciate just how bad the situation has become when I am walking away from the band I created, on the brink of the release of our best album to date, but unfortunately a long-standing unprofessional and unreasonable presence within the band has ruined what was a strong, positive and rising force. Indeed, it is that particular presence within the band that has ‘blocked’ all other members of Pythia from accessing Pythia pages and accounts. 

And he signed off with this, leaving out the vocalist:

&gt;it is my hope that I can again work with Ross, Oz, Mark, and Marcus.

Two hours later guitarist Ross White announced his departure saying ""the reasons are the same"" and said that bassist Mark Harrington has resigned too.

Is Pythia breaking up? Founding member Ross White calls the upcoming Pythia album their final one in his Facebook status.

tl;dr: Three members of Pythia (at minimum) depart the band, the future of Pythia is unclear"
"Pythia posts on Facebook about an internal conflict they've been having","I saw a festival organiser saying he couldn't book them because ""it looks like they're disbanding"" - not sure if that was just a guess or if he's been told that the band are fully splitting up. A lot of people have pointed out that their statement refers to ""Emily and the band"" so it seems likely that they've fallen out with Emily."

"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)",""
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","I think people were expecting a huge dramatic song to be the first thing from this album, hence the negative reaction it's getting. I was surprised myself on the first listen. However, it seemed to get better on the second and third listen, and to be honest, I think this was chosen as the first single to show the growth and maturity of Nightwish. There's alot of depth to this song, more than you realize on the first listen, and the lyrics are beautiful. They are far beyond the early power metal phase and no longer rely on pure dramatics to evoke emotion, and are showing more intelligence and intricacies in the music - they have evolved, which also happens to be (probably not so coincidentally) one of the album's themes.

TL;DR: I like it."
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Eh. It's a good song, but very average. Feels like a rehashed Last of the Wilds with bits of I Want My Tears Back in it. And it's underwhelming in the same way that Amaranth is (and Nemo too, probably).

I think if you compare it to Storytime, which was pretty much a flawless Nightwish single, this one is very disappointing.

Also, putting Floor singing in that very soft, restrained way feels wrong, since Floor's voice is fairly aggressive, very strong and dynamic.

Kinda how DPP didn't really take advantage of Anette's voice either, and it took them until Imaginaerum to write melodies and vocal lines that fit her voice perfectly."
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","It's funny for me, reading in this thread that people think Amaranth and Nemo are boring/not as good songs, but yet for me, they are some of my favorites, right up there with things like Storytime.

*shrug* To each their own. I like this new single. :)"
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","[deleted]"
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Not a bad song, but kinda boring, reminds me of Amaranth a lot, a typical single for the label. Love Floor's singing though, feels very natural in the song. But... I'm sure Kai is a great drummer, but I miss Jukka going crazy behind the drums, he always showed so much energy in the videos..."
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","I like it a lot because it shows a style of singing that Floor doesn't use much in her work with After Forever/ReVamp/Epica/MaYaN/whatever other bands she has worked with. I remember her saying in the pre-album documentary series on YouTube that this album tested her ability to use many different singing styles effectively or something like that, so I think this may be one song she was referring to. It's nice to hear a more laid-back (while still beautiful) sound coming from her because we already know she's fully capable of being a badass metal queen from her other work."
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","&gt;Not a bad song, but kinda boring, reminds me of Amaranth a lot, a typical single for the label.

I expect that the best songs on the next album will not be the once released as singles, so I'm hopeful."
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","As far as Nightwish singles go, I'd probably rank this somewhere above Amaranth and below Storytime. It really fits the band and is a good way to say ""we're still the same Nightwish"". Unfortunately, I think most fans wanted to hear ""we're the new and improved Nightwish!""

I think it is a mature sound and there is a lot of nuance that wasn't there in earlier Nightwish, but it is also strange for them to pick something so subdued as the first single. Good song, but I'm not sure it's a good choice for a single. I have to admit, though, that I'm a big fan of what they've done with Floor. Everyone expected big and bombastic vocals, and instead they're showing off her other skills that often get overlooked."
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","I think this is the best summary I've read so far. Well-phrased and not so reactionary as a lot of people have been. You've explained my thoughts better than I could!"
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Not using her the right way. She has the most powerful, bombastic voice of any symphonic metal singer. That's what I wanna hear."

"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","It's great, just as expected and unsurprisingly a ""pop""-single. Solid performance from Floor and, hopefully, a promise of a really good album. "
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","I actually couldn't resist, I listened to the leaked version of this first. I have to admit that the leak sounded unfinished to me, not to mention the quality, so I was refraining from forming a true opinion until I heard it as it meant to be released.

That all said, this is significantly better. I read someone else say they could barely tell the difference. lieeees. The difference is crazy, not to mention that the leak didn't have the beautiful intro this one does. (I think it was supposed to be the radio edit?)

At any rate, I like it. I don't love it; I don't hate it. It's catchy, and different from what I'm used to hearing from Floor. I think this sounds like a song that was written with Anette's voice in mind, which is obviously a lot softer than Floor's.

I also feel like I've heard this before from Nightwish, though. May be the pipes that go in similar patterns as Last of the wilds? I'm still really excited and legitimately curious for what the rest of the album has to offer. There's no way the entire thing is as subdued as this song. 

Unrelated to anything musical: Floor's eye makeup seems to not match on some parts of the video... drove me crazy the entire time."
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","This is a really beautiful song exploring more mature themes and doing it well.  I think Floor really shines here.  I'm looking forward to the album.

I'm surprised no one has mentioned it yet.  This song is about facing death without fear but instead with a sense of wonder for what heaven holds for you."
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","I would have said it's about embracing the life you have left, and living life to the fullest. But I'm sure everyone's got different ideas on it!"
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Tuomas is doing absolutely no favors for Floor with this single.

There's a term in pro wrestling called ""getting over"". If someone ""gets over"", they get the required reaction from the crowd: a bad guy who's ""over"" will get booed, and a good guy who's ""over"" will get cheered. If you don't get the intended reaction you were supposed to get, you haven't been able to get over, and that's never a good thing in pro wrestling where good vs. bad storylines are the back bone of the entire business.

The reason I mention that is because this song isn't going to help Floor Jansen ""get over"". You've decided that **the very first Nightwish song** that people will hear with Floor will be as poppy and ""meh"" as possible. You're only hurting her popularity with the fans, especially the ones who aren't familiar with her work in ReVamp and After Forever who may not be aware of her range, power, and emotive singing. 

You've got a singer who can sing incredibly heavy stuff and do growls and a drummer who is renowned for his proficiency in extreme metal and melodeath; why not release something a bit heavier to get the fans excited, much like they did with Anette?

I'm sure we're all still going to listen to the album when it gets released, but it's saddening to think that Floor's legacy with Nightwish starts with this track.

**Edit:** Heaven forbid someone question Tuomas and not claim he's the greatest, right?"
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Nightwish actually said that they didn't want to have a single but that Nuclear Blast insisted. My guess is that the label wanted the most simplistic and radio-friendly song as is usually the way with singles."
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","&gt; much like they did with Anette?

you mean releasing a heavier song? because if so, that's not what happened. Eva was the first song released off of Dark Passion Play."
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","I was talking more in terms of the first video released, since that's the biggest source of promotion for the album."
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","I don't know about other people but my first exposure to Annette was Eva. "
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","To be completely fair, it's not like Anette was received very well. Maybe that wouldn't have happened if Bye Bye Beautiful had been the first single."
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Erm yeah that was my point exactly. They repeated the same mistake by releasing a very soft first song for both singers. "
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","I agree wholeheartedly, and I think they were expecting Showtime, Storytime to do a lot for Annette's popularity with fans."
"NIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Totally agree. After seeing what Floor can do with nightwish songs from showtime, this just felt... weak. I understand this is supposed to be a nice, relaxed song, but I don't know. Maybe Nightwish is evolving into something I don't like anymore. Fuck.

"Stream of Passion announce new album 'A War Of Our Own' for April 18th","On April 18 the Dutch metal band Stream of Passion will release their new album A War of Our Own through Pias/Rough Trade. A War Of Our Own is the result of the struggle the band had to endure after they decided to part ways with their record label and continue on their own path. 

Leader of the pack Marcela Bovio: “A corporate impasse such as this affects your peace of mind. The idea of crowdfunding changed everything. It was heart-warming to see how many people were prepared to support us and what they were willing to do to secure our future. Through this we've grown closer to our fans, they played a major part in creating this album.”

The red thread of the album is conflict in all its forms: personal battles, like disease and depression, corporate battles the band was confronted with themselves, but also the turmoil that destroys a land, mainly the drug wars of Mexico, the native country of Bovio. Musically the band has perfected their sound by ambitiously pushing their boundaries;  A War Of Our Own is more progressive and melodic than ever, with symphonic elements and an emotional undertone, heavy with Latin-American influences. 

In the last nine years Stream of Passion has released three studio albums, and a live-cd/dvd. In the meantime the band has also been touring the world, i.a. in Europe, Canada, Russia and Israel with bands like Epica, Sirenia, Leaves’ Eyes and Xandria. Around the release date several Dutch shows are planned, with two additional shows in the UK, a tour in Germany and a show at the Made of Metal Fest in the Czech Republic."

"
"Anaria - I See Fire (Ed Sheeran cover) Music video!","It's about time that we have a legitimate symphonic metal band from the US. I really enjoyed this. I look forward to hearing more. "
"Anaria - I See Fire (Ed Sheeran cover) Music video!","You guys have Kamelot at least ;)"
"Anaria - I See Fire (Ed Sheeran cover) Music video!","Wow kamelot completely slipped my mind.  "
"First dance song","I'm looking for a good symphonic metal song as a first dance song at my wedding.  The problem I'm having is most don't have appropriate lyrics or they are not quite slow enough.  Any ideas would be appreciated!"
"First dance song","Guy who dances way too much, here. I don't do much ballroom, so I'm not going to be able to pin down specific dance styles from that family, but I can tell you if songs are dancable and make stabs at the styles. 

A lot of symphonic metal doesn't have a clearly associated dance. I'm going to stick to more formal dances, and leave out things like, ""Oh, you could totally contemporary dance this!""

Here's my opinion of the songs that have been posted so far:

Ever Dream - Nightwish: Nope. 

I Walk Alone - Tarja Turunen: Yep. I'm not sure what it would be, but it is in the realm of Ballroom. You may also be able to tango nueva to it. 

Within Temptation - Angels: Nope. 

Within Temptation - Memories: Nope. 

Nightwish - While Your Lips Are Still Red: I like this one. It's in 4/4 (I think) and got a dancable tempo. 

Nightwish - Walking in the Air: Nope.

Nightwish: The Islander: Definitely dancable. Waltz and V Waltz, specifically. 

Epica - Tides of Time: Nope. 

Epica - Twin Flames: Nope. 

Xandria - Eversleeping: Almost definitely dancable. I don't know what style would be best, though.

Are You The One - Sharon Den Adel: Probably dancable, but it's a bit wonky. 

Nightwish - Forever Yours: You *could* dance to it. That doesn't mean you *should*.

Epica - Feint: Nope. 

Epica - Tides Of Time: Nope. 

Epica - Delirium: Nope. 

Epica - Nostalgia: Probably not. 

Epica - Linger: Nope. 

I'm not trying to tell you what to dance to, because you can make virtually anything work. I'd recommend finding a local dance studio and taking in your favorites. They should be able to put specific styles to them, and maybe even give you lessons for a few weeks to make your first dance even more kickass. "
"First dance song","&gt; Nightwish - Forever Yours: You could dance to it. That doesn't mean you should.

I laughed a fair bit at this. Nightwish are my favourite band of all time but Forever Yours is probably my least favourite song!"
"First dance song","This list helps a lot. Thanks. I already know a great song, but it was recently used by a friend - Remember by Dommin."
"First dance song","Hey, if you like it, talk with your friend. If your friend is a decent sort, (s)he should be flattered that you liked it so much, and be happy to have you use it as well.

As a dancer, it's about 50/50. It's very intense, very appropriate thematically, and is pretty dynamic. But, for most dances, there needs to be a nearly continuous, strong beat, which this song lacks. It seems to fall into a lyrical dance style than the social dance style (e.g. ballroom, latin, swing, etc). I'm more familiar with the latter, so I can't really give you advice there. "
"First dance song","Nightwish's [Islander](http://youtu.be/GGQZwWsgovc) can be danced as a waltz, which, according to Wikipedia, is the most traditional of the first dances in weddings. The lyrics are sort of wistful but in other regards I think it fits like a charm."
"First dance song","If only I had the ability to do something like that... Love the song though"
"First dance song","[Epica - Tides of Time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eALDD5XaQuw) has very appropriate lyrics, no idea if it´s suitable for dance."
"First dance song","Their [Twin Flames](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw5zfE_AzIY) is another option, with very fitting lyrics."

"First dance song","Ever Dream - Nightwish"
"First dance song","Isn't it a bit too fast, or am I being too picky?"
"First dance song","You are probably right. Have you tried something from Tarja's solo career? Probably [""I Walk Alone - Tarja Turunen""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwbtbfAnI80) which is pretty slow, though i'm not sure about the lyrics (let alone the title of the song). 

Edit: I also thought about[ ""Within Temptation - Angels""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK9qfVQ4Z04) and[ ""Within Temptation - Memories""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhzJO34SCoc) are pretty soft, though both songs lyrics are rather sad :( 

Edit 2: How about [""Nightwish - While Your Lips are Still Red""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiFk6KHr_8)? Sorry, huge Nightwish fan here... 

Also ""Nightwish - Angels Fall First"". Sad song aswell though. 

Last edit and idea: [""Nightwish - Walking in the Air""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaWPduHl_j8). "
"First dance song","While your lips are still red is a possibility. Memories is about losing someone and Angels is about deception, but I love both of them. I'll have to look into the others. Thanks!"
"First dance song","Another vote for While Your Lips Are Still Red here. That's one I've always thought about having as a wedding dance. Also The Heart Asks Pleasure First, but it could be too fast."

You can double check if they're suitable, I just narrowed it down a bit I guess. You could also try other bands if none of these work.



"
"First dance song","You could try that Nightwish cover... not sure how danceable it is, ugh what's the name ""heart asks pleasure first"" ? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF04p4oO7lI even though I like the instrumental version of the song better hehe. 

Also maybe Quietus by Epica? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El1Wq5trk2Y

Also, also, I used to be a ballet dancer... so I could probably dance to any of these, but not sure how much of that would yield nicely to a wedding dance.

Okay, last also... try something from Haggard maybe? Awaking the Centuries seems kind of dancy, but not sure if it's wedding material."

"Endless Forms Most Beautiful song title meanings","Put this list together for [my blog](http://hapfairy.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/bonus-post-endless-forms-most-beautiful.html). The overall theme of the album seems to be science, nature, evolution and living a good life.

1. **Shudder Before The Beautiful** - I’m assuming this is the one Nightwish's orchestrator Pip Williams was hinting at when he tweeted “a great rocking track that will make you shudder ;)” - so looks like we’re in line for another big opener, like Dark Chest of Wonders. The line features in a poem by Roy Fuller, which states ""even scientists shudder before the beautiful"".
2. **Weak Fantasy** - Slightly strange title, this one, and a bit of a mystery. I wonder if it could be referring to believing in things without evidence?
3. **Élan** - The lead single! Élan is a French word meaning spirit, zeal, momentum. Tuomas is probably referring to élan vital which was a term coined by philosopher Henri Bergson in his book Creative Evolution, to explain what he believed was the driving force behind evolution.
4. **Yours Is An Empty Hope** - A reference to Dante’s Inferno. This line is part of a passage about priests and holy men who are doomed because they are guilty of avarice. Most likely a dark and heavy song.
5. **Our Decades In The Sun** - Taken from a quote by Richard Dawkins - “The chances of each of us coming into existence are infinitesimally small, and even though we shall all die some day, we should count ourselves fantastically lucky to get our decades in the sun.” This is probably quite a positive track, given the quote.
6. **My Walden** - Walden is a book by Henry David Thoreau about living in nature. The author spent two years living in a cabin by a lake and described his experiences. My guess is that this might be a ballad - we do know that it has no orchestration.
7. **Endless Forms Most Beautiful** - The title track, it was already confirmed that this is a reference to a quote from Charles Darwin. “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.” Pip mentioned that the “title track contender” was “a rousing affair, featuring the largest orchestra” but it’s not confirmed whether he was referring to this track.
8. **Edema Ruh** - The Edema Ruh are a nomadic cultural group from Patrick Rothfuss’ Kingkiller Chronicle books. They are described as musicians and entertainers who travel around trading their art for hospitality. This could be a metaphor for the band themselves. Another one with no orchestration.
9. **Alpenglow** - This is the name given to the red glow on mountains just before sunrise or after sunset. Perhaps this could be a softer song, or something with more folk influences.
10. **The Eyes of Sharbat Gula** - Sharbat Gula is the name of the girl with piercing eyes in the famous National Geographic photo known as “Afghan Girl”.
11. **The Greatest Show on Earth** - The title of a book by Richard Dawkins on evolution (itself a famous circus slogan and sometimes used to refer to the northern lights - so perfect for Nightwish). As the album closer it is almost certain that this is the epic 25 minute track, and most likely the one that Dawkins will speak on. According to Pip, it has 5 parts. Apparently Tuomas’s instructions were to “Make it the ultimate show stopper- beautiful, melancholic, even biblical”. This one is going to be big!

There's also the bonus track **Sagan** which we can assume is about Carl Sagan. Anyone got any ideas about Weak Fantasy? It's the only one that's eluding me so far."
"Endless Forms Most Beautiful song title meanings","Huh. Interesting. I thought the track titles were really weird, but those interpretations/explanations make sense.

Though it's strange seeing so many direct references to literature and whatnot. It's really different from Tuomas's usual MO."
"Endless Forms Most Beautiful song title meanings","This definitely seems way different. I've very excited to hear it. The direct reference to the NatGeo cover is particularly interesting, I don't know that I've heard him directly reference a real event like that besides Kinslayer and Columbine.

Also you can tell Greatest Show is the long one for sure since it got a whole side to itself on the vinyl release!"
"Endless Forms Most Beautiful song title meanings","25 minutes? Holy crap, I knew this album would have their longest song yet, but I thought it would only be 14-15 minutes. They really outdid themselves on this album."
"Endless Forms Most Beautiful song title meanings","I'm a fan of long songs and I basically only like 2 songs that are greater than 20 minutes: [*The Great Escape*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq2qa1YTquI) by Seventh Wonder and [*Black Rose Immortal*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74VTf9RypfU) by Opeth.  

Hopefully *The Greatest Show on Earth* is number 3 and I hope not too much of it is speaking. "
"Endless Forms Most Beautiful song title meanings","Have you heard [Light of Day, Day of Darkness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWpwC1p-Ilw)?.

That's one of my favorite songs of all time. It's a beautiful masterpiece.

Also, Opeth is indeed awesome, though Black Rose Immortal isn't among my favorites (I prefer their 10-14 minute tracks, like Blackwater Park, Deliverance, Harlequin Forest, Hessian Peel, Moon Above Sun Below and a few other long songs)."
"Endless Forms Most Beautiful song title meanings","I have not, but I'll be sure to give it a proper listen when I get home.    

I definitely agree on the Opeth songs, I also prefer the ~10 min songs."
"Endless Forms Most Beautiful song title meanings","Black Rose Immortal has an interesting beat to it, but I'm a little iffy on the harsh vocals. Their texture(?) just doesn't appeal that much to me, I guess is how I would describe it.

The Great Escape, on the other hand, was amazing, and looking at the lyrics, is just completely sad (emotionally, not quality-wise), how it portrays the hopelessness in that situation and everything. "
"Endless Forms Most Beautiful song title meanings","Yeah, the harsh vocals were a little hard to get into when I first started listening to Opeth. Black Rose Immortal is from their second album and their music was a lot more harsh then (they don't have growls or make metal anymore, just prog rock), but Opeth is very diverse in their music.  

I'm glad you liked The Great Escape. I love that song too. I've probably listened to it over 50 times and every time it seems to get shorter! "

"Endless Forms Most Beautiful song title meanings","Pip Williams (who does the orchestration) tweeted a lot about there being an epic and long closing track in 5 parts. I think it was Mape Ollila (Nightwish's biographer) who was the first to say it was 25 minutes long. I don't know if there's been any official confirmation from the band of the exact length of the track, though."

"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","If it contributes to the creative work, cool. If it's to be 'edgy' or make a statement of some sort, I don't want to hear it."
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","I think/ really hope Dawkins will just be there to talk about evolution/ natural history and not religion. It should be the case since the two songs he's appearing on have names directly referencing evolution."
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","I think (hope) that might be it because the name of the album references Darwin and one of the songs is about Carl Sagan. It looks like it's more about science than religion.

But then again Epica talks about both science and religion together, so maybe that's what Nightwish wants to do..."
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","I'm fairly sure this is the case. Plus no-one who's listened to the album in the review sessions has mentioned him saying anything controversial, and I think it would've stood out if he had! "
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","uhh isn't this old news?"
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","[Here's a brief discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/symphonicmetal/comments/2jbl0u/richard_dawkins_will_be_heard_on_the_upcoming/) on the matter from four months ago."
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","Ah I didn't know that! I had just seen it on Tuomas' page."
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","Awesome! Dawkins has a great voice for delivering spoken passages, so this makes me quite happy. One of my personal pet peeves in symphonic metal (or music in general) is English spoken passages that are written and/or delivered by people who aren't fluent in English, so it's good to know that I won't have to worry about that for at least some passages on the new album."
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","Why is it a pet peeve of yours, if I may ask? :)"
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","I also want to know. Personally, I love it when I hear somewhat broken English in a different accent sang or spoken in music."
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","Me too! it's so cool to listen to various accents, I especially like listening to Song of Myself because of that. 

The part where a woman says ""The first thing I ever heard was a wandering man telling his story"" is my favourite, it just sounds so beautiful and melodic :)"
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","I should probably note that I have no problem with accents (I think accents can actually make spoken passages better in many cases), but such spoken passages are a pet peeve of mine mostly because from my experience, ones that are written and delivered by non-fluent speakers tend to have awkward word choice and, in the worst cases, bad grammar. I like to get immersed in the atmosphere and mood of songs I listen to, and spoken passages have a very strong effect on the atmosphere of the song they're a part of, especially since there's not usually much else going on musically while they're being delivered. When done well, they can greatly enhance the the experience of a song, but if they're done poorly, it can wreck the entire mood for me. Passages with odd word choice or bad grammar will often completely break my immersion. If I'm listening to epic fantasy-themed symphonic metal, I want the lyrics to reflect the grand, larger-than-life feel of the music, and if I hear mistakes or awkward word choice in the lyrics, it's a huge buzzkill. It makes it much harder for me to buy into the image the lyrics are trying to create. Part of the problem is that good lyrics are just hard to write, even for native speakers, and part of it is that I'm unusually picky, but because it's so hard to do well, I've become generally wary of spoken passages whenever they are written or delivered by a non-fluent speaker."

This is something I would've expected from Epica. It's a bit surprising to see that from Nightwish. Must've been Floor's influence from After Forever! :)"
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","Heheh, it was Tuomas's choice I believe as he's a big fan of Dawkins' books on science/evolution like the Magic of Reality and The Greatest Show On Earth (the latter which he has named a song after). Though Troy and Jukka have both worn t-shirts with Dawkins' name on as well so I think the whole band are on board with it."
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","Judging by Sagan he's a big fan of Sagan's Pale Blue Dot/Cosmos too, which is fucking awesome. "
"Richard Dawkins to be featured in upcoming Nightwish album. What do you think about that?","Well their song, Sagan, on their new single makes reference to Carl Sagan, so it really isn't all that surprising. I'm excited to hear their new album!"

"Now that we're half way through 2014, what are your favorite albums released so far?","I really liked The Quantum Enigma and Sacrificium. However, the album that surprised me the most has to be Argia by Diabulus In Musica. I wasn't really expecting much when I decided to give it a listen, but it really blew me away. "
"Now that we're half way through 2014, what are your favorite albums released so far?","Wow, Argia is surprisingly good! Thanks for mentioning it, wouldn't have known about it else."

"Now that we're half way through 2014, what are your favorite albums released so far?","I'd say The Quantum Enigma is technically the best album I've heard this year while Life And Times of Scrooge is the one I enjoy most emotionally (if that makes sense). That album is just so beautiful.

I've also really enjoyed The Human Contradiction and Sacrificium. I'm mixed on Hydra but I've listened to it a lot and I do really like most of the songs."

"Now that we're half way through 2014, what are your favorite albums released so far?","I'm not sure if you guys consider symphonic death in this sub, but if so Septicflesh - Titan is my favorite symphonic release of the year (so far).

Otherwise it's a tie between The Quantum Enigma and Sacrificium. "
"Now that we're half way through 2014, what are your favorite albums released so far?","This thread convinced me also to get TQE a few days ago and, having listened to it, I'll go with (in order or preference) Hydra, The Quantum Enigma, and Sacrificium as my three favorite 2014 albums thus far."
"Now that we're half way through 2014, what are your favorite albums released so far?","Like the others, Quantum Enigma. Still listening to it daily. Then again, I got into Epica only a few weeks before the release of TQE, so I've been binging on Epica since then.  "
"Now that we're half way through 2014, what are your favorite albums released so far?","Quantum Enigma, Hydra, and Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck for sure. Those are my top 3 so far, easily."
"Now that we're half way through 2014, what are your favorite albums released so far?","Like most others, I'd have to say: TQE then Hydra, Sacrificium, and A New Dawn Ending. I'm kinda new to the genre, so I've been getting into each band one at a time over the past few months."
"Now that we're half way through 2014, what are your favorite albums released so far?","Equilibrium's new album, Erdentempel, is stunning. But I'm going to have to follow the crowd on this and say The Quantum Enigma is the running champion. It's became my workout CD.

A few honorable mentions from my list: 
""Shogunate Macabre"" by Whispered (melodic death)
""Xenon"" by Mechina (melodic death)
""Lore of Lies"" by Lorelei (symphonic deathcore)
""We Are All Sinners"" by Upon This Dawning (symphonic metalcore)
""Phantom"" by Betraying the Martyrs (also, symphonic deathcore)

Symphonic deathcore/metalcore is a guilty pleasure of mine. I apologize in advance."
"Now that we're half way through 2014, what are your favorite albums released so far?","Hydra is more consistent quality-wise to me, but The Quantum Enigma peaks a lot better than Hydra does."

&gt;__Northern Kings__ is a [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland) [symphonic metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphonic_metal) [cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_band) supergroup, made up of four musicians who have already become well known in their existing bands: [Jarkko Ahola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Ahola) from [Teräsbetoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ter%C3%A4sbetoni), ex-[Dreamtale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamtale), [Marco Hietala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Hietala) from [Nightwish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwish) and [Tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot_(band\)), [Tony Kakko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Kakko) from [Sonata Arctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonata_Arctica) and [Juha-Pekka Leppäluoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juha-Pekka_Lepp%C3%A4luoto) from [Charon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_(band\)) and [Harmaja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmaja_(band\)).

&gt;Their first single, ""[We Don't Need Another Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Don%27t_Need_Another_Hero)"", (originally performed by [Tina Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Turner)) was released in 2007, followed by their debut album *[Reborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reborn_(Northern_Kings_album\))*. In late 2008, their second album *[Rethroned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rethroned)* was released, headlined by the single ""[Kiss from a Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_from_a_Rose)"" (originally performed by [Seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(musician\))).  They released a new single ""[Lapponia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapponia_(song\))"" in 2010, and are also planning their third album which will include original material.

"Symphonic Metal Supergroup.","Floor Jansen, Jari Maenpaa, Tuomas Holopainen, Linus Klausenitzer (from Obscura, not really symphonic but we need a standout bassist), Kai Hahto.  Man that would rule, only had to tap 3 bands too."
"Symphonic Metal Supergroup.","As with Gothic metal band Tristania and similar acts, I would like to utilize a variety of vocal styles. Here is my line-up:

Floor Jansen (Femme Vox) - Esteemed for her bold, versatile vocals with Dutch band After Forever and her latest project ReVamp, Floor has also contributed her talents to such powerhouse bands as Nightwish, Epica, and Ayreon. Floor is incomparable as a singer; she has an uncanny ability to sing in operatic, Broadway, AND metal styles. Her overall image and presence make her an ideal candidate. There is no one else I would choose over her, although I bet Vibeke Stene (ex-Tristania) could more than hold her own.

Roy Kahn (Male Vox - Cleans) - Roy of Kamelot has the most expressive, compelling male voice. I love contrast in my metal - the male and the female, the cleans and the screams, the lachrymose and the primal - so pairing him with both Floor and a screamer is my ideal. 

Morten Veland (Male Vox - Screams) - While Morten's latest projects have disappointed me a little (okay, a lot), I was always impressed with his harsh vocals for Tristania. I would have chosen Angela Gossow, ideally, but I think Morten is the best screamer in symphonic metal. His raw, almost black-metal vocals are unhindered by most growlers' mistakes (sad truth is, harsh vocalists rarely enunciate).

Arjen Lucassen (Guitars) - Not an obvious choice genre-wise, but his metal opera Ayreon earned him great distinction - even though his main role was as its creator. He did, however, deliver excellent progressive guitar work to Stream Of Passion (don't get me started on the name), another of his projects.

Kurt Bednarsky (Bass) - Kurt, the Edenbridge bassist, gives a marvelous performance every time. I love his passion and the dedication he shows towards his work. I have always been very impressed with this band.

Tuomas Holopainen (Keys &amp; Synths) - Who else could I choose, really? The thought of naming someone else is so ludicrous that I even considered doing so, just knowing that everyone would think I'm insane. No, but Tuomas really is the best. His style proved revolutionary to the genre (sub-genre? sub-sub-genre?), and his influences led him to create the most unique and beautiful music. He is so adept with his piano and compositions that...well, let's just say that Tuomas is one rare musician I'd call an Orpheus (read: I'd wax poetic and totally embarrass myself). :)

Pete Johansen (Violin) - This is a subreddit for symphonic metal, so I'm going to add this additional musician to the line-up. Pete is best known for his work with Tristania, Sirenia, The Sins Of Thy Beloved, and Morgul. I've never heard someone play a classical instrument so adeptly, and certainly not as a recurring guest musician in numerous metal bands. There is simply no way I can leave him out.

Well, there's my line-up. Gods, I just about wrote a novel! LOL. :)

Taking French pop songs from the 60s and 70s and then turning those into such a great symphonic metal album is like magic to me."
"Therion - Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son [NSFW]","Agreed. *Les Fleurs du Mal* is not my favourite Therion album, but I really respect that they are not afraid to test new bold ideas like that one.

We only discovered the change in vocalists about 30 minutes before the show but were impressed by show's end! I wanna see them now that Floor is a proper fixture of the band. She apparently knew the songs but only had that day to prepare for a live show with Nightwish so in that case she did phenomenal!"
"Nightwish - Planet Hell (Official video - live from first show with Floor)","Wow, I had no idea she was so tall. Or maybe they're just short. She's 6'1"".

Not the best choice for a first official video with the new singer, IMO. With it being live and a song that doesn't showcase her voice that much it just didn't really do much to show what the new Nightwish is going to be like. They'd have been better off picking a song with a stronger female lead part, or maybe even waiting for Floor's first album as they did with Anette."
"Nightwish - Planet Hell (Official video - live from first show with Floor)","This isn't the first official video with her. They have released three other live performances with her. One of them being Ghost Love Score that showcased her voice. And they have a full show DVD with her her"

"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","Symph. Metal (and all the variations of it) has been arguably my top favorite genre for many years now...it all started when a friend showed me Ghost Love Score by Nightwish, and Nightwish has since then remained a top favorite band of all time (although The Poet and the Pendulum has taken its place as my favorite Symph. Metal song).

That further chained into getting into all of the following bands at some point (some more than others, such as having only heard one album by Xandria, but all from Epica): 
After Forever, Dark Moor, Dimmu Borgir, Edenbridge, Epica, Kamelot, Mortemia, Nemesea, Pythia, Rhapsody of Fire, Serenity, Sirenia, Tarja, Tristania, Within Temptation, Xandria.

There's bound to be plenty of notable bands of the style that I've missed out on so far, and I'd love some pointers on which ones I should look into first, based on the list above :3"
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","There are many more bands within the genre, but you have mentioned most of the big ones. There are three bands I am surprised you have not listed, because they are huge in the scene. In random order:

&amp;nbsp; 

1 - **Therion**

This band can be considered the original symphonic metal band. They started out as a late 80's death metal group, but introduced keyboards and gradually more symphonic elements in the early '90's. Their album *Theli* was incredibly influential for the whole of symphonic metal and contains one of their best tracks, [To Mega Therion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdTVNbDT_8M). 

My favourite albums are *Live Gothic* and *Secret of the Runes*, most fans consider *Lemuria* and *Sirius B* to be their best work. Therion has produced [a number of great songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq4HZV_UTs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6m10s) and albums, but also a few rotten apples.

&amp;nbsp; 

2 - **Leaves' Eyes**

Frontwoman Liv Kristine used to be the vocalist for Theatre of Tragedy, the band which developed 'Beauty and the Beast lyrics' (the exchange between harsh male and operatic female vocals). After departing from Theatre of Tragedy she joined forces with Atrocity to form Leaves' Eyes. 

My favourite albums are *Symphonies of the Night*, *Njord* and *Vinland Saga*.

&amp;nbsp; 

3 - **Delain**

Created by the former keyboardist for Within Temptation and frequently featuring guest vocals by Nightwish's Marco Hietala. Delain is on the mainstream end of the spectrum for symphonic metal: catchy tunes and understandable lyrics. No 15-minute epics, operatic vocals, or obscure texts in dead languages here. Still some very enjoyable stuff.

My favourite albums are *The Human Contradiction* and *Lucidity*.

&amp;nbsp; 

There are of course a great many smaller symphonic metal bands, but only one of these would I recommend without any reservations:

&amp;nbsp; 

4 - **ReVamp**

Floor Jansen's project since the disbanding of After Forever. Both albums produced so far are great."
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","All of these are excellent, but I personally don't like Delain as much as the others. I'm just not a fan of her voice and think the songs are a little too simple for me. Still worth a try though."
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","Delain is different from most other symph singers, she is trained classically and in Jazz, while most other trained vocalists come from operatic stock.


Their songs are more focused on feelings and relatable situations, rather than more fantastical verses. A number of their songs use metaphors and vivid imagery though"
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","I'm very disappointed in myself for not trying out Delain until now...

I just listened to Lucidity, and enjoyed it a lot.
I then moved onto April Rain, and the very first time I heard the title track (April Rain) I fell in love like I haven't with a song in a while...definitely love Delain so far. Her voice during the chorus of that song in particular is so amazing sounding."
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","If you enjoy Delain, Within Temptation style of music, check out Winter In Eden. Very similar."
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","Very informative and detailed answer, thanks for the background info on the bands. As I stated in other comments, I will definitely check out Therion at this point. 

Leaves' Eyes is one that I've heard of once or twice, but had no previous inclination to try out until now.

Delain, on the other hand, has been #1 on my list of ""curious to try out"" bands for months now, but I've been so focused on other bands that I never did just yet. Definitely will now. Same goes for ReVamp."
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","Turisas is one I'm really into at the moment. 

Give 'Cursed be Iron' or 'Miklagard Overture a listen'. "
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","Yay, finally someone else raising the Turisas torch high! Miklagard Overture is especially awesome if you've ever been to Istanbul - the lyrics are pretty much spot on in its description of the city and its surroundings."
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","Tursias is one that I have never once heard of yet, but I'll definitely check out now that I have their name."
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","Sonata Artica are a good band, their songs are hit and miss, some being very good, others more forgettable. Their singer Tony kakko is amazing live, a very passionate singer. 

Ancient Bards are good.


For something different, look up Northern Kings


For something very different, try Van Canto"
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","Sonata Arctica, I'm only familiar with 1 song by them, ""Don't Say a Word"" from Reckoning Night. I've listened to all of Reckoning Night once, and I wasn't disappointed, but haven't gone back to try it out again, but I will now.

Ancient Bards, never heard of them, but will remember them now. 

Northern Kings, I've heard of, because I absolutely love Marco Hietala. Just haven't tried them out yet.

Van Canto, I've heard of, because of their cover of Wishmaster by Nightwish."

"
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","Also, not only are Sonata Arctica awesome live, they are some of the nicest individuals I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.  I had a great experience when I met with them back in 2008 when Tony had gifted me with a piece of history from the tour.

After shows, they would drive these remote control cars around the parking lots of the venues.  Tony's was this beat up yellow Chevrolet Corvette.  As our city was the last stop on the U.S. Tour, he came out of the bus with his car and asked those of us who were there for a meet and greet why he should give this car to one of us.  He gave it to me because I had brought my History binder out for them to sign (I had nothing else on me that was signable as it was all black).  He said that he admires education and most of all history, and gave me the car to keep.  He told me I should sell it because it would be worth a bit on eBay.  I told him I wouldn't sell it.  I never did.  It sits in my study now, and I look at it every time I feel like I'm about to quit school or work, or anything else.  I'm currently in my master's program for Secondary Education, with plans to graduate Summa Cum Laude in 2015 or 2016.  When the going gets tough, I look at that car and remember what I am doing, and what my personal goals are.

I showed a picture of the same race car to him last week during a meet and greet before a concert, and he said ""Holy shit, look at that!  I remember you!  How is your schooling going?""  He passed the phone down to the other members who were there and would have remembered (They have replaced their bassist since my last encounter).   It was really heart-warming to be remembered by these guys.

Oh, and for proof, I will upload the pics in a few hours when I am finished at work."
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","Therion is in my opinion almost an obligatory pick. You may also want to try Blind Guardian or Haggard. "
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","See above for my response to Therion/Blind Guardian.

Haggard, though, I actually have downloaded some of, but haven't gotten around to listening to yet."
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","To echo what others have suggested: Therion, Leaves' Eyes, Blind Guardian (later stuff for more symph sound) and ReVamp. I would also say give Diabulus in Musica a listen. Their last album was pretty good. You may also want to try Coronatus. They have two singers with different styles, so they're unique in that way.   

Edit: also check out Serenity, if you like Kamelot"
"Exploring new Symph. Metal bands","Therion is one of the big names that I've heard time and time again, but never tried out. I'll be sure to now :)

Blind Guardian, I am into a bit, I didn't include them on the list because I only knew of them as Power Metal, not really Symph. Only listened to A Twist in the Myth, though.

ReVamp, also on my list, because Floor Jansen is arguably my favorite female artist in the genre.

Diabulus in Musica, never heard of them, but will remember them. Same for Coronatus.

"Nightwish - Sagan",""
"Nightwish - Sagan","I like both this and Elan (too lazy to figure out how to add the accent character, sorry).

It's different than anything Nightwish has done before, but I still hear a lot of what makes Nightwish great in this song. Can't wait for the full album. :)"
"Nightwish - Sagan","This is song is way better than Èlan in my opinion. Still too chorus-heavy for my tastes, but a good song nonetheless. "
"Nightwish - Sagan","the problem with singles is from each of the albums sicne once there haven't been many tracks that work as standalone songs. The reason they did Eva for DPP and Storytime for Imaginarium is because they were the closest to that.

Sagan was obviously deemed as not good enough for the album so they kept it for the single release of elan. it is a more upbeat track.

Elan is probably the albums soft ballad. Liek slow love slow was on Imaginarium ( which to be honest is the only time i though anette did a better job than anyone i could think of to sing it.)"
"Nightwish - Sagan","I prefer Èlan over Sagan."
"Nightwish - Sagan","they are both good tracks."
"Nightwish - Sagan","Wait, is this another leak or legitimate?"
"Nightwish - Sagan","Legitimate, it is on the single."
"Nightwish - Sagan","It's better than Élan, but both songs are fairly uninteresting and nothing that I haven't already heard a dozen times before."
"Nightwish - Sagan","After hearing this and Elan. I don't think the new album is what I was hoping it would be."
"Nightwish - Sagan","I reserve judgement until i've heard the entire thing."
"Nightwish - Sagan","So you're gonna draw conclusions over a generic single that a bunch of reviews have mentioned that it's not representative of the entire album and a bonus track that doesn't even belong in the album itself?"
"Nightwish - Sagan","Yeah, I tend to draw conclusions from my own experience with music, not what reviewers tell me to think. If there are bigger and more dramatic songs on the new album that I like, then yay for me. If not, then I guess I'll be disappointed, I can live with that, there is plenty more music out there that I am yet to enjoy. 
But I will never let anyone tell me what I music I should and shouldn't like."
"Nightwish - Sagan","Then maybe go from a historical basis?

The singles from DPP were Amaranth, Eva and Bye Bye Beautiful, all of which were filler songs. The single for Once was Nemo.

It's not like Nightwish albums are known for lacking mainstream-friendly/filler songs.

Not to mention that reviewers only give their opinions for the most part, not tell others what to think."
"Nightwish - Sagan","You realize singles are there to make someone interested in an album, to give the listener a reason to buy their new album. Right? If that's the case, then Nightwish is doing a terrible job and I'll keep judging their album on what I hear of it. 

Seems like a moronic move of them to just go ""hey here's our unimportant, crappy filler songs that doesn't really colour our album in any positive way at all or give you an example of what the album is about. Don't forget to buy our new album!""

Shit like this is the reason pirating is so big. At least bands are more open to streaming their full album when it's released, I hope Nightwish does the same or I'm not gonna buy it.

For the purpose of being on topic, I really dislike the softer rocky side Nightwish takes here. I really hope we're not seeing the complete exit from the metal world by Nightwish here. I've already lost In Flames, don't want to lose another band :/"
"Nightwish - Sagan","Yes, I am perfectly aware of that. However, realistically, that doesn't end up being the case. Vast majority of the time, the singles end up being the most generic, boring, filler songs with barely any redeeming or interesting elements, but catchy and accessible enough to play on TV and radio and to get some people interested.

It's pretty much never aimed at the existing fanbase (which usually already has high expectations by default), only at random people who might have a passing interest.

The exceptions to this trend are usually excellent albums with minimal/nonexistent filler and/or singles that happen to be great songs (relevant examples would be Storytime from Nightwish, The Essence of Silence and Unleashed from Epica).

And yeah, I pirate every album I'm curious about. If I don't like it, I delete it, and if I do like it, I end up buying it. I even do this with albums I'm particularly hyped about (including the upcoming Nightwish album).

I don't expect NW to do any full album streams though. That's usually up to the record label itself, and with Tuomas lately going on about the ""mystery"" of new albums being ruined by the internet and leaks, I think they want to avoid that sort of thing, honestly.

Anyway, I wouldn't be afraid if I were you. A lot of the previews/reviews/first impressions of the album said the album is very diverse, Élan isn't really representative of the album and it's the weakest track, and the album itself concludes with a 24-minute beast of a track, which I'm especially excited about.

Sagan is good and Élan is nice but forgettable, but what I care about is the rest of the album and that epic long track at the end."

"I'm new here and I have a question","So I've listened to some symphonic metal for a while and I was wondering about the demographic about its listeners. I'm from the US so a lot of my peers have never heard of bands like Epica, Within Temptation, Xandria, etc. Is symphonic metal considered a ""girly"" version of metal? This genre has been my guilty pleasure for a while. Please tell me that guys listen to these bands also.  

Edit: Thank you everyone for your answers! I was kinda self-conscious about liking symphonic metal, but not any more!

2nd Edit: I want to clarify that no one has actually said that symphonic metal is girly, it is just a self-conscious thought of mine and how I think other typical metal listeners might view it. "
"I'm new here and I have a question","Mid-twenties Asian-Canadian male. I get more confused looks than scoffs whenever I mention my odd musical preference. Most of my friends who are into hard rock and metal are always happy to go with me to concerts headlining female-fronted bands like Epica, though it's always a bonus if a band like Alestorm or Sabaton are supporting as well. If any one criticizes you for listening to ""girly"" metal, just shrug and tell them that you can't help it if you rather have a woman sing to you than some dude with ratty hair ;)"
"I'm new here and I have a question","Mid-twenties American male. I hadn't even heard about the negative stereotypes associated with the genre until very recently, and I've been listening to Nightwish for years.  Mostly, I've just received weird looks when I say ""symphonic metal"".

I've never had anyone give me crap, but I have had people tell me that some people *would* give me crap. The thing is, I don't care. I love this music, even if it causes some raised eyebrows.  You know what? I think I like it more *because* of the raised eyebrows."

"I'm new here and I have a question","Midtwenties east/central European male here... I don't have the time anymore, but in my highschool/college days I spent a lot of time in one of the Metal-ish bars in my town. Nightwish, Epica, WT were a large part of the playlists, though it played anything from Hard Rock to Death metal. The people were a mostly even mix of male and female, and everyone knew the big names of Symphonic - Nightwish and WT, that is. Epica was sadly, less represented at the time, although that's not surprising since they didn't really exist for most of those years :) 

Edit: Also, this is the first time I hear of any stereotype associated with Symphonic in general. Never heard of anyone saying anything against this genre specifically, just your basic ""You have long hair -&gt; you're a rocker -&gt; satanist!!"" crap. "
"I'm new here and I have a question","Never met another person with a similar taste in music than me, I'm 20 and English. I've tried to find folks who like similar stuff, but the closest I get is people who like basic metal.

I've never considered it, nor heard it be called, 'girly' metal. I can maybe see why someone would say so, but I can't see why they could *justly* say so. People like different things, and everyone is allowed their own likes and dislikes. "
"I'm new here and I have a question","No one has actually called it girly, but in my mind I think people judge it as being not a real metal genre since it has operatic/melodic female vocals. "
"I'm new here and I have a question","well then I'm gonna need a strict definiton of 'real metal'. Symphonic Metal is vast, just like basic metal. Something like Symphony X is nothing like Nightwish, despite a few common themes.

However, when I went to see Nightwish live, I met a lot of people (guys and girls) who knew a lot about Symphonic Metal. I've personally never heard anyone refer to it as ""girly"", but I can see why some people would call it that. You're always going to come across someone who is an elitist that only listens to extreme metal and dismisses everything else as not ""Trve"" Metal. "
"I'm new here and I have a question","American 23 year old guy here. Just saw my favorite band, Within Temptation, in Los Angeles and even got to participate in a meet and greet with about a hundred people. Needless to say, I nearly flipped my shit because I've never even seen them in concert before, and I got to talk with, pose with, and even listen to Sharon, Robert, and Ruud play a few songs for us for FREE!!! This is cause Within Temptation sadly never plays any shows in the USA with a small following here, and as such, very few of my friends ever heard of the band (I had actually introduced it to my boyfriend). Those who did know were also mostly men, but I don't believe that their genre of symphonic metal should be considered gender-specific, we can all acknowledge that it is beautiful music, and it's fit for anyone to listen to. (Also, never heard anyone tell me it sounded ""girly"" to them, and I'd grill them on why that's not a bad thing.)"
"I'm new here and I have a question","18yo male Western European here.
I spend a lot of time playing online games, and I actually got introduced to Nightwish by a fellow WoW guildmate. Another one of these guildmates is actually a female singer for a little symphonic metal band, some other mates were metalheads.

A part from people I met online though, I had to introduce all my friends to this (even though they mostly listen to rap, or bands like SoAD/Metallica, they have a really hard time with english so I guess its harder for them to feel the poetry in it), except one who knew Sonata Arctica for Letter to Dana/Shy.

Have to admit I got a lot of weird reactions and stereotypes about that,  I once went to high school with a NW shirt and I got at least 2 people telling me that its totally metal for girls, and I shouldn't be listening to it. Plus the classic ""omg do you believe in Satan ?"" ""why don't you have long hair and wear non-black things ?"" ""can you headbang in front of me please, i never seen it before [has a Nirvana T-Shirt] ?"""
"I'm new here and I have a question","I'm a 24-year-old female from the UK. Although I had briefly heard of Nightwish when I was about 14, it wasn't until I was 17 and met some new people who introduced me to Within Temptation that I really learnt what symphonic metal was. They were playing a rare concert nearby, so I went along and got hooked.

In general, most people round here wouldn't know what symphonic metal was. I've found amongst metalheads that it is more well known, but there is largely quite a stigma attached to it. I once had a guy at a metal night literally turn around and start ignoring me because I said my favourite band was Nightwish. It seems like it's often a bit of a prejudice based on people not liking clean/operatic singing (I've not encountered anyone who has a problem with Arch Enemy). A super elitist guy I knew that only liked black and death metal was actually quite happy to listen to Epica once I'd introduced him to them and explained what people like about the genre. It's a different story if you go to a symphonic metal concert though, of course - everyone's a fan there!

As for the gender thing, I have actually heard people saying that symphonic metal is for girls, so you aren't imagining it! It's mostly the kind of thing said in awful YouTube comments and such. However, at every concert I've been to it has been at least 50% male if not more. I'm an admin on the Muses of Metal facebook page (a fanzine for female-fronted bands but largely covering symphonic metal) and according to the stats, the page likes are from 66% males and 34% females. So you are not alone..."

"I'm new here and I have a question","18 year old Turkish guy here. I have a few friends from the school that are symphonic metal fans like me.

I've never heard anyone say something bad about it like girly or such. I've actually encountered quite a few people that don't usually listen to metal but know of a popular band. (Nightwish, Haggard or Epica) "
"I'm new here and I have a question","You must know of Almora, then? I first encountered them while doing research prior to my four-month trip to Istanbul, and was extremely impressed with how elegant Turkish sounded in their songs - very flowing, almost like what I imagine Elvish to be. A shame the band's no longer around, even if the leader continues to do his own non-metal pieces."
"I'm new here and I have a question","Surely. [Catafalque](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1y38Vro300) is another former symphonic/gothic metal band, though they don't have any songs in Turkish afaik. Then there is Pentagram[[1]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgGClkwAQiY)[[2]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjI2L-8k_HE) which is mostly power/thrash metal but they're rather popular and still going strong after 25 years."
"I'm new here and I have a question","I'm a 24y/o American male surfer. I was just in Sweden, and Nightwish played over the radio in a busy city sportsbar full of rowdy hockey fans, and no one even thought twice. The American scene tends to just be less accepting of diversity in the people who are into metal for the image/lifestyle-appearance. Anyone who actually likes any metal-derived music, even if they only like grindcore or whatever, will still acknowledge the musical contribution that genre-bending, or genre-redefining bands have had in furthering the metal movement."

My impression of the concerts I attended was that the majority of attendants is male - but that is nothing special, as metal in general seems to have more male than female fans. The only special aspect of Symphonic Metal compared to other Metal subgeneres I can think of is that I found it to be more accessible to people who are not really into metal otherwise, especially if they like classical music."
"I'm new here and I have a question","20-something, American male.

Symphonic metal is as ""girly"" as you want to make it seem. But for bands such as Wintersun, Dimmu Borgir, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Cradle of Filth, and Carach Angren, I can assure you that there is ""Manly man"" symphonic metal that gains you the appreciation of traditional ""heavy metal"" listeners.

And then you have the ""punky teenager"" bands like Motionless in White, Wolf Hollow, Make Them Suffer, Betraying the Martyrs, and Winds of Plague if you ever decide you want to make friends quickly with some ""rebellious"" children in their late teens. Look 'em up if you want to see what I mean.

"Epica - Unchain Utopia (4:45) [2nd single from The Quantum Enigma]","I think the closest they have come to a bad album was Requiem for the Indifferent, and that album was still pretty good. I had a number of problems with RFTI: the guitars had a strange and sometimes jarring tone (ex: guitar solo on Monopoly on Truth), too many songs were forgettable (mainly from the last half of the album), and it didn't have as large of a sound as their previous albums (it sounded more stripped down and minimalistic).

I was getting worried that Epica was starting to head down hill, so I am ecstatic that the first singles from the Quantum Enigma are so promising. The sound is more massive and multi-layered than ever, the guitars are brutal but blended well, orchestral elements are more prominent, and the larger choir sounds amazing. If the rest of the songs from TQE are consistently this good, then this will be a strong contender for Epica's best album. "

In terms of what might be branded as Symphonic Metal, I've almost exclusively listened to only two albums: Oceanborn and Wishmaster (Nightwish's Tarja-era, symphonic power metal phase). I keep trying to branch out, but I always find myself comparing other bands' vocals to Tarja's soprano. 

This subreddit has been rich in suggestions. The most notable being Epica, as people say they 'sound' like Nightwish. To be honest though, I don't think I agree entirely. I can appreciate Simone, but her voice pales in comparison to Tarja's. I guess I prefer opera-like singing to Simone's - excuse the term - alternative-ish tune. I also gave other groups a listen, like Xandria, but nothing just seems to top Tarja.

So I begin to question my liking of Symphonic Metal. Can I really consider myself a ""fan"" of the genre if I can't seem to branch out? Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. 

Perhaps my taste is just too keen. It would be nice though if any of you can tell me otherwise and offer some suggestions. "

"Any Symphonic Metal albums similar to Oceanborn and Wishmaster?","Did you try Neverworld's End from Xandria? I would say that has the most Tarja-like vocals. Also perhaps Amberian Dawn would be worth a try - End of Eden is probably a good one to start with. 

There was a similar thread to this before and I was saying that really, I don't think there are any bands that truly sound like Nightwish. But when I first got into the genre I basically only listened to Within Temptation and Dark Passion Play/Once - everything else sounded strange to me. I didn't get Epica at all. It took quite a while and a lot of forcing myself to listen widely to make myself love the whole genre. I wouldn't worry - even if you only ever like those two albums, you can still call yourself a fan."
"Any Symphonic Metal albums similar to Oceanborn and Wishmaster?","Could try Leaves' Eyes.  I really like Tarja-era Nightwish (was my first exposure to symphonic metal), and Leaves' Eyes is one of my favorite bands."

"Any Symphonic Metal albums similar to Oceanborn and Wishmaster?","Try [Pythia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ6e1ibOd40), best Nightwish clone I've heard. It's actually power metal and not symphonic, but no need to restrict yourself to one genre ;)

Note: I only know this one song from this band, no clue if their other stuff is good. "
"Any Symphonic Metal albums similar to Oceanborn and Wishmaster?","Don't worry, I was in a similar position to you when I started. At first I liked only Oceanborn and a couple of songs from other early Nightwish albums, then boom, other bands suddenly started to appeal to me in great numbers. It may take some time and patience, but I believe that, sooner or later, the branching out will happen to you naturally. Just allow yourself to experiment a bit from time to time, and don't be too quick to discard things you don't enjoy right now - instead shelve them for few months and see if your opinion of them will change. In my case it took over a year to finally get into Epica, but it was worth it. 

Sorry that I'm not offering you any specific recommendations, it's been a while since I was really following the female-fronted stuff and other people here have already mentioned some good ideas. The most typically symphonic power metal bands are in my opinion Rhapsody of Fire and Blind Guardian, but their style is rather different from Nightwish. Perhaps you could try early Within Temptation though."

"Any Symphonic Metal albums similar to Oceanborn and Wishmaster?","Just to add to what everyone else has suggested, have you checked out Tristania?

"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","Who has seen Within Temptation's latest DVD *Let Us Burn*? What did you think? Any favourite tracks? Would you recommend it?

I'll start: I was very impressed with the *Elements* half. I'd already watch fan footage on YouTube back when the band were adamant that it wouldn't be released, so I knew what to expect, but it was great to see it in HD. It was interesting to see that the dance performances and cover songs were cut or just not focused on - I guess the band realised it was pretty weird as well. The show is impressive and interesting to watch with the orchestra, effects and staging. I loved hearing older songs like Candles, Our Solemn Hour and The Promise, and rare tracks like The Last Dance and Say My Name. Stairway to the Skies is a beautiful ending which really brings everything together.

After that, I found the *Hydra* side a bit of a let-down. If you've seen any show on the Hydra tour then there's not really any surprises. Sharon sounds quite tired and gets out of breath a lot - perhaps because it's the end of a long tour. I enjoyed Paradise, Silver Moonlight and Covered by Roses, but I felt a lot of the Hydra songs weren't very strong and some other tracks were repeats from the show we'd just watched. The choice to do 2 acoustic songs right at the end was a bit odd and slows the pace. It was a fun show overall, but perhaps not up to usual WT DVD standards. I guess that's why they added *Elements* to it. It's a shame this meant both shows had to be trimmed down a lot.

I would definitely recommend this DVD,  but I'd probably say to watch the *Hydra* side first and the more impressive *Elements* performance second."
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","I completely agree with you. Elements was such an amazing concert. It was a bit of a let down that they excluded ""Our Farewell"" from the track list, but other than that, it's close to reaching the quality of Black Symphony. As for Hydra, I just couldn't put myself to watch it past the first track, it doesn't seem to have that something that made their other concerts so special. "
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","Yeah it's quite a shame. You can at least watch the cut tracks from Elements on YouTube. I wasn't that keen on the guest singer for Our Farewell though, although she had a sweet voice - I think I would have preferred just Sharon."
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","I preferred the *Elements* side as well, largely because them playing with an orchestra makes it that much more awesome.  Would highly recommend watching it for anyone who hasn't.

On the *Hydra* side I thought the acoustic songs were alright, though when I saw them in Toronto in October they were only playing one acoustic song, which I think worked out a little better as it was a nice change of pace, but only a brief one.  Still a great show though, my personal favourites from that one would have to be In the Middle of the Night, Paradise, and Iron."
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","I sort of wondered why they left Iron and In The Middle of the Night on the Hydra DVD when they already had great performances of those songs on Elements. Those are 2 of my favourites as well, but if they'd cut them from Hydra we could have had one of the others back, like See Who I Am or The Cross or Our Farewell... "
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","Didn't think of that, would have been great to see a few older tracks in place of the songs that are on both.  Especially given that the versions on Hydra aren't as great as the Elements versions anyways"
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","How does it compare to Black Symphony? I really like their older stuff but I'm not a fan of their last two albums. Does Elements source songs from their whole discography? "
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","The Elements show has songs from their whole discography (it was recorded in 2012, so nothing from Hydra), and the Hydra side mostly has songs from the past two albums.  I'd say Elements is comparable to Black Symphony - also has an orchestra and is overall and awesome show, but Hydra (while still good) is definitely not as great."
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","It's mainly material from The Unforgiving album but on the DVD there's 1 song from THOE, 3 from TSF, 3 from Mother Earth and 1 from Enter. Unfortunately some of the other older stuff was cut for time, either because it's on the Hydra disc as well or because it's been on older live recordings. 

I would say I enjoyed Elements as much as Black Symphony - the only problem being that I'm a huge THOE fan so I did miss those songs. But I also really like The Unforgiving so it was very cool to see those songs performed with an orchestra. 
"
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","Damn. I was hoping to see a lot of ME and TSF stuff. I guess that makes sense, though. Black Symphony already covered a lot of THOE and previous so it would be logical to focus on The Unforgiving. 

I might pick up Let Us Burn if I come across it, but it's going to be hard to top Black Symphony for me. WT isn't even in my top five favorite bands, but I think that might be my favorite live DVD."
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","Have you got The Silent Force tour DVD? It's pretty epic, even though it doesn't have the orchestra etc. I think there was a Mother Earth one too, but I don't own that one."
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","Oooh, no. I'll have to get that at some point. I just watched a bit of it on YouTube and it sounds good. Thanks!"
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","I haven't seen it yet (though im in the front row of all 3 gigs), it has been purchased for me as a Christmas gift, so it'll be scheduled for festive viewing. Having been at the 3 shows, I felt that the concert was lacking that special feeling you get at a WT concert. It didn't seem like a WT show. It was visually impressive and we got Candles, but I hated the dancers, there was a lot of bloopers and the venue was meh. 
The Hydra shows were great though on a smaller scale, and her voice was tired, I enjoyed them a lot more. "
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","I wonder if those reasons you've mentioned could be why they didn't want to release the footage for so long. They certainly seem to have cut quite a lot of the not-very-WT things. I remember thinking when I watched it on YouTube that I couldn't believe they wasted time with 3 covers and all the dancing. I do actually quite like the covers but nowhere near as much as WT's own songs, and it seemed like it was more of a gimmick to get funding from Qmusic. I watched with a friend who's really into pop and even she thought the dancing was silly, especially because they were all just wearing shorts and t-shirts and looked like they'd forgotten to get dressed properly!

On the DVD though, they cut the covers and didn't show much of the dancing. For me the DVD version seemed a big improvement, it felt more like a real WT show. Hope you will enjoy it more too."
"Let Us Burn Discussion Thread","it seemed more like the realising of something Sharon wanted to do, but it didn't quite work...though Sharon still loves the concert. It wasn't going to be released at all, which is why it was shelved for so long. Her dress ripped halfway through a song, the pyro going off at the wrong time etc was all a bit farcical. The covers are songs Sharon genuinely loves too, but whoever felt those dancers were necessary  (maybe Ruud 😉) should have their head rapped off a wall!!!"

"So why did Amberian Dawn remake all their music with Heidi Parviainen?","With their recent album in july; it's kinda hard to listen to being a big fan of the old style. I don't think i'll be keeping it with my regular music."
"So why did Amberian Dawn remake all their music with Heidi Parviainen?","The way I see it, is that the way that the old songs were written and produced, Heidi's vocal range fit the part. However, Heidi's vocal range has been narrow at the times of recordings, and I can only assume that she left because she had no more to offer after The End of Eden and Circus Black.

When they hired Capri as replacement, in my opinion, they were looking for a different and more tough sound. Heidi couldn't achieve that. They rewrote some of the old songs to, maybe, showcase her voice as Capri's vocal range is wider and heavier (and a little more refined in my opinion).

However, I can understand why people don't like it. It's a large change to the lineup and writing style than what they're used to. Maybe when they come out with an album or two with Capri, you may be more impressed. Or not. Who knows?

I admire Capri's and Heidi's vocal talent. If I had to choose, though, I am a bigger fan of Capri's style and range."
"So why did Amberian Dawn remake all their music with Heidi Parviainen?","Yea she's not a bad singer and I would probably add different songs they do, but not the remakes. I can't listen to them without wanting to listen to the other version."
"So why did Amberian Dawn remake all their music with Heidi Parviainen?","I think they were mostly showcasing the new singer's voice, although I'm not a big fan of it. Hopefully it's better when the music's written for her but it seems like she has no range at all and almost has a lisp."
"So why did Amberian Dawn remake all their music with Heidi Parviainen?","I don't like to be too dramatic about this sort of thing, but honestly I thought it was quite insulting to Heidi to re-record the songs. But who knows, perhaps Heidi agreed that they could do it? In any case, I'll be sticking with the original versions, and I'm happy to listen to any new songs with Capri. She has a good rock voice."
"So why did Amberian Dawn remake all their music with Heidi Parviainen?","I absolutely love Capri's voice, it's more rock oriented.  No disrespect to Heidi, but I couldn't get into the band with the over the top dramatic operatic vocals.  I feel the same way about Nightwish, I prefer Anette and Floor."

"Sub-genres","I get a bit OCD when it comes to labeling my music correctly, and I've been stuck on quite a few of them...the one I can't figure out most would be Epica. I've seen them referred to as many different things, and they definitely have influences from Symphonic, Progressive, Gothic, and Power Metal all in one, which makes it difficult to call them one thing.

I'd like to be able to just call them Symphonic Gothic Metal (with obvious heavy Power Metal influences) but it feels kinda weird to put them into somewhat of the same category as a band like Sirenia.

There's some other bands I get stuck on, but they're either not in the Symph. category, or not worth the trouble debating. I just like to be able to call a band (or at least each of their albums) one thing, whenever it's within reason to do so (since many bands change their style up a lot)."
"Sub-genres","They aren't gothic. Like at all. Gothic is Type O Negative, Sirenia, Moonspell, Tristania, Draconian, all those. I would call them Symphonic, honestly. Just that. There are plenty of influences, but I don't feel like any of them make enough of an impact to bring them into another genre classification.

I'm super anal about my genres/subgenres/classification too :)"
"Sub-genres","I would just label Epica as symphonic, I think. They don't have many elements that strike me as particularly gothic or power metal these days, though they are fairly progressive. But in general I would just say they are a perfect example of a symphonic metal band."
"Sub-genres","Fair enough, I've done that with other bands too that don't really have a specific style to fit into (just labeling as Symphonic Metal, that is)."
"Sub-genres","I would definitely label Epica as Symphonic Power Metal. They are much more bombastic and fast paced than bands like Sirenia, Tristania and The Sins of Thy Beloved.

I'm working on several ways of categorizing symphonic metal, will hopefully get around to finishing and posting it within a couple of weeks."
"Sub-genres","That's pretty awesome, feel free to message me with questions/ideas because I'm trying to do the same, as I mentioned. Simply because I like to try to compare music, and it's not fair to compare a catchy pop song by Maroon 5 (yes, I admit to liking pop as well &gt;.&gt;) to a song by Sirenia or Epica."
"Sub-genres","Best descriptor (IMO) for Epica is Symphonic Progressive Metal. 

Sums up most of their discography, I think, and even though some of their more recent work has a few death metal elements (Martyr of the Free Word and Kingdom of Heaven, for example), it's not enough to make them a Symphonic Progressive Death Metal band (heh). 

That would be MaYaN, actually."

The Haunting (Somewhere in Time), March of Mephisto, Abandoned

Ghost Opera, The Human Stain

The Great Pandemonium, The Zodiac, Necropolis, My Train of Thought

Sacrimony (Angel of Afterlife)

I'm looking for more songs by them, as I am trying to get back into them. What would you recommend?"
"Kamelot Recommendations","first off, invest in **The Black Halo**. it's an absolute masterpiece from start to finish. I couldn't pick and choose off that album and just have to say get the whole thing.

from their newer albums, starting with **Silverthorn** go with ""Ashes to Ashes"", ""Torn"", Song for Jolie"", ""Veritas"", ""My Confession"", and the titletrack.

**Poetry for the Poisoned** is a fairly weak album, the only songs I'd recommend off of it (not counting the ones you named) would ""If Tomorrow Came"", ""Hunter's Season"", ""Seal of Woven Years"", and ""Once Upon A Time"".

**Ghost Opera**? I have 3 words for you. Rule The World. Beyond that go with the title track, ""Love You To Death"", ""Mourning Star"", and ""Edenecho"".
 
further back, for **Epica** I'd go with ""Center of the Universe"", ""Farewell"", ""Wander"", ""On The Coldest Winder Night"", and the bonus track ""Like The Shadows"".

from **Karma**, go with ""Forever"", ""The Spell"", ""Don't You Cry"", ""Karma"", ""Across The Highlands"", and the Elizabeth Bathory trilogy

**Fourth Legacy** I'd go with the title track, ""Nights of Arabia"", ""A Sailorman's Hymn"", and ""Alexandria""."
"Kamelot Recommendations","All of this, definitely."
"Kamelot Recommendations","The Black Halo is one of the few albums ever made that I would consider a masterpiece. It is the centerfold of any Kamelot collection. That said, almost everything by Kamelot is fantastic. You cannot go wrong."
"Kamelot Recommendations","My absolute favorite song of theirs is Center of the Universe.  I would say to pick up the One Cold Winter's Night DVD or soundtrack on iTunes, or check out the performances on Youtube.  The entire concert is gold and I honestly prefer those live tracks over their recorded versions.

Just looking at what you have already, you might like:
- Center of the Universe
- Rule the World
- Eden Echo
- When the Lights Are Down
- Memento Mori (starts slow and builds to epicness)
- Elizabeth I, II, III (starts slow and builds to epicness)
- Forever
- Karma
- Hunter's Season
- Solitaire
- My Confession
- III Ways to Epica
- The Fourth Legacy
- Once Upon a Time

(Most of their slower stuff is ridiculously beautiful)
- Don't You Cry
- A Sailorman's Hymn
- Season's End
- House on a Hill

...I really like Kamelot."
"Kamelot Recommendations","So from what I can tell of this thread, essentially, buy all the albums. They're all good."
"Kamelot Recommendations","Pretty much, if your subbed to this subreddit I would almost consider Kamelot required listening. They really don't make a bad album in general and I'm so glad to see that the band is still picking up steam after the departure of Roy Khan. Sad to be missed but Tommy Karevik is a worthy successor."
"Kamelot Recommendations","Don't but the first two. Start with The Fourth Legacy. Skip Poetry for the Poisoned. "
"Kamelot Recommendations","So start when Roy joined the band and skip Poetry for the Poisoned. "
"Kamelot Recommendations","I think a lot of their albums are worth listening to (especially Karma, Epica, The Black Halo and Silverthorn), but if I had to pick a favorite Kamelot track, it'd probably be Memento Mori from The Black Halo.

Also the Elizabeth song trilogy from Karma, which is pretty awesome."
"Kamelot Recommendations","I like to direct people to go back to the Fourth Legacy because it shows their roots, and makes the development through the albums more interesting.  In that sense, if you're looking at getting into Kamelot as a band, rather than hearing a few songs, starting at Fourth Legacy and moving forward to Ghost Opera would tap into what I think of as the core transformation of Kamelot from Power Metal into more Progressive Metal as time goes on."
"Kamelot Recommendations","The Black Halo is probably my favourite by them. I really like Soul Society and Memento Mori."
"Kamelot Recommendations","I would recommend going album by album starting with the Fourth Legacy, at least through the Roy Khan era (that would be through Poetry for the Poisoned, although really I would recommend Fourth Legacy, Epica, Karma, Black Halo most strongly)."
"Kamelot Recommendations","I'd say everything.  After seeing them in concert right after Roy (sad)  they had fabio Leone as the singer it was fabulous! And the new album comes out May 5th!"
"Kamelot Recommendations","Artists such as Kamelot put a lot of work into making a whole concept or theme (rather than a collection of random songs) for each album release. So I'd recommend you pick an album and spend an hour with it. Don't try to piece together a ""best of"" collection of individual songs."
"Kamelot Recommendations","All of the Roy Khan albums (except for Poetry For The Poisoned, which I found weak, comparetively, to earlier albums), most definitely. I haven't listened to Silverthorn nearly as much as I should be, because Tommy doesn't have the same vocal timbre (in my opinion) as Roy did."
"Kamelot Recommendations","Epica and The Black Halo are one continuous story. Some songs are better than others in terms of individual sound, but it's totally worth it to read up on the plot of the story, and then listen all the way through, trying to follow things as they happen.

In terms of individual songs, a few excellent ones that you haven't listed: Center of the Universe, III Ways To Epica, Serenade, Snow, and Wander/On The Coldest Winter Night if you like the softer stuff like Abandoned."
"Kamelot Recommendations","My favorite track by them is probably The Black Halo from the album of the same name. The whole album is definitely worth listening to, though."

"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","Just wondering how everyone else does with this. It's probably not a big problem if you live in Finland or Sweden, but I'm in North America and get weird looks when someone asks me what I'm into or listening to. Doesn't help that I'm male and don't really look ""goth"" or anything. I get stuff like:

Them: What are you up to this weekend?

Me: Going to a concert

Them: Cool! Who are you going to see?

Me: Um, (Within Temptation / Nightwish / whoever)

Them: Oh.. um never heard of them. What are they like?

Me: It's symphonic heavy metal

Them: ? (weird looks) I'm not sure what that is....

Me: It's heavy metal with operatic singing (or extreme choir, or some other lame explanation...)

Them: Oh I see... so like Evanescence...

Me: Um, not exactly, but kinda that direction...

It's rare that I get any more questions, the topic is mostly avoided after that. And if you're in a situation where people are playing music like a party, whatever you do don't put on your stuff if they're listening to White Stripes or Lamb of God or Linkin Park or some shit (although I do like me some LoG once in a while). 

Do you think this is an acquired taste? Or did you have an ""a-ha"" moment when you heard it? For me it was ""wow, where has this been all my life"", but the others just don't seem to get it. Which explains why I have to travel fairly far for concerts that are 2000 people or less. Sigh."
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","I think that a lot of people haven't been properly exposed to classical music or opera. I think this is even true for some metalheads. Metalheads are some of the most elitist assholes and are not open to expanding their listening to other music. When I was growing up, my mom would listen to a bunch of operas (like The Phantom of the Opera and Les Misérables) and I even saw them live as a child. I didn't really listen to classical music that much growing up but I would definitely use it when I would study because it helped me stay calm and relaxed so I learned to really appreciate the beauty of orchestrations and choirs.  

Metal, on the other hand, I have been a fan of for a long time. I started listening to thrash and death metal at an early age and then branched out to power, prog, folk, symphonic, etc. When most people hear ""metal"" I think they automatically think of brutal fucking metal that's going to eat your guts out, and that's not always the case. So right off the bat, people view metal as being somewhat taboo.  

TL;DR I don't think many people appreciate classical music and have a negative connotation of metal. So together they can't grasp the concept of symphonic metal. Just my opinion."
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","&gt; When most people hear ""metal"" I think they automatically think of brutal fucking metal that's going to eat your guts out

When you take this into account, hearing the term ""symphonic metal"" is almost an oxymoron. How can such scary music be mashed up with something traditionally known to be refined and formal?"

"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","Shit is awesome. Hadn't heard that Epica song before."
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","Lori Lewis' intro to Scharzalbenheim is incredible."
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","I usually describe symphonic metal to people by saying it's basically a metal subgenre that adds elements of orchestral and classical music, usually with female vocals and choirs.

Like a mix of the beauty of classical/orchestral stuff with the brutality and intensity of metal music (which in itself is related to the whole symphonic/gothic metal concept of the ""Beauty and the Beast"" vocal approach)."
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","I usually just tell them it's opera music played with guitars and electric bass. They seem to get that. If they're more interested I'd go into it deeper, but so far that hasn't happened. :/"
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","Speaking of that A-Ha! moment.  Mine was when Metallica of all bands released  the S&amp;M album.  Orchestra and Metal, together?  Holy fuck!

You could almost use that example of a gateway album.  Even people who do not know metal know Metallica.

Or you can just say it's metal + Orchestra (Like an awesome film or game soundtrack) + Opera style singing (like Phantom of the Opera).

I personally wouldn't use the Evanescence example, but that's more of a pet peeve of mine, more than anything."
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","I've had very mixed results in the UK! Depends who you're talking to, I guess. People I meet in metal pubs/clubs would generally know the main bands, but sometimes they've been quite rude about it - one time a guy asked me who my favourite band were. I said Nightwish. He actually turned around and walked away. Lovely...

Generally if people don't know the genre at all, I go with ""it's a bit like Evanescence"". Most people get the idea then. If they're more interested I might explain properly, but otherwise I just leave it at that.

I try not to judge how people will react beforehand, though. My editor totally surprised me this week by saying she knew Nightwish and enjoyed watching them at a festival. Equally I met a couple of people in uni that I would never have guessed were fans. That's always a nice surprise! 

"
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","In the Netherlands we are lucky because pretty much everyone here knows Within Temptation. Then again, I always feel the need to follow it up by explaining that there are (imo) far superior symphonic metal bands."
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","Man, you think symphonic metal is hard to describe? Try art metal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46U2y-lO344

As for the ""don't try and make people listen to this if they're listening to x"", well.. some music is acquired taste, some not. I wouldn't expect most people to like Kamelot, I can think of a few Epica songs a lot would like. You can put some shit on like Metallica S&amp;M album and most people who are into metal will like that. It varies, not all symphonic metal is the same after all!"
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","Oh yeah, avant-garde stuff can be pretty mindboggling. UnExpect and some Diablo Swing Orchestra stuff mix so many diverse musical elements that it's tricky to define their style in a general way."

Psychic Jugglers  
Silence 011010701"
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","I LOVE Unexpect. Never heard the term 'art metal' before - but I guess you're not wrong."
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","That and ""avant-garde metal"" are the terms I've heard describe it. Art metal sounds a bit less pretentious though, heh."
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","I'm pretty sure they both sound pretentious. Then again, when you're trying to discuss *any* metal subgenre with an outsider you sound pretentious. Doesn't stop the music from being excellent though."
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","I already liked orchestral music and i had a stupid emo phase in high school so I had no aversion to symphonic metal at all. Even with harsh vocals. My friends that i introduced the music to all loved it. I suck at describing things but i just let them listen (force them to listen to my cds while in my car) and the music speaks for itself. Then i drag them to shows with me and it's always been a positive experience :) "
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","I just link them songs"
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","It is definitely hard to introduce people to the genre. I think the best idea is to sort of gradually bring them on board. You don't want to just shove them into the deepest depths of symphonic metal that we are all comfortable with, you want to introduce the elements that make the genre unique little by little. 

For example, though I love these videos equal amounts (but differently), I would start people with something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDkaKpoFJV4) instead of something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmLIE6ULtyU)."
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","That's actually kinda odd. *Ice Queen* is massively more popular among the non-symphonic-metal-listening audience than anything by Epica is. I find Within Temptation much more accessible than Epica!

(For example, in the annual Dutch public radio's top 2000 *Ice Queen* is the highest ranked symphonic metal song...at place 216.)"
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","I am not a metal fan, but I enjoy a few bands from here or there. I got there by giving different bands a chance open mindedly at different times. Still not a fan, but now I can listen to nightwish or dragonforce or fear before or etc. I find most people hear metal and get a negative view in their mind and dont know what to do from there. They have only ever heard bad metal and never given it an open minded chance. 

Hey to them your metal might be the bad metal and they might love evanescence. Gotta admit I enjoy the first cd still =)"
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","After I introduced someone to Abney Park (not making that part up), they told me to listen to Nightwish. I listened to The Poet and the Pendulum, thought (originally - its one of my favorite songs now) it was ok, then the same friend told me specifically to listen to Storytime (and Imaginaerum in general) and that was basically it."
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","I just explain that symphonic metal is like orchestral music and metal having a baby.

The problem may be in mentioning 'heavy', so people have a skewed perception of it even before you start explaining."
"Ever have trouble explaining this music to anyone?","I hate to say it, but I generally just say something to the effect of  ""kinda like Evanescence but better."" Its really the best example I can use for someone who has no idea what the hell I am talking about. Makes it even more difficult if its a band who has operatic singing AND death vocals...so Evanescence mixed with death metal is a...difficult concept to explain to most people."
"New Nightwish single elan, thoughts?","So the new Nightwish single from their new album was released today, what does everyone think of it so far?"
"New Nightwish single elan, thoughts?","I have heard the whole album and this's definitely the most ""radio friendly"" song on it. It's not really a true representation of the album as it is so dynamic and ambitious it's almost like a punch to the face!!! "
"New Nightwish single elan, thoughts?","The pipes are perfect, so beautiful. But, I did find most other parts of the song to be a bit boring. It never hit in a satisfying way for me, especially the chorus, just staying soft and smooth. Not really my thing.

Overall, it won't be my favourite song and I probably won't listen to it that much, but I still think it bodes well for the full album, with Floor's voice shining so well. I'm excited!"
"New Nightwish single elan, thoughts?","Very different from Imaginaerum, I think it has a touch of the older stuff which is totally not what I was expecting, but I like it anyway! Can't wait to hear the rest of it."
"New Nightwish single elan, thoughts?","The intro melody and chord progression is giving me a very strong Amorphis vibe, especially [Heaven of my Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtdfQPEjTRw)

As far as the song itself - I think it makes sense as the first single. Catchy, short, accessible. That said, I really like it and it has definitely gotten me more excited for the album! I like how Floor pulls back and isn't required to belt everything at 110%. "
"New Nightwish single elan, thoughts?","I really like it.  I want to hear her belting it out live.  After seeing the Wacken 2013 clips I fell in love lol.  All it's missing is a guitar solo :)

Definitely got me excited for the new album."
"New Nightwish single elan, thoughts?","I'm on my second listen. The verses are really lovely - they've made the best of Floor's soft vocals. The chorus isn't getting me yet but I've heard that it gets stuck in your head. I don't think this is going to be a big hit but it's certainly a sweet and enjoyable song."
"New Nightwish single elan, thoughts?","Bought it on iTunes and had a listen. Gave me goosebumps although I think part of that came from the thrill of listening to it after all the anticipation and waiting for it.

I honestly do like it though.

I get the feeling that it was chosen as the first release specifically to put the new members of the band forward. Of course, Floor Jansen is front and center. Troy's pipes are an integral part of the song but you can hear him doing backing vocals as well. Absolutely no complaints about Kai Hahto's drumming.

I'm looking forward to the full album."
"New Nightwish single elan, thoughts?","Instrumentally it's insanely boring, just muted chords through the entire song, bass doing nothing extra, really vanilla drum beat and synth not really bringing much to the table. 

I get the idea, calm collected song that's showing off the soft side of both the band and the new singer but I'm not really feeling anything special with this song. There's nothing extra, it's just simple and plain all throughout the entire song. I kept expecting it to go that extra bit towards the end and really bring it but nope, just another soft chorus where they barely made the effort to spice it up a bit.

Maybe it's just serving it's spot as a soft filler as some have said but man.. It's a really bland and boring song and I really hope the rest of the album really is as different and interesting as the people who got a taste of it says.

"Epica - Nostalgia","It's a shame that Twin Flames isn't included on the European version! It's such a beautiful song, possibly even my favorite from RFTI."
"Epica - Nostalgia","Twin Flames is also my favorite from RFTI. In my opinion, the regular version is better than the soundtrack version."
"Epica - Nostalgia","I hadn't heard the regular version before, but I just found it on youtube. You're right, it is also really pretty. I think I prefer the soundtrack version more overall though, just because the orchestra part is a lot less ""busy"". I like the more laid back and chill feeling in the soundtrack version."
"Epica - Nostalgia","By the ""regular version"", do you guys mean the one that was performed at Retrospect? None of the Twin Flames results on my youtube search distinguishes as to whether it's the soundtrack or regular versions."
"Epica - Nostalgia","Wikipedia says the ""regular version"" was a bonus track on a certain version of the album, and that it was about 15 seconds shorter, so that's how I found it. Search for ""twin flames epica"" and look for one that's like 4:45 instead of 5:00."
"Epica - Nostalgia","[Found it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQd7mmE9mHY), thanks!

"NIGHTWISH - Making of new album 2015; Episode 5 (OFFICIAL TRAILER)","Nightwish was one of my all-time favorite bands. Once Anette joined, I stopped listening. I never bashed her but she just didn't do it for me. Once Floor joint, I didn't even know since I removed myself from anything to do with the band since it was just a Anette vs Tarja with fans. It's like Gabriel and Collins all over again and I don't like that.

But once I did stumble upon Nightwish with the new singer, Floor. I was ""Floored"" &gt;.&lt; I honestly thinks she fits better than Tarja ever did. She performs amazing live compared to Anette or Tarja and is just so powerful in every aspect. Anyways I can't wait to hear what is next!"
"NIGHTWISH - Making of new album 2015; Episode 5 (OFFICIAL TRAILER)","I don't know many symphonic metal fans, but do people actually think Anette is a better fit for Nightwish than Tarja? That is just downright idiotic. "
"NIGHTWISH - Making of new album 2015; Episode 5 (OFFICIAL TRAILER)","Very few people ever said that Anette was better than Tarja, usually just the other way around. But a lot of people (myself included) were perfectly happy with Anette as the singer at the time (and I certainly know a whole bunch of people who preferred her, especially if they didn't like operatic vocals). Tuomas once described Tarja's voice as like a ""cold mountain stream"" while Anette was like a ""warm storyteller"". That was a great analogy for me. I enjoyed them both equally.

Having said that, Floor is my favourite vocalist now, hands down."

"Delain UK dates announced: Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow","When asked about the lack of show in London, Delain replied on Twitter to ""stay tuned"" so it looks like there may yet be a show announced there.

I do wonder (and I have no evidence for this!) if they might support Epica, who are playing a London show shortly after and haven't yet got support. Dagoba are supporting them everywhere else except London."
"Delain UK dates announced: Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow","&gt;they might support Epica

Oh man that'd be awesome."
"Delain UK dates announced: Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow","I know Epica are older and have more albums, but I don't think they are so much 'bigger' than Delain to justify having them support them. Co-headline maybe.  "
"Delain UK dates announced: Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow","Not sure if I'd bother seeing them in London. I love them but I recently saw them do a great set supporting Within Temptation at Wembley."
"Delain UK dates announced: Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow","That's actually a reason why I'm really excited about it, I was supposed to see them support WT but I got ill when I got there and missed the whole of Delain's set.

"[Symphonic Black Friday] Arcturus - Wintry Grey - [4:36]","This sub gets little symphonic black in general so I took liberty of posting two songs today.

Some trivia: Although Therion's Theli is perhaps the most commonly referred ""starting point"" for the symphonic metal 
as a genre, within the symphonic black niche things were already going on during that time. Aspera Hiems Symfonia 
album, from which this particular song is taken, was released in June 1996 (so three months before Theli) and some 
obscure acts can be dated even further back. However, they were all performed in a relative isolation and their 
influence on other bands was minimal when compared to the big early trio of Therion/Nightwish/Within Temptation, 
which is probably the reason why there are rarely considered canon (from the symphonic point of view). "

"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Thrash metal has their big 4. What symphonic metal bands would make up the big 4 of symphonic metal?"
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","I've always thought of it as a big 3 including Epica, Nightwish, and Within Temptation."
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","I'd add Therion in there, too, with all of their pioneering 1990s work and the sheer amount of albums they've put out since."
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Yeap, same here"
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","as much as i agree that within temptation is a symphonic metal band, i just don't find them to be a good representation.

there's just something about them that is...off

i guess that's a personal opinion though"
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Well according to Last.fm the top 4 are Nightwish, Therion, Epica and Within Temptation.

http://i.imgur.com/lSLTwiV.jpg"
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Epica, Nightwish, Kamelot, After Forever."
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","THIS! Within Temptation doens't belong with them. These ARE the big four."
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","My call would be Nightwish, Within Temptation, Epica, After Forever.

However, I think that Xandria, Delain, Within Temptation, and Lacuna Coil more adequately cover the genre."
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","I adore Lacuna Coil but I don't think they're symphonic metal. They don't really use any symphonic elements. As for the others, all good picks!"
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Sonata Arctica, Xandria, Delain.  On tour."
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Yep, I'm planning on seeing them in Denver on October 4!"
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","I think most people will answer Nightwish, Epica and Within Temptation! So if there had to be a fourth band it would be debatable. According to Google, Rhapsody of Fire is the 4th most popular, followed by Therion and Kamelot."
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Lets just have a ""Big 12"" and get all who deserve :P"
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Haha yes, good idea!"
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Epica and Nightwish. The rest is debatable, but I'd answer Kamelot and Rhapsody since I'm more on the power metal side of the spectrum."
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Honestly, since symphonic metal has exploded in popularity within the last 10-15 years, I'd say it's hard to pinpoint a Big 4. A number of bands deserve it, and each with their own reasons and the wide spectrum of musical styles. The biggest influences are obvious; Epica, Nightwish, Therion, Kamelot, Rhapsody of Fire, Within Temptation, and quite a few others. They've all helped this genre grow."
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Nightwish, Apocalyptica, Epica and Within Temptation.

They are the four biggest and most talked about bands. Even if you think one or more of these are not that good, everyone you talk to will have an opinion on all these bands."
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Apocalyptica? Seriously?"
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","I'd say Within Temptation, Nightwish, Edenbridge, Amberian Dawn imo"
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Mate, what were you *thinking*, you didn't reply with the same bands as everyone else did!"
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","[deleted]"
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","Nightwish, Delain, Kamelot, and Within Temptation."
"Big 4 of Symphonic Metal?","The sins of thy beloved, Tristania, Sirenia and Trail of Tears. I know they do not meet your requirements, but my top 4 without question. Good old gothic classics that will never die.

Big 4? Nightwish, Epica, Within Temptation, the last one is kinda hard. As mentioned before I think Lacuna coil or Delain could fill that last spot. I've just mentioned bands with female vocalists though to make it ""easy""."
"Crysalys - Lilium",""
"XANDRIA - Dreamkeeper",""
"XANDRIA - Dreamkeeper","Ok, I loved the last album, it is one of my favorite symphonic metal albums.

This is mediocre at best. The chorus is bland, the guitars are too quiet, the lyrics are generic and I'm sorry to say but the new singer isn't as powerful as Manuela.

Let's hope the rest of the album is better, as they claim."
"XANDRIA - Dreamkeeper","This sounds a lot like their older stuff, which I was not overly fond of (I mean it was good... but lacked something) It's too muted.

I really hope, as Timmy said, that it gets more complex and powerful in the album as promised. "
"XANDRIA - Dreamkeeper","From their coming album, Sacrificium, featuring their new singer Dianne Van Giersbergen after the departure of Manuela Kraller. 

Here's the band's blurb for the song:
&gt;""DREAMKEEPER"" represents the melodic side of ""Sacrificium"" and will be your 'first steps' into our new album! It will lure you into a much darker, heavier and more complex universum that will be revealed to you through the other “Sacrificium”-songs! Enjoy ""Dreamkeeper"" and brace yourself for more!


Though Dreamkeeper is nice, I certainly hope the other pieces get more complex as promised!"
"XANDRIA - Dreamkeeper","It seems strange that they've had to say this, as if they know it's not as good as the other stuff as well (there is a sample on their [Napalm Records page](http://shop.napalmrecords.com/xandria) which sounds a little more like Neverworld's End). I wonder if the record company asked them to do this one first or something."
"Epica Sheet Music","I play the clarinet and I was wondering if any of you had sheet music for any Epica songs. I would just love to pay to many songs that Epica has made over the past years. Piano sheet music would be fine as well, I can transpose that for my instrument."
"Epica Sheet Music","Just search 'Epica sheet music' on google. The first result (jellynote.com) has nearly every song."
"Epica Sheet Music","The issue is that it is scores for the songs. Its great for more than on person, but this is just me. I don't want to shift though 9 or so parts condensing the melody into one cohesive piece. Anywhere I can find this?"
"Epica Sheet Music","[shred those riffs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGgcAhBbLsU) "
"Within Temptation - Silver Moonlight (Demo Version)",""
"Within Temptation - Silver Moonlight (Demo Version)","These demo's really give me hope for the new Within Temptation album! *[Let Us Burn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbYyewNk1yI)* is great too. Together with Nightwish this was the band that got me into symphonic metal in the first place. 

In my opinion their greatest days were at the very beginning. *Enter*, *The Dance* and especially parts of *[Mother Earth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YbhB_A_8fM)* were amazing. *[The Silent Force](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOYgWyZ4Qz8)* and *[The Heart of Everything](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICAORuEmO6U)* have brilliant songs too. 

Then it started going downhill. I wasn't blown away by *Black Symphony*, and didn't like the *Acoustic* album, *The Unforgiven* and especially not the *Q-Music Sessions* (covers). 

When they released [*Paradise (What About Us?)*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy6MpsDPKts) with Tarja I was pleasantly surprised. The demo's on the EP are great. Too bad [their new single](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAiV8RpqzME) isn't."
"Within Temptation - Silver Moonlight (Demo Version)","Agreed, but I'm still dreading some of the tracks on the new album. "
"Within Temptation - Silver Moonlight (Demo Version)","I think you are right about most of the things, but for me Paradise is so bland, generic and awkward. Sharon's and Tarja's voice don't resonate very good for me."
"Within Temptation - Silver Moonlight (Demo Version)","As someone who grew to love *The Unforgiving* as much as the rest of WT's back catalogue, I actually think the EP songs are a direct continuation of that style (which I view as rather unique and epic symphonic rock). This song is probably the most similar to their old style given Robert's harsh vocals and how Sharon is singing, but I'm not sure if that will still be evident on the final album.

I'm definitely looking forward to *Hydra*, though I expect it will take a while to get into. I particularly loved *Paradise* and the EP songs, but *Dangerous* hasn't caught me at all so far. I'm actually really interested to hear the song with Xzibit, I like the fact that they're experimenting with something totally out of the box. But in general the best songs on WT's albums are the ones that don't get released as singles, so I'm looking forward to those."
"Within Temptation - Silver Moonlight (Demo Version)","After a couple of listens i can say that i really like it, though i would like it even more without the growls."

"Easiest Epica songs to play on 7-string guitar?","So I just got my seven string for Christmas, and Epica is my favorite band. Part of the reason I wanted the 7 as opposed to 6 string is so I can play Epica's music and other similar bands (e.g. MaYaN) that use the low B string. Do any of you Epica fans play their music on guitar? What are the easiest songs to start learning?

(I started with Consign to Oblivion but got hung up at the short instrumental part right before ""Open your eyes..."" etc; I need a new song to start working on until I'm good enough to tackle CTO!) "
"Easiest Epica songs to play on 7-string guitar?","What would you say your guitar playing ability is at? I bought my seven string solely for playing epica related songs also :P"
"Easiest Epica songs to play on 7-string guitar?","Guitar-wise I'm a relative beginner... however, I have been playing keyboard and composing for 6-7 years, so I don't have any problems reading sheet music/tabs or understanding chords. I got stuck at the fast part in ""Consign to Oblivion"" because my fingers just aren't fast enough on guitar to do that. So I don't think I could tackle songs like ""Monopoly on Truth,"" ""Deter the Tyrant"" etc. that have a lot of fast left-hand work. I am able to alternate-pick though so the fast parts as in ""Dance of Fate"" where the picking is the only fast thing are not too bad. "
"Easiest Epica songs to play on 7-string guitar?","Yeah with a lot of epica songs you'll find the right hand strumming is trickier than the left so it's good if you can strum fast. Try songs (keeping to the fast strumming theme) like menace of vanity, last crusade, quietus, death of a dream (tricky but fun), never enough, cry for the moon, seif Al din (another trickier one), burnt to a cinder. Hope you manage to work those out. Those are the ones I consider the most fun that aren't too technically difficult. Good luck! Tell me how they go :)"
"Easiest Epica songs to play on 7-string guitar?","Thanks... I hadn't thought about burn to a cinder and haven't even listened to menace of vanity for a long time and did not think of quietus either. I actually learned most of Never Enough yesterday and the day before... Not my favorite Epica song but still good and probably the easiest one I could think of. Death of a Dream is one of my favorites so if it's not too hard I might like playing that... same with Last Crusade... probably the two most choir-centric Epica songs. Thanks for the tips! 

Actually looking through the Jellynote.com website (which has free Epica sheet music and tabs) I just found that Martyr of the Free Word is really fast but does not seem to have too many hard left-hand parts (if I exclude the solo that is). "
"Easiest Epica songs to play on 7-string guitar?","Hey, actually Martyr was way too hard to play full speed. I pretty much can play Never Enough and Cry for the Moon... just need a little more work on the fast picking in the latter to keep up with the song. "
"Easiest Epica songs to play on 7-string guitar?","Hi! Sorry for such a late reply. Yeah Martyr is hard, especially the solo. I've been learning Kingdom of heaven pt 1 which is probably on the same difficulty as Marty's in areas, but it's really fun. I'd give that a go. The lead is quite hard, but the rhythm guitar which is what Mark is playing should be managable. Beyond belief is another one that's not too hard (excluding the solo)"
"Easiest Epica songs to play on 7-string guitar?","Wow... KOH... that would be a fun one to play - but probably beyond my level right now. I think I've realized about Epica's music that the guitar parts were easier before Issac joined them... The first album especially seems to not have many super-difficult parts. I finally played the fast part of Cry for the Moon at full tempo and now am working on Sensorium. Not much hard left-hand work there but some fast picking. I would agree that Mark's parts are generally a lot easier than Issac's. I notice him making some mistakes at the live concerts I watch on YouTube... probably having to growl and guitar at the same time is hard for him... I think he's a better composer than performer, but his growls are beast on the albums. "

"The Birdcage - a symphonic metal album as a video game (Indiegogo)","Does anyone have any thoughts on how they might execute the final product? I have two concerns based on what I'm seeing here. 

The first is that the trailer didn't have even a demo version of something that would match the final audio based on the description. 

The second is the gameplay and how it would work. I think that this is an idea worth exploring, but I'm having trouble imagining what a truly integrated video game and concept album would look like based on only the written/spoken description. IMHO the trailer didn't look much different from a plain old fashioned video game trailer. 

Does anyone have any thoughts? Did I miss something on the page? Is there a similar idea floating around (or finished) that I should check out for a better idea?
"
"The Birdcage - a symphonic metal album as a video game (Indiegogo)","I completely agree, I don't feel like I really understand anything about the gameplay from what they've said. I'm not entirely sure why they labelled the trailer as ""gameplay"" when that's not what it is at all. I always want to encourage these kinds of ideas but I don't think they've given out enough to make people really invest in it.

I'm also rather wondering if the audience is big enough. Brutal Legend did fairly well as a game because it covered lots of aspects of rock and metal as well as being very funny and having a famous actor (Jack Black) in the lead. I struggle to see The Birdcage appealing to many people outside of symphonic metal fans.

Karmaflow which was linked above is the only other similar idea that I know of. If you watch the videos it makes a bit more sense as to how the music is integrated into their game (basically the bosses singing the plot at you) but it shares the same problems with audience etc."

* There are only six different bands in the top 25.

* Nightwish and Epica are dominant with 9 and 8 songs respectively. They are followed by Kamelot (3 songs), then Delain and Within Temptation (both 2 songs). Tarja has one song in the list, but it is a Gary Moore song covered by Nightwish and not a track from her solo career.

* There are 5 collaborations in the list: Within Temptation feat. Tarja (*Paradise*), Delain feat. Marco Hietala (*Your Body Is a Battleground*), Kamelot feat. Simone Simons (*The Haunting*), Kamelot feat. Elize Ryd (*Veritas*) and Tarja feat. Floor Jansen (*Over the Hills and Far Away*).

* There are 5 live performances in the list.

* There are 2 covers in the list: Epica's *Imperial March*, and Tarja's version of *Over the Hills and Far Away*.

* Two songs are listed multiple times. One is *Ghost Love Score* by Nightwish, with a live version, an instrumental version and the original album version. The other is Epica's recent single *The Essence of Silence*, of which the first link got deleted from YouTube and the later link was the official lyrics video.

* Surprisingly absent is Nightwish's [live version of *Ghost Love Score* in Buenos Aires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brcfttchzA). There are three other versions of this song in the list, but this performance is widely regarded as the best.

* If the list were expanded to a top 40 it would include these currently unlisted bands: Luca Turilli, Evanescence, Tuomas Holopainen, Xandria, Turisas and Diablo Swing Orchestra. In that order.

* The biggest symphonic metal band that does not make the top 40 is Leaves' Eyes, which really surprised me. Their most upvoted song is [*Symphony of the Night*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AOVC030DoY) ([thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/symphonicmetal/comments/1tn4my/leaves_eyes_symphony_of_the_night/)).

* A number of other successful bands didn't make the top 40, but there are probable explanations for those. Tristania for example is generally considered gothic rather than symphonic metal, and their recent albums are much less symphonic than their earlier ones."

"The 25 most upvoted songs on this subreddit","See, I prefer this one (Wacken). It has a more satisfying build up to the finale."
"The 25 most upvoted songs on this subreddit","I've heard the Wacken one too, the guitar solo is also better in the Wacken version. 

I just like the Buenos Aires one significantly better for multiple factors. One of them is just the crowd noises in the background, for instance. Another is just how Floor sang the very last bit of it. I'm not sure that was rehearsed, I think it just came out that way that day, and everyone was blown away. (I could be wrong about that) I remember tearing up a little bit the first time I heard it. That definitely did not get to me in the same way on the Wacken version. It was still good, probably better in most technical aspects, but one of the best things about the Buenos Aires one is that it was just very genuine. I could probably write a whole 5-page paper on this... I'll spare you :) "

"The 25 most upvoted songs on this subreddit","Three is what was stuck in my head, but maybe I'm off by one.


I got a chuckle out of Floor's 'setlist' they put up for her.  Instead of the usual simple set list (I actually have Emmpu's setlist from that show), hers was a full set of lyrics--a taped up grid of about 12 sheets of paper--completely covering the monitor and down onto the floor.


Unlike the setlists, they did not hand that one out to the audience...rats."

"The 25 most upvoted songs on this subreddit","It's a shame but not a surprise considering that their best albums are all 10+ years old, and their more recent releases have had mixed receptions from fans (although I really liked Gothic Kabbalah). They've also not had any news with regards to new material yet, plus they're not as commercially successful as Nightwish, Within Temptation and Epica."
"The 25 most upvoted songs on this subreddit","You're absolutely right, Therion's best stuff is much older than this subreddit. I didn't like *Gothic Kabbalah*, but I do think *Live Gothic* was amazing. Their best line-up so far."
"The 25 most upvoted songs on this subreddit","The sub is three years old :) there has been quite a lot of Therion posted, but they're not upvoted quite as much as the bands listed at the top."
"The 25 most upvoted songs on this subreddit","Ooh, interesting! Thanks for putting this together. I would've guessed Ghost Love Score as the favourite - I suppose having three entries, it probably is the most upvoted overall. I'm also surprised that the Buenos Aires one didn't make it in, as it's my favourite performance, and the crowd really add to the atmosphere in that one.

In general, I can see there's a preference for things that have been new singles/official videos since the subreddit's been going, which makes sense."

"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","I often times see symphonic bands with the label of gothic metal. I've seen Within Temptation, Epica, Delain, Xandria, etc. all labeled as gothic metal at one point or another. Is there a distinction between the two genres or are they kinda related? When I think of ""gothic"" I think of bands like H.I.M., Lacuna Coil, Evanescence, etc. "
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","It's probably somewhat contentious, but since there's no official Dictionary of Metal, this is how I see it:
They're not mutually exclusive. One refers to instrumentation, the other refers to overall theme/style. Symphonic metal contains, well, symphonic elements - sounds that you would hear in a symphony, like violins, cellos, trumpets, etc. These sounds can be produced by electronic keyboard (as they usually are for practical and budgetary reasons) or actual ""real"" orchestral instruments.

Gothic metal can (and often do) include symphonic sounds (perhaps most notably organs) but describes a darker style of sound and lyrical theme. 

If I were to categorize them relative to each other, I'd say that gothic metal is *mostly* a subgenre of symphonic metal, with some parts of the former outside the latter in cases where no symphonic sounds are used (i.e. sticking solely to vocals, bass, guitar, and drums). 
"
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","I agree with what you said. I would just add that when I describe Gothic Metal I describe it as playing with the duality of sounds between male grunts and clear female voices, with music to go along with it (often more melodic sounds to go along with the female, and heavier sounds to go with the male)."
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","Hmm. well, it doesn't always, there are straight sexed Gothic metal bands, but I think we can all admit that multi sexed bands are more popular."
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","Historically symphonic metal has come from thrash and power metal where as goth metal used to be very specifically doom metal mixed with goth rock. Since then goth metal has expanded a bit and we have bands like Delain, Elysion, etc. Because of goth's (by definition) obsession with the romantic period, they often incorporate romatic era style music, which is where their symphonic context comes from, but this is by no means a requirement.

Something can easily be in both genres simultaneously, as /u/Timmyc62 said the features are mostly orthogonal. Although I disagree with his statement that goth metal is mostly a sub-genre of symphonic metal there is often a lot of overlap between the two."
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","The degree of overlap is what I was trying to illustrate by saying gothic is *mainly* a subgenre of symphonic - imagine a large circle for symphonic, with a smaller gothic circle inside it near the edge with a bit of it sticking outside the symphonic circle. "
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","I understood what you were saying but I disagree. I imagine there are just as many gothic metal bands that would be considered symphonic as not. More like a traditional Venn diagram, with a good bit of overlap between symphonic metal and gothic metal but large portions of unique parts.

Looking at [Wikipedia's list of gothic metal bands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gothic_metal_bands). I tried to categorize them as symphonic vs. non-symphonic. I basically searched the page and if the word symphonic appeared on it I would throw it into symphonic (with 4 exceptions which I discuss). The final total was 67 non-symphonic gothic metal bands vs 44 symphonic metal gothic bands. I think while this isn't rigorous, it's pretty convincing evidence to say that gothic metal is not ""mainly a subgenre of symphonic"". 

Here is the actual categorization with notes if you're curious. https://linx.li/859ed14.txt"
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","Nice work! I admire the legwork you've done for this - clearly I was hasty with my statement. "
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","To be honest, I was actually a bit surprised at the result too. I thought it would be more evenly split."
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","I think the reason many symphonic metal bands are tagged as gothic would be because of the dark atmosphere and lyrical themes of their music. However, musically they're very different as gothic metal incorporates electronic/wave/industrial sounds. Also, this happens because bands like Theater of tragedy were some of the first bands to have the ""beauty and the beast"" vocals which are now common in symphonic metal. Try listening to [Theater of Tragedy](http://youtu.be/7hzmd3Dp3cg), [Lacrimosa](http://youtu.be/8g0B6Qpnsjg), [old Tristania](http://youtu.be/9KYtZ6SRSGQ), or [Théâtre des Vampires](http://youtu.be/RQjyIw-vG8U) to hear the differences. 

Edit: Added links"
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","mmmmmm those aformentioned bands are 4 of my favorites."
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","The definition of ""gothic metal"" has become a bit loose over the years. Originally, gothic metal evolved out of death/doom metal and gothic rock, with lots of slow ponderous riffs and atmospheric elements. Sometimes those atmospherics were achieved with orchestral instruments, but just as often it'd be with synths or whatever. As the definition of gothic metal expanded over the years, some people have applied it to music that is quite far from this original gothic music. 

Sometimes this problem is increased by the fact that some symphonic bands started as gothic. Within Temptation *were* gothic metal at one point in their careers. Go look up the song ""restless"" to hear an example of what gothic WT sounded like. Not really the same as modern WT, is it? After Forever is another example of a band that started gothic but ended up symphonic. I think this leads to mislabeling, as people say ""well, WT is labelled as gothic, and this sounds kind of like that song of their new album, so it must be gothic as well"".

Not to mention there is just plain old confusion since both genres tend to predominantly use female lead vocals, unlike other metal subgenres."
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","gothic metal first branched off from doom metal which is clearly nothing near symphonic metal. its just that some gothic metak bands started having female vocals and slow depressing orchestrations. and since some people think that any band with a female singer is symphonic metal... "
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","[deleted]"
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","I've heard many times people use the term goth metal for any band with a female front singer... I remember Evanescence being described as goth rock... So they wear black... Who cares... Wouldn't a correct statement of 'goth' metal refer to gothic period musical influence?  "
"Can someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?","No, there are many gothic bands that don't go into the gothic period. Evanescence is (no matter what they say) a gothic rock band that has attained success in the pop arena. Their lyrics are dark, brooding perhaps, self introspective definitely. But the look of a band certainly is a part of the genre definition as well. You can't deny that it would be weird as hell to see Liv Kristine and Alexander Krull strutting around dressed like I don't know any pop bands but you can insert names here.

Dressing in a gothic style, and singing lyrics with gothic influence, adding in gothic elements to your videos, and you get a goth influence on your genre and rightfully so.

"Good Xandria Songs","My personal favourite album is their first, *Kill the Sun*. Favourite song from it: *Calyx Virago*. I like that they were not typical Symphonic band and they were unique. 

From the albums with Lissa, I like *Firestorm*, *Eversleeping*, *India*, *Return to India*, *Winterhearted*... The list goes on, but they are pretty much all good. After Lissa left and Manuella stepped in on *Neverworld's End* they became more mainstream SM band, but good mainstream. Songs like *When the Mirror Cracks* and *Soulcrusher* are wonderful, refreshing and really good. 

They are a good band, but with a curse of a front woman, which is something almost all bands of this genre have. Now Manu has left and Dianne took her place, but after hearing some of the new songs, I have to say I am not impressed. She doesn't have the vocal range like Manu or that sensibility of Lissa, but now I am just ranting...

"Needing ideas to add to my Symphonic Metal playlist.","This is rather an open-ended question! I was staring at it for a while trying to figure out what to give as an answer.

Edit: This isn't every symphonic metal band :) just a bunch of ones I enjoy. The full list would be considerably longer."
"Needing ideas to add to my Symphonic Metal playlist.","Don't forget about Apocalyptica, Theatre of Tragedy, and Tristania!"
"Needing ideas to add to my Symphonic Metal playlist.","They're tricky ones - whilst I enjoy all of them, Apocalyptica mainly only use cellos so I never know whether they truly count as symphonic or not. I see Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania as more gothic metal, but I'm sure a case could be made for including them in symphonic due to the use of operatic vocals etc. :)

Though my list was by no means exhaustive, there are lots of other bands I didn't include."
"Needing ideas to add to my Symphonic Metal playlist.","Omg, thank you so much... I honestly thought symphonic metal/rock started with Avantasia and ended with Stratovaris (sp?)"
"Needing ideas to add to my Symphonic Metal playlist.","Stratovarius is a bit special, they are definitely symphonic metal but they also tend to do a lot of power metal (pretty much like Sonata Arctica). Avantasia is great too, but sadly they don't release as much albums as other bands and their last one was not so consistent.

I would also add Therion too, with a special mention to Ginnungagap (the song, not the band)."

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***Johanna Kurkela***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johanna%20Kurkela) : 

---

&gt;**Johanna Kurkela** (born 10 April, 1985 in Lumijoki, Finland) is a Finnish singer. Her first published work was a duet Tahdon tanssia kanssasi with Tomi Metsäketo in 2004. Kurkela released her first album Hetki hiljaa in 2005. She got a lot of publicity in Finnish Preselection final for Eurovision Song Contest 2007, presenting the song Olet uneni kaunein. Kurkela ended up sixth in the preselection final. A few weeks later she published her second album Marmoritaivas. She also contributed vocals to two tracks on Sonata Arctica's album The Days of Grays. Her 2010 album Hyvästi, Dolores Haze has sold over 20,000 copies.

"Tuomas Holopainen (Nightwish) - A Lifetime of Adventure [New Single from Upcoming Solo Album]","Unfortunately, no. This song was made available in the Nightwish FanPod app before it's official release as a single on Feb 7th. The album will be release until April 11."
"Tuomas Holopainen (Nightwish) - A Lifetime of Adventure [New Single from Upcoming Solo Album]","The Annette decision makes so much more sense after hearing this. ( i mean the one to hire her)"
"Tuomas Holopainen (Nightwish) - A Lifetime of Adventure [New Single from Upcoming Solo Album]","Can you elaborate on that?"
"Tuomas Holopainen (Nightwish) - A Lifetime of Adventure [New Single from Upcoming Solo Album]","ok basically this track is very much in teh style of the songs that worked well for anette's voice. I'm of the opnion that toumas has always had a voice in his head that he wanted. Anette sounds like that on the albums her problem was she couldn't tour. I'm also of the opinion that toumas has realized that nightwish must sound like nightwish, so in order to not alienate fans his more creative music must now have its own projects."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","I've known about them for a while know but only liked the song ""The Howling"" by them. Just started listening to The Heart of Everything thought I'd give them more of a try also hey posted alot about some sessions or songs with other people ?"
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","I'm a huge fan! I would recommend trying all of their albums at least once, since they're all so different. 

- *Enter* and *The Dance* are more like gothic doom, though the band stated they felt like they were just copying the metal bands they liked at the time so they went in a bit of a different direction. 

- *Mother Earth* was their first symphonic album, it's quite folky and epic and Sharon sings a bit differently on it, in a sort of Kate Bush style. 

- *The Silent Force* is more in the realm of symphonic rock, very melodic and catchy stuff, and...

- *The Heart of Everything* is a continuation of that, perhaps a little heavier and a bit more of the epic sound returns.

- *The Unforgiving* is rather different, but not as different as some people think (I admit I didn't like it at all to start with, but now it's one of my favourite albums ever). Some of the singles are more commercial sounding but amongst the rest there are some really epic, beautiful and surprisingly heavy songs. It's also a concept album and it's a good idea to read up on The Unforgiving comics and watch the videos to get a feel for what it's about. 

- Then there's *Hydra* which is out next year - the band have stated it will be ""their most metal yet"" so it will be very interesting to hear it. It has a lot of guest singers (and one guest rapper...)

There's also a few live DVDs - *Black Symphony* is wonderful and a must-watch if you're getting into WT. You can get a live CD of their acoustic show which is pretty but not that essential unless you're a big fan. Same with the QMusic covers album."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","Within Temptation is the band that got me into symphonic metal with their Mother Earth album. I'll always love their early work (Mother Earth, The Dance, Enter).

 I don't like the direction they're going in for the last few years though. While The Silent Force and The Heart of Everything are great,The Unforgiving disappointed. I didn't like the acoustic live album all that much either. 

Their new song with Tarja sounds good, but I fear most of the new album will move away from symphonic metal. "
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","I agree with you in many ways. I really miss the old sound of WT but I still like the direction they've taken. The latest album was definitely not symphonic metal, though. I hope that they'll reintroduce that aspect into their work.Have you listened to the demos that were included on the ""Paradise"" EP? They seem to be drawing some influences from their former work in those (I get kind of an ""Jane Doe"" feeling on some of the demos). My favourite demo is ""Silver Moonlight"". I'm starting to get excited to see how the next album will pan out."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","What genre would you label the last album with?"
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","Symphonic rock or alt. rock, I guess. The labels themselves aren't important, my main point is that their old work and new work is miles apart. I'm not saying this to disparage their later work, as I said I do like the later albums as well. But I would like to hear some of their roots emerging on future albums."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","Pop metal?"
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","Symphonic rock with a 80s feel is what they were aiming for."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","Ah, that would explain why it sounded strange and unusual to me."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","Just thought i'd give them another chance and i like what i hear so far on The Heart of Everything i'll try their previous albums then if the newer ones aren't that great."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","I especially enjoyed Enter. That album was my introduction to them and I really dug the combo of both voices. I really miss Westerholt's grunts on later albums..."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","Robert will be doing grunts again on Hydra, you can hear him on the demo track Silver Moonlight at least. :)"
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","When I heard that demo it got me excited for Hydra. I hope it doesn't disappoint. "
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","That is GREAT news! "
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","I thought only Sharon did the vocals on the albums :O"
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","Try the title track on Enter. The overlapping vocals are what defined Within Temptation for me early on."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","Selatcia is right, its even noted on the wikipedia article

"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","That is one of my favorite all time videos. It gives me chills. "
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","They're my favourite band, Silent Force and The Heart of Everything are my 2 favourite albums, but The Unforgiving really grew on me, songs like Lost and Fire and Ice are 2 of my all time favourite songs, the vocals are incredble."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","Those songs are just songs to sing along and shout to. Thhey're so awesome! A Demon's Fate, too"
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","Love em. All time favourite band. The old stuff is brilliant, but The Unforgiving was phenomenal. Every song was kickass and singalongable."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","They got me into symphonic metal with their Running Up That Hill cover, and The Heart of Everything album. I came to love all of their stuff. Every album is different, but great in its own way. They aren't the heaviest of bands, and that's not a bad thing."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","I loved seeing them live.

Sharon jumped and danced the entire set despite how hot the air was and that it was not long after she gave birth.

It also impressed me that she sounds like on the albums, unlike other symphonic metal vocalists."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","I heard them early on, but did not hear Enter. I have loved every album the later ones have taken some getting used to, but you know what? They still talk about the same things, the things that the band finds important. I respect that, even if the sound has changed."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","They are my favorite band. I really recommend seeing their ""black symphony"" concert, which contains many clips on youtube. "
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","I started listening to them recently and I absolutely love The Unforgiving. Their old stuff is good too."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","Great band."
"What is your opinion of Within Temptation ?","Also your opinion on Powerwolf's orchestral renditions of their tracks, love Attila Dorn's voice."

But luckily for anyone who didn't get tickets when they were on sale initially they abolished the real name dependency which was in place this year so it should be reasonably easy to acquire them via ones preferred online auction platform."

"Blind Guardian to Release New Single: “Twilight of the Gods” on December 5, 2014!","Been meaning to get into Blind Guardian for a very long time now...where should I start? I'm familiar with 3 songs by them (Otherland, Turn the Page, and The Bard's Song) and from first impressions, the vocalist sounds like one of the best Power Metal vocalists I've heard in a long time...very powerful voice."
"Blind Guardian to Release New Single: “Twilight of the Gods” on December 5, 2014!","I'd reckon Nightfall in Middle Earth is a great first album to listen to, in order to get a very comprehensive picture of both their musical and lyrical styles and themes. "
"Blind Guardian to Release New Single: “Twilight of the Gods” on December 5, 2014!","Blind Guardian has been one of my absolute favorite bands for 15 years.  Everything's good, but particularly anything from Imaginations from the Other Side and after is especially good.  Imaginations is where I started (I saw ""Bright Eyes"" on tv when music videos were still played).  Nightfall in Middle Earth is a concept album about The Silmarillion, if you're into Tolkien at all.  A Night at the Opera has ""And Then There Was Silence"" which is incredible (and as a teenager, I listened to that entire album for like 2 years straight).  Personally I wasn't crazy about A Twist in the Myth overall, but the album after that, At the Edge of Time, I think is very solid.  I particularly enjoy ""Sacred Worlds,"" ""Curse My Name,"" and ""Wheel of Time.""  


Edit:  after reading my comment and another person's reply, it seems you should start with their entire catalog.  "
"Blind Guardian to Release New Single: “Twilight of the Gods” on December 5, 2014!","Both *Sacred Worlds* and *Wheel of Time* are among my all time favourite songs. For those two alone I'd say that *At the Edge of Time* is Blind Guardian's best work."
"Blind Guardian to Release New Single: “Twilight of the Gods” on December 5, 2014!","Sacred Worlds. For me, that was the song that completely hooked me on them. It is epic and huge and gorgeous."
"Blind Guardian to Release New Single: “Twilight of the Gods” on December 5, 2014!","Imaginations From The Other Side is their most loved work amongst the fans, generally. I'd tell you to go for Nightfall In Middle Earth and Somewhere Far Beyond myself, maybe with some Follow The Blind for the older speed metal sound thrown in for good measure. 

After that, hen maybe try their newer stuff, the divisive but gloriously over the top A Night At The Opera, and the stunning latest release At The Edge Of Time. "
"Blind Guardian to Release New Single: “Twilight of the Gods” on December 5, 2014!","Bathory reference?"
"Blind Guardian to Release New Single: “Twilight of the Gods” on December 5, 2014!","Just a very common reference to Norse myth. 'Twilight of the gods' is a translation of 'Ragnarøkkr.'"
"Blind Guardian to Release New Single: “Twilight of the Gods” on December 5, 2014!","I always think things are a reference. A brewery near me had a porter named Nightside Eclipse, and I'm still convinced it was named after the Emperor album."
"Blind Guardian to Release New Single: “Twilight of the Gods” on December 5, 2014!","I saw them live at House of Blues in Orlando, Florida years ago.

"Nightwish - Song of Myself",""
"Nightwish - Song of Myself","Probably the best song they've ever done.  "
"Nightwish - Song of Myself","Not going to lie, when I first heard this song I was kinda disappointed. They'd hyped it up to be 'their longest biggest song ever' before the album release, then it gets undercut by the poem part.

Even now, whenever I hear the album, I skip past the last seven minutes. I don't know why, but the poem outro just doesn't work for me. Like, I really like Imaginaerum as an album because I like almost-there interpretive storytelling pieces, but as an album-defining showstopper, Ghost River fills the thematic role better. It kind of doesn't work for me on the album, either, since Ghost River is the third song. It brings the whole album down.

Which is kinda sad, because the one thing I've always thought Nightwish was best at is that their epics are truly epic--Beauty of the Beast, Ghost Love Score and Poet &amp; the Pendulum are all tremendously detailed, fantastic works that I think manage to stand up as some of the most profound music pieces of the past twenty years. Song of Myself...not so much."
"Nightwish - Song of Myself","It took me so long to like the poem. I was really disappointed by it too after all the hype, and used to skip it - I liked listening to the live versions where they stopped before the poem. But one day I decided try it again and it made me feel really emotional. There's just some really beautiful words in there. Though I'm still not keen on the opening of the poem where it's describing things he sees - I find it hard to relate to, whereas the later bits are more like universal truths.

I was reassured to hear that their upcoming super long song The Greatest Show on Earth won't have so much of a big block of spoken word, apparently the speaking parts are shorter and more integrated with the music (a bit like in Bless The Child I guess)."

"Possibly my Favorite Nightwish Song","Their magnum opus."
"Possibly my Favorite Nightwish Song","I'm going to go against the grain here: I don't find this song that appealing. Yes, it's grand and has many of the interesting elements that make us love Tuomas' works, but it lacks a melodic glue or theme that ties it all together. There isn't an enduring melody that clearly defines this song, unlike what you would find in, to use examples from different ends of the band's career, the Oceanborn and Imaginaerum tracks. "
"Possibly my Favorite Nightwish Song","I know what you mean about the melody thing. I guess it doesn't bother me so much since the song is in 4 distinct named parts, so it's almost like 4 different songs being put together to tell one story - but I prefer it when there's more of a continuous theme, like in GLS. 

Song of Myself has the same thing of being split but the first 3 parts are more linked together, with the last (the poem) being very different. And The Greatest Show on Earth is in 5 parts, so I'm wondering if it will be another like TPATP in style."

"I met a few members of Kamelot last week. Incredible experience!","Alissa was SO nice!! We talked about makeup, haha. They were all extremely kind and were more than happy to chat, take pictures and sign whatever asked. Their show was spectacular, they opened with Torn and HOLY SHIT. You can't miss them next time. And remember, never buy those VIP tickets, that is bs. Wait by the tour bus after the show: it's free and you get to actually talk to them, rather than being rushed for a picture and that's it. :)"
"I met a few members of Kamelot last week. Incredible experience!","Ahh, that makes me really happy! I've seen lots of comments on her facebook page saying she is really standoffish when she's doing meet-and-greets, so it's nice to hear someone contradict that!

I'm not too familiar with Kamelot, but I've heard their shows are fantastic. I'll definitely go next time!

Are VIP tickets really bad? The last VIP experience I had was great. We met with the band an hour and a half before they went on stage. I talked to them for at least 45 minutes and got pictures as well. Strange. Well, I'll definitely hang out by the tour bus next time for sure!"
"I met a few members of Kamelot last week. Incredible experience!","I've never bought VIP tickets because I just wait by the tour buses. By talking to people who've bought the tickets, specifically at the Kamelot show, they said Kamelot didn't talk much, just posed for pictures, etc. Given the alotted amount of time to pose with 50+ people before showtime isn't much. I talked with their drummer Casey a good 20 minutes.

I'm not saying never ever buy the tickets, but I find them highly necessary. It was like $65 or so for Kamelot's VIP tickets. I paid $24 for a regular ticket, and after waiting for a while, got exactly what everyone who paid $65 for got, and a longer chance to speak with them. "

Another one of those days whose dullness won't end

My spirit in its fight for freedom

longs after something higher.


Joined in dream and reality, my other self rises up

terrifyingly dark and wonderful, my soul trembles.


It's the yearning that carries us

across the sea, to a faraway land

We sail off, never to return

over the edge of the world


It's the yearning that carries us

across the sea, to a faraway land

Our hearts unencumbered

destination unknown


Though it be but a mirage, it gives me a respite

The longed-for wanderlust that I imagine

In demonic form


What spurs us on unconsciously, is ever stirred by the night

But blown on by the light of hope 

it soars into the otherworld


A faraway land

Further

Ever further

Far away


It's the yearning that carries us

across the sea, to a faraway land

We sail off, never to return

over the edge of the world


It's the yearning that carries us

across the sea, to a faraway land

I read some of the reviews and an overwhelming majority favored it, so I thought I'd give it a listen. Holy shit, was I amazed. It was unlike anything I'd ever heard of. *Metal and classical instruments mixed? Where has this been all of my life?* I thought to myself. I instantly fell in love with that album, and soon afterwards the band. And then the genre. That album was Design Your Universe by Epica.

It wasn't until recently I heard [Eluvietie - The Call of the Mountains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w2m-TeLi6I) (clearly not their best - by a long shot) and liked the folky/strings/classical sound of it and looked a bit deeper.

"What song first got you into symphonic metal? Post links!","I'm probably not the typical symphonic metal fan - I'm much older than the average, I suspect. I grew up listening to Black Sabbath which contains the roots to doomy gothic metal. Then heavy music went to shit in the '90s basically, and I stuck to the classic metal stuff. Years later, somehow, I discovered Evanescence when the Fallen album came out. Being in North America, this stuff was unheard of, so I searched for similar stuff. 

I was also exploring other metal (and still enjoy other genres), but the definitive song that really got me into this stuff was [Nymphetamine by Cradle of Filth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dW6aNAZGTM) - yes I realize this wouldn't qualify as ""symphonic metal"", but Liv Kristine sings it, so I searched her other stuff out and ran across early Leaves Eyes, leading me to other stuff like Tristania which blew me away. Inevitably I ran across Nightwish (still almost unheard of in Canada), Within Temptation, Epica, etc.

But Karevik's work through *Silverthorn* was nothing short of amazing; and I look forward to their next album (anticipated March 2015) with great joy. I can't wait to see them live when they get back into my area in May (with DragonForce, too!). It's going to kick so much ass..."
"What song first got you into symphonic metal? Post links!","My only concern is that Tommy is trying too hard to sound like Khan. As much as I want him to sound just like him, I know he has to find his place in Kamelot and be himself.

"What song first got you into symphonic metal? Post links!","I like how Tommy's been playing it so far, mostly like Khan but with putting his own personality into it. If you've heard him in any of his work with Seventh Wonder, it's basically exactly that same feel. I can understand that on the first album with him, you want to really introduce his vocal stylings to Khan fans though, so that might be why he sounded as he did. "
"What song first got you into symphonic metal? Post links!","I really like how he's played it so far too. I just wish to hear him once he really put his own personality into it. I'm excited for what Kamelot has in store for us. "

I can't find the video, but I'll never forget that moment as it changed my life. Too bad my siblings didn't grow attached.

When I hear the song now, it doesn't quite have the same feeling as before - but I do get a massive nostalgia boner when it plays from shuffle.

Originally we were going to wait until 2014 to make a decision about the future line-up of the band, but the past year has clearly shown us that Floor and Troy are perfect matching pieces to our puzzle, and we are really grateful of the bond that has grown between all of us. We love you guys.

Commented vocalist Floor Jansen: ""Words cannot describe what I feel! This union is beyond everything and I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to continue this amazing journey with my new brothers! Once I had a dream…and this is it!!!""


Piper/whistleman, added vocalist Troy Donockley: ""`Imaginaerum World Tour´was a revelation to me and in that time, I became aware of a growing unity and then, finally, a transcendence of all the usual nonsense that affects bands. A beautiful process. And since the idea, the musical dream that is NIGHTWISH has been a part of me since before I was born, I am delighted to officially sail into uncharted waters with my brothers and sister. Wondrous scenes Ahoy! ""


The new line-up can be seen on the live / tour documentary DVD »Showtime, Storytime«, released on November 29th.

"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","Awwwwwwwwwwwww yeah."
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","Wonder if they can be convinced to do a rerelease of all their old songs..."
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","Has anybody ever done something like this? There are probably hours of music/songs to record...

(unless this is just wishful thinking, then I hope so too :D )"
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","The only band I can think of who's done something similar is Amberian Dawn, who re-recorded a bunch of their songs with their new vocalist and released it as an album: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-Evolution_(album)"
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","Sonata Arctica also did some badass remakes of their old songs. *My land*, *Replica* and *Wolf and Raven* come to mind at least. Also *Losing my insanity* from their latest album is a revisit of an old song the Man (Tony Kakko, look him up!) wrote eons ago."
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","I was just thinking of bands re-recording old songs with new vocalists :) but yeah there are some good re-recordings in general, like Nightwish did Sleeping Sun and Astral Romance."
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","Oh nice, I had never heard of them! I keep on discovering new music on this sub, thanks! :)"
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","Arch Enemy also did this with root of all evil so gossow would have a routine with the older songs and they could play them live without amott doing the vocals."
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","I hated this album, mostly because Heidi did a good job doing those songs and they don't really fit capri's style.
I don't think nightwish should redo their old stuff mostly because Anette's style is different from Tajra's or Floor's style. They should just train on ahead and see what new things they can make with Floor."
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","I don't think they would do, because they didn't re-record any Tarja stuff with Anette, not even on a live record as far as I know (excepting the live rehearsal videos that they did of Planet Hell and Romanticide)."
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","&gt; Has anybody ever done something like this? There are probably hours of music/songs to record...

Yes, but in a *very* different genre. :) At the end of the 70s, [Jean Ferrat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Ferrat) re-recorded almost all of his songs after [PolyGram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolyGram) bought the rights to the previous recordings from his label. He did not want to depend on a major, so he created a new label, and released 11 re-recorded discs!"
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","That's dedication!"
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","I would be happy with some sort of multi disc best of Nightwish remastered type of thing. Maybe 3 or 4 discs of the best music . Just start with most of the end of an era and add some newer stuff and some early stuff"
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","So where does this leave ReVamp?"
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","No reason she cant do both."
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","Didn't they announced a new incoming album ? Floor posted something about it on her facebook page not so long ago if my memory isn't failing me.
About the remastering album tho, am I the only one who thinks that the Tarja-Nightwish albums are untouchable ? I mean, Floor is the best they can find and will do great without any doubt but ... Holy shit guys, except from certain songs (Ghost Love Score ...) which really do well considering Floor has a much more potent voice, I don't think I'll be able to ear a remastered version of Once or Angels Fall First, or even Wishmaster with any other voice than Tarja's. Well, Oceaborn is more about keyboard master pieces and Wilska so why not and Century Child is Marco's ..."
"Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley are now full time members of Nightwish.","ReVamp's new album was out a while back :) It's called Wild Card. Like I said above, I don't think they would re-record old stuff with Floor because they never did that with Anette."

"Diabulus In Musica interview: Zuberoa Aznarez and Gorka Elso discuss writing symphonic metal, their latest album and what it tastes like. Really.","I was lucky enough to interview Zuberoa Aznarez and Gorka Elso of Spanish symphonic metallers Diabulus in Musica, who are about to tour with Xandria. And very nice they were too. 

The full interview: http://npollard.wordpress.com/2014/10/24/interview-diabulus-in-musica/


YOUR MUSIC IS MASSIVE SOUNDING. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT TAKES LONG 'SIT DOWN AND WRITE' SESSIONS? I COULDN'T IMAGINE SO MUCH COMING TO ME NATURALLY.

Zuberoa Aznarez: For us it is a very natural thing because we come from the classical scene and also the metal scene, so I think we are very used to working with each element. When I think about melody or something like that, I can hear inside me the powerful orchestra. Everything! So it all comes from our musical background.

Gorka Elso: It’s still not easy because when you’re writing, you finish the song with one hundred tracks or something like that! But it’s still very natural to us.


HOW CAN YOU RESIST MAKING YOUR SONGS MUCH LONGER? IT'S HUGE ENOUGH SOUNDING THAT IT WOULD WARRANT A TWENTY-MINUTE MONSTER SONG.

Gorka: When we write a song, when we start with a melody or a little element, usually you want to express something. You don’t need too much time to express something. I love long songs. Ten minutes. Twelve minutes. But sometimes it’s better to do something… well, not shorter, but only the time that each song needs. Nothing more.

Zuberoa: Yeah. I think sometimes it seems like a good song has to be long. It’s not always that way though. I think the song is asking for something. To be short, to be long… or whatever. Doing a long song only because it’s supposed to be a better song… we don’t think it’s worth it. We only make what we think the music needs.


ON THE SUBJECT OF THAT KIND OF MUSIC, HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO SAY TO ANYONE WHO THINKS THAT METAL IS A STEP DOWN FROM CLASSICAL MUSIC?

Zuberoa: I think that both kinds are complimentary. Metal music is a very rich style too, because I think you can do whatever you want with metal. It’s very open to other kinds of music, not just classical music, but also kinds like folk. You can fit many different styles inside metal. A lot of metal musicians are from the classical field so I think in generally, music is music! With music, you can do so many things, and you can express so many different things. It’s stupid to do only one thing, so to lineate all of the different qualities of your personality is bad.

Gorka: I think that metal with symphonic music is the perfect marriage, to express many different kinds of things. Each of our songs are not just symphonic or just metal. We want to do all kinds of music that fits with what we want to express.

Zuberoa: There are many different elements. There’s classical music. Also folk. Also some electronic stuff. We never say no to something new, because every musical element can express something special.


YOUR NEW ALBUM IS CALLED ARGIA. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

Zuberoa: It is a Basque word. It means ‘light’ in Basque language. Some people think it’s related to a Greek mythological thing called Argia, but it’s another thing. We chose the name because we speak Basque here, and ‘light’ refers to the new. The former bandmates had left the band, so we had to start from scratch.


WITH SUCH A DISTINCT ALBUM TITLE, ARTWORK AND MUSIC, IS THERE A THEME, OR CONCEPT OR STORY BEHIND IT ALL?

Zuberoa: Not really, but all the songs are related with personal things from the last two years like when the guys left the band. So it has been a very personal process because we didn’t know what to do with the band – whether to continue with it. We were a bit lost. Finally we decided to continue because Gorka and me are the founders of the band, and also the main composers. It made no sense to leave it. All the songs refer to the new light we had found not only in the band, but also as individuals. We are a couple too so these last two years have been also special for us, so I think it’s a mixture of a new musical path, and new personal life.

You have used quite a few languages in your music. Why do you refuse to settle on just one? Have you ever been worried about how songs might be received?


YOU HAVE USED QUITE A FEW LANGUAGES IN YOUR MUSIC. WHO DO YOU REFUSE TO SETTLE ON JUST ONE? HAVE YOU EVER BEEN WORRIED ABOUT HOW SONGS MIGHT BE RECEIVED?

Zuberoa: Well, not really. On one hand, yes, because we are from the north of Spain, in the Basque Country, so when we started to write our songs, we started in English. Our first album was in English and some Latin words in the parts of the choir. We started only with English and Latin. So, when we decided to write a second album (The Wanderer), I decided to use Basque because I thought it really fit with the story, because the story of ‘The Wanderer’ is talking about someone very special and different and strange. It’s a very ancient language. And then we eventually wrote in Spanish!

Here, there are political problems because of the Spanish people and the Basque people and all that stuff, but we don’t like politics at all. We only defend culture. We are Spanish. We are Basque. We are both. We don’t want to enter any political issues, but if we only sang in Basque then some people would only see the political side or something like that. So, I decided to include Spanish. Well… not only because of that! (laughs) So that’s four languages.

Gorka: And I think Italian is on the last album too!

Zuberoa: I don’t know if in the future if I’ll maybe play with French!

"Diabulus In Musica interview: Zuberoa Aznarez and Gorka Elso discuss writing symphonic metal, their latest album and what it tastes like. Really.","I discovered them recently and was pleasantly surprised. Some really awesome stuff on their new album. I actually thought their singer sounded uncannily like Manuela (ex-Xandria). I love Eternal Breeze and Mechanical Ethos."
"Diabulus In Musica interview: Zuberoa Aznarez and Gorka Elso discuss writing symphonic metal, their latest album and what it tastes like. Really.","Yeah, Argia was pretty awesome. Especially ""From the Embers,"" ""Healing,"" ""Chronos' Maze"" and the one directly after from the embers on the album. 

I like all their albums to a degree. Not quite Epica, but close, and refreshing as well. "
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","So, in symphonic metal, several bands are known for doing heavily themed/concept albums focused around certain ideas or stories.

It'd be nice to see what people come up with, and maybe we can all find some nice new albums to listen to.

My favorites would be:

1. Tristania - World of Glass (mostly gothic metal, with some symphonic influences): this one is in my opinion the best gothic metal album ever made, and Tristania's magnum opus. It deals with topics such as religious bigotry, war, depression, suicide and the end of the world. It's a very dark, depressing and tragic album, but very beautiful and with many memorable lyric snippets.

2. After Forever - Invisible Circles (symphonic progressive metal): I love this album so much. It's my favorite After Forever album, and I love how it tells this continuous story throughout the entire album, with a few characters whose roles are played by the vocalists, choirs and sometimes voice actors. It deals with child abuse, loveless marriages, career obsession, bullying, escapism from reality through internet and video games, and dysfunctional family dynamics. It's a very interesting criticism of abusive families in modern society. Some would call it a metal opera because of how the album and the songs are structured.

3. Epica - Consign to Oblivion/Design Your Universe/Requiem for the Indifferent/The Quantum Enigma: (it's 4 albums here, but they're very closely related thematically and lyrically): Aside from 3 of these albums being among my favorites (with TQE being my favorite album of all time), I really like the concepts and ideas explored on these albums. The ""A New Age Dawns"" concept, with the idea of humanity being in charge of its own fate and having the ability to repair the harm it has caused to itself and nature, as well as the idea that in modern society, people are too detached from their own humanity and spirituality and that we're driven by greed, materialism, power and a huge scientific/technological ambition to a self-destructive degree. There's also the concept of quantum mysticism, which (while pseudoscientific and likely fictional) is a very interesting way to think about the fusion of scientific knowledge with spirituality, religion and the potential existence of a deity and our connection to the universe itself.

4. Nightwish - Imaginaerum: this one isn't really a concept album, but it is a themed album and it seems to have an overall strong artistic vision (especially since it's connected to the movie). It's my favorite Nightwish album, and it has some really strong melodies, a good atmosphere, as well as lyrics and vocal performances. It's also a very uplifting and dynamic album, even though it gets a bit pretentious and melodramatic in parts (such as the poem in the second half of Song of Myself), but that's sort of to be expected from Nightwish anyway.

5. Within Temptation - The Unforgiving: this one is a pretty great album and I love how unique it is. It seems a bit on the linear storytelling side of things (kinda like Invisible Circles but not as structured), and I love how it's tied to a comic book story. It was really nice to follow the hype and promotion around the release period, when they were releasing the comic-book inspired short movies and music videos. It has one of the most unique aesthetics and artistic visions I've seen in symphonic metal."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","Kamelot - Epica/The Black Halo.  These are two of the albums that got me into symphonic metal, with The Black Halo still being one of my favourites in the genre.  They are based on Goethe's Faust, which is quite an ambitious concept for a rock/metal album.  The music is awesome, with the song ""Memento Mori"" being particularly memorable."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","Oh yeah, I forgot about that one. And I agree, it's a great album and Memento Mori is pretty amazing."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","After Forever's *Invisible Circles* gets a lot of hate, but it's among my favourites too. Only their final album is better.

With Tristania I could never choose between *World of Glass* and *Widow's Weeds*. 

To add albums that haven't been mentioned in this thread but absolutely deserve to be (in no particular order):

* Therion - *Secret of the Runes* is a brilliant work of art. It deals extensively with Nordic mythology, in particular its various worlds. Look up the live version of *Schwarzalbenheim*.

* Leaves' Eyes - *Symphonies of the Night* is my favourite album by them. Each track tells the story of a heroine from history, legend or literature. The titular song is one of my all time favourite symphonic metal songs! 

* Delain - *The Human Contradiction* is inspired by a science fiction series and has a noticeable theme, but I'm not sure if it should be called a concept album. Still, it's their best work imo. 

* Blind Guardian - *At the Edge of Time* has most tracks based on fantasy/sci-fi series. *Sacred Worlds* and *Wheel of Time* are unbelievably good songs.

I could go on but the albums I mentioned already are so ridiculously good, if any of them are unfamiliar you should fix that asap!"
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","1. [Avantasia - The Metal Opera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHjYmyJlSSI): Can't believe this came out thirteen years ago now, time flies. It's symphonic metal with strong power metal influences and lots of synths. What sets this album apart is the all-star cast: Tobias Sammet (Edguy), Sharon Den Adel (Within Temptation), Michael Kiske &amp; Kai Hansen (Helloween), Oliver Hartmann (At Vance), Timo Tolkki (Stratovarius), Andre Matos (Angra), and others. Not only they're great singers, I love how they're attributed characters and how songs are constructed as dialogs between them.  
The lyrics are also pretty cool, they're a fantasy story based off gnosis and Christian imagery. It reminds me of Diablo and Soul Reaver a bit =)

2. [Haggard - Awaking the Century](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZT99lqg5L8): This is symphonic metal with a chamber orchestra and harsh vocals. The music is very baroque, sometimes medieval and it would be fair to draw comparisons to folk metal. This album is a perfect example of the ""Beauty and the Beast"" trope but with more diversity than the genres usually offers - thanks to the huge ensemble of musicians and inspired songwriting. Songs do not follow usual templates the album is flowing freely - it's hard to guess when the metal parts are coming but they always fit perfectly.  
I've never paid attention to the story very much but I recall it's about [Nostradamus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostradamus).

3. [Rhapsody - Legendary Tales/Symphony of Enchanted Land/Dawn of Victory/Rain of a Thousand Flames/Power of the Dragonflame](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtAjGVhQNJk): I'm a bit biased here because Rhapsody is the band that got me into symphonic metal in the first place. Nonetheless, releasing a complete (cheesy) fantasy saga across five albums is still an incredible feat! The music is a blend of power metal with lots of synths and clear baroque inspirations, topped by male vocals and neoclassical guitar solos.

4. [Therion - Secret of the Runes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3p6jtN3EpU): Incredible album from start to finish. Like most Therion releases, it's hard to pick ""hit"" or favorite tracks. It's very well crafted music that paints its own world without trying to hook the listener in so it takes a bit of effort to get into. The choir and numerous vocalists give a very operatic tone to the album (not to mention the Nordic theme which resonates with Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen). If you've never listened to Therion before, I wouldn't recommend this album first."

"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","Definitely a huge fan of The Unforgiving, but I have to disagree on Invisible Circles. The music is great, but the god awful, cringeworthy voice acting almost ruined the album for me.

It hasn't been released yet, but I'm really excited for Dark Sarah's first album. Almost like a concept band. Also, not really a concept album per se, but I love the theme of powerful/important women, whether in fiction or history, running through Leaves' Eyes' Symphonies of the Night."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","Oh yeah, still need to check Leaves' Eyes latest stuff. I never followed them much since I'm not a fan of Liv Kristine's voice, but some of the tracks I heard seemed pretty good."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","I wasn't a fan until SotN, and that's still the only album I really enjoy."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","The Embrace that Smothers. It's a series of songs by After Forever and Epica covering the problems of organised religion, something I identify with. Album wise I think The Divine Conspiracy handled it the best and it's enjoyable musically. Shout out to Mea Culpa, in my opinion the best intro track to an album ever."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","THE ALL POWERFUL THE ALMIGHTY, THE INTERGALACTIC SENSATION

**ZILTOID THE OMNISCIENT!**"
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","[deleted]"
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","Carach Angren - Where the Corpses Sink Forever

Where the Corpses Sink Forever is a symphonic black metal concept album about the atrocities of war that beautifully blends brutality of the metal side with the flow and melody of the symphonic side. 

I had heard a little bit of symphonic metal before that and was never really too keen on it, but Where the Corpses Sink Forever was the first symphonic metal that really caught my attention and led me to delve deeper into other symphonic metal and really give it a chance; and I'm very glad that it did.
"
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","I've heard some Carach Angren stuff before and I liked it. I should look into that album."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","I definitely liked it more than their previous albums. It just seems like it struck an ideal balance between beauty and brutality, to me. In addition, it sounds like the production value is much higher and is overall more refined than their earlier albums.

I've heard it described as their previous recordings utilizing symphonic elements as a more traditional metal role while Where the Corpses Sink Forever lets the symphonic elements stay a bit more symphonic and stand somewhat on their own while more of working alongside and intertwining with the metal rather than being just ""metal parts played on symphonic type instruments."" 

That may not make much sense until you've listened to the album, but I think it is about as accurate of a description as can be made by someone not particularly well educated on nuances, technicalities, and proper terminology; ie, me."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","For full on albums, I find bands tend to lose focus by the end of the album for the most part (Imaginaerum comes to mind) with few bands keeping it together throughout (Kamelot's Epica/Black Halo)

With that, I prefer pieces put together, much like the Elizabeth trilogy on Karma (Kamelot) or The Embrace That Smothers (After Forever/Epica)."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","My favourites:

1. Imaginaerum by Nightwish 
2. The Unforgiving by WT
3. The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck by Tuomas Holopainen 
4. Njord by Leaves' Eyes (for the Viking/Norse theme)

I would probably include pretty much every Epica album, since they seem to always have a particular theme."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","Life and Times is fantastic, but I didn't think it really fell under metal.  I love it when the horns kick in on 'Into the West'."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","Oh true, it's definitely not metal! I heard it wasn't even going to have any guitars or drums until he begrudgingly added some to the single. I guess I just think of it within the genre since it's Tuomas and the compositions are so Nightwishy."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","Lots of great entries on here but I think the winner has got to be either Beethoven's Last Night - TSO or Ayreon's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/01011001"
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","[deleted]"
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","Therion - Secret of the rune (Norse Mythology)

Fleshgod Apocalypse - Labyrinth (labyrinth of Knossos)"
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","The Quantum Enigma is nice, but it isn't quite a concept album for me... or at least I didn't grasp the story, although I can see why others view it that way.

The Unforgiving however, is the best one I've heard. Love it. Storytelling and metal with a 80s vibe."
"What are your favorite themed/concept albums?","Yeah, it's a themed album, not a concept album."
"SECRETS OF SIN - Inside",""
"SECRETS OF SIN - Inside","My favorite song from this band is Once upon a time, but they don't have it on youtube. If you have an spotify account, be sure to check this song also."

"Tarja Turunen reaches out to Anette Olzon","Maybe there will be a band in about 10 years with all the fired leads of Nightwish, their hit single maybe ""We don't need Tuomas"" (I'm a fan of Nighwish, all of their/his music btw)."
"Tarja Turunen reaches out to Anette Olzon","Evanescence did this with all the members of the original band except for the singer, getting a singer that sounds really similar and calling themselves ""we are the fallen"". 

Evanescence's first album was named Fallen. "
"Tarja Turunen reaches out to Anette Olzon","We Are The Fallen's singer sounds like a cross between Amy Lee and Cristina Scabbia.  I was unaware of that backstory of the band members though."
"Tarja Turunen reaches out to Anette Olzon","their album is very similar to (read: exactly the same as) the fallen album. it's pretty good, would recommend to people who enjoyed fallen."

"Tarja Turunen reaches out to Anette Olzon","It makes sense. Both of these women have no reason to have any ill will towards each other. Hell even some of the lyrics of tarja's solo stuff leads me to believe she is still affected by the circumstances that lead to her dismissal. 

Though I think Anettes main issue was her body at (41) couldn't handle the stress of having a child and touring a schedule like nightwish kept. Even floor had a mental break after the schedule kept by after forever. Its what revamps wild card album is about.

Nightwish often takes a good year or so off after tours to stop that from happening, it just so happened annette had a kid during this time.

She was a good vocalist for what toumas wanted which is why he picked her. He wanted to make more film score music. DPP was a therapy album, Imaginarium was what he hired Anette for and she killed it on that album. Anette always had issues with pitch live however something Tarja never did. I can understand why they decided to make a change. Unlike the situation with tarja (where they made it abundantly clear her firing had less to do with her and more to do with her husband) anettes was left at a ""we have decided to part ways we wish her the best of luck"". Most bands don't last 5 years, Anette was with nightwish for almost as long as tarja. (1999-2005 and 2007-2012)"
"Tarja Turunen reaches out to Anette Olzon","I know this is an old comment, but Tarja has been in NW from 1996 not 1999"
"Tarja Turunen reaches out to Anette Olzon","They didn't release AFF till end of 98."
"Tarja Turunen reaches out to Anette Olzon","Yes but until 1998 they worked on AFF. 

The band was formed in 1996 by Tuomas, Tarja ans Emppu(Jukka aswell i think but i'm not sure). So I guess you can add the time they spent on making that album. I don't want to be 'that guy', but it's just my opinion"
"Tarja Turunen reaches out to Anette Olzon","I guess thats true but i guess i was more viewing touring life span. They didn't really play shows until after AFF was written.

The thing is now that they have Floor most of the performance problems go away from annette and i can say she is personally more fun to watch than tarja who took a more diva (as in opera diva lots of costume changes etc) to performing. Floor just gets up head bangs has fun and sings on pitch and awesome.

Plus she gives toumas so many more tools. The things she does in revamp is awesome.
"
"Tarja Turunen reaches out to Anette Olzon","You are right, Floor really is great live. Her voice is wonderful, and I personally cant say I want Tarja back in NW. I like Tarja's solo work aswell. 

Also, about the diva thing, you are so right. I went on her concert in Vienna on Sunday, and she changed her outfit 2 times. 
I really think Floor is great and I'm looking forward to their new album, but I could never like Nightwish like I used to... For me Tuomas makes me not like the band so much:/

Anyway, I understand what you are saying and I agree with you, but I still like Tarja more than Nightwish(mostly because of Tuomas)."
"Tarja Turunen reaches out to Anette Olzon","Toumas writes all of the music save a few tracks marco writes. Tarja writes next to none of her music save the lyrics and oasis. 

IF you like nightwish it is solely because of toumas."
"Tarja Turunen reaches out to Anette Olzon","You are right, Tuomas did write about 90% of the songs, but what I dont like about him is how he kicked Tarja out of NW. I personally think it was jealousy towards Tarja's husband. I do belive Tuomas is a great writer, but he was an asshole when he did that. "
"Tarja Turunen reaches out to Anette Olzon","You do realise that the reason they kicked tarja was because her husband started making unrealistic demands as her manager such as no shows &lt;3000 people, she had to fly on a separate plane with him etc. They didn't want to get rid of Tarja, but from a business standpoint nightwish isn't metallica they aren't selling out arena's in the US and they aren't going to make enough to book tarja a private jet to fly around in on tour.

"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","After over a year of being stuck on Silverthorn and seeing Kamelot preform twice, I have come to the conclusion that I prefer Tommy over Khan. I recently popped in Ghost Opera, don't get me wrong, that album is unbelievable, but I almost wish it had Tommy's voice on it. Tommy has such a range and I feel like he does Khan's stuff live better, just an overall better live performer. Aaaaand it also doesn't hurt that Tommy's kind of a heartthrob. ;)

Who do you guys prefer and why? "
"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","As a fan who's been listening to Kamelot since *The Black Halo*, I'm going to have to go with Khan. His voice was very unique within the Power Metal scene and Metal in general. *Epica* remains one of my favorite Kamelot albums and Roy's performance in that album is amazing. Tommy is great, he is a tenor and obviously has a wider range than Khan did, but I like him more for Seventh Wonder. I feel, at least with *Silverthorn*, that he was somewhat holding back and trying to sound like Khan. But then again, it all comes down to personal taste. "
"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","As a very casual fan, I like them both equally. They have similar voices, I think."
"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","I think right now I prefer Khan primarily because of his lyrics. I don't think Tommy is particularly bad at writing, but lyrically Silverthorn was no Epica. But, I am on board with Tommy singing and I believe that anything is possible in Kamelot's future!"
"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","I will shamefully admit that I was never too into Kamelot until Tommy joined the band. Silverthorn is one of my favorite albums now, heh."
"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","I was kind of the same way. Silverthorn didn't get me into Kamelot, but it did get me back into Kamelot. I listened to The Black Halo for a while and then just forgot about them. :'( But thanks to Tommy, I've seen them twice now. He's extremely nice, met him after a show once!"
"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","I've never been able to see either of them live (They don't visit Canada much and when they do, not in Alberta &gt;.&lt;). But I've always loved Khans vocals and what got me into metal as a genre (Sonata Arctica and Within Temptation also helped).

Though Tommy is great also, eagerly waiting to hear their next album with more of a Tommy twist than Silverthorn."
"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","I can't wait to hear what he will do next! I feel like on Silverthorn he wasn't able to use his range quite as much because they were kind of still writing with Khan in mind, but Tommy's range is incredible and I love everything he's ever been a part of. Just a great talent he is."
"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","I feel like with some of Kamelot's older songs (I'm thinking the *Epica/Black Halo* era and before), Khan's voice brings something really unique to the albums.  But I never managed to see them live with Khan (but the videos of Khan live are seriously impressive), and so I've only seen Tommy... and Tommy was absolutely amazing on stage.  He's got an amazing presence and a great voice, and he's just a really awesome and sweet person (I splurged and got VIP tickets...).  

I will say though, Tommy was a brilliant choice on Kamelot's part.  Khan's voice has some unique quality to it that I can't quite name, but Tommy's range covers it well enough that he does a good job performing older Kamelot songs.  *Silverthorn* is pretty good, but it seems written for Khan, but now that Kamelot's got a much better idea of Tommy's voice, I have faith the next album will be awesome :)"
"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","I'm fans of both. Heard about Tommy since the beginning of Seventh Wonder and Khan since Epica. Tommy is prob my second favorite singer and Khan being #1 (albeit imo miles ahead of Tommy still). I'm classically trained and can tell when someone is singing the notes vs singing the song. Tommy satisfies the old songs but he is missing ""something"". Also if you've heard the Fourth Legacy or anything he has done in Conception you know Roy had a higher range than Tommy."
"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","As a whole, I prefer Tommy, though I slightly prefer his vocals in Seventh Wonder.

Regarding Kamelot, Khan offered something unique, and very enjoyable. It's sad that that's gone. However, given that he *did* leave, Tommy's a fantastic choice. Silverthorn is easily one of Kamelot's best albums, and I can't wait to see where they go from here. So, all in all, I wouldn't have wished to see Tommy replace Khan, but I also wouldn't want to see Khan replace Tommy."
"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","I LOOOOVE Seventh Wonder. Holy crap, they're so good."
"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","I'm gonna give it to Tommy I think. I saw them live with him, and he did such a mindblowing job that I hardly know what could top it. I personally like Tommy's voice a little better than Khan's as well. I can't really say one is better than the other, but for myself I go with Tommy all the way. Especially him doing The Human Stain and March of Mephisto live. And Ghost Opera. And When The Lights Are Down. And The Haunting. And I'll stop now hahaha"
"Kamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?","Did you dee Tommy prefer Don't Your Cry live? Possibly one of the most beautiful performances I've ever heard. "

"Official live video of Ghost Love Score with Floor (from Showtime, Storytime)","She sings differently, in Buenos Aires for example she sings ""My fall willl be for youuuuu"" whereas in Wacken its ""My falll will beeeee fooooooor you"" and I really prefer the first version of it.

But the solo from Emppu in this video is just ... miles away from any other version of it \o/."
"Official live video of Ghost Love Score with Floor (from Showtime, Storytime)","I think they both have their merits. The crowd are way more excited, loud and passionate in the Buenos Aires version - which is really just a cultural thing, I guess us Europeans are generally more reserved at concerts, even if we're having an amazing time (or they're like me who just cried for the whole of GLS... I've become one of *those* girls...). I also prefer the ending of the Buenos Aires one. I'm not sure if she deliberately sang it differently at Wacken or just got the timing a bit wrong.

"No decision on Nightwish singer yet but Floor is ""top of the list""","Whoa what happened to Annette?"
"No decision on Nightwish singer yet but Floor is ""top of the list""","She left the band in October last year after getting pregnant with her 3rd child. There were obviously tensions within the band and she was struggling to cope with touring. She also got very ill and had to go to hospital and miss a show, and was angry that the band continued without her. Shortly after they had a mutual split, and Floor Jansen (from After Forever and ReVamp) has been filling in ever since. They've recorded some live videos with her and also filmed a DVD at Wacken which will be out around Christmas.

Anette has been off having her baby and getting married, and she's working on a solo album.

"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","I've been a fan ever since Once was released, so I had the chance of discovering Nightwish with Tarja. With her leaving the band, I felt like I had to get used to the new sound Anette delivered. Back in the day there was this whole ""Team Tarja vs Team Anette""-thing, something I hope we fans don't have to see ever again. I wouldn't say Anette was better/worse than Tarja, it was just... different.

Now, with Floor Jansen being the new Nightwish vocalist, how do you feel about her?

In my opinion, Floor's got what it takes to take Nightwish into a new era of great music. As I listened to ""Ghost River"" on their live album, I noticed that, aside from the melodic singing we know from Tarja too well, she was able to produce some raw tones in the song, something I haven't heard from Anette (no offense). I think Floor is a great vocalist, and I'd like to hear what Reddit has to say about it."
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","Floor is my favorite vocalist and Nightwish my favorite band, it's the best thing that could have happened. Also she rocks live."
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","I have seen Floor live two times this year (once at the concert recorded on ""Showtime, Storytime"" and at Retrospect) and I wholeheartedly agree. While I didn't have any problems with Anette - maybe because I discovered Nightwish only after Tarja left and never had the pleasure of seeing her perform with Nightwish in person - I now like Nightwish even more than before as Floor is able to perform both the songs ""written for"" Anette and those from Tarja's time fabulously."
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","It's kind of weird for me hearing Floor in a softer scene of Symphonic metal because i'm so used to her in After Forever and I'm a bigger fan of the heavier symphonic metal.

However, I think Floor was brilliant with Nightwish. The only song i've listened to her with Nightwish so far is Ever Dream, which is absolutely brilliant and it's live as well.

Id be nice to see more heavier songs from nightwish, but i'll take what i can get."

"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","That is by far my favorite song and she does it just as well as Tarja."
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","I can't wait to see the DVD. Until I do I can't judge as I haven't heard them with Floor. But I've always been a fan of Nightwish, Revamp and After Forever."
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","[Here is a song from the live dvd from the official channel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvkYwOJZONU)"
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","Thanks for this! I'm totally in love with her now!"
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","I became a fan of Nightwish when Dark Passion Play came out and a friend leant me a CD. So I started as a fan of Annette, and then as I bought their back catalogue I became a fan of Tarja as well. I never understood the hatred of one or the other because I enjoyed both of their voices for totally different reasons. I thought Tuomas's analogy that Tarja sang like a beautiful, cold mountain stream and Annette like a warm storyteller was spot on. As for the live performances (having only seen Tarja on DVD and solo) I found Tarja's technique a bit all over the place but in general she has great stage presence and can be very energetic. Annette gave great live performances too, though she was noticeably much better at the songs that were written for her voice, I still mostly enjoyed her versions of older songs.

As for Floor, I was always impressed with her voice in After Forever. I then saw her live with ReVamp and was amazed - I'd never seen someone sing so well live before. She effortlessly went from operatic vocals to rock vocals and even into some growls which she was only just learning to do at the time. So when I heard she was going to sing with Nightwish, I knew straight away that she'd do a good job. The only thing that worried me was that I'd never felt particularly moved or emotional when listening to her songs before, though I really enjoyed them (I'm still not sure why), so I was worried that I wouldn't connect with her voice in Nightwish. Well, I went to see them in London, and was proved completely 100% wrong because I cried like a baby all the way through Ghost Love Score and was instantly hooked. 

I haven't got the DVD yet (fingers crossed it will arrive tomorrow) but I've seen the couple of videos released from it and was as impressed as always. I can see why some people might think Floor is over-hyped - it can be difficult to avoid people talking about how great she is online - and I admit I felt rather uncomfortable with people's unquestioning adoration of her when many were so vitriolic towards Annette. But Floor has more than earned my admiration and respect through her performances. I can't wait for a studio album!"
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","Tarja's departure was in 2005. Floor's After Forever disbanded in 2006. I've been wishing for Floor to join Nightwish ever since. Took them way too long, but at least they got together in the end :-)"
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","When you think about it, After Forever is the reason we have Epica and Floor's Nightwish.

Not a huge fan of the band but hey, gotta admit they did a good job at finding some good talents :D"
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","I liked Anette until I saw her live.

Now I reserve judgement until I see Nightwish in concert again. 

My biggest problem is not the vocal, but that I didn't liked Imaginaerum."
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","The one thing I don't like about Floor + Nightwish is the circlejerk.

I have been unable to understand the amount of hype voiced in here. I never followed After Forever neither was I exposed to Floor's work before. And when I hear her perform I can't get what people are so fascinated with.

Maybe the fact that people where so vocal about how awesome they thought having Floor stepping in as the new vocalist was ruined it for me.

It's like when you are going to watch a movie and everybody tells you it the best movie ever and how awesome it its. Then you go watch it and even if its great, you are underwhelmed.

I'll reserve my judgement for when I hear a studio recording of her performance with Nightwish."
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","Did you pick up the Revamp release. Thats why people are excited about floor, she isn't a one trick poney. She has a myriad of different voices to offer toumas when he is writing music."
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","THIS! Tarja and Annette were both too limited in their vocals to really let Tuomas cut lose creatively."
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","I can see how fans have over-hyped Floor. 

I personally think it was because of all her work with After Forever and other things (like ReVamp, Ayreon, guest appearances with Epica, etc, etc.) At least that's what made me very excited about the prospect of Floor joining. My main criticism of Anette has always been that she was all wrong for their older work, she couldn't swing it without them having to make significant changes. Floor can.

That said, I'm a little sad that there's not too much sung in the opera-style, even with songs that used to be sung that way by Tarja. Seems like overall, they are just done with that type of style, even though Floor can properly sing it. I was excited to get opera vocals back, and they're kind of not back... so now I'm also waiting for a studio album before I get more (or less) excited about Floor+Nightwish. "
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","Totally agree about the operatic vocals. I can understand how Floor might want to make her own style, rather than emulating Tarja for now. Hopefully we'll get more as time goew by."
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","Tuomas said they'd go back to the operatic vocals ""occasionally"" but that he was keen to use all the other aspects of Floor's voice. So she might even be doing some growls."
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","I had never heard of Floor until she stepped into the Nightwish tour. In fact, I had only discovered Nightwish about a month before the North America tour started, loved the music, found out they're playing in San Francisco in a few weeks and bought tickets. Then the bomb dropped: new vocalist, she will only be performing with the band for the third time ever at the concert I'm going to. I did not have high expectations.

Loved the concert. Floor was amazing. Great stage presence, phenomenal voice."
"Now that Nightwish's released ""Showtime, Storytime"", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?","The biggest problem for me is that she absolutely cannot nail Amaranth. Her voice just can't get it, so she cheats."

"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","As the title says. What's your favorite album that came out this year?

My thread, my rules :D

1. Just one album, so think hard

2. If your album has already been listed, upboat and/or comment on it, don't list it again

3. Live albums allowed

We should have a nice list by the end of this experiment :D

(I'm still pondering this question myself, I'll reply when I've made up my mind)"
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","*Edit: As per OP's rules, don't upvote this post - just use it to consider what to post and then go and upvote /u/RiversOfAwesome post saying Showtime, Storytime :-)*

&amp;nbsp;

2013 was an incredible year for symphonic metal. Here are my top contenders to consider (in random order):

* Epica: ***Retrospect*** - a three hour long (!) live album celebrating 10 years of Epica
* ReVamp: ***Wild Card*** - it's great to see ReVamp going on, despite Floor Jansen being so busy
* Leaves' Eyes: ***Symphonies of the Night*** - their best (and heaviest) album yet, I personally think the title song is Liv's greatest performance ever
* Nightwish: ***Showtime, Storytime*** - an incredible performance of my favourite band with my favourite vocalist, this obviously has my vote for the year

And for the sake of completeness I'll mention these too:

* Within Temptation: *Paradise (What About Us?)* - not a full album, only an EP, but I wanted to mention it since it gave me some hope Within Temptation is moving back towards symphonic metal
* Tristania: *Darkest White* 
* Tarja: *Colours in the Dark*"
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","We can use this reply to ponder :D

I just want to get a general idea of what /r/symphonicmetal deems the best album of 2013.

Also, you can always upboat more than one album, but that would kind of defeat the purpose obviously heh. "
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","I think Sirenia - Perils of the Deep Blue and Serenity - War of Ages are strong contenders too :)"
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","&gt; Live albums allowed

It has to be Showtime, Storytime."
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","Agreed! I don't usually like live albums much at all but both Showtime, Storytime and Retrospect are great this year. But SS is definitely the one I'm going to listen to most, I just adore Floor's versions of the songs."
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","**Amaranthe - The Nexus**

Do they count as symphonic? not sure. If not: **Serenity - War of Ages**"
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","ReVamp - Wild Card

After mulling it over, I personally think this is the best symphonic metal album of 2013.. tho one could argue that it's prog metal I guess hehe."
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","Fleshgod Apocalypse's ""Labyrinth"" has me hands-down. And I wanted to pick one that wasn't so obvious.

My second choices are Orphaned Land's ""All is One"" and Shade Empire's ""Omega Arcane"". But don't upvote this for those. 

EDIT: Full album link for Labyrinth: http://youtu.be/EcjfCQp6WXU"
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","Labyrinth was personally a let-down for me.. Thought it just lacked energy despite being so grandiose in sound.. but the Shade Empire album was up there!"
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","Retrospect for me.

Showtime, Storytime is good too, but I think the show Epica put on at Retrospect is so much more fun to watch (and listen to). I think I've watched it like 3 times already and it's all I've been listening to."
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","Sirenia - Perils of the Deep Blue

Sirenia was one of the best bands in the genre and after a bit of eclipse really returned to form with this album that sounds a lot like old-school Sirenia, but fits perfectly Ailyn's vocals and Veland's screams.

Edit: [Seven Widows Weep] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGCxgJFjnZw)"
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","Yes for sure, this band's sound is fanatic is my go to for symphonic metal since Tarja left Nightwish. God, I love Ailyn's accent, too. Her voice calls to me just like a real siren's would. "
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","I second this, although only because no other album I liked was released this year, so it is practically the best album of 2013 for me, and I don't consider stuff like *Showtime, Storytime* or *Retrospect* as separate, new albums."
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","Old Mornings Dawn by Summoning."
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","Doing a revision of my fav 2013 albums but at the moment, it's **Avantasia - The Mystery of Time** for me (despite popular opinion that it's not that strong.. i think it's a magical journey!!). Runners up include Dark Moor and Shade Empire "
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","Keldian - Outbound"
"Best Album of 2013 according to you?","For me Retrospect takes the cake."

"Diablo Swing Orchestra - Jigsaw Hustle (brand new single)",""
"Diablo Swing Orchestra - Jigsaw Hustle (brand new single)","Finally new music from them!

P.S. Oh no the new singer drama has come to DSO.  I don't like her singing :(, Im going to miss Annlouice. Maybe her voice will grow on me.

"
"Diablo Swing Orchestra - Jigsaw Hustle (brand new single)","I was never a fan of Annlouice's operatic bits.  Sometimes she might have a good, powerful soprano part that might bring a more epic sound to a song, but most of the time her vocals felt out of place. Due to this, most of my favorite songs ended up being ones with male vocals. 

Personally, I think the new female singer is a great fit for the band. I can't wait to hear more of their new material."
"Diablo Swing Orchestra - Jigsaw Hustle (brand new single)","I think she's great. She's not meant to replace Annlouice anyway.

The song is awesome. It's really different from what I was expecting, but still sounds very much like DSO. Seems to have an Abba vibe to it.

I suppose this is the sort of thing they meant when they talked about disco music influences on the new album and whatnot.

Can't wait for the full thing to come out."
"Diablo Swing Orchestra - Jigsaw Hustle (brand new single)","I think the unexpected part of their music is what I like most of them. Once the ""fans"" get their heads out of the ""New singer = bad"" circlejerk, everyone is going to like it."
"Diablo Swing Orchestra - Jigsaw Hustle (brand new single)","it is just that DSO nowadays sounds like [insert the music genre here] + metal. They have lost the theatrical/operatic appeal. 

Annlouice vocals made the band more avant-garde (she sings a lot differently than Tarja and company that want to have an angelic voice), one fine example is her weird vocals in 'Lucy Fears The Morning Star'."
"Diablo Swing Orchestra - Jigsaw Hustle (brand new single)","Yeah, I know what you mean.

The theatrical/operatic parts were good, but it did seem like they wanted to move away from it over time. It was mostly present in The Butcher's Ballroom and played a lesser role in the 2 following albums.

The current setup they have seems to allow for more experimentation (Pandora's Piñata was a very good example of this, since it mixed a lot of different genres and influences).

But yeah, I do agree that Annlouice is very unique and superior in a bunch of ways to Tarja and other female metal singers."
"Diablo Swing Orchestra - Jigsaw Hustle (brand new single)","It's very different but I like the new singer, although I'm going to miss Annlouice like crazy, she had the raw power that I find a lot of symphonic metal singers are missing. Tarja has the perfect beautiful, gothic voice, but she can't shatter glass like Annluoice. But holy shit, the instrumental part is AMAZING. Some of the best I've heard from DSO. Love it."
"Diablo Swing Orchestra - Jigsaw Hustle (brand new single)","I liked the new singer more as the song went on.  But the beginning just didn't sound right to my ears.  Those first two lines actually sounded horrible.  Is it just me, or did the ""signs"" of ""secret signs"" sound off-key?"

"Floor Jansen (Nightwish) O mio babbino caro","I'm so glad she ended up with Nightwish and is getting more fans. I always knew that she was way too good to fade into obscurity after After Forever broke up. "
"Floor Jansen (Nightwish) O mio babbino caro","I didn't know her until I found a video at wacken. I think she is wayyyy better than any of the old nightwish's singer so far. It's only a matter of opinion though, she totally blew me away with her presence and voice!!"
"Floor Jansen (Nightwish) O mio babbino caro","She is the singer nightwish needs right now, but Nightwish would have never became what they are now with her.

Her voice is great but not as special as Tarja's (or even Anette for that matter, even if I can't stand it ...). Coming in now she sounds great on songs not written for her voice AT ALL and thats quite unique."
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.",""
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","Just out of curiosity, are there any Epica fans here that are catholic? If so, how do feel about this song and their other songs that deal with religion? "
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","I grew up Catholic. I think the music is beautiful, obviously. As far as lyrical content, I don't really ""handle"" it differently than I do any other song. It's an expression of the writer's thoughts and feelings. And you know what, the Church has historically really fumbled on handling the pedophilia situation, and I know it has really hurt a lot of people. They have every right to express their opinions on the matter. I actually have grown to really like the ""spiritual"" messages of their songs, the scientific aspects of ""we are all connected"". So basically, it does not turn me off to their music. I don't really listen to the music for the lyrics anyway, music always comes first for me."
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","I am way late to this conversation but I think what you wrote was really well said
"
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","I'm a Catholic Epica fan.  I think that some of the criticisms in their lyrics are valid.  Ultimately, they're entitled to hold their views and to put them forwards, even though I don't like the assumption that seems to be a few of their songs that religious people are just gullible idiots.  Anyway, whether or not I am comfortable with the lyrics of any given song, I enjoy the music."
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","[Context](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/vatican-paedophilia-scandal-archbishop-jozef-wesolowski-stored-over-100000-child-porn-videos-1467410).  For those of you who don't know the song's lyrics, they're a condemnation of the Catholic Church for enabling pedophiles. 

Also, Simone Simons was 18 when this song was released.  There's something very appealing about an 18 year old calling the entire Catholic Church out on its bullshit."
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","I fucking hate this song, and I think it's popularity is a mark against the fan bases of both Epica and symphonic metal in general. It's so stupid, obvious, preachy, self-righteous, melodramatic, and of course the growls are indisputably awful. Not to mention the fact that it comes across as a shallow imitation of previous After Forever work (and other gothic bands like Tristania.) Epica have improved *tremendously* since their debut.

I can't even listen to this song on speakers; it's too embarrassing. "
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","&gt; stupid

It's hard to address this, since I'm not sure what you're referring to.

&gt; obvious

Damn. Well, I will admit that I certainly had no clue what the song was about until I looked it up.

&gt; preachy, self-righteous

First of all, they're talking about the Catholic Church, which is arguably the most preachy and self-righteous organization in history. Second of all, they're decrying abuse of children at the hands of people who are supposed to protect them. If that's preachy and self-righteous, then we need more of that kind of preachiness and self-righteousness in the world.

&gt; melodramatic

This genre is always dramatic, and this particular song isn't exactly making a mountain out of a molehill.  The problem is undoubtedly a big one, and it needs to be addressed.

&gt; and of course the growls are indisputably awful.

I actually agree with you on this, but I dislike growls in general.

&gt; Not to mention the fact that it comes across as a shallow imitation of previous After Forever work (and other gothic bands like Tristania.)

No comment. I've listened to very little After Forever, and even less Tristania, though I'm currently trying to fix both of those problems.
"
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","Am I the only one around here who actually loves the growls on this song? The first time I listened to this, I didn't like growl vocals in general yet I loved them in this song."
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","Yeah I actually really like the growls in this song, I always look forward to them when I listen to it."
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","Yes! I didnt like growling vocals much when I started listening to Epica, but loved them for some reason on this track."
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","The first two albums by After Forever were largely written by Mark Jansen. It's no surprise early After Forever and early Epica sound very similar."
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","You definitely need to listen to early After Forever, especially the album *Decipher*. IMO it's one of the greatest albums in the symphonic gothic genre, and definitely a humongous influence on the first Epica album. The founder of Epica was a guitarist on that album, and he actually founded Epica after he was kicked out of the band. Sort of a Metallica-Megadeth type of story, except I somehow doubt Jansen was as much of an asshole as Mustaine :)"
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","Sorry you feel that way, but just be aware that hundreds of thousands of Epica fans disagree with you. This is one of their most played songs on tours (I think even #1 most played, with Consign to Oblivion being the only possible rival I can think of), because so many people love it. I personally didn't like the growling in Epica music at all when I first heard Epica on my Nightwish Pandora station, but Cry for the Moon was the song that finally won me over. And here I am today, considering Epica to be my favorite band."
"Epica - Cry for the Moon. As relevant now as ever.","Man, don't I know it. The popularity of this song is like rubbing salt in my wound! That's why I hate it instead of being merely indifferent. There are plenty of weaker Epica tracks out there, but this is the only one that gets under my skin.

"Evanescence - Lacrymosa [3:36] (from Mozart's Requiem)","Pretty bold choice for them to add vocals to this song; the conversion process is hard enough to do justice. 

Symphony X also did a version of lacrymosa, though they combined it with an original song as well. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLgzjKpmLm0"
"Evanescence - Lacrymosa [3:36] (from Mozart's Requiem)","Love that drum solo!  I listened to this track far too many times in college; it's a pity Rullo doesn't get to go wild like this in the band's other stuff.

The ""Lacrymosa"" part itself doesn't really grab me, though.  It feels tacked on, and they don't really deliver on the part everybody wants to hear, sort of like covering Handel's *Messiah* and not doing the Halleluja chorus.

"Epica - The Phantom Agony (Clip from Retrospect)","Some may say (and I kinda agree) that Simone lost a bit of her voice while she was pregnant. But those headbangs are still godlike \o/"
"Epica - The Phantom Agony (Clip from Retrospect)","I, contrary to popular believe, think this (Retrospect) was one of Simone's worst performances. Her voice is simply not what it used to be. I saw them last November and her performance was rather mediocre; there wasn't much breath control, her tone was a bit too nasal, and she was sometimes off key. The whole Retrospect concept is great, but at least IMO, Simone's performance wasn't that great. Also the light/laser show could have been taken down a notch. 

Edit: Because I hate using my cellphone to comment."
"Epica - The Phantom Agony (Clip from Retrospect)","I actually agree, her voice was so beautiful and now it seems she has lost it. People simply wanna believe this is because of her pregnancy more than believing symphonic metal has lost one of its queens :/
But I still believe I have never seen someone headbange in a more perfect way than she can."
"Epica - The Phantom Agony (Clip from Retrospect)","Hmm, I don't really have any evidence or musical experience to back this up, but I actually thought her singing on Retrospect was a lot better than the last time I saw her sing live."
"Epica - The Phantom Agony (Clip from Retrospect)","I could be exaggerating out of disappointment. As I aforementioned, Retrospect was a great concept, I mean it was the 10 year anniversary! But for me what's really disappointing is that in those ten years Simone's singing technique has plummeted. Simone has one of the most beautiful mezzo-soprano lyric voices I've heard, but after she switched and started singing in a rockish manner, which apparently she can't support well, her live performances have gone downhill. Sorry if I might be over analyzing this, but I've been studying singing for a while now and it's just painful to see someone with a beautiful voice misuse it and potentially ruin it. "
"Epica - The Phantom Agony (Clip from Retrospect)","She definitely sounds like she struggles with her current style of singing. I've only really been a fan for about 5 years so I just thought she wasn't that good at singing live, but then when I watched some videos from The Phantom Agony era she sounded a lot better. I really like both styles of singing (Floor Jansen can switch between the two easily) so I have no problem with the style, but you're right, it doesn't sound like it's good for her voice."
"Epica - The Phantom Agony (Clip from Retrospect)","Even in the [DYU](http://youtu.be/SfboLVmP2WM) era she was doing better than what she's been doing lately. Floor is a perfect example  of someone who is very disciplined and dedicated with her voice. She's constantly learning new ways and techniques of exploiting her voice, it's admirable. I guess Simone just needs more discipline, but with her new duty as a Mom, I'm not sure that's going to happen lol. "
"Epica - The Phantom Agony (Clip from Retrospect)","Indeed, haha. Actually at the MFVF recently the only singer I heard warming up a lot backstage was Floor... I don't know if that means she's the only one doing it or perhaps more likely that she's the one with the best voice projection!"

"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","Yes, they often play with Palestinian bands, too. Many of their songs are centered around peace n'stuff"
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","They're Israelis, and whilst this song is in Arabic, they release most of their other stuff in English or Herbrew

One of my favourites is this song, [Sapari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUi1yf97paw), which is sung in Hebrew"
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","That isn't actually Hebrew...as a native Hebrew speaker I couldn't understand a single word of it when I first heard the song.
It more of an old [yemanite-hebrew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemenite_Hebrew).

I can understand it mostly when reading the lyrics (which are written in Hebrew)

(The 2nd part is obviously English :) )

by the way, this song is the metal version of an ancient Yemenite folk poem/song, here's a folk guitar version:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4xeihxVtE8


Orphaned land is one of my all time favorite bands, I love all their music, from the old demos, very badly produced but still awesome black/death metal years, through the recent more soft melodic albums.
(Luckily these had much better production value, heck - Steven Wilson produced ""The Never Ending Way of ORWarriOR"" for them)"
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","This is awesome.

Reminds me of Myrath, as well as a bit of Opeth (especially the outro/coda section) and some of Epica's oriental-sounding stuff."
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","I really dig this.  How's the rest of their material?
"
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","I just found this band, so my knowledge of their music isn't very comprehensive yet. But it appears that they have more of a progressive metal focus for most of their discography. It's still very good from the little that I've heard, but it is different than this song. 

But their latest album ""All is One"" is consistently in the style of this song. I've listened to that whole album and I LOVE it. Such good lyrics too! "
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","As a big fan of progmetal and symphonic metal, I think I'm going to really like this band. Nice find, OP!"
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","Much of their other albums vocals are actually growls, but this album (All is One) is purely clean vocals and is, in my opinion, their greatest one. Ive listened to it countless times."
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","Wow this is really good. I will definitely be buying their music."
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","The video for All Is One shows the lead guitarist with some crazy mandolin hybrid thing, never seen one before

[All Is One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bds3FALcR7M)"
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","Hmm. Not bad at all. Not something I'd listen to all the time, it's a bit depressing, but still like it."
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","How about [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya81NOhdd2E)-- less depressing? Or [this more acoustic one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92hJ09tIung)

Of course, one of the most depressing songs ever written is [Beloved's Cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIbKKew0UFc). "
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","[deleted]"
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","This is a really interesting sound.

I used to work in Riyadh Saudi Arabia and spent a while looking for music like this. Couldn't find a damn thing. But then again, when I bought myself a guitar to keep myself occupied (Fender Strat, no less!) the strings were covered, and the shop keeper wouldn't let me try before buying.  I could try one of the keyboards if I wanted. Just not that evil Western guitar thingy."
"Arabic Symphonic Metal: Orphaned Land - Children - [7:14]","Listening to The Beloved's Cry - 20th Anniversary Edition which is a collection of their earlier demos. A little more black metally with the oriental prog sound. Check it out, its very good and a bit different from their newer stuff."

I'm still waiting on the US special edition to be announced - I'm not sure if there are any other countries that get their own special bundles or editions.  There's also a full article of this [on my blog](http://hapfairy.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/where-to-buy-nightwishs-endless-forms.html) with pictures and links, if anyone's interested.

Please comment here if you spot any that I've missed!"
"Nightwish - Endless Forms Most Beautiful and Élan editions","Went ahead and put in an order for the splatter vinyl /hipster

Don't want miss out on the 500 copies and not sure if will come to the U.S. Nuclear Blast and can't wait to get it signed next year."
"Nightwish - Endless Forms Most Beautiful and Élan editions","That one does look particularly cool!"
"Nightwish - Endless Forms Most Beautiful and Élan editions","I find the title so stupid... but the other CDs did not have much better titels and I am very excited for the new CD! OMG Floor Jansen + Nightwish must be amazing. And, the evolution theme of the lyrics really speaks to me. Can't wait!
"
"Nightwish - Endless Forms Most Beautiful and Élan editions","Yeah, I wasn't really impressed with the title. I would've preferred it be ""Journey of Grandeur"" like it was speculated. Nevertheless, I'm extremely excited about the release. "
"Nightwish - Endless Forms Most Beautiful and Élan editions","I don't understand. Does this mean that certain editions will have songs that we won't see on other editions? I usually just buy their music from iTunes and am afraid I may miss some songs :(. "
"Nightwish - Endless Forms Most Beautiful and Élan editions","Well, the 2CD edition comes with an instrumental CD (which I assume is the whole album in instrumental), while the 3CD edition comes with both instrumental and orchestral CDs. Those might get put up on iTunes, but it's hard to say without any confirmation.

Other than that, we don't know yet - no tracklists have been revealed! But sometimes bands have different bonus tracks that are exclusive to certain editions (Epica do that a lot - there were several of their songs I missed because they were iTunes exclusive or North American exclusive etc). Nightwish usually only do a couple of bonus tracks though, so they'll probably be easy to get hold of.



"
"Nightwish - Endless Forms Most Beautiful and Élan editions","Ah okay thank you!  Yes it really frustrates me that Epica did that. I would pay for all of those bonus tracks if I could buy them somewhere! I guess I'll wait and see what Nightwish does. "
"Nightwish - Endless Forms Most Beautiful and Élan editions","&gt; it really frustrates me that Epica did that

I'm pretty sure it's Nuclear Blast's fault for putting different bonus tracks on certain editions; I don't think the members of Epica planned it that way, but I could be wrong. After all, it's the labels that own rights to the music, unfortunately."
"Nightwish - Endless Forms Most Beautiful and Élan editions","Yea probably. Not frustrated with the band. Love them :). Just sad that I can't have all the songs :("

"Tuomas Holopainen says the new Nightwish album will be ""something a bit more simple, a bit back in time""","I highly doubt they will go back to the Oceanborn/Wishmaster however I can see something similar to Wishmaster happen especially if Floor ends up permanently joining the band 

*edit: I actually meant to say century child lol. good realizing me"
"Tuomas Holopainen says the new Nightwish album will be ""something a bit more simple, a bit back in time""","I was wondering if it would be something like Century Child, still with an orchestra but with a bit more focus on the band. But who knows :)"
"Tuomas Holopainen says the new Nightwish album will be ""something a bit more simple, a bit back in time""","Nightwish's last album, Imaginaerum, wasn't that great. Even when I heard it with the movie it didn't work. The instrumentals were great, but got tiring after a while.

If by 'back to basics', they mean Tarja, I'll be ecstatic. If by 'back to basics', they mean Dark Passion Play, I'll be pleased. Anything 'back to basics' is good.

This group is the only actual metal group that I've stuck to from the first day I heard their music (Over the Hills And Far Away about 4 years ago). I have faith in this group. Tuomas has, can and will take this band places. Go Nightwish, looking forwards to your new album!"
"Tuomas Holopainen says the new Nightwish album will be ""something a bit more simple, a bit back in time""","I quite enjoy Imaginaerum, but then I'm a sucker for the grand orchestral sound. It's great background music when you're writing that 30-page paper at two in the morning... ;)"
"Tuomas Holopainen says the new Nightwish album will be ""something a bit more simple, a bit back in time""","Definitely agree with this, I mean, I love Imaginaerum as it is, but the orchestral version and The Score are brilliant writing music."
"Tuomas Holopainen says the new Nightwish album will be ""something a bit more simple, a bit back in time""","It was a good album, but there were a few songs that didn't fit with the band's reputation.
Taiktalvi
Slow, Love, Slow

And, imo, it just didn't live up to my Nightwish expectations. Oddly enough, I love, love, love The Crow, The Owl And The Dove. It's the one song on the entire album (Aside from the aforementioned songs) that none of my friends expected me to like. "

"Tuomas Holopainen says the new Nightwish album will be ""something a bit more simple, a bit back in time""","Dark Passion Play was pretty good imo"
"Tuomas Holopainen says the new Nightwish album will be ""something a bit more simple, a bit back in time""","Dark Passion Play is in my top favourite albums of all time! It's also the bestselling NW album ever. I think people underestimate its popularity because those who dislike Anette tend to be more vocal about it. My favourite tracks would have to be The Poet And The Pendulum, 7 Days to the Wolves, Escapist and The Islander."
"Tuomas Holopainen says the new Nightwish album will be ""something a bit more simple, a bit back in time""","I thought Amaranth was alright, but  she tried to do the stuff Tarja did and it didn't work. The Islander is one of my favourite songs, however. "
"Tuomas Holopainen says the new Nightwish album will be ""something a bit more simple, a bit back in time""","From that album I liked Sahara and 7 days to the wolves best. Everything else still isn't that bad."

"Tarja - 500 Letters","You know, I absolutely loved Tarja in Nightwish. Ghost love score, wanderlust, Nemo, the siren, crownless, two for tragedy, she is my sin, and even the Phantom of the Opera cover. All fantastic and my favorites of all western music.

I just can't get into her solo stuff. The lyrics don't paint the same picture, and the music isn't as colorful of a backdrop for her fantastic voice. And I really miss that over the top operatic style from the aforementioned songs. Still, I wish her well, since she's still one of my favorite singers of all time. "
"Tarja - 500 Letters","I think one of the reasons for the lack of depth might be that most of her songs are written by a [Swedish pop band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_\(band\)) and others by different songwriters. She does contribute though, I'd be really interested to know  how much she works on them. She has written three ballads at least."

"The song that started it all: Believer - Dies Irae, the first ever symphonic metal song","Believer is a band that has inspired quite a few other bands, but no one has ever heard of them... but do you really think this song ""started it all?"" Symphonic metal did not exist before 1990? I guess I don't know that much history...

I always thought that Extol was the best ""style baby"" of Believer. [Example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44sUpTBooDs) On their first two albums, they had some strings even, though not a full symphonic feel. [Example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qS9xUkbkag)

Edit: Just read the [wikipedia article on symphonic metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphonic_metal). Looks like you're right... Believer was first, then Therion and Waltari, then Nightwish, and then everybody! I guess I was around and following the birth of Symphonic metal while it happened and didn't even realize it!

"The song that started it all: Believer - Dies Irae, the first ever symphonic metal song","Therion was the first true symphonic metal band. I have read in several places that this song was one of the main things that inspired them to change from death metal and go in a more symphonic/operatic direction. If you listen, you can hear a lot of the characteristics that are present in Therion's work.  If you want to go way back, I suppose that you could also cite Led Zeppelin's Kashmir and Rainbow's Stargazer as early examples of symphonic metal as well but I feel like this song really started the modern symphonic metal sound. "

Even earlier (1973), some of the Ozzy era Black Sabbath songs were symphonic metal. They literally were metal with symphonic elements. [Spiral Architect(1973)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFH1gNsARw), [Supertzar(1975)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ska3C80ysk)

So far (using UK/EU prices) the cheapest I've found is £9.38 for the single CD from Play while the most expensive is the €109.00 mega bundle from the Webshop. I decided to go for the Earbook from RecordStoreUK in the end. Which will you be getting? "

I'm probably gonna get the digipack with the shirt and all that stuff for $35, might switch down to just the $10 album if money is tight.

I wish they had exact shipping dates and could estimate the time of arrival. I'm leaving college right around the week of May 18th so I don't know where I should ship it to.

Excited for it nonetheless."

"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","So this is kind of strange, but I'm not a huge Nightwish fan ^^^please ^^^don't ^^^hate ^^^me  

I am a fan, just not a huge one. Help me change that. I want to get ready for their new album and explore their music a little more closely. I'm a huge fan of Floor and of After Forever (and ReVamp) so I really want to put in effort and familiarize myself with their discography. I have heard most of their popular songs (Ghost Love Score, Romanticide, I Want My Tears Back, Nemo, etc.), but I haven't really given their other songs a chance, which is weird because I'm a fan of a lot of symphonic metal bands (some popular and some obscure). I guess I just never cared to really take the time and listen to Nightwish (who many consider to be one of the best symphonic metal bands). 

So in your opinion, how would you rate their 7 albums from best to worst. Thanks!"
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","Each one of their albums is pretty different, so they'll appeal differently to everyone. I think the four latest albums are all simply great no matter what though.

My rating would be:

1. Dark Passion Play
2. Imaginaerum
3. Century Child
4. Once
5. Wishmaster
6. Oceanborn
7. Angels Fall First.

You mentioned 4 songs as their most popular, and three are from a single album, Once. Might be that one album is not perfect for your tastes. Try *The Poet and the Pendulum* and *Last of the Wilds* from Dark Passion Play, *Ghost River* from Imaginaerum, *End of All Hope* and *Ocean Soul* from Century Child. But I'd recommend listening to the albums as a whole, especially Century Child and Imaginaerum, they come pretty close to concept albums, and listening to just individual songs will not do the albums justice."
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","I think it's unlikely that we'll all agree, haha. Given the songs you've said that you like, I would recommend listening in reverse chronological order, i.e Imaginaerum -&gt; DPP -&gt; Once and so on. I would definitely recommend watching the Showtime, Storytime DVD as well, since you're a fan of Floor. Her performance is wonderful.

Here's my personal ranking, although I change my mind a lot, especially about the first 3. They're all pretty perfect to my mind.

1. Once 
2. Imaginaerum 
3. Dark Passion Play 
4. Wishmaster 
5. Century Child 
6. Oceanborn 
7. Angels Fall First "

This. Floor does an amazing job on Showtime, Storytime."
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","&gt; This. Floor does an amazing job on Showtime, Storytime.

In person she was fucking awesome, and it was only her 3rd or so show when I saw her.  I actually coughed up the money for the most expensive concert tickets I've ever bought--VIP for their tour next May.  (I saw them with Annette 3-4 times, and sadly never saw them with Tarja in person.)"
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","NW have had a bit of a stylistic change over the years. The first three albums or so are symphonic power metal, meaning they were blistering fast, melodic, and catchy. Ever since *Century Child* though, they've gone more towards a plain symphonic metal sound, basically meaning they've slowed their music down a bit and they've turned up the symphonic parts. You really can't get a better idea of what NW's sound is nowadays that by listening to *Imaginaerum* and *Dark Passion Play*. But coming from a power metal fan, I find that some of the material from *Wishmaster* and *Oceanborn* is miles better than what they did with Anette. I'll include my favorite song from each album (that you may not have heard) as an indicator as to the overall sound of the album.

My Ranking:

1. [*Wishmaster*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t8MbnWGcWc)

2. [*Oceanborn*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7Oj3tyyTxQ)

3. [*Once*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52LpN5aIb3U)

4. [*Imaginaerum*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukDEYRXoH2g)

5. [*Century Child*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZUQ3xhmu_A)

6. [*Dark Passion Play*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv6TIub6DfQ)

7. [*Angels Fall First*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVAOXgNoX-8)"
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","Hey, I just recently got into this genre, and your post makes me think we have very similar tastes (My opinion is almost identical)

Can you recommend me any other symphonic power metal bands?"
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","Sure thing.

* [Epica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy5XTIFcKU8) - They use both harsh male vocals and operatic female vocals. They're often one of the first bands people check out after Nightwish due to the similar sound.

* [Xandria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGTAmmTiD_Y) - Probably the closest thing to NW's power metal era. Fast, bombastic, and energetic are all good ways to describe their music. 

* [Diabulus in Musica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzPESD5GGig) - Similar in style to Epica, but I just thought their 2014 album, *Argia*, was really good, so I'm including them.

* [Damnation Angels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmy0y8U7vjE) - I don't know if you wanted any male-fronted bands, but Damnation Angels' most recent album is absolutely one I'd recommend you listen to, especially if the fantasy, over-the-top bands like Rhapsody of Fire and Dragonland aren't to your liking.

* [Ancient Bards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxnlx_TgRpI) - Pretty much a female-fronted version of [Rhapsody of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxGu5HjarmU).

* [Serenity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_8XUhfnv2g) - Clean male and female vocals. They're very similar in style to [Kamelot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7x5l2FK5N8), if you're familiar with them."
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","Hm, I have enjoyed what I've heard from xandria and epica, I'll check out the others!"
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","Excellent suggestions. I really love all of those bands."
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","Note on Xandria... only their latest two releases are like that. prior to that they are more like tristania/sirenia."
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","I had originally listened to a couple random Xandria songs back in the day of the India album (mostly Widescreen), but never paid much attention to them since.  I saw them doing all new material a month or two back and it was pretty good.  I just need to run through the last couple albums sometime and see if something really gets my attention."
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","[deleted]"
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","I would recommend Delain as well, very good band"
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","Heh, actually I rank them in reverse chronology, with the exception of Oceanborn and Wishmaster. So something like this:

1. Imaginaerum
2. Dark Passion Play
3. Once
4. Century Child
5. Oceanborn
6. Wishmaster
7. Angels Fall First"
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","I'm going to agree with you on this.  Tuomas' compositions just get better and better.  Hell, I think his solo album this year has been the best release of 2014 that I've purchased."
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","Can't wait for the new album. Having Floor and Troy as permanent members as well as the apparent evolution/science theme and Richard Dawkins on the album is all pretty exciting."
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","`1. Oceanborn`  
`2. Angels Fall First`  
`3. Century Child/Wishmaster/Once (all roughly equal IMO)`  
`6. Dark Passion Play`  
`7. Imaginaerum `  "
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","May I congratulate you on being different! You are the only one not to list 'Angels fall first' last. (13 comments posted atm)"
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","imaginaerium is probably their best. The most well thought out and the most creative."
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","Seems like we all have different opinions:

1. Oceanborn
2. Once
3. Century Child
4. Wishmaster
5. Dark Passion Play
6. Imaginaerum
7. Angels Fall First

I love all of Nightwish's albums, even Angels Fall First, but it is arguably the worst. Tuomas's vocals plus the worst lyrics, and the most cheaply put together."
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","Oh god, I already see this thread escalating terribly.

Whatever, my ranking would look somehow like this:

* 1. Imaginaerum
* 2. Century Child
* 3. Dark Passion Play
* 4. Wishmaster
* 5. Once
* 6. Angels fall first
* 7. Oceanborn [no hate please]"
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","Man, just all of them. I wanted people to tell me their favourites when I got into Symphonic Metal, but the best thing to do it just listen. Chuck it on while you work. Try to remember songs and albums that tickle your fancy the most."
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","It's all subject to opinion, but for me:

1. Century Child (top songs Slaying the Dreamer and Beauty of the Beast)
2. Once (top songs Romanticide and Ghost Love Score)
3. Dark Passion Play (top songs Poet and the Pendulum and Sahara)
4. Imaginaerum (top songs Ghost River and I Want My Tears Back)
5. Oceanborn (top songs Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean and The Pharaoh Sails to Orion)
6. Angels Fall First (top songs Astral Romance and Angels Fall First)
7. Wishmaster (no top songs, I'm least familiar with this album among them all)"
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","I would say....

Dark Passion Play

Century Child

Oceanborn

Once

Imaginaerum

Wishmaster

Angels Fall First


Honestly though, a lot of these are interchangeable with the exception of AFF being my least favourite."
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","I think my order will surprise most.

1. Oceanborn
2. Century Child
3. Dark Passion Play
4. Wishmaster
5. Once
6. Angels Fall First
7. Imaginaerum

With this order, it shows why I'm on the fence about a new album, and yes, that includes knowing Floor Jansen will be doing vocals.

Also note that slots 2 to 4 can change depending on how I feel, which way the wind blows, if Top Spin works, etc."
"Can you rank Nightwish's albums for me?","I didn't start listening to NW until Once.  Other than a couple random songs (like Wishmaster or their cover of Over the Hills and Far Away) I never could get into their older stuff.  So with that limit:

1. Once
2. Imaginaerum
3. Dark Passion Play

I will say that now that many of Floor's live performances have been released I have a hard time listening to the original album versions of any of those songs.  

Annette tried, but she just wasn't a good fit.  For DPP we had no other reference point for the sounds of those songs (can't really count Marco's demos), and she did them okay.  Watching her live in person doing older material though was cringe-worthy.  The fact that they completely re-wrote Nemo into their live 'acoustic' version just for her helps demonstrate that.  Floor gave DPP and Imaginaerum the performances they deserved from the beginning.


Even for Tarja's stuff, I prefer Floor's versions, and I rarely want to listen to live recordings over studio recordings.  My only regret so far is that when I saw Floor live it was only her 3rd or so show and didn't have Ghost Love Score (my favorite) worked into it yet.  The releases of her performance of that blow away Tarja, at least in my opinion.

I never got into After Forever much, just a couple random songs.  Nothing wrong with it, just most didn't really stand out to me enough to obsess over."
"Therion - Schwarzalbenheim",""
"Does After Forever ever drop the death grunts?","I have no idea if I am in the minority, but I can't stand it when symphonic metal bands add death grunts to their songs.  Within Temptation did it on their first album(and I think once in their latest one) and I don't find it to be a feature that vibes with the genre.

Anyway, with Floor joining Nightwish, I figured I should check out the discography of her previous band, After Forever. I've been disappointed they frequently have death grunts in the music. 

Does this always remain so, or did they remove that aspect later? Thanks."
"Does After Forever ever drop the death grunts?","They remain. Slightly less on the final After Forever album. She does them herself when performing live with ReVamp, and does them excellently! "
"Does After Forever ever drop the death grunts?","/u/ColumbosMissus already answered your question, but I'm curious; do you not like death grunts at all or just in symphonic metal? "
"Does After Forever ever drop the death grunts?","At all, anymore. I was into death metal back in the early to mid-90's, though."
"Does After Forever ever drop the death grunts?","They have plenty fantastic songs without any growls at all. For some good examples, check their 2004 Pinkpop gig, which is on Youtube.

I personally absolutely love Life's Vortex, for instance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GneGW8d9viE

Eccentric. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnziUz49hY&amp;list=UUPyvd5tLK9eZ_SdgonmQGDA

And especially Through Square Eyes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjE1lSEzVU


Just don't dismiss them too quickly judging by a few of their songs which have growls in them. Like I said, there's plenty for everyone. Also, please, please, check out Floor's current band, ReVamp. They already did two fantastic albums. The second has some growls too, but not too much (not every song), and she does them herself, too! It's also not really symphonic metal, but rather progressive I guess with some songs having some symphonic elements to them (like operatic singing). Their album ""Wild Card"" is one of the best female fronted metal albums I've ever heard, and I'm into this stuff since I was ~9 (which was about 15 years ago)."
"Does After Forever ever drop the death grunts?","I will check out those things and while I haven't written them off, it's a bit of a pain to go through and delete all tracks with grunting. 

"
"Does After Forever ever drop the death grunts?","They did a poppy, easy listening album called Remagine (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remagine). There's not a lot of grunting there, but it's not very symphonic either.

Their final album, self titled After Forever, is also low on grunts and a much better album in general (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Forever_(album)). Check out the song Dreamflight for clean male vocals."
"Does After Forever ever drop the death grunts?","*Remagine* is ok, but mostly because Floor does amazing in some songs. She really carries that album. I think *After Forever* is their best album, followed by *Invisible Circles*."
