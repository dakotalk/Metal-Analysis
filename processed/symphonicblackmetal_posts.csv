"Gojira;  Heaviest Matter of the Universe","Great song, but this is in no way symphonic black metal"
"Gojira;  Heaviest Matter of the Universe","What genre would you categorize this as?  Aside from Extreme Metal, which pretty much everything seems to fit into."
"Gojira;  Heaviest Matter of the Universe","Check out [Encyclopaedia Metallum](http://www.metal-archives.com/), they have every metal band known to man on there (death/metalcore not included). This is pretty much the universally accepted ""encyclopedia"" of metal bands. In this case, they define Gojira -- whom I fucking love btw, I've been listening to their two most recent albums at work -- as ""Progressive/Groove/Death Metal."" They are hard to define, but there's no doubt they're a progressive *something.* Personally I would almost call them post-death metal, in the same way At the Drive-In is post-hardcore, but I don't think such a genre has been ""created."" "
"Gojira;  Heaviest Matter of the Universe","Thanks:  I'll go check it out.  It's nice that there can be some certainty/agreement about classification."

"Trying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?","I have tried in the past to get into this genre, but i really cannot find anything that I liked. One of the main complaints i had was (what you always hear...) the production quality of some albums. I understand it adds to the experience and whatnot, but i just have to have decent quality or the experience is ruined for me. All that was to say, what are some good symphonic black metal bands you would reccommend to a new listener?"
"Trying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?","Here is a list of some of my favorites.. 

* Abigail Williams - [In the Shadow of a Thousand Suns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux9LX82lqvU&amp;list=ALNb4maWNoT6S5T2YqD_CPQMx13cuQET0_)
* Advent Sorrow - [Before the Dimming Light](http://adventsorrow.bandcamp.com/album/before-the-dimming-light-ep)
* Carach Angren - [Death Came Through a Phantom Ship](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDIQW21EbKA&amp;list=PLB7ED862D4890596C)
* Dimmu Borgir - [In Sorte Diaboli](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2a1IfoZdGU&amp;list=PL736F69890A4A4BFC)"
"Trying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?","Carach angren"
"Trying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?","Especially Where the Corpses Sink Forever. Seems much cleaner and more well produced than their other albums"
"Trying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?","They get better every album"
"Trying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?","Ive never heard of this band before I saw it in this post. Now I cant stop listening to em"

"Trying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?","Lol well I see that now"
"Trying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?","Enjoy"
"Trying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?","Start with Dimmu Borgir's Abrahadabra. The production quality is great. Gateways is my favorite song by far, with an amazing climax."
"Trying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?","I don't want to step all over your opinion. But please do not do this..

Personally I feel like the quality of that band dropped significantly after ""In Sorte Diaboli"". Two incredibly important people in that band left before Abrahadabra. The release of that album was probably the most disappointing releases I've ever heard."
"Trying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?","That's a great opinion, buddy, but I'll do as I please."
"Trying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?","No one does it better than Dimmu Borgir! "
"Trying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?","All the Vesania albums are well produced, fire frost arcanum being my favorite. Abigail Williams gets a lot of hate but any of their albums after the legend ep are solid releases. The first 3 grave worm albums are good too. There's also some more recent bands like aquilius, advent sorrow and Saturnian."

If it's Vortex' harmonies that juxtapose the screaming, then I'd recommend Arcturus, listen to ""the chaos path"" on YouTube.

"Just a little rant defending Dimmu Borgir's music.","I just really don't understand everyone's hate for Dimmu Borgir. Sure, it's not textbook for the genre, but that makes them different. Some people hate on their later albums for being to heavy in the symphony. If that's you're argument, then you have no place to judge, it's not your piece of pie and that's OK. You're only comparing apples and oranges if you're going to argue. 

Some say the symphony drowns out some of the more catchy riffs. Listening through the album very carefully I did notice a few (a very small few) moments where that holds true, but the symphony was good enough to make up for it. Once again if this is your problem, apples and oranges.

The most valid argument: the symphony score and essentially the biggest credit to most songs was written by someone else, so they basically paid someone else to write the music. Okay, I admit I was actually really disappointed when I found out the members of Dimmu pretty much had nothing to do the symphony. While this may be true, I think their songwriting on top of it is great. So even if you discredit the members of Dimmu, you can't discredit the music its self.

If you listen the Abrahadabra or Death Cult Armageddon or In Sorte Diaboli, with no expectations for bindings to genre, I don't see how you can hate it that much. I honestly think the main reason Dimmu Borgir is hated so much in the black metal community is that they're successful. They went outside the norm, changed things up and became the best selling band in their field."
"Just a little rant defending Dimmu Borgir's music.","Their old stuff is cool, it's a good thing you posted this here instead of r/blackmetal... you would have been downvoted to heaven (its funny because black metal)"
"Just a little rant defending Dimmu Borgir's music.","*facepalm*, but yes I agree"

"Just a little rant defending Dimmu Borgir's music.","I really like old Dimmu. They changed their music and image to something that I think makes them look and sound pretty silly.

I hear what you're saying though, new DB isn't nearly as bad as most people make it out to be. Just not my thing."
"Just a little rant defending Dimmu Borgir's music.","Exactly. Thank you so much for saying that. ""Just not my thing"". That's just it."
"Just a little rant defending Dimmu Borgir's music.","There's nothing wrong with any music anyone listens to, it's all based on taste. We all have our own elitist moments and judge bands too harshly. Maybe some are just being elitist because they don't want to be singled out by others or maybe they're just afraid of trying out new sounds. Everyone has them, but it doesn't mean YOU have to stop listening to what you want to listen to.  
If someone bashes your music then they're just shallow, if you bash their music back then you're just as shallow as them. We all just need to accept that there's all types of different flavors. We will get nowhere bickering about who's better or who sucks, it's all opinion.

edit: Also, Dimmu grew outside of the box and made actual money off their recordings just like Cradle of Filth. If you're angry because someone expanded on a genre and made it mainstream then you're just a cunt. That's all musicians and bands do, expand on their sound. Just because a band makes a break or ends up on a Top 50 list doesn't mean they sold out, they're making a living doing what they love and I think that's all anyone could ever ask for."
"Just a little rant defending Dimmu Borgir's music.","Well said."
"Just a little rant defending Dimmu Borgir's music.","Thanks man! I just love music and hate seeing it ripped apart all of the time. I listen to copious amounts of genre's and people give me shit constantly. I know where you're coming from and there's no reasoning for anyone to act that way.   
Whatever happened to ""If you don't have anything nice to say then don't say it""?"
"Just a little rant defending Dimmu Borgir's music.","I really like Dimmu Borgir.  I like their old albums I like their new albums.

I hate when people say I wish a band would put out an album like their first one etc. If you like a bands older albums listen to them,  but if they keep putting out cds that are exactly the same I would get tired of the bands very quickly.  like it when a band tries new things and evolves.  "
"Just a little rant defending Dimmu Borgir's music.","THANK YOU for this!!! I don't think that they've gotten better over the years, but I can't think of a single album that I truly dislike by them. I loved Abrahadabra. And that's really controversial because black metal is my favorite style of music. So most of the people i talk to that are black metallers really give me a lot of shit every time i mention Dimmu. I know the metal parts of the new shit is very simple compared to the older days, but i dont have a problem with the symphonics taking the spotlight in some cases. "
"Just a little rant defending Dimmu Borgir's music.","Thank you. I hold the **extremely** unpopular opinion that Dimmu Borgir's music has gotten consistently better and better with each release, and I actually dislike the older, traditional ""this is how black metal is supposed to sound"" music. I don't understand that mentality at all. I think it's very closed minded. 

   I for one like progression and imagination. Generic tremolo licks atop unchanging blast beats with indecipherable vocals don't do it for me at all. A band sounding like an amazing dark orchestra does. My only argument is this: The newer Dimmu Borgir music that everyone hates... paints fucking PICTURES in my brain. I see landscapes. I envision scenes. It makes me perceive colors and shapes. You can't argue how it makes me feel with statistics and a perception of what you think *they* should be doing in *their* art. 

 It's just aesthetically pleasing to *me.* Period.
