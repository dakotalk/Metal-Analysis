"Gardenian - Heartless, In Flames - Evil in a Closet, Insomnium - While We Sleep...what melodic songs are like these?","There's just SO many songs out there I can't go through them all. But if you analyze the songs above they all have melodic tunes and melody with the guitars. Can you list more like these? Also, Iced Earth - Watching Over Me...emotional ones too
Thanks"

"Disarmonia Mundi - The Restless Memoirs EP","I'm excited to hear new stuff from them, but man is that mixing terrible."
"Disarmonia Mundi - The Restless Memoirs EP","OMFG they're back!!!

Dem goosebumps :3"
"Disarmonia Mundi - The Restless Memoirs EP","I can't view YouTube at work, but The Restless Memoirs EP was released back in 2009 with a reissue of their debut Nebularium.  Unfortunately, though it is a solid EP, it is not new music."
"Disarmonia Mundi - The Restless Memoirs EP","Well I read somewhere they're in the process of making new stuff, and I thought this was it, it's pretty damn good though!"

"So what do you guys think of Allegaeon's Elements of the Infinite?","I love it, personally. The thing I like the most about is the orchestral parts in 
songs like Threshold of Perception, Genocide for Praise- Vals for the Vitruvian Man, etc. 

What did you guys think of it though? "
"So what do you guys think of Allegaeon's Elements of the Infinite?","Overall I think that it's a solid album front to back. The more I listen to it the more I enjoy it, but there are a few things I thought the previous albums did better. While I appreciate Ezra experimenting with a lower register, I think that he sounded more clear and powerful in the higher range. This album, while more progressive, also seems to be lacking the catchiness of their prior works. After listening to Fragments or Formshatter, I'd find myself humming the tunes from the albums for the rest of the day, where as the only track with a similar effect on Elements is 1.618."
"So what do you guys think of Allegaeon's Elements of the Infinite?","Really? I think this album is super rhythmic and catchy. I especially like Our Cosmic Casket because of the rhythm and the lyrics and that ending is just so freaking brutal. Its awesome. 

I think for the most part Ezra stays in his higher range of vocals except for songs like Our Cosmic Casket. The thing i like most about Ezra though is the fact that he can sing lyrics that you wouldn't think would rhyme, but they do when he sings them.

Another thing I like about this album is its clear theme: space and science."
"So what do you guys think of Allegaeon's Elements of the Infinite?","It's interesting, we have vastly different takes on catchiness. I found Cosmic Casket to be the most forgettable track on the album. Everything is tuned so low that it kind of just blends together to me; where as songs like Dyson Sphere and Gravimetric Time Dilation have a nice blend and juxtaposition of highs and lows as well as some sick riffage. 

I do love all of Allegaeon's themes: from astronomy, to philosophy, quantum physics, to genealogy. They, along with their unique technical musicianship, are what really draws me to them.   "
"So what do you guys think of Allegaeon's Elements of the Infinite?","I think it's their best album so far. I love what they did with the orchestral tracks, and you just can't beat Biomech II."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","I actually really like electropop, i.e. t.A.T.u, Lights.  On a wider scale I am a fan of a lot of electronica, like Moby, Depeche Mode, and some other shoegaze bands like M83.

So, what else do you guys like to listen to?"
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Love MDM more than anything.

But I also love Techical/Progressive Death Metal, Folk Metal, (K)Pop, Hardstyle, (Hard) Dance, (Progressive) House, Blues and Classical."

Here's a badass [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLgxQbXzbco) that sounds like sonic the hedgehog.


It's also really melodic."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","I went through a phase where I listened to nothing but [Caravan Palace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7lxd7RL1To) for a few months"
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","I can dig it."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Power metal (really, any type of metal). Older pop (ABBA) and country. Classical. Some punk (Bad Religion, Rage Against). J-Pop, J-Rock. Trance and some types of electro. Videogame music, especially 8- and 16-bit tracks. Ambient."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Never heard of Rage Against.
Wait a sec... Lol"
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","For metal I'm a huge fan of death, grindcore, symphonic, doom, tech death, gothic, some groove, and a little prog.

In broader strokes, I'm a huge fan of jazz, orchestral and classical music, classic rock, instrumental rock, and blues."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Hardcore. Melodic Hardcore. Gabber. Minimal. Dad Rock."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","MDM has recently gotten me into medieval folk music. This album whole is catchy as fuck https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8d9sXioj4"
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","I love it!"
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","I'm guessing you listen to a lot of folk metal"
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Actually I've just begun listening to folk metal more actively.  My favorite so far is Eluveitie."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Instrumental indie music along with &lt;1950's jazz and blues. Then of course classic rock and other metal genres."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Generally i don't limit myself to any genre and i don't mind mainstream music. if the music is nice i will listen to it. But I mainly love MDM/Folk/Heavy metal and Trance

"
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Thrash is a second for me, after MDM. Then there's Industrial, Black, prog, tech-death and Doom."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Metal subgenres; melodic metalcore, some hardcore.

Otherwise; Orchestral, alternative, a capella, classic rock"
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Death metal is my main sub genre, then melodeath and sludge come after. Toss random artists from other genres into the mix and you've got an idea of what music I have on my phone."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","My closest favourite behind MDM is Technical Death Metal, or most Technical / Progressive forms of metal really. I'm not really a fan of the stereotypical 'djent' style of Progressive though, with a few exceptions like Animals as Leaders - while they were instrumental (hehe) in pioneering the sound they go above and beyond it too.

I really dig bands like Son of Aurelius, The Black Dahlia Murder, Inferi and Revocation. Some people name this Technical Melodic Death Metal but I think that's getting waaaay to specific. :)

Branching out more I've also been getting into Black Metal and it's related subgenres like Atmospheric Metal lately. If it's dark and brooding with pagan themes or influence, I'm down.

But going outside of metal, I love me some EDM. Savant, Koan Sound, glitchy stuff like that I like in particular. Don't tell anyone but Trap music just gets me for some reason. So fucking *turnt*

I'm also big on folk music, particularly Irish. I can play a tin whistle and a Bodhran."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Alternative Rock and Deathcore mainly:

Breaking Benjamin, Thousand Foot Krutch, Skillet, Suicide Silence and Whitechapel are a few bands from these two genres"
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Metal-core, jazz, classic and ballads"
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Prog, Doom/stoner, Technical Death, regular Death, classic, prog, and alternative rock and classical music."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Americana. I love old sounding bands like Old Crow Medicine Show, Punch Brothers, or Trampled by Turtles. There's something about pure acoustic music with a nice upbeat feel and a catchy melody to sing along with. It's happy music. "
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Technical Death Metal
Metalcore
Black Metal
Symphonic * Metal
Nu Metal"
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Progressive Death Metal and Power Metal are some of my other favorites."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Melodic death is my favorite subgenre of metal. But I'm a fan of other ones like folk metal, doom/cyber metal, prog metal, metalcore, and even nu metal.

In other genres outside metal, I'm a fan of some rap like Tech N9ne, Dark Lotus, and ICP. In addition, I seem to have a soft spot for some hard/alt rock."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","I really enjoy EDM like Knife Party, Zedd, and Krewella, and rap like Immortal Technique, and Childish Gambino."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Power Metal"
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Dammit, got here too late to be in on the action.

I've enjoyed death, progdeath, doom, power (more symphonic or atmospheric, usually), prog, thrash, post. Usually having some elements similar to the MDM stuff I like (atmosphere, melody, pacing, etc...)."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","basically everything."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Hardcore, melodic hardcore, metalcore, deathcore, grindcore, black metal (especially symphonic) and if we go further afield, I love rap, indie and neo-classical (fuck yeah Emilie Autumn)."
"What are r/melodicdeathmetal's favorite genres besides MDM?","Aside from Melodic Death Metal, I like Doom Metal, Black Metal, Atmospheric Black Metal, Technical Death Metal and Death Metal. Some Classical (mainly Archangelo Corelli) and Neoclassical (Emilie Autumn - Laced/Unlaced) is good, but in general, the further a genre strays from Metal, the less I like it. I absolutely cannot stand pop, electronic, rap, hip-hop, rock, etc. It makes my skin crawl."

Definitely a solid listen.

"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","/thread "
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","Bands evolve, nobody wants to hear the same record every time. Sure, if I could just get reroute to remain out of every album id be ok with that, but thats not creativity.

I personally enjoy the new song, and hope the rest of the album is better. It had a lot of the elementa youd expect from in flames musically, and with the wonderful hook for the chorus."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","bands do evolve, but unlike what soilwork does. In Flames just strips down all that's good in their sound and replaces it with angsty teen lyrics and mediocre riffs.

bands evolve is a valid argument for what in flames does, it doesn't change the fact that they're evolving into radio rock."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","I can agree with that, especially since soilwork is my favorite band."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","See there's a massive issue with this logic. Just because you stay in the same genre doesn't mean it sounds the same. That's why it's a genre. You wouldn't say Arch enemy sounds the same as at the gates which sounds the same as In Flames. They aren't even trying to be melodeath, or even anything that resembles a harder style of rock. They are literally going and doing exactly what the label wants them to do, and it sounds terrible."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","[deleted]"
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","No mate no. And honestly no offense but 50% of the fans out there (so hundreds of thousands) are saying the EXACT SAME THING as you, often with the same phrasing. 

Really, you're kind of creating a strawman argument. 

We don't want the same album done twice (I dont know why you mention Reroute as an album to get again as most early-In Flames fans see that as a shit album and the start of their downfall)  

We don't have a problem with evolution or progression. 

What we DO have a problem with is them watering down their music and writing, well...shit. 

Remember they pioneered a genre. Melodeath! This subreddit might not exist if it wasn't for In Flames and ATG &amp; DT (but I would argue mostly In Flames' influence). They brought true beauty into death metal with masterpieces like The Jester Race, Whoracle, Colony and Clayman!  And now they are turning their back on it completely and are becoming everything melodeath stood in opposition to. The bland, the generic, the uninspired, the non-refined, the simplistic, the immature. 

Honestly I would not care if In Flames became a folk band or jazz-fusion or country. As long as they did it with integrity and meaning. But instead they have compromised their own integrity releasing shit like this!"
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","He's saying if he could get that Reroute sound **out** of every album he'd be ok with that. 

Personally, I just wish Jesper would come back."

"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","[deleted]"
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","Amusingly, the track has done the opposite for me. This is about the 4th time I've heard it, and I find myself closing the link earlier and earlier every time. 

It's sad because In Flames and their album Jester Race is what got me into metal, but since Soundtrack to your Escape I haven't been able to find a single track to be excited about. Worse yet, after Sense of Purpose, I can't even find a single track that I can tolerate enough to finish. What I've heard from their upcoming album doesn't seem to buck that trend any for me either. I can respect that they keep trying something different and aren't afraid to change their sound, but in my opinion they've just gone in a direction that I no longer enjoy."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","[deleted]"
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","Nope, I agree with you completely on Insomnium. I love Since the Day -- and I even like their stuff after it! -- but I past that album, well, everything sounds identical. Also, the production/mixing is awful on their albums. While I didn't mind when I first got into them, now I just can't listen to their stuff most of the time. It's too brickwalled."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","Amusingly enough, I'm the same way, except for Come Clarity and after. Even though RTR and STYE are obviously inspired by ""alternative metal,"" I still find them catchy and fun. I found A Sense of Purpose intolerable to listen to, although Playground was a little better (I still haven't touched it in months)."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","I know a lot of people love Clayman, but to me, Clayman was the start of the downward trend towards mediocrity. Colony was fantastic."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","Clayman is hit or miss for me in retrospect. I love more than half of the tracks, but unlike their previous work there were a few that I occasionally found myself skipping. "
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (New Video)","Honestly Clayman is one of my favourite In Flames' albums. I can't pick between Jester Race, Whoracle, Colony or Clayman most the time but I do love Clayman because although it was HEADED towards the more mediocre direction, it didn't really show. Aside from Only For The Weak, the album was very much a solid and beautifully composed melodic death metal album that was an unrelentingly emotional journey. Satellites &amp; Astronauts transported me to a frame of mind where nothing matters- even your biggest mistake and regret and shame means nothing in the grand scheme of things; ""buy me a trip to the moon, so I can laugh at my mistakes, you see I can see earth from here and from this perspective it looks kind of silly"". But while that was relieving it also hammers in how insignificant you are which explains the very melancholic vibe of the piece.  
 Then the album rolls into what I believe is their most uplifting song of all time, Brush The Dust Away, which reminds you that you have a purpose, however minute, a purpose to progress and better yourself and unite with people to create a better tomorrow, in spite of the hiccups along the way and the fact that you doubt ""it will all be worth it"". And turn away from negativity and ""bad intentions"" and the somewhat apathy of humanity.  

I think those two songs alone made Clayman masterful. Not just lyrically but sonically. Reroute To Remain was the real start of the downfall. "

"Vesta- Soilwork",""
"Vesta- Soilwork","This is my favorite song on this amazing double album."
"Vesta- Soilwork","Same.

Any band that can be around that long with so many lineup changes and *still* put out their (arguably) best album to date...as a double album...seriously fucking impressive.  The entire album is a win.

These guys are **CRIMINALLY** underappreciated. "
"Vesta- Soilwork","Yep. Love that whole album and I'd say it's their best yet - which is saying something considering they don't have an album I don't love.

Got to see them live shortly after the album came out. It was one hell of a show. Caught one of Dirk's drumsticks."
"Vesta- Soilwork","Fuckin A man.  Yup been a fan from the start, and anyone that dismisses their new albums are just those basement dwelling old-school metal elitists.  Bjorn's vocals have only gotten better and better, as the flow of the instrumentals have as well.  It could be argued that some of the chops and solos have been degraded since the chainheart era, etc - but I honestly love their stylings on every single album, Peter Wichers or not.  

Bands need to start utilizing head voice and bluesy/manly singing.  It is insane how few bands utilize it (KSE, these guys, He is Legend, and I guess you could say In Flames) are really some of the only bands that come to mind.  It's sickening.  So many bands think that they need to sing like chicks to sound clean.  Bands like Periphery and BTBAM do it well without this type of singing, but still - it's shocking and sad how few bands use Bjorn's stylings."
"Vesta- Soilwork","What does it for me is the fact that they still have the same type of sound but it just gets immensely better with every album. 

I only wish In Flames had evolved like soilwork has, but they make the music they like, and so they should. Just my personal hopes and thoughts wish they were like their older stuff."
"Vesta- Soilwork","I'm of the opinion they have evolved, but I know not every In Flames fan shares that opinion. Mainly I like that over the recent albums there's more singing, and I find a lot of their newer metal uplifting/gets me pumped up/motivated (A Sense of Purpose). 

I started with Clayman / Reroute to Remain, and genuinely like their newer stuff better. It all boils down to what niches of metal do it for a person, the nuances keep changing as new albums come and go. "
"Vesta- Soilwork","I actually think that Anders has a really good singing voice, but his growls are part of what made In Flames awesome back in the day. "
"Vesta- Soilwork","What bands are you referring to actually have Speed-style clean (but powerful) vocals? I've been listening to Soilwork nonstop for ages now, and seriously wish the same thing, that more metal bands would try this. 

I keep seeing ""nobody listens to metal for the lyrics/vocals"" but Speed has absolutely spoiled me and ruined metal in a lot of ways for me. I practically demand vocals now as good as his, in addition to awesome metal. 

Anyway, the few other bands that come to mind for me, that have clean but manly singing (that are also my favorites) - Before the Dawn and Scar Symmetry / Solution 45. In Flames of course too. I'm guessing KSE = Killswitch Engage? Love his voice too, and fully agree. 

Growling mostly doesn't do anything for me anymore, thanks Speed. 

EDIT: Vesta seriously just popped up in my 37 favorite metal-workout songs playlist on shuffle, while browsing this thread, also I forgot to give a mention to Mercenary - adding to the clean/power vocals list."
"Vesta- Soilwork","I'd say check out He is Legend. Much different type of music perhaps - but has a great bluesy and manly rasp that I love so kinda like Jesse Leach a bit. Just as underutilized as headvoice IMO, except by a few southern metal bands which a lot of times are just really boring anyway, but HIL is one of my favs.  It Hates You was one of the best ""crossover"" metal albums ever recorded.  Incredibly underrated band. I WISH I knew of more bands that used headvoice like speed. I couldn't even think of any. Its a damn shame.  I'll have to check out the ones you recommended, although I already liked Scar Symmetry.  "
"Vesta- Soilwork","Holy crap, you'll probably love Before the Dawn, and thanks for the reply! I have to give HiL a try now, doing that atm. For a good starting BTD song, I recommend Deathstar Rising, their lead singer does a bit of (good) growling but there's a lot of good chorus clean singing in between. 

Thomas Saukkonen also looks exactly like fucking Kratos from God of War too, so there's that. "
"Vesta- Soilwork","Tuomas*"
"Vesta- Soilwork","I strongly agree with your second paragraph. "
"Vesta- Soilwork","Check out myGRAIN. Their vocalist sounds almost exactly like Speed"
"Vesta- Soilwork","Let the first wave rise is still on top for me..."
"Vesta- Soilwork","There's not a bad song on the album. But Vesta and Parasite Blues are my two favorite. Was glad when they opened with Parasite Blues when I saw them last year."
"Vesta- Soilwork","I deeply love soilwork. I've been to the last several concerts they've had in St. Louis and I've discovered Speed is a pretty cool guy. He posed for pictures and hung out with us after a show. Great guy. 

I started listening when Figure Number Five came out and have been well pleased ever since. It is rare for me to find a new band that I can enjoy as much as soilwork. I've really become a fan of both styles of vocals present, rather than just one or the other. Sometimes I find bands that had what I was looking for such as Into Eternity's two albums ""Buried in Oblivion"" and ""Dead or Dreaming"" but then lineup changes change the sound too much. 

Anyone else here know what I mean?"

"In Flames - Embody the invisible","I really like this album also, one of my favorite In Flames albums. But I usually count Clayman as the last incredible IF."
"In Flames - Embody the invisible","I don't know about Clayman. It's good, but it was definitely the start of their decline. There are lots of moments on that album that I just go ""What? Why?"", but Colony is awesome through and through. Also, Clayman was the first album that I really hated Anders' vocals."
"In Flames - Embody the invisible","I like Clayman, but I feel the same way. A lot of tracks that probably shouldn't be there. I honestly feel that Come Clarity is stronger than Clayman, but obviously weaker than everything else they did prior to that point.

I will stand out and say that Colony is my favorite In Flames album. I think it's better than TJR or Whoracle."
"In Flames - Embody the invisible","I've enjoyed most of their albums since personally."
"In Flames - Embody the invisible","I enjoy a lot of In Flames (including their latest album), but it's a different type of enjoyment. Old In Flames is more or less ""classic"" territory for me. If something off those albums comes on, I'll almost always listen to it. On the other hand, I have to be in the mood for anything else from them.

edit: I'll say this, though -- they're fucking awesome live. They haven't lost it at all there. "

* [Kuolemanlaakso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yruj9PQMLXU)  - Another one of Mikko Kotam√§ki's bands, but more doomish than BE and sung in Finnish.

* [Noumena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYSzIFPlShY)

There was even a guy front and center, who looked like an Indian greaser, he spent more time looking back at the crowd than at the band. Like he was afraid of being mugged or something. He left the floor during DT's set. "

"In Flames - ""Ropes""","I know Sounds of a Playground Fading isn't held in high regard by a lot of fans, but I loved it. Fantastic album. I appreciate that they did something new and it was catchy as hell. But I'm still not sold on the new direction they're going with their new material. Haven't really liked anything they've put out for it so far."
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","I agree wholeheartedly. I very much enjoyed their early stuff; Whoracle through Come Clarity got me interested. But I loved Ropes, Fear is the Weakness, and Darker Times from Sounds of a Playground Fading."
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","I'm a little biased because Sounds of a Playground is the first In Flames album I heard in full. I had heard a few songs from Whoracle and Come Clarity before, but never bought their albums or anything up until that point. So I love that whole album. But yes, objectively their earlier stuff is better. Still, I don't think the hate for Sounds is warranted."

"In Flames - ""Ropes""","what most people want is them to not change their sound, like metallica."
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","I don't think there's anything inherently bad with evolving the sound of a band, but the change in In Flames's sound is too drastic and in the wrong direction for many of their old fans."
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","And in the right direction for other fans. In reality it's all opinion and the circlejerk gets old."
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","This isn't a circlejerk, just people with opinions. Don't write anything with a different opinion off as just another circlejerk."
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","That opinion is spammed everywhere in flames comes up. Circlejerk can be defined by this situation."
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","Whatever you say, doesn't make it a less valid opinion though. I wouldn't have written anything in the first place if it weren't to explain what people really mean when they get mad at In Flames."
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","A circle jerk? You mean people who brought the bands popularity to where it is now, the people who backed them and made them famous. They have a right to complain. Without these fans this band would not be as huge as they are. That's why people get upset at this new bullshit sound. It's not an evolution, it's a completely different style. That'd be ok if they didn't try to act like they were going back to their roots, which was the claim with this new CD. Sound familiar? It's the same shit Metallica did with ""Death Magnetic"" and it was fucking horrendous. This band is doing everything Metallica did to become obsolete (except suing napster) and it's sad to see."
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","That's just like, your opinion man."
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","maybe its good that In flames have changed their sound. Metallica hasn't done anything remotely interesting in 20 years..."
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","I would kill for another album similar to the jesters race, its what got me into melodeath in the first place."
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","You'll never get another Jester's Race for a couple reasons. There is only one member in the band from that time so the creativity and skills are completely different. No one can write melody like Jesper, listen to their stuff post-Jesper it doesn't even have that same foundation that stretches from Lunar Strain to ASOP. They're also not 19 years old anymore they're in a completely different headspace than they were in 1996-97. And finally if they put out 10+ years of the the Jester's Race people would complain about that. Just look at Slayer vs Metallica. People say Metallica sucks cause they ""sold out"" and they say Slayer sucks cause they've been putting out Raining Blood for 25 years. "
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","Bjorn and Anders are still there from The Jester Race. However, it seems like Bjorn took melodic control starting with STYE. "
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","It's not hard to figure out what people want. They want new shit that uses the same formula as the old shit but doesn't sound the same. Metallica said they were ""returning to their roots"" with Death Magentic, and the only thing that was returned were copies of the CD. In Flames is claiming the same shit with this CD, and it's turning out just as bad. Nobody complains about older Melodeath bands that come out with new shit that keeps the formula (other than band members changing like Arch Enemy)."
"In Flames - ""Ropes""","I may like their early albums far more, these new albums are still great."

I guess this is extremely subjective but songs like Evil in the Closet by In Flames stand out so much more than other songs. Insomnium - While We Sleep, Kill Joy, Decoherence (instrumental). Eternal Sorrow - Frozen (acoustic), Phrophetian. Etc. etc. etc. SO MANY melodic death metal songs I can't even make it past 30 seconds cause it sucks."
"Shaded Enmity - And Life Was Great - Great song, any similar ones?","Give Wolfheart, Before the Dawn, really any of Tuomas Saukonnen's bands a try if you're into Insomnium. Here's one of my favorite songs off Winterborn:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtOZCdB18pM

"Ghost Brigade - IV ‚Äì One With The Storm Album Stream (2014) [Finland]",""
"Faithful Darkness - Pure Silence",""
"Nightrage: A New Disease is Born [full album]",""
"Nightrage: A New Disease is Born [full album]","Sound quality is pretty low. The album's very good though!"
"Nightrage: A New Disease is Born [full album]","That's what I get for not linking to the Spotify version.  Darn!"
"Whispered - Jikininki",""
"Whispered - Jikininki","I can't listen cause I'm at school, but what I've heard of Whispered (entire Shogunate Macabre album, just one run through) isn't really melodeath.

They're amazing, but just saying."
"Whispered - Jikininki","They're definitely melodeath. I don't know what else you'd think they are. A lot of folk influence but still undeniably melodeath. "
"Why is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?","Seriously this is one of the most talked about bands on /r/melodicdeathmetal and one of the most respected newer bands in the scene. You hear nothing but good things about them, almost everyone that listens to mdm knows about them and listens to them, and they consistently put out very good music that always has a unique sound yet is true to their original style.

How are they not playing all across the world? What can I do to bring them to the US? I already own all their albums, what else can I do to bring this amazing band into the global perspective?
"
"Why is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?","Apart from the fact that touring outside Australia for them would cost a ton of money, and that considering they are household in MDM circles but not worldwide (I mean, Insomnium haven't even headlined an NA tour yet, to my knowledge... last 2 have been behind Epica + Alestorm and then their upcoming one with Dark Tranquility).

As with many things in life, it's probably a money or logistics issue. That, and I would think most bands from Europe don't tour the entire world until after 3 to 4 albums."
"Why is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?","You forgot the part where a lot of European bands plan their tours around Festival Season in West/Northern Europe.  Since a ton of the bands we all like are EU citizens, cost to live and tour in Germany or Norway if you're a swede isn't nearly as much as it would be to tour North America for a month.  Niggas can just drive or take the ferry in between countries.  

A lot of European bands also write/record or tour America and other parts of the world during winter.  

As odd as it is, Festival season really is what a lot of bands seem to structure themselves around. Even American bands like Cannibal Corpse will be gone all summer in Europe from May-September.  


Don't know if this makes sense, but it's 1AM and I think I conveyed my points....I think.  

Money and that festival season mah niqqas.  No surprise that a band from the middle of fucknowhere in the metal scene sense at least can't get off the ground and get on a sustainable touring lifestyle.  Unless you're loaded with cash or have a job where you can just walk in and be like, ""Hey bOss, I'm taking 3 months off to tour Europe, okay?"", it's a bit hard for bands that didn't get big in the early 2000's to get off the ground.  

I forgot what band it was, might have been George Kollias or Derkek Roddy from Nile, but they said you should expect to go in debt at least $3,000 every month long tour you do, if you don't have all that months money paid off and your estimated tour cost of living x2.  

On the contrary, Johan Hegg of Amon Amarth literally used to sell cheese at a store in Sweden and has always been able to take time off to tour starting in the late 90's.  True shit.  "
"Why is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?","Being from NA, I wouldn't say ""Forgot"" more then ""Not aware of"". I'm no ""melodeath touring expert"". Just providing what I knew. I know Insomnium in an interview spoke of bringing Be'Lakor over to Europe for a tour together, but when they sat down and tried to figure out the logistics and financial side of things, it just didn't make sense to do so. That was mainly what I was going off on.

You do bring up good points though."
"Why is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?","As an avid MDM fan I've never heard of them, what track can you recommend?"
"Why is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?","If I were to say which one on each album that hooked me in...

Neither Shape Nor Shadow

From Scythe to Sceptre

Abeyance"
"Why is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?","Literally any of their music. All of their songs are phenomenal. Wintersun and Be'lakor are the only two bands who I believe are flawless. Not a single song I dislike by both bands.

Anyway, I'd recommend giving Abeyance and Venator a listen. Both are great.

"Why is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?","Remnants

The Dream and the Waking

A Natural Apostasy"
"Why is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?","I believe they are touring Europe in 2015. Also, I believe they got real demanding jobs and the band is just a hobby/part-time thing i think. "
"Why is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?","Be'lakor have toured outside of Australia, I saw them at Summer Breeze festival in Germany a couple of years ago. "
"Why is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?","2010 or 2012?  I was there for 2010.  My first OA festival and first time outside the states.  It was glorious.  I wish I had seen them back then."
"Why is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?","Not sure, I've been there 2010/2011/2012/2014 I guess it was 2012 when they were there. I didn't think much of them at the time and we left after the first song or two. Wish I'd stayed."
"Why is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?","I've seen 3 bands from australia i had never heard of supporting bands in the uk. I reckon it's just about getting a band willing to take them on tour."

"Dark Tranquillity - Archetype","I love DT, but this song really sucks."
"Dark Tranquillity - Archetype","What the hell did I just hear?"
"Dark Tranquillity - Archetype","Why the hell is this upvoted? Are people just seeing ""Dark Tranquillity"" and upvoting without listening or knowing the song? 

Dark Tranquillity may have made this song as a joke, but it's not MDM, and it's not good. So why is it at the top of this sub?"

Though to be fair a lot of the bands aren't strictly ""melodic death metal"" but have melodeath elements so the genres shouldn't really make much of a difference :P

"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview",""
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","I hope we can at least get this on Spotify or something. That would be enough for me.

I'm also reminded of how grateful I am that, while In Flames is doing worse lately, Soilwork is at least better than ever."
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","I know, Resisting the Current (third track on the preview) sounds absolutely mega! Stabbing the Drama was my gateway album, but bar STAGD, they've just been getting better and better since."
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","I somewhat agree. Great Divide wasn't that great (that guitar tone was atrocious) but I would say that Stabbing the Drama and before are better. I love all of their shit though. "
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","The only album pre-Stabbing that I really love is A Predator's Portrait. That being said, I'm a much bigger fan of the modern stuff compared to the older stuff. 

If I were to rank Soilwork's albums, it'd be Infinite, Panic, Predator, Stabbing, Chaos, Chainheart, Figure, Steelbath, Great Divide. The top 4 are very closely matched though, in my opinion"
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","That's a fairly good list, and I guess we can all agree that Great Divide was rather mediocre. It's kind of sad to think that it came out the year after In Flames released Come Clarity, which was at least a good album.

If I had to rate them from best to worst, I'd go with Infinite, Predator, Figure, Stabbing, Chaos, Chainheart, Panic, Steelbath, and Great Divide. I like all of them quite a bit except for Great Divide, so ordering them is kind of hard.

Strange thing for me is I loved Panic Broadcast the year it was out. The very moment it was out, I listened to it like crazy, but a few years later, I find it kind of difficult to go back to it."
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","I have similar feelings toward The Panic Broadcast...it just hasn't held up like other Soilwork albums.  It is tough for me to rank the Soilwork albums, as they have changed quite a bit in their career.  If I had to, I'd probably go Chaos, Predator, Infinite, Stabbing, Figure, Panic, Chainheart, Steelbath, Sworn.  Really, outside of the bottom 4, the rest are nearly interchangeable.  The only reason I have Steelbath and Chainheart so low is I consider Speed's clean vocals to be an integral part of the Soilwork sound.  Without them, Soilwork sounded like a generic (albeit talented) At the Gates clone."
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","Speed's cleans are unbelievable. I saw him live last year when Soilwork played in my home town and he can really just turn it on a switch.

I've still got a video of Tongue on my phone. If I wasn't right there in the mosh, I wouldn't have believed how mental it was"
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","Where and when did you see them? :)"
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","About this time last year when they did their Australian tour. It was just a mental, mental night! I got fist-bumps from all of the band members! :D"
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","Sweet! I was their guitar tech for some time last year but that was during the European part of the tour (which was after the Australian, I think?), so I was hoping you'd say one of those cities haha!

I totally agree about his vocals, incredibly good every single show."
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","Sweet! That's bloody awesome! Sylvain and David work so well on the guitars together too, I've got some great pictures of them soloing together right in front of me

Just the energy and the power they had, made even the small venue they played at feel like a stadium"
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","See, I still think the Panic Broadcast holds up great! I don't quite understand, especially around this sub, the stigma attached to it. I thought the album was extremely well constructed, and every song has held it's own. The only song that has fallen away for me is Enter Dog of Pavlov.

"
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","I guess part of my issue is that they were *so close* to making one of their best albums, but fell a bit short.  There are some catchy riffs and catchy choruses that implant themselves in my brain for days, but I haven't found myself coming back to them as frequently as other Soilwork albums."
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","Man these guys never stop!"
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","Sounds great!"
"Soilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview","That last song is fucking wicked. The rest, sounds like it deserves to have a word in the name of the EP that's the same as their previous full album but it doesn't have the same drive and intensity imo."

"THE AGONIST - Panophobia [4:09]","The songs are awesome.

As for Vicky's voice.. I still can't figure out if I'm just not used to it yet or if her clean vocals are actually kinda ""weak"". Either way, something about them does not feel quite right. Maybe it just takes more time to get used to her singing.

"Tip of my tongue: I think it's a Disarmonia Mundi song","EDIT: it was Morphogenesis By Scar Symmetry. I can relax finally.

The chorus is really clean vocals and it sounds like the lyrics are something like, ""we are done with world news mechan-i-kum, no longer suffer iradium.""

All the syllables in ""mechanikum"" and ""iradium"" are on the offbeat (syncopated)

God it's been stuck in my head all day and it's driving me nuts!!!!!!!!!

Then, in I think the post-chorus, after it goes like, ""something something little darling..."" or something like that

I know that that's complete and utter gibberish, but it's super clean lyrics and I think it a DM song.

If anyone can solve this I will be forever indebted."

A quick'n'dirty translation, with poetic license:

""Spontaneously Dead""
------------------

Digging a grave for myself

I have until tomorrow

The final nail in the coffin

Death is the reward for evil deeds

----

Yesterday's happiness is today's anxiety

Bright dawn gets shrouded in mist

I guess good will win over evil eventually

Although one can only assume

----

Grieving doesn't end no matter how I cry

Scars draw a black scenery

Time has come, I must admit

Love long dead won't help me through the days

----

The final nail on the coffin lid white

Lowered below the ground

Thus dies the love of this life

Emanating deep sorrow

----

Grieving doesn't end even when I spit blood

Scars finished the scenery

----

Spontaneously dead, lonely

The last step on a burnt ground

Dead is love, words spoken into underworld

Trails decayed into earth "

"A collection of lesser known melo-death","Hey guys

I started thinking back to my youth and started recalling a bunch of bands I encountered at the time. So I decided to share a couple that I guess a majority of you haven't really heard before. Some of them should be fairly unknown while some a bit more known (Absence, Satariel)

Funnily enough most of these bands were actually ""local bands"" that I saw live at some point

Gothenburg had(I don't know the current sitation) a massive melo-death scene with tons of bands popping up with potential. A funny tidbit unless my memory is completely wrong. The only band that truly made it big from back then was Sonic Syndicate, however SS was nowhere near the top in the scene, they were constantly behind bands such as Avatar, Engel, Somber etc. Then they switched their style into a more mainstream approach and got their break

FYI: It's possible that i've completely missed something and maybe some band is bigger than I thought, don't shoot me

"7 string melodic death bands","Ensiferum isn't in any way black metal."

"7 string melodic death bands","Goblin Dance and Old Man both have very prominent black metal riffs in them. There are a few other riffs strewn throughout the album. Also, the harsh vocals on the album are way closer in range and style to black metal than death metal. I'm not saying they are black metal, but they are certainly influenced by black metal."
"7 string melodic death bands","Yeah but they actually don't sing much about vikings during that time period, and yeah jari's vocals are definitely blackened. Most of ensiferums music is about finnish folklore not nordic so really they are finnish folk metal."

Wow, just listened to those, and they're bloody brilliant!  Thanks for the recommendation :)"
"[META] Maybe we should have an essential albums list in the sidebar?","So sad the Insomnium album isn't ""Above a Weeping World"". (It. along with the ""Shadows"" album by OG (New World ...) and Insomnium (... of the Dying Sun) make my personal top 3, in that order. Since the Day in incredible, though.

So, so sad."
"[META] Maybe we should have an essential albums list in the sidebar?","The problem with Insomnium is that I can never choose a fav album, they're all equally amazing. So really any album of theirs on the list is enough."
"[META] Maybe we should have an essential albums list in the sidebar?","Whoa there, let's not call it a problem, let's call it ""The beauty with Insomnium"" :P

I get what you mean though. I have an emotional attachment to AaWW (Last Statement, in particular) along with it just being so great. Shadows is recent, but I'm a huge Vanhala fan, and I love the overall message behind it so it should stick to 2nd. But I always seem to change the order in my mind of which one comes after all of that.

That said, if AaWW is a 11/10 for me and Shadows is a 10/10, AtD and Since the Day are both 9.5/10 (recently changed my mind on AtD), and In The Halls... and OfS are both around 8.5 (just not nearly as consistent as everything else... that said, great albums)."

"[META] Maybe we should have an essential albums list in the sidebar?","I like this idea.  So many people jump onto this subreddit to ask for recommendations.  An essential albums list in the sidebar would be a great resource for those new to melodeath.  Unfortunately, I foresee some potential arguments.

I suggest laying down some ground-rules, like 20 albums total and only one album per band, for example.

Aside from those mentioned by /u/SilpheedX3, I feel that Soilwork should be on the list with either Natural Born Chaos or A Predator's Portrait.  Other bands like Arch Enemy (Wages of Sin, maybe) and Scar Symmetry (Holographic Universe) have released some must-hear albums."
"[META] Maybe we should have an essential albums list in the sidebar?","That sounds like a good idea, I'd say ten albums (don't want to overwhelm newcomers) and only one album per band so there's enough variance.

"[META] Maybe we should have an essential albums list in the sidebar?","I'd say a list with a max of 2~3 per band isn't a bad idea, because sometimes people prefer one album over the other, and yet both are in the same realm of greatness.

I see a lot of people have very high scores for ""Across the Dark"" and ""Since the Day it All Came Down"" (for Insomnium), ""The Gallery"" and ""Damage Done"" (DT), for example."

"Good ""early gothenburg"" style metal bands from the 2000s?","Not a recent band, but if you're looking for that kind of sound, you should definitely listen to Sacrilege (the band that Daniel Dinsdale played in before In Flames). 

Off the top of my head, I'd also recommend 'A bloodred path' by Gates of Ishtar, and 'Source' and 'The dying wonders of the world' by The Duskfall. I'm probably forgetting a lot, but my CDs are all packed away because new house and no shelves yet, so I can't look through them."

"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Persefone was ""a lot earlier"" in your melodeath career?  Now I feel old.  Early in my melodeath career was more than a decade ago."
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Well, technically, mine was 3 years ago. Persefone should not fall under that umbrella, though. I was just spitting out albums I liked a lot before, then made it into a list of general ""just couldn't find a spot list"" (Persefone, Lunarsea). Didn't revise what I had written before that, then boom.

What I guess I meant (for the rest other then the 2 mentioned above) were that my taste has changed a lot compared to last year in terms of melodeath, and those albums - which were once held in high regard - aren't really what tickles my fancy anymore."
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Nice list, glad to see Lunarsea on it. They are highly underrated. "

And since I started listening to melodeath around 2010, this would be fair :P It was more to say that I had my ""CoB, Kalmah, Amon Amarth, Wintersun"" phase. Then I forgot I had started out that list with that sentence and just added other albums I had particularly liked for a long period of time, but no longer did it as much for me (except for PErsefone and Lunarsea - if I had 2 more spots on the list they would be the two I put in there)."

Though I really hate the metal genre war, I can't really justify adding Skyforger or The Cold White Light to a melodeath list.

I know there are a few very popular melodeath bands missing from my list (e.g. Insomnium, Amon Amarth, Wintersun, Norther, Omnium Gatherum, etc.).  For some reason, these bands haven't ""hooked"" me like some of their melodeath brethren.  Maybe I just need some more exposure."

"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Probably Pitch Black Progress, it's the most ""traditional"" melodeath of their albums.  Since your list is (nearly) void of clean vocals, I'll warn you that Scar Symmetry relies fairly heavily on clean choruses.  Fortunately, Christian's growl is pretty brutal, which keeps a heavier edge to the music."
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","I agree with what /u/MadStorkMSU said, ""Pitch Black Progress"" (the song) and ""The Kaleidoscopic God"" from the album are both good starts if you aren't into clean vocals as much. Also ""The Illusionist"" was the single from the album and does a pretty good job of pulling people into it from my experience. "
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","I just listened to skyforger (amorphis) for the first time and its excellent. Its weird i don't usually like whole power metal vocal style all that much but the guitar work, keyboards and grand piano melodies win me over. Thanks! "
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Arch Enemy - Rise of the Tyrant

Arch Enemy - Khaos Legions

Arch Enemy - Anthems of Rebellion

Children of Bodom - Hatebreeder

Children of Bodom - Hate Crew Deathroll

In Flames - Clayman

No particular order, I'm aware that there are people who think COB, Chthonic and Amon Amarth are not really melodeath, and they might be right, but what I love about the other bands is what I love about them as well, so for me they are at least melodeath enough to be on this list.

Cheers"
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Who cares what people think, Hatebreeder, Hatecrew Death Roll and Surtur Rising are all very well melodic death metal albums.

EDIT: Holy shit just checked out Chthonic for the first time, so goddamn heavy.  "
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Fuck yes. I've been in to melodeath for so long now I've heard most bands that are at least moderately known so finding something like this is always a treat!"
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","This x 1000... So hard to find something refreshing in this genre. Put me down for also discovering Chthonic today. Damn, these guys are awesome!"
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Really kicked the game up a notch for me when I discovered them last year. They're great live as well, I saw them play on the 25th of December in front of maybe 20 people last year. They enjoyed the show, were thankful for the people that showed up and stayed around for a chat and pictures afterwards. Really nice folks, all of them."
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","I got to see them on Ozzfest of all places one year. They are pretty fantastic live."
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Looks like we agree that roughly half the list should be Arch Enemy, In Flames, and Soilwork, though we seem to disagree on the albums.  I'm surprised to see The Living Infinite as the only Soilwork album.  Obviously, music is a matter of taste, but I feel that both A Predator's Portrait and Natural Born Chaos are superior albums to The Living Infinite.  I guess that could change the more I listen to TLI."
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Wall of text coming in, sorry.

Well, I do like Predator's Portrait and Natural Born Chaos. But they don't go on my list. The main reason for this is that none of them surprised me as much as TLI.

So:

Last year I was at a point where I thought that I've seen or rather heard it all melodeath-wise. I thought that nothing really new could arise from that since it had been a very long time since I discovered a band or found a new album that I really, really liked. I hadn't really listened to Soilwork for a long time, most of my melodeath routine consisted of In Flames and Arch Enemy, and I didn't expect much from Soilwork since, while they had a couple of good songs, I never ranked them that high in my favorite melodeath bands.

Then TLI came out and I sort of found out about it by accident and gave it a listen - and kept listening to it for the next 3 months straight. I was just surprised at the overall quality and songwriting, especially since it has 20 freaking songs on it. Sure it's a fair bit more mainstream since most of the stuff but to be honest fuck that. It's fast, got great melodies and I think the overall sound and production are amazing. I also saw Soilwork for the second time live last year(first time being at Wacken 2006 where they SUCKED(honestly it was really bad...)) and they rocked, so that's why that album is on that list."
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","That's certainly a fair assessment and I truly enjoy discussions like this.

I am probably a bit biased, as Soilwork was my main gateway into melodeath.  Natural Born Chaos was the first melodeath album I purchased, and I was hooked.  Soon after NBC came Reroute to Remain (In Flames) and Figure Number Five (Soilwork).  These albums hold a special place in my musical heart.  Everything about them ""surprised me"" (to use your words).  I certainly liked The Living Infinite enough to put it in my top 20 list, but NBC and APP are both in my top 5.  I think that if, say, Dark Tranquillity or In Flames were my main gateway to melodeath, I might feel the same way you do about Soilwork's discography."
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","I'm with you in that Soilwork was the first band to really get me into melodeath and with Natural Born Chaos, too. Fantastic album. But TLI is absolutely Soilwork's best work yet. Still, I don't think they have an album I don't like."
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Yeah I guess that was also a bit part of the problem. For example I used to LOVE In Flames and Children of Bodom, but their recent albums have left me utterly disappointed, so I guess that contributed to the fact that I was very positively surprised.

But yeah, I totally get your point and I haven't in fact listened to the older Soilwork material properly(except for Predator's Portrait, which I own). So I think I'll do just that, maybe I'm in for a surprise or two there as well."
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","I never got into COB much, though I love Follow the Reaper.

I have been a big In Flames fan for a while now.  I agree that the last few In Flames albums have been disappointing, though (in my opinion) Sounds of a Playground Fading was a marked improvement over A Sense of Purpose.

As far as Soilwork is concerned, The Living Infinite was a huge return to form after a decade of *relative* mediocrity.  The Panic Broadcast had some great moments, but never really put it all together.  Sworn to a Great Divide is easily the worst album in their catalog.  Stabbing the Drama is (was?) their best post-Natural Born Chaos album, as it was a great mix of melody and aggression.  It still had a few stinkers, though (e.g. Fate in Motion and If Possible), and relied heavily on the metalcore movement (which is a bit strange, as Soilwork is an obvious influence on many metalcore bands, not the other way around).  Figure Number Five felt like an experimental album.  There were a ton of keyboard atmospheres thrown in, which didn't quite work.  I still love the album, thoguh, and it has some of Soilwork's catchiest choruses (e.g. Distortion Sleep).  In all, Soilwork has has some amazingly strong songs in the years since Natural Born Chaos, but never really put it all together and released another amazing album until The Living Infinite."
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Sums it up beautifully. Regarding In Flames, I miss the heaviness of the old albums, especially in Anders' voice. While it probably was the best for him, Jesper Str√∂mblad leaving did not really help the songwriting. I thought Bj√∂rn could pull it off, but there's just been something missing ever since."
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","It was off-putting to listen to the last album and keep thinking ""Damn, imagine if this was Anders 5 to 10 years ago performing"".

I personally never got into Soilwork. Mr. Strid just doesn't do it for me. Only album that held my attention (for a short while) was ""Chainheart Machine"""
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Ok, here goes in no particular order:

Kalmah - Swampsong

Kalmah - The Black Waltz

Kalmah - For the Revolution

Amon Amarth - The Crusher

Amon Amarth - Versus the World

Dark Tranquillity - Projector

Dark Tranquillity - Character

Dark Tranquillity - We are the Void

Wintersun - Wintersun

Wintersun - Time 1 (and probably 2 when it is finally released)

The Absence - Riders of the Plague

The Absence - Enemy Unbound

In Flames - The Jester Race

In Flames - Whoracle

Children of Bodom - Hatebreeder

Be'lakor - Stone's Reach

Soilwork - The Living Infinite

Amorphis - Skyforger

Disarmonia Mundi - Mind Tricks

Eternal Tears of Sorrow - A Virgin and a Whore

One album that might be debatable as melodeath that I really love is Death's Symbolic. I think it is far enough away from traditional death metal because of its abundance of melodies in the guitar work. "
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","I would definitely put Death's ""A Sound of Perseverance"" in my top 10 albums in general, but doesn't fit in this thread. Symbolic is great too, but I prefer the progressive edge on ""SoP""."
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Yeah, that is definitely one of my favorite Death albums along with Symbolic and Leprosy. "
"My top 20 favorite melodeath albums, whats yours?","Thought this would be pretty easy, man was I wrong! I know it's way more than 20.. just want to get the word out on some of these great albums!! Thanks to everyone else who contributed a list, already discovered a few new bands!

"Great French Melodeath (Designed &amp; Supported by Niklas Sundin)","Thanks for sharing! I really like (note: LOVE) melodeath but hearing the same types of vocals for the majority of bands in the genre gets a little boring, so its nice when a band can do what they do really well without having a singer doing vocals. Sometimes the music is enough to get the point of the song across. 

One thing though: how can this be a one man band? Does he just like edit all the instrumental parts in or is he like a mutant with 8 arms? Either way this is awesome."
"Great French Melodeath (Designed &amp; Supported by Niklas Sundin)","There is a lot of one man, or even 2 men, band out there,  (e.g. Summoning or Caladan Brood)

When a band record a LP/EP anyway, they all play one after another, usually starting with drums. A one man band don't do differently, but instead of rehearsing with multiple people and every instrument being played by someone different, he play them all (or program some in a music software)"

Earlier OG have a very high pitch growler, so if you like the harsh growls you might not enjoy it that much. However, musically, Spirit and August Lights (or whatever it is) is very good. I just can't stand the old vocalist they had."

"Prog Melodeath bands similar to Fractal Gates, In Mourning, Syndemic?","In Vain's Aenigma

Opeth's ""My Arms, Your Hearse"" I personally consider as a melodeath-like prog album...

Apart from that, /u/inugami47 basically emptied my list. I might've had more if I was discovering new things instead of being completly hooked to Woods of Ypres' Woods 5 : Grey Skies and Electric Light. I've listened to literally nothing but that for nearly 2 weeks now."

"Recommend me a band","Dark Tranquillity should be up your alley. They have a long running history much like In Flames. Depends if you are more into early In Flames or their later stuff, if you like their earlier stuff then check out: Projector, The Mind's I, or The Gallery.

Their later stuff is a lot more melodic and incorporates more synth-heavy melodies. If that is what you are into (which I am), start with: Damage Done, Character, or Fiction.

If you want a mix of clean and harsh vox check out Scar Symmetry. Also if you are wanting female vox check out Arch Enemy (""Wages of Sin"" and up).

- Insomnium - Decoherence
- Insomnium - The Gale
- In Flames - The Jester's Dance
- In Flames - Varmlandsvisan

I've listened to more instrumentals but these are the ones I can think of any more off the top of my head. There's a couple more In Flames songs.

What are your favourites? "

[Beyond The Horizon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7AREHfoVRk)

[Omnium Gatherum - Luoto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkrQsaaEZcI)

[Lunarsea - Phostumous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6MEWdJC4jc) - The opening track sets up the album in a way similar to Insomnium's ""The Gale""

[Persefone - Conciousness (Parts 1 and 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_LtFlqBtuU) - Among many instrumental parts on this album

[At The Gates - In The Flames Of The End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjWOjtgMimc) There's another good one on that album, but can't remember which one of the many tracks it is XD

Guy in the comments mentioned Ghost Brigade's ""22:22 Nihil"" which is also very nice. If you're a fan, you can look up for [The Ocean - Pelagial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx7u6ZSxeI8). I linked the instrumental version of the album, but there is also a version with all the lyrics.

All the In Flames tracks mentioned in the comments are great (I'm partial to [Dialogue With The Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po1_lRHCeTU) myself

[Kalter - Reflexions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxppjKZ_i6g) is pretty good too.

And while not quite melodeath, I've always liked [Death's - Voice Of The Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOsIXpDH_R0). Chilling.

"Darkest Hour - The Patriot Virus [2003]. Listen to that opening riff.","I really love this band. The first time I heard about them was when I saw them live at Mayhem. I had an immediate affinity with them. Honestly though, this isn't their best rhythm work in my opinion. I think an even better riff would either be the intro part of ""No God"" or ""Sound the Surrender"" Also, isn't Darkest Hour metalcore? I love metalcore but I don't think they classify as death metal. Maybe melodic metalcore though. "
"Darkest Hour - The Patriot Virus [2003]. Listen to that opening riff.","definitely not metalcore. a lot of their contemporaries belonged in the melodic metalcore classification, but DH was always more straightforward melodic death like classic At the Gates, In Flames, and Soilwork. And no breakdowns. "
"Darkest Hour - The Patriot Virus [2003]. Listen to that opening riff.","Exactly what I was going to say. THe main thing to me was no breakdowns and always bitching riffs."
"Darkest Hour - The Patriot Virus [2003]. Listen to that opening riff.","Maybe their earlier stuff has some hardcore in it, but I think they migrated over to straight up melodic death right around this album. Undoing Ruin is basically a melodic death metal album, and everything they've done since then I would say is melodic death.

The birds and nature imagery were more than adequate."

"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","I've been really getting into melodic death metal within the past 2 years and I want to expand my library a bit. The Death Metal that I currently I listen to Amon Amarth, Tyr, Arch enemy (older stuff, not too into Alissa White-Gluz's vocals) and Heaven Shall Burn along with some random songs here and there that friends send me.

Anyone got any good recommendations? It will be very much appreciated.

edit: Thanks for all the recommendations you guys! I really appreciate it, upvotes for all! :D"
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","**At the Gates**: I'd recommend Slaughter of the Soul and their new album, At War With Reality. ATG is also one of the pioneering Melodic Death Metal bands.

**Be'lakor**: I'd recommend all 3 albums; The Frail Tide, Stone's Reach, and Of Breath and Bone.

**Before the Dawn**: I'd recommend their [entire discography](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Before_the_Dawn/8508). Really solid, standard Melodic Death Metal. While they disbanded, Tuomas Saukkonen started a new band, Wolfheart, that preserved a lot of how Before the Dawn sounds.

**Blackguard**: I'd recommend both of their albums, Profugus Mortis and Firefight. They're a pretty fun Melodic Death/Folk Metal band.

**Blood Stain Child**: An interesting band that somehow fuses Melodic Death Metal and Trance of all things. I've only really given their album [Epsilon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vobp17bP17c) a listen, but it's really fucking good stuff.

**Carcass**: I'd recommend Heartwork and their newest release, Surgical Steel.

**Children of Bodom**: I haven't given them an extensive listen, but I know Children of Bodom is all sorts of fun Melodic Death/Power Metal.

**Dark Tranquillity**: One of the pioneering Melodic Death Metal bands. I'd recommend Haven, Damage Done, Character, Fiction, We Are the Void, and Construct. Mikael Stann

**Disarmonia Mundi**: I'd recommend Fragments of D-Generation, Mind Tricks (+re-release), The Isolation Game, and The Restless Memoirs (EP). Soilwork's Bjorn Strid did a ton of vocals for this band.

**Eternal Tears of Sorrow**: I've only listened to their album, Saivon Lapsi, but their entire discography seems good to me.

**The Few Against Many**: Their sole album, SOT, is incredible, especially because they have Christian Alvestam on vocals.

**Hypocrisy**: I'd recommend Abducted, The Final Chapter, Hypocrisy, Into the Abyss, Catch 22, The Arrival, Virus, A Taste of Extreme Divinity, and End of Disclosure. Hypocrisy is one of my absolute favorite bands that definitely emphasizes the Death Metal part of Melodic Death Metal, as well as Peter Tagtgren's vocals being fucking awesome.

**In Flames**: One of the pioneering Melodic Death Metal bands. I'd recommend The Jester Race, Black-Ash Inheritance, Whoracle, Colony, Clayman, Reroute to Remain, Soundtrack to Your Escape, and Come Clarity. In Flames was one of the bands that got me into Melodic Death Metal.

**Insomnium**: The fan favorite of this subreddit, and one of the best Melodic Death Metal bands currently. I'd recommend [their entire discography.](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Insomnium/2332)

**Kalmah**: I'd recommend [their entire discography.](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Kalmah/702)

**KaÃàlter**: I'd recommend both albums, Spiritual Angel and Ubuntu.

**Mercenary**: I'd recommend 11 Dreams, The Hours That Remain, Architect of Lies, and Metamorphosis. 

**Mnemic**: I've only listened to Sons of the System, but Mnemic overall seems good.

**Mors Principium Est**: I'd recommend Inhumanity, The Unborn, Liberation = Termination, and ...And Death Said Live.

**Omnium Gatherum**: I'd recommend The Redshift, New World Shadows, and Beyond. 

**Parasite Inc.**: I'd recommend their sole album, Time Tears Down.

**Raintime**: I'd recommend Tales From Sadness, Flies &amp; Lies, and Psychromatic.

**Satariel**: I'd recommend Hydra, and White Ink: Chapter One.

**Scar Symmetry**: I'd recommend Symmetric in Design, Pitch Black Progress, Holographic Universe, Dark Matter Dimensions, The Unseen Empire, and The Singularity (Phase I - Neohumanity). After Holographic Universe, they parted ways with Christian Alvestam, and picked up Lars Palmqvist and Roberth Karlsson (note: TWO VOCALISTS) to replace him. Scar Symmetry was one of the bands that got me into Melodic Death Metal.

**Shade Empire**: While Shade Empire is a mixture of a lot of genres, I'd highly recommend Omega Arcane.

**Skyfire**: I'd recommend their entire discography. I haven't given Skyfire an extensive listen, but it's good.

**Soilwork**:  I'd recommend A Predator's Portrait, Natural Born Chaos, Figure Number Five, Stabbing the Drama, Sworn to a Great Divide, The Panic Broadcast, and The Living Infinite. Soilwork is one of the bands that got me into Melodic Death Metal, and Bjorn Strid's vocals are amazing.

**Solution .45**: I'd recommend their sole album, For Aeons Past. Christian Alvestam is the vocalist. I don't have to say anymore, really.

**Sonic Syndicate**: I'd recommend Eden Fire, Only Inhuman, and Love and Other Disasters. 

**Starkill**: I'd recommend Virus of the Mind, I haven't listened to much else, but it's good.

**The Stranded**: I'd recommend their sole album, Survivalism Boulevard. Both members of Disarmonia Mundi are in this band.

**Swallow the Sun**: I'd recommend their entire discography.

**This Cold Life**: I'd recommend Ascent of the Fallen, and Fallacy.

**Torchbearer**: I'd recommend Death Meditations, as I haven't listened to much else. Contains Christian Alvestam and Satariel vocalist, Par Johansson.

**Universum**: I'd recommend Leto Destinatus, and Mortuus Machina. Christian Alvestam does guest vocals on a few tracks on Mortuus Machina. Surely you see a trend by now.

**Wintersun**: I'd recommend Wintersun, and Time I.

EDIT: I might get around to adding links, we'll see."
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Well, that's definitely the essentials. Listening to The Gallery (Dark Tranquility), The Jester Race (In Flames) and Slaughter of the Soul (At the Gates) is definitely a ""must"" since those 3 albums are some of the most influential.

Oh and for Children of Bodom, pick and choose amongst their most popular songs from Hatebreeder and Follow the Reaper. They're my favorite band, but only some of their songs really appeal to melodeath fans"
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","You are my metal twin."
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Awesome list! I listen to about half of these currently. Thanks for the recommendations."
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","The only must try-out on this list that isn't there is Words of Farewell. Hell of a list."
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Words of Farewell is really fucking awesome, thanks for the suggestion."
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Insomnium is my favorite. Closely followed by Omnium Gatherum (they now share a guitarist because the one from Insomnium needed to focus on being a doctor?). Fractal Gates. Before the Dawn. Wolfheart. If you like Heaven Shall Burn you'll probably like Caliban and Bleed the Sky even though I don't think any of them are MDM. Also Mnemic. Be'lakor  (spelling?) - some of their stuff is a little weird to me but in the same song it can do a 180 and be completely awesome. Thinking of track 1 on album ""of breath and bone"". Scar Symmetry (apparently have a brand new album out and I was unaware). Solution .45. Kalmah are good like someone else said already (little too folky for me but still good). Hypocrisy is ok but has a really really good song here and there (Erased, Fire in the Sky, maybe one or two more are my absolute favorites). Soilwork - actually eased me into MDM from American nu metal, post hardcore and metal core with album ""figure number five"" everything before that is more thrash and most stuff after is more melodic.

Trying to think here.

Maybe: Mors Principium Est?

Hope that has helped. I like a lot of music, MDM is my favorite though.

Edit: can't believe I forgot Dark Tranquility! They aren't in any current play lists but the first time I heard ""ThereIn"" it blew my mind.

I would say At The Gates, Caracas or In Flames but I think MDM has completely changed since they started it. In Flames is still around and are now what I call ""pop metal"" lol."
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Kalmah."
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Dark Tranquillity"
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Wow it's hard to recommend because simply defining what melodic death metal is can be very polarizing. Essentially melodic death can have keyboards but don't necessarily have to have them. Most have clean vocals but not all. Music has to be either bouncy or catchy but still heavy and fun. Opeth I would not consider melodeath because some songs are just acoustic for the first half of the song so don't really fit in for me as a band that I can just put on and be a catchy, fun listening experience. 

However here are some in order of being more established and well known down to newer acts that deserve a listen. 

**Dark tranquillity** (no clean vocals on older stuff, give both 'character' and 'fiction' a listen) 

**In flames** (people will always say 'their older stuff is better, but I disagree there's some great stuff just skip the last two albums LOL) 

**Soilwork** (the third of the three main melodeath bands to listen to. They consistently put out quality material) 


The following are IMO Norwegian sounding bands.

**Kalmah** (for the revolution) 

**Norther** - (N) 

**Insefirum** - (from afar) 

**Wintersun** - (Wintersun) 

**Skyfire** -  (mind revolution) 

 
THE MELODEATH YOU SHOULD KNOW

**Scar Symmetry** - pitch black progress + dark matter dimensions 

**Solution 45** - for aeons past (Christian alvestam supergroup) 

**The unguided** - fragile immortality 

**Threat Signal** - (threat signal) 

**Borealis** - (fall from grace) 

**MyGrain**- MyGrain 

**Rise to Fall** - restore the balance 

**Disarmonia Mundi** -  fragments of D-Generation 

**I legion** - Beyond darkness 

**Sybreed** - Antares 

**Before the dawn** - deathstar rising

**Mercenary** - the hours that remain



Some good alternatives that lean towards power metal or deathcore. 

**Allegaeon** - formshifter 

**Imperanon** - Stained 





Bands with Girl singers:

**In this moment**

**The Agonist**

"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","The Black Dahlia Murder, Wretched, Alterbeast, Battlecross, At The Gates are all probably my favorite MDM bands at the moment. "
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Insomnium is king"
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","I am a fan of Escutcheon from the Netherlands. Heavier than usual melodeath, but a distinct Gothenburg influence."
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nV2FChGsJw all the bands inside this compilation"
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","**Arch Enemy** - Haven't given their newest stuff much of a listen (I heard they got a new vocalist to replace their previous one), but you can't go wrong with Anthems of Rebellion, Wages of Sin, or Doomsday Machine. I would also strongly recommend checking out their early works with their very first vocalist, since they do have quite a few solid tracks there.

**Blinded Colony** - This is quite an odd group since they're a Christian band (or they were at some point before changing their name to ""The Blinded"" because none of the original members of the group were left), but I would still recommend listening to Bedtime Prayers because it sounds good on its own merits and sounds quite secular as a whole (especially compared to their Divine release, which is very definitely a Christian album, despite how the music sounds heavier overall).

**Children of Bodom** - In my experience, a lot of their tracks might sound a bit samey or hard to distinguish from one another (although I haven't heard their latest release), but they do have some very good songs if you know where to look. I'd advise listening to tracks like Lake Bodom, Sixpounder, Bed of Razors, or Needled 24/7 before you decide to check them out extensively by albums.

**Dark Tranquility** - A classic group. If you're looking to get into them, I suggest checking out Damage Done, Character, and Fiction first.

**Deadlock** - Really good group with female vocalist. In my opinion, Manifesto is their magnum opus album (and also happens to be quite diverse in some ways). I cannot recommend it enough.

**Dimension Zero** - Really thrashy and rough sounding, but you might really like them. I would check out Silent Night Fever if you can listen to it.

**Disarmonia Mundi** - One of the greatest groups of melodic death metal. They have so much great work under their belt that it's easier for me to recommend you skip their Nebularium release altogether and check out anything else in their discography. They also did a few tracks on Princess Ghibli, a collection of metal covers of Miyazaki songs. If you start listening to them, you should probably know that they are already working on a new album that will be out early 2015.

**In Flames** - A very good group, but some of their work is hit or miss. They really changed a lot over the years. I would advise skipping their latest release entirely.

**Mercenary** - Amazing Danish melodic death metal group with a lot of power metal influences here or there. Be sure to check out 11 Dreams, The Hours That Remain, Architect of Lies, and Metamorphosis.

**Mnemic** - Another amazing Danish band. A lot of fans contend that their first album is very different and superior to their later work, but the only song I've heard from their earliest album was Liquid, and I did think it was a good track. The Audio Injected Soul is a must-listen if you check this group out. I also recommend Passenger and Sons of the System if you decide to keep listening to them. I would advise skipping Mnemesis, however.

**Omnium Gatherum** - I've only heard New World Shadows and Beyond so far, and judging from those albums I would highly recommend checking them out. They really have wonderful instrumentals and some of their music is surprisingly quite soothing.

**Scar Symmetry** - Most fans contend that Holographic Universe will always be their best album, but I would suggest checking that out along with Pitch Black Progress. After Holographic Universe, the original vocalist left the band and they released two albums that sounded okay for what they are, but did not compare to their first albums. Their latest release, however, sounds like the new group's attempt to redo Holographic Universe, but it is still well-made and worth listening to.

**Soilwork** - My gateway melodic death metal band. Will always hold a special place in my heart. Their first few albums are very rough around the edges, but easy to like if you're looking for something on the heavier side. Despite what people say about their works after Natural Born Chaos (Figure Number Five, Stabbing the Drama), they are still worth checking out. Also be sure to check out The Panic Broadcast and The Living Infinite. You could probably skip Sworn To A Great Divide and not miss out on much, as that was probably their most underwhelming album.

**Solution .45** - They only have one album out at the moment and they're a band by Christian Alvestam, the former vocalist of Scar Symmetry. I honestly think that if you are used to how he sounds in Scar Symmetry, then the album will take some time to grow on you, but it is worth it. I also believe they have a new release coming sometime in 2015, so now's a great time to start listening to them.

**Sonic Syndicate** - I've only really heard Only Inhuman and Love And Other Disasters so far, but I would still suggest those albums at the very least.

**Universum** - I've only listened to Mortuus Machina, but that was because a friend of mine a few years ago told me that Christian Alvestam was doing guest vocals on a few of the tracks. Not sure about their other works.

**Wintersun** - Stuff of legends. They only have two albums at the moment, but they are definitely worth every second of your time listening to them."
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","The Duskfall are an excellent, if mostly unknown, band. They recently got back together after six and a bit years and put out a new album, which is excellent."
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","I'd reccomend checking out:

Miseration- More straight up death metal but still very melodic and extremely catchy. Favorite album is Your Demons= Their Angels. Christian Alvestams on vocals too.

Black Sun Aeon- One of Tuomas Saukonnens side projects. More doom but still extremely good.

Dawn of Solace- Another one of Saukonnens side projects that only has one extremely good album.



"
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Listen to the ""big three"": Dark Tranquility, In Flames and At the Gates, also take a look at Insomnium, Omnium Gatherum, Be'lakor, Kalmah, Wintersun, and if you really want melodies give Scar Symmetry a try."
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Just someone please say The Black Dahlia Murderer already, great lists btw guys!"
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","A buddy of mine is a fan of them and got me into them, I forgot to post them in my OP. Thanks for mentioning them!"
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Opeth has always been a favorite of mine."
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Every metal fan of any kind should give Blackwater Park a listen, but they're not really melodeath. Still an incredible band"
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Sylosis, Bloodshot Dawn, In Vain, Gates of Ishtar."
"Good Melodic Death Metal band recommendations?","Xerath and Black Crown Initiate 

Both released albums in 2014 (III &amp; The Wreckage of Stars respectively), both stand up to multiple listens. "

"Scar Symmetry - The Iconoclast (Live 2010)","I don't think the new singers are bad at all.  It just isn't the same band to me."
"Scar Symmetry - The Iconoclast (Live 2010)","Gotta disagree. For me Scar Symmetry has always been about the compositions, interesting harmonic structures, and of course the guitar solos. The incredible vocals have always just been a plus in my mind. I also think Roberth is a much better growler, and I like how Lars has more of a power metal style vocal rather than a pop style. Absolutely love Christian's vocals though. "

"Soilwork - The Windswept Mercy","They really did. They're amazing live as well. I was hoping they'd play this song, but apparently they don't play it at all. At least not to my knowledge. I can't find it anywhere!"

"Soilwork - The Windswept Mercy","They are from the same recording session as TLI. So it's pretty impressive that they are so good, even compared to the original double album."
"Soilwork - The Windswept Mercy","Even though a lot of reviews said that this was the 'weak' track on the album, I don't see it. I love this song, because it's a very bright lead in to the end of the first disk, and that bridge section in the middle is mega.

Bjorn's vocals, both screaming and singing, is just phenomenal on this album."
"Soilwork - The Windswept Mercy","Did they really? Just goes to show that a lot of reviewers have no idea what they're talking about. This track is one of the best! And I agree, his vocals are outstanding; one of the best in the business for sure."
"Soilwork - The Windswept Mercy","Well, to be fair, they did say that saying it was the weakest was a bit mean because the entire standard of the album was ridiculous.

I went and saw them live about this time last year. Bjorn blasting out Tongue full bore was a thing of beauty"
"Soilwork - The Windswept Mercy","Still, I can't believe they called it the weakest! I guess music is subjective after all :)

I, too, was able to see them live last year. I actually half expected them to be bad for some reason, but I was blown away."
"Soilwork - The Windswept Mercy","I listened to this album religiously, then was fortunate enough to see them play some of it live. Unfortunately I drank a bit then got wrecked in the moshpit beforehand while Black Guard played. Actually, that was also fortunate. Edit: whoops, I said Black Flag."

"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","There's no Insomnium in this playlist? maybe I'm biased, but I think they're hands down the best Melodeath band on the planet. "
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","The whole point of these compilations is to discover bands you've never heard before, and your *only* comment is that a band you apparently know very well isn't there?  Let me guess, saw they weren't there, and didn't listen."
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","Actually, no. I listen to ~~5~~ 11 of these bands regularly and have heard around half of the songs prior to this compilation. Of the bands I listen to, I think that their songs on this compilation are neither their best, nor their most representative song.

I'm not trying to bash on this album - there are some very good songs and some very good bands, but personally I would like to add some things to the list. When lists like this are created, there seems to be an inherent problem of never being able to fully encapsulate every aspect of a subgenre.

If it's a Melodeath album, I don't necessarily agree with CoB being on there, as they're more of an Extreme Metal band, whereas Insomnium, who are THE definition of Melodeath, was snubbed. Dark Tranquility wasn't included. Not sure what their direction was on this list. 

Keep in mind, this is only my opinion. People are fully entitled to tell me I'm off the mark with my musical tastes, but then we arrive at the argument that music is subjective - that's all fine and dandy. But what isn't, is when people put words into my mouth. 


Edit: Was going off memory when I commented and i just now looked at the list again. Turns out I know a lot more of these bands well than I originally said. I've heard of most all of them, but I'm familiar with 11."
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","CoB is definitely melodeath. That's the consensus, anyway. I've heard them referred to as the ""Kings of Melodeath."" (although I don't agree with that title.)   
   
There are definitely more bands that could be on the album, but already has quite a few songs on it."
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","Hmm..they seem a bit too thrash-y to be MDM for me. Don't get me wrong, I've been playing CoB on spotify almost exclusively for the past week and a half - I love their music. I suppose my idea of melodic death metal is actually doom-infused, moody death metal, with growly vocals and emphasis on the guitar work and melodies. Kind of a happy medium between Wintersun's complex composition, Before the Dawn's melancholic, introspective mood, with Chrigel (Elveitie)'s vocals. 

Maybe it's time for my frame of reference to shift.

But hey, this subgenre is in need of diversity, and I'm really glad there are bands that are pushing the boundaries. On the contrary, Be'lakor is a great young band, but I'm a little worried that they'll fail to make a lasting innovation to the melodeath community.  

All around, this is a good compilation."
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","So many people into our style of music are like this. Shittay1"
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","Counter point - if someone has a vague interest in this genre and listens to this compilation without knowing the bands, they would be missing out on Insomnium.  Plus if it was to discover bands that you haven't heard of, why is Children of Bodom on there?  They are like 10x as popular as Insomnium."
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","Agreed that CoB is a little bit too big for a sampler like this(along with a couple other bands on it), but the tracklisting was probably decided by which bands the record company has rights to more than pushing the independent bands.  CoB might give just enough name recognition for someone to say hey if *they're* in this group, maybe I'll like the others.

That said, if I were to review the compilation, I wouldn't mention CoB and nobody else, let alone talk about bands that aren't on it."
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","Distortion Sleep, ahhh yes! "
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","Surprised, in a good way, to see Eluveite on this list. Think this will be my Monday morning listen. Cheers!"
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","Out of all the Arsis songs, ""We Are The Nightmare""? Very poor choice."
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","I'll be sure to pass this along to the compiler, who I obviously know personally... I'm sure they'll immediately revise the album to your liking :P"
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","LOL. I'm just saying it's one of their least melodic songs. Something like ""The Face of My Innocence"" or ""Wholly Night"" would probably be a better representation of both the band and the genre."
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","Yeah I do agree with that. ""We Are The Nightmare"" isn't very accessible-sounding to new listeners. I prefer the more melodic ones myself :) "
"An excellent compilation album: ""Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World""","Glad to see Deadlock on there.

Thanks for sharing, and thanks to /r/melodicdeathmetal for letting me discover all these awesome bands. I found Kalmah on this subreddit and it's practically all I listen to now."
"What is your new favorite band?","As in, who's your new favorite band that was founded in the last 2 or 3 years?"
"What is your new favorite band?","I recently got turned on to **In Vain**. They're a brand new melo-death band with an amazing first album. [Here's the opening song, Against the Grain.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4W7spPmaVk) They do a really good job of mixing clean and harsh vocals, especially in the second half of that song *(Transcend into the atmosphere, transcend into the atmosphere...)*. I also want to draw attention to the closing song of that album, [Floating on the murmering tide.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKT2IDFElow) It has a saxophone solo, a fucking *saxophone solo,* how cool is that?"
"What is your new favorite band?","Thank you for introducing me to this A- Fucking- Mazing band. Currently listening to Culmination of the Enigma and loving every second of it."
"What is your new favorite band?","You are aware they have 2 albums before AEnigma, right? Called ""Mantra"" and ""The Latter Rain"" (their actual debut album, from 2007 :P).

I haven't listened to them yet (just didn't get to that). But I will agree AEnigma is amazing."
"What is your new favorite band?","I didn't know that! Aenigma was the only one I could find, that just made my day!"
"What is your new favorite band?","Holy shit dude!  Looks like I got some homework tonight."
"What is your new favorite band?","Words Of Farewell!"
"What is your new favorite band?","Came here for this.

I hold them on the same level as Insomnium, Be'Lakor, Omnium Gatherum (post-Redshift) and Dark Tranquillity, and that is no small achievement."
"What is your new favorite band?","For me, it would have to be [Syndemic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My2QgiB4daE). [Starkill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMksX04WBA4) would definitely be a very close runner up for me as well."
"What is your new favorite band?","I wouldn't say favorite, but they're my current obsession. 

Terracide. They just released their first album pretty recently and the song The Forge of Empty Souls is so fucking metal! I love the riffs, the singing(both clean and growls) and the solo! The lyrics are really meaningful too! They're awesome! "
"What is your new favorite band?","Agree, these guys are unreal. I found them randomly on bandcamp a couple months ago."
"What is your new favorite band?","Mors Principium Est.... Holy shit this band is insane. I've been listening ""...And Death Said Live"" on repeat!!!"
"What is your new favorite band?","This. They kind of remind me of Disarmonia Mundi. No other band that I have found is similar, and DM is one of the best melodeath bands of all time."
"What is your new favorite band?","You should check out the Stranded if you're into Disarmonia Mundi. It's got two of DM's guys in it and they're really good."
"What is your new favorite band?","Have you listened to the earlier albums? And Death Said Live is fairly mediocre in comparison."
"What is your new favorite band?","Fucking Eluveitie! Helvetios is the best damn album I've heard in a long time."
"What is your new favorite band?","Few things :

1) They've been around for about 10 years (probably more... They already have around 5 albums to their names)

2) Origins is better then Helvetios, IMO. The second half of the album, including everything from Succellos on, is great. The Silver Sister and Carry the Torch were pleasant surprises for these guys.

3) Just because I want to keep everything in the same comment chain, they are very much a mix of melodeath with folly instruments and influences. Some songs make it more clear then others (Bloodstained Ground from one of their earlier albums, or the aforementioned section of Origins), but it's evident that they have a Dark Tranquillity-esque style about them.

4) Their tour with Winter sun last year was insane. And I kind of wish Anna did some more screams in general, because she wrecks them (The one in Sucellos, even if it's only as background, is chilling)"
"What is your new favorite band?","I've honestly just discovered them, but I noticed the huge melodeath influences, hence posting this here. Without the folk instruments they'd be a straight up melodeath band as far as I can tell, but the folky-ness is my favorite thing about them. "
"What is your new favorite band?","Well, keep on plowing through then! ""Slania"" and ""Spirit"" are two really good albums too. Some would say much better then both ""Helvetios"" and ""Origins"". The folky-ness definitely adds to the music - they really make it mesh well with the base melodeath sound.

They aren't spectacular or groundbreaking, but what they do they do extremely well, and hard to find elsewhere.

Just keep on enjoying these guys!"
"What is your new favorite band?","It's exciting to know my new favorite album is considered one of the least awesome by that band.

P.S. you couldn't stop me if you tried lol."
"What is your new favorite band?","I've always thought of them as more folk metal than melodeath, but their newest album Origins has definitely swung more towards melodic death metal.  Also I'd say that it's much better than Helvetios."
"What is your new favorite band?","I'll have to check that out. I'd agree with you, I went ahead with it cause they're wiki page includes melodeath and the only other melodeath band I've been jamming on at all is Amon Amarth and that's just lame to post lol."
"What is your new favorite band?","I actually didn't even realize they were considered melodeath until about a month ago.  I've seen them live a few times and Chrigel always refers the the band as ""pure fucking folk metal""."
"What is your new favorite band?","Yeah I'd say that's mostly true. They have some melodeath influences though that are pretty noticeable at times. "
"What is your new favorite band?","Helvetios was amazing. Truly amazing, my fav album from them by far. Origins was awesome too. "
"What is your new favorite band?","Can't both be true? Folk Metal just means metal with folk elements. The style of metal isn't specified. I too think Origins is their best so far. "
"What is your new favorite band?","[deleted]"
"What is your new favorite band?","The Unguided. They may have been founded longer than 3 years ago, but their first album was released in 2011."
"What is your new favorite band?","Wolfheart."
"What is your new favorite band?","Oh yeah those guys came out with a fucking epic debut album. Routa Pt. 2 will never get old for me. That intro will never fail to give me feels. Its like Saukonnen declared war on your eardrums and this was a blitzkrieg of awesome brutality."
"What is your new favorite band?","I haven't gotten into many new melo-death bands lately besides Be'lakor. Any recommendations?"

"What is your new favorite band?","I really do want to love EToS, but I just can't, and their among my ""alright"" bands. Their guy that does growls sounds like he's holding back most of the time, and their clean vocalist is too power metally for me. That being said their instramentals are incredible and when the guy that does growls lets loose, it's awesome."
"What is your new favorite band?","Omnium Gatherum - Beyond is the new melodeath standard IMHO."
"What is your new favorite band?","I feel like these guys are their own genre of melodeath. Like they're really atmospheric and most of their songs are really awesome slow beat to them and really long like Nightwalkers, Everfields, and Deep Cold. 

Their first two albums were more standard melodeath, but now I would call them atmospheric melodic death metal."

/u/rhapsodicink made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/melodicdeathmetal/comments/1vgx9w/best_melodeath_albums_of_2013/) a few months back requesting we update the 'Best Of' link, well, I kinda agree we should!

Comment below of which bands brought the best material in your opinion or personal fan favorites, and I'll edit this post to formulate the list and have it linked when it's near done! 

I'll leave this up for a few weeks to accomodate non-daily subscribers to voice their choices as well as get a majority of peoples opinions :)

Please ensure what you link/suggest is from 2013 (the album release date, not a release of a single)"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","Persefone - Spiritual Migration.

They span slightly across several genres, but for me this album is still as fresh as when I first heard it."
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","Omnium Gatherum- Beyond. Hands Down.
Not only did it win best Melodeath album of 2013, but it won my personal top album of 2013"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","Indeed, this album is pure gold!"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","I can't stop listening to them! It's my personal fav in the last 3 years"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","Soilwork - The Living Infinite

2 albums. 20 songs. Not one weak song at all."
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","Spectrum of Eternity has to have one of the most epic intros I've heard"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","I have never heard blast beats so quick/aggressive before. Dirk Verbeuren is just mega"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","Here is a previous thread on the matter: http://www.reddit.com/r/melodicdeathmetal/comments/1vgx9w/best_melodeath_albums_of_2013/"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","Yup! gonna incorporate it with this one 

"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","""Hundred Light Years"" by Lunarsea came in behind only Beyond for me.

""Spiritual Migration"" from Persefone (already mentioned) was great too.

I liked Dan Swano's project - ""The Inheritance"" by Witherscape.

""Surgical Steel"" by Carcass, ""Construct"" by Dark Tranquility are strong outputs by well-known bands.

""Sons of Aeon"" (Sons of Aeon) was a great debut (members from Ghost Brigade, Swallow the Sun) that's not very well known. Other not-well known albums I liked a lot were :

""The Resillution"" - Orpheus Omega

""Psycotic Kingdom"" - Harasai (starts slow but ramps up fast, imo)

""The Gift of Life"" - Dreamshade

""Origin"" - Enshine"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","Nice, thanks to you, i've added some music to my collection :D"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","I started digging a bit more in the underground for stuff last year, so whenever I can link to something someone hasn't heard before and they like it, it's a nice bonus."
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","[Craving - At Dawn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9W1A4ITHgA) Oct 2013

I had this album playing nonstop on release. So good."
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","I hadn't heard this before! This is wonderful, thanks for sharing!
"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","""The Arsonist"" by Deadlock. (July 2013)
A unique album to say the very least."
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","I was very pleasantly surprised. The last one or two releases from them have been underwhelming to say the least. Definitely worth a listen. Or twelve. :) "
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","At first I was very very confused, but I should have seen the new sound coming, what with Sebastian toting around that 8-string.  Going to have to disagree with you about Manifesto and Bizarro World though, especially the latter.  Perhaps not as pure melodeath, but BW is actually my all time favorite album.  In general though, Deadlock are some seriously underrated metallers. "
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","It would be so awesome if someone made a montage of the different melodic death metal gigs/albums released last year"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","Really shocked not to see mygrain - planetary breathing and degradead - the monster within not on this list"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","Added. I'm keeping this up for a few weeks to hopefully get the opinion of many people :)"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","Tribulation-Formulas Of Death"
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","Yes! This is what I was looking for."
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","I realize I'm late to the party, but I was disappointed in how many of these albums *aren't* on youtube as a full album.  I spend most of my day listening to music on youtube, and I buy anything I listen to regularly -- the try-before-you-buy is why I own all the Insomnium albums and most of In Flames.  I'm still dithering over whether I like Soilwork and Agalloch enough to listen regularly.  But when I can't easily listen to it, I won't buy it.

So please, someone commit copyright violation and upload full albums (or, better yet, the band can create their own channel and upload)."
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","I use [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) for any browsing needs. It basically has every artist ever in it, and pays the artist a [very small] amount of money per play. I don't know if its service is available in your country, but it works fine for most of the US and Europe."
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","It wasn't clear to me whether Spotify had all the songs from a given album.  I really enjoy listening to albums end to end.  But I'll give it a whirl when I'm back at work."
"Best Melodeath Albums of 2013","Yeah, Spotify has everything as long as you're not listening to it on mobile. The only downside is that it throws a commercial into the mix every so often, but its not too often."

"[META] What do you listen to your music on? Any audiophiles in here? Have you found any gear that is particularly good for metal?","I'm curious as to what kind of setups you guys listen to your metal on, mainly those who are experienced with a wide variety of headphones, amps, DACs and other related audio equipment. 

Recently, I have started getting into audio, (I was one of the lucky people to get a Sennheiser HD598 on sale) and as I read and learn more about people's audio setups, I figured I'd ask people who listen to the same music as I do what kind of gear they're using and if they have any special opinions relating to melodic death metal.

I'm trying to evaluate if I'm satisfied with my current setup which is my new HD598's plugged into an older (2nd generation, I think) Astro mixamp that I bought like 4 years ago (It at least it beats the alternative of just plugging it into my GA-P67A-UD5-B3 mobo).

The sound on my setup is undoubtedly the best I've owned, but that bar is set pretty low. I'm overall pretty happy with my purchase but some tracks (even on flacs, not shitty 128kps mp3 or youtube) sound pretty muddy; especially with drums that have heavy cymbal usage. It tends to not be as crisp as I think it should be and perhaps blurred together. 

Anyways, as someone learning more about audio, I'm curious as to what you guys have to say, especially if any of you are very experienced with many headphones and would have specific gear recommendations to listing to this kind of music. If this doesn't go well I might post it elsewhere on a different sub to get more opinions.

"[META] What do you listen to your music on? Any audiophiles in here? Have you found any gear that is particularly good for metal?","Im alternating between Beyerdynamic DT990 and DT770 depending on if I want to be able to hear what's going on around me. Using the DT770 is for fully immersed mode!

To drive this I have a Fiio E09K together with a Fiio E17. The sound is on the warm side, but I love it!"
"[META] What do you listen to your music on? Any audiophiles in here? Have you found any gear that is particularly good for metal?","Original Acoustic Energy AE1 speakers, John Shearne phase 2 amplifier and a Sony CDP-311 CD player. Old equipment but it's fantastic: incredibly crisp and well-balanced. The source is probably the weak link in the system, either being a laptop or the CD player depending on what I'm listening to. I'll agree with the guy below who said that real speakers are a must for Metal, too. "
"[META] What do you listen to your music on? Any audiophiles in here? Have you found any gear that is particularly good for metal?","I'm using a Burson HA160-DS, which is a DAC and Headphone Amplifier combo. All discrete solid state, heaps of resolution and power. My headphones are some Lawton Audio modified Denon AH-D2000's.

My library is pretty much all FLAC (very few exceptions) and I can say that my setup has definitely made a difference. The Denon headphones are known for being very bass heavy, but the modifications tighten that up, improve the soundstage and positioning and balance. The Burson has a strong bass response, seemingly unlimited power to drive and deliver the blast beats. It has superb PRAT (Pace Rythm Attack Timing), which makes the drums sound almost pneumatic sometimes. No matter the complexity nothing gets lost. You can hear the cymbals from all directions and drum rolls go around your head.

My rig is pretty expensive ($1500AUD), but for me the investment was worth it. Having heard a lot of headphones the Sennheiser's were decent, but they didn't me away. But then again, they were friendly on the wallet. The headphones are always the most important, but don't forget the electronics.

Subreddits such as /r/headphones are helpful, and /r/audiophile (although audiophile doesn't really cater to new questions, but there are no other suitable subs to direct you to).

I found that once I added a powered sub, there was no going back to anything else.  That one piece gave the music that physical component - I can *feel* the music the way I can on the rail of a live show.

One thing I find though is the clearer the sound, the less loud it sounds to me.  Yes, I've had my hearing tested and it's fine(somehow).  So I'm always disappointed it's not louder, even though it is."
"[META] What do you listen to your music on? Any audiophiles in here? Have you found any gear that is particularly good for metal?","598 is a great starting place for headphones.

I've been running a Schiit Valhalla + HD650 + Fiio E17dac for awhile now, and this setup sounds good for every kind of music I've thrown at it, including metal. Perfect amount of highs/mids/lows for my tastes.

I have some Grado225i that are great for most types of metal/rock, but not so great for anything else and also some PSB M4U2 that I use for public places that sound pretty good all types of music.

I used to use a X-Fi Titanium HD in my desktop but it wasn't portable and the Xonar U3 sounds the same through my speakers and headphones, so I just run everything through the U3 now."

And when it comes to Metal, and especially the more heavy kind like melodeath, death or metalcore there is no substitution for real speakers. Metal is also one of the hardest things for a speaker to play, and will usually sound like shit on a average stereo. Another problem is that most ""Metal"" is recorded in poor quality. 

Walk in to any serious Hi-Fi shop and ask if you could test some of the better audio equipment they have. Take with you your setup for comparison.

Always use a good source!

Hi all,

I'm a big fan of both In Flames and At The Gates. I Saw In Flames already a few times, last time being last oktober, when they played in the AB, in Brussels, Belgium. I saw At The Gates two times at their last 'farewell'-tour in 2008. Both at Graspop and Wacken, they brought an amazing show, and I was totally sold on them, too bad they quit shortly after that.. Or so I thought, and on the 18th of december, I'll see them in Antwerp!  

Now, the last few weeks I started listening to Dark Tranquility again. I followed them quite some time ago, but for one reason or another, I lost track of them completely. Now, by listening to them again, I notice how much In Flames, At The Gates and Dark Tranqility have in common:  
  
* When playing [Lost To Apathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIyFHzRW0A) from Dark Tranquility in my head, it is automatically followed by a riff and lyrics from [Slaughter of the Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URhmC865SGI) by At The Gates.  
* [My Negation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsyv7aPMTQ4) from Dark Tranqsuility and [Fear is the Weakness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLwa5gky-BU) by In Flames have quite the riff in common.  
  
Just my two cents on a few of my favorite bands. I very much like Melodic Death Metal because it has that nice melody going through the pounding of guitar, bass and drums. The combination of 'clean' vocals and grunting/screaming makes sure I keep my interest and don't fall into the ""It's all screaming and I don't understand anything from the lyrics""-type of listener.  
  
PS: If you've noticed similar patterns in songs of these bands (or others), please point them out to me!  
PSS: If you know other bands with similar sounds, please post some songs, so that I can get to know them."

"G√∂teborg Melodeath (X-post from /r/Metal)","Im not good at analyzing songs and genres etc But here are some things that I enjoy that fit your description (loosely). But a lot of these songs are not just melodeath but combinations with other genres.


* [opeth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oWhkjQWE24)  Melodeath/progressive. This is the band that got me into melodeath and is still my favorite band. It mixes progressive metal with melodic death. You should definitely check out their album Blackwater park.


* [Agalloch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHJjSSrR6x4)  Melodeath band that uses a lot of clean vocals. But some people dont really like their clean vocals.


* [Between the Buried and me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcHv-VNFypA)  Another progressive/melodeath band now also with some metalcore influence. Using a lot of more silent parts with calm vocals.

* [The Agonist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdT7M4f2L9A) Band with female singer that also sings quite a lot of cleans. I guess you kinda dig it or you don't..

* [Iced Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi2byoKN-GM) Not really melodeath but I really also like this band.


Sorry if you already knew most of them and dislike the ones you don't know. I also only recently started listening to melodeath. And most bands just don't use clean vocals...
"
"G√∂teborg Melodeath (X-post from /r/Metal)","I love Iced Earth, lost track of them too, to be honest, but listened a lot to them few years back.  
  
I know Opeth allready, just don't consider them in the same genre as DT, IF and ATG, but that's just me probably :p  
It's sooo difficult to diversify into genres, defo genres in the metal-genre. To me, it's all about the sound, not what name there's on it"
"G√∂teborg Melodeath (X-post from /r/Metal)","Yeah totally agree. Also did you go to graspop last summer? DT, Opeth en Carcass played. It was great!"
"G√∂teborg Melodeath (X-post from /r/Metal)","Yeah, I go to Graspop every year, I work there backstage. Didn't get to see DT, and I feel very bad about it, but I was at shift at that moment.."
"G√∂teborg Melodeath (X-post from /r/Metal)","Ah that sucks. It was my first graspop (im only 18) and I was really happy that a lot of my favorite bands played. Dark tranquility was really great in my opinion. I really liked the videos playing on the back panels."
"G√∂teborg Melodeath (X-post from /r/Metal)","Agalloch as melodeath?

I have no idea if somehow they are different after The Mantle and Ashes Against the Grain, but they are far from melodeath in either case. Atmospheric Black/Folk (edit : Oh yeah, and Doom) is as close as you're going to get in there. Opeth has it's moments (and inspired a lot of the big melodeath bands in some way, so it's normal to associate some of the sounds in melodeath to them, and thus them to melodeath). Don't listen to the other 3, but iirc they fall into progressive/metalcore, metalcore and heavy, respectively.

I think you use the melodeath umbrella as holding a lot more then it normally should. Which is fairly normal when you get to some prog / metalcore (blame At The Gates for that influence there) stuff. With time you start to notice the differences and similarities between the groupings, and sometimes even the influences that go between them."
"G√∂teborg Melodeath (X-post from /r/Metal)","Sorry man as I said I don't know a lot about genres and I also said those are just bands that popped in my head when I read his post. But you are probably right yes."
"G√∂teborg Melodeath (X-post from /r/Metal)","No worries.

At least you have good tastes with Opeth and Agalloch :P"
"G√∂teborg Melodeath (X-post from /r/Metal)","How we're at 14 comments and I don't think we saw a single mention of Insomnium is beyond me. Maybe look into ""Mortal Share"", ""Down With The Sun"" and ""While We Sleep"" as an intro.

Look at their first album (In The Halls of Awaiting) - there's a significant (imo) In Flames' type riffing going on. Then they just evolve from there into their current state (/greatness). Nillo's growls are pretty clear, imo, and they incorporate some cleans in the 2nd half of their discrography (Across The Dark - on).

I'll also second the mentions of Be'Lakor (""From Scythe To Sceptre"" or ""Neither Shape Nor Shadow""), Omnium Gatherum (go for the last 2 albums, for songs try ""Ego"", ""New World Shadows"" or ""New Dynamic""), Mors Principium Est, Ghost Brigade (although they aren't really melodeath, still have a sound that's similarly enjoyable - go for some random stuff off either Isolation Songs or IV - One With The Storm). You can also try Words of Farewell."

My question is, is there any other site besides Amazon where I can access the album? Amazon's price is around $15 without shipping, and I can;t really justify spending that right now. Or if anyone knows why MPE has pulled their music from the US, as I haven't been able to find any information on that either.

"Saturnus - Veronika Decides To Die (2006)","Jesus, way to dig back in the archives ;P

There are some bands that do change genres, but to say that happens often wouldn't be something I would agree with, from the experience I know. There are some tweaks perhaps in how they approach the sound, but bands more often then not stay in the same genre limits.

It's not impossible that they change genres between albums, but I wouldn't say often either. From the myriad of bands I listen to, there are very few who outright change."
"Saturnus - Veronika Decides To Die (2006)","Well, my 3 favorite bands somehow did. Empyrium started with Gothic/Doom metal, all dark and kvltish in its music quality. That was only an EP, though. The following album had electric guitars, yes, and it sounded similar to some avant-garde doom metal mixture with rock. Following albums were mostly acoustic German neofolk. Ulver has had so many genres that I'm not going to mention them all. It has had a purely electronic era, black metal, acoustic neofolk, rock and whatnot. And Haggard, my absolute favorite band, started with progressive death metal and progressed into a mixture of classical music and symphonic death metal. 

Super popular bands tend not to change because the fans want that kind of music. It would be unthinkable for Arch Enemy to suddenly release a jazz album, or Nightwish to start playing black metal with synths (Dimmu Borgir style).

I'm not saying it's most bands either. It's many times already have I opened a YT video thinking I'm going to find some instrument playing in some tone and I get surprised with some other completely different thing. There was, for example, a Spanish pop group that I loved so much that an album of theirs was the only one that I kept for a bit more than a decade. I always listened to it, but I realized that they probably had a lot more music than that album, so I downloaded the discography and listened to their starting tracks. It's 80s disco music. Aqua released a song recently, I was thinking it was some more barbie girl or candyman styled music, but it was a lot darker and serious, and it was some helluva surprise for me (I'm talking about the track My Momma Said).

So yeah, you're right in that it's not most, it's not half, it's just some minority of the music artists in the world, but it's a significant amount of bands and I think that you can't just assume that because some guys played doom metal before it's unthinkable that they might release melodeath afterward.

Still, I'm not saying it's melodeath or not. I haven't listened past the second track."

"Svavelvinter album?","Its made by Christian Alvestam its worth getting"
"Svavelvinter album?","4 tracks for $30 is pretty steep.  I don't know if I can justify that."
"Svavelvinter album?","It's still about 40 minutes long. It's 4 tracks that's about the length of many 10+ track albums."
"Svavelvinter album?","Not bad but $30? :/"
"Svavelvinter album?","I was hesitant, too. But he'll sign it for you, too! And shipping doesn't cost any extra - which isn't bad considering he's in Sweden."
"Svavelvinter album?","That is cool. If you'd be willing to rip it in 320, I would be willing to toss some money your way since they haven't bothered to release it digitally. "
"Svavelvinter album?","I don't have it yet. Just ordered today. Hopefully they release digitally soon, but I'll see what I can do when it comes."
"Svavelvinter album?","That would be awesome.  They say it takes about a month to receive and they do it themselves.  Just let me know.  Appreciate it man."

EDIT: Oh wait... None of my friends listen to metal and I work too much... that's how."
"Ensiferum - ""One Man Army"" (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","Much better than the last album I can tell already. Not that the last album was bad, it just lacked compared to previous ones in my opinion.  "
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","title, **would** be better if they are from scandinavia

**edit**: alright thanks a lot to everybody who posted, if you have some more to share just please check if anybody other didn't posted it"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Be'Lakor, Omnium Gatherum, Before the Dawn, Dark Tranquillity, Dawn of Solace, Swallow the Sun, Words of Farewell, maybe Ghost Brigade?

Those are all some pretty mellow melodeath bands. Some of my favorites. Go to Insomnium's Encyclopedia Metallum page and look under the ""Similar Artists"" tab for more suggestions."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Already knew Ghost Brigade and Be'Lakor. I don't really know why but i don't really enjoy Omnium Gatherum but yeah thanks for the other bands"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Just to further reinforce, Words of Farewell is an amazing band.  I recommend ""Vagrant Story"" and ""Ever After"" in particular, but both albums from them are just great from start to finish."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Curious - When you say you don't really enjoy Omnium Gatherum - which of their albums did you check out? Because I can see not enjoying some of them, but I find it bizarre that one who likes Insomnium can't enjoy their later 2 albums, considering the Vanhala influence. If you liked Ephemeral, Out To The Sea and Revelations, (all from the latest Insomnium), then New World Shadows/Beyond (the albums) should at the least be interesting."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","I listened to 'Beyond' (the album) but i don't even know why i didn't enjoyed.. it's just it wasn't what i was really looking for"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","I see.

Try the New World Shadows album and see if that does anything. And if not, well, you just don't like them, which is fine ;P I was asking because maybe you had started with their earlier stuff, which is very far from their newer stuff."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","I will later, listening to the other stuff that people posted atm"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Maybe it's the vocals that you dislike? Although I absolutely love their melodies (seriously, they've got some of the best I've ever heard) I can't really stand the vocals, I too don't even know why I dislike them ... I like Amon amarth, insomnium, DT, in flames etc. but for some reason I just can't bring myself to like OG's singer."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","I just don't know.. but i like those other bands that you named so i guess it might be that"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","[deleted]"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Swallow the sun is more death/doom than melodeath in case that matters to you."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Good luck, I have never heard a more beautiful song than Lay of the Autumn by Insomnium. Un. Matched.


Insomnium are the kings of MDM right now and it is for good reason."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","To me, Countless Skies by Be'lakor and Pure by Mors Principium Est are some of the finest examples of Melodic Death Metal I've ever come across. If you haven't heard of either song, I highly recommend you do!"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Meh thanks, began to search a lot of time ago.. found some cool stuff but nothing really close to Insomnium, they are so awesome"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","I think bands like Dark Tranquillity and Amon Amarth are more entitled to the term ""kings of MDM"". They are amongst the ones that shaped the genre and Insomnium got it's sound from.

Don't get met wrong, I wouldn't go as far as calling Insomnium a bad band, I have listened to them for extended periods and I don't know why I don't *really* like them, but if I had to put it in to an analogy I would say their music is like a canal: It starts somewhere, it goes somewhere. At some places it gets wider, at some less wide. At some places it flows quicker than at others, there might drive a boat through there. It's a perfectly fine waterway, but it remains a canal, purposely built with safe straight walls, and lacks the adventure and searching spirit of a river.

edit: People who like Insomnium might also want to look in to [doom-death](http://www.reddit.com/r/doommetal) and [post metal](http://www.reddit.com/r/postmetal). They tend to have a similar atmosphere. Also early Katatonia (Brave Murder Days)"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Don't get me wrong, i don't mean that those 2 bands sucks. Actually not at all, they were both okay and i'll certainly listen to them sometimes but it's just that it's not what i'm looking for. I'm not saying that i'm an 'extreme mdm' fan, i actually enjoy most of the mdm bands but infact i'm not searching for melodic metal bands, i'm searching for something close to Insomnium and you guys might think that Omnium Gatherum is close to it and yea, i'm not saying that you are wrong, but it's not to me. I didn't enjoyed them as i enjoy Insomnium and that's pretty much what i'm searching for, something to like in the way that i like Insomnium. Anyways sorry for my bad english."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Most certainly everyone is entitled to find any band their most favorite, by all means be my guest :). My issue, if you want to call it that, is more with people who put any band on a pedestal and anything anyone else says is in their eyes invalid criticism. Music taste is a very personal thing.

Anyway, If you like the broody aspect of Insomnium, the genres I pointed to in my edit have a lot of this as well. In that case /r/atmosphericmetal might also be to your liking."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Oh, didn't really mean to look like that.. my apologies if i did, but as I've already wrote before it's just i'm look for a certain kind of bands, even if other ones are good that isn't what i'm searching at the moment but be sure that i'll listen to them in the future! Anyways thanks a lot, i'll give a look there too."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","No worries, I was afraid of the same really.

Just saw I had [this album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc7jnAJaMc) from Wolfheart which may be to your liking. Comes pretty close in my opinion."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Somebody already said Wolfheart but didn't really knew which songs should i try. That album sounds so nice i really like it, thanks."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","I agree with you. Dark Tranquillity is my #1 band of all time and beats out Insomnium. However, I stated 'right now' as in they are going full force while bands like Amon Amarth and DT have wound down like a lot of bands have due to their status and longevity. DT has been at it for 20+ years and are still going strong. But if I had to put a band out there that is currently 'it', it would be Insomnium.


And it's okay, this whole music bit is all subjective. I don't even care for Omnium Gatherum and this sub eats their ass. Everyone has their own opinion."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","I'd go for Persefone (Spiritual Migration is probably my favourite album of last year) and Omnium Gatherum."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Listening to the album atm, some songs are awesome even if it isn't really what i was searching for"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Omnium Gatherum is probably as close as you're gonna get. You can hear Omnium influences on Insomnium's new album."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","How about In Mourning (they are Swedish, for what it's worth)?  Try their most recent album The Weight of Oceans"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Maybe [Noumena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYSzIFPlShY) is something you like? And check out [Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ykt8_19GtJ4) and [Words of Farewell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy473boOcgE) as others have mentioned"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Thanks a lot for the links, didn't really knew which songs to listen with the other bands.
**edit**: that first song is awesome"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","And now I know about Words of Farewell, thanks!"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Equivalence is exactly like insomnium. Even named after the song of the same name from insomnium."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Thanks a lot man, imo this one is the closest, listened some stuff they all sound nice"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","How did I not know about these guys...

Although it's more a mix of Be'Lakor, In Mourning and Insomnium, imo, but it's definitely interesting."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Eternal Tears of Sorrow.  Start with Saivon Lapsi.  "
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","[This](http://www.infinitelooper.com/?v=SUDlkEmwvWs) is just awesome"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Check out Omnium Gatherum, esp if you enjoyed Insomniums newest album. "
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Eternal Tears of Sorrow, In Mourning, Dawn of Tears, Daylight Dies."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Omnium Gatherum comes pretty close, but there is nothing quite like Insomnium to be honest."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Haven't seen Wolfheart on here yet, so yeah that's a really great one."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Wintersun!"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","I'd recommend Eluveite. They aren't that close to Insomnium to be honest, but stick with me. Insomnium are by far my favourite metal band, and I've really struggled finding anything similar (besides the usual DT, at the gates). 

So why have I recommended them? They have some super melodic songs, if you feel you could like something melodic but more folk orientated give them a try. If you don't like them then at least you know!

Regardless, good luck with your search. http://youtu.be/lMY-Q2T0OIY"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Hey thanks a lot for this one. I also love folk metal so this one was amazing to me"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Glad to hear it! the whole Slania album is great. In my mind it runs like a concept album. 

This is one of the main reasons I love metal. So many different su genres to explore. "
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Dark tranquility is pretty similar to Insomnium and they're from Sweden. You should try them if you haven't already."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Thanks, listened some songs and they sound okay. I'll search for more stuff later."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","[Snatched Cord](http://youtu.be/qV5esfWdUJE) has a very similar style. Other than that, I suggest asking this in /r/Metal101; those guys can probably help you out a lot."
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Amon Amarth, Before the Dawn, Swallow the Sun"
"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Already knew Amon Amarth and the other 2 bands were already posted but thanks anyways!"

"Looking for bands like Insomnium","Just stumbled on this band... [Watch Me Fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9absEhEsj28).

Nillo Sevanen (Insomnium) sings in it, and Ville Friman (Insomnium) also plays on this, and was the main writer...

They only had one album, because after that they basically ended up focusing on Insomnium, but hey."

"OMNIUM GATHERUM - EVERFIELDS","Great music. Unfortunately the vocals don't do it for me. "
"OMNIUM GATHERUM - EVERFIELDS","Just out of curiosity, how come?"
"OMNIUM GATHERUM - EVERFIELDS","I suspect that it doesn't click with me because of the narrow tonal range. I got started in melodic metal with Soilwork and since that's what I can in on, now I prefer a vocalist to have good range. I can do all harsh vocals, but it doesn't usually resonate with me unless there's at least good range to it. This band has incredible musical talent though, I would love an instrumental track. "
"OMNIUM GATHERUM - EVERFIELDS","Odd because I personally can't stand Bjorn (Strid, of Soilwork). Something just doesn't do it for me.

Everfields isn't the best example of Juuka's versatility though... compared to The Unknowing, New World Shadows, or Who Could Say."
"OMNIUM GATHERUM - EVERFIELDS","I'll youtube those when I get the chance. Music is kind of weird in that bands can be incredibly talented, even objectively ""good"" and yet sometimes something just doesn't work for the listener. Thanks for the recommendations!"

"OMNIUM GATHERUM - EVERFIELDS","I know what you mean. I respect any band that breaks out into popularity like In Flames, or Soilwork, even though I might not personally enjoy their style."
"OMNIUM GATHERUM - EVERFIELDS","Yeah the harsh vocals are something that kind of grows on you with any type of metal.

They do have a couple songs with clean vocals in them, sung all by the lead singer, but they don't sound good at all honestly. "
"OMNIUM GATHERUM - EVERFIELDS","I hear you. It's not bad, I'm sure I could probably grow into it.

"Bands like Whispered?","Can someone suggest bands similar to Whispered? I'm not too familiar with MDM so feel free to suggest new or old stuff. I'm coming from more of a progressive metal background but getting into some heavier stuff. 

More specifically on what I'm looking for:

-High energy

-Abundance of solos/heavily guitar-focused style

-Lots of melody, don't mind a little cheese

I've seen some people say Whispered has a ""Japanese"" style but I figured it was just the oriental guitar and lyrical themes. However, I recently discovered the Japanese band Thousand Eyes which has some of the similar traits I listed above, so maybe there's more to it than that? I do really enjoy the stuff that reminds me of Japanese RPG music (check the solo on ""Bloody Empire"" by Thousand Eyes for an example, especially around the 3:10 mark).

Anyway, all suggestions will be appreciated!"
"Bands like Whispered?","[deleted]"
"Bands like Whispered?","I know of all those bands and I'm sure I've checked them out at one point or another, but for whatever reason they just didn't strike a chord with me. I'd have to check them out again to tell what I did/didn't particularly like about them. Coming from a progressive metal mindset, I would definitely stress that what I really enjoy is some technicality behind the guitars. 

If I'm not mistaken, all those bands have been around for a long time, right? If there are particular albums that you think would fit what I'm looking for, I'll check them out again. I know that a lot of these bands that stick around for a long time end up changing their style a bit. 

Funny that you mention Kalter because that's another band that I think is fantastic, at least their last album Ubuntu (still need to check out Spiritual Angel). I think Ubuntu was cross-posted on r/progmetal which is how I found out about them. I was pretty bummed to hear they broke up recently. 

If it helps, a couple other examples of bands I've really gotten into recently are Allegaeon and Persefone."

"Bands like Whispered?","Give [Tengger Cavalry](http://tenggercavalry.bandcamp.com/) a try. Mongolian folk / death, weak on the guitar solo front but otherwise ticks all your boxes."
"Bands like Whispered?","Maybe not so heavy on the Asian element in the first album, but more so in the second. But not in the same way as Whispered. But I LOVE whispered and they are really high up on my favorite bands list. You should definitely check out Wintersun and Kalisia. Both just inhuman musical ability of albums. Kalisia isn't asian sounding metal, but they cross several genre sounds in their album and I felt it was worth a mention anyway."
"Bands like Whispered?","I'm a fan of Wintersun, moreso Time I than self-titled so I'm really looking forward to Time II. I actually bought Kalisia on a whim years ago but don't think I ever gave it the chance it deserved. I'll have to revisit that one."
"Bands like Whispered?","A quick list of impressions for several of your recommendations: 

Children of Bodom - Follow the Reaper: pretty good stuff. Of all the bands recommended here that I've checked out so far (still more to go!) this is probably the closest to what I'm looking for. I also listened to Halo of Blood. Not exactly crazy about the vocals but the music makes up for it.

Nevermore, Protest the Hero - already listen to these guys. Love 'em.

Obscura - most tech-death bands don't do it for me, but I actually like Omnivium a lot. I think it's the only tech-death album I own.

Shangren - not bad but doesn't quite grab me. The production is pretty poor and that can turn me off. I really prefer when the mixing/mastering is really ""clean."" 

Revocation - gave these guys a serious shot a couple months ago but they didn't stick. Fantastic solos but everything beyond the solos doesn't grab me. 

In Flames - only album I had really listened to by them was A Sense of Purpose, which I've come to find out is one of their weaker efforts. Listened through Colony in it's entirety and it's much better.

Tengger Cavalry - these guys are interesting. Again, the production takes it down a notch for me, and I'm not a fan of the vocals. I do like the strings/oriental guitar aspects of it though.

Scar Symmetry - Holographic Universe is in my top 5 albums. Christian-era Scar Symmetry is pretty much the ideal band for my tastes. They, along with Opeth, were a huge step in getting me to appreciate some growlies in my music. 

Solution .45 - not quite as good as Christian-era SS, but a decent substitute. Looking forward to their next album.

Knight Who Says Nee - I'll have to get to your recommendations in a follow-up post...

So is it just a coincidence or fluke that Thousand Eyes (Japanese band) and Whispered (Japanese style) have what I'm looking for? I notice that there haven't been any other Japanese band recommendations."
"Bands like Whispered?","Idk about Thousand Eyes but Whispered is actually not from Japan. They are from Finland I believe but they are heavily influenced by Japanese culture. "
"Bands like Whispered?","Right, that's why I said Japanese style. "

"Carcass - This Mortal Coil","Heartwork is a classic and is generally accepted as the first proper Melodic Death Metal album ever released. It's not quite the same as what the early Swedish bands were doing though. The Swedes were doing a lot of fast harmonized single string picking while Carcass played in a more tradition style even closer to Iron Maiden. If you like Slaughter of the Soul by At the Gates or Black Earth and Stigmata by Arch Enemy you will really dig this album."

"Looking for new suggestions based on some of my favorites as of recent.","I'll repost this from the other thread. 

&gt;**Blackguard**: I'd recommend both of their albums, Profugus Mortis and Firefight. They're a pretty fun Melodic Death/Folk Metal band.

&gt;**Blood Stain Child**: An interesting band that somehow fuses Melodic Death Metal and Trance of all things. I've only really given their album [Epsilon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vobp17bP17c) a listen, but it's really fucking good stuff.

&gt;**Carcass**: I'd recommend Heartwork and their newest release, Surgical Steel.

&gt;**Children of Bodom**: I haven't given them an extensive listen, but I know Children of Bodom is all sorts of fun Melodic Death/Power Metal.

&gt;**Dark Tranquillity**: One of the pioneering Melodic Death Metal bands. I'd recommend Haven, Damage Done, Character, Fiction, We Are the Void, and Construct. Mikael Stann's vocals are amazing.

&gt;**Disarmonia Mundi**: I'd recommend Fragments of D-Generation, Mind Tricks (+re-release), The Isolation Game, and The Restless Memoirs (EP). Soilwork's Bjorn Strid did a ton of vocals for this band.

&gt;**Eternal Tears of Sorrow**: I've only listened to their album, Saivon Lapsi, but their entire discography seems good to me.

&gt;**The Few Against Many**: Their sole album, SOT, is incredible, especially because they have Christian Alvestam on vocals.

&gt;**Hypocrisy**: I'd recommend Abducted, The Final Chapter, Hypocrisy, Into the Abyss, Catch 22, The Arrival, Virus, A Taste of Extreme Divinity, and End of Disclosure. Hypocrisy is one of my absolute favorite bands that definitely emphasizes the Death Metal part of Melodic Death Metal, as well as Peter Tagtgren's vocals being fucking awesome.

&gt;**In Flames**: One of the pioneering Melodic Death Metal bands. I'd recommend The Jester Race, Black-Ash Inheritance, Whoracle, Colony, Clayman, Reroute to Remain, Soundtrack to Your Escape, and Come Clarity. In Flames was one of the bands that got me into Melodic Death Metal.

&gt;**Kalmah**: I'd recommend [their entire discography.](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Kalmah/702)

&gt;**KaÃàlter**: I'd recommend both albums, Spiritual Angel and Ubuntu.

&gt;**Mercenary**: I'd recommend 11 Dreams, The Hours That Remain, Architect of Lies, and Metamorphosis. 

&gt;**Mnemic**: I've only listened to Sons of the System, but Mnemic overall seems good.

&gt;**Parasite Inc.**: I'd recommend their sole album, Time Tears Down.

&gt;**Raintime**: I'd recommend Tales From Sadness, Flies &amp; Lies, and Psychromatic.

&gt;**Satariel**: I'd recommend Hydra, and White Ink: Chapter One.

&gt;**Scar Symmetry**: I'd recommend Symmetric in Design, Pitch Black Progress, Holographic Universe, Dark Matter Dimensions, The Unseen Empire, and The Singularity (Phase I - Neohumanity). After Holographic Universe, they parted ways with Christian Alvestam, and picked up Lars Palmqvist and Roberth Karlsson (note: TWO VOCALISTS) to replace him. Scar Symmetry was one of the bands that got me into Melodic Death Metal.

&gt;**Shade Empire**: While Shade Empire is a mixture of a lot of genres, I'd highly recommend Omega Arcane.

&gt;**Skyfire**: I'd recommend their entire discography. I haven't given Skyfire an extensive listen, but it's good.

&gt;**Soilwork**:  I'd recommend A Predator's Portrait, Natural Born Chaos, Figure Number Five, Stabbing the Drama, Sworn to a Great Divide, The Panic Broadcast, and The Living Infinite. Soilwork is one of the bands that got me into Melodic Death Metal, and Bjorn Strid's vocals are amazing.

&gt;**Solution .45**: I'd recommend their sole album, For Aeons Past. Christian Alvestam is the vocalist. I don't have to say anymore, really.

&gt;**Sonic Syndicate**: I'd recommend Eden Fire, Only Inhuman, and Love and Other Disasters. 

&gt;**Starkill**: I'd recommend Virus of the Mind, I haven't listened to much else, but it's good.

&gt;**The Stranded**: I'd recommend their sole album, Survivalism Boulevard. Both members of Disarmonia Mundi are in this band.

&gt;**Swallow the Sun**: I'd recommend their entire discography.

&gt;**This Cold Life**: I'd recommend Ascent of the Fallen, and Fallacy.

&gt;**Torchbearer**: I'd recommend Death Meditations, as I haven't listened to much else. Contains Christian Alvestam and Satariel vocalist, Par Johansson.

&gt;**Universum**: I'd recommend Leto Destinatus, and Mortuus Machina. Christian Alvestam does guest vocals on a few tracks on Mortuus Machina. Surely you see a trend by now.

&gt;**Wintersun**: I'd recommend Wintersun, and Time I."

Strain nails the growls, but doesn't come anywhere near the quality of Christian's cleans. Christian has power in both the growl and the clean. "
"Scar Symmetry - The Illusionist (Ryan Strain cover w/ New Instrumental)","All things considered, I don't think anybody could really ever come enough to truly matching Christian's vocals. He's truly one in a million.

I think Ryan still does good enough, but my only problem with his previous cover is that it sounded like he was trying too hard to repeat or mimic Christian to the point where the cover he did sounded too similar to the original, except slightly lacking in comparison. With the new instrumentals in this version, it's a better cover because it sounds quite good but can stand on its own compared to the original instead of sounding too similar.

I remembered somebody posting some other band's cover of Scar Symmetry's Morphogenesis on this sub sometime back, and I thought that had the opposite problem. It was a cover that did a good enough job sounding different from the original, but it didn't sound very good (to me at least; I really didn't like that cover)."

"Trying to start a melodic death metal band any advice","Any natural minor or Melodic minor works fine.

Check out At The Gates, In Flames and Be'lakor as they will give you somewhat different takes on melodic death that you can study and use in your songs.

Also Listen to Carcass' Heartwork to get some more ideas

After that you can start mixing it up with other genres

To promote a band from my town, [The Revenge Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmGN2yWMLCo) mix it up with some hardcore and thrash without sounding like Deathcore.

"Symphonic Melodeath?","Hey all,

I have loved expanding my metal horizon thanks to all your posts, hoping you guys can help me out some more.  I love some good doom metal (Swallow the Sun, Ahab) and have enjoyed melodeath with symphonic influence (Dimmu Borgir, Zonaria, Destinity).  While I love symphonic aspect to metal, it is pretty easy to (in my mind) to have too much symphony and overpower the the great things going on within the music.  In short, I'm looking for more bands that have influences of symphonic death metal in their music.  Thank you, my brothers and sisters.

**Who is ready for some At The Gates to come out or what?**"
"Symphonic Melodeath?","[Wintersun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alo7A0NLmxU) has to be the most obvious one.

[Persefone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_LtFlqBtuU) is pretty solid (it might be a bit more on the proggy side then symphonic side though. I gave you an intrumental to judge for yourself)

Eternal Tears of Sorrow (sorry no links, as I don't know them other then by name) and Whispered are also possibilities.

I definitely agree with you on the symphonic side. A little is good, but some overkill is bad. I tend to love the melodeath that uses keyboards, but not as a driver to the music (look at Insomnium - particularly the last 3 albums, in terms of adding atmosphere -, Omnium Gatherum - last 2 here - and Words of Farewell - who nail this concept to a T).

(AND I AM DAMN READY FOR AT THE GATES. Late 2014, at least.)"
"Symphonic Melodeath?","[Kalisia - Cybion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0f_N6nTpmA)

"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","I'm not sure how I feel about this. I'll just have to wait to form an opinion until I hear more."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","Same here. I'm a huge fan of In Flames but this track, I'm not sure if I like it or not "
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","The flow feels really broken and like they just meshed random instrument portions together. I can forgive the voice not sounding like the classic in flames due to Anders fucking up his throat. But the lyrics themselves are disappointing."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","&gt; Anders fucking up his throat

when did this happen?"
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","I actually really like newer In Flames, but this song just seems pretty terrible. First single I don't like from them, that's a bad sign..."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","I hear some SOAPF, but its so..... radio metal."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","instruments sound good. Vocals still are whiny and not In Flames..."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","Other than it being the main singer for In Flames."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","Body snatchers struck after Clayman "
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","I could really grow to like this. That opening riff/solo is great. Getting very keen for this album"
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","Typical mixed feelings reaction. I like it, but I miss the old stuff."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","Does any one else feel like this could have been on SOAPF? My only complaint would be if the album doesn't sound different from the others. Imo each album has been different from the rest in some regard. I like the intro of this song but after the lie awake part is were it sounds familiar."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","I have the exact same opinion, this could totally be a bonus track for SOAPF. Even though I don't really liked the song, my real fear is that In Flames is used to release albums that, as you say, differ from previous ones but are very consistent. SOAPF was not that great but listening to it a few times was enough to get into it, not comparing it to their previous efforts. If they now start to try and please everybody with an album with a few soft, a few heavy, a few old school songs and so on, unless they truly hit the nail (pun intended), they are at risk of a weak album."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","Hear hear. Although, folks with the taste of death metal have not liked the band since clayman, each album was able to tell a new story and differ musically. I have never thought that they had a weak album. Hopefully, I feel the same way in September. So far there is a case why this is weaker than SOAPF. I believe its first single was Deliver Us, which musically was different than most IF. Rusted Nail however starts strong but ends stale..."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","Still with Anders' voice from early 2000's was still availible...

That's the main thing I get with In Flames since SoaPF. I just keep imagining bits as if Anders was still on top of his game, and just feel disappointed."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","You mean the 90s, right? Lol. I think his voice was better in when they were more melodeath than now. "
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","Well, depends. Even if it was just the growls he could pull off in the 2000's (so... post Clayman) would fit the sound better then the 90's stuff (up to and including Colony). Really, anything but whatever he's been trying to pull off..."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","I like everything from Jester Race to SoaPF (reroute being my least fave) but this is the first time I've been truly disappointed. I just hope that the album is better than this. The sound is ok, definitely has some trademark sound to it, but it doesn't seem to have a cohesive idea, it's all over the map. "
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","I have yet to find an In Flames album I hate.. This might be the one.

At least, judging from this song."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","They are definitely pulling influence from a range of things and mixing it in to a weird dish.

I do have mixed feelings about this song because I feel like it doesnt really flow as nicely as others have. But I also felt that way about Behemoths new album and after having it on repeat i started to get really in to it and feel everything about it.

Hopefully that happens with this new album.

Edit: Also this link seems to have a pretty bad rip of the song which i feel is hindering it a bit."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","I can't say I'm a fan of their later stuff either, wouldn't really call it melodic death metal tbh (hell, even metal archives calls it melodic groove metal xD).  I really hope they play their older stuff when I see them in October..."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","Live they very very rarely play pre-clayman and if they do it's usually a single song.

So you'll probably get disappointed if you're expecting old stuff. Last time I saw them they played artifacts of the black rain which was great but apart from only for the weak they play nothing pre 2000's from the 3 times I've seen them before that."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","sadface. I'll still go but I won't be able to mosh to groove metal :/"
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","They're still one of the best bands I've ever seen live though so you don't have to worry much, they've really got the live thing down. Lots of energy in those concerts."
"In Flames - Rusted Nail (2014 - New Song)","I hope this is some kind of joke. This is honestly just bullshit put into an audio track. I didn't hate sounds of a playground fading like most people who love the old school in flames, but it had some substance. This song seems to have been wrote by a 10 year old."
"Flub - Unrequited (NEW SONG) (Amazing tech/melo death)",""
"Flub - Unrequited (NEW SONG) (Amazing tech/melo death)","I really liked the introduction and the melody, but couldn't stand the ""deathcore"" style vocals. :( It's too bad because I was really into it until the vocals came in."

"Mors Principium Est - Departure","Birth of the Starchild is also another great track"
"SCAR SYMMETRY - Cryonic Harvest (OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO)",""
"SCAR SYMMETRY - Cryonic Harvest (OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO)","Musically the song is pretty damn good, but my gods those lyrics... As far as sciency lyrics with a modicum of cogency they should really take a note out of Allegaeon's play book, instead of this incoherent mess of buzzwords that occasionally rhyme. "
"SCAR SYMMETRY - Cryonic Harvest (OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO)","They're making Roberth and Lars sound less goofy with each successive album released. Either that, or I'm past the Christian departure now. I still can't listen to Dark Matter Dimensions though."
"SCAR SYMMETRY - Cryonic Harvest (OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO)","Dark matter has grown on me, however there are a couple really wonky songs on that album."
"SCAR SYMMETRY - Cryonic Harvest (OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO)","well put!"
"SCAR SYMMETRY - Cryonic Harvest (OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO)","Scar Symmetry was my favorite band with Christian, and the last several years have been tough.  However, this is the first Scar album I am looking forward to in 5+ years.  Really loving the sounds of this song."
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","So some melo death varies stylistically depending on the region, namely Swedish (or Gothenburg) which is the ""textbook"" melo death sound, Finnish which sometimes has a more folky or borderline black metal influence, and finally American which tends to have a more ""core"" vibe. So now I want to know what you fine peoples' favorite regional strain of melo death is?"
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","I find myself gravitating towards Finland. Mostly because of Insomnium, Omnium Gatherum, Shade Empire (Not Melo-Death, I know), etc."
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","Looooove Shade Empire!"
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","Finland all the way, but an honourable mention to Australia for the single data point that is Be'lakor!"
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","Don't forget Ne Obliviscarus. They aren't necessarily melo death but they are definitely worth a data point."
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","I will listen to anything that comes out of Scandinavia, especially Sweden."
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","Australia currently. Be'lakor, Ne Obliviscaris and Orpheus are solid bands."
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","I'm all about the classic Gothenburg sound: In Flames, At the Gates, Dark Tranquility."
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","Swedish and Finnish are my two favorites"
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","Sweden for Amon Amarth, Katatonia and Dark Tranquility"
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","Looking through the bands on my Ipod, I've found that I really like the Finnish Melodeath bands like Insomnium, Omnium Gatherum, Noumena, Wolfheart, Before The Dawn, and Swallow the Sun. Australia deserves a mention as well because of Valtari, Orpheus Omega, and the almighty Be'lakor."
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","Sweden and Finland are my favourites, but I prefer Swedish melodeath- In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, At the Gates, Amon Amarth and Scar Symmetry"
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","Sweden is neat because of In Flames, Arch Enemy, and Amaranthe. They're my favorite melodeath bands.

Sonic Syndicate, while not my favorite, raises my rating too."
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","I once took a spring break trip to Finland for the sole purpose of seeing Omnium Gatherum in concert, so I'm going to go with Finland."
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","If we're talking about only melodic death metal, Sweden wins hands down. If we're talking about all kinds of metal, I adore Denmark."
"Favorite type of melo death by region?","Carach Angren, nuff said."

"Insomnium - Shadows of the Dying Sun (full album stream)",""
"Insomnium - Shadows of the Dying Sun (full album stream)","It's an awesome album. But I'm kind of disappointed at the mixing of Ephemeral on the album. The backing guitars and drums are much more muted on the album than they were on the Ephemeral single album they put out."
"Insomnium - Shadows of the Dying Sun (full album stream)","I actually like it, and think it fits the rest of the album much better than the earlier EP version. That one sounded much ""brighter"", and it would have stood out from the sound of the other songs."
"Insomnium - Shadows of the Dying Sun (full album stream)","I made it about half-way through ""The Primeval Dark"" and decided I have to [buy](http://i.imgur.com/pJA1E2w.png) it.  It sounds awesome."
"Insomnium - Shadows of the Dying Sun (full album stream)","when his vocals kick in.. good god, I get goosebumps every time!."
"Insomnium - Shadows of the Dying Sun (full album stream)","I wasn't a fan of theirs til I heard this.  Bought."
"Insomnium - Shadows of the Dying Sun (full album stream)","Favorite songs so far? I seriously cannot decide... As of right now it would have to be a tie between Collapsing Words and Revelations. The entire album is simply amazing. It has been a long time since I enjoyed every song on an album."
"Insomnium - Shadows of the Dying Sun (full album stream)","Well, I have it as Revelations being the best, in a dog fight with Ephemeral. Collapsing Words, Black Heart Rebellion, While We Sleep and The River are up there too (I exclude Primeval Dark, but it is a great piece of it as well).
Insomnium hasn't had an album this consistently strong since Above a Weeping World (imo). Only weakness here is that I'm not a super fan of Lose to Night, but otherwise I put it on par (we'll see if this one has the same lasting power) with AaWW (my current favorite album period.). It's a huge grower album though."
"Insomnium - Shadows of the Dying Sun (full album stream)","Insomnium has a special place in my heart ‚ô•"
"Insomnium - Shadows of the Dying Sun (full album stream)","I pre-ordered the special edition (cause Insomnium), still not blown away like I've been with their other albums. Still good, possibly great, not fantastic."

"I'm Excited, are you? (At The Gates uploaded this 4 hours ago)","I'm awfully curious to see if they'll pull a Carcass and actually pull through and match their previous efforts. Slaughter of the Soul is almost considered a legendary landmark of the genre and it you're going to take the shine of ""Last album they ever made"" off of it, it's going to have to at the least stand on it's own.

I think they can, but who knows, really."

"The Duskfall new track released ""where the tree stands dead""","Yes new singer, the old guy didn't want to rejoin the band when they got back together. Honestly I agree with you he's trying to be Anders. But I think he does a better job at sounding like Anders than Anders has in the passed 3 or 4 In Flames' albums.

"Soilwork - Distance (second cover by Ryan Strain) + Raw Vocals","If you take a look at the description of the video, besides thinking that his voice got better, Ryan decided to do this cover again because his video was slowly blocked all over the world before eventually being blocked even within the United States, despite how Soilwork and Bjorn Strid shared the video themselves.

Just to make sure that it keeps going around, there's a Mediafire link in the description so you can download and reupload it should it ever be blocked again."

"Anyone have suggestions for melodeath bands that do not use synth?","Sweet list you got there, but don't Insomnium use a lot of synth, actually?"
"Anyone have suggestions for melodeath bands that do not use synth?","Not really, they don't have a dedicated keyboard player. All melodic parts are done with guitars and bass. Maybe on the newer albums they do have synth parts in studio, but you listen to their debut and sophomore albums, they aren't using any synths, except in intros to some songs to create a sense of foreboding."
"Anyone have suggestions for melodeath bands that do not use synth?","Ah okay, well no dedicated keyboard player, yes but last time I saw them tgey did make use if a lot of recorded synth backing tracks. Not that there's anything wrong with that. "

Unless they want clean vocals, then they get Disarmonia Mundi. "

It's a funny feeling when everything ties together in this sort of confusing, unexpected way."

"Devildriver going on hiatus. Jeff Kendrick and John Boecklin have left the band","Devildriver is typically known as more a Groove Metal band, but that sub has like 6 posts, so it seemed better putting this in MDM as they also cross into that genre.

Dez posted on the band's Facebook page that Jeff and John have parted ways with Devildriver and the band is going on hiatus while Dez ""rejoins"" Coal Chamber /r/NuMetal to put out a new album and do a tour cycle. He also said that Devildriver is NOT done and will return with a new album in 2016. I sure hope that's true and Devildriver doesn't just fade away!"
"Devildriver going on hiatus. Jeff Kendrick and John Boecklin have left the band","Damn. I feel that they peaked a long time ago, but I still woudn't want to see them break up. "
"Devildriver going on hiatus. Jeff Kendrick and John Boecklin have left the band","Yeah I think Fury of Our Maker's Hand and Last Kind Words were their best material. I still like the newer albums, but it seems like it lost some of it's edge from the earlier ones. Either way, Dez seems like an awesome guy and has to be one of the hardest working guys in metal, so I hope it's true that they come back in '16."
"Devildriver going on hiatus. Jeff Kendrick and John Boecklin have left the band","Personally I loved their first album the most. I Dreamed I died and Cry For Me Sky are two of my most played songs."
"Devildriver going on hiatus. Jeff Kendrick and John Boecklin have left the band","Both great tunes. I love their grindier stuff like Grinfucked and Digging Up The Corpses."
"Devildriver going on hiatus. Jeff Kendrick and John Boecklin have left the band","I like Devildriver, but if any band could use a hiatus, it's them.  They've been on cruise control for a few albums now.  If a break can breathe some fresh air into them, great.  I wish more bands would take some time off instead of just cranking out the albums every 2 years and then touring for a year each time.  They get stale, fast."
"Devildriver going on hiatus. Jeff Kendrick and John Boecklin have left the band","Feels like a break could do them some good. The last 2 albums haven't really been up to par with their earlier works. But DevilDriver is one of the best live bands I've seen, incredible energy and stage presence; would hate to see them disappear."
"Devildriver going on hiatus. Jeff Kendrick and John Boecklin have left the band","Agreed. They have an amazing stage presence and incredible energy during live shows! It's one of the things that makes me love the band. 

A lot of times, Dez is referred to as 'the hardest working guy in metal', which may have caught up to him, the band and the music. With an album cycle every 1-1/2 to 2 years and seemingly on the road all the time, maybe this is a well deserved break to regroup."

"Insomnium - Out To The Sea [Bonus song - SOTDS]",""
"Insomnium - Out To The Sea [Bonus song - SOTDS]","What is it with melodeath bands and releasing some of the greater tracks as a bonus these days? Words of Farewell had a a great one with ""Overture"", DT with ""Immemorial"" (beat all of Construct hands down if you ask me) and now this?

Not complaining, because this is great."
"Insomnium - Out To The Sea [Bonus song - SOTDS]","Its something the label/publishers make them do and 9/10 times its called Japanese bonus tracks, not sure what's with that. This however is from Disk 2, it has 4 songs. The others are the instrumental released with Ephemeral EP."
"Insomnium - Out To The Sea [Bonus song - SOTDS]","As long as they don't do another ""Into the Evernight"" like on Across the Dark (basically, ""At The Gates of Sleep"" from Above a Weeping World with a different title), I'm fine. As long as it keeps being awesome, I'm fine.

Mildly annoyed that I'll have to switch disks when I put this in the car on a drive, or I'll have to burn another CD with all of them on it. Didn't know that this was mostly the label's decision, though."
"Insomnium - Out To The Sea [Bonus song - SOTDS]","This song sounds more like a spiritual successor to change of heart. The Intro sounds pretty similar to change of heart, which doesn't surprise me because this song was written by Markus Vanhala, the new guitarist and His fav insomnium album of all time is Above the weeping world."
"Insomnium - Out To The Sea [Bonus song - SOTDS]","For some reason I thought it was Nillo + Ville, but you're right, OttS is Markus + Ville. Markus wrote Promethean Song, Revelations, part of this and part of The River (with Nillo). Can't remember what other song Nillo worked on then :/ (If I were to guess, Black Heart Rebellion though. Just sounds like his stuff - shame he doesn't write as much these days and it's mostly Friman, but adding Vanhala is a great thing).

(Oh, and I agree with him on Above a Weeping World. It's my all-time favorite of anything, not just Insomnium)"

"SCAR SYMMETRY - The Singularity (Phase I - Neohumanity) FULL ALBUM!","I'm glad you enjoyed it. I've loved everything they've done - even the albums after Christian left. But this just fell flat for me. Bad lyric writing, terrible clean vocals on most songs (there are a couple exceptions), and mostly forgettable besides their single. The best part was Per's guitar work....which I expected to be great.

I liked the last two songs on the album the best. So I didn't hate the album, I guess. Just disappointed."

Be real with them and help them until it sounds good. They do sound like they have potential though. Also, the drumming could use a little more variation.

He does have two other bands that he's frontman for, though, and both are very good. They're called Solution .45 and The Few Against Many."

"Scar Symmetry- The Consciousness Eaters","It's not like it on all tracks but this one in particular is a good example as to why I dislike the new singers. There's so much unnecessary effects and weird techniques used in here. Like between 0:25 and 0:33. Are those weird cleans really necessary?

Even though old scar symmetry did weird stuff here and there it just feels like they take it over the top way too often when Christian left.

"Ghost Brigade- Chamber","While Ghost Brigade isn't really melodic death (can't recall this song off the top of my head, because it's not off the amazing *Isolation Songs*), it usually has some stylings that make it good to people who like the stuff (particularly if you like Insomnium and that style of more atmospheric, thoughtful melodic death).

Sons of Aeon (side-project of some Ghost Brigade members) fit the melodic death bill more but keep a similar sound, so take a look :P"
"Ghost Brigade- Chamber","I actually listen to Sons of Aeon already and really like them. 

You are right about them not being melodeath though. Metal archives classifies them as Melodic death/ doom metal. I thought that the folks over here would like it though because of the melodeath elements that these guys have. "
"Ghost Brigade- Chamber","They may not be melodeath, but they still rock. I agree with your thought that people here would like it."
"Ghost Brigade- Chamber","They fall under Post-metal / Prog-metal according to [here](http://www.metalstorm.net/bands/band.php?band_id=3288&amp;bandname=Ghost%2BBrigade). Which works more imo. But they do have a sound that can be familiar to melodeath guys, especially Insomnium fans (since Aleksi Munter worked with both bands on their albums on keyboards, the sound is very similar when you pay attention)."

"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","My taste in music has really developed over the years. As a kid I didn't listen to music often, but if I did it was generally something by Eminem or related rap acts. A friend of mine then introduced me into the rap/rock combo known as Linkin Park, after which I moved on to gothic rock bands like Within Temptation and Evanescence. Then came Alter Bridge, which was my first hard rock/metal act (and still one of my favorites this day), before my taste broadened to ""anything involving guitar and clean vocals"", the instrument I picked up myself about four years ago. Since about six years ago I listen to music pretty much whenever I'm able to. 

Recently I was looking into new tracks to learn on guitar, when I ran into Insomnium. Now before this I only listened to stuff with clean vocals, but something about Insomnium just made it click. 

The last couple of weeks I've been listening Insomnium's Across The Dark, Since The Day It All Came Down and One for Sorrow albums almost exclusively (start to finish, not random). Especially [Unsung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns9_A3CKqPM) just grabs me and pulls me in. [Just look at this a screencap from my Last.FM.](http://i.imgur.com/wDczbSz.png) I still have to listen to their other albums, but I'll get to them soon enough.  

So that's my story of how I got into MeloDeath. Hope it wasn't too long!"
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","You're going to be in for a huge grin once you get to Above a Weeping World and Shadows of a Dying Sun."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","Every single album has blown my mind in some way if not multiple ways."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","Everyone of them is worth checking out, and while some have lost their shine after a dozen listens (to me that's In The Halls of Awaiting and One for Sorrow) for me, those two I don't think I'll ever bore of. So consistent and amazing - Mortal Share I've listened to thousands of times and still love it just as much as the first few listens. There isn't a single bad track on AaWW, and the same goes for Shadows, although I'm not a huge fan of the last 2 tracks, but the rest of the album (for the most part - including the bonus track) is just so spectacular."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","The mixing for one for sorrow was all over the place. ATWW is hands down one of their best work. 

My all time fav song by insomnium is *song of the forlorn son*, the fucking outro is out of this world!"
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","That song is part of the Exhibit A to why I call Insomnium ""The Kings of the Outro"".

Ridiculous."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","I knew why something seemed off, it's Above THE Weeping World.  I kept looking at your guys' comments and was confused.  Just FYI.  :)"
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","Well shit. "
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","I have listened Above a Weeping World a few times, and I definitely enjoy The Killjoy from it. It just sounds so... *victorious* would best describe it for me. 

I don't quite know the rest of the tracks by name yet but I did listen to the album a handful of times without skipping tracks. It's definitely a keeper."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","You're going to be stoked when you hear Be'lakor."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","Hell yeah, Insomnium and Be'lakor are my 2 favourites. I actually might slightly prefer the latter, so good! "
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","I wanted to tell him that too. :)"
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","Haha I love them as well. I kind of discovered them together with Fractal Gates."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","Their newest album, Shadows of the Dying Sun is goddamned phenomenal."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","The best parts are the parts that aren't metal to me. the acoustic part at the end of While We Sleep is damn beautiful"
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","The guitar solos just make me stop what I'm doing and air guitar along, *every single time*."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","Vanhala's a fitting name for the guy, isn't it?"
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","Not a single unlikeable song in that one. And I hadn't listened to Insomnium at all before that album.

There's something very appealing in the whole dreamy but bleak theme the album has. The songs are like lullabies. Lullabies for a dying sun. It's quite lovely."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","I'll listen to that one next! Will probably be somewhere this afternoon."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","[Fuck yeah.](http://i.imgur.com/stUcAqd.jpg)"
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","I bought their necklace from the webshop and got a flag, poster, signed postcard and lanyard for free. Best damn day of my life."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","You'll probably like Omnium Gatherum and Be'lakor"
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","Cool story bro. Really. I was slowly drawn in through Rap Rock and Nu Metal lol. Also was a guitar player at the time. Korn, the Deftones, Static-X, and the like slowly turned into Industrial music like Fear Factory and then into Metal Core like As I Lay Dying and Trivium and then I found Soilwork, Disarmonia Mundi, In Flames, Dark Tranquility, Mnemic, Insomnium and Omnium Gatherum all on a compilation album (The best of melodic death metal volume 5) and the rest is history. That musical journey probably took me like 5 years or so to complete. I remember being a Deftones fanatic in High School and the one who showed me that compilation album was a college buddy.

Guitar and drum work is what really drew me in, constantly searching for that tingly feeling down my spine that only the best music could produce.

Insomnium is my favorite band now. Omnium Gatherum a very close second. I love it all though.

If you have any questions let us know."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","&gt; Guitar and drum work is what really drew me in.

Right on. Insomnium has some incredible riffs in a style I haven't heard before. The rhythmic way they play guitar and the amount of pull-offs back to the open string (Like the intro of Through The Shadows or The New Beginning) they do is something I hadn't heard before. 

Will definitely check out Omnium Gatherum if they're a close second to Insomnium!"
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","For OG I'd recommend to start with The Redshift (kind of an intro to their new style) then New World Shadows (it's my 2nd best album of all time behind Insomnium's ""Above a Weeping World"") and Beyond. Thing to know is that Insomnium swapped guitarists for their 6th album (Shadows of a Dying Sun) and ended up getting the lead from Omnium Gatherum - which once you listen to that list you'll notice is amazing.

So yeah, they're pretty close, but the albums from OG earlier then Redshift are fairly different. Not that you shouldn't check them out, but I'd look at them after looking at the masterpieces (NWS and Beyond)."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","One of my favorites of Omnium Gatherum is Formidable:

"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","They now share a guitarist actually. IIRC the one from Insomnium was also a Neural Surgeon and that was way more important."

Haven't listened to their latest album yet, but the others are great."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","Welcome aboard.  Melodic Death is the easiest of the harsher sub genres to get into.  It's what I was most into back in 2003 when I first started to listen to metal and it's pretty much the same now too.  Most likely you will venture into more heavier genres.  If you like Insomnium, you should check out their old side project Watch Me Fall."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","&gt;  If you like Insomnium, you should check out their old side project Watch Me Fall.

Will do.

I've listened to ""regular"" metal (I feel dirty for calling it that) for years now, but haven't explored much of the subs yet. Until now it was usually Alter Bridge, Tremonti, Avenged Sevenfold, Amorphis, Disturbed, Kamelot, SoaD, Slipknot, Escape the Fate, and Van Canto.  
Will definitely keep expanding my list. "
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","Yeah, Amorphis are pretty awesome.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kQBTwygtKQ This is the lead track on the Watch Me Fall album, it's awesome."

Pandora gave me a song by Insomnium called Black Waters and i've been hooked on MeloDeath ever since. "
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","I do know a couple of Ensiferum songs because I started learning them on guitar. I haven't gotten to listening full albums yet, though.

Some songs I like/play are Burning Leaves, Old Man and Little Dreamer."
"Recently got into MeloDeath, absolutely fallen in love with Insomnium.","Oooh take a listen to Sword Chant. Definitely a fun one for guitar due to tasty licks and interesting pacing. Token of Time, Battle song, and Windrider are my other favs. Old Man/Little Dreamer is good too. If it's not too much, check out Falconer if you don't know them already. Wings of Serenity or Mindtraveller are good ones to start on. 

I'll stop now. Rock on!"

"Your melodeath gateway band?","Amon Amarth and In Flames were my gateway bands, a friend gave me a few songs."
"Your melodeath gateway band?","Amon Amarth is a gateway band into all kinds of music. And fucking great to listen to. Every time I listen to Twilight of the Thunder God I want to grow my beard out further, braid it, and pillage the English countyside. "
"Your melodeath gateway band?","Children of Bodom. A buddy of mine burned me a double CD of ""Follow the Reaper"" and ""Hate Crew Deathroll."" InFlames was the second. "

Fuck I'm old."
"Your melodeath gateway band?","I got into In Flames and Soilwork both simultaneously around the Reroute to Remain/Figure Number Five era. 

Once I got into them I went backwards in their catalogs and fell in love with their old material, which led me to other stuff like At the Gates, Dark Tranqullity, etc.

Before then I had only listened to metalcore bands like KSE/Shadows Fall and the like, and nu metal before that."
"Your melodeath gateway band?","Ctrl+V, Ctrl+P

KSE used to be a fav of mine. Listened to them recently, holy fuck is that shit bland."
"Your melodeath gateway band?","Really? I love their new album. I fucking love melodeath, but sometimes a good metalcore jam is much needed. I'm probably going to get crucified for admitting that haha."
"Your melodeath gateway band?","Don't let assholes make you feel bad for liking a type of music.  I don't understand people who feel that a metalhead can like melodeath, black, folk, but isn't allowed to like metalcore.  There is plenty of good metalcore."
"Your melodeath gateway band?","Heh, well you can listen to whatever you please. If that's what you like then good for you. Don't let other people make you feel bad for liking the thing you like, after all there is nothing more subjective and down to personal tastes than music."

I didn't really start to get into the genre until my freshmen year of college when I started to listen to Soilwork. Even then I was mainly listening to metalcore bands like Killswitch Engage, Avenged Sevenfold, and Atreyu. I ditched those bands about a year ago though, and have been listening to melodeath ever since.

"
"Your melodeath gateway band?","In Flames - Clayman, Kalmah - Swamplord

"
"Your melodeath gateway band?","If you can count it as one - you probably can't - it would be Amaranthe.

Yeah, didn't think so. Anyway, the real answer would be *Eluveitie*, I suppose. Death metal-folk metal hybrid, that one. *Thousandfold*, while painful to listen to at first, got quite tolerable very quickly. That was my gateway.

I decided to keep listening to their stuff despite the initial discomfort because I reasoned I need to increase my metal tolerance, or I'll be stuck listening to the same five bands forever. It wasn't a bad decision. I can listen to some really good shit now that I can tolerate the growls."

"Your melodeath gateway band?","Exactly the same! We're Only-for-the-Weak-buddies!"
"Your melodeath gateway band?","The heaviest music I listened to at the time was probably All That Remains. Anyway, I got The Darkness, a horror action game on the 360 and loved the shit out of it. During said game, you encounter TVs with a tonne of stuff on them, including The Duskfall's Shoot It In.

I fucking loved that song. Every time I went by one, I'd hit up the music channel and wait for that song to finish. I looked up the band and found they had four albums out. Being the unemployed 17 year old I was living in New Zealand where it was impossible to even buy the albums if I wanted to, I downloaded them. Loved the shit out of that band. A few months passed and I had a job, so I was able to scour the internet until I found a place that had them in stock and shipped them to New Zealand. When the CDs had arrived and I nearly destroyed my ears listening to them, I decided to look the band up to see what they were doing. Touring, making a new album, etc. 

The band had split up two weeks before I got the CDs. I've been listening to them ever since and until I found this sub, I discovered that they have reunited (Although I can't find much info in English) and are working on a new album. I cannot wait."

"Your melodeath gateway band?","I used to be strictly into Metallica and Megadeth. I hated music with screaming or growly vocals. But i remember a friend of a friend left a burnt CD with various metal songs on it at my house. Most of it was Metallica, Type O Negative, Stone Sour type music on it. But it had this one song on it that was really melodic and had some amazing keyboard parts in it as well. But it also had the screaming vocals as well, so I was confused to if I really liked it or not. But the more I listened to it, the more that it grew on me. After a weeks worth of listening to that song, I was hooked, but i had no idea who it was still. Flash forward a couple weeks later, I'm watching Uranium and low and behold that song comes on and it says that it's from some band called Soilwork.  I've been a melo death fan ever since."

After Norther came In Flames, Soilwork and Dark Tranquillity who since then have been accompanied by a whole lot of other bands.

"Your melodeath gateway band?","Amon Amarth, as most here, and their tune Valhall Awaits. "
"Your melodeath gateway band?","Honestly shadows fall was the first band that got me into modern metal. I had always been a fan of shit like black sabbath and metallica, but hadn't really got into more modern metal. From there I found shit like trivium and then started looking into foreign bands.

"Your melodeath gateway band?","Amon Amarth, guardians of asgaard. Children of Bodom, bodom after midnight. There are probably more that made me go ""holy shit what is this magic I'm listening to!?"""
"Your melodeath gateway band?","Scar Symmetry show me the way, and Soilwork opened the door. Those are still my two favorite melodeath bands"
"Your melodeath gateway band?","Children of Bodom and Amon Amarth. The first melo-death song I heard was Downfall by CoB and I was immediately in love with the melodies, but the vocals took some getting used to. As for Amon Amarth, I much preferred their vocal style over CoB's but they weren't as technical instrumentally but they had some killed riffs and the first song I heard by them was Pursuit of Vikings.

Those two bands basically got me into all types of metal more extreme than Thrash. From there I discovered some of my favorite bands today like Kalmah, Dark Tranquillity, Insomnium, Wintersun, Eluveitie, and The Absence

"Your melodeath gateway band?","Definitely Amon Amarth"

I like bands like In Flames, Dark Tranquility, At the Gates, Soilwork, Insomnium, Children of Bodom, Kalmah, Scar Symmetry, Sonic Syndicate etc. as much as the next person, but unless it's a new song or news related to mainstream bands that are usually the gateway into melodic death metal, i really don't want to see At The Gates - Blinded by Fear or In Flames - Jester Race (full album stream) and other popular songs from the prime era of various bands to be posted and upvoted repeatedly by the community.  "

"How would you improve /r/melodicdeathmetal?","###FLAIRS

What kind of flairs? For a start 'we' can implement instruments, later on we can try to implement band's logos. This will be tricky i suppose since it needs to be cropped but still needs to be visible to the eye and know which goddamn logo it is. And implementing every goddamn MDM band is simply impossible. So if any1 has the skills and most important the time to make them it would be great.

further more adding a flair, and filling it in by urself is something that's much easier to do and kinda brings the same effect"

"Jari writes about album releases and Nuclear Blast slowing down Wintersun",""
"Jari writes about album releases and Nuclear Blast slowing down Wintersun","I'm going to get crucified for saying this but here it goes: Winter Sun/Jari dropped the ball on the last album and Nuclear Blast couldn't save it.

I know, that is an insanely unpopular opinion among fans, lets just call me a penguin.

It would be easier to make that assertion had I not been the most die hard fan that ever was (ok, slight exaggeration but not that much) and it took a month or more to admit it to myself- ""Time I just isn't a great album"".

Put the pitchforks down, I'll explain how I came to this conclusion and like anything else, this is totally subjective. ""Wintersun"" was a fucking mind blowing album, nay- *Experience*. It changed music for me in a fundamental way. I was no longer willing to accept blast beats and fast guitars in any form, Jari had exposed me to actual skilled musicianship, there was no turning back.

Fast forward almost a decade. Other bands have come and gone, tastes have become more sophisticated. ""Time I"" is coming up for release and everyone I know is getting excited for it. The launch day hits and we're all so goddamn ready for a sonic assault its starting to cause palpitations.

I remember my very first impression- ""Ok, long intro, he gets to do that, this album deserves it."" My second impression was- ""Hmmm, that lick sounds familiar, so does that one."" after 9 minutes I was thoroughly underwhelmed, this was a rehash of the same material! It wasn't ""similar sounding"" like any good band will pull off, it was whole licks stolen from the previous album! I was furious.

Ok, ok, if the album had been released in 2007 when it should have been it wouldn't have been a big deal but it had been 10 years! You gotta pull out some new tricks or scrap it and start again (I'm aware that had already happened but it happened in 2005 not 2011).

""Time I"" wasn't just a disappointment, it hurt my feelings. Everything that made Wintersun great had been stripped away and we were left with an opera of the first album, slightly toned down and longer.

I understand if I'm the only one in this sub that felt this way, there was even disagreement between my musical peer group about it. We were essentially split down the middle and a few drunken debates became borderline violent.

I didn't mean to offend anyone's music taste with this post, it was mostly to get my own frustration out. The feeling I am left with is similar to waiting for X-mas for 10 years and when it finally comes it turns out my gifts were just my own old toys wrapped in new paper."
"Jari writes about album releases and Nuclear Blast slowing down Wintersun","I'm mostly into the first album, too.. but if Time II was to be funded by the fans I (and most sane people) would think it's wrong that Nuclear Blast takes most of the money. ¬®

The point is that most record labels are shit, they abuse their power as much as they possibly can. "
"Jari writes about album releases and Nuclear Blast slowing down Wintersun","I totally agree that labels eat up all the profit and then complain they lost money and I don't think he should work with NB anymore.

I don't disagree with Jari's position on the label making things more difficult, but I don't think they wrote the tunes and that ultimately was the cause of this album's lackluster performance.

Shit, it didn't do well in Finland, that had to be a rough blow to his ego."
"Jari writes about album releases and Nuclear Blast slowing down Wintersun","I prefer the first album too, but I still loved Time I. I, however, do not feel right about judging it before I have heard both parts, as it is/was supposed to be a whole album."
"Jari writes about album releases and Nuclear Blast slowing down Wintersun","[deleted]"
"Jari writes about album releases and Nuclear Blast slowing down Wintersun","I think that is a very reasonable argument/opinion. I personally thought Time I was mind blowing but maybe that was a part of me hoping it would be since it took him almost a decade to get it to us."

"In Vain - Image of Time",""
"In Vain - Image of Time","I thought it was more like progressive death metal but whatever, they deserve more attention"
"In Vain - Image of Time","With the atmosphere they create and some of the passages they go through, this is definitely not just death metal."
"In Vain - Image of Time","Riffs are not melodic and lots of non MDM elements caused me to put them in another category. But they are still good."
"In Vain - Image of Time","I wouldnt call it MDM for sure, its more black metal with some of its arrangements and overall tone. But it does have some very MDM passages, even though they are brief."

I'm fucking 33 now. I never thought I'd get the opportunity to hear a NEW at the gates album. This album could be a pile of horseshit and I'd still buy that shit. The fact that it sounds pretty good so far from what I've heard is a cherry on top. "

"Wrote this little start. Thoughts?","It's hard to get a feel for the way things should sound with midi. When a my guitarist would send me stuff I never wanted to give him a real answer of what I thought because I just don't know till the guitar is playing it.

That being said it sounded like it could be real neat."
"Wrote this little start. Thoughts?","This is like if a painter handed you a pencil sketch and asked what you thought of their pastels. This is way too premature, and probably shouldn't ever be heard outside of yourself and your band.

"Dark Tranquillity - The Mundane and the Magic","I saw them in New York earlier in the month. You will not be disappointed."
"Dark Tranquillity - The Mundane and the Magic","I was there too. Oh man they fucking slayed. I was skeptical about the lack of a bassist, but I'm glad they didn't just play the track through the speakers and had someone off stage playing. My favorite part was when Stanne heard the request for Focus Shift in the crowd and changed the set list/moved the song further up, I've never seen that happen. 

I only wished Insomnium had more stage time. I feel like their set ended just as they got their legs under them. "
"Dark Tranquillity - The Mundane and the Magic","Agreed. Insomnium is too badass to have that little stage time. I feel that Winter Nights took up a little too much stage time, though."
"Dark Tranquillity - The Mundane and the Magic","Yea I didn't like Winter Nights at all. Their music was okay, but their vocalist was pretty bad and they were listless on stage. "

"Bands like...","I'm relatively new to MeloDeath, and need some new bands to listen to. Lately, I've been listening to:

-Insomnium

-Heaven Shall Burn

"
"Bands like...","I would give Be'lakor, and Omnium Gatherum a listen if you like Insomnium. I don't really like OG's early albums because of the vocalists singing style. Their most recent stuff is phenomenal, however. All three of Be'lakors albums are incredible, though. Their one of those bands where you have to dedicate a good hour just listening to them, because they have so many songs that run over 6 minutes."
"Bands like...","Be'lakor and Omnium Gatherum. Exactly what I thought of when I read OPs post."
"Bands like...","Be'Lakor (All 3 albums), Omnium Gatherum (particularly New World Shadows, Beyond and The Redshift a tiny bit) and Insomnium basically go hand in hand, in my books.

I'd say it's worth looking at Words of Farewell (both albums) and Dark Tranquillity too (I'd say the big 4 are Gallery, Damage Done, Character and Fiction for DT). WoF offer a very similar kind of atmospheric focus (similar to OG and Insomnium).

EDIT : I should add... feel free to PM/Ask if you want more suggestions"
"Bands like...","Hell yeah words of farewell and DT are another two incredible bands"
"Bands like...","Give eternal tears of sorrow a go. Their sound changes across albums a bit though, I'm partial to the recent most 2 or 3. 

Wintersun. Perfection right there 

Kalisia. Only one album but it's fantastic 

Whispered. Great melodeath with heavy Asian elements 

I've been on a Kalmah, arch enemy, and skyfire kick lately as well. 

Edit. Whispered has heavy Asian elements not again elements... "
"Bands like...","Oh lawdy, I love me some Wintersun. They're not my go-to folk band (that'd be Eluveitie), but it's good stuff.

Queued up albums from the rest. Thanks!"
"Bands like...","At The Gates is essential :)
"
"Bands like...","In Flames and Dark Tranquility were what got me into MeloDeath."
"Bands like...","You could also try Noumena, anatomy of life and absence are good."
"Bands like...","Mercenary is a lot like heaven shall burn. Arch Enemy is also an amazing melodeath band. Their older stuff is much better though. Kataklysm as well actually."

"Oh my god. Insomnium just played!","Caught your set as well, good stuff.  


The band before you though (Didn't catch their name), when the singer tried to have the crowd fill in for some of their vocals that was brutally awkward.  Felt kinda bad when it was dead silent :("
"Oh my god. Insomnium just played!","Lol, I think you're referring to us actually XD yea, it didn't work as well as I had hoped. The band after us was withering  Soul"
"Oh my god. Insomnium just played!","Haha oh fuck, well foot in mouth on my part, didn't realize there was 3 openers (got there late due to work) Either way, your set was good as well minus that minor part :P "
"Oh my god. Insomnium just played!","Thanks! I wanted to try announcing what I wanted people to say before the silence of that song (The Reaper Cometh it's called), as opposed to before the song itself, but as I said, didn't work well. Oh well, ya learn :P"
"Oh my god. Insomnium just played!","I had the same reaction. I'd always known about them, and I'd had Above The Weeping World for a good long time before seeing them, but nothing could have prepared me for how insanely melodic and beautiful their leads and all were."

"One of the best melodeath songs I've heard all year. Fallujah - Sapphire",""
"One of the best melodeath songs I've heard all year. Fallujah - Sapphire","More prog death then melo death, but it's a common confusion (probably because a lot of the bigger melodeath names take inspiration from Edge of Sanity and Opeth, that are prog death but have a similar sound to melo death, so their influence spreads). That said, it's a genre that can be appreciated by the heavier melodeath listeners (as I am).

Also arguably tech because those drums sound like tech stuff.

Other then that it's actually a ~~really solid~~ great song."
"One of the best melodeath songs I've heard all year. Fallujah - Sapphire","I think Melo death could (should?) be considered a blanket genre. For instance the Finnish style MDM (CoB, Norther, MPE) has a lot of power metal influences and a different vocal style, while Gothenborg MDM is more influenced by NWoBHM and old school DM.

When you go a bit more to the edges, where the lines become blurrier, a lot of Folk-metal bands (e.g. Ensiferum, Equilibrium, Eluveitie) could also fall under the monniker MDM. The same for some progmetal bands like Persefone and Kalisia.
"
"One of the best melodeath songs I've heard all year. Fallujah - Sapphire","I agree that it covers a wide range of stuff, but there are differences between progressive (which this song is, for example, or Opeth or Ne Obliviscaris) and the melodic death's (In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, At The Gates). Those differences are fairly nuanced and have lost their ""definitive line"" over time, however. For example, some stuff that is metalcore can be considered by some as melodeath. There's a difference between the two that is obvious to those who know where to look (listen?).

One could say that CoB, MPE and Norther belong to ""extreme power"" (referring to the power metal influences and the extreme vocal style) rather then melodic death, for example. Eluveitie is more or less MDM with folk elements (they sound so similar to Dark Tranquillity in too many places) while I can't vouch for the other 2 (don't listen to them). For Persefone - at least Spiritual Migration - it is close to both, but I would still define that album as a prog death album (but it's close).

In this particular song though, it's very tech-y and proggy to the point where it's that with some atmosphere. That's not what is going to make it melodic death. A lot of prog death can be awfully close sounding to melodeath too (Opeth's ""My Arms Your Hearse"" album, Edge of Sanity's ""Crismon"" are the main examples), due to them having such an influence on the genre as a whole.

I mean - good music is good music - don't get me wrong. I like the melodeath, progdeath, doom, death among others, but I also know some of those don't necessarily belong here rather then in another sub."
"One of the best melodeath songs I've heard all year. Fallujah - Sapphire","This is one of my favorites on the album.  The solos on this album are all so mindblowing."
"One of the best melodeath songs I've heard all year. Fallujah - Sapphire","The ambience and technical melodies blew me away when i first heard this. I'd never liked tech death before this song."

"Arch Enemy - Bury Me An Angel","I won't lie I much prefer Johan Liiva's vocals to those of Angela Gossow. Sure he sounds more like L.G. Petrov on Wolverine Blues with more of a hardcorish shout but over the next few albums his vocals got better. Also the music just felt more memorable on those first releases!"
"Arch Enemy - Bury Me An Angel","I had no idea Arch Enemy was this good before Angela. Looks like another discography I'll be listening to "
"Arch Enemy - Bury Me An Angel","Yeah I was kind of surprised to see so few posts about the era with their first vocalist when I did a search on here. I guess they got far more popular after he left though but some of the comments on the video are pretty funny. A lot of current fans don't seem to be aware there was even a vocalist or albums before Angela joined the band."

"Arch Enemy - Bury Me An Angel","I got into AE when Wages of Sin was released (first metal concert) and I absolutely loved their previous work. I thought Angela was a better vocalist but I didn't really like the direction that their music went in after that album. "

"Ne Obliviscaris - Curator [2014]","I see you got downvoted for knowing your shit...

Atmospheric prog death is probablt more apt, but yes, not melodeath.

A lot of stuff can sound similar to melodeath without being melodeath these days. It's a common confusion with progdeath (thank Edge of Sanity and Opeth for their influence here) and metalcore in particular."
"Ne Obliviscaris - Curator [2014]","It may be a more accurate description of the band, but I think it's fair to say that they are a death metal band that have some melodic portions.  Their music appeals to people in this subreddit, so I appreciate seeing them linked here."
"Ne Obliviscaris - Curator [2014]","&gt;  it's fair to say that they are a death metal band that have some melodic portions. Their music appeals to people in this subreddit, so I appreciate seeing them linked here.

That is true, and I have no problem with people posting in here stuff that can appeal to the typical melodeath fan while not being in itself melodeath (I mean, we all listen to different stuff, right? I, for example, have been hooked on - in the past month - Woods of Ypres' ""Woods 5 : (...)"", Epica's latest, ""The Quantum Enigma"", and most recently Death's ""Symbolic""). Although I feel that should be tagged in the title somewhere, just to avoid some confusions.

"As Be'lakor got brought up in the Insomnium thread, one of my favourites - Fraught","I think I saw on their Facebook they're getting stuck into doing a 4th.

Am I alone in having very little idea what the lyrics are for most death metal?"
"As Be'lakor got brought up in the Insomnium thread, one of my favourites - Fraught","I know they're currently in the studio for a 4th, but when you have bands like Insomnium (6 now) and Dark Tranquillity (a lot) that are at the head of the genre, only having 3 albums makes you want more ;P

Be'Lakor do no wrong in song writing - although some songs are more grow-y then others - so I just want some more, although I understand that song writing at such a high level consistently will take time to make it jive just right.

Depending on the band I can make about half (note : listening to this stuff for about 5 years now) to most of the lyrics from most death metal these days, but some make it real hard, but that's just the nature of all the distortion that goes into making those tones.

However - especially with Insomnium and Be'Lakor - they are most definitely worth googling to read. You gain a whole other level of appreciation. In fact, I only know this part (~ 3:30-4 min mark of this song) because I googled it, loved it so much, and practiced it for a while ;P"

"Shade Empire - Omega Arcane (Full Album)","To me, this band sounds like a happy combination of Two Steps from Hell, Septic Flesh, and Dethklok. But I can also see similar styles in Ne Obliviscaris. All amazing in their own right, but Shade Empire seems to take key elements from each of those bands and make something completely unique, yet recognizable.

"Amon Amarth have started working on album No. 10","I thought they last album had a noticeable change in style. They were definitely going for a more classic metal sound. I wonder if they will continue that trend."
"Amon Amarth have started working on album No. 10","Eh like you said, I'm sure we'll all enjoy it.  Can't complain about a band producing quality melodic death metal.  I loved Surtur Rising, everything about that album kicks ass.  DOTG was kind of meh, but I mean a lot of the songs are still really catchy and you can headbang to em or play drums or guitar to them from time to time.  Great live album as well.  


I'd be fucking thrilled to see a return to the style of ""Once sent from the Golden Hall"" or ""sorrow throughout the nine worlds"", but I doubt that will ever happen.

I'm also kind of confident that when these dudes eventually retire, they're going to go on a huge tour like they did in 2011 or for Bloodshed over Bochum and play tons of material from their old albums.  So that's always something to look forwards to, even if you don't like any of the new stuff.

"Slivers of Silence new full EP out! [Finland] Similar to Ghost Brigade, Swallow the Sun, Insomnium etc.","Listening right now, really positive impression from this.

Great mix, going for clarity rather than making the guitars super beefy in the low-range is a nice change of pace from most modern metal. Nice guitar tones overall.

The acoustic quieter parts are very nice, very glad you didn't compress it to hell, when a track relaxes it really relaxes, and gives a great contrast and an actual rest from the more energetic parts.
I can't emphasize enough how nice it is to not have it over-produced. 
2 and a half tracks in and I'm really excited about the style of songs and melodies you use. It has that sad, almost slightly empty, desolate quality that early Insomnium had. Open production, doesn't sound inappropriately big/deep/massive.

Awesome vocals, not sure what the lyrics are, but they sound honest and, again, not overprocessed/choreographed.

There's not a single weak track here man. Every track seems to know what it wants to do, and does it very well.
Love this album a lot more than the latest Insomnium album, their last 2 didn't do too much for me unfortunately. This has a much more sober, mature, desolate-feeling emotional core, which I love.

I rarely buy music these days, unfortunately, but if you guys get this up on Bandcamp or something, or if you have a bigger deal currently in the works, let me know cause I'd like to get this in lossless and wouldn't mind parting with some dough to get it.

Awesome work!

If you like dark songs like this though, I'd recommend you check out Nevermores Dreaming Neon Black. One of the darkest and in my opinion best metal albums. The darker tracks are Deconstruction, Fault of The Flesh, and No More Will."

"In Flames - Through Oblivion (New song)","This is not In Flames.

They should SERIOUSLY consider changing the name of the band. Not just because of this song, but because of everything I've heard from this album so far. Last one was decent. This looks bad."
"In Flames - Through Oblivion (New song)","how about passenger?"

"In Flames - Through Oblivion (New song)","That's the name of the [other band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_\(Swedish_band\)) Anders was in.  It blows."
"In Flames - Through Oblivion (New song)","Really, putting In Flames on this is just to try to get sales off their long-earned fanbase."

"In Flames - Through Oblivion (New song)","Every time I see a new In Flames track, I think ""maybe this will be the one that restores my enjoyment of them"" and every time I'm disappointed. With the total genre shift (no harsh vocals, no sweeping melodies, and in all honestly, nothing metal) they've undergone, as u/Drugoli suggested, they might as well change the name of the band.  "

"In Flames - Through Oblivion (New song)","Its so saddening for me, the band that got me into metal is not even creating metal anymore. Hope there is at least one good song off their new album. If not, lets hope for them to bounce back on their next album. Deeply upsetting. "
"In Flames - Through Oblivion (New song)","Rusted Nail has been growing on me a little, but this song just never catches my attention at all."
"In Flames - Through Oblivion (New song)","This will be the first In Flames album i wont be buying.  The last two albums alot of people seemed to hate the direction they went but in my opinion they were still really enjoyable, A Sense of Purpose is even one of my favorite albums.  But this i keep trying to find something in it i like, but keep coming up with nothing."
"In Flames - Through Oblivion (New song)","I actually found that pretty underwhelming when I heard it today. I was pretty excited because it was something new from In Flames and nothing more, really. I was set on buying Siren Charms a few weeks ago when I just heard the news that In Flames was doing a new album in the first place, but now I'm starting to think that won't be the case.

To be completely honest, I actually think some of the newer stuff from In Flames was decent. Sounds of a Playground Fading has some tracks I really like, as well as Sense of Purpose. Come Clarity is even one of my all-time favorite albums. I also liked Passenger (not at first though; I bought the album years ago after hearing the first two tracks and then felt let down by the rest of the album, but I appreciated the album for what it was a few years later. It's decent if you want something kind of grungy and mellow.).

This song... it seriously doesn't even sound like Sounds of a Playground Fading. This made Sounds of a Playground Fading look like Jester Race. I guess I can appreciate In Flames for not wanting to stagnate, but there's a fine balance between making 10 albums that all sound the same and straying a bit too far from what everybody knows you for."
"In Flames - Through Oblivion (New song)","I think I'll be listening to the album via spotify before deciding to buy it myself, it's just the complete opposite way of ASOP and sounds of imo this song. I can understand if they have one maybe two of these types of songs on the album such as with Liberation and the Attic on sounds of."
"In Flames - Through Oblivion (New song)","Christ... it's like listening to fucking Coldplay or something."
"In Flames - Through Oblivion (New song)","I enjoyed Rusted Nail, but this song is just plain boring. Not sure whether i'll end up getting this album or not."

"If you could only choose one song to try to turn someone into a melodeath fan, which one would it be?","Crikey.
Is all their stuff like that?"
"If you could only choose one song to try to turn someone into a melodeath fan, which one would it be?","More or less. Varies in quality (imo Holographic Universe is their best album), especially when you consider the vocalist set up changes after it (from 1 spectacular talent to a pair of guys who are good in their own right, but didn't really hit their stride until their latest, The Singularity - Phase I - Neohumanity , which I am currently listening to), but in general it's the same idea. This song is a bit more accessible though."
"If you could only choose one song to try to turn someone into a melodeath fan, which one would it be?","I always thought the new guys' sound was pretty good, but the lyrical content seemed to have veered from somewhat scientific to outright insane topics such as reptilian people. Maybe I didn't get it. I think the Ghost Prototype songs have a lot more clean vocals than is usual for most Scar Symmetry songs too, right?"
"If you could only choose one song to try to turn someone into a melodeath fan, which one would it be?","From what I remember (I stopped listening actively to them a while back, probably just overplayed it and got bored of the soundstyle that comes from Soilwork-y like bands, which according to your username is exactly your alley :P), yeah, the Ghost Prototype song does have a bit more cleans then most, although they use them a lot with the new pair of vocalists (since one does cleans and the other does the harsh ones, so they have to use them, you know?). But I'm no expect on the subject.

Lyrically, I have no idea - I usually gage a vocalists' success first hand on whether or not the lyrics musically match with the instruments (hint : loves Insomnium's Nillo Sevanen for that reason), and lyrics I google eventually if I REALLY love a song - so I can't say whether it's gotten better or worse."
"If you could only choose one song to try to turn someone into a melodeath fan, which one would it be?","It's awesome to love a song for a long time, then google the lyrics and fall in love with it again. Every once in a while the song will actually not be as good once you find out the lyrics, but with MDM, it's nearly always better. It becomes a new song, in a way."

It has a very catchy and memorable chorus and that chillingly beautiful Insomnium solo/ outro.  Not their best song by any means, but it is one I'd use to convert others who may not be used to some of their darker more depressing stuff.

"Looking for more ""aggressive"" style melodeth like At The Gates, early The Haunted, Soilwork, early In Flames","Perhaps, you'd like the melodic thrash-death approach of [The Forsaken](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/The_Forsaken/1160) while working out. I'd recommend listening to the songs 'Traces of the Past' or 'Beyond Redemption' to get a taste.

I also found Dew-Scented's full-length ""Impact"" to be of a similar vein. (Maybe their other work is better. Didn't explore them more.)

Lastly, if you check out a Mors Principium Est album, let it be ""The Unborn"". It's riffing is some high-octane melodic shit (and it contains some respite for your poor body and ears). Actually, now that I've started playing the album, let me urge you to check it out (as it's much more melodeath than the two previous)."

Looking for an old Melo death band I used to listen to bout 5-6 years ago. Completely forgot the name of them so ill describe what I remember.

Production had a cold edge to it. 

Awesome riffs, blatant ATG rip off band. 

Might be consider more metal core perhaps than death metal. 

I believe they were from Holland or the Netherlands. 

the album or band name might or might not have something to do with the roman era.

"Does r/melodicdeathmetal know any decent bands with fast tempo vocals?","So, to give a little clue of what I was looking for, here are some examples:

 - http://youtu.be/SFwJhLYRSxs (00:31-00:40)
 - http://youtu.be/IypO8dyibfQ?t=3m1s (03:01-03:15)
 - http://youtu.be/SjSamFlzMUM?t=41s (00:41-00:45)

In a nutshell, I'm looking for bands with rapid vocals, like word after word in a short period of time.
I really don't know if you understood what I meant, but if you guys are aware of similar kind music as listed above, with fast vocals or faster tempo, I would appreciate if you shared them with me :)"
"Does r/melodicdeathmetal know any decent bands with fast tempo vocals?","Maybe some of these are what you're looking for:



IN FLAMES:

[""Take this Life""](http://youtu.be/hNhyMJ6Lszw?t=36s)


[""Behind Space""](http://youtu.be/OcSMhPXGqxU?t=28s)



[""Watch them Feed](http://youtu.be/gsEG1HHZ1VQ?t=17s)



DARK TRANQUILLITY:


[""The Final Resistance""](http://youtu.be/xjK21yKoS0Y?t=28s)


[""Punish my Heaven""](http://youtu.be/UwuDhK_EV5k?t=30s)


ARCH ENEMY:


[""The Immortal""](http://youtu.be/Ikn8VYTRVuk?t=32s)


AT THE GATES:


[""Blinded by Fear""](http://youtu.be/8dFQ5OxV72M?t=1m3s)



SOILWORK:


[""Late for the Kill, Early for the Slaughter""](http://youtu.be/4YyN6zIzBfU?t=1m1s)


Edit: Typically, bands with that quick ""upbeat"" feel (e.g., the drumming during a lot of Dark Tranquillity's verses) and higher-pitched vocals do a lot of faster paced vocals. A lot of the bands with growling/lower vocalists seem to have slower paces to their phrasings, like Insomnium or Be'lakor. 
"
"Does r/melodicdeathmetal know any decent bands with fast tempo vocals?","Hmm, not quite what I desire, but thanks! It's hard to explain what I mean, and all the songs I have with those vocals, only have short parts of fast tempo vocals. I wonder if there are any bands that only has them :P Here's one more example: http://youtu.be/ddi15QlMpSY?t=1m31s (01:31-01:49)

E: Dark Tranquility was the closest one for the style I'm looking for"
"Does r/melodicdeathmetal know any decent bands with fast tempo vocals?","The example you just posted reminds me of Cradle of Filth a bit, and their older stuff has a lot of ""rapid fire"" vocals. Here is [an example](http://youtu.be/U0lm5T6zCCc?t=1m4s) of that."
"Does r/melodicdeathmetal know any decent bands with fast tempo vocals?","The Black Dahlia Murder, maybe? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdktviN5-TQ"
"Does r/melodicdeathmetal know any decent bands with fast tempo vocals?","[Darkane - Secondary Effects](http://youtu.be/s5bki7CXU68?t=2m35s)(02:35-02:55)


One of the faster parts of the lyrics is found in that part of the song. I think this might be what you're looking for.


They're like a mix between Melodic and Thrash, worth looking into."
"Does r/melodicdeathmetal know any decent bands with fast tempo vocals?","Melodeath usually has more of the slower paced vocals in general, so this is tough. Since I prefer more of the slow stuff, I couldn't find a band that does nothing but high-tempo vocals (although I have an idea of what you mean).

You already have some Persefone.

[Edge of Sanity - Elegy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5QT1736y4k) might be worth looking at. Most of it is faster paced vocally (only song from them I know fits the bill).

Sorry I don't have much else, really."
"Does r/melodicdeathmetal know any decent bands with fast tempo vocals?","Yeah well I like both, fast and slow. But I noticed that those parts with the high tempo vocals pleases my ear the most recently =)"
"Does r/melodicdeathmetal know any decent bands with fast tempo vocals?","Really liked that Stam1na track."
"Does r/melodicdeathmetal know any decent bands with fast tempo vocals?","Check out disarmonia mundi. Common state of inner violence has some real fast vocals"
"Does r/melodicdeathmetal know any decent bands with fast tempo vocals?","Yup, I got them =)"
"Does r/melodicdeathmetal know any decent bands with fast tempo vocals?","Nice lol.  U might want to check out some death or thrash metal if u don't listen already.  When I was wanting faster vocals that's what I did and I loved it."
"Does r/melodicdeathmetal know any decent bands with fast tempo vocals?","Some possible candidates:

&gt; Sorry for the silence/absence/lack of updates lately. Let's just say I've had my reasons and leave it at that.

&gt; We're currently knee-deep in the S.45 recordings, which unfortunately have been a bit delayed, as a whole, due to various reasons. However, I will start recording the vocals in 1-1,5 weeks time now, which is something I'm both dreading and looking forward to! Just waiting to receive the first 5-6 songs from Jani, who are currently busy tracking guitars, before I can get going for real.

&gt; In the meantime I will post a teaser with/for a new project I've got going with a good friend of mine, later this week, so be sure to keep an eye and an ear out for that.

&gt; More news as it happens!

When asked about the release dates:

&gt; Some time during the spring of 2015. We're aiming at mixing mid-January. Both albums are recorded, mixed and mastered simultaneously, but they will not be released at the same time. The second one will be released some time during the fall of 2015, if everything goes according to plan."

"STARKILL - Virus of the Mind - Official album stream","Very good album. I think it's a lot slower than Fires of Life, but I still like it all the same. I'm really digging the clean vocals as well. Wasn't really a fan when I first heard them but they have really grown on me 

Still though, it doesn't have that same ferocity and speed that fires of life had, which for me is what made that album so good. They do have that ferocity on God of a New World, but I just wish they went back to their Fires of Life style."

"The Duskfall - Farewell (2014 - New Song)","I really dig it. It feels like they never broke up, notwithstanding the new singer. While I do wish it was still the original singer, I think his vocals might be a little outdated since we've heard some really innovative vocal stylings recently. I think the new vocals actually makes it stand out from the cookie cutter but excellent, melodeath that they in the mid-00's.  "

"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","I personally was gonna say [Blinded by Fear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCtjAmtIGf0)

I don't even listen to At That Gates that much, but I have always felt this song defines the genre in terms of sound, harmonization, lyrical content, and riff structure"

"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","Agree, At The gates isn't my favorite when it comes to melodeath, but they stil feel like the archetype which so many bands have evolved from.

"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","I have all their albums, Disarmonia Mundi is awesome, can't wait for the new record, The Stranded is also awesome"
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","I agree but not in the way you'd think.

They very much do make straight up melodic death metal. But they do it in the purest form that sounds extremely bland and void of anything really unique."
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","The do dont they..."
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","The song that got me into melodeath...hmmm...it's either Dry Run by Dark Tranquility or Change of Heart by Insomnium.

So awesome."
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","For me it has to be Omnium Gatherum and the song [Soul Journeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42qbzF_ektM)

Melodeath in itself is a very diverse sub-genre, but Omnium Gatherum summarizes the essence of it and all that matters to me in a good band.

Hauntingly beatiful and powerful melodies, skillful instrumentalists, thoughful lyrics, great sound and overall passion for me the music. You can hear it that they make no compromises when it comes to the music they play.

And what got me into the genre...

Insomnium - [Down with the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K003TNG40P8)

Doesn't need any explanations, does it?"
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","Nope. One of the best things about Omnium Gatherum is their audio quality. For me as a HI-FI enthusiast, that is really rare. Thumbs up for good guys Omnium Gatherum!"

"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","Arch Enemy - Ravenous"
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","Disarmonia mundi-common state of inner violence.  That song hooked me."
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","I love these guys. Ringside to the Human Tragedy and Come Forth my Dreadful are two of my favorite Melodeath songs that I have."
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","Anything off of slaughter of the soul. That record was insane. 

As for me I was late to the party. In Flames -sounds of a playground fading got me into the genre as I went back and listened to older in flames back when they were still melodeath. Finally I went back to  subterranean and heard ""Everdying"" and ""Stand Ablaze"" which is when I fell in love with melodeath. If you haven't heard these two songs I highly recommend them."
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","Either [In Flames - My Sweet Shadow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbUtiOfMzpk) (perhaps my first melodeath song), but I think [Amon Amarth - Embrace of the Endless Ocean](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf8vFNQPnh0) captures it."

"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","Damage Done by Dark Tranquillity . One of my first albums and I was only 11 or 12 :) But I didn't know sub-genres back then. The one that made me discover it by it's full name is Scar Symmetry with the song Morphogenesis . "
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","In Flames got me into the genre, song in particular is [Resin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnJcu90oHEw)"
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","[Insomnium - Weighted Down With Sorrow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR6vqaa4d1s). 

It encompasses the listener with a beautiful, yet dismal atmosphere. Every part of the song gorgeously adds to the other segments. It builds a glimmer of hope before releasing all aspiration with the ever more apparent bleak reality established by mere existence. 

This song is the essence of Melodic Death Metal."
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","If I were going to pick one song to play for someone that didn't know what melodeath was I think I'd pick [Barren Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=warP8oB7sxc) This song IMHO has it all."
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","The song that got me into the genre is ""Ensiferum - Lai Lai Hei"". But my very definition of melodeath are the songs ""In Flames - Gyroscope"" and ""Dark Tranquillity - Insanity's Crescendo"". "
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","I can't say one song but I really any song from The Black Dahlia Murder and At the Gates. "
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","First melodeath song was In Flames- Cloud Connected. I just really liked/ like Anders vocals on that song. I tried listening to some of there other stuff, but at the time I first heard in flames, I wasn't really knees deep in metal yet. I hated the metal screams that most bands did, and mostly stuck to bands like Breaking Benjamin, Avenged Sevenfold, &amp; Metallica that mostly did clean vocals. I still do have a thing for clean vocals, but there's just something so epic when a singer does a metal scream. Thankfully, I've seen the light, and ditched those bands, in favor of bands like DT, In Flames, Scar Symmetry, Sylosis, MyGrain, and Soilwork."
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","Hard to pick just one. Here are a few.

[Noumena - The End of a Century](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovqHZwEOOzg)"
"What song defines melodeath for YOU?","Punish My Heaven by DT is the flagship song to me, but Victorious One by Norther (even though there's some Power in there) is also pretty standard for the genre, IMO."

I actually preferred Everfields over this song, but I have never heard an OG composition that I didn't like."
"Omnium Gatherum - Soul Journeys [2011]","I prefer almost every other song on the album to this one... but it's still a 9/10 track.

Saying that, the entire album is one of the most consistently strong albums I've listened to in a long time. Hooks you in from Everfields all the way until you get to the sensational ending that is Deep Cold (note : I didn't like the song that much, then they closed with it live, and I was awestruck at how fitting of a closer it is). The only albums that compare, imo, to that level of great consistency are Above a Weeping World (my #1, where New World Shadows is #2) and Shadows of a Dying Sun (#3) - both by Insomnium.

Also, I didn't upvote because I figured an Omnium Gatherum post is more often then not going to look like karma whoring :P"

"Any suggestions for thrashier melodic death metal bands?","Well MPE is my favorite melodeath band and my second favorite band of all time haha, so I could spend all day talking about them. I don't know if I'd call the rest of their stuff thrashy, but they do have quite a lot of fast riffs and sections nevertheless. 

[Check this one out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4dGcLRN4II)

I'd honestly recommend their whole discography so far. They have four albums (soon to be 5!), each of which has a different tone and style, but still sounds like the same band. 

Hypocrisy also has a really explorable discography.

I dunno what bands you already know, but if you don't know them, Dark Tranquillity is a must. Here are some thrashier ones from their sort of 'middle-era' (mind you, there is synth/other keyboard sounds to be found here and there, but it's not obnoxious):

"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I'm not sure if this type of question is allowed here, but I can remove if so. My current headphones are very uncomfortable and give me cable issues so I'm looking to upgrade.

What are some good headphones? Preferably under $200.

EDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions! "
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I use Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pros and they are really good imo, best headphones I ever had.

For a better recommendation you could check out the daily thread on /r/headphones"
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I always wanted these headphones because they are highly rated and looks so comfy. The only problem is they need an amp to get the full experience."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","Yea, I use the FiiO E10, want to get a Mayflower or Schiit Dac though.

And there starts the endless spiral of buying even more expensive audio equipment to ""get the full experience""."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I'm not really an audiophile that much, but I just want to upgrade my current headphones. I think I'll be fine without an amp and might buy a cheap one eventually."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","The 80Ohm version should be fine with onboard power from your PC, or a cheap sound card like the Xonar DG.

/r/headphones"
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I'm mostly using them on my laptop/mobile but I think I'll be fine with the 80 Ohm version as you said."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","Try asking on the /r/headphones subreddit for confirmation. They have a daily question thread."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","Will do!"
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","The question has been asked many times before, so a search probably wouldn't go amiss either. I just can't remember what the general consensus was on laptops and 80ohm headphones..."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","Sennheiser make really good headphones in the $80-100 range. I have the HD 202 model and I LOVE it; they cost around $90 after tax so they are affordable. Don't bother with the ""Beats"" garbage. You pay for the name, not quality."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I use Sennheiser HD600's and I'd highly recommend them, *but* they're around $330 on Amazon right now. Might be able to find a better deal elsewhere, though. Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pros are also a good option like /u/lordofprimeval said but they also seem to be a little over $200 right now.



Check out  Audio-Technica ATH-M50's, they'll fit your price range and they're also very good quality. They're one of the most recommended headphones for beginner audiophiles. I bought a pair myself out of curiosity and I can vouch for them. There's more than one model, there's also the ATH-M50X, and there's also a package deal that includes a small portable amp."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","HD600s are definitely out of his budget. They will not sound good without a decent amp which would be bare minimum another $50. 

I am a huge fan of sennheiser tho, and would definitely recommend checking out the HD598s tho."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I think the Jaycar Pro/Brainwavs HM5/Fischer FA-003/etc are a better choice for a flat freq response and are in the same price range as the M50.

OP: Check out /r/headphones, innerfidelity.com, head-fi.org."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","[Alessandro Music Series One](http://www.alessandro-products.com/main.php?p=headphones)

The MS1 is a slightly tweaked pair of [Grado SR80i's](http://www.amazon.com/Grado-Prestige-Series-SR80e-Headphones/dp/B00L1LXOWS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1410111851&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=grado+sr80i), which are widely considered to be some of the best headphones for metal among the audiophile community because of their ballsy and in-your-face aesthetic.  The Alessandro phones are subtly improved and are a little more well-rounded.

Also, since they're $100, you can spend that extra $100 you saved on sweet merch!"
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I have a pair of Grado SR225's. Can't go wrong with Grado and metal."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","Adding in my support for Grado. Damn my next upgrade is going to be expensive."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","How much sound comes out of them? I'm guessing they're not for Office/Shared environments. I like the sennhwiser HD25 and HD280s. 

The Grados do have great pedigree - it's just the open back that stops me. 

I'd also recommend the JDS Labs Objective2 + DAC for powering a pair of lovely headphones. "
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I got the Sennheiser HD438's for about $120AU back in 2009, and despite my best efforts to destroy them (I stood on one of the cups... that was a bad day) they're still going strong to this very moment. They've got pretty good all round sound quality too, so good for listening to things other than melodeath.

Don't think you can get them anymore (discontinued) but the newer HD 4XX models are a great mid-ranged set of headphones. "
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I'm using AKG k601 with a super cheapo amplifier to get some more power out of them.

"
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","LG HBS-730 - in ear headphones are great because they block out other noises and you can hear each song better"
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I use a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50's that just sound perfect. I think they're one of the best under $200 monitors around. I spent the first weekend burning them in and I was good to go. As far as I can tell everything from the low end and mids are pretty flawless (bassist of 11 years, that's important to me). The highs can push the headphone to their limits but since I don't listen to a ton of music with lots of highs that doesn't bother me much. 

I also listen to a bunch of other genres that all sound great, especially well produced Indie Rock and Post Rock.  "
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I'm most probably buying these, can't wait to check them out!"
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","DUNU 1000 IEM "
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","Motorheadphones!"
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","Did you ever get new headphones? Came back to say that the Sennheiser HD-600's are on [Massdrop right now for $274.99](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/sennheiser-hd600) if you're interested. It's a pretty good deal."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I'm leaning towards the ATH M50's mostly because of the great price and because they seem to be praised by many around the sub reddit."
"What headphones would you recommend for listening to melodeath?","I was looking a few years ago and couldn't find any.  Everything had some type of *bass boost* garbage, seemingly aimed at a different crowd and a different type of ""music.""  Maybe the selection has gotten better.  Good luck."

"Blood Stain Child - Artificial Mind (2003) [Japan]","Very bodom-y."
"Blood Stain Child - Artificial Mind (2003) [Japan]","Funny you say that. The band wanted a ""European"" sound from their music (similar to CoB and Norther albums released at the time), so they roped in Finnish producer Anssi Kippo to produce and record the album with them. Hence they sound so similar on this album."
"Blood Stain Child - Artificial Mind (2003) [Japan]","I remember reading about their old lead singer once and he had listed his inspirational bands. One of the bands was very out of the blue, very ambient, almost like if Enya was more acoustic. I listened to it and loved it but I haven't for the life of me been able to remember it.

"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","If the rest of the album sounds as boring as this, hate to say but, In Flames has just hammered in the last 'rusted nail' in the coffin."
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","lol"
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","Meh is an overstatement. This one is far worse than Rusted Nail."
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","Anders is not as good a singer as he thinks he is, that's for sure. It sounds like bland radio rock. And I didn't hate Sounds Of A Playground Fading either, but what the fuck is this. "
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","I feel like we should stop viewing in flames as melo death now (obviously) and stop expecting a Melo death album. They clearly arent going near that genre anymore.

This song is more akin to deftones/crosses and tbh i enjoy it. If i was on a melo death binge though i would not listen to this."
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","More 'mellow'-death than melodeath. I actually enjoy it too.

Edit: It's just lacking a bit of kick or a hook or something. This song reminds me a lot of Liberation and A New Dawn from SOAPF but it just lacks the crescendo of Liberation and the full chorus of A New Dawn."
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","yeah pretty much.

I still really like most of the stuff they've put out, but they are definitely becoming more of a rock band/hard rock band than metal now, but who knows, maybe there is a secret best melo death song on the album.

We can dream!"
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","Well, SOAPF had some really heavy songs (the puzzle from memory was pretty nuts), so it's not like they *can't* make that music again. And it's not like they don't sound anything like they used to; they're still In Flames, and they've still got those melodeath elements. It's just not the same as their old stuff."
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","Remeber when we used to say ""In Flames we trust""? Oh the irony."
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","I still wear the wristband :("
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","Every album they come out with, I keep hoping for Whoracle 2.0. I need to let that dream die. "
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","Youtube comment hit the nail on the head. ""but it¬¥s a good passenger songÔªø""."

"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","So bad. Let's listen to this In Flames instead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suzldZRB3OU"
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","Other bands have pulled the plug a hell of a lot earlier. I hate to say it but a life style around that kind of music has got to take its toll. These guys are a bit older now and I highly doubt are in it for the money. Just remember what they have done for us in the past. Just close your eyes, as we witness another bullet ride."
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","No, they are in it for the money. That's the issue. They are reaching out to a much larger crowd with this bland radio rock bullshit than they ever did with melodeath. That's how these bands die."
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","Sounds like a little STYE leaked in."
"More Meh: In Flames - Through Oblivion (2014)","Sounds more to me like they took SoaPF to the even more bland extreme.

I think their last good album was A Sense of Purpose, even though they stopped being melodeath around 2002. Soundtrack was still a decent album, just not melodeath.

This is just bland and boring."

"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork",""
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","Maybe MyGrain and their self-titled 2011 album. Fairly similar blend and sound to my ears:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko7gvz80ttA

Or perhaps Nightrage and their 2007 album: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-rHbDL7Ra8

Maybe Scar Symmetry, with an occasionally slightly harder edge: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQagTCycQ4s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5aB9bW5B00

Wovenwar is also with a harder edge than Soilwork, but good clean singing and lots of melodic stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7veBHqIEnkI

Feel free to mention what aspects you like about the soilwork album and I might be able to figure some other recommendations from that. :)"
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","Cheers for that! What i love is a powerful clean chorus througout this brutal genre! Example of this is Scar Symmetry The Anomaly, another example of this could be Disarmonia Mundi - Resurrection Code/ perdition haze; Dark Age - Outside the Inside"
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","You considered Sonic Syndicate yet? ""Only Inhuman"" and ""Love And Other Disasters"" are both albums from them that remind me of that era of Soilwork."
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","From them i have only listened to Denied, i like them but some seems like they repeat the same formula..could be wrong though"
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","You should definitely listen to those albums. Try listening to some Sybreed as well, they're very Soilwork-ish with a hint of industrial/cyber or whatever."
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","Cheers, will do :&gt;"
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","Some of their songs have a hard time standing out from one another, but there are some pretty decent songs among those two albums. If you're hearing Only Inhuman (since Denied is from that album), I would at the very least suggest checking out Callous, All About Us, and Double Agent 616.

I'm a bigger fan of Love And Other Disasters. If you get your hands on that album, I suggest checking out Encaged, Jack of Diamonds, and Power Shift.

Since you're coming from a Soilwork, I guess you could check out Before You Finally Break. It's a Sonic Syndicate song that features the vocalist of Soilwork, although it's off their self-titled release from last year."
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","Did enjoy that, biased cause Bjorn ""speed"" is there, i will keep digging. Stuff like the oldies Disarmonia Mundi - Resurrection Code or Killswitch Engage - My Curse"
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","Soilwork is certainly my favorite band of all time. You may be pleased to know that Speed does vocals on several of I. Legion's tracks, such as Beyond Darkness (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iyKsh8uI1m0). 

I will say that the album with Rejection Role on it (figure number five) is rather unique to Soilwork's discography. I feel their use of keyboard is more extensive throughout that album than on any other. There's also a bonus track to that album that few people are aware of, give it a try: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VLqRDcKQSZM

If you're wanting to stay within Soilwork, my recommendation for their next track would be Nerve from the album Stabbing the Drama, or Exile from Sworn to a Great Divide. They're similar enough to Rejection Role that you should be well pleased. "
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","Ye i know that one i quite enjoy soilwork and happen to own a phyisical copy of stabbing the drama, was just looking for a band within the melodic scene that kinda resembles them but its rare to find one, some bands like in flames often release tracks from the same vein but its rare, even soilwork doesnt sound much like rejection role"
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","[Rise To Fall - Defying The Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28jDh9HbEp4)

Clean choruses throughout this entire album, heavy synth, melodic.


Neptune - Acts of Supremacy (Example song: [Sterile Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_IedPD8YXw), whole album is hard to find).

Produced by Ettore Rigotti of Disarmonia Mundi, same deal here, very melodic, clean choruses all over the place.

"
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","listened to the whole thing thanks, that is more in tune to what i was looking for, his voice isnt as commanding and memorable as Bjorn`s but still pretty enjoyable, maybe soilwork will treat us to a new album right this year!"
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","Hey np, cheers."
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","It's a tricky one because like you said even soilwork doesn't sound like rejection role typically. I'll give it a try though.

For one you might want to try ""The Stranded - Survivalism Boulevard"". It has some guys from disarmonia mundi playing in it if I recall correctly so there might be something there. Haven't listened to it much so can't say if there are enough clean vocals.

""In Vain - √Ünigma"" is an album that does clean vocals really well I think. Especially on the first two tracks. It's tad heavier/darker than some of the stuff mentioned here so might be a miss.

""Noumena - Anatomy of Life"" is one that comes to mind as well. The clean vocals are female and the contrast between verses and choruses is a lot bigger but it is still one of the few bands with clean vocals left in my playlists.

""Eventide - The Beast and the Machine"" is one that fits the description. The way they do the clean vocals differ quite a bit from track to track so check more than one song."
"Looking for an album/band that sounds like Rejection Role - Soilwork","Loved Eventide, will make sure to give the other ones a proper go when i have time. Cheers for the tips!"

"All the songs are nice, but let's talk about you got into MDM. More specifically, which song pulled you over to listen to more?","Mine was The Jester Race by In Flames. Specifically that song was the first I listened to, and then I moved onto December Flower and then Colony. Basically just grew from there. They were recommended to me by a buddy that I played Bad Commpany 2 with, and then I went all in."
"All the songs are nice, but let's talk about you got into MDM. More specifically, which song pulled you over to listen to more?","I was never into the crap that played on our local radio stations growing up, and by Highschool I thought I just didn't like most music in general.  Then a friend played some Spineshank for me, which was a little better... I used Napster or Kazaa to download an album of theirs, song-by-song.  I went through the stuff I downloaded, and in classic crappy p2p filesharing manner of the day, one song was definitely not like the rest - it was the track ""Transparent"".  I did some searching and found out it was actually ""Transparent"" by In Flames.  It hooked me, and I grabbed all of In Flames stuff shortly thereafter."
"All the songs are nice, but let's talk about you got into MDM. More specifically, which song pulled you over to listen to more?","Arch enemy. Don't remember the particular song but was playing Halo 3 campaign with a buddy in the barracks with pandora on and one of their songs came on. Instantly downloaded everything from them and continued to explore the genre."
"All the songs are nice, but let's talk about you got into MDM. More specifically, which song pulled you over to listen to more?","Like most of you, it was Soilwork/In Flames that started my foray into MDM. 

Specifically my first Soilwork song was ""Nerve"", played during a local radio segment late at night. I driving home from my first job at 17, and I couldn't believe how good it sounded. In Flames is harder to pinpoint a single song, but there were some PvP videos from the game World of Warcraft back in it's glory ""vanilla"" days. Some of the first videos I remember watching shortly after starting to play had In Flames songs mixed in. I would say it was either Cloud Connected or Trigger."

"All the songs are nice, but let's talk about you got into MDM.

Probably my favorite IF song to this day."
"All the songs are nice, but let's talk about you got into MDM. More specifically, which song pulled you over to listen to more?","I'm probably going to get shit on here BUUUUT.....
 When i first started listening to metal, it was the typical ''young kid exploring heavy music'' bands. You know slipknot and stuff. Eventually i started listening actual metal, and i heard about the black dahlia murder. Completely changed me. I went backwards and started listening to gothenburg stuff, older melodic stuff, older metal bands all together. I really got into black metal because of this as well."
"All the songs are nice, but let's talk about you got into MDM. More specifically, which song pulled you over to listen to more?","I can't pick a particular song, but In Flames' Colony album got me hooked on MDM. Not only that, it was the gateway into all extreme metal with harsh vocals. "
"All the songs are nice, but let's talk about you got into MDM. More specifically, which song pulled you over to listen to more?","I think the song that got me into MDM was In Flames - Cloud Connected. I saw the video on tv once and thought it was pretty cool so I went and downloaded as many songs by them as I could. "
"All the songs are nice, but let's talk about you got into MDM. More specifically, which song pulled you over to listen to more?","Soilwork's overload was my first taste on one of those tv music channels. Then I bought the cd at sun coast and never looked back. "
"All the songs are nice, but let's talk about you got into MDM.

"All the songs are nice, but let's talk about you got into MDM. More specifically, which song pulled you over to listen to more?","First MDM song I ever listened to was Cloud Connected by In Flames after I first got an mp3 player way back when I was still in grade school. I had no way of acquiring music so I gave my mp3 player to a buddy of mine and he put all of his music on it and In Flames was one band that he listened too and put on there for me. I didn't really start to get into MDM until a few months ago when I was on the hunt for new music to listen too. Someone on here reccomended metalarchives.com to search for new music. I went on there typed in In Flames, went to their similar artists section and would just click through artists. This sub has also helped me discover a bunch of awesome bands too. I would also listen to Spotify to which helped immensely.  So pretty much through my buddy, Spotify and Reddit."

Before that I only really listened to power metal and symphonic metal so that was my first experience in scream/growls when it comes to metal. Come clarity was released the same year as that video and that's where I started. Then went into other swedish bands like soilwork, at the gates, arch enemy, hypocrisy and more.

Somehow I re-discovered the existence of Amon Amarth, and that led into Insomnium and In Flames.  I don't actually like the sound of Amon Amarth too much, but I'm really enjoying Dark Tranquility, Omnium Gatherum, Be'lakor, and Insomnium."

"All the songs are nice, but let's talk about you got into MDM. More specifically, which song pulled you over to listen to more?","Persefone's Mind As Universe (track). I've always been more of a straight death person than melodeath (and still am, by far) and had only liked scattered melodeath tracks before hearing them, but their sound convinced me to look more into melodeath and listen to it a bit more. Persefone is still by far my favorite melodeath band, but I have been listening to a lot more of it since I first heard them. "
"All the songs are nice, but let's talk about you got into MDM. More specifically, which song pulled you over to listen to more?","I would have to say Bullet Hole by The Haunted.

I was playing hockey with some friends one day probably when I was around 11 or 12 (I'm 26 now) and we always had a boombox with us. That song came up on one friend's mix and I was hooked.

More specifically, which song pulled you over to listen to more?","For a time back when I think I was in high school, my parents upgraded to Digital Cable. It came with various music channels, and I'd listen to the metal one. I kept a pen and an old junk mail envelope nearby so I could write down stuff I liked and find it later. The first MDM song I found on this channel was In Flames - A Touch of Red. Eventually I was trying to find more things similar to In Flames, though I'd never heard of the ""MDM"" term. Everything was just ""metal"". Found Dark Tranquility, then started tracking down other artists I heard on that channel like Susperia and Darkane."

"Looking for some recommendations","Hey all,

I'm looking for some recommendations on bands that are similar to Be'lakor.  Not only in how the actual music/instruments sound, but also vocally.  Imo, their vocalist is one of the best I've heard; I'm a big fan of those low, guttural growl-type sounding vocals.  

Also, I really prefer bands that use little to no clean vocals in their music. 

Thanks!"

"Looking for some recommendations","Omnium Gatherum"
"Looking for some recommendations","Insomnium is a great band and probably the closest you'll get. Great melodic death with deep guttural growls. Also check out In Mourning, Eternal Tears of Sorrow, Omnium Gatherum, Noumena (early stuff), Dark Tranquillity, and Ghost Brigade."
"Looking for some recommendations","I was going to chime in with a simple agreement and a couple recommendations of songs to listen to, but I ended up writing for over an hour. It's like picking the favorite of your own children... Sorry for the wall of text OP.

Definitely Insomnium! I'd say that 80-90% of their vocals are growls. 

As far as I'm concerned, Insomnium are *the* best Melodic Death Metal band on the planet right now. I think they are really close to Be'lakor, and haven't put out a bad album yet. Even [Metal Archives reviews](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Insomnium/2332) show their lowest ranking album (all have 9 or more reviews) of all-time at 88%. The best news of all is that they have another album coming out on the 25th of April!

I'll run through what I think their 3 best albums are (in chronological order). If my reviews seem to come across as negative, please note that I'm only picking out the tiny parts that I *don't* like. This is the equivalent of winning a Bugatti Veyron from a game show and bitching that there isn't chrome around the headlights. Yeah, this is really nit-picky stuff.
___
**One For Sorrow: (2011)** 

Clean vocals used in unison with growls, which gives the vocals a really layered, full sound to them. I will say, however, their mastering in this album was not as impossibly perfect as it had been on previous albums. The vocals and bass are a bit muted which gives the feeling of a muddy, hollow album. They do slow to a soft whisper occasionally, which slows the mood to make it more melancholic, yet in the same song (Song of the Blackest Bird) Niilo Sev√§nen drops into a growl lower than he's hit in previous decade. Still this is a very, very solid album. 

* *Recommended songs: Song of the Blackest Bird, Every Hour Wounds, Lay the Ghost to Rest, Unsung*

___
**Across the Dark: (2009)** 

Personally I think this is their best album. It reaches a perfect balance between excellent mastering and an appropriate clean vocals both in quality and quantity; The clean vocals are not very prevalent, and when they are used they don't take you out of the mood. The guitar mastery is excellent on this album, just like on every other one of theirs, which is needed to excel in this genre. The drums are very clear and don't steal the show. 

* *Recommended Songs: Weighted Down with Sorrow, Into the Woods, Down With the Sun*

___
**Above the Weeping World: (2006)** 

The use of clean vocals in this album kind of turn me off, as they come at you in the form of a weak, croaky technique that I really don't care for. 

* *Recommended Songs: Mortal Share, The Killjoy*

___
Bonus! 


**Since the Day It All Came Down: (2004)** 

While it's not in my top 3, I forgot that a couple of their best individual songs come from this album. 

* *Recommended Songs: The Day It All Came Down, Daughter of the Moon, Death Walked the Earth*"

"Looking for some recommendations","As much as I love both Scar Symmetry and Solution .45, neither have ""little to no clean vocals"" as the OP has requested.  About the only song by either band with little to no clean vocals is ""Pitch Black Progress"" off the album of the same name.  I guess ""Calculate the Apocalypse"" is also fairly void of clean vocals."

"Favorite Insomnium Song?","For you guys that dig Insomnium, I was just wondering what your favorite songs were.  I really like a lot of the stuff off Since the Day it all Came Down but also like a lot of the shit off their newer records.  Anyways post up your favorites.  Here are my top 5 with the last being my favorite.  

5. While We Sleep-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHpEzk0u6v0
I actually like the cleans in this song and they contrast and make Niilo's growls all the more brutal.  The end kind of drags though.

4. Mortal Share-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeIo499to54
The part from 2:58 to the end.  FUCK.  Has always been my favorite.  

3. Daughter of the Moon-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTUvYutNkFg
Again, the ending section is amazingly melancholic.  

2. The Swarm-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdBHZ8fFnx4
Beautiful and actually can bring a tear to my eyes.  Makes me really think that yes, as dumb and stereotypical ""we're all gonna die"" as it is, just like the album art of the Mayflies, we're ephemeral and just going to fade away one day.  Acoustic, but still my near favorite. 

1. The Day it All Came Down-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpHg3k91O0

The epidemy of all that is Insomium.  Icy intro, a chorus that makes you feel like your loved one just died of cancer and brutal riffage.  This is hands down my favorite song.  

""She was my sun and now the light has faded away 
Night condensing around me, leading astray 
Shining image torn down, remembrance of her fades 
Left but anguish and shame to haunt me in the shades""



Okay, now lets see if anyone else is as batshit about this band as I am.  "
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Mobile, so I can't link it, but Through the Shadows and The Killjoy are both excellent. Through the Shadows has a siiiiick guitar melody, and The Killjoy is just so damn catchy."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Through the shadows has an amazing opening riff.  I look forward to seeing it played live this winter when they hit my area.  "
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","In the Groves of Death is what introduced me to melodeath. The lyrics were so poetic. "
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","[Last Statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5WdYnkVmPw)

My favorite Insomnium song from my favorite Insomnium album.

""Don't forget me. Don't you forget me. Burn a candle for me... when you can."""
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","The feeling Friman put into that solo is quite something"
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Has to be [Down With The Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yY6R_1MXd0) for me.

Closely followed by Mortal Share and Ill Starred Son."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","There's a reason I call Insomnium the ""Kings of the Outro"". The ending of their songs are always the hit.

""Mortal Share"" - Forever and always. I've listened to it over 2500 times and I still get the same chill as the outro pulls in. My favorite song, period, and the reason ""Above a Weeping World"" remains my #1 album (apart from the greatness that is everything else on that album).

""Revelations"" - Same feel as Mortal Share, just not as strong. I'm a Vanhala fan so that helps.

""Ephemeral"" - The album version over the EP version. There's just something about that ending.

""Out to the Sea"" - Seriously, Vanhala.

""Down With The Sun"" - Just a classic.

Honorable mention to ""Last Statement"" for getting me out of a tough place mentally with that stellar outro that brings me to tears more often then not."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Never thought of it that way, but you're definitely right about the Kings of the Outro. Last Statement is my #1 favorite as far as outros go. I also love the ending to While We Sleep. It's like somebody suddenly sucks all the air from the room, silencing the song. "
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Vanhala is a guitar wizard.  Nothing more, nothing less.  "
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Ephemeral "
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Death walked the earth, daughter of the moon, in the halls of awaiting, black water, drawn to black. Damn I don't know every song almost! Such an amazing band. Can't wait to see them live in January "
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Same.  It can't come soon enough!  Last band I saw like them was Swallow the Sun and half their set was one song.  Good show, but poor setlist choice.  "
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Im all over Above The Weeping World, it is my absolute favorite album from them. Through The Groves Of Death, At The Gates Of Sleep, Last Statement etc.

Weather The Storm is also something id like to hear more of. Stanne does a brilliant guest-performance in it. His voice really fits!

I have yet to be disappointed by an album from Insomnium :)"
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","""Weather the Storm""... I wonder what Insomnium are going to play when they come over with Dark Tranquillity, hm?"
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Drawn To Black is hands down my favorite track by these gods. The chorus is a poem by Francis William Bourdillon and awesome I might add, 

""The night has a thousand eyes, and the day but one, yet the light of a bright world dies, with a dying sun."" 

""The mind has a thousand eyes, and the heart but one, yet the light of a whole life dies, when love is done.""

The riff that plays during the chorus is just catchy as hell too."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Yeah, that has to be one of my favorites along with At the Gates of Sleep.  "
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","I agree. :)"
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","I like the dual song to song flow of The Primeval Dark and While We Sleep. It's essentially a one song experience for me."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","[deleted]"
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","I don't really know the band too well. Haven't had the time. I only know the song While We Sleep. I suppose that's my favorite then."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","The River and Daughter of the Moon. Also, I love the guitar solo from Promethean Song."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","I'm stuck between Bereavement, Since the Day it all Came Down, and anything off of the Ephemeral EP."

"Favorite Insomnium Song?","There are so many of them, and many have already been posted by others. But one of my favorites that has not been mentioned is [Death Walked The Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRmPcgA-JU4), especially thanks to the opening riff!"
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Unsung will always be number one, but Down with the Sun, Weather the Storm, and through the shadows will follow close behind.  Obviously they have tons of other good ones, but those are my favorite."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Lol, glad everyone has some input.  Consensus seems to be that Mortal Share is a favorite among most fans.  

One for Sorrow is also a favorite of mine when I feel like shit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZMWKCgvaDY

  Does anyone know if Niilo does the cleans for this one?  Somewhere I read that he did the cleans for that album but for whatever reason, on the new album they got passed off to the guitarist.  

If he did, why the fuck doesn't he do cleans more?  The guitarists clean vocals are horrendous live.  "
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","It's Friman, Nillo has those kind of low, creaky cleans in the background. If you want an example of Nillo cleans, go to ""The Elder"". Probably the best example.

Friman's cleans are getting better live, but still nothing amazing."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","The Elder is fucking great.  I totally forgot about this album.  "
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","""Revelation"" - the harmonized guitar leads during the chorus can only be described as downright gorgeous to listen to and Vanhala's solo at the end is incredibly climactic and emotive."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Insomnium writes some of the best lyrics. Its so hard to pick just one song but Weather the Storm has gotten me through some tough times."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Weather the storm, mostly because the colaboration of Mikael Stanne."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","I'd go with ""Down with the sun"", this song introduced me to Insomnium. After that I enjoyed the earlier albums as well, great band. Really looking forward to seeing them live soon."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","It really is hard to chose an actual favorite but I quite like [Lay of the Autumn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYU0YRuiESQ) along with pretty much the whole Above the Weeping World album .. [Drawn to Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBXBnpiMuqA) and [In the Groves of Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9QCK6l6gKg) stand out the most to me though.
Needless to say, there really isn't a single song that I totally dislike. (The Promethean Song being my least favorite to date, though it's certainly not bad)."
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","Promethean is really non climatic and drawn out.  "
"Favorite Insomnium Song?","[Inertia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXGQr5Fq2lM) is probably my favorite Insomnium song these days, awesome buildup on that song and great ending as with any Insomnium song! Can't wait to see them in New York in January."

"Hitler Reacts To In Flames' New Sound","They're last album wasn't half bad, in fact it was great for what it was. Which was more of a mix between metal core (in the guitars) and melodeath. "

"Sonic Syndicate - Before You Finally Break (Feat. Bj√∂rn 'Speed' Strid)","I love me some Speed Strid and I really enjoyed the first few Sonic Syndicate albums, but this song feels very boring to me.  I thought Speed's vocals in ""Collapsing"" by Demon Hunter improved an average song to an fairly decent metalcore song.  Unfortunately, ""Before you Finally Break"" is just not piquing my interest."
"Sonic Syndicate - Before You Finally Break (Feat. Bj√∂rn 'Speed' Strid)","At work, haven't even listened to it, and I might not even remember to, but I will upvote anything to do with Strid.  Headvoice and manly singing (ala strid, Jesse Leach, etc) needs to be a bigger thing.  I would really, really hate to see it die along with the few big bands that utilize it.

Bands need to realize that singing like a chick isn't the only way to sing clean.  Manly singing with a bit of blues rasp and some headvoice is the ultimate metal vocal styling IMO, and is CRIMINALLY underutilized.  "

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfHs4FDLGYE

It's not blues or rasp (God i'd love to get a melo-death band that uses clean vocals similar to Jorn Lande or Russell Allen) but he avoids the whole singing like a chick"
"Sonic Syndicate - Before You Finally Break (Feat. Bj√∂rn 'Speed' Strid)","Yeah. It's pretty bland. I liked Nathan better when he was singing for The Hollow Earth Theory. Their last album We Rule the Night wasn't that great either compared to the 3 previous albums. Maybe this new album will be better... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Syndicate_(album)"
"Sonic Syndicate - Before You Finally Break (Feat. Bj√∂rn 'Speed' Strid)","Nothing from Sonic Syndicate has really appealed to me after the first 3 albums. Even their third album felt like it was missing something. I'm always willing to give them a chance, though."
"Sonic Syndicate - Before You Finally Break (Feat. Bj√∂rn 'Speed' Strid)","Loving their new stuff! We Rule the Night kinda turned me off from listening to them. Glad they're releasing more stuff in tune with my tastes!"
"Sonic Syndicate - Before You Finally Break (Feat. Bj√∂rn 'Speed' Strid)","The only redeeming factor in this song is the fact that Strid is one sick ass motherfucker."

Even though they have a bit of a different sound now when compared to their old stuff I don't think they've gotten any weaker because of it.

Their new album is absolutely top notch, I've just been listening to it constantly all day.

I think Celtos is my favourite from the album but they're all pretty great."

This will be my first time seeing both of these bands live (tomorrow night in Tempe, AZ). Im pretty excited to say the least and wanted to get a couple of t-shirts from both of the bands. Picked up a VIP ticket for the pre show meet and greet, and I am sure nervous yet extremely excited. "

At the same time, while I do love DT, from what I saw of their setlist, they hardly played any old or classic material, really was surprised to not see Punish my Heaven on there.  

Still would have been kick ass to see...


Oh yeah, to anyone who saw Insomnium play, did Ville's vocals on While we sleep still sound like a drunken slur?  I just remember seeing lots of videos of him butchering that song live.  "

Haha, I saw a video too and consequently braced myself for some 
shiver inducing tones when the song came up back in October in Germany, but it sounded okayish.

"The Gothenberg scene was crazy incestuous","Its kind of insane when you think about it. 

Here is an example: in Dark Tranquillity Anders Fried√©n did vocals for their demos and their first full length, Skydancer. DT of course also had Mikael Stanne as a guitarist who did vocals on In Flames album Lunar Strain. 

Now In Flames had Jesper Str√∂mblad on guitars (and drums on Lunar Strain) who also played bass on Ceremonial Oath's first album and their demo before that. 

Ceremonial Oath's lead guitarist during the life of the band was Anders Iwers who played guitar for In Flames in their early days before they had recorded any material. When Ceremonial Oath recorded their second album, Carpet, they were joined by Anders Fried√©n on vocals for one recording session (which ended up as 4 songs on Carpet with him as vocalist) who ended up joining In Flames, and Tomas Lindberg in another session (for the other 3 songs on the album). Tomas Lindberg was the vocalist for At the Gates. 

At the Gates had members who would later go on to form The Haunted and the drummer, Adrian Erlandsson, is the brother of Daniel Erlandsson who played drums for Eucharist and recorded drums for 3 of the 5 songs on the In Flames Subterranean EP. 

After Eucharist Daniel joined Arch Enemy formed by Michael Amott (formerly of Carcass and Carnage (Carnage went on to become death metal band Dismember)) and including Michael's brother Christopher Amott who also formed his own melodeath band Armageddon. 

On Armageddon's first album the drummer was Peter Wildoer who would become the drummer for Melodic Death/Thrash band Darkane. Wildoer also did almost all of the drums on Arch Enemy's second album Stigmata.

Whew and it goes on and on! There is really no point to this thread other than to kind of just jokingly show how big of a mess the Swedish Melodic Death Metal scene was lol. Still its an interesting topic and I would love to see maybe a family tree showing what members from what bands also play in or formed other bands.

*edited for mistakes/formatting "
"The Gothenberg scene was crazy incestuous","It's like 15 people started an entire genre."
"The Gothenberg scene was crazy incestuous","Not sure if there's a family tree around, but this is a pretty good read - http://www.bazillionpoints.com/shop/decibels-2008-book-of-the-year/

The whole scene seemed to just be pretty interconnected, far beyond what i'd expected/"
"The Gothenberg scene was crazy incestuous","I've been meaning to get this book for a while but the damn thing is expensive! I know he put a big list of bands in the back with some info about each one. I'm a fan of Swedish death metal as a whole, one day I'm going to bite the bullet and get myself a copy."
"The Gothenberg scene was crazy incestuous","I could have gone a bit further with In Flames. Nicolas Engelin joined for a short period from '97-'98 then joined Gardenian and after Jesper Str√∂mblad left Engelin rejoined the band. After lead guitarist Glenn Ljungstr√∂m left the band in '97 after Whoracle was released both he and Jesper formed Dimension Zero.

After both Ljungstr√∂m and Engelin left Bj√∂rn Gelotte who had drummed since The Jester Race switched to lead guitar and Daniel Svensson joined the band from his previous band Sacrilege where he drummed and did vocals."
"The Gothenberg scene was crazy incestuous","don't forget the Hammerfall connection either.  Oscar from Ceremonial Oath and Stromblad from In Flames started Hammerfall as like a side project or something.  just released 9th studio album... "
"The Gothenberg scene was crazy incestuous","Also (not melodeath) one of the guitarists in Hammerfall was in Ceremonial Oath I believe, and I think Jesper Stromblad played w/ Hammerfall briefly. Jesper was also in Sinergy, Alexi Laiho's other band, but he's Finnish so we're getting out of hand now"
"The Gothenberg scene was crazy incestuous","Then there was Nightrage. "
"The Gothenberg scene was crazy incestuous","Formed by Marios Iliopoulos formerly of Greek Melodic Death Metal band Exhumation and fronted by Tomas Lindberg (which I know is why you mentioned them) of At the Gates. The ride never ends my friends! :P"
"The Gothenberg scene was crazy incestuous","Dismember connected to Entombed thru Nicke Anderson..."

"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","I'm relatively new to melodeath but a lot of people are saying Christian √Ñlvestam. What song(s) should I listen to first that highlight his style?"
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","* Scar Symmetry - [Slaves to the Subliminal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJmttR9BQw)

* Scar Symmetry - [Ghost Prototype II - Deux Ex Machina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5aB9bW5B00)

* Solution .45 - [On Embered Fields Adust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dka_Es5pLfA)"
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Christian put out a solo ep album with only clean vocals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FINsVqb_WsE"
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Christian by a long shot, really the best in the biz. Though a second place would be Dark Tranquility's singer, Not to harsh and soothing cleans. My top 2."
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Mikael's got a set of pipes on him too. I like that he can do harsh vocals and still be understood."
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Mikael √Ñkerfeldt pre 2009. Oh, cleans like honey and growls like a slaughterhouse. "
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Aside from the obvious picks (Christian √Ñlvestam and Michael Stanne) Aki S√§rkioja from Immortal Souls, really cold (best way I can describe it) and borderline [black metal harsh vocals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foMfI4hQQss) accompanied by [beautiful cleans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1feadVsJmPw)."
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","George Kosmas is pretty good tbh"
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Petri Lindroos of Norther and Ensiferum and then theres something hauntingly beautiful with the harsh vocals from Niile Sevanen of Insomnium. 

"
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Many are saying Christian, which I agree with. However, another true contender is Alissa White-Gluz, originally of The Agonist and now Arch Enemy. She is effectively Christian's female counterpart. 

For your consideration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jud_SnKTlY

The unfortunate part of her joining Arch Enemy is that now you only get half the package; Arch Enemy is harsh vocals only. It's a shame."
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Travis Ryan"
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Howard Jones "
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Johan Hegg, Mikael Stanne, Akerfeldt of course, Tomas Lindberg."
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Going with Christian here as well. Bjorn following close behind. I just wish Christian had more material to choose from. I cant understand how Scar Symmetry can put out the masterpiece that was Holographic Universe and then lose Christian due to creative differences. Seriously, that album should have been the catalyst for one of the greatest metal, let alone melodeath, bands we've seen in recent years."
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Thankfully he's still making music with The Few Against Many and Solution .45."
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","And Miseration still?"
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","I just listened to one of Miseration's songs for the first time actually. Interested for sure. But I do believe he's still active with Miseration and Solution .45. Not so sure about TFAM though, which would be a shame because I really enjoyed SOT."
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","It wasn't due to creative differences. I saw in an interview with Per that it was because Christian insisted on handling an even bigger part of the finances of the band."
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Mine would be Tobias Netzell. The only other person that could compete with him is Christian Alvestam. 

Tobias just has this incredibly deep and brutal growl that I think is amazing when you also consider the fact that he's a very awesome singer. The part that I really like about him, and by extension Christian, is that they can switch from doing these brutal, demonic growls to these beautiful, angelic cleans in an instant. "
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Anders Friden was great, but only from Jester Race to Clayman. Jukka Pelkonen is good too."
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","They both do awesome growls/ shrieks, but I don't really care for either of their singing voices, moreso with Jukka."
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","George Kosmos for growling vocals. Alvestam is also an amazing vocalist for both the growling and clean vocals."
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","Mikael Stanne and Jari Maenpaa."
"Who is your favorite vocalist or favorite type of vocalist?","I'd have to go with √Ñkerfeldt, Glossow, and Hegg"

"Melodeath Documentary?","Black Dalhia murder's ""Majesty"" DvD documentary is one of my favorites to watch. Idk if you'd really call it melo-death though, but i love watching it. It's interesting to see a bunch of dudes in a brutal metal band act so down to earth and relatable. Worth checking out."

"AT THE GATES - At War With Reality (OFFICIAL ALBUM TRACK)","The difference between the comments here and r/metal is pretty stark. A lot of hate there for it. 

To say I'm excited is an understatement. "
"AT THE GATES - At War With Reality (OFFICIAL ALBUM TRACK)","Melodeath is a genre a lot of metalheads seem to either like or heavily dislike. When you consider it's been around for 20 years without much significant evolution (although I'd argue the new wave of the 2000's built by Insomnium, Be'Lakor, and Damage Done-to-Fiction-era Dark Tranquillity). It's a genre that's full of acts trying to be the next ""At The Gates"" or ""In Flames"" and being heavily inspired there. It's a genre that can also - at times - be extremely close to metalcore (we all know how people feel there).

Basically, it's an old genre that has a sound that's pretty token but has not seen significant growth, and people who loved it back then have arguably tired of it. Most find modern melodic death releases to be ""Repetitive, I've heard this before, I'll just go back to The Gallery/Jester Race/Slaughter of the Soul"". So I'm not surprised that r/metal isn't a huge fan of this, compared to the people who are still into that particular sound."
"AT THE GATES - At War With Reality (OFFICIAL ALBUM TRACK)","That's definitely a cohesive argument. It's just a shame really. I favour melodeath over most other sub-genres. But everyone has their own opinion and that's fine. "
"AT THE GATES - At War With Reality (OFFICIAL ALBUM TRACK)","Really good!  Can't wait for the whole album"
"AT THE GATES - At War With Reality (OFFICIAL ALBUM TRACK)","Good to see the same old formula isn't broken.

"Wolfheart- Winterborn Great Album.","Tuomas might be my favorite metal artist today. Dude's the hardest worker in the scene. I was sad to hear that he was ending his other bands to focus on Wolfheart, but it does sound like RoutaSeileu, BtD, and BSA all mashed up into one super-onemanband-group. I can't wait to see where he takes this band. Winterborn was good for a debut really piqued my interest in Wolfheart (as if it needed it). "

I (Red guitar player) looked at the sheet music, and I thought to myself ""Seems pretty simple to me"" Only reason I said that because it LOOKED like there weren't any crazy lines or sections. 

Of course it was the opposite. The downpicking section for the verse in Mortal Share was extremely challenging. And the middle section of that song to had a crazy part. 

Anyways, I digress! Thanks for listening to it as well as the kind words mate!"
"My friend and I cover Insomniums ""The Gale &amp; Mortal Share"". Thoughts","Love it.  A few comments:

Clean up the keys at the beginning.  They were blended together too much, and it made it kind of dissonant, and not in a good way.  Your goal with that kind of piano work is to make it sound like bells.  You're trying to emulate that chiming sound, and get it clear as crystal. Listen to Chopin's Posthumous C sharp minor nocturne to hear what I'm talking about, the way the melody is clearly delineated.  Clear, concise notes.  Also, the bass and melody were the same volume and intensity, you want the bass to be more subservient to the melody.

Guitar sounded loud compared to other parts of the music, but it's understandable as you're playing the guitar and not the drums.  It just kind of drowned out the vocals and drums."
"My friend and I cover Insomniums ""The Gale &amp; Mortal Share"". Thoughts","Do you mean bass as rhythm guitar? Or bass guitar? We didn't record any bass guitar. Just used the original track and played with it. As we could not find a backing track. Listening back on it. The rhythm guitar could have been turned down a few notches. 

DUDE. I love Chopin. I could play the piano better, I would just play his works all day. 

Thanks for the thought out compliment. It seriously helps when people say things like this. Reminds me to not fall into mediocrity and to work hard to improve. Hoping down the line to be decently skilled in mixing tracks! 

Thanks again man! Keep the horns high! As well as support the beauty of classical music! "
"My friend and I cover Insomniums ""The Gale &amp; Mortal Share"". Thoughts","Bass as in the lower register of the piano.  The entire first half was about the piano at the beginning, as I'm a pianist.  I love metal, but can't really judge you on that part (not that I would, because it's fucking awesome)."
"My friend and I cover Insomniums ""The Gale &amp; Mortal Share"". Thoughts","Ahhh, Yes I understand! Will take note mate! "
