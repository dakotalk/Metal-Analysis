"True English Anglo Saxon Black Metal, Forefather - The Shield Wall","My favourite album by them, so solid. Wudugast (Ours is the Kingdom) is such a good song on it."
"True English Anglo Saxon Black Metal, Forefather - The Shield Wall","If only the lyrics were in Old English! That would make it even trver Anglo Saxon. ;)"

"True English Anglo Saxon Black Metal, Forefather - The Shield Wall","And for more Old English/Anglo Saxon metal, [Ragnarok (UK)](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Ragnarok/784) are an older band worth checking out, slightly dubious recording but some nice songs."
"True English Anglo Saxon Black Metal, Forefather - The Shield Wall","Making that comment about Old English was probably the best decision of my life. So many amazing recommendations. 

Thank you! Really enjoying Ragnarok. "

"Wyrd - Ashes of Man and Oak and Pine","The whole album is absolutely amazing!"
"Holdaar - Königsberg (Official Video) - [4:54]",""
"Ancalagon - Betrayed Glory",""
"Springtime Depression","Been super into this album for the last few months, was wondering if any of the other Forgotten Tomb records were worth diving into? Any other DSBM recs? Thanks. First time on this sub !"
"Springtime Depression","Have you listened to any Gris, or Sombre Forets? Also they have a split together that is just incredible.

My favorite song from each:

[Gris - Le gala des gens heureux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dYQrFqo3qM)

[Sombre Forets - Étrangleurs de Soleils](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te24up_gZaU)

[Miserere Luminis- The Mist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssdYLUafUOc)

Also some other bands you might be interested in that is a little more on the shoegaze dsbm side.

Heretoir

Thranenkind

Infinitas

Also it stretches some of the confines of DSBM but a really good one that has a lot of classical music influence is

[Way To End - Various Shades of Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWGc-uj1Oj8)

"
"Springtime Depression","Cool, thank you. I really enjoy the ColdWorld I've heard. Coincidentally I like the band Cold World. "
"Springtime Depression","I am really enjoying Thränenkind. It's very on the shoegaze side but I really enjoy it's atmosphere. Almost a post-rock vibe. "
"Springtime Depression","Yeah, personally my favorite material form Thranenkind and Heretoir is the split they did together, I think its the best material either of them have done, definitely worth checking out. Glad you liked it."
"Springtime Depression","Songs to Leave is great as well. Definitely a more raw version of Forgotten Tomb, but it is still Forgotten Tomb. Every single track on that album is fantastic. Love's Burial Ground is also good and absolutely worth checking out (Alone and House of Nostalgia are the best tracks). Negative Megalomania is alright, never got super into it. One good track on that album is I think called Blood and Concrete? 

Their newest album, Saturn or Jupiter whatever the hell isn't that good  if you ask me.

Springtime Depression really is a flavor of Forgotten Tomb that they didn't recreate in any of their other albums though. That album seemed to use a lot higher fidelity in the recording, and was overall more ""polished"" than their other albums. Overall though, it's a tossup between Songs to Leave and Springtime Depression for my favorite Forgotten Tomb albums."
"Springtime Depression","Thanks, I'll definitely spend a little time with the ones you mentioned you enjoyed. Cliche as fuck, but back in June I was left by my lady of four years, and I really got in a dark place, and dove head first into albums like Springtime Depression. Got me threw some long nights. Feeling better now but that album still fucking rules. So melancholy. Best word to describe its atmosphere."
"Springtime Depression","Yeah man I hear you. Springtime Depression and Forgotten Tomb in general got me through some really, really dark times but I still listen to it pretty often nowadays. 

Another great DSBM band is Abyssic Hate. The album Suicidal Emotions has to be my favorite DSBM album, but it is a bit lo-fi, which you say you aren't a huge fan of below. You might really like the band Dolorian. They're similar to Forgotten Tomb in that they're depressive black doom, but definitely a different take on that particular sub-genre. Hope you find some stuff you like."
"Springtime Depression","If anyone has a spotify playlist I could sub that would be cool. I have a pretty extensive black metal one but not a ton of dsbm on it. A lot of 2nd wave. And motherfucking Cor Scorpii "
"Springtime Depression","What other sorts of DSBM do you have or have heard?"
"Springtime Depression","ColdWorld, Lifelover, make a change...kill yourself, shining, leviathan. Nothing obscure. (Well, by our standards.) never could get into silencer or xasthur. But I only heard Xasthur tracks that were extremely lo-fi, and I have never been able to get into the verrrry lo-fi tracks"
"Springtime Depression","I'm not sure what xasthur you heard. [This is one of my favorites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwuGs_hVZc)

"Springtime Depression","Anti is great. The Insignificance of Life of one of my favorite black metal albums."
"Springtime Depression","Cool. It was a long time ago. Thanks for the suggestions, I'll check it out. "
"Springtime Depression","When I see the DSBM acronym my mind immediately goes to Thy Light as my absolute favourite. His first release Suici.de.pression especially still gives me chills.

EDIT: there exists a less active /r/dsbm/ as well."
"Springtime Depression","I am digging totalselfhatred and psychonaut 4. Also liked dödsferd - suicide and the rest of your kind will follow. "
"Aeternus - Burning the Shroud",""
"Ov Hell - Invoker",""
"Ov Hell - Invoker","Why are people actually upvoting this?  
This is the very definition of a cash grab."
"Ov Hell - Invoker","I wouldn't really say that this is a cash grab. Just ask the average Dimmu or Gorgoroth fan if they know of this musical project's existence. For me, that's not what I want this song or album to be. This album has many good songs on it in my opinion. 
Sure this album has one of the most famous Black Metal vocalists of all time, but that detracts from what I find interesting about this album. To me, it's interesting that some musicians who are well known in their respective scenes of music have these obscure musical projects that very few have heard of. Granted that this album isn't a GREAT album as I'd take Darkened Nocturn Slaughtercult's Nocturnal March or Darkestrah's The Great Silk Road over this any day. I just wanted to bring forth some Black Metal that I like and what other people might like without any controversy. "
"Ov Hell - Invoker","Cool name drops."
"Ov Hell - Invoker","this was going to be gorgoroths 7th album if the name dispute didnt happen"
"Ov Hell - Invoker","That by itself isn't very heartening, seeing what gorgoroth has been for years."
"Hellfucked - Leibstandarte Luzifer",""
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal",""
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","One of the best live shows I've ever seen. "
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","seconded. i went catatonic

also i was hammered but im not splitting hairs"
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","This is my favourite Inquisition album."
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","Their newest album is really good and still a disappointment compared to this one."
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","Not sure how I feel about the vocal style, but the instrumentals are killer! I'll have to keep listening, I guess. See if it grows on me"
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","They do grow on you. I see them as just adding to the trance - It's not really drone metal, but the instruments are supposed to kinda 'hypnotise' you, and the vocals add to this effect."
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","This is brilliant! Is the rest of their stuff like this or is there any more slower black metal like this?"
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","The rest is a little faster, I guess. If you're looking for slow black metal, check the song Black Lava by Satyricon, and The Abyss Looks Into Me by Oathbreaker. They have that same kind of slow filthy black metal sounds. If you find any more, please let me know ;)"
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","Enjoyed both those, especially Satyricon, thanks. If I stumble across anything with similar sounds I'll let you know. "
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","Another slower and moody Black Metal band that I highly recommend would be The Ruins of Beverast. Incredibly dense music with the same lyrical themes (albeit more flavorful content) than Inquisition.

The recent output from a band like Mayhem (their album Ordo Ad Chao) also comes to mind."
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","Checking out ROB now, liking what i hear, thanks man.

"
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","Saw these guys in Chicago with Behemoth a bit back. Was completely blown away! I used to listen to music and a kid while sleeping and Id have cool dreams...but as i got older the night music tapered off for years until recently. Anyways, I swear this album gives me the craziest dreams of anything i've listened to in recent memory. This is an awesome album!"
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","Sounds cool. I will be receiving a nice headphone soon, I'll give this a try :)"
"Inquisition - Desolate Funeral Chant. Filthy slow black metal","This is my favorite black metal band."
"Nåstrond - ""Winter of Obscurity""",""
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Im looking for more bands that sound like Chrome Waves or Deafhaven, any suggestions? "
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","/r/blackgaze"
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Maybe [Lantlôs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_ApaSELFUM) or [Germ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFnvVmrizCw)?"
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","This may be a bit off, but try [Wylve](http://bandcamp.fallenempirerecords.com/album/wylve), [Cosmic Church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1ZTtlIyuKY), or [Sun Worship](https://sunworship.bandcamp.com/)."
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","I am really liking Wylve, but having trouble finding more other than 1 more song on Youtube.  Is there anything else out there?"
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Check out Fallen Empire records bandcamp. The Rain in Endless Fall and Wylve share members, and Lluvia formed from the ashes of those two projects. "
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Unless I'm mistaken, Wylve basically disbanded after that demo. But there's good news! They (he?) are reformed as Lluvia, which is an even better band in my opinion. Check out their full length at [Fallen Empire's bandcamp page](http://bandcamp.fallenempirerecords.com/album/premonicion-de-guerra).

You CAN download it for free there, but it's in 2 tracks: one for each side of the record/tape. If you like, I can send you my personal copy of the files. I used some audio software to split the songs up into the 8 individual tracks.

If you feel like getting a little rawer, maybe check out Min Kniv as well."
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Sombres Forets is a good Canadian band. "
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Check out the old soul/ nic split that came out last year. You'll love the old soul parts at least. And the bands Bosse-De-Nage, and liturgy. "
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Clair Cassis might be up your alley."
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Isn't that who those velvet cacoon people became after they plagiarised all that music?"
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","I don't know about any plagiarism, but yeah, they used to be Velvet Cacoon. I think I like what they do as CC better."
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","They stole entire albums off other people. It's actually a really interesting story but at the end of the day they are frauds and plagiarists. 
http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Velvet_Cacoon/15954"
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","check out Hope Drone"
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Addaura. "
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Winterfylleth!"
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Woods of Desolation! I'd also generally recommend Skagos, Altar of Plagues, and Drudkh's later work (their earlier is better, but later is when they get a post rock influence)."
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Not exactly post-black metal but check out the album Wind's Poem by Mount Eerie. It's more ambient/shoegaze/drone than it is black metal but it's the most black metal non-black metal album."
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Altar of plagues?"
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Well Deafheaven are just the Burzum sound with a bit of shoegaze mixed in as far as I can tell, so you'd probably like Amesoeurs and Alcest.

I don't feel like it should be described as ""post-black metal"" though, the sound has been around for 20 years and there's nothing new or interesting about it.

I've heard ""post-black metal"" used to describe second wave black metal bands who veered off into avantgarde territory like Arcturus and Sigh, I'm not sure if that's commonly held though."
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Awesome, thank you for the detailed reply. I do enjoy Alcest, ill have to give Amesoeurs a spin, as well as Arcturus and Sigh. 

Im not to big on the specifics of genre or post this or post that. I saw them described as such, hence why I label them that here. "
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","No problem. I think what you're describing as post-black metal is a portmanteau of black metal and post-rock, whereas the older definition is post-black metal in the way that post-punk is to punk, if that makes any sense, but then it's got so much variety within it that it's hard to lump it into a single genre at all, it's more just a name for a collection of bands that went weird?"
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","I agree with that. Either bands carry on with what they know will work or they get out and branch out to other genres. Such is music."
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","As mentioned above, Lantlos, which shares members with Alcest. Also, try Fen, Averse, and Woman is the Earth"
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Amesoeurs, Alcest, and Deafheaven all sound nothing alike. Also wait until the people who think Deafheaven are screamo come into the thread. Actually, they're likely going to avoid the thread, considering that this basically equates Burzum to screamo in their eyes."
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Like what the fuck is ""post"" black metal.. Ugh"
"Post-black metal...is this the right place?","Harakiri for the Sky will be up your alley

"Panopticon - Black Soot and Red Blood",""
"Panopticon - Black Soot and Red Blood","The isolated Bluegrass tracks on this album are great, but the actual Black Metal just falls flat. I give this guy credit for creativity though, because he has a very cool idea. It's just that the execution of the actual Black Metal isn't very good, and he tends to just isolate the Black Metal and the Bluegrass, rather than combining them. "
"Panopticon - Black Soot and Red Blood","I prefer that imo. It's hard to mix those instruments together effectively because a banjo especially would get lost in the mix. Not to mention it's played different than the guitars are. I think he does a good job though at bringing in strings and flutes when necessary."

"Leviathan- All Tongues Toward","Loving the way this sounds, could maybe do with having the vocals higher in the mix.  That's mostly just because I really like his vocals."
"Leviathan- All Tongues Toward","Didn't Billy Anderson, of Sleep and Burning Witch fame, produce (/have something to do with the production of) this album? Seems like I remember something about that on his FB feed a while back. (I'm too lazy to confirm for myself.) 

But it sounds terrific to my ear. For the effect(s) on the listener Jeff so clearly wanted to achieve, I thought the vocals were pitched at a suitable place in the mix. Can't wait to hear more."
"Leviathan- All Tongues Toward","I spent the entire night with it on repeat, drinking and drawing the album art but putting a little bit of my own twist on it. Glad you showed us it's out."
"Leviathan- All Tongues Toward","I really wish he'd ditch the fucking audio mastery. His own recording methods are cool as hell. Still better than most anything, but call me a faggot that I think Leviathan's getting worse. Obviously he's getting more skilled while rejecting a part of what makes his music great - the recording process as an instrument in itself."

"[Symphonic] Carach Angren - Killed And Served By The Devil (2015) [Netherlands]","This. If this was the first track I heared, I wouldn't have pre-ordered (which I did). Pre-ordering is not something I usually do as I like to have heared an album first since you can never really count on past experiences to be more than an indicator. In this case I was swept up by the excitement of the first track and at the very least I feel like I wouldn't mind giving them my money for the entertainment they already gave me. If for nothing else than the extremely enjoble closing gig on their tour with Vreid and Mistur. Other than all sorts of fun happening onstage where the bands where upstaging eachother, the CA frontman singlehandedly made their show mesmerising. I think I can honestly say it was one of the more remarkable shows I 've seen in 25 years, just because of his theatrics, which could easily have slipped over into the realm of silly antics but didn't."

"Came with Carach Angren's new album.","I don't really listen to much symphonic black metal but this is one that knows what they're doing. Atmospheric appeal I assume."
"Came with Carach Angren's new album.","Their first 3 albums were amazing and if you're a fan of symphonic black metal, I would advise you to check them out.

However, I would not start with this album. In my opinion it is terrible. The only redeeming aspects are the symphonic parts. The guitars used to be relatively melodic, staying in key, and acted as a lead for the symphonic aspects. In this album, the guitars work against the rest of the music, creating a cacophony.

Further, the theme is utterly stupid. It's literally about Fairytales, specifically Hansel and Gretel. While I'm not saying there's absolutely no way an album regarding Fairytales wouldn't suck, that is not the case here. In my opinion (and I really did love this band prior to hearing this album), it sounds like a sociopathic 6 year old wrote this album while snorting meth."
"Came with Carach Angren's new album.","Yeah I don't know, I like my black metal to have some form of fantasy but I watched the lyric video and cringed at ""domestic violence""..."
"Came with Carach Angren's new album.","Cringe when he straight up talks about Hansel and Gretel or screams ""Mommyyyyyyyyyyy"" (or Momma or something like that). Contrast this with Funerary Dirge of the Violinist and you can see why I truly dislike this album and really lost faith in the band."
"Came with Carach Angren's new album.","It looks cool and I want it. What is it?"

"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","Just curious. "
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","No. They've been a death metal band from the beginning. They consider themselves to be a death metal band. They're a death metal band"

"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","Was that a joke?"
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","of course, of course"
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","They have a very black metal-ish atmosphere. I know a lot of black metal fans who enjoy them but, definitely death metal.  "
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","cool, cool, that makes sense"
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","This is the correct answer."
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","gotcha!"
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","Nah, it's a video game"
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","Finally, some sense"
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","I thought it was obvious they played death metal. There may be some blackened bits, but it's primarily death."
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","I guess so, idk I suppose they are on the ""darker"" side of death metal, that and their stage presence/aliases/stories/lyrical nature made me think otherwise "
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","None of the shit you listed matters. What matters is the music itself-- the rest is just pomp and pageantry. Their riffing styles and drumming patterns are all characteristics of death metal more than they are black metal."
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","Visual and conceptual aesthetics play a huge part in a band's general style. Music as an art form in total encompasses anything that drives the sonic experience as a whole. Music can be heard &amp; felt through your eyes as well. If it couldn't, the 60's-90's never would have happened."
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","King Diamond looked Black Metal but weren't Black Metal."
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","It's not about what you ""look like"", it's how that image relates to the aesthetic you *identify with.* King Diamond wasn't black metal, but Mercyful Fate certainly was (at least to the same extent Venom, Celtic Frost, and other ""first wave"" bands did), and King merely took the style he had adopted and brought it to the new project. Sure, King Diamond's music incorporates some undeniably ""blackened"" musical aesthetics as well, but they don't orchestrate it towards the forefront of their style. They may have looked black metal, but they weren't advertising themselves as black metal, therefore not identifying themselves with that scene/style. "
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","First wave wasn't actually black metal, m8. It's just a broad term describing the bands that influenced- mostly aesthetically and thematically- what would later become black metal. "
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","I'm well aware. Hence the quotations around ""First Wave"". In the context of audial-visual aesthetics, first wave black metal is extremely important, as it introduced a whole new take on the incorporation of stylistic design having an impact on the music it is paired with. In the context of music history, first wave black metal didn't exist, and is a categorical blanket term."
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","This is slightly off topic, but do you know any articles that compare and contrast the different riffing styles and drumming patterns of death and black metal?"
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","True, but the drums especially sound like black metal techniques. Blast beats aside, even the fills sound familiar. As for the guitar, yes I agree"
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","It's definitely death metal, but I can see how you'd think they're kvltish. They're very doom cult. Huge following from the doom cult scene."
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","If you ever have to ask, the answer is no."
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","That's a pretty good rule of thumb"
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","At first I thought you meant the video game and I was really confused"
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","Nope, death metal."
"Would you consider Portal to be a black metal band?","I've heard some people refer to Portal, Abyssal, Ulcerate, et al as ""post-death metal"" due to their focus on dissonance and suffocating atmosphere, and drawing parallels with DSO. I can kinda see that, but at the same time, I don't think it's different enough to warrant yet another genre subdivision."

"Black metal track that I wrote and recorded in the past 5 hours.","Very good mix, all said. The tremolo riffing I found enjoyable, though I thought the transition near :52 was a tad wonky (?). Nothing wrong with that, I suppose. Some cool vocals sung cleanly and otherwise and etc. 
The only beefy critique I have is what someone else here mentioned: vary the fills a bit more; for being such a slow tune, I'd say it left me unconvinced as to whether you could pull off a whole album in this style. But that's very easily manageable! 

The mixing is the hardest, and you've got that down fairly well.

The only basis I kind of get for this guy's points he's trying to make is on social media, and guess what, it's the fucking internet and on the internet it's not just the metal ""community"" that's racist and sexist you can't look up a kitten video without racist and sexists remarks"

I've never known any of the metal friends I respect to ever point out something negative in a person on behalf of metal like they're some representative. It wouldn't be weird to think of McSorley as a jerk, but for fuck's sake, this irrelevant PC heavy metal castration crusade is godamned redundant. No one is gonna have a revalation because of an annoying editorial. Such things are just polarizing self affirmation from bitchy hippies in jean vests.

Well, that's exactly what Phil was doing. Just sayin'.

The USBM ""community"" is a joke.  Music journalism is an even bigger joke.   

What's juvenile and insecure is glorifying music about death and hate and darkness... while being an overly sensitive sissy who uses SJW codewords and gets buttupset at the word ""faggots"".  At least Phil believes in what he writes.  At least he *lives* it.  I really don't even need to defend him because he honestly doesn't care about any of the supposed fallout from his remarks.

Until he deletes it from facebook like he does all the time. Same thing with Meacham for that matter.

I guess policing bands on social media for not being ""manly"" enough (this after he's publicly praised Caina in the past), counts as ""telling it like it is"" these days.

I've known Phil online for a number of years and cut him out of personal correspondence because his racism, homophobia, and misogyny have just plain gotten out of hand.

how about fuck off? Varg was THE MOST infuential person for the scene, both musically and ideologically."
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","This, so much this.  Black metal isn't about acceptance.  It's about hatred.  If you aren't down with hatred, fuck off, your flowery bullshit is **not wanted**."
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","The music at its core is indeed about an expression of hatred but who says you have to be a raging dickhead in order to make it or enjoy it? I have plenty of hatred within me but somehow I'm able to not be a cunt out in public. Most musicians who make black metal are the same by the way (unless you only listen to Eastern European NS bands, in which case, can't really speak for them)."
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","So in other words, hate all you want, as long as your hatred is confined to a number of set subjects pre-approved by your local college cultural studies department.  Rock and roll, man!"
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","That's not what I'm saying at all. I don't care what people want to do with their music. I'm not asking for censorship of art. Far from it in fact. This whole thing is based on treating other people within the scene like people based on their actions (and taste preferably). I'd rather someone be judged on whether or not they find Liturgy to be palatable than if they're gay or a woman. If that's not black metal enough, I really couldn't give less of a shit. Guess what? Logan from Diocletian loves Taylor Swift. MkM and countless others are huge Lana Del Rey fans. Paul Ledney does embroidery. No one is 100% black metal all day every day and most people don't want to be. 

Uphold traditions of hatred in music, even ones expressing NS ideals? Fine, but to force everyone who enjoys this music to abide by it constantly outside of an artistic context is outdated and stupid honestly. "
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","So you want the hatred confined to the music?  Somehow I don't think you'd be alright with McSorley writing a song about how much he hates Kim Kelly and Caïna.  Seems to me like he was attacking people for their actions, namely their efforts to force left-wing tolerance ideology onto the black metal ""scene,"" and he used exactly the kind of language guaranteed to piss off both them and their allies.  Seems to me like he did a good job of it too.  Although major caveat, I'm not cool enough to be Facebook friends with them.  

Anyway, though you claim not to want to censor the art, you definitely want to censor the artist, which is effectively the same thing.  If you blackball all the people who are truly misanthropic and thus treat others with an automatic lack of respect, then there's no need to censor the music because you've already removed everyone who would have made something transgressive.  

&gt;   Guess what? Logan from Diocletian loves Taylor Swift. MkM and countless others are huge Lana Del Rey fans. Paul Ledney does embroidery.

Irrelevant, but great namedropping there.  Am I supposed to be impressed?  If they start calling for putting rape trigger warnings on Clandestine Blaze albums, then I'll care.

&gt; force everyone who enjoys this music to abide by it constantly outside of an artistic context

No one's forcing anyone to do anything, except you people trying to apply whatever pressure you can to force them to shut up.  You don't have to friend them or tweet them or buy their records.  Anyone coming into black metal expecting to not be offended deserves to be made uncomfortable."
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","What pressure exactly and who is being forced to shut up? Phil is still doing Recluse. Nothing has changed beyond Erik and Phil splitting up. He can still say whatever the hell he wants. Doesn't mean he's going to avoid criticism for what he says though. No one told Erik to do what he did and if he can't get on with someone anymore to the point that it impacts him creatively, then how is he supposed to continue on with that person? I get what you're saying about people with certain personality types making transgressive music but I don't think any metal writer has the power to ""blackball"" any band (let alone remove them) unless you mean not giving them press, or giving them negative press (which probably helps them honestly), which is entirely within their right to do. 

And for the record, I named those artists as examples of people with relatively decent reputations for hateful black metal because who is honestly as truly misanthropic as they claim to be? Even Phil gets concerned about how things he says are perceived (if he wasn't, he might leave his messages up where he attacks fans for asking questions about their orders). "
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","It's pretty obvious that you view the ""scene"" or ""community"" as a wonderful thing to belong to, and it stands to reason that being cast out of that ""scene"" is a pretty serious punishment.  I also anticipate that much like anyone who associates with other people who have offended current-wave feminists, their labels are going to start getting a lot of shit and will be forced to drop them.  

You don't get to support the imposition of current-wave feminism and left-wing ""safe space"" ideology onto black metal, which you clearly do given your consistent support for its proponents, and then at the same time pretend that you have no interest in eradicating certain viewpoints, because those two things are in effect the same.  It's really no secret that the movement is censorious - ""you can't say that"" is basically the battle cry.  Any college campus provides plenty of evidence of the use of speech codes and hecklers' vetoes, and now the same kind of rhetoric pops up [again](http://shamelessnavelgazing.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/inquisition-and-black-metals-fascism-problem/) and [again](http://meatmeadmetal.wordpress.com/2014/12/15/on-hatred-respect-and-treating-people-like-humans-in-heavy-metal-circles/) and [again](http://www.wonderingsound.com/feature/caina-settler-of-unseen-snares-broken-limbs-interview-up-next/) in relation to black metal.  Real black metal is and always has been a reactionary, individualist movement - not only is all this social justice crap totally foreign to it, but it is antithetical to it.  Anyone who takes the side of musicians or writers who pretend to the contrary is an enemy of everything the music stands for.

Like I said, I don't care if Belkètre had a knitting circle in their spare time.  Everyone has extracurricular hobbies.  No one is bringing Lana del Rey into black metal, but the people you support are trying to bring social justice into black metal.  Neither of those things belongs there.  Have the good sense to keep them out.  "
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","C'mon, name one black metal band who's been dropped by a label for pissing off feminists or racism awareness groups or whatever. One article now and then speculating about somebody's fringe right leanings or advocating some cultural change (and these are the ones everybody seems to cite since there really aren't *that* many) doth not a censorship crusade make.

There are like five openly racist metal (not even nsbm) groups that people outside that ideology give a shit about anyway, with *maaaybe* Arghoslent and GBK being the only really prominent ones outside of second-wave bm. And in the case of the second wave, people respect them musically but generally find them as people to be laughable clowns at best or at worst, obnoxious fuckheads who pulled a tantrum and did dumb shit their progenitors are still pulling away from and disclaiming. Pretty much EVERYBODY has moved on from the ideological baggage, hardly the far-right unanimity you're portraying."
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","I never said all black metal bands are right-wing, only that there is a general anti-PC-garbage attitude.  And outside of the Pitchfork ""USBM"" scene, there definitely is.  I guess if EVERYBODY has moved on from ""ideological baggage"" as you say, pretty much the sum total of Finnish black metal bands missed that memo, since in all the interviews I've read/heard they emphasize the importance of anti-social ideology in black metal as a whole (examples: [1](http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles.aspx?id=1-335), [2](http://wyrdwordsandeffigies.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/interview-with-finnish-black-metal-band-forgjord/), pretty much the entire Loputon Gehennan Liekki documentary).  The same would go for most Polish bands, from Graveland, Fullmoon, and Veles in the 1990s through to Ohtar, Dark Fury, Szron in the 2000s and nowadays, and many of the most prominent bands from Ukraine (e.g. Drudkh, Hate Forest, Kroda).  But then again, someone told me that no one cares about any of these bands, so they are irrelevant and we should only care about what luminaries like Deafheaven think.  

Fortunately, most labels have the testicular fortitude to resist dropping bands with unsavory views, but venues are constantly canceling events or facing intense pressure to cancel events based on the wild speculations of antifa groups, even in North America (example: the first Messe des Morts festival almost did not occur as described in the first paragraph [here](http://www.u-zine.org/interview.php?id=275) - ""...ces emmerdeurs de rouges extrémistes et la salle de concert ont encore essayé d’annuler notre concert (comme cela arrive régulièrement à différents groupes en se basant sur de faux jugements et des accusations infondées). Mais, lors du spectacle, le public a exprimé son mécontentement, ils ont donc échoué..."").  But again I guess that  no one cares about bands from Québec like Forteresse or Monarque, only good wholesome American bands.  

You don't have to be a Nazi or a fascist to attack the appropriation of black metal by groups who are diametrically opposed to the whole idea behind the genre (and who bear a strong resemblance to Christians in their enthusiasm for peace, love, and tolerance).  It is extremely irritating to find it suddenly filled with ""USBM"" fans whose defining characteristic is their wimpish oversensitivity.  Casual listeners and pseudo-Christians should have no place in black metal."
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","I guess I disagree with the assumption that a subgenre ought to have any particular ideological bent behind it. I mean, despite some album titles or liner notes luminaries like Darkthrone and Immortal (who even devotees ought to respect for their earlier work) have made a point to distance themselves from misanthropy and bigotry, and even many ambiguous acts like Drudkh which hit on the pagan/heritage themes often avoid any explicit political commentary, leaving anybody guessing what they might actually believe along those lines.

Is there something ""more"" legitimate, qualitatively speaking, to misanthropic, ugly, jagged, bm? Sure, for most people, and I definitely share in that preference. But I think if you were to perform a survey most people see that as a frequent trapping of the genre rather than some sort of ideological alignment, and there's room for a Slechtvalk or an Antestor every now and then, or the legions of bm fans who hear a lot of the initially raucuous noise as nostalgic or affirming or contemplative in an odd way after acclimating to it. Many of the really gnarly themes of metal are just a proxy for an assertion of individuality anyway, unless you're Jon Nodtveidt and think you're gonna summon a dragon with your lyrics or oughta go stab somebody for being different or something. People saw the consequences of that second wave nonsense, and even those who didn't see it as an obnoxious reactionary temper tantrum eventually decided that the consequences of actually embracing it just weren't worth it.

Then again, the mere sound of the music is often intended to differentiate itself from anything your average person might like, and intended to assure underground status (even if you don't intentionally prune your fanbase like Peste Noire or something), which may be seen as implicitly misanthropic, so maybe I'm completely wrong here."
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","Just read the thread. The story is all there. Honestly, I'll be happy when this is all over. "
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","The single worst thing that could ever happen to metal would be to make it PC in any way, shape, or form.  Too bad Erik Wunder won't let his bandmate's opinions stand or fall on their own, and evidently doesn't think he has the right to keep them without penalty."
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","Or maybe his opinions are damaging to the creation of his art? Why would you work on an artistic endeavor with someone who you can't relate to anymore or who has now made your band associated with noxious politics that you never wanted in the first place? That would be lying to yourself if anything.

No, metal will never become ""PC"" but that doesn't mean bands have to tolerate their reputations being dragged through the dirt on account of a band member publicly being a bigoted cunt. Winterfylleth did a similar thing when a guitarist started yapping about ""White Pride Worldwide"". If Erik was concerned about being ""PC"", he would have dropped Phil a long time ago as he's been saying shit like this for years."
"Phil McSorley kicked out of Cobalt","I would work with somebody, even befriend somebody, whose ideological views do not match my own, or whose politics I found ""noxious"".  I realize that I'm in the minority on that, but I think its a big part of why I see the world as such a divided and partisan place.  Having read McSorley's facebook comments I can't really defend him - not for the content, but for the juvenile way in which he delivered them (and, as a personal insult to someone).  If this is indicative of his general demeanor these days then I suppose I understand the decision a little better."

No no, I'm glad you responded as you did. I'm friends, and family for that matter, with people who don't share my politics. There's no need to divide your friends among political lines (I probably wouldn't associate with an out and proud Nazi honestly, but that's just me).

Like I said, he's been posting offensive shit to social media for years. Stuff about ""killing towelheads"" and racist caricatures. This is just the first time he's gone out of his way to attack people (completely unprovoked by the way) personally and this is very indicative of his general demeanor these days. At a certain point, you can't excuse it anymore because it starts to affect your reputation as an artist which is clearly worth more to Erik than keeping Phil around (which is completely understandable and reasonable IMO)."

"I'm in a one-man black metal project, would love some second opinions on my music","I actually quite liked the vocals, but I would agree with comments that they're just slightly louder than they need to be. The guitar parts were top notch, but I did notice in my studio monitor headphones there sounds like there's much more going on my left side than the right, but if you intended it that way then that's totally fine.  Other than a couple mixing issues that be easily fixed this song was honestly pretty badass and I look forward to hearing more of your work."

"Enslaved - Thurisaz Dreaming","Dude good production and clean vocals is what Enslaved does now. They're doing their own progressive form of black metal instead of pooping out some typical culty noise for crust heads to argue about who listened to it first. Riitiir was awesome in my opinion and this album seems like it should be a pretty good follow up judging by this song. "
"Enslaved - Thurisaz Dreaming","True, but this sounds like it could have been pulled directly off Riitiir. Hopefully this album explores some new territory a little more."
"Enslaved - Thurisaz Dreaming","Hopefully it does. I loved Riitiir as well. And Axioma Ethica Odinì I though was killer.

I've always had a fantasy though that Enslaved would surprise everyone and release an album like Blodhemn with the production quality they have now. I think that'd sound so killer."

"Slægt- ""Her Vil Jeg Dø""","Glad you enjoyed it. I didn't know Posh Isolation put out metal either, and I follow them relatively closely. This seems to be a first, possibly because Slægt is Danish? It's hard to say, but I'm into a lot of the stuff from both labels involved. Also, I'm glad you enjoy my blog. I feel that people who are into electronic/experimental and black metal alike benefit most from what I do. I often imagine purists aren't quite as into it."
"Slægt- ""Her Vil Jeg Dø""","I actually got into black metal because of the overlap with the darker electronic/experimental scene.  I've never really been a ""metalhead"" otherwise.  I don't think other metal subgenres, like death metal or whatever, have nearly as much crossover with that scene."
"Slægt- ""Her Vil Jeg Dø""","That's an interesting comment. I definitely grew up with industrial music but lost interest after a while. I found extreme metal (especially black metal, obviously) and it led me back to electronic, industrial, and noise. I probably attend more live performances of electronic and experimental music than I do metal shows these days. It just works so well."

"New Black Metal from Vegas dropped today. ""Vanishing in Bloom"" by Wallower","Yeah definitely. My favorite was the last track. It's angsty in a way, but it was derived from a 90's midwest-emo shoegaze feel, so the screaming is not meant to drone but to sound like he's being tortured by his own mind... Pretty spacey concept but trust me their energy on stage just touches your soul and opens your mind in a way that not a whole lot of performers can achieve."

&gt;

&gt;The __Dyatlov Pass incident__ was an event that resulted in the death of nine skiers north of the [Ural mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_mountains) on the night of February 2, 1959. The incident happened on the eastern side of [Kholat Syakhl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kholat_Syakhl), whose name in [Mansi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansi_language) means ""Mountain of the Dead."" Since then, the mountain pass where the incident occurred is called Dyatlov Pass, based on the name of the group's leader, Igor Dyatlov.

&gt;The absence of witnesses and the subsequent investigations concerning the death of skiers inspired intense speculation. Investigators determined that the skiers tore their tent inside out, fleeing on foot under heavy snowfall. Although the bodies show no signs of struggle, two victims had fractured skulls and two broken ribs. Soviet authorities determined that an ""unknown compelling force"" had caused the deaths; access to the region was consequently blocked for hikers and adventurers for three years after the incident. Due to the lack of survivors, the chronology of events remains uncertain.

"Looking for recommendations of numinous ""dark metal"" kind of sound","Definition of the numinous has something to do with the intimation of spectrality in negative space.. can be literally a ghost or not … the monolith from 2001 is a weird example , another weird example is the band Offspring who have often had very paranormal themes to their music , I know just about everyone here wouldn't call them metal but nor would many of you classify Blue Oyster Cult as metal neither and I think there is something seriously wrong with that, Black Sabbath is not a metal band but predominantly a stoner band. I'd say Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is their most metal album, along with Dio's stuff, but most of it not so much. It's not a style of music to me but something thematic . It's not *about* vikings either. Says something about missing the forest for the trees? That'd characterize my feelings about most black metal out there. 

Bands like,

Bethlehem -- Dark Metal

Evergrey -- In Search of Truth

Paradise Lost -- Icon

Krohm -- A World Through Dead Eyes 

Evoken -- Quietus 

Samael, Tiamat, Rotting Christ, stuff on Century Media records has a lot of this . If I was to be really picky I'd say that Agalloch is not a black metal band but a folk band, but that Ulver is firmly black metal in terms of chilling effect .  A lot of Offspring's music has quite a spooky vibe to it and I think they're a very misunderstood band, far more metal than they ever were a punk or hardcore band. It's not really the style of music I go for but the sound or the theme ."

No. Take out those ideological/thematic elements and a band is still a black metal one- metal genres aren't based on imagery, ideology, or feels. Just riffs.

"Acoustic black metal??","Drudkh and Holdaar both made one acoustic album apiece."
"Acoustic black metal??","Someone asked a similar question a few weeks ago, instead of pasting my comment, you might want to read the [whole mediocre thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMetal/comments/2s3tek/forgot_name_of_acoustic_black_metal_band/) to see what other people [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUy7bl_6YqI). Here is [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMetal/comments/29iozw/what_is_some_black_metal_with_classical_acoustic/) with a few suggestions too, hopefully that helps in some small way."
"Acoustic black metal??","I'm not sure how an ""acoustic black metal"" thread could be anything *but* mediocre.  "
"Acoustic black metal??","lol"
"Acoustic black metal??","John Denver."
"Acoustic black metal??","I compleatly agree."
"Acoustic black metal??","Check out a lot of the bands under the ""neofolk"" genre tag! A lot of of the folk-derived/volkisch black metal groups typically have acoustic side projects or generally more folky material.

Here's what I'd recommend for straight neofolk/acoustic black metal:

* Ulver - ""Kveldssanger""
* Agalloch - ""Tomorrow Will Never Come,"" ""The White""
* Burzum - ""Hliðskjálf"" [more ambient than acoustic/folk]
* Drudkh - ""Songs of Grief and Solitude""

I'd also recommend Ancient VVisdom and Boduf Songs: neither are what I would consider black metal by any stretch of the imagination, but they're certainly influenced by the aesthetic. Boduf Songs' ""Burnt-Up on Re-Entry"" is probably the best place to start in that respect."
"Acoustic black metal??","The following album by Mondstille is only acoustic in places (reminds me of Taake with acoustic interludes), and the last half becomes entirely instrumental/acoustic:

- Mondstille - [Am Ende...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w0q_DECCxo)

This is the highlight of the album for me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bxTWlWOME"
"Acoustic black metal??","Not Black Metal, but theres lots of great crusty folk punk bands that use fast riffs and screaming in their lyrics. Like Daze N Daze, Blackbird Raum, Broken Bow. Granted, lyrics are nowhere close to those of black metal. so if you're in it for lyrics stick to neo-folk. probably not what everyone's looking for but its worth a look if you're into folk and/or crust punk. "

"What Black Metal releases should I be excited for in 2015!","Post info about ""any"" intersting release that u know has been announced or rumoured. "
"What Black Metal releases should I be excited for in 2015!","Anything coming out on Fallen Empire Records. Terratur Possessions is probably another one to look out for. Also Rebirth of Nefast is finally releasing their debut (no clue about the label though). "
"What Black Metal releases should I be excited for in 2015!","Yeah Fallen Empire Records is great, loving Vorde right now. Who do you expect to hear from out of Terratur Possessions? I only know their Icelandic black metal bands Sinmara and Svartidauði.

So far, I'm looking forward to hearing Melechesh's ""Enki"" in March and Negura Bunget's ""Tau,"" which I think comes out in late February. "
"What Black Metal releases should I be excited for in 2015!","Vorde is fantastic. Awesome live band too. 

Terratur has spearheaded the Nidrosian scene out of Norway. One Tail, One Head, Dødsengel, Mare, Vemod, Celestial Bloodshed etc. I'd be happy with a full-length from One Tail, One Head. 

Really looking forward to the Martröð 7"" coming out on Fallen Empire as well as any new material from Lluvia and LVTHN. The Misþyrming LP is coming out next week and being co-released by Terratur Possessions. 

I didn't dig the Melechesh track I heard from the new one. Sounded kinda sterile to me. "

"What Black Metal releases should I be excited for in 2015!","Dick yeah!

I talked to Jef a lot about why TTTW was such a departure from the standard(strange word for such a genre boundary challenging band) a couple years ago while he tattooed me. He explained there weren't many blasts because he was having some serious personal problems (he tracked that entire album fucked up) and because he's getting too old to blast the way he used to.

I'm hoping it was more of the former, as he's in a great place right now. I'm happy for him, and I'm hopeful this new record will have him on his game."
"What Black Metal releases should I be excited for in 2015!","Wow thanks! Its my dream to get some ink from him. Where's he work? I'm from the east coast but if I'm ever out west I'd love to set something up. "

"What Black Metal releases should I be excited for in 2015!","He said in a facebook post that he has the demos sorted and all that's left to go as recording in the studio, he has so many ideas in him and he works with such a large number of musicians on each album that I think it'll live up to any expectations we've come to make of new saor material."

"Looking to diversify a compilation with a little black metal","Well, it's your compilation, but DSBM, known for long, slow, depressing songs, mixed with grindcore? Seriously?

That being said. Check out Anaal Nathrakh if you haven't. They aren't DSBM, but they have aspects of black metal and grindcore, so it might fit in nicely."

Idk. You could post multiple times on the same reddit thread that a band should kill themselves. That's super edgy. "
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","I thought I made it quite clear that I don't just go around telling people online to ""Kill themselves"". Because that's rude and edgy.

But in this case, they really should kill themselves. They even named their band after a method of suicide. ""Boohoo, life is so tough."" If it really is so tough, then go kill yourselves already. Preferably by a Ghost Bath, hehe....

It's for this reason that [Nidhoggr](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Nidhoggr/11720) is one of my favourite DSBM bands. At least he went through with it. Seriously, am I the only sensible one here?"
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","So Cannibal Corpse should fuck you with a knife? Behemoth should actually sculp the throne ov Seth? Shining should all commit suicide? TotalSelfHatred should hate themselves? I can keep going like this, but you get the point.

How thick do you have to be to spew out this nonsense. 

""You can't be a fan of Black Metal, and then enjoy something like this.""

Who the hell are you to tell me I can't be a black metal fan because I enjoy riffs like this? So I can't enjoy wine or whiskey because I enjoy beer? How old are you?

Lots of questions, answer them at your own pace buddy."
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","What I mean is: I don't want stuff like this in /r/BlackMetal. What am I supposed to do if I enjoy actual traditional Black Metal? ""Blackgaze"" and Black Metal should have no overlap in fanbase. 

Also, I'm not saying all bands should follow exactly what their lyrical content says. But Cannibal Corpse doesn't talk about violating you with a knife during interviews, do they? Ghost Bath, even in official interviews, continue to spout their garbage about hating themselves. The world would be better off without them."
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","You could write entire albums designed around ""spells to fall asleep by"", which, if not for legacy aspects, would come across as pretty fucking stupid. "
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","I assume you're referring to Burzum? 

Well, if so, you're incorrect. I've fallen asleep to Burzum numerous times, only proving that the purpose of his albums seems to be effective. He's actually committed to his theme, and has never drastically changed his sound away from the ""Spells to fall asleep by"". He's committed to that sound, and has no reason to change it. He pioneered Black/Ambient Metal, and many bands have copied him. 

I would respect Ghost Bath a lot more if they gave themselves a Ghost Bath."
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","Just another band sucking the dick of trends and indie rock critics. There's no sense of identity to bands like this or sunbather, just endless aping of albums that came out 10 years ago packaged in an easily digestible format. No point in even mentioning that here cause the 20-something's will down vote you away. But why does everything have to be such a copy? Whenever one band does something slightly unique suddenly it's a thing and bands like this have to come and act like they own it. So weird to me.  Blackgaze doesn't have to be a thing.  "
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","Granted, I didn't really give them a chance. Once that riff came in, I stopped. It was sounding really evil for a minute and a half, then IDK I'm just not looking for that. Maybe I'm picky. "
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","Say what you will about Deafheaven or blackgaze comparisons - this is damn good. I've been waiting to hear this for a while and it did not disappoint. "
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","These guys are really overrated. I think the only reason why they're getting so much hype is because they're from China. If they really hate life so much, they should all just kill themselves, rather than torturing the world with their hipster scene kid depressive garbage."
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","I doubt they're even actually from China.  This whole thing is way too perfect of a package for Western media outlets to be real.  There's something very calculated about the whole thing and it makes me immediately suspicious.  Velvet Cacoon v.2.0  

Edit: According to M-A all the members are American.  Bullshit publicity stunt.   "
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","One member is American and they recorded in America is what I heard. The singer and the primary songwriter are for sure Chinese."
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","&gt; for sure Chinese

Is there any actual proof of that?  They almost never post to their Facebook page in Chinese (and certainly never beyond a sentence), all their lyrics are from what I can tell totally devoid of any grammatical/syntactical errors (which is an improbably impressive feat given that Scandinavian bands make mistakes all the time and they learn English in grammar school), almost all of their promotional pictures appear to be taken in North America (since Chinese graveyards are not the same as ours, and it doesn't really snow in Chongqing), they for sure recorded in the US since they said as much in the interview that got posted here somewhere, and they're suspiciously coy about their actual location.  It's actually not a trivial thing for a Chinese person to get even a US tourist visa, and recording might require a temporary work visa, which are even harder still to get.  

So yeah, it's *possible* that they might be Chinese, but I think it's very unlikely given how disconnected they seem to be from really anything in China and how connected they are to Western labels and media outlets instead."
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","&gt; Velvet Cacoon v.2.0

Never really followed Velvet Cacoon. What was their deal? "
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","They lied a lot about their backstory, but they also stole music from other people (which to be clear, I am not accusing this band of doing).  Their singer claimed to have been committed to an asylum, and they supposedly used a special ""diesel-powered"" guitar to record with, but he later admitted it was all fake.  "
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","Don't you have a Der Stürmer song to overpraise or something?"
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","Der Sturmer is pretty good; Dark Fury is better, imo."
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","I can't stand Der Stürmer. Think they're boring as fuck. For me it's a band for whom politics matters more than music. "
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","I'm not really a huge fan of Der Stürmer, to be honest. When I want NS music, I listen to RAC."
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","You 'want' NS music? As if you could ever possibly discern the difference from regular black or death metal without having already known they were a NS band?

But anyway, RAC sucks and Arghoslent and GBK fucking rule."
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","You know what I mean. If I'm in the mood for NS, I prefer listening to RAC over NSBM. 

And I'll have you know, RAC does *not* suck. Maybe some of the big names do, but there are some real gems. I suggest:

Landser, No Remorse, Honor, Aryan Terrorism, Pluton Svea, Blue Eyed Devils, and Evil Skins. Skrewdriver isn't too bad either.

But yes, I agree that GBK and Arghoslent are great. But GBK is heavily inspired by RAC, so there's really no reason as to why you may think RAC sucks."
"Well, have at it. Ghost Bath's new album streaming in its entirety.","This reminds me of mid-2000s metalcore, but without the breakdowns."

"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","I and Demonaz are the black n' roll side projects of Abbath and Demonaz  respectively.

Some pretty damn good stuff there, both only have 1 album (Between two Worlds, and March of the Norse.)

I usually listen to that in the spring after the grim, black winter has thawed out."
"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","I'm still awaiting the second I album. The dudes said they were working on the second full-length back in '08! Whatever happened with that is beyond me.

With that said, I can't believe Between Two Worlds was released 9 years ago. For a while, it was my go to album whenever I drove anywhere in the beginning months of the year. Such a fun album with some catchy riffs. Definitely a great black n' roll album for sure."

Basically just listen to black/thrash bands and see what's good but those are some of the bands I like.

You might also like G.I.S.M."
"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","Horned Almighty is great black-thrash/black and roll. Start with the song Works of Witchcraft "
"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","Carpathian Forest. The ""Fuck You All"" album."
"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","A lot of people are giving you black thrash bands, but here's my personal list of black n roll:

Chapel, Midnight, Bastardizer, Maax, Speedwolf, Old, Obsessor, Promiscuity,  Gravewurm "
"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","Vreid."
"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","Kvelertak maybe? They're a cool band nonetheless"
"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","Kvelertak seems to get thrown in the whole ""hipster black metal"" pile with Wolves in the Throne Room, Liturgy, Krallice, and Deafheaven, but Kvelertak are rad as hell. One of the best live bands I've ever seen."
"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","That is *really* unfortunate if so, because they don't sound even a little bit like any of those bands. Just looking at Kvelertak and WITTR in the same sentence feels really strange. "
"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","I agree. I think Kvelertak is just a very solid band making black metal influenced music. They don't really have a gimmick, don't claim to be anything they're not, and put on one hell of a show."
"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","My mind immediately went Taake."
"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","I don't really know what black 'n' roll entails, but I think I can guess from the name. Vlad Tepes is a great Black Metal band. Although they're kvlt lo-fi shit, they have a lot of influence from Thrash, and I see a lot of similarities to Rock Music in general."
"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","Thanks for the input - those bands, although good, sound more as though they're going back to the Venom thrash roots, whereas I'm looking for more along these lines. l https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_WlraCXwD0 l I know there's a group of younger British guys who fit this category, but fuck knows if I can remember what they're called. I'm pretty sure they had a debut release last year or the year before."
"Who are some good black 'n' roll bands?","To me, Black N Roll is all thrashy songs about drinking and partying. Which is why Gehennah are awesome.

First, there are the BM precursors : [Black Sabbath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUQA9wVNAN4), [Mercyful Fate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSaXd9UlRrY), [Venom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qcl_BHBhhXM), [Bathory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFLj1WFJmMA),
Old school thrash metal like [Celtic Frost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsEFZrzc458), [Bulldozer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7_2Dpss5w), [Kreator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9_2uq7Erm4), [Sodom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR_Fq9MYaXI), [Coroner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq_-GSq4Q8c), etc. aka the first wave of BM.

The huge influence retroactively : [Kraftwerk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WT4bXfPZcc),  and the whole Krautrock scene heavily influenced the noise rock scene during the 70s and after that like [Neu!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQCTTvUqhOQ), [Faust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv_XdLfJaFg), etc. watch some docs about Krautrock and Moog if you want.

The 80s Batcave/Deathrock/Cold-New Wave/Goth, really important part of the theatre/folklore behind the BM: [Christian Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2Rj1gINBYk), [Sister of Mercy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GwWra1sQgo), [Clan of Xymox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G-yZmf6o8A) (if you like Lustre and Ambiant BM), [The Cure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzFmlRCyVUs) (Carpathian Forest made [an excellent cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyBIzxRrvA)), [Virgin Prunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMMHf2mJV1g), etc.

The arch nemesis : Old School Death Metal : [Obituary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcptsZUEGnw) or anything by [Death](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2l9mciyQ-YfSpXPJ4mvkpE5GCvqU9yPB), really. Some people have more knowledge than me about this scene and should be able to link some of the best death metal albums of all time. Try /r/Deathmetal 

You need to know your classics [Wagner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4Iuxy0X4I), [Mozart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqZivUlWUGw), [Saint-Saens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyknBTm_YyM), [Dvořák](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4-1RN8nIc),... if it's called ""Requiem"" or Dies Irae, as a BM fan, you should like it.

I hope you'll find this list informative.

EDIT: I forgot about the Punk/Hardcore Punk scene from the 80s (huge influence with their lo-fi, fast as hell songs, cheap production and instruments) : [The Misfits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XSQcBJmL0o), [Bad Brains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga5ZbMMZ6Hk), [Black Flag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om6ho37eSYE), etc."

&gt;The __Black Speech__ is a [fictional language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_language) created by [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien).

&gt;One of the [languages of Arda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Arda) in Tolkien's [Middle-earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth) [legendarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien%27s_legendarium), it was spoken in the [realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realm) of [Mordor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordor). Tolkien describes the language as being created by [Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron) as a [constructed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) to be the sole language of all the servants of Mordor, thereby replacing the many different varieties of [Orkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc_(Middle-earth\)) and other languages used by his servants. Tolkien describes the language as existing in two forms, the ancient ""pure"" forms used by Sauron himself, the [Nazgûl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl), and the [Olog-hai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olog-hai), and the more ""debased"" form used by the soldiery of the [Barad-dûr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barad-d%C3%BBr) at the end of the [Third Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Age).

In other words what are some albums that have been important to the scene yet outside the genre.","Current 93, Lustmord and Coil if you're into the more esoteric, atmospheric sort of black metal.  Trouble are also fantastic, in spite or perhaps because of their being christian.  King Crimson and other psychadelic rock acts synergise pretty well.  I guess it really just depends on what it is you get out of black metal.  I like the kind of harsh, nihilistic brutality of it, but there's a romanticism at the heart of it too, even if it's in the form of the nostalgic nationalism of Peste Noire or Burzum.

There is some truth to that. I think they brought the nature thing to a new level though, making it the central theme of the genre and trying to reflect that musically. Emperor for example will still have this more Satanic feel to it. "
"This man/woman doesn't like Cascadian Black Metal clearly. What is your opinion on this specific wave of black metal?","I do agree. And it did come off as cliche. Never got into this band, but there is a giant precedent for what they were saying. I've got some books with interviews from the old norwegian guys and they sound similar. "
"This man/woman doesn't like Cascadian Black Metal clearly. What is your opinion on this specific wave of black metal?","Yeah, it's this classic black metal we're extreme elitist bullcrap again.

I wonder if it's worth anything. "
"This man/woman doesn't like Cascadian Black Metal clearly.

i however am a fan of the ""movement"" if you will i absolutly adore Alda and Ash Borer, as far as i'm concerned good music is good music and while i may not be a huge WITTR fan some of their stuff is quite good."

"This man/woman doesn't like Cascadian Black Metal clearly. What is your opinion on this specific wave of black metal?","I'm a big fan of American and Cascadian BM, for the most part; it nails the hypnotic aspect of the genre that I'm drawn to, and as others have said, all the nature talk isn't exactly outside the established confines of the genre. That said, this video is just pointless and catty, and I'd like to know what this guy has contributed to black metal himself."
"This man/woman doesn't like Cascadian Black Metal clearly. What is your opinion on this specific wave of black metal?","IIRC, there's a conceptual reason why the music is as repetitive (read: cyclical) as it is. It has to do with natural seasons and life &amp; death cycles. Not that that's any kind of excuse, but listen to any of the bands also in the scene (Fauna, Skagos, Echtra, etc) and you'll find the same conceptual symmetry."

"This man/woman doesn't like Cascadian Black Metal clearly. What is your opinion on this specific wave of black metal?","I like it because I LOVE drone music and the cascadian stuff reminds me of drone, the only difference is they just tremolo pick instead of play one long note lol"
"This man/woman doesn't like Cascadian Black Metal clearly. What is your opinion on this specific wave of black metal?","I like the wall of sound effect it has too. It's very entrancing."
"This man/woman doesn't like Cascadian Black Metal clearly. What is your opinion on this specific wave of black metal?","yep, I'm honestly not the biggest fan of the cascadian stuff, but I'll be damned if I'm not a sucker for W.O.S. production"
"This man/woman doesn't like Cascadian Black Metal clearly. What is your opinion on this specific wave of black metal?","The video itself is dumb. It's already been said here, but for the most part, most bands living a ""trve"" black metal lifestyle, are dark hippies. Nothing wrong with that; however, wittr seem pretty pretentious and their music is contrived and not very original and lacks any musical dynamic IMO.

"Imperial Triumphant - ""Dead Heaven"" song premiere (technical USBM)","Dude, say what you will about IT, but Artificial Brain has absolutely nothing to do with BM at all. Not that they aren't phenomenal."
"Imperial Triumphant - ""Dead Heaven"" song premiere (technical USBM)","Your call. I think Imperial Triumphant is fantastic, and embody a more avant-garde/forward thinking image of modern black metal. Their new record is one of my most anticipated for 2015. If you are willing to give them another shot, their album can be streamed at their Bandcamp, and at only 25 minutes, it isn't a huge investment of time. http://imperialtriumphant.bandcamp.com/album/abominamentvm

This looks really spammy, but I have no connection to these guys other than I really dig their music. I just think other people may be interested in it due to the dense complexity of it. As well, I know some people have a hard time getting into the older black metal, so this may appeal to people who like a more modern sound.  

On the topic of Artificial Brain and black metal, I thought their demos had a slight black metal tone to them. Did anyone else get that? "

"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","Hey guys, I've long wondered how DSO gets their drums, since they don't credit a drummer (or anyone) and the metal archives doesn't list a drummer for them either. I've heard the argument that their drums are unplayable, but I don't buy that at all -- they're challenging but there are a host of drummers out there in today's metal scene who could learn that stuff in a day. And they've never really sounded synthetic to me, until yesterday when I was listening to 'Drought' and specifically on the track 'The Crackled Book of Life' where you can just hear the drums and the choir, they sound very programmed to me. In particular the cymbals, which have that characteristic Drumkit From Hell sound (especially when played rapidly one after another). I've never wanted to believe they used a drum machine, and I was skeptical before, but now I'm wondering if it's all programmed. If so, it's skillfully done, and you can't argue with the end result... but it's a shame.

Anyway just wondering if anyone else had thoughts on this.

EDIT: link to the exact part I'm talking about. Pay attention to the cymbals in particular. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=renZtnPZlFU#t=183"
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","The best speculation seems to be it's one drummer doing two or more drum tracks. It's definitely not one continuous drum recording, but DSO never gave specifics so it's impossible to know for sure."
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","I don't think they are programmed, but can anyone say for sure?

edit: speaking of DsO, I really hope they put something out this year."
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","Their last EP was released in 2012, so it can actually be a possibility. "
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","No, seems far too human. There are 'sloppy' parts where, say, alternate blast beats start flamming and going out of sync etc. I doubt they would purposefully add human errors like that if they were going to use a drum machine.

I'd say it's a human drummer, all done in separate takes and put together. Regardless, they're the fucking tits and since they're not a live band, it doesn't really matter either way at this stage."
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","Yeah I totally would agree; I mean I'm listening to Si Monvmentvm right now and it either sounds like a human drummer or just about the most meticulous human-mimicking-purposefully-slightly-sloppy drum programming job that's ever been done. However, that's not completely unprecedented (see Eschaton by Anaal Nathrakh). But yeah if it hadn't been for that one part in 'The Crackled Book of Life' I'd have never doubted it was real drums. That part just sounds really drum-machiney to me."
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","For comparison, see Sarcofago's use of a drum machine on the *Crust* EP for an example of extreme double bass that's programmed."
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","Exactly, drum machines really stick out when it comes to double kick and/or blast beats, it's a dead give away. There are 'human' elements you can add like swing or some newer drum sample programs like Superior or Metal Foundry even have 'human' you can mix into it.

With that even you can still hear the mechanical precision and repetition of samples. Deathspell Omega do not contain anything similar to what I've heard any other bands with programmed drums. So either they're the full on masters of drum programming and put a ridiculous amount of effort into making it sound human, or they just recorded it live in studio, in parts most likely.

To be honest the speed of Deathspell Omega doesn't really warrant the need of a drum machine, anyway. Stamina for a live show would be tricky for songs like Chaining the Katechon, but for recording it wouldn't be too much of a problem. I know drummers that would be able to do it themselves in a studio situation."
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","Didn't Reaper have an algorithm, or something along those lines while ago, that had the ability to make drum tracks that were programs sound a little bit more human? It was basically like a sliding scale that slightly moved notes out of time to make them seem a little bit more human?"
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","Not sure, never found anything like that. Wouldn't be surprised at all though, that program still amazes me, always finding new shit."
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","I wish I was a serious enough musician to actually understand it. I ran across that function in some YouTube video for Reaper about programming drums."
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","""Humanize"" yeah. I've used that on drum tracks. It just randomizes the timing and the dynamics slightly. Sometimes it just makes things sound weird though."
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","[deleted]"
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","Pretty sure they use as a drum machine, but Mikko and/or Hasjarl rarely give interviews, so who's to say? "
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","You're right. Those cymbals sound like DFH. There are lots of ways to humanize programmed drums. They might be tracking parts of it with triggers and using the samples in EZ Drummer or DFH and combining that with programmed parts. Conversely, DFH cymbals are mostly samples of Sabians, so maybe that's what we're hearing. I'll have to listen some more. Haven't paid much attention to these guys, but, strangely, this has my interest piqued. "
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","Definitely not programmed. Hell, even Clandestine Blaze has real drums. As for unplayability, there are drummers of this caliber nowadays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axw0Z44zdv4"
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","A far unsubstantiated theory I have is that they utilized Jamie Saint Merat from Ulcerate from Fas' onward. He talked briefly about shopping himself out to extreme metal compatriots in France specifically in a couple interview I read on him. Outside of that and speaking as a drummer, I think the biggest issue is mostly just endurance when approaching their compositions. Besides the tricky time signatures and such."
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","Mikko is a goddamn machine, so yes."
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","no, they don't.  won't say who it is but its not programmed.  come on guys, drummers are REALLY good nowadays.  I could play all their stuff if I practiced it."
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","Um, I explicitly mentioned in my post that the reason I have doubts is *not* due to the difficulty of the parts."
"Does Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?","oh, by all means, excuse me.

it was more a response to this thread, as in why can't it be a continuous drum track?  that's how 99% of the drummers I know do it in studio."

"Having Difficulty Getting Deeper into Black Metal","So I've been trying to get into black metal for awhile now and I just can't seem to like much of it. I'm pretty turned off by the production to be honest. Here are a couple albums that I've tried that I did like though:

-Enslaved: Below the Lights, RIITIIR
-Immortal: Sons of Northern Darkness, At The Heart of Winter
-Carach Angren: Where the Corpses Stink Forever

My favorite type of music is prog metal and my favorite band is Opeth. Just wondering if you guys could steer me in the right direction to better appreciate black metal?"
"Having Difficulty Getting Deeper into Black Metal","Have you considered suicide?

If not then this isn't the genre for you."
"Having Difficulty Getting Deeper into Black Metal","Here's a few: Weakling, Seirom(or just look up any of Maurice De Jong's projects ), Midnight Odyssey, Wolves in the Throne Room, Leviathan, Furia, Mgla(Groza album)"
"Having Difficulty Getting Deeper into Black Metal","Opeth is one of my favourite bands as well. There's quite a few black metal artists that are similar (particularly atmospheric/folk black stuff), if you can find it.

Standard-ish accessible black metal:

[Blut Aus Nord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FKjDJDZQ3w), particularly the *Memoria Vetusta* albums

[Mgla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aFGuKwF2ic)

[Altar of Plagues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1-7wBP70MQ)

If you want something more folk-y or atmospheric:

[Panopticon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb2UhUKTRXo)

[Elderwind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jewP1R9gbog)

[Drudkh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBnyyfvDwX8)

[Dark Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVRcX7Mb_3U)

[Saor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVk3wvcP8TI) (much more folk here than black, but still a decent record)

I'd also highly recommend [Alcest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxZ5Pi1I4pg) if you're an Opeth fan, although that's really starting to stretch the black metal label.

"Playlist of All Black Metal Albums on Spotify From 2014","Wow, yeah there are many essential listens but they will vary a lot depending on who you ask. In my opinion, most people getting into the genre seem to enter phases much like the progression of black metal ""waves"". Pretty much everything 2nd wave and norwegian is essential listening. Mayhem albums up until Declaration of War, Satyricon's albums up until Now, Diabolical... Darkthrone's albums up until metal hiking punks, Burzum's albums up until prison, Emperors albums, etc. Then from their most people go backwards and look at what was first wave. Bathory, etc. Then move on through the years to discover Watain, Secrets of the Moon, Deathspell Omega, Xasthur, etc. If you are interested in hearing what I consider the best released on spotify from last year, check out my top ten albums playlist here: https://play.spotify.com/user/1275803544/playlist/5nxn3VpDWqP3El4823nqmU

"Thantifaxath - Gasping in Darkness","&gt;First group i've ever heard using 6 and 12 tone row techniques

Got a source for that? Their music is certainly chromatic, but I haven't noticed any usage of serial techniques. Not that that's something that's easy to pick up on, so I may have just not noticed it, and if they've talked about it in interviews or something I'd be very interested in reading about what they're up to."
"Thantifaxath - Gasping in Darkness","Most classically trained musicians wouldn't be analyzing this kind of music, so I did it myself.  So I guess my source would be perfect pitch and 6 years of studying music in college."

I'm still working on getting my head around this album. I love those angular, serpentine melodies that they use, but there's a lot of it that my brain hasn't quite locked in on yet.

I wasn't trying to be antagonistic, by the way. I'm just inclined, based on my experience, not to automatically trust redditors to know what they're talking about with regards to music theory."

"Thantifaxath - Gasping in Darkness","A basic form is using each of the notes once before repeating any of them, this is done to achieve equal use of each of the notes and create truly atonal music.

tarnkek's comment reminded me that Jute Gyte has a greate example of this, but this wasn't done with the 24 tone guitar: [Jute Gyte - The Irreality of the Past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtbVOct1f84) 

Ehnahre is another band that toys with using tone rows, but not as directly as the above example.

I also didn't notice any on Sacred White Noise, but like brutishbloodgod said, it isn't always easy to just sit and notice these things. "

"The Ruins Of Beverast - Between Bronze Walls","""Between Bronze Walls"" and ""The Clockhand's Groaning Circles"" are easily two of my top favorite ~~Ruins Of Beverast~~ Black Metal songs.

"Nargaroth -the day burzum killed mayhem","**Lyrics**:

1993 a year of misery?

Darkness fills the sky.

I hear the warriors cry.

The legend tells a story

From a Viking from the north,

Who met a Death Warrior

Black Metal was never really the same.

The legend call it murder

And the Viking had survived.

But the eyes of the Death Warrior

Never saw again the sun upon the sky.

And the quintessence:

Everyone recognized war,

That Black Metal isn't just

Entertainment anymore.

I can still remember

My emotions so confused.

My soul was seeking answers.

No knife I let unused.

So many questions

I had to satisfy.

My soul was under torture,

But I knew my way was right

I see a cemetery fall asleep under fog

And I know the old days will never come

Again.

1993, this year of misery was the knife

which split the Black Metal scene apart.

Since that mighty day Black metal split his Way,

And the unity was never the same again.

Lies, rumors and hate. Moneymaking, sadness

And shame

And all this by, the Day as Burzum Killed Mayhem.

Remember this day! Remember this way!

That you never betray, what here leads you

On your way!

And I never will forget

The day as this both warriors met.

The blood was hot the moon was red

And Black Metal created his own grave.

And I dream from days before

Black Metal Maniacs, no whore,

In the legions of war

The demons in our heads the law.

So I summon you once again,

We should never forget the pain

From older days in our veins

We now cut of that it can flow like rain.

Arrghh, this was the legend from

The Day as Burzum killed Mayhem."

"Forgot Name of Acoustic Black Metal Band","Out of everything listed in the thread (besides impaled northern moonforest lol), the band I recall sounds most similar to Circle of Ouroborus mixed with Lonndom and Echtra but all at a much slower tempo and longer song lengths. If I ever find what I'm looking for, I'll definitely post it on here!"
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","I went to see Revenge, Watain, and Mayhem last night at Webster Hall in NYC. Wasn't really expecting much since I never was a big fan of Mayhem, and had never heard of Revenge - a Canadian band - and frankly didn't like them all that much anyway. I also mostly listen to more chilled out bm (e.g. Drudkh), most of whom are disbanded, dead, incarcerated, don't tour, or don't tour the US. But I really wanted to see a BM show. 

Watain took the stage and killed it. The front row definitely got hit with some red colored liquid - no idea what it was.  Put on a relatively long set and was definitely the highlight of the evening for me. 

Mayhem was pretty good, but just didn't live up to what what Watain put on, IMO. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","How can you not like revenge? What is it about revenge you don't like?"
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Considering he enjoys Watain's circus act I'm not surprised he doesn't like Revenge. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","that shit can be fun if you don't take it seriously. that idea is of course thrown out the door with Watain. "

"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Seeing this tour tonight. I read Mayhem was sans Necrobutcher yesterday, hopefully that's not the case tonight."
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Depends if he can get from the UK in time for the show tonight because that's where he's stuck now. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Ah, really? I thought that issue was resolved and all the members were in the US now. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Attila held it down well enough last night but I don't understand why the hell they had two guitarists instead of one dude playing bass. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","I was there last night, and I was up front for Watain. The ""red liquid"" was, in fact, pig's blood. It was salty and clotted in places. I got pretty soaked. 

And agreed, Mayhem was kinda boring after seeing what Watain put on. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","I can comfirm this. 
Pig's blood leaves a mess. It's kind of hard to remove from the barricades and speakers. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","One of those shows where the venue's security guys were definitely not psyched to be there."
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","They actally brought their own security for that show. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","iiiinteresting. I was talking to my buddy about how much it *costs* Watain to do a show with the crew they have. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","how much does it?

also, for pig's blood, i'd try throwing some oxi-clean on it.  it's in most of the cleansers that kennels and vet offices use for cleaning up after animals.  it also really helps get the cat piss smell out of clothes when my cat has a uti."
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Oh I have absolutely no idea, but it's probably not cheap. And thanks for the tip! Luckily I was wearing a waterproof jacket, so it came off pretty easily, with the added benefit of making it look like I murdered someone in my shower. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","I just misread that as ""bulletproof jacket"" ..."
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","well what do you think i was wearing *under* the waterproof jacket? I got all the proofs, man"
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Well. They won't show up without a crew, so..."
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Totally agree. I went for Watain and was not disappointed. It was my first black metal show. :P"
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Was there last night. Mayhem and Watain both put on great shows but I would've liked more Lawless Darkness &amp; De Mysteriis. I think I'll forever be butthurt I didn't get to hear Four Thrones &amp; Funeral Fog."
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Having seen Watain live three times now, I think they were off of their game last night. They usually bring a serious amount of passion and energy to the stage, but last night they didn't. 

As for the blood, they threw it into the audience exactly like they did it at Brooklyn Bazaar in June. Same music, same cues, same props. Back then, it was shocking and brutal, but last night it was just scripted. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","one of my friends saw rotten sound putting on their blood soaked butcher's clothes before a show.  they kept them in plastic garment bags."
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","I saw them in Baltimore on Friday, absolutely amazing show. Had a great time. Also Revenge was awesome!"
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","I did too and was severely disappointed they didn't encore or play longer to fill some of the time meant for mayhem"
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Honestly I was just happy to see them and Revenge, I couldn't care less about Mayhem to be honest. I like them and all but atillas style is not for me I think it would be sick if they got someone like hoest from Taake. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","I disagree but regardless a Friday night show that ended at 1030 is ridiculous. I wanted to hear legions of the black light too "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Man they played an hour and twenty minute set. I couldn't ask much more, most black metal bands couldn't pull that off if they tried."
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Really? It didnt feel that long. I guess its because they had so much energy til the end"
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","I missed my flight on thursday to come home and see them in Philly, but I heard really mixed reviews."
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Revenge absolutely crushed last night. Total violence. That new song was a ripper too. Riffs galore. 

That said, I dug Watain's performance especially when they busted out ""I Am the Earth"". Erik's vocals also held up consistently through the set. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Are you blowing black shit out of your nose? I've seen them twice and those candles are brutal. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","I'm going to try and make this show when it comes through.  I saw 1349 and felt the same way some of you do about Mayhem's performance.  They just seemed like they were going through the motions which bummed me out because I had been looking forward to setting them for years.  Mayhem was bsdass last time I saw them."
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Seeing them later thid month. So excited."
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","I'm seeing them in Toronto on Tuesday, cannot wait!

I listened to Watain's setlist online (the album versions obviously) and I'm really looking forward to them now"
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Uhhh I'm struggling with not going to this show because it's about 6 hours away and money but damn that review really makes me want to."
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Is Necrobutcher playing with Mayhem? I heard some issues about his visa. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","No, Necro wasn't there on saturday. "
"Watain was fucking awesome last night","Seeing them in Lawrence. I hope Mayhem isn't as dull as what everyone is saying. I really liked Esoteric Warfare!"

"Watain was fucking awesome last night","watain is kinda overproduced on record, but they're better live.  i still think their live drum sound is too clear though.

i went because i like early mayhem, i thought current mayhem blew, and i walked out with newfound respect for watain."

"Audio Quality","What are the overall opinions of well produced black metal? How does this group feel about bands like Fallujah? Bands that incorporate ideas heavily influenced by black metal. "
"Audio Quality","Sorry, but if you're trying to use Fallujah as an example of black metal fans being kvlt elitist assholes who hate sound quality, you're a bit off the mark. 


Fallujah is some terrible technical deathcore band and is definitely pretty far from what black metal fans would listen to as far as acceptable music. Terrible bands have been incorporating black metal sounds for decades now, so I don't think a band like this would phase us. 


We don't have a problem with good sound quality. We just don't need it to appreciate the music. "
"Audio Quality","No, not trying to use fallujah in any example other than their sound quality. And i'm getting all the answers i'm looking for. Also there are no assumptions here about how elitist any of you are. 
"
"Audio Quality","No problem, dude. Plenty of people in shreddit love using straw man arguments for hating on ""elitists"" here to justify to themselves for not exploring new bands or new music. It's always nice to see metal fans out there that are not like that. "
"Audio Quality","Word! The silly thing about the elitists is that the bands they listen to probably pull inspiration from other bands. such a weird concept lol"
"Audio Quality","""heavily influenced by black metal"" isn't black metal."
"Audio Quality","It was an overarching statement. More simply, production quality of fallujahs ""Flesh Prevails"", being in black metal."
"Audio Quality","I feel like Fallujah is far from a black metal band. Whether or not they are good is subjective and up to you.

I think there is merit to both poorly produced lofi metal and well produced black metal. Production matters less to me than the music itself "
"Audio Quality","A short, simple and well put response. Thank you. This is what I was looking for. 
"
"Audio Quality","I think it's important here to differentiate between ""good"" production and ""smooth"" production. For example, I think Tentacles of Whorror is really well produced, but the production is anything but smooth.

I think that this sub draws the line at around the level of *The Satanist* by Behemoth - stuff like Fallujah isn't particularly black metal, but there's a bunch of black/death (Ascension, Aosoth, etc) posted here."
"Audio Quality","No Fallujah is NOT black metal. They simply implement elements of the genre and I was using them to reference their quality of sound. Was trying to avoid using Behemoths ""The Satanist"" for an example so that the post didn't get flagged. Love that album though
"
"Audio Quality","I didn't think you were stating that Fallujah *were* black metal. However, I think it's still important to note that for black metal, the quality of production isn't necessarily linked directly a ""nice"" sound.

Personally, I think that there's some fantastic black metal out there with less kvlt-sounding but still great production: Blut Aus Nord's latest album springs to mind, as does recent Marduk and Altar of Plagues. On the other end of spectrum, there's Bone Awl, which sounds like it was recorded using a tin can and yet is some of the best raw black metal out there.

edit: spelling"
"Audio Quality","i dont even know what fallujah is.
But for me mastering and overall audio quality is really important. But we all know that there are masterpieces there were recorded in basement/garage/toilet and you know what? Good music will always be good music, "
"Audio Quality","agreed"
"Audio Quality","I love a lot of different kinds of black metal, some lofi, some ""over produced"", and some with one mic shitty demo quality, but I also love other types of metal that rely on good production, like BTBAM or Opeth. I think low production quality, on purpose or not, adds to the abrasive manor of certain BM, like Darkthrone or Leviathan, while bands like Wolves in the throne room have higher quality, mostly because there is more layering going on. "

"Liturgy put out a new song...","I usually stick up for Liturgy a lot more than most people I know in the scene do, and I really enjoyed most of their work (I liked Renihilation and their split with Oval and I liked a couple songs on Aesthetica) but [this song's total wank](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebxIwwhV5MA). Their new album is coming out in March and to be completely honest I went from being slightly excited for it to not giving a shit. 

I don't know if there's much of a discussion worth talking about here because I'm not sure if there's any more discussion worth having about it, but if there is anyone around who enjoyed this new song, please help me out, I'm not getting it."
"Liturgy put out a new song...","It's not really black metal, but I thought it was pretty great. The vocals were pretty bland to me on this track, but Liturgy's music in general seems to have a ton of energy to it, and somehow manages to be grandiose but also minimal. I'm a big fan of experimentation, and I don't really understand why Liturgy makes people so *mad*. I would much rather listen to something that takes risks, even if it fails every once in a while, than some generic black metal band that sounds just like everything else. "
"Liturgy put out a new song...","&gt;I don't really understand why Liturgy makes people so mad


I'm not speaking for myself necessarily, but I imagine a good amount of Liturgy's criticism originates from HHH's ""transcendental black metal"" manifesto.
"
"Liturgy put out a new song...","I like the song too, even the vocals. the rhythmic pattern and monotonal nature fit the track pretty well imo. I love seeing BM spreading into other genres (one of my favorite albums of 2014 was [Lantlos' ""Melting Sun""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFJSM3kvBQ4)), but seeing how much hate his ""manifesto"" got him, I'm not surprised to see them moving away from it. I totally agree with you. I don't want to hear the same album every time someone puts out something new."
"Liturgy put out a new song...","New Liturgy is fucking garbage, alert the press."
"Liturgy put out a new song...","Interesting song, don't hear much black metal in it though.  I'll give the album a shot.  Renihilation is an absolute masterpiece so they've earned a few more albums worth of listens from me."
"Liturgy put out a new song...","I don't even think that's metal."
"Liturgy put out a new song...","to me it sounds like liturgy was trying to play some weird form of electro pop. some of the melodies and harmonies were neat but the vocals kind of put me off. it sounds like MGMT trying to play black metal."
"Liturgy put out a new song...","I felt the same way at first, but a couple of listens later had me feeling better about the mumbling voice (which was pretty much the only problem I had with it at first). I do have some interesting black metal if you're interested http://youtu.be/_B2zLiZHOsQ"
"Liturgy put out a new song...","Those riffs are nearly perfect."
"Liturgy put out a new song...","[deleted]"
"Liturgy put out a new song...","Ok, *now* they're really trying to annoy people. 

Before it was questionable, but considering HHH isn't blind to the negative reception to him, his music and his shitty pretentious black metal manifesto, this guy is stirring the shit for pleasure and adding spice."
"Liturgy put out a new song...","Liturgy has always received a bad rap and honestly I could not give a fuck less. This is gorgeous and strange. Maybe it's not black metal, stylistically it only holds true to the genre through tremolo-picking, but it is something new and honest and heartbreaking. I'm not sure what else there is to look for in music. I refuse to be considered an apologist when there are no apologies to be made, because not having to apologize is one of the reasons I got into black metal in the first place."
"Liturgy put out a new song...","The vocals are still weird to me, I think it's just the youtube compression, but I really like what they're trying to do. They seem to be going for the hypnotic, edge of climax effect they had on their previous album which I really enjoyed. I'll be interested in what the finished album sounds like, even though it's not black metal."
"Liturgy put out a new song...","&gt;I'm not sure what else there is to look for in music.

Some people are looking for good riffs and songwriting. Not something ""new"" and ""experimental."""

"Liturgy put out a new song...","I like to keep an open mind about black metal (hell, I even liked some of Aesthetica), but this song was just SO terrible.

If i'm going to listen to hipstery black metal, I'll put on Altar of Plagues or Deafheaven, not this garbage."
"Liturgy put out a new song...","Completely disagree on Altar of Plagues. Sorry."
"Liturgy put out a new song...","What do you mean by that? "
"Liturgy put out a new song...","While Altar of Plagues did see a decent fanbase, they in no way were creating music with a goal of cashing in off of a trend or making a record label happy. They did what they wanted, when they wanted. I see a lot of arguments online where people also say that Teethed Glory and Injury was trying to cater to that kind of crowd, but I don't agree. At all, actually. If you listen the whole way back in their discography to their Through the Cracks of the Earth demo, James always showed a liking for electronics in their music. All of the sudden, in this post-Deafheaven hipster resurgence, blah, blah, whatever world, TGaI is for some reason looked down upon when, in my mind, it was their most accomplished piece of work. 




The nail in the coffin on that argument, though? Do two Google searches. On one, pretend that you're shopping for a Deafheaven t-shirt, and the other, an Altar of Plagues t-shirt. 



Altar of Plagues did things on their own terms. Altar of Plagues was in the business of making art. 



Deafheaven are peddling their wares on any online distro that will have them. Deafheaven is in the business of making money. Bottom line.




But hey, at least we can both agree: Liturgy is trash."
"Liturgy put out a new song...","Well said! I've always staunchly argued that Altar of Plagues were better at what the mainstream press claimed Deafheaven were doing, but with Teethed Glory they really moved in their own direction. It makes sense that they broke up and James picked up Wife after its release."

Not as frequently updated, but has a nice focus on underground acts and is predominantly black metal.

It sounds like lurker at a lot of points - did he recycle some unreleased lurker stuff?"
"New Leviathan album ""Scar Sighted"" now streaming.","More than likely. I know he has at least 5 unreleased LoC albums. Apparently we'll finally get to hear some this year."
"New Leviathan album ""Scar Sighted"" now streaming.","This album is outstanding. Off one listen it's already shot up to my favorite release of the year."

This sounds nothing like what he's done before. Amazing from start to finish"
"New Leviathan album ""Scar Sighted"" now streaming.","Step in the right direction for him, his last couple releases weren't doing it for me. Also, he throws in some Lurker-esc vocals and that's always a good thing"

"New Leviathan album ""Scar Sighted"" now streaming.","Oh solid. I'm actually seriously considering that as a career path. I have a great job now with a local campus but that...culture, is distasteful. Off topic, but any tips on purusing that? If you dont want to discuss it, you're welcome to tell me to fuck off.  "
"New Leviathan album ""Scar Sighted"" now streaming.","Fuck off! 

Haha but no really if you want to get into it the first thing I'd recommend is getting in a black suit and a nice tie and go sound to different funeral homes until one of them hires you part time. Try and get to work services, maybe do removals and run DCs. Really just get the most basic feel for it and talk to the directors/managers as much as possible while you're there about the job.

 I recommend doing this before wasting money/time in school. Find out if you would even enjoy doing the job before committing. The job can be fun, but if it's not a good fit it's miserable."
"New Leviathan album ""Scar Sighted"" now streaming.","Awesome man, thanks! I didn't even think to start with part time work directly from the homes. "
"New Leviathan album ""Scar Sighted"" now streaming.","requiem for a turd world was one of my favorites on it anyway.

Related to thread, is this album pirated out yet? I can't find it."
"New Leviathan album ""Scar Sighted"" now streaming.","Its on spotify. Jeff is one of those few artists I choose to support monetarily, so I'm not going to hit you up with a direct link but I found it yesterday on my usual hunt. "
"New Leviathan album ""Scar Sighted"" now streaming.","I was going to too until I found out he has a wife and kid.   No problem, I'll find it eventually."
"New Leviathan album ""Scar Sighted"" now streaming.","This is head-smashingly good. "
"New Leviathan album ""Scar Sighted"" now streaming.","I love the album but I hate the 'samples' (I don't know if they're actually sampled, but I'm just referring to clips of clean speech like ""big fucking things that crawls"" on the smoke of their torment.

This is coming from someone for whom the samples on Lurker of Chalice could not be more perfect (Gregory Peck's speech from (edit: Omen, not Exorcist), the 'desecration of christ' line from Exorcist: The Beginning, Gwyneth Paltrow's speech from ""Sylvia."")

It's distressing to have something so minor spoiling an otherwise amazing album."
"New Leviathan album ""Scar Sighted"" now streaming.","""Every fucking thing that crawls, is going to pay."" I am in minor agreement here. They are scattered everywhere and they detract, but it's not enough to spoil it for me. However, I do like when he says ""The smoke of their torment shall ascend forever and ever and they shall have no rest day or night! You shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God. You shall be tormented with fire in the presence of the Lamb! Nay, we worship the beast!"" "

&gt; Valis is the first proper Mastery full-length and the most extreme record The Flenser has ever released. As its name and sigil demands, Mastery is a vessel to ascend the partial mind; one impulsive and chaotic, the other of collected illumination. A meditation unto the will subconscious. The solo black metal entity is the product of mastermind Ephemeral Domignostika (Pale Chalice, Pandiscordian Necrogenesis, Horn of Dagoth). Once a follower in the tradition of fellow Bay Area acts Leviathan, Crebain and Weakling, Mastery has evolved into something more. Valis is like a form of free jazz black metal—twisted and complex, with upwards of 100 riffs per song. Eschewing traditional songwriting and conceptual forms, Domignostika creates through spontaneous composition, cut ups and free performance. His extremely unique guitar style, polyrhythmic drum patterns and urgent vocal delivery bely the fact that Valis is the work of one person playing everything with the utmost intentionality. Mastery has previously released five extremely limited (and long sold out) demos since 2004, a collection on the tUMULt label in 2011 titled Barbaric Usurpation of the Hypereonic Black Metal Throne, and split albums with with Skullflower and Palace of Worms. “One can only assume that Mastery mastermind Ephemeral Domignostika is an extremely dangerous career sociopath after being subjected to this spastic sonic evisceration; either that or a deeply disturbed black metal savant.” —That’s How Kids Die “Mastery is total berzerker black metal, rooted in the tradition of true grim blackness, but filtered through Mastery’s cracked perception, transforming this into something beyond true; a droned out and damaged, outsider blackness, that sounds pretty much unlike almost any other black metal.” —Aquarius

Did Quorthon ever mention norwegian bm anywhere? I am really curious about what his stance was on this matter.

If anyone knows better, don't be shy share some info.

Thanks."
"What did Quorthon think of the Norwegian BM Scene?","In the last interview of Quorthon that I could find, he says this.  While it's not so explicit, I don't think he was really paying attention to a lot of the scene itself as much as fans' reactions to him and his work.

&gt; CROMCarl: It would have been, yeah. I guess that leads me to the next thing: how do you feel about the bands that almost sound identical to early Bathory, the Norwegian stuff that’s been coming out for a while? It’s almost like you’re a direct influence into it, as far as musically. How do you feel about that whole situation in general?

&gt;Quorthon: Well, I don’t know what kinda piece shit music to be influenced by, cause, you know, I mean, the first 3 or 4 Bathory albums, you know, they’re not even listenable. I mean, we’re terrible musicians, we didn’t have a clue, uuhhm, our English was fucked up, still is probably. But I mean, listen to even the first couple Bathory albums, the first Slayer albums; the first album of Celtic Frost, and the first album of Bathory—it’s all crap. But, I mean, it fitted in with certain, you know, it filled the gap, and a lot of people out there in the underground scene during the early 80s felt: “Well, this is our music.” They felt, you know, sorta like estranged from Saxon, Iron Maiden, and Van Halen, and all of those other bands. So this is a new kind of music formula, or metal formula, and, I mean, when we started, all of us, I mean, I’m not just talking about Bathory, there were no such things as double bass drums and, you know, just the way we sounded when we would sing our material, I mean, that particular black metal vocals, we had to learn all that all ourselves when black metal was formed. I mean, today, when they grow up, I mean, kids in the age of 14-15, you know, they’re experts playing double bass drums—they can play as fast as they want. But in those days, there were no such thing around. The first time I ever in my entire life heard double bass drums was Motorhead “Overkill”, and by that time, I thought that was the fastest thing I’ve heard in my entire life. All of the songs basically on the first album of Bathory is twice as fast as “Overkill”, and today we hear stuff that is so incredibly fast you cannot believe how fast these kids can play. Of course, if copying or being influenced by, it’s flattering in one way, and it’s also a reassurance that, you know, black metal will continue, because it does fill a certain gap: you need the extreme in order to get perspective on a lot of other things. I mean, if you can have all these crossover combinations, you know, with alternative pop, and, you know, vegetarian lesbian military front whatever kinda shit pigshit music right now they’re playing and calling it “metal.” It’s good, I mean, a lot of people are buying all these records, and some people refer to it as “metal”, whereas the kids, you know, they walk up on stage in these checkered shirts and, you know, eating a carrot, a saying “viva la religion”, and stuff like that, and people saying, I mean, people who are not into metal, they will not take it as metal, but it’s still metal. I mean, it’s heavy guitar-based music, which is good. 

&gt; CROMCarl: Right.

&gt;Quorthon: Black Metal is a part of that. It’s a very extreme image and all of that, but, uhm, we all go through a certain stage in our life, when we have green hair or safety pins, or studded black leather underwear or whatever (laughs)

"What did Quorthon think of the Norwegian BM Scene?","That was very interesting. It's funny how critical Quorthon is of the first bathory album seeing as it's so loved"
"What did Quorthon think of the Norwegian BM Scene?","He bullshitted a lot in interviews, so it's hard to take him too seriously from one interview to the next. I do know that he mentioned more than once his dislike for Under The Sign..., he was pretty consistent with that. Slayer Magazine had some good interviews with him, and there was a decent Metal Maniacs interview with him in 1996 or so, those are pretty decent ones to check out."

"The Blackest List.","Well, the time is upon us. Some of you have longed for it, others have dreaded it; to some of you this is coming out of the blue. Uniting you all, however, is your obligation to abide it: the /r/blackmetal blacklist. The deciding factors are two, and they are as simple as can be: if it's a black metal band and it has more than 100,000 listeners on [last.fm](http://www.last.fm), posting their songs are hereby forbidden.* The list is dynamic and subject to change without warning at any time.

The reason? It should be obvious enough, but in the interest of thoroughness I'll spell it out: posting eminent mainstays of the genre adds nothing to the community. As you'll notice if you peruse past posts, songs by the likes of Bathory, Mayhem, Darkthrone, etc. will receive a large number (30+) of upvotes, and will often receive zero comments, or if they do, they will be fluff like ""classic!"" or something similarly vacuous. This community was never intended to be a museum of black metal, nor even an archive. Its purpose is the elucidation of the darker regions of the genre where those with a pre-existing familiarity with it can share and interact with like cohorts. For newcomers to black metal, the blacklist will serve the dual purpose of a gateway to the genre, much as /r/metal 's does for that community. 

The list will be officially added to the sidebar shortly, but in the meantime it comprises the following bands:

Mayhem


Emperor


Darkthrone


Immortal


Burzum

Feel free to use the comment section to:

* Bemoan the fascist mods

* Make suggestions -- as in, of bands to add to the list

* Make your case against the instatement of the list, which as you might surmise, will be of little consequence

* Grumble amongst yourselves.

"The Blackest List.","I think this is a good idea. I'm here for learning about new, obscure black metal bands, and I think many others are here for the same reason, not to see the stuff we've listened to years posted.

Essentially, I see music subreddits as places for discovery and not places for repetition. "
"The Blackest List.","glad you feel that way, that is this sub's intended purpose"
"The Blackest List.","Guilty of posting many of these bands many times, will take this into consideration"
"The Blackest List.","I do enjoy your posts though"
"The Blackest List.","Thank you, glad you enjoy them, and I appreciate all the excellent comments as well, Cheers!"
"The Blackest List.","Nobody gives a shit about Samael. If this list serves as dual purpose to inform the rookies about BM then surely Taake and Satanic Warmaster should be on that list. I mean Taake has been posted about 40 fucking times. 

Over the past year and a bit I've been chilling here I've noticed these bands get posted a lot and are big karma whores. If you want to go hogwild add these to the list: Drudkh, Watain, WiTTR, Peste Noire, Windir, Mgla, Leviathan, Paysage d'Hiver, Altar of Plagues,  Blut Aus Nord, Urfaust, Woods of Desolation, Darkspace and Xasthur

Cradle of Filth is so garbage they should just ban whoever posts it and leave it off the list."
"The Blackest List.","if i were the sole mod things would be much harsher, but i'm not, so certain moderation procedures need to be followed. thanks for the input though.
"
"The Blackest List.","Taake should be at the top of the fucking list, much as I love him."
"The Blackest List.","Taake deserves to be on there, I agree."
"The Blackest List.","While I think some of that list definitely fits a lot of it is ~10 upvote sort of stuff."
"The Blackest List.","I couldn't agree more with you about Cradle of Filth. As for the rest, take it in steps. See this as the first phase.

But yeah, I make a motion to delete the Internet connection of anyone who posts CoF. I wouldn't be surprised to hear that they were covering Nickelback or vice versa."
"The Blackest List.","You must've made a typo, you put wittr on a list with bm bands."
"The Blackest List.","&gt;be checking out a band/album

&gt;good song catches attention

&gt;think r/BlackMetal might enjoy

&gt;SEARCH to see if song has been previously posted

&gt;it hasn't? share to the brethren. 

It's not rocket science and it should be common sense but this should help. Though, I'm selfishly sad to see Summoning go because there is no such thing as too much Summoning."
"The Blackest List.","common sense ain't too common"
"The Blackest List.","Great idea! Watain, maybe?"
"The Blackest List.","theyre just below the threshold currently"
"The Blackest List.","Good"
"The Blackest List.","I think Shining only has 100,000 listeners because there are two bands with that name. "
"The Blackest List.","i considered that and i find it unlikely that the other shining has over 20k listeners.
"
"The Blackest List.","""Blackjazz"" alone has 25,000 listeners. So, they absolutely do."
"The Blackest List.","*shrug*

close enough."
"The Blackest List.","I wonder how many of those ""fans"" think they are the same band. My guess, more than zero."
"The Blackest List.","[deleted]"
"The Blackest List.","Expected to see Blut Aus Nord, Drudkh, and The Ruins of Beverast. This is a great idea, though! "
"The Blackest List.","they all have less than 100k listeners. i wanted to adhere to some kind of concrete rubric, and for now i am doing so"
"The Blackest List.","Yeah, what I meant was that I expected them to be over that listen limit. The cap is a good rule of thumb. "
"The Blackest List.","You should ban Drudkh, it's on here often enough."
"The Blackest List.","i'm trying to limit the arbitrariness of what is and isnt allowed, though i do share the sentiment"
"The Blackest List.","Fair enough. 

I appreciate this anyway, more music subs need to enforce rules like this."
"The Blackest List.","[It's time](http://www.last.fm/music/Wolves+in+the+Throne+Room?ac=wolves).  "
"The Blackest List.","Boom! Thank you."
"The Blackest List.","I see Taake on here waaaay too much"
"The Blackest List.","for now i'm going by the hard and fast &gt;100k listeners rule, but i may adjust that in the future"
"The Blackest List.","Thats a good place to start!"
"The Blackest List.","cheers"
"The Blackest List.","This is a good idea but I can't help but feel offended about a Darkthrone ban."
"The Blackest List.","Agree 100% with this, full support."
"The Blackest List.","Arcturus has 124K listeners."
"The Blackest List.","true. i must've forgotten that they were even a bm band at one point"
"The Blackest List.","The truest of the Norwegian kings."
"The Blackest List.","I think the blacklist is similar in vein to the /r/metal one. It's a great starting point for someone to take a trip down the dark path."
"The Blackest List.","I support this.

Also, the inclusion of Alcest amuses me. 

edit: I wouldn't mind seeing Deathspell Omega added."
"The Blackest List.","cant trust you slippery bastards. but as you're undoubtedly aware, they did play bm for a minute or two"
"The Blackest List.","I suppose that's a good enough reason. Perhaps then Deafheaven should be on there? 

I'm pretty sure Wikipedia lists them as a black metal band...and I'm pretty sure anyone with a functioning eyeball and a modem has heard of them by now. Probably twice."
"The Blackest List.","i didnt want to dignify their existence. maybe at a later date someone will force my hand"
"The Blackest List.","They're still under the threshold."
"The Blackest List.","I find the inclusion of Alcest funny as well"
"The Blackest List.","they used to play black metal and have been posted numerous times to circlejerk-levels of upvotes. ha ha ha."
"The Blackest List.","Makes sense"
"The Blackest List.","What's so funny about it? They're frequently posted."
"The Blackest List.","1. What about a ""common"" band, such as Drudkh, but a rare song?

2. Regarding Marduk: If someone finds a live performance of ""Baptism of Fire"" with good sound quality, I want to hear it (the album version is slower and unexciting).  How could it get posted despite the blacklist?

3. If the majority of people here don't want Mayhem stuff, why don't they downvote it instead of upvoting?

4. I agree with blacklisting Cradle of Filth for obvious reasons.  Gorgoroth, Satyricon, Immortal, Dimmu Borgir, Enslaved, Behemoth and Dark Funeral are boring to listen to."
"The Blackest List.","Not a mod, obviously, but here's my two cents on your first and third questions:

Question 1: Drudkh isn't on the blacklist, so they can still be posted.  As for the deep cuts from a popular band part, nothing from a well-known band is really that obscure anymore as a result of the internet.  Because of YouTube, it's about as easy to find lesser-known tracks from the biggest bands as it is to find their most popular songs.  It's much more difficult to find a good obscure band.  Also, if deep cuts from popular bands were allowed, you'd just have ""My Journey to the Stars"" zooming to the top of the front page instead of ""Dunkelheit.""

Question 3: Subreddits aren't necessarily democratic, and this is an effort by the mods to make this one closer to their ideal.  Also, in any subreddit with thousands of users, two groups generally emerge: people who contribute, and people who lurk and vote.  I don't think you'll see seventy unique users post content here even over a period as long as a month, but you'll see seventy people vote on a given well-known submission.  I think the mods would rather have this sub cater to people who actively participate, rather than to silent users who (I'm guessing) vote mainly on the basis of recognition."
"The Blackest List.","&gt;Subreddits aren't necessarily democratic, and this is an effort by the mods to make this one closer to their ideal.

[Considering the crap that results in radio with asking ""what do the majority want to listen to?"" instead of using a single radio DJ's vision and extensive collection](http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1mbcd8/table_i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything/), that's a very good point for a music subreddit.  In the parlance of that radio executive's AMA, the idea iis to make /r/BlackMetal be like having a bunch of DJs who bring you obscure stuff, not ""the newest top hit that most people in this demographic want to listen to.""  When it becomes focus-group, majority-rule, the result is music that nobody really likes."
"The Blackest List.","This is exactly my vision of the sub, thank you for putting it into words."
"The Blackest List.","^ I'm glad to hear any pessimism I had about /r/BlackMetal devolving into an e621-style dramafest was unfounded.  There won't be a bunch of Mayhem and melodic shit to pick through now and that makes me happy."
"The Blackest List.","what he said."
"The Blackest List.","also, fuck drudkh for their nsbm ties."
"The Blackest List.","It has been two weeks, and the quality of posts has risen significantly.  Now I can stop seeing Ulver and Dimmu Borgir on here every fucking day."
"The Blackest List.","I completely agree with this. It should help to limit any circle-jerking in the sub."
"The Blackest List.","that's the aim"
"The Blackest List.","I agree this is a good idea. I don't want to nod my head to releases I've already listened to, but want to find new music.

I think Windir and Peste Noire should be added, too."
"The Blackest List.","they were considered but failed to meet the second of the two criteria."
"The Blackest List.","Ah, I don't use last.fm, but I've noticed that windir seems to float up quite a bit, and checked all time top posts and for which peste noire shows up twice in the top 50."
"The Blackest List.","while it obviously doesn't give a 1:1 representation of global listening habits, it is the best tool i know of for estimating the popularity of any given band, which is why it was chosen."
"The Blackest List.","Windir should be one this list "
"The Blackest List.","Nice. I don't come to reddit to see a bunch of bands I already listen to all the time. Glad you left Solefald off the list, because I will spam them all day long."
"The Blackest List.","yea good luck with that"
"The Blackest List.","I hope you do. We need more bands like Solefald that deviate from the norm. "
"The Blackest List.","Personally, a few of the bands in the blackest list aren't quite 'obscure' enough to be excluded, in my opinion. Some Black Metallers haven't heard of stuff like Borknagar, Arcturus, Old Man's Child, Samael, Summoning and Shining."
"The Blackest List.","I actually found Shining recently when looking for the other Shining, from Sweden. They're not black metal, but a jazz outfit that put out an album called Blackjazz, inspired by black metal. It's the guy who's been doing sax for Ihsahn. I haven't been able to get into it; just felt like talking about it."
"The Blackest List.","the 'some people haven't heard ____' argument holds no water in this context; each band has a listenership over 100k which is the only criterion that needs to be met other than the obvious one of being or having been a bm band."
"The Blackest List.","Plus if people haven't heard it, they can just look at this list, and research on their own. I hadn't heard of Borknagar until about five minutes ago. =p"
"The Blackest List.","I am 100% for this. "
"The Blackest List.","I support this 100%. "
"The Blackest List.","Good idea. Not sure why people post these bands in the first place. Many great bands on the black list, but come on. Who isn't already overly familiar with them? The point of the subreddit, if I'm not mistaken, is not to say, ""remember this one and this one and this one and this one? You know, the ones you've already heard? Look! I found more!"" "
"The Blackest List.","ex. act. ly."
"The Blackest List.","Awesome! WITTR has under 100k. Spam time! [/sarcasm]"
"The Blackest List.","Good. Dimmu Burger is banned."
"The Blackest List.","God damn. About fucking time. Too much garbage gets posted here, that list, the rule about lastfm listeners is perfect. I welcome this change with open arms. Hopefully some of the easymode posters will leave for brighter places. "
"The Blackest List.","I agree with most of this list except for cradle, dimmu, dark funeral and agalloch.  I love agollach and dark funeral but I don't really think they fall into the blackest category.  Dimmu is Dimmu...."
"The Blackest List.","Also add panopticon and nokturnal mortum.  And id be happy "
"The Blackest List.","Mistook the purpose of this thread.  Disregard my precious comments.  Lol "

"The Blackest List.","Temnozor may be classified as NSBM (they were a key part of the BlazeBirth Hall scene), but I think [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMetal/comments/20y32h/temnozor_white_thunder_roars/) is technically folk metal, with few black elements other than raw production."
"The Blackest List.","[deleted]"
"The Blackest List.","Shouldn't Sodom be in the list?"
"The Blackest List.","Should Destruction?"
"The Blackest List.","Will there be (plans to make) another BM subreddit for the discussion of these bands, for those of us whose black metal palette is limited to the more well-known bands of the genre, or no?"
"The Blackest List.","[deleted]"
"The Blackest List.","I agree with the idea. I think the concept of a blacklist banning just songs sort of clashes with the whole reddit model - it makes it hard to talk about these bands. Darkthrone and Burzum really are classics."
"The Blackest List.","yeah, but everyone has already heard them.  maybe a period of grace after a new album for that material?"
"The Blackest List.","Can something be done about the continued Mgla posts for karma whoring. Everybody knows of the band now so there is no need to see yet another track of theirs posted every other day. Don't get me wrong, Mgla are great; this is getting silly, however."
"The Blackest List.","Belphegor probably needs to be added there."
"The Blackest List.","Borknagar has over 100k listeners but watain and wolves in the throne room do not? That is crazy.  Hail I.C.S. Vortex!

"The Blackest List.","I'm very glad for this, sick of everyone posting the same overrated band over and over again (not saying they aren't good). Thank you PenetratorHammer!"

"The Blackest List.","[deleted]"
"The Blackest List.","Good. "
"The Blackest List.","I've never heard of Samael, why are they on the list (alternatively I'm just a false)?

Any good?"
"The Blackest List.","They started off in a [seemingly](http://youtu.be/hOEsiOwodTY) good direction, but then after their third album turned into this industrial inspired stuff. I remember [this song](http://youtu.be/AtlnsjVDV4c) was played constantly on Much Music in Canada in the mid 90s. I have no idea what they are doing now, but nobody posts it here."
"The Blackest List.","What's wrong with a little Industrial thrown in? (Or is it like a really heavy Industrial influence?  Which is bad)

Edit: I don't listen to much Samael for clarification"
"The Blackest List.","There is nothing inherently wrong with it. I was just summarizing who they are to my knowledge. I can't see the people here being excited to post [this stuff](http://youtu.be/aMzWysnhr5c) is my point."
"The Blackest List.","If you want an example of good industrial metal, try Axis of Perdition. The Ichneumon Method is incredible. For bad, modern Samael."
"The Blackest List.","What do you think of Aborym?"
"The Blackest List.","You could google them and decide for yourself. "
"The Blackest List.","Samael was in the first wave, and was one very early band (who would rise to fame on the scene) to adopt this genre. What further makes them something of an oddity is that they are far removed from the physical scenes where this development was mostly centered. 

Their early stuff is very good if you like the raw, unpolished sound of someone taking a chainsaw to a barbed wire.

I jest -- it's not that bad, but I've lost my taste for 1st wave BM. Samael is a quality band nonetheless, though.

As others have said, they spent the 90s and most of 2000s making industrial metal, but they have a recent album which goes back *towards* their BM roots... without actually reaching it. Their 2 most recent albums are really more... industrial metal, I suppose. Dark industrial metal, if that's an appropriate categorization. Not blackened, just... with traces of extreme metal in the sound.

I like industrial metal as well as various genres of black metal, so in my book Samael is 10/10."
"The Blackest List.","I had never heard of them before, either.  They're on the list because they have more than one hundred thousand listeners on Last.fm.  I'm guessing they're pretty bad."
"The Blackest List.","Inquisition, bro"
"The Blackest List.","They have like 32k listeners."
"The Blackest List.","If you've never heard of them, you should give ""Ominous Doctrines of the Perpetual Mystical Macrocosm"" a listen.  Inquisition is heavy as fuck.  \m/"
"The Blackest List.","But what about if a band for example like Cradle of Filth has a rare fucking demo tape that fell in the unknown obscurity of history. Would that be okay to show? Or refer to list and NO."
"The Blackest List.","[This is going to be good](http://i.imgur.com/1MPxY.gif)."
"The Blackest List.","V-E-N-O-M"
"The Blackest List.","isn't black metal"
"The Blackest List.","So you can present to me evidence that the first 3 Venom records didn't feature satanic lyrics, blast beats and gutteral vocals? Didn't think so. Go listen to Burzum you hipster. Posers like you are killing Black Metal. "
"The Blackest List.","ha ha ha. 

implying lyrics define genre

implying ""gutteral"" vocals are a defining characteristic of bm

implying i haven't forgotten more black metal than you'll ever know

what i'm most baffled by though is where you heard blast beats in venom. 

do go on."
"The Blackest List.","...wow....just....wow."
"The Blackest List.","&gt; implying lyrics define genre 
&gt;
&gt; implying ""gutteral"" vocals are a defining characteristic of bm

Look up. In the sky. See that? It's the big picture flying over your head.

"
"The Blackest List.","And what's your point, my trite little friend? That because Venom are generally recognized as one of the main founders of black metal by virtue of their coining the term, that they should be grandfathered into the genre, despite the fact that they play NWOBHM/speed metal? 

Not on my watch, bud!"
"The Blackest List.","&gt; That because Venom are generally recognized as one of the main 
&gt; founders of black metal by virtue of their coining the term, that they should be grandfathered into the genre, despite the fact that they play NWOBHM/speed metal? 

Do you mock me, sir?

You were doing so well up until that last clause. Most ironic is you sound too clever to be restrained by narrow-minded genre snobbery better left to mallcore kiddies. You'd probably say Black Sabbath weren't metal, either.

In any event, yes. You stated my argument all on your own and saved me the trouble. How can I not upvote?"
"The Blackest List.","Narrow-minded? Quite the opposite; I put a lot of thought into how best to classify bands. 

Now, Venom were one of the very first metal bands with an over-the-top Satanic image, which without question influenced many, many later black metal bands. But, they play NWOBHM/speed metal, and they happen to sing about Satan and such. However, lyrical content does not determine genre. 

Many people seem to labor under the same delusion regarding Mercyful Fate, a heavy metal band also with a strong Satanic aesthetic. Nor does KD's popularization of corpse paint qualify MF as a black metal band.

In each case, if the instrumentals remained identical, but the lyrical and aesthetic content were changed, say to fantasy or sci-fi or take-your-pick, no one would regard them as black metal. However, if we applied similar changes to say, *Under the Sign of the Black Mark* no one could make an argument against its still being a black metal record. 

And regarding the Black Sabbath comment, don't be obtuse. "
"The Blackest List.","[deleted]"
"The Blackest List.","O, King of the Backhanded Retort:

Lyrical content does not define genre. Aesthetic does, of which lyrics are a part. In that sense, Venom are most definitely black metal, even if ""nominally."" Otherwise, by your definition, Dead-era Mayhem is not black metal either, nor are the MC5 punk.

Metal genre, to me, is not determined by examining riffs. It's fluid and depends on context. If I were hanging out with friends and said, ""Hey, put on some black metal"" and they threw on Venom, I'd probably have to adjust my expectations. It's not the sound that comes to mind when I think of bm. However, in the historical context of this list, yes, they're definitely black metal, sire."
"The Blackest List.","Umm pretty sure Venom didn't use blast beats..."
"The Blackest List.","&gt;Go listen to Burzum you hipster.

The fuck?"
"The Blackest List.","Yeh, was gonna ask why Venom wasn't on that list."
"The Blackest List.","Would love to never see Wolves in the throne room, blut aus nord, alcest, altar of plagues and all other ""shoegaze""/post black metal bullshit in this sub anymore. Also anyone that posts deafheavens should probably be banned..."
"The Blackest List.","I think that Endless Dismal Moan, Sigh, Silencer, Black Funeral, Kroda, Mgla, Nihill, and Xasthur are all great Black Metal bands. I know they're not on the top of everyones lists but I believe they deserve recognition. I can list many many more black metal bands too if anyone wants to know some more."
"The Blackest List.","what"
"The Blackest List.","[deleted]"
"The Blackest List.","Sigh, Silencer and Xasthur are pretty well known. And do you mean Dark Funeral?"
"The Blackest List.","I meant Black Funeral haha. I know Dark Funeral but I'm not really a fan of them"
"The Blackest List.","What? Silencer are well known? That's it, I officially dislike them and dub them posers.

But seriously, it's nice to see them described that way. I remember back when ""Death - Pierce Me"" first came out and my friends and I had a phase with it. Good old days."
"The Blackest List.","In terms of ""arguably black metal stuff that's popular on here regardless of genre"" I think Deafheaven should be added. However, they're only at 83k fans... is that the only guideline being used here?"
"The Blackest List.","for now yes. i want there to be a concrete criterion so that a band's exclusion is based in some kind of objectivity and not just individual capriciousness. "
"The Blackest List.","The hundred thousand listener guideline only applies to black metal bands.  My understanding is that bands that do not play black metal (e.g. Deafheaven) are banned regardless of listener count."
"The Blackest List.","If the list only applies to BM then why is Agalloch on it?

"
"The Blackest List.","agalloch has been posted several times before, and a shocking number of people continue to labor under the delusion that they are, in part at least, a bm band. their inclusion in the list serves to disabuse unequivocally those lost souls of that notion."

"I need some recommendations","So, I've dedicated February to getting to know black metal, a genre that I never really got into. 

It all started with Enslaved - Havenless. From there I kind of took the historical approach and started with Mayhem, Burzum, Bathory etc. 

Going from Wikipedia and the blackest list in the side bar of this sub, I've about covered the early scene, the large influential bands and a lot of the current large names. 

So here's where I need help. There is *a lot* of black metal to listen to and I need some guidance. 

My favorite albums so far are:

**Enslaved - Below the Lights** - This is one of the greatest albums I've ever heard. It's evil, it's technical and it's playful. Holy shit. I dislike their later albums. Clean vocals is not my thing. 

**Taake - Doedskvad** - This is black metal I could get drunk to. It's aggressive and fun, but tight as shit. 

**Dissection - Storm of the Light's Bane** - The exact right amount of melodic 

**Burzum - Filosofem** - A bit slower and more evil than I think I prefer, but I don't believe I have to defend Varg's skills as a composer 

Bonus: **Kvelertak - Kvelertak** - This isn't really black metal, but there are winks and nods. I love metal that can have a bit of fun with its genre (have I come to the wrong place? :) 

Of any of you have some recommendations from outside The Blackest List based on this, I would love to hear them. 

Thanks! "

"I need some recommendations","Check out Krallice. You'll like them. Woe, Negator, and Lo-Ruhamah might be up your alley too.

Check out Wolves In The Throne Room - ""Two Hunters"" album, and the bands Weakling, Drudkh, and Blood of Kingu.

You might like Ulver - ""Bergtatt"" too. Funeral Mist - ""Holy Poison"" is worth checking out as well, though it might be a little more extreme than what you're looking for.

A Hill To Die Upon and 1349 too maybe.

If he wants to get back with Marissa Nadler and let her handle the singing, that'd be much better. "

I like bluegrass and I like Xasthur, but I really don't have any immediate interest in hearing him play what he calls bluegrass. "

"Xasthur's new full length announced to be released in 2016","I was excited when i read this earlier today, but the post, and Scott's post are a bit misleading.   His ""reason"" for bringing back Xasthur is for name recognition only, which sorta bums me out.

Xasthur was fucking AWESOME. He released some records that are just fantastic - but, Nocturnal Poisoning just, well, it's not that good.  It's also not appealing to fans of Xasthur because it's completely different music."

"Caladan Brood - City of Azure Fire",""
"Caladan Brood - City of Azure Fire","I wrote Caladan Brood off as a second-rate Summoning clone when I first heard them. This wasn't *too* bad, as Summoning are one of my favourite bands of all time, but lately this album has really 'clicked' for me, and this song has a lot to do with that. I think the moment that really unlocked the band's aesthetic for me was the break into clean singing from about 3:25 - 4:10. I think that this sort of thing, when done well, really adds something to this style of music; like that point in Summoning's [Land of the Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HipoikwHRb8) at 7:30 where the choral element suddenly breaks in, and then it all starts building up again. Genuinely epic stuff."
"Caladan Brood - City of Azure Fire","They also have some really great Summoning covers on youtube. [The Passing of the Grey Company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HlQYXV1p4A) and [Marching Homewards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGqFjUaI5Q). I think the part that struck most with me about Caladan Brood was the Malazan series. Those books are so fucking good."
"Caladan Brood - City of Azure Fire","I love these guys.  I gave them $20 on bandcamp a while back to hopefully encourage them to keep coming out with more music.  If you haven't heard Summoning you should check them out too as they're very similar.

Bandcamp page: http://caladanbrood.bandcamp.com/"
"Caladan Brood - City of Azure Fire","Can you recommend me a good summoning album ? "
"Caladan Brood - City of Azure Fire","My personal favorite is Minas Morgul. It still encompasses the raw aspect of black metal while maintaining the epic feel Summoning is noteworthy for. My favorite songs off the album are ""Through the Forest of Dol-Guldur,"" ""The Legend of the Master Ring,"" ""Lugburz,"" and ""The Passing of the Grey Company."" Caladan Brood actually did a cover of The Passing of the Grey Company. I definitely recommend listening to all Summoning albums though. Each one really brings something new. "

"Caladan Brood - City of Azure Fire","If you want to be blown away right away, just listen to Land of the Dead. "
"Caladan Brood - City of Azure Fire","If you really loved the Caladan Brood album, I'd say *Oath Bound* is probably your best bet. That said, I think the best Summoning album overall (in terms of consistency over the whole album) is *Let Mortal Heroes Sing Your Fame*.

I think you may have noticed that you've been recommended damn near every single Summoning album by different people now though, so probably you should just go get them all."

My ears are terrible at this kind of thing, and I know the lyrics are *fucking amazing*, so I'd like to minimize the amount I just make up. This is what I've got so far, I'd be immensely grateful for any additional lines y'all can figure out (ignore the stuff in parentheses, still need to know those lines too):

Now this one had some decent parts but for the most part sounded quite generic. I love Carach Angren and all of their previous releases but this album isn't looking too good."
"Carach Angren “Two Flies Flew Into A Black Sugar Cobweb” Video Premiere (Bloody-Disgusting.com)","This is fucking reprehensibly bad"
"Carach Angren “Two Flies Flew Into A Black Sugar Cobweb” Video Premiere (Bloody-Disgusting.com)","As someone who absolutely loved their first three albums, like listened to them straight for several months, I can unequivocally say, I hate this album.

I have no idea what the hell they were thinking. They got rid of their trademark sound and the subject matter is stupid (for a black metal band). Disappointed."
"Carach Angren “Two Flies Flew Into A Black Sugar Cobweb” Video Premiere (Bloody-Disgusting.com)","I totally agree, man. Their first albums were great, especially Where the Corpses Sink Forever. - That album was fucking golden, not one bad song on it. But this...I'm almost speechless. I still had hope, even after reading the album subject, name, ect., but before I even reached a minute into the video/song, I was beyond disappointed, and even laughing a little bit at the fucking awful, AWFUL, lyrics. The lyrics sounded like they were ripped from a Creepypasta written by a 2edgy4me fifteen-year-old who'd just discovered the power of adjectives. Nothing lead to a proper climax, not the lyrics, not the music, nothing. I literally just got done listening to the song, and I already can't remember even one riff from the entire eight minutes the song ran for. It was all just droning nonsense, from beginning to end.

Ugh...gonna have to wait another three years for an Angren album...hopefully that one will be good. :("
"Carach Angren “Two Flies Flew Into A Black Sugar Cobweb” Video Premiere (Bloody-Disgusting.com)","Oh my god, get out of my head! Seriously though, you literally stated exactly what I was telling my best friend. He loves (loved?) them as much as I did (totally agree about Where the Corpses Sink Forever, Funerary Dirge of the Violinist is just an amazing piece of music) and he thinks it's good (and I usually agree with him about 95% of the time). I can't convince him otherwise at this point, he's waiting to give the entire album a chance.

After hearing the 1st song, I was like, ""well, maybe the rest of the album won't suck this bad."" After the 2nd song I said, ""man, this album sounds like it's really going to suck, but to be fair I've only heard 22% of the album."" Then there was today. Seriously, what the fuck?!?!?! A fucking clown, a CLOWN in a black metal song? I totaled up the times of the songs, it's about 16 minutes and 53 seconds. The average metal album is around 35 to 40 minutes, so we've basically heard half the album. That does not bode well.

Your comment regarding the droning nonsense is spot on. One of the things I loved about them is the dynamic nature of their music. Take Funerary Dirge, it goes from fast, pounding metal, to amazing symphonics, to spoken word, then back to metal, etc.... This album (every song) has literally been tremolo picking and blast beats. If I wanted to hear that I'd listen to Cannibal Corpse or Deicide (which I won't because I hate that shit).

So, yeah, you're 100% right. Although, I fear that their next album will be crap too as this has started their downfall. It seems like 3 albums is the maximum a band can produce before declining. I used to love (like LOVE) Children of Bodom. I could play every song on my guitar, I had a custom ESP like Alexi, I even have the same gear in my rig (Lee Jackson Preamp, Intellifex reverb, etc...). Then Hatecrew came out, and I felt like, hmmm... this is different than before. After Hatecrew, I basically stopped listening. I really think 3 is the magic number.

It's good to know I'm not crazy and this album really does suck (as compared to their previous, maybe from some random band it would be ok, but knowing their history, it sucks)."
"Carach Angren “Two Flies Flew Into A Black Sugar Cobweb” Video Premiere (Bloody-Disgusting.com)","I'm glad you agree with my points. :) I haven't listened to the entire album yet, I'll probably pira-...uh...buy it later next week if I get the chance. And, I can understand if Carach wanted to do something different, but if you're gonna' do something this terribly different, just start a god damn side project for fuck's sake and stop tainting the (what was) otherwise perfect name of Carach Angren. But, I think you're right about the three golden albums thing. I've seen that go through a lot of bands. I mean, it happened to Darkthrone. Their second, third and fourth albums were fucking amazing. Then, after that, they just slowly declined into a glob of shitty shit-shit. I think there's some sort of undiscovered arbitrary musical entropy that activates after a good metal band makes three consecutively good albums. It angers me... But, if I could defend Carach Angren on this, the only defense I could truthfully give, is that there's no way in hell they were going to make an album better than Where the Corpses Sink Forever. Once you've hit the top, there's only way to go. That album was the best album I'd ever heard aside from a select few.
Where the Corpses Sink Forever was not only masterfully played and composed, but the song placement within the album was also fucking genius. Every song slightly referenced a song prior. If you were to just listen to one of the songs by itself, it wouldn't seem like anything special (unless of course you're listening to The Funerary Dirge of a Violinist, which is easily amazing by itself), but if you listen to the entire album; each song uses perfect context and slightly references a different song. It's amazing. Listening to just only one song of Where the Corpses Sink Forever is like watching only one scene to an amazing movie."
"Carach Angren “Two Flies Flew Into A Black Sugar Cobweb” Video Premiere (Bloody-Disgusting.com)","I agree with 100% of what you've said. About Corpses, you're totally right, it's like one perfectly awesome scene from a movie. It really does transport you somewhere. That's what I love(d) about Carach Angren. Their music was theatrical. Now maybe that's not ""black metal"" in the traditional sense, but I think that's BS. If Mayhem had access to money and studios, they wouldn't have been recording in the woods in Norway with a cassette deck.

I've noticed other bands, when they hit the ""perfect"" album, it's hard to match that. For me it was Follow the Reaper by Bodom, Clayman for In Flames, Progenies by Dimmu, IX Equilibrium by Emperor, and that's all I can think of right now. I'm still waiting to see if Wintersun can keep up their epic awesomeness (Jari's kind of my hero in music).

In any case, stay strong brother! Hopefully you're right and Carach Angren's next album won't suck as bad. Until then, may you stumble across some kick ass bands!

Also, I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention that it's nice to talk to a fellow metal head that can articulate why the music is phenomenal. That's a rare quality, and awesome to find in a fellow metal head."

Anyways, I've been working on an archive of some of my favourite Black Metal albums in the past few months. I still have a lot of albums to add, but it's pretty updated. Many of the albums are fairly underground and/or underrated, so I'm sure everyone here can discover at least one new Black Metal album. There's a stickied post at the top, explaining some things about the subreddit. Also, the newest post on the sub gives a bit of info about what's happened to it recently (Summary: I'm looking for moderators.)

I encourage you to leave a comment on an album you enjoy, or maybe send me some recommendations. I'd like to help people discover new music, so I figured this would be the best place to do it.

Have a great day, and I hope you enjoy. Here's the sub: /r/BlackMetalArchive"

"What is Black Metal to you?","To me, Black Metal is to Metal what Punk was to Rock and Roll. Its just nothing. Standing for whatever, fuck the world, hail self empowerment and fuck what everyone thinks. I think that, like punk, Black Metal became kind of full of itself. But i do generally think that Black Metal is in a good place these days. To me, I will call something Black Metal as a descriptive faster than I would label a certain group of bands ""Black Metal"". "
"What is Black Metal to you?","I've recognized the punk-like attitude in Black Metal, and although it's only one aspect of BM I still think it's a very important one. A lot of BM bands do stand for ""whatever"" and the ones that stand upon deep and enriching subject material and don't give a fuck what the mainstream establishment drone-minded zombies think,  are the ones that stand out to me.

Unfortunately like you said, some BM bands have become full of themselves. Not naming names, but I still listen to them if I like their sound and feeling."

"What is Black Metal to you?","It's a Nexionic art form and a propaganda tool. It is (was?) useful in the creation of a subculture zeitgeist that had the potential to spur certain individuals predisposed to it towards action. Spiritually speaking, or otherwise. As far as music goes objectivity, it's one my favorite genres because it expresses how I feel; even though that's a pretty mundane answer its still important. I feel like I make sense to myself when I listen to it, if that can make any sense. 

Edit: As far as Satanic themes being a necessity to Black Metal, I disagree. Any archetype that that inspires the application of will and potential fits within what I believe BM set out to do. I also accept things that seek to express and reveal parts of the self; hidden or otherwise. But thats because that is helpful to me as a person. However, I think having an overall unified philosophy which focuses on LHP conscious theory/evolution is beneficial. 

"
"What is Black Metal to you?","&gt; it's one my favorite genres because it expresses how I feel; even though that's a pretty mundane answer its still important

I don't find it to be a mundane answer at all. Expression is an outward act of feeling. And to feel music is more than just listening to it, especially if it encourages you to express your own feelings.

I also agree with your statement on Satanic themes. I can take them or leave them either way, as long as the music speaks to me on a deep level. If the musical lyrics and themes contain a form of esoteric knowledge which spurs my inquisitive nature to seek its meaning, then I will be more inclined to listen to it more as I seek out other sources for this knowledge.

While seeking out one's own self I believe it is important to address the dark parts of our duality. If we can shed light on those things within and overcome them, or if they're not conquerable then accepting them, we not only better ourselves and understand ourselves as individuals, but we have a better understanding of human nature and humanity as a whole. "
"What is Black Metal to you?","Black Metal Ist Krieg.
War, war against the world, against the destruction, fighting with even more destruction, filled with darkness &amp; doom.

&gt;

&gt;The __early Norwegian black metal scene__ was a [black metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_metal) music scene and [subculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture) in [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway) during the early 1990s. It is credited with creating the modern black metal genre and produced some of the most highly-acclaimed and influential artists in extreme metal.

&gt;The scene attracted massive media attention when it was revealed that its members had been responsible for two [murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder) and a wave of church burnings in Norway. The scene had an ideology and ethos and was likened to a [cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult), with the core members referring to themselves as ""The Black Circle"" or ""Black Metal Inner Circle"". It consisted primarily of young men, many of whom gathered at the record shop Helvete (""Hell"") in [Oslo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo). In interviews, they voiced extreme [anti-Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Christian_sentiment) and [misanthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misanthropy) views, presenting themselves as genuine [Satanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanism) who wanted to spread terror, hatred and evil. They adopted pseudonyms and appeared in photographs wearing '[corpse paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpse_paint)' and wielding medieval weaponry. The scene was exclusive and created boundaries around itself, incorporating only those it deemed to be ""true"" or committed. Musical integrity was highly important and artists wanted black metal to remain [underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_music) and uncorrupted.

&gt;In August 1993, several of its members were arrested and in May 1994 were convicted variously for arson, murder, assault and possession of explosives. Most showed no remorse for their actions. The Norwegian media covered events closely, but the reporting of the scene was often sensationalist. For example, one Norwegian TV channel interviewed a woman who claimed Satanists had sacrificed her child and killed her dog.  The early Norwegian black metal scene has since been the subject of books and documentaries.

"What is Black Metal to you?","[deleted]"
"What is Black Metal to you?","As I sit here I'm listening to Filosofem and the song ""Jesu Dod"" is playing. This song is full of raw energy and emotion. The lo-fi recording exemplifies the feeling of coldness, anger, and despair. I have the heat cranked up in my room and I still get goosebumps during this song, even after listening to it hundreds of times. As the album transitions to ""Erblicket die Töchter des Firmaments"" the pace slows down, the mood gets more despairingly dark and the feeling gets colder.

To me this is the heart of Black Metal. Coldness, despair, animosity, misanthropy, anti-religion, anti-establishment. 

So lo-fi Vs. hi-fi: I honestly prefer lo-fi, but I'm not against hi-fi recordings necessarily either. I just prefer the lo-fi feelings, and the ""I did this shit myself for dirt cheap. Fuck your $4K recording equipment"" attitude towards bands who believe they've made it big with expensive studio equipment and a large contract.

Satanic Vs. Non-Satanic lyrics: If the lyrics actually have something meaningful to say other than ""Look at me I worship Satan, boogy boogy boo!"" Then I don't care either way. As long as the lyrics are deeply personal to the musician and identifiable to me on an emotional, spiritual, or philosophical level, I'll listen to it and likely enjoy it. Even if it's not trve."
"What is Black Metal to you?","It's about the music. The riffs, the screams and anything that goes with it. I think I actually prefer the lyrics not to be about Satan, that stuff has gotten pretty old, but it's not that important. I also prefer good sound quality over poor but usually won't let lo-fi stop me from enjoying good tunes."
"What is Black Metal to you?","I've talked about that with some friends of mine who aren't into metal at all and it seems that I listen to Black Metal like they listen to Reggae. It calms me down, help me feel at home, and when people don't like it when it's on, they are very vocal about it.

Nothing is better on a sunday morning than a cup of herbal tea with Burzum, Opera IX or Lustre."
"What is Black Metal to you?","life itself"
"What is Black Metal to you?","I like the power, the ambiance, the speed, the brutality, the harsh vocals, and the clash of beauty with chaos and violence.  It is a good reminder of the chaotic and strange world we live in.  

To be honest, I don't pay too much attention to lyrical content.  If a band is singing against religion, or about natural themes, great.  If they are singing about satanic things (as in, Satan is a person), I'll listen to it out of my disdain for religion and it's ideas for entertainment purposes, but I don't ""believe"" in ""Satan.""  

If a band is advertising that they are totalitarian/Nazi/Christian, I won't go out of my way to listen to it as it'll probably sour what I think of it.  

I think Lo-Fi vs Hi-Fi doesn't matter too much, both can be done correctly.  

I don't see either of the trends you mentioned to be necessary to the music."
"What is Black Metal to you?","I feel like an outsider a bit when it comes to being a black metal fan, because all these people are like ""hurrdurr it has to be lofi"" and other hurrdurr shit. And I'm just over here, not giving a fuck. I listen to whatever black metal sounds good. From Agalloch to Xasthur, I pretty much like it all. I like some Aryan, Satanic, Pagan, Depressive, it really doesn't matter if its hifi or lofi. If it sounds good to me, I like it
"
"What is Black Metal to you?","Black metal is much more than just music. "
"What is Black Metal to you?","How so? I know Black Metal usually strives to have some sort of stance against something or a certain ideology - however at it's core it's music. Black Metal should be about enjoying the *sound* of the music, not JUST the ideology. If you listen to Black Metal talk about ideology but not just the music it's probably better to just read a book about it. 

Yes, I can understand that Black Metal is one of them genres that resonates with people and can evoke strong feeling. It moves me sometimes but I would say, like any other genre it's just music."
"What is Black Metal to you?","well it really depends on what black metal means to you. Personally, I see black metal as the best vehicle for certain ideals. Ideals which are anti-human, anti-society and anti-weakness. Black metal in that sense is intolerance. Think about how foolish the idea of christian black metal is, for one."
"What is Black Metal to you?","&gt;Black metal in that sense is intolerance. Think about how foolish the idea of christian black metal is, for one.

Maybe if you compare it to what the history was in the 90's with the whole 2nd wave of Norwegian Black Metal. However, I think it certainly does have a place in Black Metal if it isn't preachy. It would be interesting to see a Black Metal band that is Christian that talks about his faith and possibly the negative things surrounding it. 

&gt;well it really depends on what black metal means to you. Personally, I see black metal as the best vehicle for certain ideals. Ideals which are anti-human, anti-society and anti-weakness.

Sure, I agree but Black Metal in my opinion should be a vehicle for a whole plethorda load of different topics. Just because the originators of the scene were focusing on that doesn't mean that it can not evolve. Heck, I love the topics you just described in Black Metal but I also share the same love but Atmospheric Black Metal which is about nature and all that good stuff. To me, diversity is the spice of life and as long as an idea has integrity and is delivered well they could talk about anything they want."
"What is Black Metal to you?","I think I would like the idea of atmospheric black metal played about the idea of primitivism and the rejection of society. I see that as an extension of the anti-humanist aspect of black metal. The idea is interesting. Basically if the Unabomber was into BM."
"What is Black Metal to you?","&gt;Think about how foolish the idea of christian black metal is, for one.

Maybe to you based on your idea of black metal...which totally isn't the only one or the most valid (or necessarily valid at all) viewpoint about the genre. "
"What is Black Metal to you?","Well you can have your viewpoint on this and it can differ, but I firmly believe that black metal can never be steadfast in its conviction if it were done about ""harmony"" or any such subjects."
"What is Black Metal to you?","Your insistence that black metal has to have a firm conviction in the subjects you think it does is pretty interesting to me, honestly. It's just not consistent that a genre you literally can't know the ideology behind half the time without reading a lyric sheet is bound by those lyrics and the thoughts behind them. 

It's like I've said to you before- if you're really enjoying a band's sound and then the lyric sheet reveals that their lyrics are predominantly pro-Christian, how does that make them any worst than they were a second ago? Some people would even insist that makes them not black metal- how can that possibly be the case? "
"What is Black Metal to you?","Well you can't say you're fully consuming the meaning of it if you're only exposed to part of it. Even if the lyrics were clearly audible, the act of reciting them mentally reinforces that message. The act of viewing the art helps put the viewer in a certain mindframe. The aspects of it aren't chosen by accident. I do not believe in fulling listening or understanding an idea without consciously engaging my mind with all aspects of it, as far as it is possible.   
  
And in that unlikely hypothetical situation, I would feel very much revulsed. I'm not sure in what you believe in, but I am proud to say I cannot not feel hate even when I walk past a church or a mosque. Some people would say they are not black metal, yes. But ultimately it depends on how you personally define black metal."
"What is Black Metal to you?","Man, I don't even know how to respond to a lot of that. Especially 

&gt;but I am proud to say I cannot not feel hate even when I walk past a church or a mosque. 

I mean, I'm an atheist, but like, wow. I have absolutely no response. "
"What is Black Metal to you?","Well if it's any consolation, I've long known that your views differ very greatly but I respect your good taste in music. That we can agree on."
"What is Black Metal to you?","ty bb. For what it's worth, disagreements about views on the music aside, I feel the same way about you- can't say you've ever talked about a band positively/posted a band that was anything less than pretty damn good, as far as I've seen."
"What is Black Metal to you?","I like anything that is directly or idealogically opposed to monotheist filth, and sounds nice to me. Fell in love with BM listening to Gorgoroth's Pentagram back when people still had cassettes. Still listen to Mgła and Burzum in my car so loud that I offend pretty much everyone I come in contact with. "
"What is Black Metal to you?","So polytheistic dogmas are inherently better or worse?"
"What is Black Metal to you?","Inherently less relevant. The monotheists have spent the last 1000 years meddling and trying to expand their bunk morals and ideals by any means necessary."
"What is Black Metal to you?","In the sense of geopolitics I would have to agree that the abrahamic religions have had more influence and are thus a bigger threat. But I feel that any organised religion is based on the subjugation of one by others. This limits true development of the human to beyond itself and thus I find it objectionable. "
"What is Black Metal to you?","organization and subjugation aren't the same thing. it's the jewchrislam shitbags who made religion wholly focused on subjugation and only subjugation."
"What is Black Metal to you?","Well I do understand how the two can be conflated, but I hold that large scale organisation inherently carried cooperation and with that ideological compromise. "
"What is Black Metal to you?","It's mostly about my need to look down on everyone else and say they're not kvlt enough.

It's also great music for handjobs.

EDIT: guys I'm kidding. Put down your spiked armbands, I'm just fucking around."
"What is Black Metal to you?","To me, not so much. Either of these ""flavors"" has its gems. And I think this is the general consensus on _this_ subreddit. But if you go to /r/TrueBlackMetal that's a different story"
"What is Black Metal to you?","I wasn't even aware of it's existence. Thanks for posting that. 

I agree; however, in regards to satanic lyrics, it's funny that some of the more influential SWBM (Burzum, Bathory) weren't luciferians. They just sought to be the antithesis of Christianity, so they used the imagery as a form protestantism. In spite of that, some are of the opinion that black metal isn't black metal without satanism. 

Hopefully were all here because we like the way it sounds. It is music afterall. "
"What is Black Metal to you?","Unspoiled nature."
"What is Black Metal to you?","Cool music. Nothing more, nothing less- it's just a type of music that I really enjoy. I don't care about the imagery, I don't care about whether an artist is into it for anything more than the riffs- I just care about if it's something enjoyable to me. "
"What is Black Metal to you?","Yeah, I like your response. Its about the nice music style. I listen to a lot of different kind of music, but black metal is my favorite.

Black metal has a nice image, but its not really a path you follow. Its something more personal you don't really want to share. IMO

Too bad you get downvoted. "
"What is Black Metal to you?","It's not a popular opinion here- which I think is too bad. Whatever. "
"What is Black Metal to you?","This is why we often don't agree about metal. "

    I am your ruler so hear my words
    I am your GOD you can write books only about me

    I had risen you out of dust and I shall turn you to dust again
    
    You shall worship me because I am your Lord
    And you shall love your neighbors night and day
    Who shall not bow to me proclaim him a heretic
    And to let him know my power burn him alive
    
    Now I rule you and crowd of priest I have
    Fill world with churches and lots of towers
    Therein you shall pray and never you can laugh
    Believe that your lives are fully in my hands
    
    My immense power over you weakens with your laughter
    And therefore now declare: ""From now on, laughter is sin""
    My immense power over you reduces with your laughter
    And therefore now declare: ""To be cheerful is sin""
    
    I am your ruler so hear my words
    I am your GOD you can write books only about me
    I am here to bring you fear
    I had risen you out of dust and I shall turn you to dust again
    
    I am the Almighty God and I should not be afraid
    When I see the faces laughing, then I cannot laugh myself
    Who among you is laughing, he is not afraid of me
    And one who is not afraid, he could turn me into dust"

"Conqueror - War Cult Supremacy Live","So unbelievably jealous."
"Conqueror - War Cult Supremacy Live","I don't get this bands appeal. I like Diocletian, I like Teitanblood, I like a ton of super grindy/noisy/gross/putrid/low-fi music. I just can't get into this band for some reason. Someone explain it to me, seriously. What am I missing?"
"Conqueror - War Cult Supremacy Live","Idk dude. Do you like Revenge? "
"Conqueror - War Cult Supremacy Live","Not really. I think all this war metal stuff is just mixed so shitty that I can't hear the riffs."
"Conqueror - War Cult Supremacy Live","With Conqueror, it works largely because most of the time you CAN’T hear the riffs. It’s the sound of chaos: guitars, drums and vocals all in violent, lawless combat with one another. Waves of sound clashing together like three ill-defined armies in a war of all against all. But then, sometimes, one part will gain a temporary advantage—a vocal couplet, the drums ceasing to blast for a few bars, a hook-ish guitar riff—like the battle subsides for just a moment to watch as a legendary warrior utterly devastates an opponent in single combat.

That being said, there’s an awful lot of terrible war metal. Like grindcore, it’s easy to make and thus easy to make poorly. Especially by bands that don’t take the time to understand how and why the music is composed the way it is and instead just imitate the superficialities (i.e. simple riffs, constant blasting, goats with bullet belts).
"
"Conqueror - War Cult Supremacy Live","This is an eloquent and thoughtful explanation. However, part of me still feels like, if the point is not to actually hear the riffs in a metal song, it's sort of fruitless. It reminds me of the Simpsons episode with this exchange:

Lisa: You have to listen to the notes she's not playing.

"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Hey Guys, I follow the metal writer Kim 'Grim Kim' Kelly on Twitter and it seems like a lot of BM people have a problem with her.  I respect her journalism and taste, but what's the problem? It seems like it's about political correctness, or something.  Does anybody know or have the backstory?"
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","I have the backstory. 

It has absolutely nothing to do with the Dragonforce article. That's practically ancient history at this point. Phil McSorley from Cobalt and Mike Meacham from Loss were pissed off about Kim's Caïna interview because Andy talked about feminism. Phil from Cobalt took umbrage at this and started calling Andy from Caïna, a ""faggot"", a ""pussy"", a ""homo"", and a ""weak little bitch"" on Caïna's facebook page. Soon afterwards, he turned his ire on Kim (despite the fact that she was Cobalt's merch girl and published the only interview with his new project, Recluse) and said on Recluse's page ""Kim Kelly and the rest of the USBM friendship scene can suck our fucking cocks. No love, no faggot jean vest friends. We aren't friends."" Mike Meacham jumped in and talked some shit on his personal page too. Then they deleted their posts like the ""trve kvlt badasses"" they are. Most in the community have come out in support of her including Erik from Cobalt saying that Phil doesn't speak for the band and how tasteless and ridiculous Phil's post was. It's mega-disappointing to see people with great lyric writing skills come off like high school jock douchebags to say the least. Every metal musician and journalist I know who has weighed in on this thinks these dudes are just assholes.

Edit: Downvote all you want but that's the actual story. "
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Not saying I don't believe you but do you have any links? If any of that stuff is still up at least..."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Kim's twitter and fb page are private. 

Here's Caïna's fb page where one of Phil's comments is still there on their December 11th post: https://www.facebook.com/cainaband

McSorley and Meacham deleted their statuses which explicitly call her out by name. I have screenshots of the statuses but I'd prefer not to post them as they come from Kim's page. I quoted the Recluse post verbatim in my previous post. Meacham's is just something along the lines of ""Screw feminism and Kim for bringing it up"". 

Here's Mutilation Rites actually discussing it in their set last night: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIXOsOIKVBE

"
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","I heard McSorley went kinda crazy. Maybe this is the manifestation of that. Seems like he's upset that black metal bands are talking the talk but aren't walking the walk, but this happens to literally every genre of music as it expands. I don't really know where I stand on that, but it's always better not to be a dickbag to the people that are responsible for spreading the word about your music.

"
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","I get wanting to return to a certain musical quality but he's basically trolling people on facebook who don't meet his standards of masculinity which makes him way less of an LLN-esque kvlt warrior and more of a majorly insecure high school jock picking on kids he knows won't fight back. And Meacham just can't stand that someone with a vagina has an opinion on extreme metal. By all accounts, the rest of their bands, Cobalt and Loss respectively, are great people and artists and don't share their bandmates' noxious views. There's rumors that the war fucked Phil up and I hope he gets help if that's the case (maybe help isn't ""manly"" enough for him) but that's no excuse for his actions.

I think what's funnier is all of the musicians talking about their own falling out with Phil and/or Mike. Basically all comes down to, ""There's only so much caricatures of Jews from the 30s and boasts about ""killing towelheads"" that I can take before saying goodbye."" Ex-Cobalt live members, Aesop from Agalloch, Stavros from The Atlas Moth and more. If these guys wanted to isolate themselves, well, they've done that but they've also become a sad joke.

Honestly, Recluse should just change their name to Insecure. Certainly a better reflection of the real driving force behind them.

"
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Wow, thats some lame shit. Thanks for the links. "
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","That puts Cobalt briefly dissolving earlier this year in a new light, as McSorley hasn't seemed that insufferable before in interview settings and I'm sure Wunder puts up with a lot of shit.

^^^^^Slow ^^^^^Forever ^^^^^when?"
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Whelp, Phil is officially kicked out of the band. Wunder is entering the studio in June 2015 for Slow Forever. 

Phil's response: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B4_JyutIYAAieoW.jpg

Classy....

I'll miss his Gonzo writing style and vocal work but this dude has basically done everything short of threatening Wunder with bodily harm to get himself kicked out of Cobalt. You can talk about how black metal has personalities with anti-social, unsavory views, but it's Wunder's right to not want to be associated with someone so blatantly bigoted because it's affecting his art. "
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Holy shit…

I hope Wunder can handle the vocals on his own - he only did harsh vocals on part of one cobalt song, but he's a great clean singer. "
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","She often mentions sexism in metal, which in turn, brings out all of the sexists to mention her."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","EDIT IM WRONG I think the bulk of it is around [this](http://noisey.vice.com/blog/dragonforce-demoniac-interview) article. She discovered that members of Dragonforce used to have a band called Demoniac that made violent, homophobic and racist songs when they were teenagers. It was pretty ridiculous that someone who covers a genre that's rife with violent imagery and has an entire sub-genre based around racism would try and come down on them so hard for a silly thing they did when they were immature little kids. The entire interview was just them saying ""well yeah those songs were pretty bad but we were just dumb teenagers trying to be edgy as possible"" and Grim Kim responding with ""YEAH BUT IT WAS SO BAD! HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY THIS?!"""
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Which is funny considering she worked with Anal Cunt to promote an album.  Because they don't write *anything* that could be construed as racist or homophobic in any way."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","AC was an obvious parody act though. They probably didn't believe in what they wrote. Not sure about Demoniac."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Yeah, I understand. And from what I've heard she addressed her work with Anal Cunt and said basically, yeah that was dumb, I regret it.  Which is basically what the guys from DragonForce or whatever said I guess.  To both of which I say, OK, no big deal.  I just think people need to lighten up a bit.  I mean, I know we're not talking about Georgia O'Keefe or anything, but isn't art supposed to be controversial?"
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","I don't know, I disagree. There's a huge difference between the fantasy violence that 99.9999% of the bands singing about will never actually act on and the all too real and all too prevalent problem of racism. 

Also Dragonforce sucks, so who cares if somebody gives them a hard time for being shitty dudes?"
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","True on both counts - there's a difference between horror movie stuff and things that actually happen in real life, and Dragonforce sucks. Still, the article read like Kim was trying way too hard to gotcha them on something that doesn't really matter. I don't think any of the accused members would ever write those songs as adults or that there was any sincerity to the lyrics, and everyone's done shitty things when they were teenagers.

Also, some of the questions just seemed useless as actual interview questions. ""So do you think that offensive art still has value even if it upsets people?"" as a black metal journalist is like a gourmet chef asking ""do you think processed food is bad"" or something - it's just a silly question. ""Alright. So as far as the lyrics go, there’s no “Niggerslut Pt. II” on the new record, right? You guys are behaving?"" - They've never released an offensive song as Dragonforce, so of course there isn't. ""I guess you missed out on all that. It’s funny, you have a song talking about how much you hate immigrants, and you immigrated."" - doesn't that just prove their point that those lyrics were clearly just SO EDGY bullshit and not at all reflective of their true beliefs?

It'd be one thing if she was just writing an article to say ""hey check out what these guys used to be into"" - I'd still think it's pointless though - but the fact that it's an actual interview with all these non-questions makes it come across like holier-than-thou scolding over something they did as kids 15 years ago."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","I will never criticize somebody for calling out weak shit like racism or sexism, even if the attempt was a little tryhard. "
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","I mean, it's one thing to call out somebody being a racist and another to harass a current band- who probably thought that the interview was going to be about their upcoming album (wasn't out yet at the time) and then get harassed about age-old long-dead stuff. "
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Yeah, it certainly could've been more timely or relevant. I guess I'm more blown away that anybody would consider the Caina interview 'offensive' than the Dragonforce one. McSorley and Meacham are definitely doing more to damage the integrity of black metal than Dragonforce, no doubt. I doubt most black metal fans give a semblance of a fuck what Dragonforce says or does."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","First: They were just joking around. Immature children. You can't really compare that to anything at that point. Just teenager Metal-fans trying to be edgy.

Second: 

&gt; Also Dragonforce sucks, so who cares if somebody gives them a hard time for being shitty dudes?

That's irrelevant. "
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","I think you're right, but I also think that people who don't 'mean' the racist shit they say, be it 'as a joke' or 'because they didn't know any better and were kids' or whatever, still normalize that kind of thing, and help make a safer climate for idiots who actually really get behind it to speak their mind, you know? People who don't necessarily consider themselves racist still give racism a place to fester when they do that shit, and calling it out seems admirable to me. Black metal is bigger than race, it's bigger than humanity. I don't want to let idiots demean it by trying to make it their white males only club. "
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","She has good taste, but she often comes across as being intentionally PC."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","I would say mixed taste, since she's not very discriminating at all.  She likes some good stuff but then spends a lot of time promoting Brooklyn ""modern black metal"" garbage like Krallice."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Just because you don't like Krallice doesn't make it garbage. You're kind of just being an example of what OP is talking about."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Sure, that's fair, but it is garbage regardless of him liking it or not."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","No, it is garbage.  Like a lot of other ""modern black metal""/USBM bands they substitute ""atmosphere"" and marketing for riffs and songwriting, only they add tech wankery into the mix as well.  I'm an example of someone having an issue with her?  Sure, but I don't see why that's a problem.  I explained why, and it has nothing to do with the fact that she's a woman and everything to do with what she chooses to support."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Oh, so all of a a sudden taste in music isn't subjective, huh? It may be garbage to you, but that doesn't make it garbage to the rest of the bloody world."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Some of us *like* atmosphere and pretentious wankery. Personally, I'm into synth-wank bands like Summoning, Nazgul, and Caladan Brood, but I can understand liking tech-wank or post-metal."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","I dont understand what's wrong with ""atmosphere"". I disagree that they lack songwriting, I think they write some really compelling, interesting stuff. I don't know where you get the marketing thing. They're on small labels and self released their last album. You're not an example of sexism, just one of someone who thinks their own  subjective opinion is objective fact and feels the need to slander what they don't understand."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","&gt; feels the need to slander what they don't understand.

Nice job coming across as super pretentious m8. Really did a good job pulling it together by ending with that. "
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","I have heard three out of however many records they have and I have seen them live, so I think I understand their gimmick well enough.  I re-read the OP's original post and found nothing in there about people who ""feel the need to slander what they don't understand,"" so now I'm confused as to how I'm supposed to be an example of what they're talking about.  Re: opinions versus facts, all genres have rules and defining characteristics, and if they're to be judged as a black metal band, they fail - no hatred, no aggression, might as well be listening to a Phish album."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","I guess I forgot I was in r/blackmetal, where not wearing face paint is a gimmick. Thanks for reminding me I should unsubscribe."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Yep, probably!"

"Grim Kim 'controversy'","Hey now, you leave marijuana out of this. It's done nothing wrong!"
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","When you're as public and write for publications on a scale like that, you can't exactly get away with casually supporting bands that might be racists. You either take a stand and hold onto it or watch the comment section devolve into calling you a hypocrite and so forth. Kim's consistent, especially in a community that typically shrugs at these things."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","She sounds like the type that frequents Tumblr and complains about being oppressed by... Everything.

Could be wrong, but she sounds like a SJW with  a studded belt on."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","You are but she did tell me that your comment made her laugh. "
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","I think she had a column or a site that got upended recently, but I could be wrong...ive always enjoyed her taste. "
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","I remember when she was a DJ on Drexel's college radio station. She mostly played sludge and doom stuff. Never mentioned why. She also was pretty good with requests and would play metalcore and other types of metal if you messaged her."
"Grim Kim 'controversy'","It's about the political correctness, and the 'FUCK YOU!' responses she gives to people who disagree with her. Besides that I have no idea why anyone would dislike her, she seems like a very nice and pleasant person judging by her writing."

"Do you guys listen to DSBM? (Depressive Suicidal Black Metal)","No. I think DSBM is the reason why so many people associate actual Black Metal with Screamo or Emo trash.

""But in this case, I think it's appropriate. If all your music is about killing yourself, then there's no reason as to why you shouldn't have done it yet. (Assuming you actually think that way.)"" 

I usually don't tell people to 'kill themselves' as an insult. Mainly because it's been done to me before, and it's really rude. But in this scenario, I think it's appropriate to suggest that they should commit suicide."
"Do you guys listen to DSBM? (Depressive Suicidal Black Metal)","Sure, and every band with songs about holocausts should just go out and slaughter millions of people. "
"Do you guys listen to DSBM? (Depressive Suicidal Black Metal)","There's a difference. People write lyrics about what interests them. But these people who write things about 'holocausts' don't say these things in interviews. They don't murder the interviewer, do they? They're perfectly normal, they just write lyrics like that because it's 'trendy'.

Ghost Bath on the other hand... Just try reading an interview with them. Or Shining. They seem for real, because they talk about hating themselves. MOST bands separate themselves from their lyrical content and their personality. Not Ghost Bath."

"What is everyones problem with Deafheaven?",""
"What is everyones problem with Deafheaven?","Obviously I can't speak for everyone, so I'm gonna explain why I dislike Deafheaven *personally*. 

First, I don't think they're Black Metal. And I think anybody who has actually listened to a few Black Metal albums will be able to notice this too. There are no other elements of Black Metal in Sunbather besides the vocals. Now 'Roads to Judah' actually contains some Black Metal. But that's another story.

Next, I'm gonna be honest, they're pretentious hipster fucks. Yeah yeah, I'm judging a band from their appearance. But I used to be a minor fan of Deafheaven. Their target audience and fanbase is not a group of people I ever want to associate myself with.

So to summarise: Most BM fans dislike Deafheaven because they're not Black Metal, and Sunbather is just bringing in a bunch of hipsters to the BM scene who think all Black Metal is similar to Sunbather. I don't like the music, personally. But I don't have a reason to publicly hate on it. I only dislike when people label it as Black Metal. 

"
"What is everyones problem with Deafheaven?","Interesting, i have a few questions for you then. 
Pretentious hipster fucks? What do you mean by that? Just beacuse of the fact that you're not wearing corpsepaint and slaughtering goats onstage does not mean that you can't play black metal. And also why is it not black metal musically? I mean theres blastbeats, tremolo picking, loud distorion, screams and shrieks. Basicly everything characteristic about BM. So do people hate on a band like Behemoth? They're more death metal today than black but they still look like a black metal band onstage. And what is the problem with more people entering the bm-scene and challenging it?"
"What is everyones problem with Deafheaven?","&gt; And also why is it not black metal musically? I mean theres blastbeats, tremolo picking, loud distorion, screams and shrieks. Basicly everything characteristic about BM.  
  
These elements are a small part of their music. If anything they're post-metal influenced by black metal, but that doesn't make them black metal.  
  
&gt; So do people hate on a band like Behemoth? They're more death metal today than black but they still look like a black metal band onstage.  
  
Yes, many people hate Behemoth. I hate newer Behemoth after Grom. I have no idea how this is news to you.  
  
&gt; And what is the problem with more people entering the bm-scene and challenging it?  
  
Because they're proclaiming membership in something they do not believe in, or belong to. If anything they're not challenging it. They're diluting it and pissing on it."
"What is everyones problem with Deafheaven?","Very well said. OP, read this."
"What is everyones problem with Deafheaven?","I know I'm going to sound like an elitist, but to me, there are more traits of Black Metal than just in a musical sense. Sure, if a song has all of the traits of BM, then it's BM. Simple. But I would still have difficulties calling them Black Metal, if that makes sense. It's difficult to explain - Anything can *sound* Black Metal, just using all the traits of Black Metal. But I would still have difficulties calling the band 'Black Metal' if they were Vegan hipsters living in Seattle somewhere.

Anyways, musically, they're still not Black Metal. Production is clean as hell. The lyrics aren't in any way similar to Black Metal. Look at the fucking cover art man. Do you expect someone to look at a pink cover with fancy font and go ""Fucking brutal BM BM album man, what's its name?"" No. I'm sure a musician can explain it more in-depth in a technical sense, but sometimes you just have to trust your gut. Compare the song 'Transilvanian Hunger' to the song 'Dream House' (Lol, what  a BM name...) Then tell me straight-faced that they're the same genre.

Anyways, shit like Deafheaven is becoming more and more common. Bands such as Lantlos, Alcest, Krallice, Liturgy, etc. are sprouting up everywhere. As a result, people have made a new 'genre' called Blackgaze. WHICH I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE USE. Why, you may ask? 

Let's take everyone from a Liturgy show, and put them in the same room as everyone in a Sargeist or Arckanum show. These people don't get along together in real life, or on the Internet. We shouldn't lump these genres and fans into the same genre. Only controversies will sprout.

Anyways, hopefully I answered your questions. I just did some random mind babble. Let me know if you have any more. Keep in mind I'm answering strictly from a personal point of view.


"
"What is everyones problem with Deafheaven?","I have no idea how people can define black metal only musically. It's not entirely about lyrics either. It's about an idelogy, if you ask me."
"What is everyones problem with Deafheaven?","ideology about what?"
"What is everyones problem with Deafheaven?","This is in itself a good question. For me the idea of black metal is best expressed as the militant intolerance of weakness and the supremacy of strength."
"What is everyones problem with Deafheaven?","Im not trying to attack anyone here, but what you're saying is that black metal is not a musical genre but an ideology about the militant intolerance of weakness? So like kill the handicapped people or what? "
"What is everyones problem with Deafheaven?","Pete helmkamp. The conqueror manifesto. There's your starting point. "
"What is everyones problem with Deafheaven?","Ok kid, you got your answer and now you are just being annoying. Deafheaven is not a black metal band. You clearly wanted to argue that they are, and were not actually interested in the educated responses to the contrary. I can confirm this because [you tried to get /r/progmetal to back you up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2pguc7/can_anybody_help_in_this_argument_against_black/).   
   
Its time for you to shut up and go away.

Nergal is a fucking celebrity in Poland. Fucking clown talking about satanism in breakfast TV. Also he hangs out with pathetic popstars and shit like that.
Their music doesnt matter for me i just don't listen to them.


Oh, and about deafheaven - they are just terrible, ""easy listening"" metal that gets alot of attention from hipsters. It's really bad for the scene, it's bad for the genre."

Peste Noire is not something Neige does, BTW, he was out of the band before they ever had a proper album and he only wrote one of the songs on the second album.  Peste Noire is Famine and the people he hires."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","I didn't like Alcest the first time I listened to it, or any subsequent times.  Just does nothing for me."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","[deleted]"
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Nope, but I tried."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","The first I heard from him was his involvement in Amouseurs, which to this day still stands as one of my favourite albums. Checking out his independent stuff I stumbled upon ""Souvenirs D'un Autre Monde"" first. I liked it, but it took me a couple listens to really vibe with the sound. After that I explored his earlier stuff (this was like 2009 at the time), and naturally loved it. I think that through seeing the range of music helped me appreciate is more traditional BM style a lot more. 

Unquestionably Neige is on my shortlist for top musical artists."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Yes. I first listened to Les Voyages and thought it was meh. Then, a few years later I stumbled upon ""Sur L'Ocean Couleur De Fer"" from Ecailles De Lune and it absolutely blew me away. At that point, I realized how wrong I was before and found the true beauty in Alcest's music. Their debut is now one of my Top 20 albums of all time."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Yeah i did, but live i thought they sounded too much like the records."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","I did actually. I'm still desiding if I like the new release. I've only gone over it scarcely when it first came out. Need to really feel it ya know? Like most things I eventually find something I like in something. "
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Give it another listen. At first I felt it was a really mediocre album but now I pretty much love all the songs on it other than Away. Try 'La Nuit avec Moi' and 'Délivrance.' The bonus track 'Into the Waves' is amazing too, and the lyrics are way darker than the music itself suggests."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","I liked the demo and the EP right away. When *Souvenirs d'un autre monde* came out I fucking hated it because I was expecting more along the lines of *Le Secret*. Upon returning to it several months later knowing what it was like I started to enjoy it. I liked *Écailles de lune* to some extent as well, but that's the last one I derived any real enjoyment from. Their last two have taken too radical a departure from even the early -gaze stuff to something that's... I don't know, it lacks the charm that was present on the previous albums."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Yep, in live at the Hellfest (2012)"
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Yes. I heard *Écailles de lune* and *Le Secret* right around the time the latter was re-released and I was blown away."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Yes!"
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Yes. Something about Alcest just clicked with me, and I've been obsessed ever since."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Well, I needed some time to love alcest as much as now but I already liked it when I first listened to it."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Yes"
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Eh, I liked Alcest when I first listened to it but it became less and less interesting. It was easy to, but just, pretty and not really my vibe."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","My first altercation with Alcest was when they released ""Souvenirs D'un Autre Monde"" and yes, I loved it from the very beginning. That album is fucking golden. 

Amesouers and Lantlôs is also very good, not that I think he's been so much involved in Lantlôs."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Still love ""Le Secret"" and ""Souvenirs"" but not much for his newer material. "
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Nah, dude. Doesn't hate itself enough."

"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","&gt;Alcest isn't a Black Metal band.

Oh fuck off, they used to be. They've made black metal music and they've made music heavily influenced by black metal. We can still talk about that music."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Clearly not CVLT enovgh you filthy casval. Have they bvrnt any chvrches or committed their souls eternally to satan? No? Then it's not trve Black Metal!!1 "
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","I fucking hate being such a filthy casual :'(

The only important question: Do they have influences other than black metal?

If so, they are not black metal."
"Did you like Alcest the first time you listened to them?","Every single black metal band on the planet has influences other than black metal."

Half of the Écailles de Lune album, particularly [Percées De Lumière ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-kW-rxzJ_0)

And then there was Les Voyages de l'Âme which had some *clearly* black metal tracks on it such as [Faiseurs de Mondes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE309orsgSA), which had blastbeats, screamed vocals, and tremolo-picked guitar leads.

And besides, OP didn't claim that Alcest are or were a black metal band. They don't need to be one for them to be relevant on this subreddit because their music is clearly on some level black metal-influenced, even if on their last album that influence is gone. This subreddit isn't just for pure black metal bands. Wolves in the Throne Room aren't *'just'* a black metal band, but that doesn't mean it isn't (or wasn't before they were blacklisted) relevant to post them here. Really tired of having the 'Is Alcest black metal?' argument every time they're posted/mentioned on this sub."

It's not even up for interpretation or discussion. Anyone who would deny that [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUUUbKCgNmU) is black metal doesn't know what black metal is--or is being willfully obstinate. "

"New to Black Metal: Any Suggestions?","I started listening with CoF, Behemoth, Mayhem, Forgotten Tomb, Dark Fortress, and Carach Angren, but my friends recently told me I should try Black Metal. So for a novice what bands would you recommend?"
"New to Black Metal: Any Suggestions?","If you like Mayhem, then I would recommend you move onto the other bands in the Norwegian scene. Burzum for starters, then check out Emperor, Gorgoroth, Darkthrone, and maybe Satyricorn. Grand Belial's Key is my personal favourite Black Metal band, so you may want to check them out. They have awesome riffs, pretty good lyrics, and they usually stray from the 'dark' atmosphere of Black Metal, and instead focus on blasphemy.

Bathory is also essential, so check out his self-titled album. Then maybe try Blood Fire Death. If you enjoyed the Viking portions, then check out Hammerheart, Blood on Ice, and the Nordland series. 

Let me know if you need a starting point for any of these musicians, or more recs. I would be glad to help."
"New to Black Metal: Any Suggestions?","&gt; arting point for any of these musicians, or m

Wow, great response, really do appreciate it! Always better to have a starting point than going in blind! =)"
"New to Black Metal: Any Suggestions?","No problem! For Burzum, I would suggest you begin with Filosofem. If you enjoyed that, then try Hvis Lyset Tar Oss.

For Emperor, listen to In the Nightside Eclipse.

For Darkthrone, if you enjoy Death Metal, then try A Blaze in the Northern Sky. If you're looking for a more pure BM record, then Transylvanian Hunger is good.

For Grand Belial's Key, begin with Judeobeast Assassination.

Let me know what you think, I hope you enjoy!"
"New to Black Metal: Any Suggestions?","Definitely agree with Judeobeast Assassination!"
"New to Black Metal: Any Suggestions?","Yes, I consider it probably the best USBM has to offer. It's certainly Grand Belial's Key's best album!"
"New to Black Metal: Any Suggestions?","Darkthrone."
"New to Black Metal: Any Suggestions?","Try Inquisition because they're awesome.

Revenge for a taste of war metal.

Raspberry bulbs/horrid cross/bone awl for some punky black metal

Pseudogod for some good black/death metal. Good listen if you're into Behemoth type stuff.

Syphilitic Vaginas/Morbid Insulter for thrash/black metal (kinda black and roll-ish) might also wanna check out G.I.S.M. if you like punk (the first album in particular)

Obviously there are a lot of good black metal to recommend, I wanna try to make a ""if you are new to black metal"" type post, might just take a while and some need of that post."
"New to Black Metal: Any Suggestions?","Also, if you like DSBM there is a dude on YouTube called Lightfox117 who makes great DSBM/Atmospheric black metal compilations."

"New to Black Metal: Any Suggestions?","Bathory &amp; Darkthrone"
"New to Black Metal: Any Suggestions?","Anaal Nathrakh's later stuff is mediocre imo but The Codex Necro is still one of my top black metal albums. It's necro as fuck and has a perfect vocal performance from V.I.T.R.I.O.L.

* Drudkh - ""Autumn Aurora"" [Ukrainian folk influences]
* Indian - ""From All Purity"" [abrasive blackened doom metal]
* Abigail Williams - ""Becoming"" [long, winding American black metal]
* Darkthrone - ""Transylvanian Hunter"" [classic Norwegian; very low production value with high tremolo]
* Deafheaven - ""Sunbather"" [contains shoegazing and post-rock influences; some purists do not consider it *real* black metal, but it's easy to get into]
* Leviathan - ""Verrater"" [2-disc demo collection of early-2000s/late-1990s atmospheric black metal]
* Emperor - ""In the Nightside Eclipse"" [archetype for symphonic black metal]
* Mayhem - ""De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas"" [quintessential Norwegian black metal]
* Bathory - ""Under the Sign of the Black Mark"" [quintessential Swedish* black metal]
* Nokturnal Mortum - ""To the Gates of Blasphemous Fire"" [Ukrainian folk influences]
* Venom - ""Black Metal"" [one of the earliest black metal albums; thrashy]
* Weakling - ""Dead As Dreams"" [extremely influential in American black metal; very long (15-20 minutes) songs]
* Waldgefluster - ""Mein Fesseln"" [German folk influences]
* Burzum - ""Filosofem"" and ""Burzum"" [quintessential Norwegian black metal]
* Immortal - ""Pure Holocaust"" [lo-fi Norwegian]

"What's 'Norsecore'?","Norsecore is a pejorative term for blasty, fast, would-be-thrashy-if-it-wasn't-played-at-400-bpm black metal. Oft-cited examples include [Tsjuder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE5QekLPjEg) and [Marduk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZskXIVgIkEE), who are actually Swedish."
"What's 'Norsecore'?","Well to be fair, Swedes were Norsemen also."
"What's 'Norsecore'?","I personally don't see how it's pejorative. I think Norsecore is a badass name for a genre. It's pretty fitting of Marduk. Is it an example of classic Norwegian racism haha? They appear to view Swedes like the Scottish view the English."
"What's 'Norsecore'?","I don't think it's pejorative either. That wasn't an opinion, I was just describing the context in which Norsecore was originally used. Yeah, there is playful inter-Scandinavian rivalry and certainly that exists in bm, but that's not really what this is about. It's more about people who aren't a fan of this type of black metal deriding it based on those features. It's been embraced by people who like the style to some extent, but you're more liable to see somebody using it to make fun of a band than to describe themselves as a ""Norsecore fan""."

"Greetings, I'm looking to expand my musical tastes into Black Metal","In my teenage years I developed a love for metal. Anything I could get my hands on I would listen to. That stopped over the years as I found hip-hop (Aesop Rock, Eyedea, Brother Ali, El-P, so on and so forth) and fell out of the metal scene for quite some time. Feeling nostalgic I decided to listen to Cradle of Filth's song ""Babalon A.D."" and immediately remembered my love for the genre. I was wondering, and I'm sorry if there is some sort of post I over-looked, if you guys could help me find bands like them? 

The thing that I loved about Cradle of Filth were how melodic/symphonic their compositions were. With Dani Filths amazing highs and the backing of female vocals on some tracks, mixed with crazy drums and dark riffs, and the lyricism (well, the few things I could understand anyway) absolutely made them a powerhouse in my opinion. I understand they fell off years ago in terms of musicality and and whatnot, but albums like Midian and Damnation and a Day remain some of my favorite albums of any genre. 

Sorry for getting lost, the point is, could any of you help me find bands that are similar? Thank you for your time.  "
"Greetings, I'm looking to expand my musical tastes into Black Metal","I don't listen to CoF, but it seems like you may enjoy Symphonic Black Metal. A good starting for Black Metal in general also happens to be a Symphonic BM band: Emperor. Listen to ""In the Nightside Eclipse"" by Emperor, it's a pretty good album. High usage of keyboards, and it's considered essential in the Black Metal scene. [Sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgQRRI9goFg). 


From there, keep looking for Symphonic Black Metal bands. If you enjoy Emperor, I would be glad to give further recommendations."
"Greetings, I'm looking to expand my musical tastes into Black Metal","You may try Ancient. Not really into them myself, but their album ""The Cainian Chronicle"" has some female vocals in it. "
"Greetings, I'm looking to expand my musical tastes into Black Metal","There are a bunch of Band names in the sidebar. They are blacklisted because they are the great names of the genre. Check those out. I think if you started with Cradle of Filth, then Dimmu Borgir would be a very good next step. Especially the album Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia."
"Greetings, I'm looking to expand my musical tastes into Black Metal","I'd recommend Gangrene by Mirrorthone as a decent entry point for you since you like the symphonic stuffs and that album is as good as Symphonic BM gets it my opinion. If you like that you can grab some Emperor,  Carach Angren,  Dimmu Borgir, In Sorte Diaboli is the only album of theirs that has grabbed me personally, and Old Mans Child. Beyond the symphonic though I'd recommend the following to help you pick a style to dig into before covering the rest

Trashy stuff: Immortal- Sons of Northern Darkness and Destroyer 666- Cold Steel... For an Iron Age

Traditional Second Wave: Darkthrone- A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Mayhem- Deathcrush

""Atmospheric"": Agalloch- The Mantle and Ulver- Bergtatt

""Epic"": Summoning- Stronghold and Caladan Brood- echoes of Battle

Ambient: Darkspace- Dark Space II and Paysage d'Hiver- Das Tor 

Viking: Bathory- Blood on Ice and Windir- Antonir


And some other cool albums that I think make good entry points; Tsjuder- Desert Northern Hell, Wormlust- The Feral Wisdom, Marduk- Panzer Division Marduk, and Craft- Fuck the Universe ( the album that turned me onto the genre) "
"Greetings, I'm looking to expand my musical tastes into Black Metal","If you love the symphonies associated with the genre, then you should check out the band Malevolentia and Ira Diaboli. "
"Greetings, I'm looking to expand my musical tastes into Black Metal","The most similar band I know is Anorexia Nervosa (except on their first album, Exile).
Although somewhat less similar, you may also like the albums Hermh - Angeldemon, Lucifugum - Нахристихрящах, and, if you don't mind a good deal of weirdness, Ebonylake - In Swathes of Brooding Light."
"Greetings, I'm looking to expand my musical tastes into Black Metal","If you like melodic stuff I would recommend Anorexia Nervosa, Carach Angren, Rotting Christ, Eyes of Noctum, Negura Bunget, Dordeduh, Gris, and Sombres Forêts though the last two are leaning more towards DSBM. You might also enjoy Atmospheric Black Metal and Drudkh in particular."

"Question about Black Metal genre","I rarely listen to Black Metal since I don't like the depressing feel I get after listening to it after a while.

BUT. I heard this absolutely **EPIC** sort of Black Metal song. And I'm curious if this is a sub genre or you know more songs like that, so here it goes: The song I heard lasted very long, the screaming was constant, very raspy and ongoing. There was some kind of flute instrument played. The guitar played long outdrawn power-chords almost exclusively, and the drumming was extreme and intense. It gave me a chilling feeling I very rarely get when listening to music, and I listen to lots of different music. But this song just gave me a sensation of feeling like I was back in time where there was Vikings and Dragons out in the wilderness. It was the most athmospheric music I've probably heard in my life. So PLAESE can someone tell me what this may have been?

(Yeah I know its a long question, but I NEED to know because It gaves me chills all the way till the end and I really want to listen to more lik this) Thanks."

"Looking for specific recommendations!","Hi, I'm looking for recommendations.  
  
Examples of bands I like: Burzum, Darkthrone (especially Hate Them/Sardonic Wrath), Rotting Christ, Summoning, Ulver, some Ildjarn, Make a Change... Kill Yourself, Mystic Forest/Eikenskaden, Blut Aus Nord, first Immortal album and more.  
  
**Some things I am interested in:**  
 - Lyrics about solitude, love/loss, emptiness, nature, regret, pain etc... Basically more introspective/personal as opposed to satanic, aggressive, or evil.  
 - Focus on melody and ambience  
 - Synthesizers (complimentary like Burzum, Summoning, or Isengard, not at the forefront like Dimmu Borgir)  
 - Bands who sound original or unique  
 - Bands with either raw or clean production and sound  
 - Bands that potentially use industrial/electronic elements (I am a big fan of Ulver's later electronic work, and Mysticum's electronic elements for example)  
  
**Some things I am not interested in:**  
 - Anything with mostly blastbeats, or blastbeats faster than the average Fenriz/Vikernes 'half speed' blastbeat  
 - Anything that is overly angry, satanic (as in Gorgoroth satanic, not Darkthrone satanic), or based around shock value  
 - Anything that focuses too much on viking lyrics or image   
 - Anything that focuses more on pummeling as opposed to melody and ambience.  
 - Anything overly 'folky'

"I recently released a new song with my one-man-band, KARAKUM. Any feedback is appreciated.","As you asked for feedback:  
1. The drums during the first part are monotonous and, hell, they run amok. Had this problem with double base, too, when using a drum computer :) perhaps you'll like to adjust that.  
2. A bit more variety in the growls could add an extra touch. As an idea.  
Besides that: nice approach! I like melody and riffs. Will buy this later when not on a mobile device, so despite 1. you see it was still worth listening ;)"
"I recently released a new song with my one-man-band, KARAKUM. Any feedback is appreciated.","Thanks! I totally see where you're coming from on the drum parts, this is my first experience with programmed drums. I'll probably clean them up on the EP I'm planing. I have some other songs where I use some different type of growls, maybe I'll incorporate them more. 
I appreciate the feedback! "
"I recently released a new song with my one-man-band, KARAKUM. Any feedback is appreciated.","This is pretty good. It kind of reminds me of Nae'blis actually, which is great. What drum software are you using? Unrelated to the music, I don't really care for the logo too much. Would you consider a redesign (by me)?"
"I recently released a new song with my one-man-band, KARAKUM. Any feedback is appreciated.","Thanks! I use the EzDrummer plugin with FL Studio. I dont like the logo either tbh, I just threw it together just to have a logo. Hmm, that depends! Do you have a link to other logos you've made, and do you have a fee?"
"I recently released a new song with my one-man-band, KARAKUM. Any feedback is appreciated.","Good song mate. 

The only feedback that I have is on the drums. You are using a cheap computer drum machine and it sounds like it. Consider using drum software like battery 3, this would give you much better range of variability of how how each strike of the kit could sound. Also, your machine gun drum pattern could be beefed up a little bit. Consider running those parts through some compression, distortion, and delay.  

Cheers"
"I recently released a new song with my one-man-band, KARAKUM. Any feedback is appreciated.","It is one man metal, though. Bad drum machine is sort of the name of the game."

"I recently released a new song with my one-man-band, KARAKUM. Any feedback is appreciated.","I dug it,  I'd have to agree with others on the drums,  sounded pretty metallic and harsh, but still awesome riffs, sweeping guitars, vocals were pretty good.  Interesting lyrical choice with the Poe poem,  I like it. Keep it up!  \m/"
"I recently released a new song with my one-man-band, KARAKUM. Any feedback is appreciated.","AFAIR EZdrummer has a built in humanizer function. Sounds like you've disabled it. If you put a little effort into mixing, EQing and effects, EZdrummer can sound pretty decent actually.
Vocals sound a bit too 'held back' for my taste, but they aren't bad.

Apart from that, I like the song quite a lot! Those riffs are pretty catchy (in a good, non-annoying way)."
"I recently released a new song with my one-man-band, KARAKUM. Any feedback is appreciated.","Besides what everyone has already mentioned about the drums (which imo aren't even that bad), this is really great. I particularly love the hypnotic sound, and the ending is gorgeous. :)"

The Norse (and Norse-inspired) wave of black metal in the 90s is kind of a different beast from Venom, but Bathory is the dominant influence on most of that music, which is really the canon of what we call black metal. Burzum, Darkthrone, Immortal, Emperor, Mayhem, Beherit, Gorgoroth, Enslaved. "

...And that's it. And i've already grown out of the new Spectral Lore album. Nothing good has really come out recently, except for the new Goatmoon. If you like Atmoblack, then I guess this is a good year. Nothing good in terms of legit BM though. I guess Black Metal is a dying genre, replaced by 'Blackgaze'."

All solid (especially the Death Fortress) non-atmoblack, though as you mentioned there was a ton of good atmoblack. I haven't even been following black metal this year very closely (big death metal year for me) and I know that there are some good releases that I really liked. 

Maybe just start flicking through the Fallen Empire catalog? "

"A few favorites from my collection",""
"A few favorites from my collection","Images 1-9 are of the 7xLP box set of Deathspell Omega's later body of work. Seven picture discs, each emblazoned with the sumptuous artwork of each album/EP they have released since 2004. Contains a 60+ page ""psalter"" with the lyrics of each album in chronological order.

Images 10-11 is the of the same artist, the EP-Kénôse, released 2005, contains a 30+ booklet of original artwork.

Image 12 is ""The Mantle"" from Agalloch, An atmospheric, and deeply melancholy treasure, released in 2002.

Images 13-15 comes from Murmuüre. This one-man project of a Frenchman calling himself ""One,"" came out in 2010 in extremely limited releases. The album is filled with beautiful moments. Murmuure's melodies--if you can call them that--move with a logic that is totally their own, pulling the drums far beyond conventional time and rhythm, the album completely transcends formula, this is an exciting piece of music to have and behold!

Images 16-17 are of the self titled LP from Lurker of Chalice. Depressive, and deeply twisted. If you like your music dark, I cannot recommend this album enough. A true underground gem from start to finish.

Image 18 is the blood red vinyl edition of Leviathan's album- Massive Conspiracy Against All Life. A blazing torrent of distorted vocals and suicidal riffs, fueled by bad drugs and misanthropy. This album is simply the final nail in christ's coffin.

19-20 are again from the Portland based dark metal outfit known as Agalloch. This is their album ""Marrow of the Spirit"" which came on clear grey vynil, released in 2010. Seeing them playing a live show, it is clear that they have a mastery of their sound. Truly talented musicians, and an essential listen for all types of music lovers.

Lastly, is the red-green split vinyl of Leviathans ""The Blind Wound"". Truly one of the shining moments of his extremely prolific musical career, spanning over 20 quality releases.

I would have liked to show a little more variety from my collection, but these pics were already on my PC, and pulling them out is kind of a chore. 


Support the artists that inspire you!

"Help branching out on black metal?","[deleted]"
"Help branching out on black metal?","Check out agalloch. "
"Help branching out on black metal?","I found my way into blacker stuff via bands that mix traditional black metal with other genres:

**Enslaved** are easy to get into. A bit of a progressive sound, with their style changing quite a bit between the years.

**Rotting Christ** and **Melechesh** have a very riff-driven and melodic style to their music, but not to their detriment. Really good stuff.

**Dark Fortress** and **Septic Flesh** are a bit more atmospheric in some of their songs, especially the later albums.

Others have recommended **Immortal** and I have to agree. At the Heart of Winter is definitely a good starting point.

Edit: Also check out the bands in the sidebar. They're blacklisted for a reason - because so many people love their music."
"Help branching out on black metal?","I prefer the German black metal.

minus the NSBM, the anarchist black metal. and all the neo nazi black metal.

just cant handle that shit.
But the more melodic german black metal is what I like to hear.

I cant quite remember any specifically I used to listen to, but I think Fyrnask might be german. Lantlos is german(they are more DSBM) Wandar is german i think. Coldworld might be german? cant remember.
Yea I obviously like the darker side of black metal. 

Heres one i dont hear often here. Mammal - Altar of Plagues.

such a fucking sick album instrumentally. And the message the band is portraying lyrically is something ive kind of connected to for a long time.

oooooooohhhh The new Darkspace album is really good. its a bit different, but i Love it. Everything that dude makes is really good. but his band Darkspace is my favorite. Especialy after the last album"
"Help branching out on black metal?","&gt;minus the NSBM, the anarchist black metal. and all the neo nazi black metal

"Help branching out on black metal?","Maybe if most of it didnt sound like shit id listen to it."
"Help branching out on black metal?","Gimme some examples of what you've heard. The only reason I can think of for not liking most NSBM bands if you like other black metal is if raw production isn't your thing, but I don't know why you'd be in a black metal sub if it's not."
"Help branching out on black metal?","Ive mostly just rummaged through blog/album posts on random websites. A lot of it was really underground I guess. More local to their areas and online and shit. Sometimes the lyrics and songnames and shit are humurous to me, but eeh.

I dont mind the raw production, I just prefer DSBM and more solid sounding melodic black metal is all.And by that, No i dont mean bands like Alcest or deafheaven. I cant fucking stand that shit.

I guess my favorite shittily produced album is by Barghest. The self titled one. shit is fucking sick dude.

and holy fuck I almost forgot Strid. old strid. Some Grimlair is good to me also. I liked some of those french bands."
"Help branching out on black metal?","Do you want recommendations? There's good stuff out there that you've probably been missing out on."

"Help branching out on black metal?","You got the audacity part right. Im sure thats obvious to anyone, but its layers of the same song mixed together at different speeds. Like the original song I composed that out of was just a short acoustic riff I played. 
Just an overly post edited acoustic guitar track hahaha

Its more complicated than that explanation, trust me. My main concern as of lately, is to try and 'polish' my sounds a bit more so they sound clearer and better. better ratios and shit. Ive only been recording and producing for about 2 years now so im still in my diapers."
"Help branching out on black metal?","I record everything on a cheap 4-track. I can't do much in the way of polishing."
"Help branching out on black metal?","Id kill to have a 4 track dude. 
I mean, all my polishing goes in once its recorded. So the recording is really just me trying to find something that fits the mood at the right time, but also sounds good enough to be turned into something else.

I dont have any keyboards or anything either. Just guitars and, whatever other noises i can find.
Ive made a song using a microwave, and some generated/edited sounds"
"Help branching out on black metal?","I just have a Tascam Porta 02 mkII. They're like 30 bucks on ebay. Pretty limited functionality, but if you're looking to put sound on a tape it's the cheapest way to do it (unless you want to bounce tracks between regular cassette decks or use a shitty little memo recorder). If you're not totally broke, though, you should definitely look into something with more inputs, XLR inputs, and the ability to EQ. All I can do is pan and adjust volume, and I have to do weird shit with whatever PAs and interfaces I can borrow if I want to use real mics/more than two mics."

"Circle of Ouroborus - Shadows Lead - [6:51]",""
"Angrepp - Hellführer's Fuckcunt (2014) [Sweden]",""
"Aufschwung - By The Fallen Leaves (М8Л8ТХ cover)",""
"Aufschwung - By The Fallen Leaves (М8Л8ТХ cover)","The clean percussion is a bit weird on top of the very lo-fi vocals and guitars, but I really dig this cover. This is one of my favorite NSBM songs, and probably one of the more popular ones in the Russian underground."
"Acherontas - Theosis",""
"Sacrificium Carmen - Sanansaattaja",""
"Kriegsmaschine - Onward Destrudo",""
"Kriegsmaschine - Onward Destrudo","I'm so glad this got posted. The Polish scene is so raw and has such a sick, aggressive sound, but I barely hear about anything except Behemoth."
"Kriegsmaschine - Onward Destrudo","I agree. I am really enjoying Polish black metal lately. Mgla is one of my all time favorites."
"Kriegsmaschine - Onward Destrudo","Same here, by the way, Mgla share members with Kriegsmaschine and they lately became one of my favorite black metal bands, Enemy Of Man sucked me in like no other album within the genre, when I first heard None Shall See Redemption it was love. 

Furia is another great polish bm band.
There is actually a lot of good stuff coming from there, I wasn't even aware that a lot of the bands I like come from poland."
"Kriegsmaschine - Onward Destrudo","Plaga is another great band from the polish scene."
"Minenwerfer - Dragoner der Südfront (2014)",""
"Minenwerfer - Dragoner der Südfront (2014)","Great song"
"Chaos Moon - Hymn To Inquity",""
"Marduk - Rope of Regret. New track of the coming ablum Front Schwein!",""
"Marduk - Rope of Regret. New track of the coming ablum Front Schwein!","All hail the panzer division!"
"Ascension- With Burning Tongues",""
"Ascension- With Burning Tongues","I really dig this band, but their last full length didn't do much for me. I should spend some more time with it."
"Stagnant Waters - ""Algae""",""
"Vyrion - Pit (2014) [Australia]",""
"Striborg - Within the Depths of Darkness and Sorrow",""
"Just reading an old decibel best of 2011 list, this album should have been #1",""
"Just reading an old decibel best of 2011 list, this album should have been #1","Viva La Sale Famine de Valfunde."
"Just reading an old decibel best of 2011 list, this album should have been #1","Quite possibly one of my favourite Peste Noire albums (which is saying something!) And this song...goddamn. "
"Just reading an old decibel best of 2011 list, this album should have been #1","If you had to ask me to pick a favourite or death, I'd choose death. Each one has its own unique sort of style whilst remaining exactly as pure peste noire as the rest"
"Just reading an old decibel best of 2011 list, this album should have been #1","You see, I said ""one of my favourite"" ... and I'm pretty sure that I'd say the same about every one of their albums. ;) 

I do love KPN for the fact that everything they put out is unique to everything else they've done. I can't wait to see what they're going to release next. "
"Just reading an old decibel best of 2011 list, this album should have been #1","I do see. I have the same problem with all my favourite bands heh. whatever form their next release ends up taking, it'll be insane. 

favourite song's an easy one though, tied between title track of Folkfuck Folie and La Condi Hu from this album "
"Just reading an old decibel best of 2011 list, this album should have been #1","I've actually been quietly dying of excitement ever since they mentioned they were back in studio. 

Haha I think La Condi Hu is my least favourite from L'Ordure. :P I definitely couldn't pick a favourite song overall. In *that* case, I'd absolutely rather die. "
"Just reading an old decibel best of 2011 list, this album should have been #1","only thing I'd be more excited for is if DsO announced some new shit. 

Different strokes and all that, I mean, every other song is tied second heh. We must be wired different to eachother, super easy for me to pick songs I prefer off an album, can't pick between albums. "
"Just reading an old decibel best of 2011 list, this album should have been #1","Differences of opinion are what make the world a beautiful place. We're yin and yang, light and dark, God and Satan. Basically if you smush the two of us together, you'll get the most perfect being in creation. :P"
"Just reading an old decibel best of 2011 list, this album should have been #1","I am way too sleepy to be equally poetic (or even really literate) at this time of the morning, so if you'll settle for a ""0____o  you're damn right you would..."" then that works for me :P Have a good one! "
"New Diagnose:Lebensgefahr Material","In an update a few days ago to the [official site of Nattramn](http://humanianimaliliberati.com/), musician behind such projects as Silencer and Diagnose:Lebensgefahr, a new edition of the 2007 album ""Transformalin"" was announced.

Included in this vinyl edition are 3 new songs, which were recorded alongside Transformalin but never made the cut to the final album:

* ""Utsikt Ifrån Botten"", which translates to ""View from the Ocean's Floor"", is the first song written under Diagnose:Lebensgefahr, and carries Silencer-like aspects to it. You can hear part of this song when visiting the [official Diagnose:Lebensgefahr site](http://www.diagnoselebensgefahr.com/).

* ""Obducenten Har Vaknat"", which translates to ""Mortician's Awakening"", is the counterpart to the song [""Obducentens Dröm"", or ""Mortician's Dream""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t76p6MHyGl0).

* ""När Livet Slås Sönder"", which translates to ""As Life is Smashed to Pieces"", is the other new track on the album. Little information is given on the actual site.

Only 500 copies of the album are currently on sale, and I was wondering if anyone on this sub had ordered a copy. I'd certainly be interested in hearing the new tracks, as a big fan of the original Transformalin."
"New Diagnose:Lebensgefahr Material","I'm excited for this but it's getting kind of irritating that all they've been doing is re-releasing Transformalin over and over again for some time. I fucking love Nattramn's work but I'd like to hear some new stuff as well. 
I know this vinyl edition has three extra songs but when I mean new stuff I mean a new album, book, band, etc.

If you haven't heard his demo of Ödelagt (under the name Trencadis) I recommend it bigtime. I got it off of discogs and it was worth the time I had to wait."
"New Diagnose:Lebensgefahr Material","Yeah, it kinda sucks to see Nattramn stuck on the one project - the user [14words](https://www.flashback.org/u298248) on Flashback apparently has connections with Nattramn, and states that he is slowly working on a new music project [this was from around the time of the release of Grishjarta]. 

I've listened to Ödelagt, and although it's a very masterful ambient work, once again it is just re-released old material. From what I gather his mental state has improved massively, but with this came decreased creativity."
"New Diagnose:Lebensgefahr Material","I'm happy to hear that he's working on more music. Everything he has done is fantastic and I listen to it very often. I'm also happy that his mental state is much better and I hope that one day he'll do interviews and such. Maybe he could put all the bullshit Silencer rumors to rest."
"New Diagnose:Lebensgefahr Material","Either way, I'm ordering a copy of the new revision of Transformalin, else it'll take months to appear on YouTube. "
"New Diagnose:Lebensgefahr Material","[Pre-orders start 6th February, get hype](http://humanianimaliliberati.com/images/vinyl_promos.jpg)"
"New Diagnose:Lebensgefahr Material","Fuck, I don't have the money currently. I guess I'll have to wait for it to end up on discogs."
"New Diagnose:Lebensgefahr Material","Absolutely - it's such a shame that all his work is surrounded by rumours and stories trying to make him out as anything other than an extremely gifted musician.

Yes, he has anxiety and has produced some dark work. No, that does not make him a psychotic murderer with pig hooves for hands."

"Leviathan - Epoch Of Surcease (The Secretion Of Funerals)",""
"Leviathan - Epoch Of Surcease (The Secretion Of Funerals)","I read an interview with Jef Whitehead that said he has hundreds of unreleased demos of Leviathan material. I wish I could hear those. "
"Leviathan - Epoch Of Surcease (The Secretion Of Funerals)","I want to get the one he just released with Krieg(I believe it was)"
"Leviathan - Epoch Of Surcease (The Secretion Of Funerals)","I just heard Krieg for the first time recently. I enjoyed it thoroughly."
"Leviathan - Epoch Of Surcease (The Secretion Of Funerals)","For me, Leviathan has really been hit-or-miss... This track is great."
"Leviathan - Epoch Of Surcease (The Secretion Of Funerals)","I agree with both statements. "

"I took a picture of an lake in finland on a gray winter day listening to this. I have never felt more finnish in my life. Wanted share the experience. So, Cosmic church - mysteeriverhoon kietoutunut. (the photo in the comments)","Could you recommend some of this grim pop? When I lived in Finland the radio seemed to play the same music as anywhere else."

So, Cosmic church - mysteeriverhoon kietoutunut. (the photo in the comments)","I can try.. hmm.. There is [Viikate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTMkDdakelo), [Kotiteollisuus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd8w6VBYDHM), [Chisu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOsW6BHzrD8) (lyrics are grim but I don't know if you understand them, she sings that there is nothing left in her other than the need to inflict pain and the need to feel pain. Pain is not strong enough word though. Torture would have the right nyance. ), [Jenni Vartiainen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJJeG6rtzs), again lyrics are grim but... Then there is older songs like (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BXSkigN45w) wich basically tells about drinking and axe murdering the family (From the cold soil a cold eye stares, and the axe rises high; from between the mounds and the soils forfathers look proudly upon their sons: unemployment, booze, axe and the family. The cold snow, police and the last mistake) (. Or even older (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N-WWDvxiO0) It's all the same when you will die (because black roses are always blooming in tuonela (afterworld)) "

"I took a picture of an lake in finland on a gray winter day listening to this. I have never felt more finnish in my life. Wanted share the experience. So, Cosmic church - mysteeriverhoon kietoutunut. (the photo in the comments)","No worries, really. I really like to post music that I like to listen. If you want to understand some song better I can translate it for you if i have the time and yes, alcohol. Now that  I said it and being intoxicated, here are lyrics for that kotiteollisuus song:

Between the moon and the sun

There a creature is, with

Face of a snake and,

shreads of an angel.

Is that all that is lef of me?

Where was I when I still could fly?

Wind has grown

It beats our flags brutally

Wind has grown

Blowing over the forests and lands

d

chorus/start

d

Under this sky the wind blows

Without an equal it rages

And a little human prays

But a pray is just empty words on the wind

The is no one to hear it

And even if someday a God is found

He will not recognize me as his child

d

chorus/end

d

From the fathoms of oblivion rises

to the sky as gray as iron

flocks of birds

As the wind blows dust upon us

I am a fraid of death

There is no one walking abow waters in this world

I am afraid of death and afraid to live here.

(they might not be totally correct or even well written but as I said I'm intoxicated)"
