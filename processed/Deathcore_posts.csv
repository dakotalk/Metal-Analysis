"Heaven shall burn - Combat [3:59]","Wouldnt really call it deathcore, still a fucking great song, their lyrics are awesome."
"Heaven shall burn - Combat [3:59]","What would you call it?"
"Heaven shall burn - Combat [3:59]","Melodic Death Metal"
"Heaven shall burn - Combat [3:59]","not that melodic honestly.. And they're labeled as deathcore tho. But Opinions I guess"
"Heaven shall burn - Combat [3:59]","[They're Melo Death and not Deathcore.](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Heaven_Shall_Burn/3010)"
"Heaven shall burn - Combat [3:59]","hmm never heard of dat, anyway thx chap"
"Heaven shall burn - Combat [3:59]","Good song tho, dont get me wrong, I rly like HSB"
"Heaven shall burn - Combat [3:59]","HSB is pretty unique and it's hard to put them in a specific category. Most people i know label them simple deathcore and i would say they're a mix of melodic death metal and metalcore."
"Heaven shall burn - Combat [3:59]","The first time I listened to the song was the first time I saw the video.
I cried my eyes out, honestly. That video is such a crewl work of art..

Had to rewatch it a few times to take everything in.. and even now I don't get tired of watching that video - ever."

"Chelsea Grin - The Foolish One [3:42]","Best Chelsea Grin album."
"Chelsea Grin - The Foolish One [3:42]","I want to see these guys live soon in Philadelphia.  What are their shows like live?  What songs do they play/arepopular.    "
"Chelsea Grin - The Foolish One [3:42]","Definitely go. They are good live, more so when they aren't on warped tour (I didn't enjoy their warped performance as much). As far as songs go I've never not heard them play recreant, usually they stick to the popular ones and throw in some random ones. All of them are good.  "
"Chelsea Grin - The Foolish One [3:42]","their shows in canada have always been violent as fuck. you can go back and find videos of chelsea playing 4/20 at mavericks in ottawa, and find adam warren doing vocals for the whole desolation of eden set list because alex broke his jaw. (THEY BROKE HIS JAWWW~!) i remember one time i saw them it was in a venue maybe 3/4 the size of a football field or something. 2 pits one at the very front one at the very back, somehow there was a massive clusterfuck and they merged full of given at least 50 guys throwing down in a tight packed place. was nuts. "
"Chelsea Grin - The Foolish One [3:42]","Woah, that fucking brutal.  I have to go now.  "
"Chelsea Grin - The Foolish One [3:42]","don't get your hopes up, i stayed for half their set a few years ago, alex was constantly out of breath and sounded like daffy duck "
"Chelsea Grin - The Foolish One [3:42]","Alex is much much better now than he was a few years ago."
"Chelsea Grin - The Foolish One [3:42]","Its awesome my past experiences made you change your mind. Have fun my dude"
"Chelsea Grin - The Foolish One [3:42]","saw that tour in hamilton, best chelsea grin show hands down"
"Chelsea Grin - The Foolish One [3:42]","Crewcabanger and Recreant off their first album are, imo, their most known songs. I don't know much about them though, so I can't really help with your question."
"Chelsea Grin - The Foolish One [3:42]","Their vocalist loves taking pictures and shitting around with the crowd so have fun!"

Pillars warms you up, we bow crushes your balls, then it calms down to a dark chug.  Then all eyes brings it back up to the insanity we are used to with VoM, particularly the first 20 seconds or so.  Song stays strong and wild but does a slow taper.  The mood of this string of songs is like twin peaks.  Slow ascent, sheer ascent, peak, long gradual descent, sheer ascent, peak, small drop, ridgeline, descent.  I really like it, and have listened to it many times."

"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","Chelsea Grin has been my favorite band for a very long time but since Evolve they already went downhill and now with Ashes to Ashes even more IMO. I really loved all their previous work (My Damnation, DoE, Self-Titled) but i really can't get into Ashes to Ashes, which annoys me since it's my favorite band. 
So I wonder, which are the heaviest songs on the album opinion and which are your favorite songs? I wana give the album another try."
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","Some of the best advice i can give is give Born of Osiris a real good listen, everything from The Discovery backwards(not that TWDA is bad!)

It helps you appreciate Jason Richardsons input into the newer CG stuff. They've definitely moved on a bit from the more brutal deathcore sound, but it's all still great!"
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","I really like Born of Osiris but I just wish Chelsea Grin wouldn't have changed to that style. If I want to hear that kind of style I listen to BOO. When I listen to Chelsea Grin I just preffer to hear something less melodic and more brutal/heavy... :("
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","Check out the albums Jason Richardson did with All Shall Perish. They're brutal as dicks dawg."
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","I know those man, they're amazing!"
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","Easily some of his best work, and so impressive given how young he was at the time. I think the first album he did with them came out when he was 18 or 19. I was pretty stoked to hear they're getting back together for new material and tours, with a brand new vocalist as well. Gonna be sick."
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","What albums did he record for? Looking up ASP's discog and I can't seem to see him in any of the personnel notes. I know he briefly toured with them, but was unaware he recorded some of their material and would like to check it out."
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","If you dont like, you dont like it. Move on."
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","Ashes to ashes is just a shit album. My main gripe is that the lyrics are terrible and Alex Koehler really over-enunciates almost every word.

I DONT WANT TO BE YOU

I DONT WANT TO SEE YOU

blah blah blah *cringe*

It's really disappointing after their Evolve EP, because I thought that was their best work yet."
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","IMO Self-Titled, DoE and My Damnation are their best work. Not so into the other stuff. Still can't believe how disappointing Ashes to Ashes is, was the album I looked the most foreward to in 2014..."
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","I 100% agree with you. The lyrics sound like some 14 year old emo girl wrote them. Evolve was also my favorite work they've ever done too."
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","The lyrics are terrible!! I feel like they did fine instrumentally but even then the breakdowns are weak and forced, if you can even call them that. "
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","Yeah I mean the album is still heavy, and the guitar solos are awesome, but I just can't get around the shitty emo lyrics. Basically every song is ""oh look at us, we're really hardcore, fuck the police, get drunk""
"
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","If Alex would have stepped up the album would probably be a 9~10 for me. Hopefully next album.."
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","Theres been a ton of bands i like the first album and sometimes dont like the others, just keep listening to it, eventually you may like it like i do. 

Bands change, cant expect the sound sound from every album. "
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","Its not really a heavy album I feel.. But when it comes to favorite songs on the album I rly like ""Playing with fire"" cause of the rythm it has."
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","Really? I feelike this album is there best yet"
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","I agree I like it, but can't say best. I will always be a My Damnation guy. "
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","See for my im not a fan of my damnatiom because of how his vocals sound on that one"
"Can't get into Chelsea Grin Ashes to Ashes...","I think his lows were at its best in My damnation. Also I sorta like his shreiking highs. But oh well"

"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Rings of Saturn"
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","I listed RoS as one of the ones I've already heard. "
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Into Infernus - The End of Eden

In Chasms Deep - Symphony of Horror

^ For all your black metal/deathcore needs.

There's also Headwound The Pony's Merchant of Misery, which I think came out this year. It's pretty sick if you ask me.

And Attila has a new album, if you're into that. It's pretty alright imo, but I never *assume* anyone likes Attila, so there's that. 

And although it's not out yet, AngelMaker's debut is coming out around Christmas time, so if you want aboard this hype train you're welcome with open arms."
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","&gt;Into Infernus - The End of Eden
In Chasms Deep - Symphony of Horror

Well the first one is listed as black metal, so I don't think that ones going to do me any good. And I don't see the other one on [this list](https://rateyourmusic.com/customchart?page=1&amp;chart_type=top&amp;type=album&amp;year=2014&amp;genre_include=1&amp;include_child_genres=1&amp;genres=Deathcore&amp;include_child_genres_chk=1&amp;include=both&amp;origin_countries=&amp;limit=none&amp;countries=). 

&gt;There's also Headwound The Pony's Merchant of Misery, which I think came out this year. It's pretty sick if you ask me.

[2012](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/headwound_the_pony/the_merchant_of_misery/). 

&gt;And Attila has a new album, if you're into that. It's pretty alright imo, but I never assume anyone likes Attila, so there's that.

Attila are metalcore, and I'm definitely not a fan. 

&gt;And although it's not out yet, AngelMaker's debut is coming out around Christmas time, so if you want aboard this hype train you're welcome with open arms.

AngelMaker are the shit. I knew they had an album coming, but I didn't know it was so soon. I guess I've got to get more familiar with their EP. 


"
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Into Infernus is a fusion of black metal and deathcore, and are worth checking out for fans of either. Same with In Chasms Deep. But shit, if they're not on the list, I guess you're not allowed to listen to it huh."
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Don't worry OP is being kind of a dick"
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","You know you've fucked up when YoloSwag4Jesus420fgt calls you a dick. That's gotta sting yo."
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","I'll check them out at some point, but I am looking for stuff that's primarily deathcore. Like, if you can't post the majority of the songs on the album on this sub it's not what I'm looking for. 

It would probably help to clarify though. I spend my time rating shit on rateyourmusic, the site that list is from, and I'm looking to knock out as many deathcore ratings as I can by the end of the year. I'm finishing up my metalcore backlog atm and my dm one next batch. "
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Obliterationist, Ovid's Withering, Shadow Of The Colossus.

The future of deathcore right there."
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","None of those are from this year though. "
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Well excuse me for trying to give you some suggestions then."
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","I'm not trying to be rude, but I did ask for stuff from this year. 

&gt;What from [this list](https://rateyourmusic.com/customchart?page=1&amp;chart_type=top&amp;type=album&amp;year=2014&amp;genre_include=1&amp;include_child_genres=1&amp;genres=Deathcore&amp;include_child_genres_chk=1&amp;include=both&amp;origin_countries=&amp;limit=none&amp;countries=) is must hear? I've heard some of it already.

Was my post. and I listed what I'd already heard from it. "
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","So music from *any other year* that you haven't heard is off-limits? Ok."
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","For the purpose of this thread? Yes. 

I'm trying to know what deathcore from 2014 is important that I've missed. That's the whole point of my post. "
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","I love Attila,not all the time,but they're fun to jam once in a while. Just fun music. New album is alright,wish it was as heavy as About That Life but still okay."
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","The new album is actually in a lower tuning, but the reason it feels less heavy is because the breakdowns are more hardcore-oriented. A lot of syncopated, 2-step riffs. About That Life was more about the groove, and that the vocals were more metal-centric, it's much heavier overall. 

The new album is kind of confusing imo. I like most of it, but a lot of it is pretty forgettable compared to About That Life."
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Black Tongue - Born Hanged/Falsifier redux

Delusions of Grandeur - Reclamation 

Rex - Possession EP

Martyr Defiled - No Hope, No Mortality 

The Last 10 Seconds of Life - INVIVO[EXVIVO] 

Emmure - Eternal Enemies "
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","rings of saturn, shadow of intent, dawning of the inferno, aversions crown, beacons, slaughter to prevail, cerebus, dysphoria, vulvodynia, Aeons of corruption. 
ALL great stuff.


You really couldnt have chosen a WORST year to fall behind in deathcore lol "
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","I got RoS, but the rest I've missed. Thanks. 

Hah yeah, I chose the best (or worst depending on how you look at it) year to get into deathcore. "
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","yeah,so many albums this year :D "
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","And so many great ones too. The year has been pretty meh for metalcore, but most of the deathcore I've heard this year has been golden. "
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Serpents and Reaping Asmodeia, and Deep in Hate were pretty good surprises.  The Room Colored Charlatan is some good stuff too."
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Technically it came out at the very end of last year, but check out Lorna Shore's EP called Maleficium

its been my favorite thing to listen to all year

the offbeat breakdowns are fucking awesome"
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Martyr Defiled - No Hope No Morality, Aversions Crown - Tyrant and Black Tongue - Born Hanged "
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Betraying the Martyrs - Phantom is worth a listen.  Some might say it sounds over-produced.  Idk.  The lows are still solid so it's at least worth a listen."
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Love this album!"
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","&gt; Some might say it sounds over-produced

I don't mind slick production. Aren't Betraying the Martyrs one of the few deathcore groups that has cleans? "
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Yeah they use a fair amount of cleans on this album too.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KebRqQMk6Q) is the album, I should've linked it in the original comment.  They still go pretty hard and the cleans are usually pretty well done."
"Kind of behind on deathcore this year, what am I missing?","Cleans are definitely a positive for me, as long as they're done well. "
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Share below!
EDIT: that should be ""about"" a band. Fuck you,distracted typing."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","As soon as I heard You Only Live Once I knew I wasn't a Suicide Silence fan anymore. 

"
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Yup, this 100%. LOVED their first two records, but TBC and the new one both do nothing for me."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","I'm so stoked you weren't down voted to hell for that.  Their first raw deathcore sound was so influential.  I really think they didn't have the talent to branch out that early. "
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","I hated Born of Osiris until Follow the Signs came out."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Infant Annihilator An Exhalation of Disease. The rowdy thrashy two step part in that song really helped me see a different side of their music in the rest of their songs. But that part is my favorite on the album, the part is just so filthy."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","There are so many wicked hardcore beats and brutal slams throughout the album that always go unnoticed the first time around. It wasn't until I started listening to a lot of slam death that I really learned to appreciate how goddamn groovy IA can be."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","It's really true. I remember when I first listened to it, all I heard was blast beats (which is not a bad thing), but I always need that slam groove to really annoy people on my train ride home heh"
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Mine too!"
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","I really wasn't big on Rings of Saturn until they released the first single from the new album. The kinda spacey-sweeping riff midway through the song completely captivated me, and now Lugal Ki En is easily in my top 5 of 2014."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Yeah I mean Dingir isn't bad but it doesnt have the same flow that Lugal Ki En has."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","They just perfected their formula I think. Dingir is interesting and memorable, but not as captivating nor brutal."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Whitechapel's The Somatic Defilement made me love the band. I had only heard I, Dementia and while I love it now, it didn't have the power I was after at the time but The Somatic Defilement delivered for sure. There are a few other bands that this has happened to, including Architects with Borrowed Time, Sick of it All with Road Less Traveled and Aborted with The Extirpation Agenda."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Dude it should be a crime to be introduced to anything but The Somatic Defilement as your first taste of Whitechapel. It's easily one of the most influential albums on the deathcore subgenre. "
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","I hated Attilla with a passion until I heard Payback, ever since I pretty much dig everything they ever put out."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Bro,exactly for me too!"
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","The first song I heard by Bring Me The Horizon after Pray for Plagues... that album had its moments, I really liked Oli Sykes' scream, but they are so fucking terrible now. I almost crashed my car when I first heard ""Sleepwalking"" on the radio recently

edit - whoops the album I'm talking about is called Count Your Blessings I just realized."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","I like everything Bring Me The Horizon has put out ^^^^^^^even ^^^^^^^Drown"
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","I just can't bring myself to like Drown. It's too boring."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","It lacks their character I get that, but it's a enjoyable for me for a few listens."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","its pop music"
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","I honestly grew to like their newer stuff even better even though I disliked it a lot at first."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Right? It's one of the few softer bands that I like now..."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Pray for plagues is definitely one of my favorite albums but the new stuff is growing on me. I think I probably like it because it's like listening to a totally different band (which is kinda sad cause old bring me was fantastic) so usually it just comes down to what I'm in the mood for."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Yeah their new stuff isn't unlistenable, it's actually a good deal better than a lot of modern rock you'll hear on the radio these days, it's just disappointing to me that they totally abandoned being brutal."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","I like all of their albums for very different reasons. There is a hell has to be my favorite out of all of them though. Why do you dismiss their new stuff as shit? It's a completely different style of music and can't really be compared to their older music."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","I mean you're free to like their new stuff. I just like deathcore but hate most metalcore."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Each to their own I guess. I really like their new stuff though, even though I dislike a lot of metalcore too, I couldn't sit through an Of Mice &amp; Men album."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","but Sleepwalking is the best song they've ever put out."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","So I like screamed vocals, and I like clean vocals, but I'm really not a fan of the middle ground - like an Emmure talking to screaming sort of thing, or the half-scream half-sing going on for most of Sleepwalking. There was little enough of it on Pray for Plagues that I liked it, sadly for me that was the direction BTMH chose to pursue."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Fair enough, while I do like Count Your Blessings a lot, Sempiternal is far and away my favorite of their albums."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Don't Ask Don't Tell from Chelsea Grin. Worst song they ever made, after that I didn't really listen to them anymore."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Yeah man, they aren't doing it for me any more. Desolation of Eden was great, My Damnation got boring real fast for me and then the Evolve EP was just.....not good"
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Being a big metalcore fan I enjoyed Evolve just because it seemed a little more melodic, but Desolation of Eden is by far my favorite Chelsea Grin album. Didn't think Ashes to Ashes was that great but it has its gems imo."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","IMO My Damnation is amazing, DoE and EP were also amazing. I don't dig the rest of their music honestly..."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Cease to Exist by Suicide Silence. I mean obviously they have a new singer but I'm honestly not a fan of his vocals. Liked SS a lot before but not looking forward to any new albums now."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","I just can't get behind Eddie's lyrics. His vocals are good, but the writing has been pretty lackluster."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","It's so crazy too because so much of the stuff Eddie wrote with ASP especially in their early years fit so well."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","I agree. The new guys vocals just don't do it for me :("
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","This. So much this."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","The whole album of Dingir"
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Emmure, first I thought they were OK chuggy deathcore, good if you were in the mood for it but MDMA showed me a more feelsy side, that I wish they played up more."
"Songs that changed your opinion on a band?","Hypocrisy by Sworn In. I *really* liked *Catharsis* and *Start/End* (which is still my all-time favorite beatdown hardcore EP), but when they released Hypocrisy as the first single from The Death Card, I knew I was going to hate the album (and even after *trying* to like it, I still fucking hate it)."
"Looking for Graphic Designers","My band [The Levitated](https://www.facebook.com/thelevitated) is looking for a Graphic Designer to make us a new band logo. We are willing to pay a fair amount for it. We'd just want to see some examples of your past work before making a commitment. Please comment if you know of anyone that could help us out. Or PM me about ideas, rates, ect..."
"Looking for Graphic Designers","I really hope you guys find someone suitable, cause your song that I just heard is fucking awesome. Although I wouldn't really classify it as deathcore, to be honest. While the guitar tones and percussion definitely speak to that of early-Despised Icon/newer-Whitchapel, the grooves and vocals are more reminiscient of metalcore, along the lines of Sworn In, Architects, Wolves, and Seditionist. Try cross-posting to /r/metalcore just in case, because they'll dig this shit and you might find what you're looking for there.

But deathcore fans, check this shit out. It rips, it grooves, and the vocals seem to have a really nice emotional emphasis to them. The first couple lines of Progress/Process are just absolutely captivating. Hope to see some more releases from you guys soon, and no matter what style it'll follow, you'd better be posting it here so I can find it."
"Looking for Graphic Designers","Wow, thanks man. this means a lot that you even gave us a listen. thanks for the feedback. I already made a post to r/metalcore at the same time as this one. I just thought there might be some people here that could help us with designs. "
"Looking for Graphic Designers","There ought to be. People have hooked up artists with bands on this sub before, and I guarantee as soon as someone takes the time out to listen to your stuff, they'll be pushing it just the same as I am. Feel free to post your song itself on the sub as well."
"Looking for Graphic Designers","Architects are hardcore son"
"Looking for Graphic Designers","I gave you a listen and it's awesome. You really remind me of Northlane sometimes. I can't help you much with graphic design, but depending on what you need I could try to do something. Just out of boredom. I can promise you that it won't turn out good, but at least you get something to choose from."
"Looking for Graphic Designers","Northlane was exactly the comparison I was looking for. It's like a heavier, more ""raw"" take on Northlane's prog-metal/core sound, especially as the vocals are so expressionate just like Adrian's were and Marcus' are now. Good catch."

I feel the vocals can't compete with the guitar tuning, unfortunately, BUT everyone loves Phil and I'm no exception. He pulled this song together. I've seen WC live, caught a drumstick, and got Phil to sign it because I'm kind of a giant fan boy. I honestly wish he would do more with a djenty sound versus his normal music.

This is my band Bearhouse. This is a VERY rough demo I made to show the rest of my band the new song I wrote. Its not nearly finished, but so far I have gotten only good feedback. I would like an honest opinion. I did everything on this track. I know the quality is shit, so please ignore that.

"I'll listen to your favorite deathcore song if I haven't heard the band before.","Fucking solid. Loved all your vocal parts. Guitar isn't very good at all tbh (sorry) and the drums are average.

Keep working on this and I'll try keep up with you!"
"I'll listen to your favorite deathcore song if I haven't heard the band before.","Thanks man! 
To be honest, I slapped the guitar on pretty fast. I didn't really write it ahead of time, but rather winged it to go with the vocals. I went for simple, and went a little too simple haha. I'll make sure I'm on that soon"
"I'll listen to your favorite deathcore song if I haven't heard the band before.","Your vocals are great, but I feel the guitar work and all the instruments in genral were not as good, and the transition beetween the instruments and your vocals were difficult to hear.. I want the vocals to come bashing in! Just in my opinion.. But still, great work by you and your band! Keep it up!"

"Has anyone been to the Suicide/Dahlia tour?","I went to the stop in Detroit. It was sick. Then again, Black Dahlia Murder always seems to be epic around here, being their hometown and all. If you havnt seen them since Mitch passed, I will say you will probably be pleasantly surprised. The new vocalist for S.S. did a kick ass job. Also, if you do bad at the wall of death he'll make you do a second one."

"Has anyone been to the Suicide/Dahlia tour?","I went in Cleveland. Every band fucking ruled, definitely go to it if possible. Dahlia was obviously the best because they're god-tier amazingly perfect, but every single band was good. I'd say Alex's vocals surprised me the most; I was expecting mediocrity but he sounded fantastic. "
"Has anyone been to the Suicide/Dahlia tour?","I went to the Boston one. Like everyone is saying every band was amazing. "
"Has anyone been to the Suicide/Dahlia tour?","Get there early and watch Alterbeast. Every show I've seen them play is always intense top notch musicianship. "

You've got better grit and tone than 50% of the established vocalists out there, it's just technique, power, and control that you lack, and those are the 3 things that make or break vocals.

Practice *those* things. Don't just sit around, barking and squealing like you're trying to be brutal. Focus your technique, focus your power, *exercise* your breath control. Don't even *think* about ""covering"" a song until you find your sound, and deliver at least *some* evidence of technique, power, and control. And for fuck's sake, don't ever ""cover"" BMTH.

"Ingested - Beginners Guide (2006 - 2015)","**Ingested Beginners Guide**

After the recent release of Archetect of Extinction, and the awesome work of /u/dspang, I wanted to create a beginners guide for Ingetsted. I hope you enjoy it, and I hope we can have some good discussions around it. At a high level, if you like Acrania, Suicide Silence (the cleansing), Vulvodynia, AngelMaker - this is your jams right here. 

**Holy Butchery - 2006**

The album opens with that nice crunchy, classic myspace deathcore sound. The quality of the sound reminiscences Suicide Silence’s self-titled EP. It gives the feels of that classic 2006 myspace feel when, if you are like me, you were in high school, and it’s nostalgic as shit. On The Holy Butchery, the vocals transition from lows, to highs with thick, gurgling slam vocals sprinkled throughout. Though the recording quality isn’t the stuff we hear now in 2015, you can definitely hear the Ingested sound. The formula is still there — fast blast beats, tremolo picking out the ass, rivers of triplets, and some really solid, thick, heavy breakdowns. What is missing from this album that you’ll hear in later Ingested albums is the maturity of blending death metal, slam, and deathcore. This is very much a deathcore/slam/brutally focused album. 

My favorite parts are the unrelenting slam breakdowns and stomps they go into. It feels so classic. A lot of them are generic and you can feel them coming; however, they are still creative in their use of these elements considering how other bands were using them at this time. The ending track Joined by Digestion gives a good taste of what is to be expected next from Ingested release. 

Notable mentions: Erotic Depravity, Copromesis, Joined by Digestion

**Surpassing the Boundries of Human Suffering - 2009**

Fastforward 3 years and Ingested released their first full length. It begins with a tremolo picking build up dropping into the same heaviness we loved on their first effort. However this time, the recording quality is much better. Quality reminds me of Signal the Firing Squad’s album Abnegate. The sound from Holy Butchery has evolved quite a bit introducing new elements into how they form their chords. There is no loss in heaviness, but there is a focus on using more than just the top two strings to make a chord. This creates a sound scape not present in the first album. They include 3 songs from their EP re-done on the album, and they sound even better.

Skinned and Fucked is a great example for where Ingested was heading at this time. You can clearly hear infant elements of Architect of Intinction in this album. The speed and cadence of their sound is really established for what later Ingested albums would feel like. 

One of my favorite parts of Ingested are their stomp riffs. Most of the time, Ingested puts a nasty little dark beat to them. This is the first album where that is present. There is a clear beat and cadence to each stomp, making me feel like I’m in a dark murderous march hellscape.

The vocals do change a bit on this album. They lose some of the slam qualities present in the first album (this isn’t a bad thing as the variety really does a lot to make the album more interesting). They also double up the vocals now as well for the first time mixing high + lows at the same time. 

Notable mentions: Skinned and Fucked, Intercranial Semen Injection, Stillborn, Condemned to Rape

**The Surreption - 2011**

This is the only Ingested album to date that starts off with a cut scene. It’s from the movie The Rite: ""Not believing in the devil won't protect you from him.” Good ol’ Anthony Hopkins. The first track shows a new side of Ingested. The whole album feels like an experiment in some ways. This is the first time we hear clean shouty hardcore vocals on an album. The feel of the album is more structured and feels more straight forward as opposed to Surpassing the Boundries of Human Suffering. 

They still have the Ingested sounds, but it almost has a military timing to it - and I really like it on this album. It is a great mix between old school deathcore and new school deathcore. They add in this ambient hymns in the background / synth giving it that mystical value not present in the first two albums. However, they still have fast paced parts, stomps, and over the top breakdowns. The song, Omega, the last song on the album is Ingested’s first instrumental track on one of their CDs. 

The vocals have improved a lot; they are clearer, the highs are higher and on point throughout. A lot of this is also due to the overall rise in production quality on the album as well. More structure is not a bad thing for Ingested. Their song structure feels intricate. Each riff feels placed thoughtfully to stay in time with the rest of the song/album based on a very specific theme.

There is a clear focus on developing riffs and lead ins that is absent (ok, they’re there just not as well thought out) from the first two albums. A lot more pausing in time to add emphasis to different elements, not just breakdowns, we’re talking every element. ""Would this sound cool if we fucked with the timing on it?” This is the question I feel they asked on every track. 

This may have been where their sound matured, but in it, they lost the raw anger from the previous two cds for me. They also begin to experiment with other kinds of guitar i.e. clean guitar riffs for emphasis. This albums feels like a time to try a lot of new things out. They have their first vocal only intro on the 3rd track and the the album’s hardcore shouting vocals are also new for them. Overall the tone of the album is more deathcore/hardcore leaving out some of the deathy elements. 

Notable mentions: Crowning the Abomination, Deline, Disgusting Revelation, Manifesting Obscenity, Alpha / Omegan (together, always together). 

**Revered By No One, Feared By All EP - 2013**

This is a perfect name for this album because this EP goes hard from start to finish. There is no break for your face melting between tracks. No slow build ups to the next song. No hardcore vocals. Just fast, hard, viscous shit. This is the realization of the Ingested sound we hear in Architect of Extinction  The vocals are there in the monstrous doubled slam lows on those insane highs. The guitar tone is there and huge with a lot of creativity in transitions and attention to the mood an accent note on any chord makes. 

They embraced more chordy, deathy riffs where appropriate which really added a new dimension onto these guys I don’t feel was fully explored until this EP. 

The album starts off with some sweet palm mute, chord driven breakdowns. There is a lot more complexity in the sound than just a straight open note breakdowns. And did I mention there are filthy stomps through out this album. They really played to the death metal and slam elements that were always in their music, but now they seem to know the recipe to get the sound they want. The unique piece to this album to me is the mathy feel it can have at times. I would say that is the special piece of this album you may not get from Architect of Extinction which makes this a standout effort. 

First two songs give a taste of the old, last two songs really, really give a taste of the new (imo). Uncrowned sounds like it could be off of Architect of Extinction. 

Notable mentions: Titanonmachy, Uncrowned 

**Architect of Extinction - 2015**

I have not listened to a new release this much straight since Acrania’s Totalitarian Dystopia or since I first found And Hell Followed With's Proprioception. So, bear in mind I am approaching it in that way before you read this… this album kicks the devil in the nuts and then sits on his thrown. This will be my album of the year. 

The first track, Divine Right of Kings, sets the tone for what to expect on the whole album. The pause before the epic first breakdown and then the lows start. The vocals are layered in a way that sounds awesome reminding me a bit of Lorelei or Ovid’s Withering mixed with Acrania + Vulvodynia throughout the whole album. The guitars sound like a beefy machine gun being fired. 

What really does it for me on this album is the mood. There is a consistent mood throughout the whole album. It’s dark and really fits the team of the album which feels very dystopian. They evoke this emotion in every part of the album. The Elliot Rodgers quote - “Humanity is a disgusting, wretched, depraved species” (there’s more, but too lazy to type all out) really sets this album into another state of erie. This is a pretty recent event, and in the context of what he did, leading into The Heir To Mankind’s Atrocities it feels pretty fitting. 

They really drive home the mood with the dark, deathy chords they use mixed with their timing. It’s like a high speed train crash in perfect unison and under the control of someone. Though it may sound chaotic, there is always a lower beat / feel that is there. My favorite part of this album are the triplet rolled stomps. The best of these, for me, is in Extinction Event (“I AM THE ARCHITECT OF EXTINCTION”). The cadence of this song is incredible. It just rolls over and over just bashing in your skull. Favorite song on the album - it’s heavy as Roseanne too. 

If you are going to listen to any album of this list. It’s this one. 

Notable mentions: THE WHOLE ALBUM.

I know with this kind of music it may seem like you have to play it like that, but don't.

"Consumption - Seven Instruments [OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO]",""
"Consumption - Seven Instruments [OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO]","It's like he doesn't like children or something...

In all seriousness, this is pretty bad. The instruments are boring and the lyrics are cringey at best.

Production is decent though. So, there's that, at least."
"Consumption - Seven Instruments [OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO]","""Basically this album is a far more demented version of the Charles Manson story. It follows the downfall of two best friends (Adam and Anna) who have extreme home-life issues. The two decide to follow closely behind a seemingly harmless role-model named Benjamin. Through the use of drugs and extreme persuasion, he is able to manipulate the pair, along with a few other kids, into committing malicious and hateful deeds. From cultic ritual to kidnapping, torture to decapitation, it becomes blatantly clear that these kids are willing to do anything to please their leader. I hope you enjoy experiencing this story as much as I enjoyed crafting it. This is The Divine Ruination."" - Gage Earls (vocals) of Consumption

The drums are programmed and the guitar, bass and vocals are recorded in their room. Jordan Becker (mixed it, wrote instruments, programmed the drums &amp; he's the Guitarist/Bassist) has only played for a few months :-) Sorry you couldn't dig it though!"
"Consumption - Seven Instruments [OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO]","I mean, that's great and all. But that doesn't make it any more appealing. But, hey. That's an opinion, right?"

4) 3 band nominations per person limit.

The artist that wins will have a CSS theme dedicated to them for the month. Start nominating and voting on who you want to see make it to the final round!

"Why Deathcore is the best music","I listened to a lot of different music. It started as a teen in the late 90's with nu-metal shit like Disturbed and Godsmack. Then came hardcore. I was into everything from Bleeding Through and Terror to Martyr A.D. and Black My Heart. After many years (01-08) of hardcore I ended up listening to opera shit like Nightwish and Epica and then trailed off into dubstep and forgot about metal. Then my new best friend showed me Deathcore, and bands like Rings of Saturn, Hail to the King, Carnifex and Whitechapel have given me a new focus on good music.

Anyway, long live deathcore, sorry for the drunken rant, raise a pint and toast to your favorite FUCKING BRUTAL band!

EDIT: What's your favorite band and why is Deathcore the best, motherfuckers?"
"Why Deathcore is the best music","Deathcore is best because it is the only extreme metal subgenre that successfully blends with raw emotion and melody with pure brutality.

Favorites: Thy Art Is Murder, Shadow Of The Colossus,Conducting From The Grave, Ingested, and Xehanort"
"Why Deathcore is the best music","&gt; That successfully blends with raw emotion and melody with pure brutality.

Absolutely Poetic."
"Why Deathcore is the best music","Thy Art Is Murder, Whitechapel, Rings of Saturn, King Conquer, Taylor Swift, Within The Ruins, Older Suicide Silence, Oceano, "
"Why Deathcore is the best music","Ya sometimes after so much deathcore Taylor Swift usually mellows me out."
"Why Deathcore is the best music","Well I do have Carnifex tattooed across my calf..."
"Why Deathcore is the best music","What if they break up?"
"Why Deathcore is the best music","It aint about the band its about their music, they did break up after I got the tattoo and I was heartbroken but it didn't diminish the tattoo for me. The tattoo also reminds me of a time in my life when Carnifex was the only comfort I had, Scott's lyrics really resonated with me. It reminds me that I never want to feel that way again and it's a badge of honor that i made it out of there in one piece "
"Why Deathcore is the best music","I see. Sounds like a very positive tattoo!"
"Why Deathcore is the best music","It is! It was my first and is still my favorite :)"
"Why Deathcore is the best music","Is it painful?"
"Why Deathcore is the best music","Yes of course it hurt "
"Why Deathcore is the best music","When people ask ""How do you listen to that shit?!"" I simply explain them the power of music, it's relative to the user. I can listen the multiple deathcore bands and determine ones that I THINK are worth listening to and ones that aren't and distinguish differnts styles of influences the bands have. All in the mean time and non-deathcore listener would just say "" But they all just sound the same?"" To which I retort ""I think all EDM and country music sounds the same, simply because I don't give them the time of day to listen to those genres"" It's all about relativity and what makes you happy, and deathcore makes me happy.

Favorites: Thy Art Is Murder, Black Tongue, Veil of Maya, Rings of Saturn

"Why Deathcore is the best music","Obviously Rings of Saturn sounds like a copy of Thy Art Is Murder. And Whitechapel is literally just the same band as Ingested."

If you got into deathcore after 08 then you probably missed these great bands, I recommend you to check them out "
"Why Deathcore is the best music","I really feel sad for all the people who weren't around for the 06-09 deathcore phase. There was so much sick shit. There silk is, but there's just so much nostalgia from those few years."
"Why Deathcore is the best music","I think early 2000s metalcore is even better than mid 2000s deathcore, people were wearing really tight shirts and bootcut girl jeans and converse or new balance shoes (the tr00 hxc kids usually wore NBs lol) "
"Why Deathcore is the best music","FUCKIN ELYSIA! I saw them on one of their last tours before they broke up! They played at a tiny record store like 40 minutes from my house with a bunch of local bands, and another touring band whose name I forgot. It was fucking awesome."
"Why Deathcore is the best music","Ovid's Withering, AngelMaker, Lorelei, Shadow Of The Colossus, Obliterationist, and A Night In Texas are the future of deathcore imo."
"Why Deathcore is the best music","Im not really going to try to argue that deathcore is the best music, because that's 100% subjective

It is, however, the best music for me

I love the deathcore style breakdowns more than any other genre. Fused death metal, you also get the evilness, the blast beats, the tremolo picking, etc that I love. Plus deathcore brings the screams that death metal doesn't have.

Favorite bands currently: Lorna Shore, Aversions Crown, Thy Art Is Murder, Rings of Saturn "
"Why Deathcore is the best music","If you haven't yet, try listening to Born Of Osiris. That's what I recommend to everyone who is sort of new to the deathcore and metalcore scene. After all these years they still drop my jaw And raise the hairs on the back of my neck. "

"Why Deathcore is the best music","Humanity's Last Breath's last album is a one-man band record. Can't wait for Buster Odeholm to release the new tracks. He's also Vildhjatra's new drummer. "

"Why Deathcore is the best music","&gt;What's your favorite band and why is Deathcore the best, motherfuckers?

Carnifex. They're basically Slaughter of the Soul 2: This Time It's Deathcore. "
"Why Deathcore is the best music","Deathcore is not the best. Don't get me wrong, I love some occasional deathcore. Whitechapel is one of my favorite extreme metal bands. It's just that a lot of deathcore is tasteless and predictable. It doesn't matter how ""brutal"" you are if your music is boring. Textbook case of this is Emmure. Heavy chunky guitar riffs and pounding drums, but it' so predictable I could tell what they were going to do 10 seconds before I even heard the rest of the song. Listen to some bands like Opeth and Gojira. They make a large amount of Deathcore bands look like children that just picked up some instruments in guitar center. There are so many more talented and technically beautiful so much raw power and emotion like Dying fetus. With so many thriving subgenres, it's so unfair to not even give them a try and to just give the assumption that deathcore is superior.

TL;DR I like deathcore, but it is far form the best music."
"Why Deathcore is the best music","Deathcore is awesome because sometimes you just want to get hit in the ears by a train of pure brutality.

Scar Symmetry has to be one of my favorites, but it's debatable if that's deathcore. Acacia Strain is really good too. All Shall Perish and the new Suicide Silence (same vocals) are also brutal as fuck and amazing."
"Why Deathcore is the best music","Scar symmetry is melodic death metal, with some influences of groove metal."
"Why Deathcore is the best music","Technically it's Progressive Power Melodic Death Metal. *adjusts glasses*

But I threw it in there because it has some of the same qualities that I like in deathcore :P"
"Why Deathcore is the best music","Nah, this band is ""Progressive Power Melodic Death Metal"": [Crimson Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snI-FiyM7Dg)."
"Why Deathcore is the best music","So is Scar Symmetry. I got it directly from their [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar_Symmetry). Can't they both be?"

"Any bands like Whitechapel?","Title"
"Any bands like Whitechapel?","Depends what era of Whitechapel you're into.

The Somatic Defilement (10/10 best era) is pretty much as ""deathcore"" as it gets. Basically just shovelling ""core"" influences into a modernized death metal sound to get that crushing effect. Try bands like Separatist, Aversions Crown, AngelMaker, Strychnia, A Night In Texas, Xehanort, Hester Prynne, and (obviously) Thy Art Is Murder to get a feel for what basically became of that.

After that, they refined it. Made it a little boring, IMO, but none can deny their subsequent albums were masterpeices in their own right, and PhillyBo cemented his place as one of the best deathcore vocalists of all time. For this era, try stuff that is noticeably influenced by Whitechapel in general: (early) Chelsea Grin, The Dialectic, Oceano, Chamber Of Malice, Acrania, Ingested, Infant Annihilator, Obliterationist, Lorna Shore, and Rings Of Saturn (for the groove).

Finally, their new stuff. I like it, although it seems polarizing amongst deathcore fans. It's a little proggy but stays true to the nature of the beast, so to speak. Check out bands like Ovid's Withering, Shadow Of The Colossus, Humanity's Last Breath, Improvidence, and I, Valiance. None of them really seem reminiscient of Whitechapel's influence at first listen, but pay close attention to the grooves, dynamic shifts, and incorporation of progressive elements. You'll hear it."
"Any bands like Whitechapel?","Thank you for a real answer. I love Somatic Defilement and I agree that that is their best album. I would love their new album if more of their songs sounded like Fall of the Hypocrites. I will definitely check out those bands!  "
"Any bands like Whitechapel?","New Whitechapel really seems to suffer from taking one too many listens to really get into it. It's solid stuff, but that first spin through is so awkward because it's such a departure from their previous stuff."
"Any bands like Whitechapel?","Check out the band Overthrower- The free world."

"Veil Of Maya - We Bow In Its Aura","Excellent track. IMO, their later stuff doesn't even touch Common Man's Collapse.

I don't even think meshuggah originated the 8 stringers, some classical players from back in the day wanted to be able to play bass notes while playing the higher register, kinda what we're doing. I literally need every string on my guitar to play all the songs. And our bassist is in Eb standard lol. Hope I could shine a little light on that!

"AVERSIONS CROWN's 'Tyrant' Full-Album Stream","**AOTY?!**

Been anxiously awaiting this release all year, I think it's definitely in the conversation for Album Of The Year after first listen. I don't think there are any other huge releases coming up for the rest of 2014 so we can start to reflect.

Based on popularity in this sub I'd say the winner has to be between Aversion's Crown, Rings Of Saturn, and Acrania.

In my opinion the decision is a lot tougher as I really liked Sever The King, Seditionist, Boris The Blade, I Declare War, Black Tongue, and Depths Of Hatred's releases this year too.

What are your top 3 from 2014? And if there are still upcoming releases I'm forgetting please remind me. "
"AVERSIONS CROWN's 'Tyrant' Full-Album Stream","As far as straight up deathcore is concerned I would say that Rings of Saturn has definitely got the album of the year for me. 

With that said, and although not really deathcore, Job for a cowboy's newest album destroys everything that has been released this year (in the death metal category). Some of the best prog death I've ever heard. "
"AVERSIONS CROWN's 'Tyrant' Full-Album Stream","JFAC's album is sick indeed but there are plenty of death metal albums released this year that would compete with it. Check out both Origin's and Fallujah's full lengths that came out this year."
"AVERSIONS CROWN's 'Tyrant' Full-Album Stream","I haven't heard origins album but I've listened to fallujahs several times. I was a huge fan of their first album and EP, and when I heard the first single for their newest album it blew me away, but the whole album wasn't as consistently good for me. I think the ambiance was a little too high in the mix but eh different strokes for different folks lol"

"Looking for some TRACK suggestions based off of these ones...","So I stopped listening to metal like 2 years ago. But my lifelong best friend recently passed away and I wanted to get back into it and remember the old days. He introduced me to BMTH and Slipknot in high school, and was himself a vocalist/guitarist/drummer/everything (check out his band Brandywine).

Anyways, I made a playlist of my favorite songs, and was wondering if you guys had suggestions of TRACKS that sound similar. I'm looking for specific songs, not just band names. 

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNoolewg3H8QXezt59p6gWdwSrZ9eCm_6

- No clean vocals
- No group/gang vocals
- No pig squeals
- No electronic or ambient parts
- Brutal, heavy, makes you want to kill someone
- High energy, something you could work out to
- No emotional/slow/sad parts
- Don't care much about technical skill, I just like the brutal sound

And to help you further understand my taste, here's some songs that I don't like, and I tell you why I don't.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BUD0hzxkwk - Don't like the guy's voice, similar to the guy's in Whitechapel which I don't like. Doesn't sound angry/brutal/vicious enough.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2d-o86qJH8 - Don't like the voice. Sounds pig squealy and similar to above.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwfp3pWndGE - This is pretty much perfect besides the clean vocals. His clean vocals just ruin it. The screams he does are pretty damn good though.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UESpQMpUgHU - Voice sounds off, kind of pig squeally. And the band can't get a good melody going. The drums are hitting too fast, it seems like a musical mess.
"
"Looking for some TRACK suggestions based off of these ones...","Everything ever made by The Acacia Strain and Black Tongue. "
"Looking for some TRACK suggestions based off of these ones...","are you kidding me he just said he doesn't like the vocalist of the acacia strain"
"Looking for some TRACK suggestions based off of these ones...","Ahh. Didn't read all of it. Oh well. "
"Looking for some TRACK suggestions based off of these ones...","sounds like you want downtempo/beatdown deathcore. i love that shit so i got you dude. i threw in some other stuff i thought you might like too.

"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","Any one here going to this show? Chelsea grin, black tongue, carnifex, and some others. It's my first real show and I was wondering what to expect"
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","Oh Carnifex. Expect to bang your head and have a good time.. But you probably need to watch our for hardcore dancing idiots, unfortunately."
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","My thoughts exactly. I'm going with my SO and my friend and would rather not have any of us hit. The only concert I have been too, within the ruins, I saw two girls punched in the face by those guys. Would rather that not happen. 

Edit: forgot to mention carnifex is pretty much what got me into deathcore, he'll chose me was and is an amazing song. Do you have any idea what their current line up may be?"
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","Do not stand on the edge of the pit. Keep your SO in arms length. Enough for you to put a fist out if needed so that person hits your fist before your SO. Also, if shit starts getting crazy around you, push her behind you where the crazy is not happening and start moshing like a mad man. This will cause everyone around you to stop and give you space, thus saving your SO and yourself. But main rule, if you don't want to get bumped or hit, stay away from the edge of the pit. "
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","I feel like I've gotten hurt so many more times on the edge of the pit rather than actually being in the pit."
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","That's reassuring   :\"
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","Have faith, I think he means physically standing on the edge where you are essentially the human shield between the pit and the people standing on the edge. This is probably the worst place to stand at any given time especially if kids are crowd bashing / really getting into that circle pit. You'll be good have faith. 
"
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","Haha thanks, I'm not really worried about myself though. I can take pain, just rather not have my SO get clocked. But yeah we'lol definitely stay a little ways away from the pit"
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","Just keep her behind you. Or in front of you if you plan on being close to the stage."
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","There's tons of places to stand at a show. Stand at the back. "
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","Thanks for the advice, I'm definitely gonna mosh a bit but that's not her scene. Thankfully my friend will be there so we can take turns in the pit"
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","They play hatred and slaughter, hell chose me, slit wrist savior towards the end, a lot of the new album. They are so great live. "
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","Thanks man! I'm getting so psyched up waiting for this. I can't wait to hear these guys! "
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","Exact same way I got into it! Hell chose me is still my favorite song \m/"
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","Worcester native here. If you end up on the floor where the pit is, be careful. Worcester goes hard. I'll be there, it will be an absolute banger of a show!"
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","Wooh! How hard we talking? Like broken bones or bloody noses? My brother had his jaw broken at an emmure concert (4+ years ago) and I'd rather avoid shit like that "
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","People get thrown out for fighting a lot. It depends on the crowd. Just be aware of what is happening around you!"
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","The Palladium has an area right above the floor that's great for shows when you don't want to be in the pit. You're still close enough to the stage to see eveything, but no worrying about some dude's elbow clocking you in the face. It's my go-to for shows there."
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","Sweet thanks for the advice! That's probably where we'll be then. Do they have a bar there or do I have to pre-game?"
"Chelsea grin at the palladium (Worcester)","There's a bar a little ways behind that. But you'd definitely need someone to hold your spot, or else somebody will take it as soon as you move."

[Calmed by the Tides of Rain - Shores](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5ZSwaoetos) - Such a great Russian band(I don't know what it is about Russia but they do deathcore and slam death so well.)  This is one of my absolute favorites in this small microcosm of deathcore.  
[Continent - Decaying Days](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxzFSjxSTcU) - Here's a newer one that I've gotten into.  Really dark and doomey sounding.  It plods and seeths with absolute hatred.  
[Face Your Maker - Tyranny](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmz7aLrqLZ8) - Another fantastic band here.  This song starts at a more mid-tempo but slows the fuck down over the course of the song.  Awesomeness."

"The Acacia Strain - Holy Walls of the Vatican","I agree with you. Not every band we discover becomes our favorite lol. "
"The Acacia Strain - Holy Walls of the Vatican","Check out some of their older stuff before Wormwood. For me, an avid listener since their first album, Wormwood was not that enjoyable - it was repetitive and unoriginal. 

Their first album, ...And Life Is Very Long, wasn't their best by far, but ""The Widowmaker"" and ""Cable Ready Techno Slut"" deserve a listen.

Their next album, 3750, is better; I enjoy every song off that album.

Moving forward again, they released my absolute favorite album of theirs, The Dead Walk. Every song is incredible and original.

Continent is next and aside from the obvious changes in production value as they had become more popular and hence had a larger production budget, the album is still great.

After this, they released their Most Heard Unheard EP, off of which I enjoyed ""Terminator"" and ""Stat Puft.""

Then came Wormwood, which I wasn't too much of a fan of, and then Death Is Only Mortal, off of which I only liked Brain Death and was extremely disappointed.

They also covered ""War Pigs"" by Black Sabbath on the Resistance soundtrack.

All in all, for me, it goes like this: The Dead Walk &gt; 3750 &gt; Continent &gt; Most Heard Unheard EP &gt; ...And Life Is Very Long &gt; Wormwood &gt; Death Is Only Mortal.

Hope this helps you find some music from this band that you can enjoy!"
"The Acacia Strain - Holy Walls of the Vatican","I completely agree with you dude, except for me it would be The Dead Walk &gt; 3750 &gt; Continent &gt; Death Is The Only Mortal &gt; ...And Life Is Very Long &gt; Most Heard Unheard EP &gt; Wormwood.

Wormwood just wasn't that great to me, as soon as they switch to 8 strings it turned me off.  The songs on DITOM seemed like DL knew how to write better songs with an 8 string though so that was cool."

Yes there's Danza and Rings of Saturn, but I find them more of mathcore with breakdowns.  I highly recommend listening to Dysphorias previous 2 albums, but do note that the first album needs to be listened to from beginning to end to comprehend it: the first 3 tracks are all just chugging, while the last tracks are straight up mathcore.  It's not until the 2nd album that the 2 genres are pretty much fused together.  Can't wait to see what they do in the future."

Not the most innovative or original album, but the jams are just that good. Martyr Defiled keep their formula: heavy, with some hardcore here and there, memorable and with simple songstructures most of the time. There's a reason why the chorus from 616 was stuck in my head all year, these guys just know how to write good deathcore songs."

Well for one thing Dan Watson is at the helm of this five piece that also includes highly skilled guitarists and surprisingly the drummer of famous non deathcore band Lacuna Coil. Now Watsons vocals just flow perfectly with the fantastic drums and the unique guitar to provide an atmospheric journey of sound. This EP may only be 16 minutes long but it is one of the finest 16 minutes in deathcore. The Lyrics give an otherworldly vibe and make you feel like you are being abducted by aliens and being enlightened to all the dark secrets in this world. This EP is a masterpiece and deserves to be AOTY"

"Album Of The Year Thread - 2014","Ashes To Ashes – Chelsea Grin

For me it's the best Chelsea Grin album so far and one of the best deathcore albums ever released. It's heavy, technical, innovative and very well recorded. There's a great variety of songs and those 3 guitars are put together in such a elegant way. Plus it has got an immense amount of play time (over 1 hour).

Quite Honestly, this album doesn't stand out instrumentally like other albums such as Lugal Ki En. This album crushed almost every other in terms of vocals and possibly lyrics. Luke Griffin's vocals are pretty unique in this genre and fast as hell. Also the topic of the songs (consumerism, propaganda, anti-authoritarian, anti-war) are not the typical ""death and darkness"" lyrical content that this genre typically shows."

Criminally underrated release this year. Clocks in at 25 minutes and includes an intro and 2 instrumental interlude tracks. Might seem like an EP with filler but it really plays through like a cohesive album. The ""filler"" tracks are beautifully composed piano or guitar pieces that somehow don't sound out of place sprinkled between the raw aggression of the rest of the album.

This album will satisfy the entire deathcore palette. From fast blasting with high shrieking vocals, to old school hardcore 2 step with yelling, to punk riffs with melody, to absolutely crushing breakdowns and deep growls. While I think it will be tough to top Rings Of Saturn or Aversions Crown this year, Seditionist had one of the best releases of 2014 in my opinion. *Retract/Relapse* is a great step up from their solid debut EP *Memento Mori* and should solidify them on any deathcore fans watch list."

"Betraying The Martyrs Confirm Mega UK / Euro Tour For 2015 with Texas In July, Upon This Dawning and Make Them Suffer","At least where I was, the crowd response for TaiM was wild. Like a bomb went off. It was so much fun, dancers and moshers alike were having a great time. Same for WtR, but since they played lower on the bill the pits weren't as hard, though they put on a flawless show.

That being said, I literally had to force myself to leave the room because I was laughing so hard towards the end of BtM's set. They were that bad. There seemed to be 10 people who came to see them in the crowd, and the only other time the audience had any response was during their frozen cover, which seemed to last eight minutes; and even then it seemed like it was mostly out of pity.

I don't even know why they were playing under WtR to begin with... that just doesn't even make sense"

"Check out my bands Sample songs, album coming soon! Would love to hear feedback! Its very symphonic and black metal inspired deathcore, so stay away if thats not your thing :)","Yeah man! As far as core music goes: Make Them Suffer, and new carnifex. Outside core: Goatwhore, Dimmu Borgir, Alghazanth, Abigail Williams, Enslavement Of Beauty, Cradle Of Filth. I love black/symphonic metal and deathcore, so combining the two makes perfect sense."
"Check out my bands Sample songs, album coming soon! Would love to hear feedback! Its very symphonic and black metal inspired deathcore, so stay away if thats not your thing :)","A better sound for the drums is the only thing that stands out to me as being necessary for improvement. A more organic-sounding, heavy kick would really help round out the -core elements and make it all flow nicer. 

It's kind of touch-and-go with this sort of fusion, ""blackcore"" or whathaveyou, but as black metal has been my favourite subgenre since I was 9, and deathcore has become one of my favourites just in recent years, I'm glad to see someone's taking the reigns and actually making great music with this formula. 

Granted, you'll have bands like Into Infernus and Lorelei to compete with, but these samples definitely show a little more ""expertise"" when it comes to incorporating the black metal elements in, and the symphonic bits coupled with nice deathcore riffs are really pleasant to listen to. 

But I think the vocals could honestly make or break this endeavor, so I hope your vocalist is capable enough to handle it. Fusing the extremity of deathcore vocals and black metal vocals is challenging enough as is, but also falls victim to the near-paradoxal standard that if it isn't amazing, it sucks beyond belief. From what I've heard off your bandcamp, your vocalist can do some good low growls and some wicked high screams, but he's gonna need to kick it into overdrive for this newer stuff.

Anyway, just my feedback. I really like the sound you've got so far, and hope to hear more from you guys soon."
"Check out my bands Sample songs, album coming soon! Would love to hear feedback! Its very symphonic and black metal inspired deathcore, so stay away if thats not your thing :)","Thanks for the feedback!

As far as drums go, I see what you're saying. I've worked probably more on the drum sound than anything else so far, I'm fairly happy with it, but as you said, the kick isn't fantastic. I'm still working on it, and hopefully it'll sound a bit better by release.

Vocals are very important to me, I've told our vocalist that he needs to step it up for this one, and he's been practising his ass off. If im not happy with the sound, i'll find someone else, I've already told him this and hes fine with it. I think he can do it though.

Thanks for being critical, it really helps to make this album better overall. Glad you are liking most of it so far though! \m/"
"Attila or The Holy Guile?","Which band do you prefer and why? "
"Attila or The Holy Guile?","The Holy Guile, I dont love the rapping in general, but Saud is better than Fronz at it"
"Attila or The Holy Guile?","Well said! I personally prefer Saud's voice better."
"Attila or The Holy Guile?","They're both fucking terrible."
"Attila or The Holy Guile?","I like both as much actually."
"Attila or The Holy Guile?","I'm not fan of either really. But Early Attila and current The Holy Guile over current Attila and early The Holy Guile (I hated FSU).

"
"Attila or The Holy Guile?","It's interesting how one gets better an the other worse"
"Attila or The Holy Guile?","The Crimson Armada circa 2009 when they put out Guardians. The Holy Guile is just ... meh. And Attila. Yeah, no. Just no."
"Attila or The Holy Guile?","I've recently been getting really into Attila. I never used to like the whole ""party-core"" but the breakdowns and vocal screams that Fonz does is pretty good IMO."
"Attila or The Holy Guile?","How would you compare them to The Holy Guile?"
"Attila or The Holy Guile?","Just listened to them.. its Attila 2.0

"
"Attila or The Holy Guile?","That could be either good or bad. "
"Attila or The Holy Guile?","it's good and bad. I don't like the whole rap thing with attila and I don't like the whole fast paced high pitched vocals. but the breakdowns and lows of both are what keep me listing cause damn it's brutal!! 

as far as everything goes i would rate Attila at a 7.8/10 and THG at a 7.9/10. I shall listen to THG more tho! thanks for the new band :)"

We did an EP a bit before this show in the vid, so the lineup was different. I was happy with the quality of the mix/recording though. Dude def tuned up the drums nice, and recorded from an analog source into digital for post to make it a bit more like our live sound than straight pro-tools.

"Whitechapel - Let Me Burn (Lyrics)","Coming from someone who only really like The Somatic Defilement, the new record is definitely a ""grows on you"" type. Phil's vocals are great as always, and they're still very dynamic in a much different way, and the groove is undeniable. But while I've grown to like it over time, this new record kind of lacks the punch that TSD and their other earlier stuff had."

They lost both James (The guttural vocalist) and Chris (The drummer/ backup vocalist) and when they finally found replacements they went almost inactive. To me it seems like Bryan (As far as I know he's supposed to be the new vocalist for KC) is only working with dealey plaza and it feels like he's ignoring the fact that KC exists. This is just one of my theories and I hope that they will arise from the ashes soon.

"Vincent Bennett","These comments say otherwise. Unless of course these events are made up. Doesn't seem like something to make up though.

"Vincent Bennett","People named Johnathan go by John though, that doesn't really seem like why."
"Vincent Bennett","But not everyone subscribes to that idea, plenty of Matthews only want be called Matthew and not Matt, and vice versa. It's their name, they are free to reject the short version if they want. Like, if my name was William but you kept calling me Bill, I would think you were kinda being an asshole."
"Vincent Bennett","I believe it's because his father is called Vince, and he despises his father.
Not completely sure.  That's what my friend)who is a huggeee TAS fan) told me.

Also, met Vincent on the Eternal Enemies Tour.  He is one of the most genuine, cool, nice person I have ever met.  We talked about his music, our shirts(TAS and Emmure crewnecks) and we took pictures. One of the best times of my life."

"Give me your saddest songs","Hey there, everyone.  I'm kind of in a slump, so I'd like some sad stuff to go along with it.  Any recommendations?"
"Give me your saddest songs","Animosity's 3rd album Animal, the song ""You Can't Win"". I was in college at UC Santa Cruz at the time and my girlfriend's sister Rebecca was dating the lead singer of **Animosity**, Leo Miller. It was my 21st birthday, Oct 1st 2005 when I got a call from Leo saying Rebecca had been in a motorcycle accident on the way to his concert in San Francisco and she was dead.

The song lyric: *""Not a day goes by when I didn't wish I were still living in September 2005.""* is because Rebecca was still alive in September 2005. She was 19 years old. Hit by a neo-nazi fuckhead 2 weeks out of prison driving on meth on the opposite side of the road (he got 40 years for 2nd degree murder).

We had to call their parent's to say what happened that night. Every time I hear that song, it reminds me. I'm still with Rebecca's sister 9 years later. Every one of my birthdays is Rebecca's deathday.

"Give me your saddest songs","Oh you.  Clever tag you got there.  Lol.
"
"Give me your saddest songs","Someone else had asked this a while back.  I stand by my suggestions in that thread too.

**Fit for an Autopsy - The Great Gift of the World** - The disappointment and sadness to how the world is in this song is overwhelming.  It could best be described as an angry sadness to these ears.

**Hester Prynne - Grimy** - This song sounds as though it describes depression full on.  The section where the clean vox are, is far from cheesy.  The singer sounds so exhausted and miserable.  It really adds to that album.  I enjoyed Black Heart Market a lot.  

**All Shall Perish - Songs for the Damned** - The awesomeness in this song is just too much to bear.  a.  It name drops a shit tone of classic metal albums.  b.  it has a profound sense of unhappiness in it.  Just fantastic.  

Also, if you are into hardcore/metalcore much at all:  
Damnation A.D - No More Dreams of Happy Endings  
Poison the Well - The Opposite of December  
American Nightmare - Background Music  
Misery Signals - Of Malice and the Magnum Heart  
Disembodied - If Only God Knew the Rest Were Dead  
All Else Failed - Archetype  

These albums have been chosen as all of them have lots of overarching themes of sadness, misery, pain, depression and what have you.  I have a crap ton of this type of stuff.  Especially All Else Failed's Archetype, holy shit, just listen to The Hutton Play on that album.  That is pure misery he's conveying.

"Top 10 Deathcore albums of all time?","1) Ingested - The Architect Of Extinction

- These guys are lyrical geniuses. The flow and way every single song and even sentence was put together was just perfect.

2) Black Toungue - Born Hanged / Falsifier [Redux]

- For anyone who hasn't checked out the Redux, it's SO much better than the normal EP's and amazingly Brutal in my opinion.

3) Rings of Saturn - Lugal Ki En

- Perfect combination between technicality and musicality in one album.

4) Thy Art Is Murder - Hate

- Pure brutality.

5) Infant Annihilator - The Palpable Leprosy Of Pollution
Now, these guys don't take themselves too serious, but I think that Eddie Pickard and Aaron Kitcher are an amazingly deadly combination. A very good mix between brutality, technicality and musicality.

6) Thy Art Is Murder - Infinite Death EP

- It was good, but it was a bit too chaotic for me. Still an amazing EP with some insane lyrics.

7) Born of Osiris - Tomorrow We Die Alive

- Just felt like should put this here, although it may be considered Metalcore, I think its lyrics were quite different and it had a nice techno kind of feel to it.

8) Veil of Maya - Eclipse

- It's different, in a rather positive way. It had some more flow than the typical Deathcore album for me.

9) Rings of Saturn - Enbryotic Anomaly

- Sheer awesomeness and it being the first album of an amazing new twist to the genre.

10) Suicide Silence - The Cleansing.

- I know that this will be a rather unpopular opinion but I think that this is just one of the classics. It's the album that got me into Deathcore and I still like it.

Just a heads up, it's ""Ibis"", not ""Abyss"". I wouldn't normally have the sense to correct it, but I'm wearing the shirt right now.

"When someone asks you ""Hey, what is deathcore?"" what is your best example you'd show them?","Really depends on who asks. For example if it's a Slipknot fan then I'd show them early Whitechapel or Carnifex. If it's a non-metal musician (like they play an instrument but not in a metal style) I'd show them Veil of Maya, maybe early Born of Osiris. If it's a punk fan I'd show them The Acacia Strain. All other categories I think it pretty much doesn't matter, they will regard it as terrible noise no matter which band it is.

I already know that this is the only release of this DVD in the states and I have been told that peope have given up a fair amount to get it. Im not posting here to sell it, im just posting to see if anyone could give me a estimated worth on this piece. Thanks"

"Rare Suicide Silence release","[Close](http://m.hottopic.com/hottopic/Suicide+Silence+-+The+Black+Crown+Deluxe+CDDVD-311879.jsp) it's $12.99 but yeah, not priceless or anything. Did I really have to look that up for you OP?"
"Rare Suicide Silence release","Theres only 1000 made in the US, its not for sale anywhere. The German and UK releases are cheap because the DVD's are region locked and cant be played in the states without a region free player. "

"Rare Suicide Silence release","Agreed. This album definitely influenced my tastes. I actually have the  CD mounted in a frame with some pictures from the show where I got the sigs.  Good times, sad Mitch is gone though.

Thank for the input"
"Rare Suicide Silence release","I have it too, never realized it was rare, im interested to see what people are willing to pay"
"Rare Suicide Silence release","No one is going to pay over 20$ for it I'm sure"
"Rare Suicide Silence release","I reckon it would go for more than that. I have no idea how many Mitch signed before his death, but I can't imagine that the number was too high. I can't find any signed copies of it online, so it would be interesting to see what it would go for on Ebay if you ever sold it. "

"The history of deathcore?","Hey is there any articles/videos that have a good write up of the history of deathcore?

From the first bands who started it.. to all the major bands that really carried the genre... all the different trends throughout the years (for instance- theres a lot of downtempo stuff floating around atm... back in 2009-2010 there was a lot of material that tried to be really heavy and focused on breakdowns.... there was the whole djent craze.. etc)

I haven't found anything that went over the genre in such detail. It would be cool if somebody could find something like this... or if somebody who is a bit more knowledgeable do a write up on reddit or something.  "
"The history of deathcore?","It's a fusion of a bunch of different genres of music.
A mix of death metal, hardcore punk, grind, etc.

Hardcore/punk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN1-rbE7hN8
fuuuuuuuusion HA
Deathmetal/punk/grind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs_9Lx8F6Sw

Time progresses, refined sounds, different styles of vocals emerge.
In 2002, the apex of deathcore was released in my opinion. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aocz0p5DSmo

This trend continues, some bands slow their tempo, some speed their shit up, in 2007 this beast was released: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dwg3111s4ek

2008 onward brings in the heavy chuggggggs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dzkyl9NYg4o

you also start to see a rise in popularity of bands such as: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5Y4r9vFyc4 

Then the whole djent stuff is everywhere now, which I believe will lose its appeal in the next couple years. An example of relatively early ""djent"":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuFmNZ09_Y8

And the ones who brought djent into popularity: http://youtu.be/6J4Ye7nRT0s

You must remember that the term djent really only describes the guitar tone. A lot of djent bands incorporate off beat breakdowns and time signatures.

This is of course a pretty condense explanation, but I hope it gives you an idea of the different sounds through the years."

"The history of deathcore?","the first deathcore bands are at the end of the decade of the 90s and early 2000s the first band was already talk of a merger of Death Metal / Metalcore / Hardcore is DEFORMITY belgium

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT8Up76RcCE

Another example is CRAWLSPACE (2001) with his album ""Enter the realm chaos""  basically sounds Cannibal Corpse mixed with Metalcore and Beatdown.

This is easily my favorite deathcore band, these dudes got signed back in like 2009 to Metal Blade but they've been around since 2006 or something like that.  They broke up a few weeks after getting signed but they're back together now which is amazing to me.  I seriously suggest checking more of their stuff out, the song I linked is just their fan favorite.

I remember someone posted a blog saying everything wrong with each member and they decided to call it quits.

This is the last video he made. NSFL probably for some people who do not want to see the last words of person who then went and committed a school shooting. Though, this is pretty consistent with what we listen to on the daily if you're in this sub.

"INGESTED - The Architect of Extinction","Ingested doesnt change much between each album, but they seem to still progress and they sound more collected, like they started with one style of writing, and just continuously improved on the small problems rather than scraping it for the next album"
"INGESTED - The Architect of Extinction","It's a masterpiece. I expected no less. "
"INGESTED - The Architect of Extinction","This album, Acrania's new album, and Vulvodynia's new album all fall in this new really exciting little bag for me. They are over the top brutal, but they maintain that groove and slam vibe (some more than others), that really bring a lot to the genre. 

I would love to see this trend continue. I like the way these albums are produced, but most of all, I really like the Slam meets Deathcore elements that all have. 

If you have any recommendations for me, let me know!

This would have been my album of the year if it was release a few weeks earlier. I dig RoS new album and it's brutal. But it's not as brutal (imo) as this album which still maintains some technicality and who doesn't love some good ol' murder cut scenes in the middle too. 

I also love the instrumental on this album. I think it is one of my favorite tracks. The main riff that runs down the neck almost sounds like the Foo Fighters little movement down the neck in Everlong, but a lot heavier and with a lot of extra yummies going on in and around it.

Any way, personally cannot say enough good stuff about it. "

"What ever happened to A Dead Silence?","I discovered this band from Australia a couple years ago called A Dead Silence. Here is a [sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8sgjltkGGs). They released an ep titled 'Catharsis' in 2012. It's one of my favourite eps of all time! Naturally, Iliked them on facebook so that I could stay informed about their future releases. Well, they talked about how they were going to release an album in Fall of 2014... but never did. There has also not been any activity on their page since November of last year... Just wondering if anyone knows anything about this band? Did they break up? Financial troubles? Whatever it is, it's really too bad. I thought this band had a lot of promise.
"
"What ever happened to A Dead Silence?","You already said that their page hasn't been updated. I liked them too. But I'm accustomed, in a way, to Australian bands often breaking up :/."

"Black Tongue vinyl never arriving?","Hey guys, has anyone actually received their Black Tongue ""Born Hanged"" vinyl from Total Deathcore? Cause I haven't. None of my emails have been responded too, and whoever runs the Facebook page has deleted my posts to their wall - needless to say I'm pretty infuriated by the whole thing, as they've essentially scammed me out of money."
"Black Tongue vinyl never arriving?","Total Deathcore are useless cunts, a lot of people never received their order "
"Black Tongue vinyl never arriving?","well, in a way that's a comfort to know I'm not the only one - but that's fucked. Doesn't one of the dudes who runs Total Deathcore lurk around this part of Reddit?"
"Black Tongue vinyl never arriving?","Are you serious? I remember when it had been like 7 or 8 months post-release and people were making these threads. Now I'm really curious if *anyone's* gotten them at all.

I'm inclined to think they probably haven't even printed the vinyl, and at this rate, I guess they aren't going to. 

If anyone can get ahold of any of the TD guys, I'd *really* like to see what they have to say, if they have the balls to say anything."
"Black Tongue vinyl never arriving?","/u/fungunzbuff runs TD with Mike. You can try hitting him up here.

But, I can safely say, that some of the orders were shipped and obtained. I've seen a dozen or so people posting photos of their Born Hanged vinyl in a deathcore merch Facebook group I'm apart of. "
"Black Tongue vinyl never arriving?","&gt; /u/fungunzbuff

yeah I'll be curious if this guy bothers to reply or comment here - seeing as I've had zero response from anyone from Total Deathcore. They've obviously fucked up somehow, and now are pretending as if the people who paid for this never existed."

First album is still the best tho "
"Rings of Saturn - Corpses Thrown Across The Sky","I guess I have to agree with you even though I am a big fan of that band "
"Rings of Saturn - Corpses Thrown Across The Sky","I personally preferred the mixing of Dingir and I couldn't get into their first album, wasn't a fan of the production and I just didn't enjoy it.

"All Shall Perish - Songs for the Damned (Not your typical deathcore, but my favorite ASP song)","Actually kinda me too. SS's instrumentals are nowhere near the quality of ASP."
"All Shall Perish - Songs for the Damned (Not your typical deathcore, but my favorite ASP song)","I agree with this. All Shall Perish had (has?) much more musical talent, but pre-Black Crown SS was fucking brutal man."
"All Shall Perish - Songs for the Damned (Not your typical deathcore, but my favorite ASP song)","SS's problem was never musical talent, it's composition. Both their guitarists are excellent at what they do, and every drummer they've had thus far has been a force to be reckoned with, but no matter what they struggle to translate that skill into interesting and captivating instrumental composition. Case and point: the solo in ""Wake Up"". There's nothing bad about it, but it completely lacks the energy of the rest of the song and almost takes away from it."
"All Shall Perish - Songs for the Damned (Not your typical deathcore, but my favorite ASP song)","Man I've tried to describe what SS lacked, and this explains it perfectly.

"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","What got you into deathcore? Do you prefer deathcore over death metal? Or vice versa? Why? 

(I'm pretty bored at the moment and just really curious. I'd have to say that the band that specifically got me into deathcore would have to be Whitechapel and then Suicide Silence.)"
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Born of Osiris - The New Reign

All Shall Perish - The Price of Existence

Suicide Silence - The Cleansing

Whitechapel - This Is Exile

Those were the 4 albums that got me into deathcore, and I never really listened to death metal so I can't say I prefer deathcore over it"
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Job For a Cowboy and By Blood and Iron.

I listen to a lot of metalcore too and I started to want more heavy and less cleans so I progressed to deathcore and was not dissappointed"
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","As Blood Runs Black. Allegience.

This is the album that made me transcend into this awesome genre. Its still one of my top 3 favorite albums ever. My top 3 (in no specific order) being ABRB - Allegience, Lorna Shore - Maleficium, Thirteen Bled Promises - Heliopause Fleets."
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Impending Doom - Nailed. Dead. Risen.
"
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","In the Midst of Lions (R.I.P.)got me started on deathcore. When I saw them live. They were from St. Louis and we're amazing. Then I went to carnifex, whitechapel, As Blood Runs Black, etc. 

I like death core better because I love the rhythm in music more than anything and death metal is just to constricted and feels robotic. ""We're a deathmetal band and to compete we have to have the most INTENSE solos, most black clothes, most long hair for headbanging..."" and so on. Death core is way more casual. Also, I probably like core more because it's the catchiest. Not that death metal is bad, but I really like a good breakdown and the screams are entirely different. 

Why do so many people like suicide silence? I just can't get into it. "
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","I saw In The Midst of Lions right before they broke up. They were awesome. It was actually on the last Thrash and Burn Tour back in 2011! Great show. Carnifex is another one of my favorite deathcore bands. I haven't really been able to follow As Blood Runs Black past their album Allegiance. Just not all that crazy about them. 

I definitely know what you mean about the dynamic rhythmic feel that deathcore has as opposed to death metal. I usually prefer something that tends to change a bit through the song. Death metal definitely does feel constricted. But there are plenty of times that that's what I'm in the mood for. Sometimes all I want to listen to is Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, or Dying Fetus. So for me I think it all has to do with my mood.

I don't know what it is about Suicide Silence. I've always loved them since I first got into deathcore. I fell in love with The Cleansing when I first heard it. I think a part of my love for them has to do with when I saw them at the 2011 Mayhem Fest. Mitch Lucker's dynamic stage presence really got me (R.I.P.) "
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Different strokes for different folks. I completely understand the craving for a specific sound. Maybe you could recommend me a song and I'll try it.

"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Still one of my favorite deathcore bands"
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Same bands got me into deathcore as well. I just got into heavier music as I got older and scouted for bands. Death metal and deathcore are probably equal for me. I like me some WhiteChapel, Born of Osiris and Ingested but sometimes I want Job for a Cowboy, Death, Nile or Gojira."
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Born of Osiris are pretty damn awesome. In regards to death metal, Death is definitely my favorite. Leprosy and Spiritual Healing are such great albums. Gojira is pretty great, but I never really followed them that much. And you can never go wrong with Nile. "
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","I just find it interesting that JFAC used to be on the other side of that list."
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","JFAC and TAIM first albums, chelsea grin and whitechapel as well. Came from metalcore originally, merged through All Shall Perish."
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Winds of Plague and Knights of the Abyss. Discovered both on MySpace and couldn't get enough."
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Molotov Solution, specifically tier song The Final Hour. So good"
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Chelsea Grin really. Really wasn't in to it at first, then my friend wanted me to learn a few songs from CG and one from BOO on bass and I was pretty hooked on it. Raw intensity and simplicity go well together, especially while playing. I now listen to Danza (if you'd call that deathcore) and Rings of Saturn almost exclusively, with a little bit of CG and Carnifex in the mix.

It widened my mind on music and really humbled me on the subject of ""technical is always better"". Used to hate CG and the like because all i heard were open notes and bends. Now love it"
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Suicide Silence - The Cleansing 

Chelsea Grin - Self titled EP

Job For a Cowboy - Doom EP

Bring Me the Horizon - Count Your Blessings 

after that i started listening to as blood runs black, oceano, whitechapel, ect."
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Suicide silence, job for a cowboy, oceano, heaven shall burn and make them suffer"
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Elysia and molotov solution 

and all the others such as jfac, and impending doom.  SS played a big part also, 

the biggest memory which finally turned me that was a good bridge of hardcore and death influences was animosity empires....still one of my fav albums to date."
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Suicide Silence obviously. The Price of Beauty and Unanswered are great tracks. Chelsea Smile by BMTH also helped, but that's not really deathcore.


I love Death Metal, specially stuff like Decapitated, Dying Fetus, Behemoth or Cattle Decapitation. But at the end of the day i still prefer deathcore over death metal because of its catchiness and breakdowns."
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Whitechapel - To All That Are Dead (that exact song got me into deathcore)

I just liked how it sounded, it had a lot of power in it compared to the other shit I listened to. I don't have any preference between deathcore or death metal."
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","I'm gonna be a generic scene kid here and say Suicide Silence. It was Slaves To Substance that really caught my attention "
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","The Red Cord - Fused Together in Revolving Doors was the first me --&gt; Then Through the Eyes of the Dead - The Scars of Ages --&gt; The Taste of Blood - Predator --&gt; From there it just got heavier and heavier.  

I started off as big thrash/death metal fan(still am) but back then when these genres were first mixing it was blowing my mind  at how heavy these bands doing this could be."
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Boris The Blade basically they won me over after I saw them live in 2013."
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","Whitechapel and Born of Osiris. I originally was a big post hardcore / generic metal core fan, then whilst browsing YouTube a video for Whitechapel's The saw is the law appeared (yeah not been a fan of the genre for too long) and I liked it. Soon after that o found BoO and had no idea them and Whitechapel were the same style of metal"
"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","By watching backyard wrestling videos produced by the guitarist of Boris the Blade in around 2003-2006. He just used to throw melodic death metal and like nu metal tracks over their fights and i guess as he got into more heavier stuff he incorporated that in their videos and I was hooked on what I watching and the music. "

"What was/were the band(s) that got you into deathcore specifically?","BMTH is one of those bands that everyone loves to hate. I even jumped on that bandwagon myself a while back. For a while I really couldn't get into them. Then it wasn't until about two or three years ago I listened to them again and was like ""Wow, they're actually not THAT bad."" They're a pretty good band in my opinion. "

"As Blood Runs Black getting negative press. Thoughts on the issue?","[deleted]"
"As Blood Runs Black getting negative press. Thoughts on the issue?","It's bullshit. There should be some sort of recourse for the fans through indiegogo to get their money back"
"As Blood Runs Black getting negative press. Thoughts on the issue?","Sucks for the people that gave money to this. I feel like a band struggling as much as ABRB has been would do their best to keep their reputation in check.

Also, the circle jerk on MetalSucks is strong enough to alter Earth's orbit."

"As Blood Runs Black getting negative press. Thoughts on the issue?","It's funny though."
"As Blood Runs Black getting negative press. Thoughts on the issue?","Bands should uphold their end of the bargain with crowd funding."
"As Blood Runs Black getting negative press. Thoughts on the issue?","I think if it's true, it's really shitty. 

I don't know the guys in ABRB so I don't know if they'd do something like this or not, but let's say they actually did.

Metalsucks is still being too harsh on them. 

Bash them for not living up to their promises, not their music. Or at least save the music bashing for a review. 

Now, hopefully this isn't true. "
"As Blood Runs Black getting negative press. Thoughts on the issue?","They are harsh on a lot of metalcore, so I'm not really surprised on the music bashing. I do however know of some people that did the pre-order stuff from indiegogo and haven't gotten their download yet. I would be pissed too, because I didn't order it and here I am listening to it on spotify for free... lol"
"As Blood Runs Black getting negative press. Thoughts on the issue?","Yeah. I'm not surprised that they hate -core. A lot of people seem to. 

I might not buy the album if that's really true, that's terrible. You make a promise, you fucking keep it. "
"As Blood Runs Black getting negative press. Thoughts on the issue?","I might be a bit in the wrong, but indiegogo is very much alike kickstarted right? Did they actually get the money, since from that article it stated they did not reach the target goal. On kickstarted it would mean it is a no go project. If the project would still get financed by the indiegogo campaign that way it sucks, but I think these guys have had a hard time lately so I wouldn't personally make a big deal out of it."
"As Blood Runs Black getting negative press. Thoughts on the issue?","I'm not sure honestly. 

I know on kickstarter there's flexible payment, where you still get the money even if you don't reach the goal. But I don't know anything about indiegogo.

It's still shitty regardless though. Maybe it's me, but I think if you make a promise to the fans you either:

a) Keep it, even if it means taking a financial hit

or 

b) refund them, even if it means taking a financial hit

You shouldn't make a promise you can't keep. "
"As Blood Runs Black getting negative press. Thoughts on the issue?","Hmm, I am not really sure about that kickstarter/indiegogo issue either so I can't judge that correctly. Of course you should try to keep your promises, but you can promise things now because it looks like an easy promise to keep. Maybe they just can't afford to take this financial hit. I understand the frustration about it but I would just give it some time to let the band sort this out. "
"As Blood Runs Black getting negative press. Thoughts on the issue?","If they can't do it now, they should do it later.

"
"As Blood Runs Black getting negative press. Thoughts on the issue?","Pretty sure it doesn't matter if you reach your goal. 
Ive given money to a few bands that started a campaign and didn't reach their goal. I still got my digital download and t-shirt. I think the money goes straight to the band regardless. Obviously there are fees involved but it's so minimal. There really isn't any reason for a digital download to not be able to be e-mailed out to their fans. "

---------------------------------------------

Before the fourth sacrifice destroyed the Orion Cygnus Arm

Before the skies were vomiting impending lights from a nearby dimension

The angular momentum of the Oort cloud changed, Exposing the ecliptic plane

Before Uranus destroyed his moons, The Sun took his core away.

Andromeda witnessed his act of betrayal. They knew his blood wasn´t red. 

The Sun ejected him to the depths. He was forced to stay. 

An equinox of despair darkened his poles. Ultraviolet violence corrupted it all in the galaxy. 

The agony condensed on those protoplanets. The fatal consequences reflected in billions of years. 

Satellites, secret moons, lurking star rings. A massive conjunction of death. 

When planets collide, spiral arms grow, floating like stellar corpses, disturbing star formations. 

And darkness conquers space, expanding the obscurest density waves, arousing life light years away from us. 

We all are from a small planet that orbits around a mediocre star, in the galaxy suburbs. 

Its collision will merge to form a giant elliptical force and at the end, that star will be left with none of the bodies that first were orbiting it

"The Acacia Strain - VVorld Demise (New song)","I thought the best produced album was their most monotonous to listen to: DITOM. But on the plus side, the new Legend album should sound amazing if DL is going to produce it."
"The Acacia Strain - VVorld Demise (New song)","This sound made me feel like it was 2008 again. Seing Architects open for Suicide silence, Emmure, After the Burial, and Beneath the Massacre at the clubhouse (tiny venue in Mesa AZ that got shut down after a drive by). Those were the days man.

"AngelMaker - Decay/Hell LIVE (In anticipation of tomorrow's release)","heard the album... best shit I've heard in a while.  
2015 starting strong, this is seriously a good album...prepare to get your mind blown."
"AngelMaker - Decay/Hell LIVE (In anticipation of tomorrow's release)","It was a great release. Never been huge on dual vocals, but these guys really do it well. The blond kid has a mitch lucker/Chelsea grin vibe going on in his highs and lows thay I really dig. There are a couple songs on the new album too where I mistake his highs and their cadence with the new Chelsea Grin album though the music itself and overall effort is better, imo. 

I have to say it came in a close second behind Ingested for me, but it was still really really good. Acrania, Angelmaker, and Ingested are my favorite deathcore bands right now, hands down that are on the up and up.

Next stop, new music from Lorna Shore soon, hopefully."
"AngelMaker - Decay/Hell LIVE (In anticipation of tomorrow's release)","Totally agree, they are my favorite at the moment too. Every other release just seems the same shit I've heard over and over.  
Looking forward to Lorna Shore too, favorite vocals for me."
"AngelMaker - Decay/Hell LIVE (In anticipation of tomorrow's release)","Agreed on the over and over feel of a lot of new releases. Or let downs from older bands changing direction (good for them, not good for mez). I really like the evil tone all four of those bands can have. There is a dark theme in their music or a good concept like Whitechapel's Somatic Defilement. Something that runs through the whole album. "

"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","Just finished listening to the album and this is a masterpiece. Observer ties all the loose ends together just like I feel Acrania's ""Disillusion In A Discordant System"" did at the ""Send them to the slaughterhouse"".

All of the sounds and the feel of legitimate ""doom"" make this album great. The Acacia Strain just sent a gut punch to us all. 

This is The Acacia Strain and this is what they do best. No technical guitar riffs, no complex time signatures that each guitarist and drummer plays to, just pure unadulterated hate. "
"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","I've always loved this band because of exactly what you said at the end. Nothing fancy, just pure heaviness and hatred. Something about Vincents delivery brings out the fucking demons in me haha"

"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","I wanna listen to it so bad, but I promised myself I wouldn't until my preorder CD came... This is gonna be a rough couple of days, but the positive comments on here have me beyond pumped.

Edit: It finally came... Holy shit. So worth the wait. The album is excellent, but Observer just put it over the top, it's simultaneously one of the most beautiful and terrifying songs I've ever heard. 10/10, this is AOTY material for me."
"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","I gave in... 

No regret. But I understand them feels."
"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","I don't blame you. Favorite track? How do you think it stands up to their other material?"
"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","Well it was rather hard for me to choose a favorite track, I'm stuck between Observer, Whale Shark, and Cauterizer as my favorites... 
As far as their other material goes, I wanna say Wormwood had a baby with DITOM. Gut-bustinly heavy. :D"
"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","The final song is its own album. Reminds me of Sleep's Dopesmoker right down to the effects they put on the opening riff. Really hoping they explore that more.

Otherwise usual lovely stuff. If you like Acacia cause they are the most hateful, nihilistic, ethos-lacking band out there, this is more of the same. A little less continuous/proggy/spacey then DITOM (IMO their best album as a totality, maybe not their best songs) and not the skullpounding chugfest that was Wormwood, reminds me of Continents even the intro song has that drop and hit the ground running start. "
"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","That song with the dude from incendiary is so good. A whole album with him and Vincent would be incredible.

I also really dig that 27 min song at the end. It reminds me of that of something Pig Destroyer might put out at the end of one of there albums."
"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","Definitely my favorite since Continent. Observer is super cool, too."
"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","Observer is fucking epic!"
"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","I have been waiting with baited fucking breath for this album. The first track is like a kick in the god damn mouth. I'm thoroughly impressed with this album and I think it's a great marriage of their classic and modern sound (Dead Walk/Continent + Wormwood/DITOM).

Observer is a monstrous and epic track that transcends everything the band has ever done previously.

Bury me in a nameless grave."
"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","Correct me if i'm wrong, but is that one of Matthew McConaughey's True Detective speeches in Observer?"
"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","No correction necessary. You're right.

However, listening to the songs themselves, and hearing ""Continent/Wormwood""-era Acacia in the lyrics and song style.  I noticed they brought back some speed for it(except for Observer obviously, I don't care what anyone says, that sounds like it could be straight up sludge and it is awesome.).  The hate, the pessimism, the Apocalyptic themes are all there.  I like the return of the more raw sound on this one.  Definitely a damn good album.  Now, on to waiting for Rings of Saturn's new one."

"The Acacia Strain - Coma Witch [FULL ALBUM STREAM]","If you find this boring maybe it's because what you're used to listening to is more so techdeath than deathcore or hardcore so you're wanting cool guy time signature changes and shredding while this instead punches you in the face with another breakdown, which is what its meant to do. "

"Saw Rings of Saturn + As Blood Runs Black last night","It was a great show. It was a small venue so it was cool being up close to the action. Not a huge turn out. 

Rings of Saturn killed it, BUT, they only played old stuff. I had a chance to talk to Ian, and he said since they live in different states they didn't have an opportunity to practice before going on tour which was a little disappointing. (He also signed [this awesome Dingir poster](http://imgur.com/eDYtNMO) though which was cool). Still an awesome performance nonetheless. 

As Blood Runs Black was good, but they were hard to take serious. There singer looks like a metal Justin Bieber; however, they did play a lot of new stuff. It was a pretty heavy live. I think they new album will be awesome. They also played a few old songs off of Allegiance which was cool. 

If you have a chance to see this show, I would definitely go for it. Suicide Silence / Chelsea Grin Sunday!"

"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","I don't stop here much or even visit this page very often. When I do, I only search for certain songs to see if people are suggesting other bands or feedback about the current song.

I was looking into some Emmure (yes i said it) material a few minutes ago. All I saw was extreme hatred and complete disgust towards Emmure's music and fans. Majority of the comments were people talking about the band member's life or statements outside their music. 

How does that have anything to do with their music?  

When I'm listening to music, I couldn't give two shits if it was Bin Laden singing or Elvis Presley, the music is the only thing that matters to me. Anyhow, it just irks me that people see the word Emmure in a title, and instantly downvote and write ""omg frankie is such a cunt! does anyone hate emmure like me??? giv me upvotes"".  You can probably quote me on that too. 

So, for my last question, Is this subreddit a place to discover new deathcore music or a place that defines the only good deathcore music that true deathcore fans are allowed to listen too? Emmure may have shit lyrics, shit tabs, shit sound, shit band, or whatever else the fuck you think. They are deathcore though, so instead of commenting on how much you hate them, maybe suggest better bands that sound would appeal to the crowd who listens to Emmure so we can start listening to ""better"" music."
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","I get salty looks every time I mention to anyone that I fucking love everything Attila has ever put out. Just listen to what you like and let people give themselves heartburn over shit that is of absolutely zero consequence."
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","""I'm about that life."""

"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","Attila is my favorite band and I have not disliked any of their music. I'm proud to call myself an Attila fan and It's awesome you are as well."
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","I mean when you compare Emmure to someone like The Faceless or Veil of Maya it can get a little aggravating that Emmure is just as if not more popular and they obviously aren't as talented. That said I like Goodbye to the Gallows quite a bit, and Emmure was pretty fun to see live during that time. I was totally unaware that frankie is a douche or whatever, I just thought their music got worse after The Respect Issue."
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","&gt;I mean when you compare Emmure to someone like The Faceless or Veil of Maya it can get a little aggravating that Emmure is just as if not more popular and they obviously aren't as talented.

Best analogy I can think of is this; I love steak... thick cut, dry-aged, expensive ass steak. It's really one of the finest culinary experiences IMO. You know what else I fucking love? Taco Bell. 

Both are hugely popular. Sometimes you just gotta groove with a good ol' cheesy Gordita crunch, because it hits hard and fills a need inside you. Other times, you need that exquisitely dry-aged hunk of cow flesh with all it's complex notes and textures because you're a fucking sophisticated human and you can appreciate the artistry that went into preparing it for you. Neither devalues the other, and both fill their niche at different points in your life. "
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","There is a talent to fitting the right vibe though.  If Emmure tried to get more technical it wouldn't fit their sound. So it's a bit harder to knock Emmure for that.  "
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","That's a good point, I did like their original vibe but IMO they didn't really expand on it or do anything fresh."
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","I think it's the kind of thing you can't really expand on. It's successful cause it's simplistic old school deathcore.  They've been mediocre and even good at some times,  but after deathcore took off and evolved between 08-10 there just wasn't much of a niche for them anymore.  "
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","I saw Emmure live once. Frankie is such an awesome dude though, the whole douchebag thing is pretty much all an act, I saw him outside after the show and talked to him. He really is a down to earth dude and they've got love for their fans, so fuck the people that want to hate. Oh yeah, and Thy Art Is Murder and Volumes were really kickass that night too."
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","I saw volumes here in ohio. They put on a really good show. "

"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","I saw them with whitechapel, and he was a massive cunt. Apparently Phil bozeman is usually a dick but he was much better than frankie"
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","I love Emmure. One of my favorite bands. I don't understand people's desire to put them down, but I do agree with you. There's a lot of good music out there that can be shared."
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","Kids go through school thinking they have to like a certain [anything] and it evolves from there. It's tough for people to go along thinking that they can only like a certain genre/band/etc. and then branch out, and it takes time. It's just a matter of growing up, I think."
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","I think the reason people don't like Emmure is because it's possible to play their guitar riffs on a [hockey stick.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF8psEdwVVo&amp;feature=youtu.be)"
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","For starters, I love Emmure, especially Goodbye to the Gallows. That being said, I also think that Emmure has some hilarious songs in terms of musicianship and I think Frankie Palmeri does have a propensity to be a douche sometimes. And I enjoy laughing at them while enjoying their music. 

I think the problem with music is everyone has an opinion they feel is fact as opposed to understanding that this is just their opinion. Shut the fuck up and listen, and have an opinion you can share, and if that opinion is a low level comment about how the singer jerks off to We Came as Romans or Falling In Reverse who cares; thanks for being a part of the scene because without fucktards like you, it would be boring (I'm using the universal fucktard not you per se). 

And a lot of people also have a really hard time approaching music with an open mind these days (unfortunately). But, it's what makes the scene the scene, and we have to admire it for that. You can take any genre whether it be pop, rock, classical etc and there will always be a village idiot. It's something that strikes more to the core of what people are generally like as people than genre or music taste. Some people are simply idiots who will hold onto their opinion until the church burns down, and they'll be in the church at the alter receiting their opinion while it burns, and you know what... fuck'em let'em burn. 

This sub is about finding music that YOU like. Not that someone else likes or that someone else thinks is good. If your aesthetic fits the music you are listening too sweet! If it doesn't change it. 

That being said, we are on Reddit. I think we should let the trolling, short sided and shallow comments continue! If the internet isn't pissing people off, the internet is not working properly. 

LONG LIVE THE SCENE \nn/ (fucktards and all)"
"Why all the hatred on certain bands?","I'm going to simply explain the reason I don't like Emmure. 90% because of Frankies vocal style. To me, it sounds like he's pushing out a serious turd when he pushes his cleans really hard, that and I think his screams are amateur at best. The same goes to the rest of the band.I couldn't give two hot steeming dumps about who evers a douche and who ever is ""a really down to earth dude."" I just don't care for their music.

On the upside for Emmure, I saw them open once and they were entertaining to me but nothing more than that."

"Looking for a suggestion","hey guys so I'm just getting into death core,I've been in to metal core for a super long time and I'm looking for something harder. I was wondering if you guys could suggest some stuff thats more melodic and maybe even some clean vocal. I love don't ask don't tell and clockwork by CG. Also I'm getting into within the ruins especially gods amongst men. Ive been into immure for a while not sure if you'd consider them death core or not. Anything you guys could suggest would be sick. thanks"
"Looking for a suggestion","I got your back dude, I've been on the hunt for deathcore bands with good clean vocals forever. Everyone always suggests Betraying The Martyrs and stuff like Emmure/Attila/all the rapcore but here are some bands that don't sacrifice a shred of brutality for those cleans:

Ovid's Withering: Not only are JJ's vocals as flawless as can be, his style is very traditional death/almost viking-metal-influenced, so it's really easy to get into them for people who aren't as into the heavier side of extreme vocals. Their bassist throws clean passages in on some songs here and there, and the dude's got a really nice voice. Perfectly suits the music, compliments the already-phenominal instrumentals, you can't go wrong. They're easily one of the best deathcore acts out there, and they throw down some wicked djenty madness too, so there's something for everyone.

Erra: They're not really deathcore - not even close really - but Erra's newest EP ""Moments of Clarity"" features a brand new vocalist who primarily uses a thick, deep growl that can honestly compete with some of the better deathcore screamers out there. They're really a djent-driven metalcore outfit if you want to get technical, but they can get pretty heavy with it too. The big thing here is the guitarist, Jesse Cash. Not only is his guitar work completely jaw-dropping at times, he delivers some of the best clean choruses in metalcore.

Akeldama: Another prog/djent band, what a surprise. These guys rip some sick tunes, *if* you like stuff that's very technical with the time, but more ambient/graceful with the melodies. They can be a *little* bland at times, and the harsh vocals are *good* but nothing really to write home about. The highlight of this band is its founder: Andrew Zink. Dude is talented as fuck, and his clean singing is kind of ridiculous. I don't know if you ever wanted to hear a full-grown bearded man sing higher than Mariah Carey, but that's what you get with Akeldama. And while I'll admit, it's a rather abrasive sound to most at first listen, but you never know who might like what, so I'll suggest it to you as well.

Into Infernus: Andrew Zink is back, and this time he brought Norway's shameful past with him. Into Infernus is a symphonic black metal/deathcore/""KVLT as FVCK"" fusion band, and is definitely something to behold. There are three vocalists; one who does high, raspy black metal screams and screeches, one who does deathcore-style lows and gutterals, and Zink himself, who writes, composes, and records all of the instrumentals, co-writes the lyrical content, performs theatrical voices as narration throughout the songs, all of which tell stories influenced by Christian myths and biblical stories (with an emphasis on Satan and Satany-like things. It *is* black metal after all), and he does all the clean vocals throughout their newest album, ""The End of Eden"", and I have to say they're even more astounding than in Akeldama's songs.

Shadow Of The Colossus: all-around just a fantastic band. Amazing guitar work, excellent deathcore vocals, and solid cleans and metalcore screaming from the second vocalist. The percussion is otherworldly, the melodies are outstanding, and the breakdowns are beautiful and brutal at the same time.

They're... they're *brutiful...*

And finally, Shokran: because Ancient Egyptian folk djentcore. Because why not.

That's all I can think of now, and I apologize for using my mobile so I can't provide any links, but I reckon these should be a good place to start. I tried to stick with bands you probably haven't heard too much of if you're relatively new to deathcore, so just let me know if any of these stand out to you, and I can suggest some other bands like them."

"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","I think Colin fits the frontman image better  but Poida has some, if not the best vocals in Australia next to CJ. "
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","I'm just hope that Poida is able to keep working with I, Valiance (although that's probably unlikely). Their new EP is so sick "
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","IV stated on facebook that he left for Aversions Crown."
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","Well that's just phenominally disappointing..."
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","yep, I literally just started listening to the EP like 3 days ago and it blew me away, then today I saw that their vocalist was moving to AC, great for AC but I hope that the vocalist that fills in for IV is good, he has some big shoes to fill"
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","They're definitely going to have to face a departure of style, though. I'm sure whomever they find will live up to fan expectations, but even still, the particular atmosphere and intensity of The Reject Of Humanity is really catalyzed by Mark's vocals."
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","Dude filling in is actually a decent vocalist, used to play in Arbour Lane and has filled in on the odd thy art show. "
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","I'm pretty bummed, but hopefully they get someone else who can hang"
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","I'm ok with this, seeing as Mark is truly brutal as fuck, but I am disappointed to see him leave I, Valiance. Their new EP is fucking amazing. And it really sucks that Colin's leaving at all. He was becoming one of my favourite vocalists."
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","I, Valiance had potential to become the best deathcore band from Australia, but Aversions Crown are already top 3 so i don't know how to feel about this."
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","Am I correct in assuming Thy Art is Murder is either #1 or 2?"
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","Correct. #2"
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","Alright, I'll bite. Who's #1?

*I swear to CJ if you say Parkway Drive...*"
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","Make Them Suffer.

Neverbloom &gt; Hate, but Infinite Death/Adversary &gt; Neverbloom. I like to think that Let it go song didn't happen."
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","That's an interesting take. I personally like Hate far more than Neverbloom, but as far as deathcore goes, I reckon Neverbloom is easily one of, if not the best-composed album of the genre. I'd still put Thy Art at the #1 slot for Aussie bands, but Make Them Suffer surely doesn't get enough credit. 

A Night In Texas also deserves to be somewhere on the list, IMO."
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","Neverbloom is one of the better composed albums in all of music in my opinion, not just deathcore "
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","I think hate had a few better single songs. But infinite death was better as a whole."
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","(Parkway Drive is metalcore)"
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","Yes, thank you for explaining my joke."
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","Great move from Mark Poida! Cant wait to hear what Aversions will be like, but i Prefer the I, Valiance EP to last two Aversions albums,  that was special"
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","Don't know how this guys gonna fit with Aversions. Need to wait for a demo or something."
"Collin from Aversions crown is stepping down.","Mark won't disappoint.
I for one am very okay with this change, although its still pretty unfortunate. "

"Heaviest song with lowest vocals and instrumentals?","I think 1776 is much better. The band is just straight up heavy as fuck. Sound very good live too."
"Heaviest song with lowest vocals and instrumentals?","Found it here a few months back, but this whole (short) ep is stoopid heavy and well produced. Don't believe they're particularly well known as of yet.

"Looking for an Instrumental for Scars by Upon a Burning Body. Any help?","Try and eq the original to filter out vocals yourself then do a good and extensive vocal job.

I've been playing in Martyr Defiled since 2007, and have written every lyric for Martyr Defiled. I've feel I've improved a lot as a vocalist in my old age - listening to my old songs makes me cringe!

"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Ah the Baphomet shirt was by our man Robert Borbas - aka Grindesign! He designed a few bits for us way back when, he even put on a show for us in his home town of Budapest.

We sold out of Ecophagy years ago - there are still a few copies knocking around that importers in the US purchased then held in warehouses, you can pick those up on eBay. We may do a limited repress in the future! 

And NHNM never actually got a physical release in Aus - so your only way is importing it from europe! sorry dude :("
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","kinda lame question, but what are the best tips you can give to upcoming bands? cheers from austria man, you guys rule!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Play as many shows in as many places as you can! Bug promoters and play for free, and eventually enough people will know you that you can ask for some petrol money.

My general rule of thumb is that a good band never goes unheard. In this day and age of social media and instant sharing to all your friends, we've never been able to grow as creative people as much as we can right now. Look at the incredible success people like Infant Annihilator/Black Tongue and Lorna Shore have had worldwide because they're writing great music, and people want to share it for them. A lot of the hard work is taken out of being a band these days because your fans will promote your band for you!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Bozeman or Erian?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Fuck! If I had to choose:

Somatic/This Is Exile Bozeman &gt; OTB Erian

DI Erian &gt; Post-TIE Bozeman"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","are you planning on being a vocalist for as long as you possibly can or are there any other plans for the future? "
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Being in a band is really hard on your family, friends and relationship. I love being away, I love playing shows and I love being in a band but it isn't something I'd choose to do forever - I think whilst I'm doing it and MD is worth me putting the people close to me through me being away regularly then I'm gonna keep on doing it. Eventually I'll settle down somewhere, get a real job and start living the grind - but that won't be any time soon!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Have to hop on the merch-bandwagon! I own two of your shirts, which I absolutely love. My question for you Matt, what's your favorite MD shirt?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Thanks so much for picking up merch, it really really helps! You're not by any chance Sara Hultgren, are you? I remember seeing that name crop up when I've been making the postage labels!

I really really love our logo. We've had 3 or 4 logos in our time, and the latest one is perhaps my favourite piece of artwork we've ever had as a band. Its so recognisable from any distance at any size - and as soon as you see it, you know who's logo it is!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Sara is my sister! She gave me one of the shirts as a gift, which was fuckin' awesome. That you remember our surname is quite brilliant! Time to pop a pint and listen to In Shadows! "
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Aside from other bands, what is your biggest source of inspiration in lyrics? Big fan from Sweden \m/"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","I get inspiration from all places - I like to write little catchphrases and spin them around, or take a phrase I've heard from somewhere and work a song into what I think it means or what connotations it could have. For instance, I saw a non-attributed quote 'You can't get to heaven if you're raised in hell' and loved it - so I've started writing lyrics for the new album based around that idea"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Hey, what is the best 2014 deathcore album for you (excluding No Hope, No Morality)? Cheers from the Czech Republic!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","the best album for me in 2014 is a tough one, but I'd go with Upon A Burning Body - The World Is My Enemy Now. I didn't like it so much on the first listen, but I listen to it almost daily now!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Awesome. Someone will be along to sticky this post ASAP. Is the rest of the band not joining you?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Unfortunately not, they're all either at work or otherwise engaged so its just little old me!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Alright then. I was going to ask your percussionist how he works with the foundation of your music. With such an obvious hardcore influence it must be a challenge for him to keep everything harmonious with the brutal shit you and your guitarists deliver."
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Richard is very instrumental (pun intended) in the writing of all our songs - he's gifted with keeping feel in his drums, and has a big influence on how riffs play out tonally and the structures of songs which allows him to balance being brutal as hell and having a little bit of hardcore groove in there too!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","That's good to hear. His balance of those elements is some of the best in the hardcore-deathcore style IMO. On a different note, I was wondering what it was like for you to feature on Black Tongue's ""Coma"". It's one of my favourite features of all time. Was there a lot of pressure for you to keep up with Alex's sheer vocal ridiculousness?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","I'm glad you like it dude! Thank you so much for the kind words.

Honestly, I was really trying my hardest to divide opinion on that guest spot. I know a lot of people would wanna hear me try and do the most disgusting gutturals and really try to out-heavy myself - but I didn't think that suited the song. They gave me complete free reign to do what I liked on that section, so I decided that I wanted to do something outrageous, something really catchy and something that would stand out from the song but complement it in its own way. So I started off with that hype section, made it ignorant as fuck then moved on to tearing the track up!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Thanks for the insight. It really shows that your presence in the song is very genuine in that regard. The fact that you're both small-town UK bands really adds to the heart and soul of that song."
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","favorite band you've played/toured with ? "
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","My most favourite band musically would have to be Postmortem Promises way back in 2010. I have loved that band since they started, and I had to watch them play every song every single night.

Personally, either Thy Art Is Murder or Boris The Blade. We seem to get on really well with aussie bands! It was TAIMs first euro headline tour when we supported them, and it was my 23rd birthday whilst we were away. They made the whole evening really special, bought me a cake and everything. Great guys."
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","[how about my entire collection? haha](http://imgur.com/9hVZHmh)"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","oh mate thank you so much! you don't know how much it means!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","just realised i posted this on the wrong comment thread woops haha.

no worries man, been following you guys since 09! &lt;3"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Being someone from Lincolnshire myself (Spalding/fenland to be precise), was it hard to break out of the area, or did you get out of Lincolnshire as soon as possible?
Also - I thought No Hope No Morality was one of the best albums of the year (seen here: http://www.crashdoubt.co.uk/2014/12/crash-doubt-staff-picks-2015/) - great job dudes!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Ah a Spalding lad! Nowt but rough lads and cabbages that way, right?

We had a big base of friends who happened to be promoters in our early days, so that helped a lot with getting recognised in other cities. Being a promoter helps a lot though - you make friends in other cities, they help you out and you help them out when you can. it works!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Well more cabbages than rough dudes these days.
Good to have some insight on what helps young bands get around and out of places with the most terrible scenes going.
(PS - your Peterborough show with Acrania was of the fucking chain!)"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Thanks dude! "
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Hey Matt, big fan of Martyr Defiled, you have been amazing both times I have seen you live. I have two questions. 
 - Any chance of a headline UK tour this year?
 - Are you going to see 36 Crazyfists in Nottingham? 
Thanks, keep making good music!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Man, I wish I could go see 36CF again - they're one of my favourites from when I was younger. And its on my birthday as well! As it is, my girlfriend has arranged some cute shit that I really can't say no to.

I don't know if we'll be doing a headliner this year - it all depends on how we get on with writing MD3. We don't wanna rush it, so if its done in time - we'll be out there touring and supporting it!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Should hit them up in London Glenny ;)"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Might do man, shall check it out"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Ive been wondering for a while are you guys and AOAA still ignorant to Christ? Just kidding my real question is what band would you bring back that have decided to call it quits?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","hahaha fucks sake. who knows what happened there!

I'd love to see a Dreaming In Oceans album. They never got past a 5 song EP and it pains me every time"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","This is not a dig at your guys at all, fucking love your music and merch.

I've bought most of your merch BUT I haven't since around Feb of last year as no matter what temp I washed my clothes at they seemed to shrink pretty badly. Have you guys changed 'jumper' provider since thats what I usually bought from you guy?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","What particular brand of jumper were they printed on? We usually use Gildan, which are pretty standard for band merch.. if not, send us an email to md.bigcartel@gmail.com and we'll see if we have any spares we can replace them with!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","How do you react to the fan reception of your Lamb of god's cover? I love the song, just wanted to see your opinion on it.
Killer show in Portugal btw!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Honestly? We did it for ourselves, cos we love the song and it was a whole lot of fun. If our fans dig it then great - but it was never put out to get a reaction. I'm glad you like it though brother! It means a lot.

Which show did you come to in Portugal? That tour was CRAZY"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Lisbon show, my favourite gig of the night.
Hope you come back sometime!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","What up mang, cheers from Halifax, Canada.
What's your guilty pleasure band?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Yo! Hopefully we'll get to see you soon!

I'm just not guilty about any of the really poppy stuff I listen to, but I have to admit I'm a huge t-swift fan. I love her tunes man!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Is Dave in the band or out? Just curious because your most recent album is incredible and it would be a bummer if he left since he wrote it"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Ahhh, Dave Trees isn't in MD any more - he left to pursue a teaching career that didn't marry up with the time off we needed him to take.

With regards to album writing, we all write most stuff! Ryan in particular has written a large majority of the songs on NHNM. Which are your favourite songs? I can tell you who (mostly) wrote them!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Obviously I wasn't the one who asked the question but my favourite songs are Demons in the Mist (sorry for picking that as it's the lead track) and I really liked No Hope as well. Do you all write a large portion of your own parts for each song or does one member usually piece together a song then the rest of you sort of flesh it out?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","DITM and No Hope are very much Ryan songs!

We tend to do it the second way - one member will put a song together then we'll all have our input and it'll grow from there."
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Hey Matt. I just started getting into you guys. Demons in the Mist is one of my top 5 metal songs now. Fucking sick stuff. I was wondering what method of support gives you guys the biggest share of the money? iTunes, shirts from you guys, physical CDs, or something else? Keep doing what you do bro. Support from the States! "
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Ah thanks man, and welcome to the MDMAFIA!

Shirts from our merch stores are the biggest share of cash to us - we've tried to have local stores where our biggest fanbases are, so we have a aussie merch store, a US merch store and a UK/Euro one!

"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Why no In Shadows live anymore? :("
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","we're pushing the new stuff man! On support tours, you wanna play your newest material cos its the most relevant to people who haven't heard you before. If we did a headline set we'd definitely play some old stuff!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Saw you guys and heard you for the first time at Face Down in the Scala last year at 2am when I was pissed as fuck and I remember having my mind blown by you guys so thanks for that!

My question is I'm a Director/Editor based in London and I'm doing Music Videos, but I want to be doing alternative/metalcore/deathcore and I'm doing anything but that these days! What do you reckon is the best way of getting gigs doing videos for you guys/others like you?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Ah man, that was definitely an experience. Did you see those crazy guys in the main room with the 3 foot mullets?

Your best way forward is to get a really strong portfolio together and approach bands you wanna work with! We got involved with Zak Pinchin that way - we'd seen a load of his work before, he got in touch and asked if we were looking for any work and he did the Demons video for us, which in turn got him a bunch more work"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Hey matt, long time super fan own a shit load of shirts and up until recently I owned a snapback but fuck who cares, met you a few times in London and Derby and just wanted to say you're a proper decent guy it's been a pleasure to speak to you every time, and just wanted to ask what happened to dave? "
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Hey dude! I'm sure it was a pleasure to speak to you too - I'm terrible with names, but I never forget a face

Dave left to become a teacher! His time off in the school hols didn't work with touring so he had to pick one or the other, which is a shame. I still talk to him all the time, he's a don on Destiny so we're always on PS4 together."
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","ah that's great ton hear, I used to play a lot of blops2 with him he's a bit of a FPs Head aye :], safe anyways just wanna end it off by saying keep it up glad to see you guys are making it to the USA after so long you deserve it when you and lorna shore gonna tour the UK? ;D"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Haha hopefully Lorna Shore get over here very soon! Thanks for the support dude, we all appreciate it so much. Long live the MDMAFIA!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Thanks for doing this. No Hope No Morality was my favourite deathcore realease of this year, and one of my favourite albuns of the year. 616 was probably my most played track haha


Album of the year for you? Doesn't need to be deathcore obviously.
And favourite mainstream UK rock/metal band?  


Looking at Martyr Defiled's fb page looks like you're hitting America with The Last Ten Seconds of Life, (btw their new album sounds sweet) good luck with that, and next time you visit Portugal, don't forget to play a show in Oporto pls "
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Ah thanks man, its great to hear you enjoyed it so much!

Album of the year for me is probably LP1 by FKA Twigs. I'm so into this future soul sound at the moment, I love it! My favourite mainstream UK rock/metal band is Bring Me The Horizon, I love their new album and I love Drown.

We might be announcing an american tour soon ;) Yeah we wanna come back to Portugal so bad! I love your country, we had an amazing time last summer"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","&gt;My favourite mainstream UK rock/metal band is Bring Me The Horizon, I love their new album and I love Drown.

I'm glad you said that. I love them, but it seems like a lot of people here in /r/deathcore shit on them since they've moved so far away from deathcore. Sempiternal is fantastic and if their new album is even half as good it'll be one of the best of the year."
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","[deleted]"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Sempiternal came out early 2013 and they just recently put out Drown"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Hey man! huge fan,you absolutely killed it in cardiff with black tongue and at download,and I can't wait to see you again! But,if you could only listen to 3 albums and watch 3 films for the rest of your life,what would they be?
"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Thanks dude! Great to hear from you, thanks for watching us at download especially.

3 albums:

Frank Ocean - Channel Orange /
Deftones - White Pony /

"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Burritos!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Oh man, I love those too!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","how do you have your burrito? what meat?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","The meat is like half pig and half cow (no idea how you call that in English honestly haha). And they somehow look like this: http://i.imgur.com/wQE1q2y.png

"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Any advice you can give to gigging bands to take that next step in their career?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Show swap, play for nothing, and never give any less than 100% into your shows no matter how many people are watching you.

Its always the shows with the least people that ending up meaning the most. We once played a show in Vienna, Austria to 5 people - we could have mugged the show off and not tried, but we thought fuck it we're gonna give it our all. Every time we go back to Vienna, those same 5 guys are there with 5, 10, 15 friends. And they come back with more friends. We know one of them so well, we've watched him find his wife and have his first child - he was only 17 when we first met him!

tl;dr - give 100% every time because you never know how much it will benefit you"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Thanks so much dude!
Anything you can say for online promotion? I noticed the video you did on your facebook 'when the breakdown hits and you with your boys' and I thought it was a class idea for promotion."
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Yeah little viral videos are ace to make up, but you have to do it sparingly. You don't wanna be known as the band that drops their track on every viral video ever, but its also good to have a bit of fun now and again"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Few questions here: Hope you don't mind!
Favourite rappers?
Do you like any music in the charts/radio 1 music?
What's your drink of choice on a night out?
Any tattoo's you regret?
Ever been arrested?
Any uk clothing lines you're loving right now?

Thanks dude!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","No worries mate, thanks for getting involved!

Favourite rappers: Action Bronson, Joey Badass, Kendrick Lamar, Biggie!

Chart Music: Man I love all of it. I'm a sucker for a catchy song!

Never been arrested! 

UK clothing lines: SABBC every day man! I also really like Represent.

"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Hi Matt, big fan of your band! Seen you various times at Ghostfest! I was just wondering if your bassist still works at Topman in Lincoln? I had a slightly cringe moment there with him on time... Haha"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Thanks man, great to hear from you!

Haha no, he doesn't! I work at Vodafone in the waterside though ;)"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Ahh nice! I don't go to Lincoln as much as I used to anymore... But keep up the good work and hopefully you guys will get big enough so you can leave Vodafone! "
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","will the 'step off the boks son'' sweater ever be reprinted? "
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","We'll reprint anything if theres enough demand for it bro!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","What's up Matt? Three questions.

1. Which UK metal/hardcore bands inspired you to start up MD? I think I heard you talk about a Dreaming in Oceans tattoo once. 

2. What's the prisoner about on the art for No Hope No Morality?

3. Which do you think is Martyr Defiled's heaviest song?



"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Hey dude!

1. Yeah I do have a DIO tattoo - they were around after we started though. If I had to name 3 bands it would be Postmortem Promises, The Argent Dawn and Eternal Lord pre-Ed Butcher. I listened to those bands a lot in 2007, just before MD came together.

2. The whole concept for NHNM is that if you can't get to heaven because you are born with original sin and can never be free of that, why would you try to be a good person when being a good person is never going to be enough? So the prisoner on the front cover is a representation of all the shit that we deal with in our lives, and the bag over his head is his blindness or apathy to whats going on around him.

3. I think the ending of LVCIFER is the heaviest thing we've ever done. Every time we drop it live it makes me wanna punch someone in the face. I love it!
"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Awesome. Old Eternal Lord slays. Love the concept for the album. "
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Just wanted to say that the into for No Morality is the sickest intro in this genre of music. Fucking rock on."
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Thanks bro, glad you like it!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Hey Matt, good to see you on here! I met you in Munich at Backstage last time you played in the summer when I was with my asian buddy you know from back home haha. Any plans to come back here this summer?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Ah man great to hear from you again! How's wen doing?

Hopefully we'll get a couple DE shows but its looking more likely we'll do a proper EU run next autumn. That can all change though, its never set"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Ah thats awesome! We'll definitely come again, as long as you play Infidels this time ;) 

Wen is doing great now and is visiting his fam in China right now with his british wifey he met back in the UK. Cheers man and good luck with the next steps!"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Favourite welsh fan? (come on we both know the answer here)"

"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","What was the deal with Attack Attack slagging you off, and the Your Demise thing?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Honestly, no idea with AA! The YD thing was just a rip, they took it personally, we ironed it out between us and its all love now."
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","You gonna be playing ghostfest/announcing a UK tour any time soon?"

"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","I genuinely have no idea about how to develop the techniques people are doing these days, like vocal fry and false chord stuff - but there are loads of great youtube videos out there with loads of advice and help for you, so watch them and get practising!

One thing I will say is that you'll never get your voice to sound exactly like someone else's - it took me a long time to embrace the sound of my own vocals rather than trying to make them sound like Alex Erian or Mitch Lucker."
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","How are the guys from infant annihilator/black tongue? "
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Best dudes! Very different as real people though, they're quiet and reserved guys rather than the mad internet personalities that you would expect from them"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Send me to hell cuz I don't give a fuck. Best line in death core? "
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Do you feel more comfortable with your vocals now compared to your earlier stuff? How do you do your guttural vocals?"
"Matthew Jones, vocalist and founding member for UK deathcore/metalcore band Martyr Defiled here - AMA!","Yeah loads more comfortable now. I feel like I've grown into my range a lot more, which I think means I sound a lot more like me now rather than me trying to sound like someone else.

Gutturals are all about the mouth position and diaphragm control for me. I've been learning to do the false chord thing with your cheeks with some ace results, I'm excited to record again and try out some new shit!"

I don't know why people would say Vibrant Vibrance isn't deathcore.  Sure, it doesn't have a strict breakdown, but...  There're plenty of other common deathcore elements there.  Breakowns aren't the end-all-be-all of deathcore, or music.  Plus, it's not like it matters.  The song rocks, everything else is just trying to explain why.

"What's the opinion on the new Chelsea Grin album? Especially Alex's vocals.","Vox are pretty great, instrumentals are fantastic thanks to Mr. Richardson.

The lyrics though. They are god-awful, full of cringe in so many ways. That's my only complaint about the album, really."
"What's the opinion on the new Chelsea Grin album? Especially Alex's vocals.","Pretty much this. I just think they're trying to keep appealing to the younger crowd. "
"What's the opinion on the new Chelsea Grin album? Especially Alex's vocals.","On the first discussion someone said he thought 2/3 of the lyrics were garbage and I think that's a good way to put it.

"What's the opinion on the new Chelsea Grin album? Especially Alex's vocals.","I think it's their best album. It's pretty melodic, and the instruments sound a lot better than they did on Desolation of Eden. I also like Alex's vocals a whole lot more here than on Desolation of Eden as well, where they kind of sounded like a congested Donald Duck. Of the eight Deathcore albums I've listened to this year, it's number five. And it's probably top 25 out of all of the albums I've heard this year. "

"What's the opinion on the new Chelsea Grin album? Especially Alex's vocals.","I thought playing with fire was a cool song. Couldn't get into the rest of the album though. I always valued instrumentals over lyrics, so they didn't really bother me."
"What's the opinion on the new Chelsea Grin album? Especially Alex's vocals.","I like it a lot as a whole and Alex's vocals sound way better than I think anyone expected, but there are some really awful songs on here."
"What's the opinion on the new Chelsea Grin album? Especially Alex's vocals.","Well seeing as Don't Ask, Don't Tell (Some Bring Me The Horizon shit) is by far their most popular song I am so grateful they didn't pursue the metalcorey-sceney money grab genre that the song so subtly rode on. This album (whether or not a good one) was a step away from that and back where they shine. Some song are just plain great chelsea songs, some are alright but hard to get into, and some are just a bit weak sounding.. they don't have that signature flair. 
Now his vocals have improved quite a lot, but unfortunately we don't get to see that disgusting self-titled EP low vocal style that drew me into  this band originally. That being said, the vocals do hit well and pack a big punch. The sound is there and is solid. His voice has improved by a million.
Do I love this album? It's alright, and It's sure as hell a chelsea album. I can't help but miss the pure simplicity of the EP (Maybe nostalgia speaking). The band as a whole sounds a fuckton better here than they ever have. My only gripe would be the occasional metalcore feel of evolve that seeps in here and there. If I could dictate their next album style I hope they can continue to steer from the metalcore scene, and improve on the powerful vocals and technical skill playing. It sounds so much better than strumming the same drop chord 20 times in a row.
They never cease to add something special in each album so whatever they do next, I'm sure It'll be brutal. Or half of it will."
"What's the opinion on the new Chelsea Grin album? Especially Alex's vocals.","This is absolutely my go-to album right now. I just can't get it out of my head.  I'm a little biased though, as I'm still in the honeymoon stage with this album, but it's sofa king good I can't stand it. "

"What tuning to play in?","So I've had my 7 string for awhile now, and I seem to have fallen into a sirt of rut lately, I'm at that odd point where you just added another string and cant play a damn thing. I wanna know what tuning to go to so I can get a more metal sound because right now I'm at the basic standard tuning on a 7 string. Any tips?"
"What tuning to play in?","just tune the B down as low as possible, and the low E to G and youre in business

seriously though, ADADGBE"
"What tuning to play in?","Drop Double E.
Two Octaves."
"What tuning to play in?","Drop the B string to A (one full step down) and start chugging. Drop A on a seven string never fails."
"What tuning to play in?","That is what everyone keeps saying, must be true haha "
"What tuning to play in?","Haha, I guess there's some truth to it! I find that drop A gives you a lot of options with both brutality and dark riffing. Shure you can do the same style in every tuning but I think that having a low and heavy A at the bottom of your range gives so much power. Drop G is also a nice tuning if you want to take things lower. "
"What tuning to play in?","Triple drop L# dude only way to be brutal.

In all seriousness, there are so many different tunings you can use for deathcore, especially with a 7 string. 

Drop E works great for really djenty stuff, provided you have the means to get the right tone for it. It's much easier to use on an 8 string though, as it doesn't cut off the range so much with that extra top string. Bands like Galactic Pegasus and Delusions of Grandeur use this tuning quite often.

Drop F# is my personal favourite for getting that tight, but gritty sound for killer riffs and slams. Bands like Infant Annihilator play in this tuning, and it's great for 7 strings playing anything from deathcore to doom metal. 

But you're probably better off going for something like Drop A, if you're just playing straight-up deathcore tunes, or the classic Drop G# if you want to be able to get pretty brutal with it."
"What tuning to play in?","Thanks I'll give it a try, I thought about buying an 8 string but I didnt even know what to do with 7 so I'll work my way up haha "
"What tuning to play in?","I use a six string. Tune to C sharp. Heavy yet somehow ""different"". Once I started playing on it I couldn't stop. "
"What tuning to play in?","Yea thats is what I have my six string in but I just got bored needed something heavier "

"Lucas Mann is a Ditto","One time, in a galaxy far ago, there lived a Ditto. He was the only Ditto in the Ditto World that liked deathcore, and since he couldn't afford to record everything himself, he decided to tear apart the fabric of the universe, crawl through the cavernous cavity that was left by the incision, and emerge through the flesh of space and time into our own dimensional plane. While exploring this new land, the Ditto overheard a young Lucas Mann practicing with his new band, Rings Of Saturn. After listening in on song after song of unrelenting breakdowns and a cascade of machine-like guitar wankery that can only be described as the sound of two cyborg-alien moss piglets fucking to [this song.](http://youtu.be/ygI-2F8ApUM)

Only that song in particular. Nothing else.

The Ditto thought Lucas Mann was trying to kill him and devour his soul, because Rings of Saturn is all like, aliens 'n shit...So out of fear for his life he inhaled Lucas Mann and transformed himself into a complete replica of his physical form.

Because this particular Ditto is also part Kirby, and *those inhales.*

Since then, this Ditto has been impersonating Lucas Mann and operating as the guitarist of Rings of Saturn. 

Due to recent allegations made by the former guitarist Joel something, it has become a common subject of debate amongst people in the deathcore community, many of whom believe that Lucas Mann 'fakes it', and relies on digital audio programs and MIDI controllers to produce the sound of his guitar work, instead of actually playing it. There have also been claims made that Lucas Mann *does* legitimately record his own guitar, but does so literally note by note, and pressures other members of the band to match his recording process in the same fashion. Although, I feel like that would take a ridiculously long time, and I can't imagine being able to flesh out such an outstanding record as their newest album, entitled Kugal Jet Li or some shit, with that kind of recording process.

But when it comes down to it, the negative press surrounding Lucas Mann isn't really even about him. It's about the Ditto. The Ditto that has been living his life in his place for nearly a decade.

I know this must be some rather shocking information for you to hear, and I do, myself empathise. It was a surprising discovery to those who discovered it, and we urge you to think clearly and rationally about the subject at hand. Lucas Mann is actually a Ditto, and it has now become imperative that this knowledge be made public.

For those of you who may have your doubts, we understand, it *is* rather unbelievable. For you, and for those who don't know who Lucas Mann is or what a Ditto is, here is a side-by-side comparison of them.

"I really like the intensity of this genre, heavy/death/black metal/core etc., but it seems like these genres are saturated by bands with really good lyricists/vocalists and terrible instrumentalists, what do you guys think?","What I mean by ""terrible instrumentalists"" is that the more songs I listen to, the more I see the same repetitive patterns within the music; really hard guitar riff and drum solo, followed by a lull where the singer belts out a few lines, followed by the same sounds, with areas in between where things might speed up a bit while the vocalist goes screamo-style. 

Now I'm not saying I'm sick of it, I mean I like it as much as the next guy, it's part of what defines the genre, but I feel like there's room for more innovation within the songs. I realize that it'd be unrealistic to expect every track of every band to be an innovative masterpiece where the instrumentalists develop a string of wholly unique sounds, but take out the killer vocals from 90% of the tracks you hear and I'm confident you'll see what I'm talking about. One sound repeated over and over, with little to no progression and only subtle deviations between samples. Are there artists who break the mold, bands whose members really devote themselves to producing unique sounds throughout their songs? 

An analogue to what I'm talking about would be how ""minimalism"" style tracks are, and although that ambient sub-genre is worlds apart from what deathcore intends to be, I feel like the concept behind that style of music would be great to see in heavy/death metal. 

But I digress, what are your thoughts on the topic?"
"I really like the intensity of this genre, heavy/death/black metal/core etc., but it seems like these genres are saturated by bands with really good lyricists/vocalists and terrible instrumentalists, what do you guys think?","I feel the opposite way actually, I think that too often I will love a band's instrumentals but the vocals turn me off so much I can't make it through one track"
"I really like the intensity of this genre, heavy/death/black metal/core etc., but it seems like these genres are saturated by bands with really good lyricists/vocalists and terrible instrumentalists, what do you guys think?","I can agree with that too, but sometimes I find the lyrics to be redeeming enough to forgive some bad vocals. It does get on my nerves as much though most of the time."

And I think a lot of the reason for the simplistic song structure is because deathcore is a derivative of hardcore, which usually has a pretty simple song structure."

"I really like the intensity of this genre, heavy/death/black metal/core etc., but it seems like these genres are saturated by bands with really good lyricists/vocalists and terrible instrumentalists, what do you guys think?","I liked the way the instruments were used in all of those. But I know what you mean, I just find myself wishing that there was a genre where the music had really complex structure, orchestral vocalists (essentially ethereal wave music), but with the intensity of metal and the killer beats found in hip-hop and rap. I've yet to find it but deathcore definitely has the passion I like to hear from the singers. I just find the vocals to be really hit and miss when it comes to songs with good instrumentalists, sometimes they're mind-numbing and nothing more than guttural shrieks or screaming that I can barely understand, other times they're legible and sound awesome but without the speedy delivery or the impressive lyrics you find in rap. Conversely, I find myself listening to rap, the rapper lays down some sick lines, but the music is boring and the beat is all synth'd instead of made with real instruments. Didn't mean to rant, the 2nd and 4th videos were awesome though, the rest I couldn't really understand the words, thanks for the recommendations!"
"I really like the intensity of this genre, heavy/death/black metal/core etc., but it seems like these genres are saturated by bands with really good lyricists/vocalists and terrible instrumentalists, what do you guys think?","^couldnt really understand the wordsThat's like 75% of the genres vocals"
"I really like the intensity of this genre, heavy/death/black metal/core etc., but it seems like these genres are saturated by bands with really good lyricists/vocalists and terrible instrumentalists, what do you guys think?","You can check out my band [Windy City Slaughter](http://youtu.be/_Wd6bcH9ywo).  We're a deathcore band, but I definitely feel we break the mold in a lot of ways.

I agree that there are many in the genre who are stuck emulating bands they listen to, instead of really having a voice and expressing it through their music.  I think this is why a lot of people hate on deathcore - because there are tons of bad deathcore bands.  However, I think there  more than a few bands that give deathcore a solid name."

&gt; lololol so underrated"
"Chelsea Grin - ""Everlasting Sleep"" (This album kicked ass in some many levels, so underrated)","First thing I thought too. Chelsea grin was rocketed into fame with this album and they are arguably one of the most well known deathcore bands"
"Chelsea Grin - ""Everlasting Sleep"" (This album kicked ass in some many levels, so underrated)","Right? A song from this album gets posted here at least once a day, so saying that either this *specific*  album, or the band themselves, are underrated is just plain malarkey."
"Chelsea Grin - ""Everlasting Sleep"" (This album kicked ass in some many levels, so underrated)","I thought it was 'Recreant' and latter Don't Ask Don't Tell that did that.


Just like I said in the other post, people give them shit for their new stuff with Jason (i actually like it, but not as much as this) and look back to DoE and their EP as their good ol' days and completely ignore this album, that's mainly the reason i think it's a bit underrated. Being underrated doesn't mean they need to have below 10k likes on facebook."
"Chelsea Grin - ""Everlasting Sleep"" (This album kicked ass in some many levels, so underrated)","This specific album, not the band"

"Chelsea Grin - ""Everlasting Sleep"" (This album kicked ass in some many levels, so underrated)","Hey not my words, I agree"
"Chelsea Grin - ""Everlasting Sleep"" (This album kicked ass in some many levels, so underrated)","By far their best album, then it went downhill. "
"Chelsea Grin - ""Everlasting Sleep"" (This album kicked ass in some many levels, so underrated)","People always look at Desolation of Eden or even their shitty EP as their glory days, but I always looked this album as their best, and one of the best deathcore albuns ever. It had atmosphere and showed Alex's best performance (some people might not stand his highs, but i think they're pretty unique and very black metalish) which set them apart from everything else. With that being said, underrated=\=underground or not famous."
"Chelsea Grin - ""Everlasting Sleep"" (This album kicked ass in some many levels, so underrated)","Shitty EP???"

"Infant annihilator or Black Tongue?","I love both but I prefer Infant Annihilator because it's more raw, there's more emotion in the music (anger is still an emotion guys) and I love the grind and slam influences in IA. I can't wait for them to start releasing new music, even without Dan."

"Metal Wallpaper","OCEANO'S BACKGROUND IS A DIFFERENT SHADE AND IT REALLY BOTHERS ME."
"Metal Wallpaper","That's unlikely because I took all the logos, made their backgrounds transparent, and put them on a single, black background. Maybe I just can't see it on my computer, maybe you can show a screenshot?"

"Metal Wallpaper","Hey can you tell me how you made this? Id love to make one of my own"
"Metal Wallpaper","That question is very hard to answer.   
&amp;nbsp;  

Step 1: I either found pictures of logos via searching Google images, or I found them on the bands' Facebook pages or I'd have to cut them out from any picture with the logo on it like a tour picture or album cover.  

Step 2: I made all the logos white because I knew I wanted it on a black background. And then I gave the logos a transparent background.
  
Step 3: This is where most of the time is spent. I added a 1920x1080 black background, and then loaded all my logos into Photoshop and spent a few hours re-sizing and moving them around until they all fit together.  
&amp;nbsp;  


I can't teach you all the Photoshop skills for it, but I taught myself how to do all the stuff I know with the help of some searches and videos."

[Bring me the Horizon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfeNOJNQy0s)

[Bleed from Within](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY27BtVz3uE) (More melodic death metal, but these kind of vocals)"

[Angelmaker.](http://youtu.be/6dnRBwVUnmk) Your vocals are around the 1:40 mark, but that intro breakdown is too good to miss.

"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","I see. I actually am not too big a fan of new boo and cg. So poo. But if Jason is happy about it then I should be too. "
"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","Haha, I actually consider myself really fortunate.  I enjoy the Discovery, and previous Chelsea Grin was pretty good too, but I think they both just put out their best albums.  Most people seem to disagree!"
"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","I would strongly disagree haha. The Discovery is their masterpiece to me, whereas my favorite CG album is probably My Damnation."
"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","I dislike Chelsea Grin outright, so I have no qualms in saying that I want him to go back to playing and writing with Born of Osiris. Or even just release more of his solo stuff. That was similar enough to Born if Osiris for me."
"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","I think they don't like each other though since the boo guys kicked him out like assholes"
"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","Pretty sure it was because they all smoke weed and Jason was ragging on them about partying and shit."
"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","Yeah I guess he was like ""guys let's get to work and not be high all day"" and they got pissed. Since we don't really know details, as of now I'm on Jason's side."
"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","Which is fair. I'm not really on anyone's side. The way they executed things was shady, but I can understand being annoyed when someone asks you to change your lifestyle. They've been doing things the same way for years, and for him to come in and ask them to change the way things operate is a little shady as well."
"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","This guy needs a band that actually plays on his level."

"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","respectfully disagree, the discovery was a great album but he could be replaced the rest of the band with [this]( http://youtu.be/W3nPFkxxYno) and I wouldn't have noticed the difference."
"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","Nah man that sounds nothing like The Discovery. Some of the best things about it are more subtle, like the ambiance of songs, and the ...angelic(?) sort of voices in the background. Plus Cam is one of the best drummers playing right now."
"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","I'll give you that, the ambiance and the drums were pretty stellar but the vocals and rhythm work really killed the feel for me. Follow the signs and devastate are some of my favorite tracks but the never ending breakdown formula really undermines the lead work in my opinion.

That being said I still listen to the discovery from time to time, I can't stand Chelsea grin though."
"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","That's a fair criticism. As for CG, I'm really picky with them. I don't really like any full albums, but I probably like half the songs on all of them."

"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","There was another video where he played it the actual first time, this was the second lol sorta misleading title sorry, but yea in the first take right before this one shot at another angle, there were some douchebags watching looking unimpressed, another was on his phone half the time.

Couldn't have put it better myself.  This is some of the of the most dark/beautiful music out there.  

You're right: the listening curve for things like: growling, 1/32nd note kick drum triplets and distorted guitars, is very steep. That is - it takes some time for a new listener to acquire the vernacular that's needs to appreciate the harmony and the rhythm that's inside of this music. 

I.E I've played something like [""Planetary Duality Pt. I""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwyUq_0R_XE) for experienced musicians, and mostly, they can't even process what their hearing.  And/or have a bashful/defensive reaction to the growing and can't hear past it!  "

"Jason Richardson playing 'XIV/Behold' by Born of Osiris live for the first time at NAMM 2015","Or you could have just said what everyone else already has. ""I wish Jason was in Born of Osiris still."" 

I'm not trying to be a dick. I just thought it was interesting that people regarded The Discovery as ""old"" Born of Osiris. To me, old Born of Osiris is like, The New Reign and back."

"What do you think of the latest Acacia Strain single?","The guest vocals ruined it."
"What do you think of the latest Acacia Strain single?","The fact that TAS incorporates actual hardcore bands like Ringworm and Incendiary on their guest vocals and not bullshit like Jonathan Davis or Corey Taylor or some shit shows that they know their roots. The guest vocals give the song a great dynamic. Anyone who disagrees is obviously wrong and dumb. (downvotes ahoy!)"
"What do you think of the latest Acacia Strain single?","You're 100% correct. Think it sounds great and have been a fan since their start."
"What do you think of the latest Acacia Strain single?","People are saying that ""you people don't know a true hxc vocalist when you hear one""

Ok, but his voice just *doesn't fit*. 

Sure he may fucking kill it on his records and other guest appearances, but it just doesn't fit TAS's theme of just low, hard pounding sounds."

"What do you think of the latest Acacia Strain single?","Don't really like the song but I love the album name"

2) I really enjoyed them, thought they fit great. I will admit I am a big fan of Wake the Dead.

3) I think everything else is OK."
"What do you think of the latest Acacia Strain single?","I think this song was better than that other single they released, but this is still shaping up to be a rather sub-par album. Maybe it's because I've grown older and changed, but I certainly haven't enjoyed the direction TAS have gone since Wormwood (which was the last good album if you ask me)."

"Hester Prynne - Black Heart Market","They semi hung it up. They went quiet after the Goswell Divorce. Then they did a kickstarter and raised money for their new album which they released themselves. It was a great effort. After releasing the album, they went quiet again. Overall, I think the lead singer drives a lot of the direction for how active the band is (or this is the feel I get from their FB). He also seems like he has a hard life (I am speaking from pure speculation), but it seemed like he started getting passionate to a fault at the end. Anyway, my two cents. If you go to their FB, you can find a lot of what I am talking about. "
"Hester Prynne - Black Heart Market","They did a kickstarter and kind of ripped off a bunch of their fans, then they deleted comments of people calling them out on Facebook, and eventually deleted their entire page."
"Hester Prynne - Black Heart Market","Personally, The Goswell Divorce was much better, lyric and instrumental - wise, one of my all time favorite albums. Don't get me wrong, I love Black Heart Market, but I was expecting a more solid album. Some parts just lacked and seemed almost empty, whereas the Goswell Divorce was as solid as it gets."

"Its been 2 years since Mitch left us. In honor of Him i give you my favorite Suicide Silence song- Disengage","I heard this song in Rock Band for the first time, and fell in love. I still remember so clearly finding out Mitch had passed, I only listened to Suicide Silence the rest of the day to honor him and was surprisingly shaken up for a couple days afterward, considering I didn't think I was too big of a fan, but was so incredibly thankful I got to see him perform multiple times."

Job for a cowboy- Doom.
Annotations of an autopsy- Welcome to sludge city.
Thy art is murder- infinite death
Chelsea grin- Chelsea grin EP
Eat a helicopter- The pessimist

"New to Deathcore, recommendations welcome please!","Recommendations will all depend upon where you came from in the music genre.  I came from liekling hardcore first and then began getting into Death metal like Chuck Schuldiner.  

Therefore my entry to Deathcore was with Elysia, and Molotov solution and Animosity.

But eventully turned to more slam and tech, like Rings of Saturn and Ingested.

Deathcore is really special now as progressing to lots of new areas."

"Why 18+ concerts?","Hey, I have been wondering lately... why are some concerts restricted to 18+? What is the purpose of it and what is a common opinion on this – good or bad?

I mean I am from the Czech Republic and I have never seen any musical concert where underage people were forbidden to go to. It seems like it is not very common in other European countries as well. Usually on the internet I see these 18+ restriction in USA/Australia and especially for concerts of deathcore bands, but I have no idea whether is has got something to do with the genre or with the venue or something."
"Why 18+ concerts?","the 18+ shows are just the ones at bars/clubs"
"Why 18+ concerts?","only thing comming to my mind is because some venues are selling alcohol.. "
"Why 18+ concerts?","The sell of alcohol in this bars it´s the problem of the restricted and i would like to change to 16 years old because there a lot of less 18 that listening any type of music."
"Why 18+ concerts?","US here. Almost every venue I've been in has served alcohol and not been 18+. I've never even heard of this practice in the states. "
"Why 18+ concerts?","Well I am from Australia and Deathcore bands usually play a separate AA shows as well as 18+ ones . Its usually smaller rock bands, prog rock/metal, metal (genres apart from metalcore/hardcore/deathcore) that don't do all ages shows often. Not many underage people turn up if they do anyway. "
"Why 18+ concerts?","cuz kids fucking suck"
"Why 18+ concerts?","I would assume it has something to do with the nature of the vocals. Lot's of swearing/adult themes. If the albums of the bands have parental advisory warnings the venue might enforce 18+ rules. Mosh pits could also be dangerous, especially for younger, smaller people and the venues may want to avoid a lawsuit because a kid got hurt. And of course, many venues, especially smaller ones where these shows are usually held sell alcohol. However I have been to shows when i was under 18 where liquor was sold. Those are my thoughts anyway. The way I see it, if kids can go see shows where girls are wearing skimpy outfits, singing about wanting cock and guys are rapping about drugs and shooting people, why are metal shows given these restrictions often? Well, that's my two cents. \m/ Rock on."
"Why 18+ concerts?","So it is mostly the owner of the club who does not want to have problems with lawsuits, right? On the other hand owners of the venues and promoters of the concerts loose profit because of these restrictions. I think there are a lot of underaged fans of these genres.

Thanks for replies, it is interesting. I just could not imagine that happening in my country because famous metal bands usually play at decent places and also alcohol is no argument here because it is sold literally everywhere and nobody can forbid you to go somewhere just because of the fact that alcohol is sold there."
"Why 18+ concerts?","This is guy is completely wrong so don't listen to him. In the States if you want to sell alcohol at all ages shows most liability insurance policies will require you to purchase another specific kind of insurance policy, that is very expensive, to cover your venue if underage drinking (aka sale of alcohol to a minor) occurs and the venue is held liable. A lot of smaller venues and establishments that are primarily bars can't afford it or just don't care about that demographic as much. 

Source: I book shows."
"Why 18+ concerts?","metal shows tend to be at venues that double as night clubs I think that's more likely the reason for the age restrictions"
"Why 18+ concerts?","Could be in larger cities. I'm in a smaller one so the clubs here would never sell out a Deathcore Band. Hell, even BDM didn't sell out in a small place. I've been to a rave that didn't have an age restriction at a club and been to metal shows that did in a hall."

Also... Dubstep *is* electronic music- did you mean Deathcore mixed with other kinds of electronic music like trance/techno? Because that could be pretty cool too.

"Deathcore with open headphones?","I'm trying to upgrade my headphones and want to try out the open style of headphones, like the sennheiser hd 518 or 558. Will either of those be good for deathcore?"
"Deathcore with open headphones?","I listen to Deathcore on my Grado SR80i headphones. They're open backed and very good (highly recommended by audiophiles) for fast paced and heavy music. The bass response is very good, but not overpowering, and the trebel response is sparkly and tight (which is great for guitar solos and cymbals). I own a lot of headphones, most of which cost about double the price of my Grados, but my Grados are still my favourite pair. The only disadvantage is the comfort, which is not awful but not amazing either, the headphones can begin to itch your ears slightly after about 3 hours of listening. That's my opinion, although there are plenty of other great pairs of open headphones out there. "
"Deathcore with open headphones?","Thanks, I'll check those out"
"Deathcore with open headphones?","Swear by Audio Technica ath-m50x with any $150.00 + DAC. I posted a thread just like this, I was recommended this set up, went with it, and it really does sound incredible. It's also great for other genres. "
"Deathcore with open headphones?","I use Sennheiser HD558s. They're great, uber comfortable, good price, and they sound great."
"Deathcore with open headphones?","what's your budget?

I'm using the HD 650's and they're incredible, but they're about 350 bucks."
"Deathcore with open headphones?","I'm on a pretty low budget, I ended up ordering the hd 439. Probably not the greatest but will definitely still sound better than my apple EarPods "
"Deathcore with open headphones?","Don't get studio monitors, they are amazing but you will be disappointed if you'r just listening to music, get something with good bass and just know most deathcore doesn't have the best production quality so if your on good headphones now you might not notice much of a difference."
"Deathcore with open headphones?","Thanks!"
"Deathcore with open headphones?","??? bands have great production quality now days. Look at within the ruins "
"Deathcore with open headphones?","I don't know if it's the production quality or the inability I have with messing with EQ, but everything just sounds like shit in my car.  
Too much noise and the speakers can't handle it IMO. Voices are always drawn out"
"Deathcore with open headphones?","Yes... Compare the sound quality over time with bands like whitechapel, the acacia strain, I declare war, emmure, fit for an autopsy,  job for a cowboy, and not exactly deathcore but still relevant, volumes, periphery, veil of maya, born of osiris"

Symphony of Horror.

Horror.

*Horror...*

On second thought, not such a bad album title after all. I was just overthinking it. Truly, this album is fantastic, and while I am EXTREMELY biased on the grounds of black metal being my favourite kind of metal and also having been waiting for your full-length ever since I first heard your music like fucking MONTHS ago, I am confident in saying that you guys are on the path to something amazing. 

The production, which was my main issue with the previous bits I heard from you, has improved drastically and it's wonderful. It makes it sound so strikingly grandiose while still having a really raw, blackened edge to it. The thing I love the most about it, is that throughout so much of the album, it's like the music doesn't want you to know how you feel about it. Whenever a dark but beautiful melody swings by and leads into a chaotic and disjointed passage of epic riffs and (albiet a *slight* bit overly-programmed-sounding) blast beats, it's like being thrown into a whole other musical world again. It gives the sense of a very powerful compositional vision, and seeing how that translates into the production is really quite impressive.

The vocals have also gotten a lot better, or at least have found their place in the music perfectly. They lack a certain kind of depth, which takes away a bit from the deathcore aspects, but adds tenfold to the blackened atmosphere, and it definitely works out in their favour. My only criticism is that I think the vocals could do a better job of flowing *with* the melodies at times. They already compliment and contrast them where they should, and in quite an epic fashion, but I'd really like to hear them try to follow and harmonize with the guitar and keyboard melodies more. Kind of like how Into Infernus does it, or how early Dissection did. 

All things considered, amazing record. I'll likely be buying it soon, and definitely recommending it to whoever might be interested."
"(Check out my band) Blackened Deathcore, new album out now!","Thanks so much! I'm really glad people are liking it, we worked very hard on it and hearing people like you who praise it makes it all worthwhile. If/when you do buy it, i'll send you a free copy of Catacombs if you end up getting a physical (Just leave your username in a note at checkout). Thanks again man, keep it metal \m/"
"(Check out my band) Blackened Deathcore, new album out now!","I got the Catacombs EP some months back and really enjoyed it as I'm a sucker for the symphonic stuff.  This is no exception.  I like the fact that it actually sounds evil.  Lots of bands try to pull that off, but the way the production is it sounds like the real deal.  Definitely good stuff."

"Opinion on King 810","Title"
"Opinion on King 810","In my opinion, King 810 is one of the worst things to come out in a long time. Their 2edgy4u lyrics and appearance are cringe-worthy as hell, and their instrumentals are uninteresting and derivative. "
"Opinion on King 810","Some of the best talent in Michigan born from the late Ares Letum, the latter of which was incredibly ahead of their time in the music scene. That being said, their lifestyle has destroyed any chance of them making good music. Cult mentality with an enormous ego and a ridiculous victim complex. My old band played 3 shows with them. One was shut down after their set because they destroyed/stole other band's equipment. The other two involved throwing things at the crowd, police intervention/arrests, and tear gas. Fucking shithead pricks that don't deserve any recognition past the fact that they were once talented musicians. "

They annoy the fuck out of me. "
"Opinion on King 810","I do not like them. "
"Opinion on King 810","I'll say that I tried!  I think they have some really good songs.  ""Fat Around the Heart"" and ""Kill them all"" are just really solid, heavy jams.  The rest of their album was kind of boring.

I think their lyrical content starts off as potent, then ends up being redundant.  It's refreshing that they kind of have something different to sing about, but I think they take the wrong angle.  Instead of lyrics about uplifting themselves and having a positive impact on the shitty city they came from, it's all about how they are part of the problem.

Really solid production on their album though.  Josh Schroeder rips it up and captured a very raw and aggressive sound.

If they came around with another band I liked, I wouldn't skip their set, but they're not a group I'd go out of my way for."

"Do you guys think Thy Art is Murder would be as successful as they are now if their original vocalist never left?","Most likely yes, given that a good chunk of their success early on was because of the publicitiy Infinite Death got, but CJ is a fucking beast and the way they've progressed I think was entirely necessary for them to be the band they are today."
"Do you guys think Thy Art is Murder would be as successful as they are now if their original vocalist never left?","Infinite Death is still better than anything they currently have imo. 
I miss the old vocalist. 
For one e.p. it was insane i couldnt wait for more, i messaged the band a looooong time ago why they got a new vocalist, they replied with CJ ""can actually perform live so yeahh""
This was back on myspace. "
"Do you guys think Thy Art is Murder would be as successful as they are now if their original vocalist never left?","Maybe. Don't get me wrong, I think Infinite Death is awesome, but I kinda prefer Hate for a number of reasons."
"Do you guys think Thy Art is Murder would be as successful as they are now if their original vocalist never left?","but if they kept their old vocalist and progressed to be some crazy band they might end up be similar to boris the blade (or they could of ended up staying just a small local band, I personally think they would of become huge anyway) 
**TL; DR - could have gone either way, CJ is killer live though**"
"Do you guys think Thy Art is Murder would be as successful as they are now if their original vocalist never left?","I actually like CJ better, I think his voice fits better with the music. I like Infinite Death a lot but Hate is truly a better album. Everything is a lot more mature, which I don't think would've happened if CJ didn't join. "
"Do you guys think Thy Art is Murder would be as successful as they are now if their original vocalist never left?","The difference of hate also was contributed by their lead guitarist leaving before it too. "
"Do you guys think Thy Art is Murder would be as successful as they are now if their original vocalist never left?","no way, cj brings everything to the table, from vocals to business. "
"Do you guys think Thy Art is Murder would be as successful as they are now if their original vocalist never left?","Nope, his heart wasnt in it (I know Brenddogs)"
"Do you guys think Thy Art is Murder would be as successful as they are now if their original vocalist never left?","Can you tell me the real reason he left the band? I've been listening to this band for years, and after he left I stopped listening to them until I heard reign of darkness. Their first album with cj wasn't the best. Hate is one of my top 5 albums now though. "
"Do you guys think Thy Art is Murder would be as successful as they are now if their original vocalist never left?","I think more successful imo. CJ's vocals still fit the band perfectly though."
"Do you guys think Thy Art is Murder would be as successful as they are now if their original vocalist never left?","I think they would have been more successful. All of infinite death was insane."

[Thy Art is Murder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vtaROWZt1U) is also around the mid-to-fast range and absolutely rips. Same with [Fit For an Autopsy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEfPPa8T8gU).

On the more technical side of things you'll find [The Red Shore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsnc9ugrbw0), [The Schoenberg Automaton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udrQbohjKE8) (a personal favorite of mine), [Beneath the Massacre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUOZRcocoFI), and [Rings of Saturn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkG9Y6it-MA), the last of which you might or might not like.


If you look for synths, things to look for would be [Born of Osiris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wraoECk6hss), [Make Them Suffer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKe4Z9mmyVk), [Ovid's Withering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfoXYpR4PXI), and [Xehanort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiXlN32CnI).


If you like the sound of older deathcore you might like [Point Below Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_dsiCq3Osk), [Through the Eyes of the Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUoq1CQtT0Q), [Molotov Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDUDj4KRHDg), [Despised Icon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laXxoLGhwiw), [Martyr Defiled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkUqYD8L4Ng), and [The Red Chord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV5DRaqrMuo).


Personal root for [My Bitter End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-rEHK3sJEo)."

My guess is you'll enjoy stuff like Thy Art Is Murder, As Blood Runs Black, Chelsea Grin, The Acacia Strain, Oceano, Carnifex, I Declare War, Born of Osiris, Aversions Crown, AngelMaker, A Night In Texas, Lorna Shore. "

"Oceano - Dawn of Descent (NEW SINGLE 2015)","better than Dead Planet. This hits SO hard. fuck. "
"Oceano - Dawn of Descent (NEW SINGLE 2015)","sooooooooooo sickkkkk"
"Oceano - Dawn of Descent (NEW SINGLE 2015)","Fuck... this hit me right in the nostalgia"
"Oceano - Dawn of Descent (NEW SINGLE 2015)","It's good to see they are not changing there style, and doing clean vocals like most of these deathcore bands."
"Oceano - Dawn of Descent (NEW SINGLE 2015)","That was quite good."
"Oceano - Dawn of Descent (NEW SINGLE 2015)","Damn. I've never listened to these guys before, I might have to fix that now. 

The drum sound is great. "
"Oceano - Dawn of Descent (NEW SINGLE 2015)","Their first 2 albums are great. Incisions had a somewhat poor production quality and its kind of experimental, so not a whole lot of people like it. But depths and contagion are fantastic."
"Oceano - Dawn of Descent (NEW SINGLE 2015)","When you say Incisions had ""poor production quality"" what do you mean by poor? Like it's actually bad? Or is it lo fi or something? "
"Oceano - Dawn of Descent (NEW SINGLE 2015)","One thing I loved about the first two was the power behind the bass drum and guitar. It was loud, and awesome. Incisions? It sounds like someone turned down the bass down completely. It sounds off. I liked incisions, but it always bothered me. "
"Oceano - Dawn of Descent (NEW SINGLE 2015)","I just listened to a track from Incisions (Incisions) and one from Depths (District of Misery). I think the production on Incisions was better actually, but i can hear what you're saying about the drum. It does have more power on Depths. 

The closer it sounds to Carnifex's [first album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVOsc0hEES0) or The Agony Scene's [second album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1wDLVJDFUk) the better imo. "

"Spotify notification release","We need a spotify notification release, for example traitors is now on there, is it usually a week after main cd release ?"
"Spotify notification release","Usually for the bands I listen to, they show up on the same day as their release date, but it took about a week for A Night In Texas' recent release to show up"
"Spotify notification release","Well the thing is, it is usually the label or the distributor that releases albums for the bands in different music streaming sources. Doing so takes usually about a week, if the band has a spotify account. But there is no certain time, honestly."
"Spotify notification release","The time it takes for an album to appear on Spotify really varies. Slipknot's 5th album was put on there the same night as the release, but I've seen other albums take in excess of a week to turn up. Sometimes the band or the label will release an official album stream prior to the actual release date, via Youtube, Soundcloud, Music Glue or another platform, which is usually the best way to listen to a new album on (or before) the CD release date. "

What is your absolute favorite song? ~~No fence sitting, no this or that,~~ or whole albums. Can be cross-genres as long as it's still mainly considered deathcore.

I'll go first:  

Entombment of a Machine - Job for a Cowboy

or

Recreant - Chelsea Grin






edit: I guess nobody knows what ""No fence sitting, no this or that"" means, but whatever. I guess post your top two."

-----------------------------

your vision of a new life was impure

gave into temptation and threw away what you believed

your immaculate state of mind was only temporary

your faults, your flaws got the best of you

your commitment, your pledge do another human being

was destroyed thru curiousity

your goal in life is far out of reach

you'll find your self out of luuuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkk

Not only was he a nice dude, he was funny, and treated us like regular people.  I was only about 15-16 at the time, but he treated me and my buddy like friends. Not many people would have been so welcoming to a couple of teenagers. It wasn't even till later on that I realized how cool it was of him to do that. I have so much respect for him outside of him being one/the best frontmans that started the deathcore genre.  "

"What are the words to the opening monolog for Acacia Strain's new album Coma Witch?","The beginning of the song starts with a poem by Aleister Crowley named ""The Poet.""  Here is the full poem by him:  


Bury me in an nameless grave!  
I came from god the world to save.  
I brought them wisdom from above:  
Worship, and Liberty, and Love.  
They slew me for I did disparage  
Therefore Religion, Law, and Marriage.  
So be my grave without a name  
That earth may swallow up my shame! 

[Here is the Wiki article on him to give you a general idea of the man who wrote the poem.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley)

"Thoughts on the new Emmure album?","I personally find it awful and a poor example of the subgenre. The music is predictable, the transitions are not totally bad, an the vocals feel cheap. Don't even get me started on some of the lyrics.

5/10, but that's just my opinion, what do you guys think?"
"Thoughts on the new Emmure album?","Ok. I used to ride the ""Emmure fucking sucks"" train too. Sure, a couple of their songs were passable, but as a deathcore band I gave them zero respect. After seeing them this past week with the Acacia Strain (who were fucking incredible btw) I have to say, Emmure is definitely a HUGE guilty pleasure of mine. Their stage presence is great and Frankie is a decent ass frontman if you can put up with the ""I think i'm a rapper"" bullshit. They aren't meant to be taken completely seriously or do anything groundbreaking. They're just a bunch of angry white dudes who are just a bit more.... urban... than the average deathcore fan. But rant aside, I'd say it's a solid album, nothing spectacular."
"Thoughts on the new Emmure album?","First deathcore concert I'm attending Acacia/Emmure this weekend, first concert in a while, don't know what I'm expecting!"

"Thoughts on the new Emmure album?","I didn't even know they were touring together.  I still can't believe that given their beef all those years ago.  It just seems odd."
"Thoughts on the new Emmure album?","I didn't even know they were releasing a new album, like, I've literally heard nothing about it. How does that happen?

That being said, Emmure has never been something I listen to for lyrics, and I didn't really care for the last album. The last time I enjoyed an Emmure release was Felony, not sure what it is about that album, but its always fun to jam out to."
"Thoughts on the new Emmure album?","That's because *Eternal Enemies* came out on April 15th. They toured just before its release with Thy Art Is Murder, Volumes, and Gideon. I never liked Emmure but I enjoyed their live performance on this tour. I decided I would check out their new album when it dropped and it only reminded me why I didn't like them to begin with. There is nothing to be excited about on that album."
"Thoughts on the new Emmure album?","The song with the school shootings just annoyed me, it's just Frankie trying to be edgy and get people talking. He'll deny it and say that it's some artistic bullshit, but fuck him."

I'm talking like the JFAC doom ep, see you next tuesday, elysia, Animosity, Suicide Silence(the cleansing album), Molotov Solution, and Despised Icon shit like that."
"Does anyone else miss old deathcore?","Not really, most of my favourite albums are from 2006-10 but right now we have bands like Angelmaker, A Night In Texas, Slice The Cake, Ingested, Ovid's Withering, Shadow of the Colossus, Nexilva, Martyr Defiled, I, Valiance, Aversions Crown, Lorna Shore putting out better quality music than any of the old guard did, deathcore at the moment is by far the most diverse core genre and it's only getting better."
"Does anyone else miss old deathcore?","I hated deathcore until around 2010 (excluding Infinite Death, The Somatic Defilement, and Fused Together In Revolving Doors). It was boring, chuggy and lacked versatility."
"Does anyone else miss old deathcore?","yeah I miss old deathcore. ABRB's album Allegiance will forever be my favorite deathcore album. I do like a lot of newer stuff though. I didn't like 2010-2012 deathcore. I felt like the 2010-2012 stuff was where deathcore started trying to diversify but most of it was all prototypical and mediocre.. now we're experiencing the fruits of that movement though. 

It has become an extremely diverse genre recently. When stuff like Within The Ruins, Ovid's Withering, Rings of Saturn, and Thy Art Is Murder all fall under the same overarching genre you know it has grown and matured a lot and im quite excited to see where it will be even 5 years from now. It honestly baffles me that the majority of more traditional ""metalheads"" think deathcore is all generic and boring, no talent required, and not even metal lol."
"Does anyone else miss old deathcore?","definitely miss all the mathcore and all the crazy fun deathcore.

i love modern deathcore. but i miss when bands didn't give a fuck and just did silly shit all the time. (see you next tuesday, arsonists get all the girls, tony danza, horse the band, heavyheavylowlow, duck duck goose, ect)

even though it felt like they didn't take themselves seriously at all, their music was the bees knees. it was fun to listen to. still is. the shows were the shit. just insanity. "
"Does anyone else miss old deathcore?","[deleted]"
"Does anyone else miss old deathcore?","Honestly, no. After bands like Whitechapel and Carnifex got popular, it became a massive fad. I can't praise an era that caused me to bear witness to Attila. I think that now, though, deathcore has variety and each band has an identity."
"Does anyone else miss old deathcore?","I miss Somatic Defilement"
"Does anyone else miss old deathcore?","Not even a little bit. 06-08 death core is like an annoying kid brother that won't stop banging on your bedroom door, and stealing your fucking Nintendo to play with its shitty friend.

I guess you guys don't understand similes. I was using the ""banging door"" as a comparison to how the bass drum was always too loud and muddy in the mix. The Nintendo thing was a simile for the obnoxious ""iwrestledabearonce"" style of songwriting.

"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","As the title says: Younger people of this subreddit, could you explain to me how you’ve found your musical way into listening to Deathcore bands? What kind of bands have you listened before entering this type of music? What was the path you took?

The reason why I ask is pure interest: Yesterday, I’ve been to a show of Suicide Silence and Thy Art is Murder and I’ve seen a lot of younger fans (I myself am 26 years old). In one of the breaks in between the bands playing, the DJ played a Korn song, and I suddenly remembered some of the bands I listened to in my teens and how my music taste changed over the years and how one band led to another.


Here’s my story as a comparison: Everything started with Korn: My older cousin gave me “Follow the leader” as a birthday present when I became 12 years old. After a lot of New Metal bands I went on to Iced Earth, Metallica, Sodom, Exedus, and so on, right before discovering growls and screams with Dimmu Borgir, Death, Behemoth and many others (popular Black Metal led to Death Metal). After that I was always looking for more extreme stuff and finished my first journey in the Metal Scene with Slam Death Metal such as Devourment and Crepitation. At this time, the Metalcore scene grew bigger and bigger in Europe and I appreciated the breeze of fresh air in the classic Metal scene, which I personally found to be very conservative and superficial after I outgrew from puberty. After a few years listening to other stuff than Metal, I started again by listening to some Hardcore, Metalcore and Deathcore; for me, Deathcore being a nice mix between my past and the newer stuff.

I guess that I entered the Deathcore genre by coming from more classic ways of Extreme Metal. Is it different for younger people these days? I am very interested in your stories!
"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","my dad always listened to rock in the car and I really liked metallica, korn, staind, disturbed, etc. when I was little and when I was in highschool my buddy had the devil wears prada on his ipod and let me listen to it.(swords dragons and diet coke..still remember) thought it was weird at first but then hearing the breakdowns I fukin loved it. Started listening to bands like them, then gravitated to more ""brutal"" stuff, found Rose Funeral and Carnifex and thats what really got me in the genre. 

Now I'm more into death metal, really love the old school bands like Baphomet, Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, etc. "
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Very similar for me, my dad always listened to pantera, metallica, rob zombie, etc so I just kinda naturally gravitated to stuff like that. the first CD I ever bought was Toxicity by System of a Down and I loved it. Listened to linkin park and loved their screamed vocals and started finding things with more and more screaming until finding metalcore/deathcore, stuff like that."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Is your dad now interested in your stuff? In our family van we always listened to music my brother and I wanted to hear. So my mom had to endure some Cannibal Corpse while riding to the mountains."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Sort of, but not as much as I'd like. I showed him August Burns Red's new christmas song ([it's so cool haha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH9f3CacSjI#t=30)) and he lol'd when the vocals came in, but he definitely wouldn't listen on his own. closest he's gotten is probably avenged sevenfold, he really likes them. But yeah, my family has had to listen to a lot that I'm sure they hated."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Haha, this song *is* funny! Nice breakdown though.

I suggest you expose him to a lot growls and screams till he starts to like it, similarly like we ""grew"" into our music taste ;-)"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Haha, awesome! Brings back some memories, too! I can totally relate to the ""gravitating towards more brutal stuff"": Often I found myself looking for something even more extreme (I guess I stopped at Crepitation [http://youtu.be/d6cd8uhFe7E])
I like how you're looking for the roots of your bands, like Cannibal Corpse and Suffocation. Long time favorites of mine, too. Then i discovered the new stuff which arrived from the USA. So just the other way around than you."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Grew up to bands like 311, Modest Mouse, Falling Up, etc. 
In middle school, I played guitar guitar hero and heard songs like Six, Prequel to the Sequel, and that always appealed to me for some reason. 

Pretty self explanatory from there, started researching, going to shows, socializing with other metalheads, etc. "
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","I never thought about the Guitar Hero part of your story!"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","I'm really into System of a Down. Slipknot used to be the more ""hardcore"" stuff for me. 
I've discovered Carnifex by messing around on Youtube at the beginning of the year when they release [Dragged into the Grave.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1hafyakGXE) The ending part was a blast, so well written. 

Die Without Hope is my albums of the year, actually, one of my favorite album ever. I've listened to all Carnifex album, but unfortunately, none sounds like their newest (don't get me wrong, some of their oldest sounds are outstanding, Dead But Dreaming, Hell Chose me, Hope Dies With The Decadent), but none of them sounds as good as Die Without Hope in my opinion. "
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Carnifex seems to be a way more important band that I thought it to be."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Carnifex was the reason i started writing songs and wanting to be a vocalist. That never happened (yet) but it was the one band that i connected to the most when listening /reading thier lyrics (emotional love stuff) so they will always be one of my favorite bands."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","[deleted]"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Carry on with your aim to be a vocalist, man! Get yourself a little setup and a small room to practice, and later some nice dudes to play great music with. My brother practiced for almost 2 years but set it aside after he lost interest because it got boring to just scream for himself. I still think it's a shame he never sang in a band."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","I guess I did what most kids do these days. I was introduced to a pop-metalcore-ish band through a runescape friend (yes, it was those days) and I started listening to it because I liked it a lot. I listened to metalcore for many years, and got to know of Chelsea Grin, Suicide Silence and Whitechapel through youtube comments and videos. Started listening to it, and I never looked back! Now 6 years later, deathcore is the genre of music I listen to the most, but my taste has grown into more of the underground bands who incorporate a lot of brutal death metal and slam elements into their music, opposed to for example, ironically enough: Chelsea Grin, Suicide Silence and Whitechapel who took their music in a more commercial direction."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","It's funny how Youtube was, and maybe still is, a platform for many young bands.

Could you maybe name a few bands you're listening to at the moment? It sounds like something I would enjoy, too.
"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Been listening to a lot of Acrania, Vulvodynia, Beyond Deviation (some of the nastiest high's in deathcore I tell ye), Cage of Torment (norway represent) and some I Declare War (yes, they have some slam stuff in some of their songs). Those are what I remember from the top of my head."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Heavy stuff! Seems like you went from pop-ish stuff to quiet extreme stuff. I conclude that younger people still start with lighter metal stuff and try to experience new sounds by going to extremer sounds and vocals.

I really enjoyed Cage of Torment. And Acrania seems to have havesome lyrics. Thanks for the suggestions!"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","When I was younger one day I got bored of green day after they released a bad album. Prior to that I literally ONLY listened to green day.

A friend recommended me slipknot, and linked the music video to sulfur. I really liked it so listened to skipknot and other nu metal bands for a while (such as SoaD). Also listened to some disturbed. I thought I was such a metal head and that I listened to really heavy shit. 

A few months later I decided to listen to some of the metal classics, such as iron maiden. After listening to some older stuff like that for a while, I discovered power metal. I listened to straight power metal for at least a year, I loved it way more than slipknot/SoaD/disturbed. After a while power metal started getting a bit old but I still loved it.

At the time, I was a huge league of legends fan, and one day when I was browsing the league forums I stumbled upon a thread asking what song you are currently listened to. I clicked a random link and stumbled upon [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oqPrB7NPdo). This is what started my journey into extreme metal.

I torrented the album and listened to it for a while. It was the only album with that ""crazy screaming/growling shit"" that I actually enjoyed. I kind of hovered between this album and power metal for a while... I was actually ashamed that I was listening to stuff with screaming haha... I thought ""i don't want to be one of *those* people"" (whatever that means).

Eventually I got over that phase and realized that I really did enjoy the vocals on this album. I tried to learn more about this type of music - it was a mix of electronic stuff and something called ""metalcore"". I did more research on metalcore and eventually started listening to more of it. I grew very tolerant of harsh vocals after a while, and eventually I realized I liked it better than cleans.

I eventually stumbled upon deathcore, death metal, and all the other extreme metal genres. 

And here I am today.. ive given up metalcore. Mostly listen to deathcore and slam death metal. I had phases of black metal/death metal, but I find that I like deathcore/slam the most.

"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","&gt; I grew very tolerant of harsh vocals after a while, and eventually I realized I liked it better than cleans.

"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","I don't know if I count as younger (21) but I found the genre because of rateyourmusic. I saw the genre was related to metalcore and looked at [the list of all of the deathcore albums](https://rateyourmusic.com/customchart?page=1&amp;chart_type=top&amp;type=album&amp;year=alltime&amp;genre_include=1&amp;genres=Deathcore&amp;include_child_genres=t&amp;include=both&amp;limit=none&amp;countries=) just looking at all the different album art, and liked the one for [Dominion](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/one_more_victim/dominion/) by One More Victim and decided to check it out. Before that I'd known about deathcore, but really didn't want to listen to any of it because I wasn't interested in metal  (and the pig squeals were a huge turn off). I ended up liking the album and came here to ask for some suggestions, burned through those in a couple of weeks and got tired of deathcore. A little while later though I heard that Carnifex had a new album out and said ""fuck it why not get into Carnifex?"" and decided to marathon their discography. I actually really liked it.

I'm still not as familiar with the genre as I'd like to be though.  "
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","What led you to listening Metalcore? (I am assuming you were/are listening to Metalcore because you mentioned this connection on rateyourmusic.) What were you listening before ""Extreme Music""?

And how do you differentiate between Metalcore and Metal (you said that you were not interested in Metal). Where do you draw the line? Are you interested in the big bands of ""classic"" metal or not at all?"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","&gt;What led you to listening Metalcore?

There's a show I watch that has a fairly large fan base, enough so that it has it's own little music ""scene"" and a couple of online radio stations. One of the songs I heard on the station was some energetic guitar work with a mix of clean + harsh vocals. I was also watching a youtuber called theneedledrop around the same time, and he put out a video reviewing Sempiternal by Bring Me the Horizon, I like the one fan song a lot and said ""both of these are metalcore right?"" and checked out the genre. 

&gt;What were you listening before ""Extreme Music""?

Fan music of a show I watch, psychedelic trance (Infected Mushroom, Astral Projection, 1200 Micrograms, Shpongle, Hallucinogen, the Distance to Goa compilations), brostep (Skrillex, Excision, Knife Party, Bassnectar), and the occasional hip hop album (Run the Jewels, Lost in Space/Black Elvis, Dr. Octagon, Operation Doomsday, Czarface, Critical Beatdown, A Piece of Strange). I did have a few token metal albums I was listening to, Come My Fanatics by Electric Wizard, Meir and the s/t by Kvelertak, White 1 by Sunn O))), and pretty much everything Machinae Supremacy put out. 

 &gt;And how do you differentiate between Metalcore and Metal

I'm not wholly sure on that. Honestly I just think of metalcore as melodeath with choruses and the occasional breakdown or chug. 

&gt;Where do you draw the line?

I really don't at this point. I've pretty much gotten over my whole metal""phobia"" for the most part. 

&gt;Are you interested in the big bands of ""classic"" metal or not at all?

I'm interested in getting into as many genres as I can at the moment. So at some point, if by classic you're talking about like Iron Maiden (I've listened to them twice) and other 70's/80's bands. But not right now. I'm trying to get into death metal right now, especially melodic death metal, especially a small backlog of stuff from this year that I need to get through in the next couple of weeks. But at some point absolutely. "
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","This was very interesting to read, thank you! I quickly listened to Machinae Supremacy and found a link I was looking for in my post: I never heard this kind of music before (although it sometimes remembers me of Dragonforce) and I guess it may bridge the gap between more popular genres and things like Deathcore. A bridge I never heard before.

I once was at the point as you are right now: I was really interested in the roots of ""my music"" and tried all the old bands, reaching back to Black Sabbath. But I think it isn't condemnable if one doesn't like everything from the past, just because it influenced your favorite band. I never got into Iron Maiden, for example. Or Judas Priest.

I tried hard to find a suggestion, which will slowly bring you into Death Metal. Try Dying Fetus. Although Dying Fetus is fast and brutal, they often have somehow groovy parts, to which you may will connect. Try their cover album ""History repeats"" for easy access ;-)"

Well both do play power metal, so it would make sense.

Something like that, (at least that's why I've checked out At the Gates and In Flames). But it's not just metal genres that I'm interested in. 

&gt; But I think it isn't condemnable if one doesn't like everything from the past, just because it influenced your favorite band. 

Certainly. I haven't been a fan of what little beatdown hardcore I've heard. No one can expect to like everything out there.

My problem at this point isn't that I can't handle dm, I just have to explore it more. But I have a huge ass backlog of music to burn through (like ~700 albums) I don't have much time for it. I tend to listen to an album and then forget about it, but I'm keeping with the metal I like [here](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/amethyststar/favorite_albums__metal/). 

&gt;Try Dying Fetus. Although Dying Fetus is fast and brutal, they often have somehow groovy parts, to which you may will connect. Try their cover album ""History repeats"" for easy access ;-)

I'll give the album a listen sometime. I liked the Dying Fetus album I listened to a while ago. 
"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Well back in the day 10 years ago when I was like 12-13ish I listened to a decent amount of ""rock"" mostly pop-rock like Sum 41, Good Charlotte, Jimmy Eat World etc. I heard bands like Metallica, Guns n Roses, Megadeth etc. on the radio and liked them, but then my best friend showed me Underoath and I wanted more bands like that so I went on blanktv when it was a music video site and discovered mainly; Children of Bodom, Atreyu, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Haste the Day and Killswitch Engage. 

Needless to say when I started high school all my new friends I made listened to pretty much the same stuff and introduced me to a lot of new bands/genres. Although metalcore remained at the top, because of AILD, ATR, and HTD. My first ever concert was those 3 with Through the Eyes of the Dead! ;D Anyways since I was always looking for new bands to listen to this sounds kinda lame but around 2007-08 I look up ""best breakdown"" videos on youtube, and that's where I first heard Whitechapel - Vicer Exciser, Carnifex -Lie to My Face, Suicide Silence - No Pity For a Coward etc. And ever since been a huge deathcore fan."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","21 now, When I was around 14 I heard Whitechapel's This is Exile and instantly got hooked. Before that it was mostly Metallica, Slayer, etc.. i got into Death Metal after listening to Deathcore oddly enough."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","So just the other way around than me :-)"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","I'm 18, and in seventh grade I started listening to Flyleaf, which turned to BMTH's EP (I never liked anything else by them), then the first true deathcore I listened to was Chelsea Grin's Evolve EP a few years later. People hate on that but if it weren't for the cleans in Lilith and DADT, I probably wouldn't have grown to like deathcore today. My second deathcore band after CG ended up being Rings of Saturn, which I'm pretty proud about."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Damn, I just listened to Rings of Saturn (Dingir). I personally hear some Mathcore influences. Not easy to listen to."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","best breakdown videos on youtube to find new bands in maybe 07?
i was into rap then i liked limp bizkit then went onto like wrestling type nu metal bands then one of my friends took me too a taste of chaos show and i got into mosh hardcore. Around this time i just wanted to check out heaps of bands as i just got a ipod and need to fill it plus I liked the sound. By the time 2008 started i was into deathcore. "
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","This sounds like the kind of journey I was imagining for myself. Starting with Rap, going to New Metal stuff, advancing to Hardcore and searching for other styles with breakdowns. This path ""wasn't"" possible or this popular when I was younger. Thank you!"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","It's kinda hard to tell where exactly I found my way into deathcore. I've always been into rock and almost all types of metal and have always been looking for new bands to listen to. One day I was looking at some old The Black Dahlia Murder music on YouTube and saw Bring Me The Horizon in the recommended video list. I started listening to them and enjoyed it for a while, but nothing past their first album really seemed to compare. So once again I went back to YouTube and started checking out more recommended videos. Eventually I found something I really liked, the music video for Servants of Divinity by Bleed From Within. After that I wanted more music like this, so I did the unthinkable, I started reading YouTube comments and saw people recommending other bands, Thy Art is Murder's Infinite Death and As Blood Runs Black Allegiance were the most notable bands, I still listen to that ep/album every week. From that point I started listening to mostly deathcore and I mainly discover bands now from this subreddit,   different tours, and even YouTube recommended videos sometimes.  "
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","&gt; I started reading YouTube comments and saw people recommending other bands

Haha! :-D

I discovered As blood Runs Black through Youtube, too. Amazing how it got some bands really popular!"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","I suppose 18 is young (college freshman)...

I find myself to be pretty similar with the others. About 5th grade was when I actually discovered Green Day from a friend; which encouraged me to learn guitar. At that point, I was familiarized with all the classic rock bands because my dad always had rock on the radio and he jammed my iPod with 30 GB of it.

As I got better with guitar, I discovered AC/DC, and then learned all of their songs. I would even consider Metallica or Megadeth being really ""heavy"" then. I pretty much listened purely to AC/DC until about 8th grade when I really listened to Megadeth, Pantera, and the other classic metal bands. Also because my skill with guitar had progressed to this point as well. At some point I also became obsessed with Tool. I can accredit many of the bands I know to Pandora. 

Around 11th grade some random video had a part of a Gojira song in it. Then I fell in love with Gojira. Pandora introduced me to Meshuggah and I thought that was (still do) some brilliant shit. Looking back I would've thought this was the heaviest stuff out there in middle school.

Funny thing I was looking for a song called ""Carrion"" written for the new Call of Duty zombie mode and accidentally clicked on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhbyS1SuR7c](""Carrion"" by Parkway Drive). It was a really weird sound to me, but I actually couldn't believe that I didn't find the vocal styles unbearable. That's what led me to a few good bands in metalcore with the help of Pandora.

Somewhere I found Thy Art Is Murder and have been heavily focused on listening to Deathcore for the past year and a half or so.

Through the years, I can see my musical tastes changing and my interpretation of what is ""heavy"" kept getting pushed back by something better."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Awesome story, thanks for sharing! It seems like although you are a little bit younger you still took the same music path like a lot of my friends did: Getting obsessed with AC/DC and then looking for other great musicians in bands like Pantera and Tool."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Growing up, I never liked any music, mainly because my dad only listened to rap and my mom only listened to country and I couldn't get into those. When I was about ten, my friend gave me a mixtape for my birthday with bands like Linkin Park, Three Days Grace, and Papa Roach. I later discovered pop punk bands like Blink, Sum, and The Offspring. I gradually got into post-hardcore and metalcore and then, Mitch Lucker passed away and everyone was talking about it, and I discovered Suicide Silence, getting me into more deathcore bands "
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","I used to listen to Japanese bands like Dir En Grey, Maximum the Hormone, and even Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. I wanted to find English bands like the first two, so I found Asking Alexandria (Not close at all, but I used to like them). One night I was reading through YouTube comments one some AA music video, and I saw a comment about Acrania being better. I thought nobody could be better than AA, so I checked Acrania out. I then started liking deathcore. "
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","It all started in my junior high scene kid days, the classics like The Used, From Autumn To Ashes, Fall of Troy. Went to high school and kind of stopped listening to heavy music till my sophomore year heard Black Dahlia Murder and was instantly sucked back into heavy music, got really into death metal then heard whitechapel and slowly became tolerant of the breakdowns and gutterals. now I listen to mostly deathcore or hardcore."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","I went to my older cousins house few years ago and heard 'Bat Country' by Avenged Sevenfold because he was playing Guitar Hero. I looked them up at home, liked them and started listening to bands like SOAD, BVB and Slipknot.  
  
When I started buying music magazines it exposed me to different kinds of rock and metal and I slowly shifted from hard rock and popular metal to heavier stuff, but almost nothing with harsh vox still. A comment on an A7X video led me to DevilDriver (still love 'em!) and I really liked the song 'Clouds Over California'. From there, I began exploring groove metal, melodeath and death metal.  

Then I found deathcore a couple of years ago and fell in love with it. It helps that I made a friend on the deviantART forums who recommended me a lot of good stuff."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","I'm probably one of the younger people on this sub. 

I started with indie, still love indie (indie pop, indie rock, electronica). 

Then I heard Linkin Park (I know, I know) and that was the heaviest music I had heard, and I loved it. Then my friend in middle school introduced me to BMTH and I hated it because screaming. 

But I started listening to it more and more (listened to There Is A Hell like 50 times) and got hooked on AA and Of Mice and Men. 


From there I started listening to Count Your Blessings (BMTH has become one of my favorite bands) and then I was sold, and started listening to Emmure, Deafheaven, AGATG, and then I went down the rabbit hole thanks to you guys.


**TL;DR:** Austin Carlile saved my ~~life~~ music taste"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","My mother listend to GnR,Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Bon Jovi,Aerosmith and that kind of music. But at one point that started to be too soft i can say. I listned to some of asking alexandria and bullet for my valentine and some Slayer on the side. Later on I heard about Lamb of God and with Lamb, there was Pantera. But I was still wanting something stronger so my friend told me about Suicide Silence,Whitechappel and Thy Art is Murder. That's how i got hooked on deathcore. And I'm 15 btw
"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Awesome! Thank you."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","I started listening to bands like rise against, and harder rock like A7X. Led me to metalcore, and eventually here. Now I listen to deathcore exclusively. "
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Very interesting, thank you for your reply. So younger folks of today still still start with bands like Rise Against? How have you heard of them the first time?"
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Pandora. I started hearing some heavier bands. Like the newer asking alexandria. Then I started listening to the older stuff by them and thinking wow, I like the music but this screaming stuff sucks. I used to love cleans, and hate screams.. Now I hate cleans, and love screams. I eased my way into it."
"Young folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?","Yeah, it takes some time to getting used to the vocals, but once you're there you don't go back all too fast. My younger brother listened to Dimmu Borgir before me and it took me 3 months until I started liking the screams I heard through the walls."
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","I know most deathcore play tunings much lower but I was wondering if anyone knows of any bands playing in b. I don't want to tune any lower than that until I get a new guitar more suited for it."
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","The only band I know of of the top of my head is Through the Eyes of the Dead."
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","Oh man I'm gonna look up some tabs"
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","Veil of Maya. I think Elitist and Parkway Drive play in drop B but they aren't deathcore."
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","I've been learning some parkway slowly. Some of their riffs are pretty insane. I'll have to check elitist out. For some reason I've never heard veil either"
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","That last sentence made me sad :("
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","You gotta check out veil of maya. My all time favorite and they're guitar player is one of the most talented in my opinion. "
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","Wretched, The Crimson Armada, a couple Impending Doom songs, Depths of Hatred, Born of Osiris and some Chelsea Grin songs are in Drop B. Some are also in B Standard but it's not that difficult to tune another half step. Then you have the usual metalcore stuff that's in Drop C/C Standard."
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","Upvote for Wretched, although not completely Deathcore. Their songs are really fun to play"
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","Wretched is so good. And their vocalist is one of the nicest dudes I've ever had the pleasure of meeting"
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","All Shall Perish!"
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","I came here to say this!"

"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","That's the only album by them I like really I'll check into it"
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","Low C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1frGF31lIA"
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","Provisions by August Burns Red is in drop B. It's fun to play, especially the intro. Veil of Maya songs are fun, BMTH's first album isn't that great besides the solo, a lot of the riffs are kinda boring. "
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","He's already said that Parkway Drive is tricky for him. Veil of Maya would be really goddamn hard in that context. Born of Osiris's The New Reign was in drop B if I remember correctly. Not too crazy.

Other than that, Blind Witness played in drop B."
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","Yeah I'm getting there though which I'm pretty happy about, I stopped playing for 2 years and this is the most focused I've been when It comes to guitar. "
"Any good deathcore bands that play in drop b?","My band [Windy City Slaughter](http://youtu.be/_Wd6bcH9ywo) plays in drop B.  Our song [Aurora](http://youtu.be/DvQa089grG0?list=UU-GGbCAi-ufFmXApITBNxzw) is pretty easy!

Slipknot and I Killed the Prom Queen have a lot of stuff in drop B.  As mentioned, Veil of Maya and Parkway Drive are primarily Drop B."
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","Really liked their first 2 albums, so-so about Black Crown... Can't get into the new one.

What do you guys think?"
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","better than Black Crown, but not better than No Time to Bleed, The Cleansing, or anything Eddie did in All Shall Perish"
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","No disrespect to mitch at all, I think he was awesome.... But eddie has an insane range that I don't think most people can compete with, with that being said instrumentaly I feel like it's their weakest album, yet vocally their strongest. 
Except for some reason eddie changed his writing and tried too hard to make the lyrics fit suicide silence instead of just being himself "
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","It's very meh."
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","Its average...

Theres really no praise to be sung about it, its just boring. Fantastic as entry level stuff through"
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","Eddie's screams blew me away but for how anticipated the album was it could have been a little better lyrically and somewhat instrumentally. Still enjoy it though!"
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","Ehhhhh

It's alright but I never listen to it."
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","Something about the production that makes it a bit meh sounding, but i loved it, Control is one of my favourite jams of this year."
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","Only song I sorta like is blue haze "
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","Feel the same way. People always say Eddie has this huge range but the thing about Mitch was he could do those lows and highs and then have his clean schtick. I liked that his voice was very unique and he truly showed it in No Time to Bleed, Smoke is his best album vocally, probably. He did say it was favorite song off that album. "
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","Having never listened to them before I heard ""You Can't Stop Me"" (the song), I quite enjoy The Black Crown and You Can't Stop Me. By no means my favorite bands, but I can easily get groovin' to their stuff. "
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","I didn't get in to SS until after mitch died and for a while only liked Black Crown. I slowly started getting into the older stuff more, but I just can't get in to the newest one. I can't say it's bad, I just don't care much for it at all."
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","I thought The Cleansing was great and The Black Crown was okay. I never really listened to No Time to Bleed, but I really didn't like their newest album. "
"What do you guys think of the new Suicide Silence?","I always thought they were meh, the new album didn't change my mind.

Actually the only album of theirs that I really enjoyed a lot was the black crown. I love the production, the album art, and the overall sound of it "

"Chelsea Grin - ""Crewcabanger""","the selftitled song of my damnation is still my favorite song by them"
"Chelsea Grin - ""Crewcabanger""","I still really like that album, as Oblivion is one of my favorite songs, but I wasn't ready for a different sound moving away from their EP and whatnot. It was a little harder to feel the emotion in the newer albums for me."
"Chelsea Grin - ""Crewcabanger""","Man, the intro to the song desolation of eden will be ingrained in my memory forever. One long awesome blast beat."
"Chelsea Grin - ""Crewcabanger""","Im warming up to ""ashes to ashes"".

"Chelsea Grin - ""Crewcabanger""","I got into them by listening to their first EP and album, but to this day, My Damnation is still my favorite. I didn't like the vocals at first, but they grew on me, and as a vocalist myself, I really respect the unique sound Koehler possesses. Just the general quality of the album feels greater than their previous stuff. Lyrically, structurally, and musically I also like it better. But it's been nothing but downhill since then. "

"Deathcore with a lot of off-beat breakdowns?","Well I was going to suggest Lorna Shore...

Try After The Burial, The Raven Autarchy, and Delusions Of Grandeur. They've all got that kind of ""intrinsically djenty"" thing going on. Only problem is, none of them are anywhere near as heavy as Lorna Shore."
"Deathcore with a lot of off-beat breakdowns?","Im so excited for Lorna Shore's full length album they're releasing in 2015. They been recording it very recently according to their facebook page.

People also seem to forget that highs ≠ range. If you can go really high, but your ""lows"" sound like mids without any enunciation (a huge problem in Deathcore), you don't have range. Range is top to bottom, and the difference between Alex's lows and his highs are enormous."

Recently I've been thinking that it would be cool if there was some sort of 'History of Deathcore' explaining how the genre was created and evolved over time. 

Does anything like this exist already? If not, I'd like your help in naming the most important early Deathcore bands as well as some of their precursors. "

"History of Deathcore?","Heaven Shall Burn is Melodic Death Metal. They were never Deathcore."
"History of Deathcore?","They were easily one of the earliest, but with how ahead of their time they were I don't think they really had the fame when deathcore rose in popularity. They influenced all those early bands, but if you look at the their discography, The Ills of Modern Man was probably their most popular,  but they weren't they weren't the merch you saw at Hot Topic or FYE. They weren't the band myspace girls made signs for. I love them,  but the history of deathcore is complex.



I think it'd easier/interesting to see the history and influence of albums by doing some kind of ranking system for each year's top cds."

"Deathcore Suggestions?","Lately I've grown tired of my music collection. I listen to all kinds of metal, but I've been slowly moving towards heavier deathcore. I like simple songs, not overly progressive. Stuff with slow breakdowns. Really I'll listen to anything with a lot of heavy breakdowns. I've just been in that mood lately. As a basis, I like early Chelsea Grin, Whitechapel, Thy Art Is Murder, Aversions Crown, etc. I'm still relatively new to the genre, I grew up listening to metalcore. Again I love all forms of metal so any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks.

*EDIT: I should add that I have been drumming for about 10 years. Any bands with exceptional drumming is a bonus for me."
"Deathcore Suggestions?","If you like great drumming go listen to The Black Dahlia Murder"
"Deathcore Suggestions?","black tongue, the last ten seconds of life, sever the king, this is death valley (two vocalists, heavy as fuck)"
"Deathcore Suggestions?","So they can be considered either death metal or deathcore, whatever, but if you're looking for exceptional drumming, then try [The Faceless - Planetary Duality] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4axOfBW5CcU)"
"Deathcore Suggestions?","try [Rings of Saturn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgtUHHk30uc).  Its not super slow but everyone in the band has a lot of talent."
"Deathcore Suggestions?","Straightforward bad ass breakdowns I'd go with The Acacia Strain, Thy Art Is Murder, A Different Breed of Killer"

"The Acacia Strain Guide","So here is my Acacia Strain Guide.  I hope you all enjoy it as much as the All Shall Perish one.  Bit of a warning though.  It is a big read.  Let me know what you think.  
\m/

The Acacia Strain are a band that I have been an ardent fan of for a quite some time.  I first got “3750” and “The Dead Walk around 2006 for Christmas.  Those two albums were in any and all forms of my mp3/cd players for a good year or so.  I’d listen to other stuff but would revert to listening to those two albums.  I was hooked.  Both albums just had an unrivaled(to these ears) amount of anger and heaviness in them that just spoke to me in spades.  So since the All Shall Perish guide went over pretty well, it seemed pertinent to do one on The Acacia Strain.  Once again I’m going to focus on the studio albums.  The band has been through a few changes in sound over time.  
-**...And Life is Very Long** - You know, I really hated this album at first when I heard it many years back.  It sounded so damn generic.  It literally sounded like any metalcore band that was out at the time of it’s inception.  So it collected dust for a loooooonnnnnggggg time.  Until I started writing this guide.  However, you know what?  I can’t fault them for this.  Also, with fresh ears, it’s not nearly as bad as many made it out to be.  Even the band themselves.  The thing is, the band was young in this stage.  They were still looking for an identity.  So they grasped onto what a lot of typical metalcore was doing at this time.  Fast melodic riffs with some breakdowns.  However, listening to it today.  The breakdowns on this really are not bad at all.  They do get you wanting to mosh a bit.  Though with the pretty thin production of the day(most likely budgetary constraints, most bands starting out have to really work to get a good sound for less money.) that takes from some of the heaviness.  With the use of the breakdowns on this one though, one can tell how the band really wanted to go in future releases.  Not bad.  Not great though.  It was an early recording that’s worth a listen for historical purposes.  Also to appreciate where the band came from.      
**Top Tracks:**  Sloth Loves Chunk, Cable Ready Techno Slut, Killing on Empty    
-**3750** - So by this point the band had really changed their sound.  They went from typical metalcore of the era to a heavier, more mosh-fueled sound.  This is what I like to call the “moshcore” phase.  However they did mosh unlike any other metalcore band of that ilk from this period.  It was heavier.  It was downtuned lower.  The vocals were pretty much straight up death metal sounding(Not the first band to do this with moshy style core, others had done this, Examples:  Built Upon Frustration, Shattered Realm, Full Blown Chaos).  It was nasty, it was pissed, and just overall full of venom.  It didn’t quite have the more doom/sludge elements that they would later add in, but it could be heard to be forming in their sound.  They had three guitarists at this time.  Each trading off duties.  Though with the chuggy nature of their sound around this time, it was never utilized for more other than making it super goddamn heavy.  The misanthropy in Vincent’s lyrics really was coming out around this time.  But they were a little more obscure and less direct as they would later become.   
**Top Tracks:**  Brown Note, Smoke Ya Later, Sun Poison and Skin Cancer  
-**The Dead Walk** - This is the second album of the “moshcore” era.  This album was just pure sickness.  Everything about it was dialed up even higher.  They lost a guitarist and got a new drummer.  So they continued on as a five piece.  The sound this album was a lot more punchy and in your face.  Not to mention there was a lot more speed on this one as opposed to some of the plodding sections of 3750.  Make no mistake though, it was still heavy as hell.  Vincent’s lyrics really started to come into their own here.  He was angrier than before and the misanthropy was fully in swing here(“I have given up on you!.”  Brrrr gets me every time.).  Not to mention, some of the atmospheric guitar sections(like those little melodies in the background in their later albums) would develop more here.  For example in “As If Set Afire” about midway through one can pick out a melancholic bit of guitar work here.  A very nice touch indeed!!!  This is my favorite of this era of The Acacia Strain.  
**Top Tracks:**  As if Set Afire, Whoa! Shut It Down, Predator; Never Prey  
-**Continent** - So, to these ears, this was the first peak of The Acacia Strain.  They were going up the hill.  This album, this fucking album right here.  This was the morass of anger, hatred, and other negative emotions all put together.  This is the a first real mix of the doomier overtones of their later albums, and the hardcore/metalcore of the past three.  The album starts out with “Skynet” that starts out with a slowing to a crawl.  Then it just erupts into a speedier section that sets the tone for the whole album.  This is where the neat ambient additions in the guitar work came in full swing too.  Referencing “Skynet” once again, you hear the dive-bombing of the guitars.  Some wah-peddle work and other neat effects show up.  It just keeps getting better until the end.  The full-on speed assault of “Dr.  Doom” almost feels like a thrash song.  Not to mention this album had some neat solos that show up here and there.  By the time the it all starts nearing its end, we end up on “JFC.”  Holy shit.  It just smashes one in the face and never apologizes until it’s all over.  Then the whole thing ends off with the cathartic and pleasant instrumental in “The Behemoth.”  This album is what I like to call the “transition” - era.  When the doom was seeping in more into the band.  The next two albums would take full advantage of that.  The only real gripe I ever had with this album was that it had somewhat of a distant recording.  It was clear sounding and all of it can be heard well.  However, it feels as this should have more of an “in-your-face” recording.  
**Top Tracks**:  The whole damn thing.(Especially “Baby Buster” where Ringworm lead man Human Furnace throws in some vox.  Awesome.)  
-**Wormwood** - Cue the “doom” - era of The Acacia Strain.  So around this time, they came off their peak in “Continent.”  This was not nearly as good as that album, but was still a lot better than a lot of stuff.  I call this the “doom” - era because they were incorporating a lot more of the doomey/sludgy elements for this one and “Death is the Only Mortal.”  Immediately when listening to this album, one can make note of the tempo.  About eighty-some percent of the album is crawling at more of a mid-paced tempo.  Another big aspect of this album that seems noticeable, is that there are clear-cut chorus sections.  Not that it was a bad thing, but there were quite a few songs that got a bit repetitive when it came to these chorus sections.  This one and the next album don’t seem to be as well-loved as the bands other work.  The band had a majorly apocalyptic tone going on in this, “Continent”, and “Death is the Only Mortal”  Either way, there were some catchy, sing-along sections in this particular album(ending of “Jonestown” I want to yell it every time.)  Dare I say, this was quite a catchy album to these ears.  
Top tracks:  Jonestown, BTM FDR, Nightman(with awesome cameo from 100 Demons frontman Bruce Lepage.)  
-**Death is the Only Mortal** - This one seems to have not been as well-loved as the rest of The Acacia Strain’s discography.  That mid-tempo crawl that was present on “Wormwood” was still present here.  A lot of things that I noticed were said about this one is it was a more boring than their other work.  I disagreed with this.  This album did a better job at being more “doom-core”-ish than a lot of the downtempo bands that were springing up around the time this was released.  Not to mention, I felt it did way better than “Wormwood” on the doomey side of things.  It was dark and cavernous sounding.  The apocalyptic feeling of death everywhere was highly present.  By this point, the ambient guitar work(melodic work in the background) was pretty much a trademark of the band(not saying they started it, but they employed it a lot.).  Songs like “Brain Death”, “Victims of the Cave,” and “Doomblade” showcased just how fed up with the world this band was.  In the earlier work of the band, there was notable anger in what they were playing.  At this point, there is more of a strong disappointment with the world.  That confrontational slant that was abound on “Continent” was gone and in it’s place, a wishing for the end.  A peaceful falling to sleep for humanity.  Still, not the pinnacle of what they have done, but quite good overall.  
**Top Tracks:**  Doomblade, Brain Death, The Mouth of the River(dat beginning, whoa.)   
-**Coma Witch** - Okay, here it is.  To these ears this is the second peak of this band.  Here’s why.  Basically this album is a great marriage of the band of old around 3750/Dead Walk, Continent, and the latter two more doomey albums.  Here’s how, 1.  The production sounds a lot like how “The Dead Walk” sounded.  Very punchy with a bit of rawness.  They brought back a bit of that speedier hardcore feel they had around that time on this one.  2.  The overall tone of the album.  Now the overall tone of the album feels a lot like “Continent” did.  The hatred is there, along with the pure disappointment with humanity in general.  Now the band has had an overall doom/hateful tone for some time now.  But “Continent” I felt differentiated itself enough to be included in this description.   3.  The doomey-ness of the last few albums is still here.  This kind of goes in line with the tone, but the lyrics on this one have a very foreboding atmosphere to them.  A sense of dread, that we are on our way to extinction.  Also, special note needs to be made of the final song(or additional album if you want to call it that) “Observer.”  They took a cue from the band sleep, and made a long ass song.  A killer song it is!!!!  This one could easily put The Acacia Strain in with sludge bands like Eyehategod, Grief, and others.  Not to mention the samples included in it, that just really drive home the feeling of despair, hatred, disappointment, and overall negativity this album conveys(and I mean that as a compliment.)  To these ears, this peak of this band reaches a little bit higher than their former peak of Continent.  But we’re only talking millimeters here as both are two of the bands best.  
**Top Tracks:**  Observer, the whole damn album.  
So, this concludes my second guide.  This band has been one of my major favorites for a long time.  I’ve seen them live once and they just plain killed it on stage.  They kill it on their albums too.  Hope this guide is helpful!!!  Have a great day.

"The Acacia Strain Guide","I love just about all their stuff. Continent is still my favorite album though. I love every song on it.  Also, good guide!"
"The Acacia Strain Guide","Thanks.  Continent really is amazing.  Agreed totally."
"The Acacia Strain Guide","Definitely a good guide!  I wish I enjoyed Coma Witch as much as you.  I thought it was a good album, but something about it just didn't grab me.  I'm really excited to see what they come up with for their next album though.  I think it'll do them good to settle in with the new members."

"The Acacia Strain Guide","It's a fantastic album when your stoned. The tone just gets to you."
"The Acacia Strain Guide","I blaze to it all the time. As a matter of fact, I need to go do that right now"
"The Acacia Strain Guide","I like to run and listen to it. I remember running a race in moab Utah and being in the middle of nowhere, in the heat, listening to one of the later songs in the album (the most Mellow part of the album). It was almost out of body. "
"The Acacia Strain Guide","This is an awesome, well written description! Good job, dude!

 I've been pretty much out of deathcore for around 2 or so years now, but there's just something about The Acacia Strain's newer stuff that keeps me coming back. Wormwood got me listening to them again, and I kinda subconsciously took note of that doomy vibe, but I thought it was just the better production (in my opinion) that made it heavier. When they dropped Death is the Only Mortal, the first song I listened to was Brain Death. The first word that came to my mind after finishing that song was doom, and they do that shit WELL. They'll probably always be my jam when I'm pissed off."
"The Acacia Strain Guide","Much appreciated.  Death is the Only Mortal is a damn good listen for sure.
"
"The Acacia Strain Guide","Excellent guide, this is my favorite band. You ever hear their demo from 2001? They sound nothing like they do now obviously, but it's a pretty interesting listen. My favorites from it are [Strangled on Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy6e4UjeiE8) and [The Falling Song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kswzqdFYK4U)

I pretty much love everything these guys have done, even the EPs, singles, and splits."

"The Acacia Strain Guide","The Acacia Strain continues to be and always will be my favorite band. I've seen them several times now live, and they continue to impress."
"The Acacia Strain Guide","The Hills Have Eyes, off *Wormwood*, is mandatory for any work out playlist. Try driving at the speed limit when the intro comes in. Can't do it!"
"The Acacia Strain Guide","Always high quality guides, nice one Dspang."
"The Acacia Strain Guide","Thank you.  It's getting my ass back into writing.  "
"The Acacia Strain Guide","I really think *The Dead Walk* is the peak of Acacia Strain.  It is a **perfect** metal album IMO.  It is just crushing, it has technical grooves and amazingly crafted breakdowns.  The instrumentals are 100% there.  As far as vocals are concerned, Vincent kills it every. fucking. second. of the album.

Continent comes in second for me, and I love the album, but it doesn't come close to having the 'this album just doesn't fuck around' factor that Dead Walk does.

Coma Witch, I haven't listened to enough yet.  Gotta get some more plays in.  Some songs on the album kind of turn me off while others are pretty damn good.  Ever since Wormwood, I feel like the poor lyrics factor has been jumping up a bit (but thats just me)."
"The Acacia Strain Guide","you should also mention TAS live is also very damn good, Coma witch and The Dead Walk are so heavy and so good. Solid guide "
"The Acacia Strain Guide","I honestly love every single song TAS ever put out since 3750, I don't really like ...And Life Is Very Long at all, I consider it more of a demo than an actual album."
"The Acacia Strain Guide","You should add above and below,that was a sick ep. Great writeup. "
"The Acacia Strain Guide","I thought of doing that but decided against it because it always seemed their albums were where the large changes were made. I did consider doing a separate guide to their ep's, live recordings etc. Might do that if someone wants. "
"The Acacia Strain Guide","So who does everyone think I should do a guide for next? I like writing these.  "
"The Acacia Strain Guide","Well, you need to do something that seems relativly long/hard to get into. Personally, I've been wanting to get more into Job for a Cowboy. So thats my suggestion"
"The Acacia Strain Guide","A very good suggestion.  Hopefully the mods would be cool with it as their later work is more technical death metal than deathcore."
"The Acacia Strain Guide","can't wait ;)"
"The Acacia Strain Guide","One of the things i like most about TAS (aside from the music) is the artwork, especially Wormwood and Coma Witch."
"The Acacia Strain Guide","You know after I posted this, I was kind of beating myself up.  Because I should have made note of the fact that they have really neat and high quality artwork."

"Anyone bought from IndieMerchStore and know if they are reliable with their shipping?","I've never had any real issues and I've purchased a lot from them due to their selection versus what's available in my area. I had a few preorders that took a while with their shipping, received the item a day or so later then what I could have potentially got from going to a store but it arrived in great shape. Regular orders always came when expected with the option I picked. You can Google to see if they have any promos, they tend to have regular deals."

"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","Today was a great day for Deathcore [Rings of Saturn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6oSVDU_Tvg), [Sever the King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpPfwxsA6zA), [The Acacia Strain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5qnyrCec5w), and [Enterprise Earth](https://soundcloud.com/wearetriumphant/sets/enterprise-earth-23) all dropped albums. There are probably more, and please add the ones I missed.

- Which one do you like best and why? 

For me, it is very close between Sever the King and Rings of Saturn, but I would have to pick Rings of Saturn. Mainly because it sounds like space + heavy which is too good. Also, Enterprise Earth's first full CD should be epic. Some of these definitely AOTY potential. "
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","Coma Witch by far. I like what they did with the production and its just so. fucking. heavy. The ending breakdown for Send Help is just all kinds of nasty."
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","Fuck yes. I love the Acacia Strain because they are just ball to the fuckin walls heavy as shit. Nothing fancy just hate"
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","Exactly. Same with bands like Black Tongue. I hate reading YouTube comments about how ""this band is terrible. All it is is just one long breakdown."" Well no shit. Black tongue and The Acacia Strain were created with the sole purpose of being heavy as fuck. "
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","Rings of Saturn tends to get a lot of hate but personally I think it's gonna be REALLY hard to hate on Lugal Ki En. It's a masterpiece:^) new Acacia Strain is good but it just can't hold my attention the same way yknow"
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","They do get a lot of hate. I wouldn't say I hated them per se, but definitely did not listen to them prior to this. Knew about them, thought Embryonic Anomaly was sick, but still didn't listen to them often. More of a friend who doesn't listen to metal type shocker band. After hearing this, I was able to listen to their whole discography and appreciate it in a completely new light. "
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","If you asked me 1 month ago how I felt about RoS I would have said they're awful. But After listening to all their songs they are easily my favorite band at the moment. It's definitely different than what I usually listen to, but I love that shit."
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","Solid thread OP, I was aware of all but the Sever the King release (I've never heard of them before actually). I'm really digging the new RoS, but I'm giving Sever the King's album a listen and its sick."
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","I found out about the release last night. It was awesome. It reminded me of a toned down version of these guys — [Colossus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b91QFlURaKY). "
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","I'm gonna have to go with Lugal Ki En. It's beautiful."
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","Lugal Ki En is pretty excellent, but I've been listening to Coma Witch continuously for roughly 72 hours haha"
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","Personally, it was between TAS and ROS. I am giving a slight edge to The Acacia Strain because it held my attention a little better than Lugal Ki En."
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","How did it hold your attention better? I only ask because most people (I would assume) would argue that ROS' release had so much going on it held you listening to where TAS would be less melodic let's say and therefore more straight forward. Interested to hear what you think. Do you also like down tempo primarily in Deathcore? "
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","It just did, it's hard to explain but I feel that Coma Witch was more complete than Lugal Ki En (not to say it was a bad album at all, it is a really good album) but on the whole, I prefer TAS to ROS. I love down tempo in Deathcore but I don't know if I would say I primarily like down tempo, I love faster stuff too."
"Favorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)","Lugal Ki En was my introduction to Rings of Saturn, and I'm a fan now. I gotta go with that!"

"Question about programming drums!!","I was wondering if there is a plain step by step guide that is free and doesn't sound like shit. I really want to program drums because I can play bass and guitar and do vocals but I'm not sure the best way to incorporate drums as I can not have a drumset in my tiny apartment."
"Question about programming drums!!","Any program that can give you a midi output can be used, then you need to replace the (almost always really crappy) standard midi sounds with something half decent, which is a process I know basically nothing about. Sorry I couldn't be of more help, man."
"Question about programming drums!!","My guitarist programs all of the drums I actually play, I'm not sure how he does it, but he uses the program mixcraft. It's fairly simple I believe "
"Question about programming drums!!","I'm gunna check that out when I get off work. Any idea if its free?"
"Question about programming drums!!","Nahhh but you can torrent it lol. He got it off a friend that actually bought it. "
"Question about programming drums!!","what part of it is confusing you? i've programmed an album + few EP's worth of drums, could probably help you out."
"Question about programming drums!!","Honestly I don't even know where to start or what programs to use. I play guitar and have messed around with audacity to record. Basically I don't want to buy something and end up not being able to use it. What do you use/recommend?"
"Question about programming drums!!","OK this can get long real easily, but I will try to distill it down to some basic concepts.

First of all, you're going to need a way to sequence the drums. Either get a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation, basically any recording program like Logic, Pro Tools, Cubase, Reaper, Audacity, etc)  better than audacity that has something called a Piano Roll on it (which allows you to sequence MIDI notes in time with whatever song you're working on) or get TuxGuitar/Guitarpro/Powertab, any program that lets you write a drum track and export it as MIDI data. If you use a program like TuxGuitar, you'll still need a DAW that you can import the MIDI date into to be interpreted by your drum machine.

Next you'll need a program that can interpret that MIDI data and host a drum machine in it. For example, I use Steven Slate Drums hosted within Logic. I program my drums either in the Piano Roll in Logic or in Tuxguitar (in which case I'd export the drums as MIDI data and import into a track on Logic which has Steven Slate Drums on it). There's lots of other drum programs, some don't need to be hosted in a DAW to produce sound, but might not have a way to interpret MIDI data that you'd feed it, they might need the DAW's interpretive ability cause it's not built into the program. I THINK (not sure) EZDrummer is a standalone program that has an arrange function where you can drop in your MIDI date, or program your own. Not entirely sure, look it up on your own. I know Steven Slate is just a drum machine; you can edit what drum sounds you're using, what MIDI note triggers what drum, mix the drums within Steven Slate and/or send aux tracks out in Logic to separate each drum sound.

Then of course you need to know how to write drum beats. Best advice: make sure you know how meter and rhythm works, you should be comfortable with concepts like time signatures (at least basic ones like 4/4, 3/4, 6/8) and whole, half, quarter, eighth, sixteenth notes, triplets, etc. If you've never programmed a drum before, start by copying drums from a song you like. It's the only way you'll get a good feel for it. A drumset is always at LEAST a bass/kick drum and a snare, then you have toms (which you can have anywhere between 1-6 of, I usually have 4) and various cymbals (hi-hat, 1-3 crashes, a ride, china, splash) learn the different sounds of each drum, and where to use them. 

If you want, I can give you some real basic drum patterns later, but for now, I just got off work and must nap. hope this helps. if you want to hear some drums I programmed (but didn't mix, I left that to another engineer), listen to my deathcore at http://gravebornma.bandcamp.com or my electronic music at http://yearn.bandcamp.com"

"The Acacia Strain - Observer - Has anyone found the entire transcript? Not just Vincents parts?","This put my Google-fu to the test here as I know it has been hard to find everything that is in this song.  After a bit of googling parts of the second quote(the woman talking about the old days.) I stumbled across a Google+ profile that had a comment with the whole transcript on Youtube.  I really like this song and felt this album was a great culmination of their sound circa-The Dead Walk and their sound that came into play around Continent and onward.  This song right here demonstrates that this band would make a fucking killer sludge/doom band.  This song alone puts me through the ringer emotionally.  Here it is:

LYRICS  
**Vincent**  
Instead of fighting the sickness she is  
You’ll become the disease  
Give your life to the witch  
Give your life to the witch  
Give your life to the witch  
Give your life to the witch    

**Rust Cohle Quote**  
“You look in their eyes, even in a picture, doesn't matter if they're dead or alive, you can still read 'em. You know what you see? They welcomed it... not at first, but... right there in the last instant. It's an unmistakable relief. See, cause they were afraid, and now they saw for the very first time how easy it was to just... let go. Yeah They saw, in that last nanosecond, they saw... what they were. You, yourself, this whole big drama, it was never more than a jerry rig of presumption and dumb will, and you could just let go. To finally know that you didn't have to hold on so tight. To realize that all your life, all your love, all your hate, all your memories, all your pain, it was all the same thing. It was all the same dream, a dream that you had inside a locked room, a dream about being a person. And like a lot of dreams, there's a monster at the end of it.”  


**Abra Bigham**  
“Remember the old days... How everything used to be? We used to be so happy. I miss that. I miss us. How normal it used to be. You and I used to smile so much... Look at all that water. I love the ocean because it reminds me of all the wonderful times we used to have here. The sounds and the sights, and the smell, it just makes me so happy. All of those memories and feelings help me live. The hope that maybe everything will be like they used to be gives me a reason to wake up in the morning. I don’t dream anymore. I know a lot of people say that but I really don’t. It’s hard to dream when everything you used to dream about is a nightmare. I don’t know. I’m sorry. Sometimes I still cling to that memory, hoping. You always look the same while you’re asleep. It’s like reliving an old memory. So calm, so peaceful, almost happy. It reminds me of the old me, the one I thought I knew before all this. I’m not a stranger to these feelings. Loneliness, emptiness, anger. But I thought we worked through them. I thought we defeated them, together. Instead they stand in defiance in the back of my mind slowly inching their way forward again. When’s this going to stop? Tell me. Please tell me. Say you’ll make it better again. I miss the way it was. The way things were. I would rather die than know that I will never relive those moments again. Because this isn’t living, this isn’t anything at all. I would rather die.”  

**Vincent**  
She pulls you deeper from the world  
As you gasp your final breathe  
Say goodbye to the world  
And face your fate that’s worse than death  
She is the one you see when you close your eyes  
Spreader of fear, paralyzer of lies  
Gasping for words, and exploding your heart.  
Where is the distance alone in the dark?  

Give your life to the witch  
Surrender your last breathe to the witch  
Give your life to the witch  
Surrender your last breathe to the witch  


**Kurtz Quote from Apocalypse Now**  
“But you have no right to call me a murderer. You have a right to kill me. You have a right to do that... but you have no right to judge me. It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means. Horror... Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies!”  


**Vincent**  
Frozen to the bed and terror in my mind  
She calls out to me.   
I cannot scream  
I leave the world behind
I cannot scream  
I cannot scream  
I cannot scream  
I cannot scream  

Bury me in a nameless grave  
Bury me in a nameless grave  
Bury me in a nameless grave  
Bury me in a nameless grave﻿

"Beginner's Guide for All Shall Perish(Figured I'd take a crack at making a beginner's guide for the wiki.)","So, since anyone could submit a beginner's guide for the wiki here, I figured I'd take my crack at one of my all time top two deathcore bands.  All Shall Perish.  Let me know what you folks think.


First time I heard about All Shall Perish when Hate, Malice, Revenge dropped in 2003.  It blew my mind.  It was death metal with grooves, and it was so heavy.  They blended in a lot of melodic sections with a few solos.  Not to mention a high/low vocal approach that was just awesome.  That was before I knew anything about deathcore.  I just figured, metalcore was just getting heavier and heavier.  
**Hate.  Malice.  Revenge** - This album was a breakout.  There was a more prominent death metal influence on this one.  Not to mention it seemed to have been a little more mid-paced as opposed to having lots of speed that they would later employ.  Also, there were fewer solos on this album yet it wasn’t hurting for melody.  This album had some killer breakdowns on it.  They almost reminded me a little bit of a more melodic Internal Bleeding.  At the time, I don’t think the term breakdown was being used as much with it.  But it has them in droves.  Good examples would be “Sever the Memory”, the ending of “Deconstruction” are killer songs that showcased just how heavy this band can be.  Definitely a killer album that got quite a few spins from me when I got it.    
**Top Tracks:**  Laid to Rest, Sever the Memory, Deconstruction  
**The Price of Existence** - Damn, just damn.  This band went from a murky/groovy death metal band to full on deathcore.  This one was anticipated, but I don’t think anyone could bet on how good this album would be.  They lost their other vocalist and this is when Eddie Hermida joined.  This album was damn near perfect.  It starts right out of the gate with “Eradication” and just gets crazier from there.  This one had it all.  Frenetic pacing.  Awesome guitar solos.  Melodies.  Devastating breakdowns(All about that breakdown in “The True Beast.”)  Eddie Hermida just crushed the vocal performance.  His highs were painful but awesome.  His lows were pretty damn sickening.  He even threw in a few brees(but thankfully kept them in check.)  To this day I don’t think they ever really topped this album.  
**Top Tracks:**  Tough choice, “The Day of Justice,” “The True Beast,” and “There is No Business to be Done on a Dead Planet.”  But really, the whole damn thing was just amazing.  
**Awaken the Dreamers** - So this album was a dividing force amongst the fans.  From my observations, some loved it, and some hated it.  I was in the liked it camp.  It was not nearly as good as “The Price of Existence,” however, All Shall Perish firing on half its cylinders is still quite a bit ahead of many other deathcore bands.  They decided to inject even more melody into this album, and experiment more on it.  Incorporating a few clean sections(not really that clean, just shouted-style singing.) and then there was “Memories of a Glass Sanctuary.”  Which I don’t see too much bad about that song, it just really slows the momentum of the album compared to the rest of the songs.  They still contained the frenetic, and fast songs(“Stabbing to Purge Dissimulation” and “When Life Meant More…”)  However they threw in a couple mid-paced songs(“Never Again” and “Gagged, Bound, Shelved, and Forgotten”)  All in all what made this album not nearly as good as their previous album was the uneven pacing.  Whereas “The Price of Existence” was full speed ahead like a tricked up muscle car, “Awaken the Dreamers” felt like a sixteen year old trying to learn manual in a Civic.  Not their best, but still not horrible.  
**Top Tracks:**  When Life Meant More……., Stabbing To Purge Dissimulation  
**This is Where It Ends** - Well now, this was more like it.  They revisited and brought back most of their main sound from “The Price of Existence.”  That album is such a yardstick by which the rest of their discography is compared.  The frenetic pace was back all the way through.  They brought back the really sick breakdowns that just come out of no where.  You don’t expect them, but when they hit, they hit really hard.  The melody was still there, only they stopped messing around with clean sections and incorporated it back into the riffs and guitar solos.  It felt like home again.  Except for one big issue that still puts it few steps behind.  It was so damn loooonnnggg!!!  That was my main beef with this album. It’s good, but you have to really clear an afternoon for it.  Clocking in at 57 some minutes, the songs on this one tend to drag a bit, almost meander.  Some of the best songs are the shortest.  “Divine Illusion, “Embrace the Curse(all about that breakdown midway through.)”, and “The Death Plague” were some of the sickest they had written since their earlier days.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s a good album, they just could have chopped some time off it.  It was a great note to go out on. Then Eddie left, and all was darkness.  Either way it was still an awesome album.  That and the only long song of this album to be truly epic though is “A Pure Evil.”  It totally reminded me of “The True Beast.”  Almost like it could be a sequel.  
**Top Tracks:**  Divine Illusion, The Death Plague, Embrace the Curse, A Pure Evil.

"Lifeforms - String Theory","I know, I just think they are boring and shallow while trying to bank on the space angle to sound cool. Just another stickler for lyrics I guess. They have a super gnarly sound, I give them that. My favorite part being ""DON'T FORGET WHERE YOU CAME FROM"". and the breakdown that follows it. I haven't listened to much of their other stuff, maybe they have some variety in the lyrics of other tracks?"
"Lifeforms - String Theory","Yeah man, wasn't trying to knock you at all. I kinda feel like they are lackluster as well. However, I'm pretty heavily into sci-fi stuff in general, so bands like Rings of Saturn, Aversions Crown, and the like really get my jimmies going. Their *Multidimensional* album in general I found to be quite raw, but quite a fulfilling listen. They play alot on the Djent side of things, but I'm also kinda into the extended range guitars and unpredictable rhythms. All in all, Lifeforms are bland lyrically, but I love the way the vocals fit into the rest of the music."

That said I was somewhat into deathcore and the Acacia Strain in middle school and some of high school from like 2004-2008. This sounds like a totally different band than The Acacia Strain I remember and not in a good way. They sound like very other generic deathcore band out there. They used to have a really unique, thrashy, heavy, sound that took a lot of influence from hardcore. Not anymore I guess...."
"The Acacia Strain - The Mouth Of The River.

"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?",""
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Introductions and filler tracks full of samples and repeating riffs.  
1.  If you are doing an intro, show off some of what we're in for if you have some sick instrumental work in the album.  Make it fit into the context of the first song.  If possible, forget the intro.  I'd rather have less songs than have an intro and think there are more songs.  If they have to have an intro, put it in with the first song instead of making it a separate track.  
2.  Filler tracks.  If it's going to be an instrumental.  Make it sick. Give us some killer instrumental work.  And/or if the album has a concept/theme, some how incorporate it with the rest of the album.  
3.  I've noticed a few bands including clean vocals in some albums as of late(I'm looking at you As Blood Runs Black.)  I haven't witnessed them overused or used to where it's annoying.  Keeping cleans out of deathcore would be nice.  I mean it is a pretty brutal genre.  And if the song has this killer momentum and is chugging or speeding along and all of the sudden a clean section comes in, it just kills it for me.  I expect it from metalcore.  The cleans are often awesome in that because I often find sections where the cleans are soaring and epic.  Just doesn't seem to work for deathcore for these ears.  

Of course I'm sure someone will have something to counter these but they are just things that I personally am not a fan of with deathcore.  All in all, it is still one of my favorite genres.  It keeps getting better."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I agree completely. An intro should fucking lay down the law right off the bat. So this is suffering has done it right just to name one . Filller tracks have to go. The holy guile did a rap but I wasn't digging his flow too much. At least it was content though instead of meaningless bull shit. "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","So This is Suffering is such a killer band.
"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Agreed on the cleans. I just got into SHOKRAN, and they fucking rip, and while I don't dislike their clean vocals, I think they would be better without them. "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I hate intros that are 2 minutes long and nothing but sound effects. When I'm browsing for new music, I give a song 30 seconds to capture my interest before I move on. I can't tell you how many awesome song I found that I previously passed on because of boring intros.  "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Totally agreed.  It does get aggravating."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Im getting really bored of the generic af whore killing lyrics like you can write other lyrics and still be heavy"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","A lot of deathcore has poorly written lyrics, which is why Rings of Saturn and Acrania are very refreshing with the lyrics. Much better than what is considered generic, about death (even though RoS is basically death but with a different twist)."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","""Whore killing lyrics"" are certainly not generic. In fact, they're nowhere near common enough imo. The term you're looking for is ""poorly written"", which most deathcore lyrics in general usually are."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I suppose i did exaggerate but i could name you off like at least 10 bands off the top of my head where lyrics about killing women are present"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","By my count:

1 Whitechapel album

1 Chelsea Grin EP

1 Thy Art Is Murder EP, and 1 demo

1 Misericordiam album

1 line in 1 AngelMaker song

The rest I can think of, which are indeed very many, are all brutal/slam death bands, grindcore and its derivatives, and even some metalcore. Misogynistic lyrics are common, but not so much in deathcore in particular. I for one adore lyrics about torturing whores and slaughtering sluts etc etc. Obviously when they're poorly written, it's terrible.

But so are all poorly written lyrics. The only time you get a free pass is if you're exceptionally Russian, exceptionally brutal, and your English is fucking terrible."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Ehh fair enough, i can think of a few more but it would have been better to say poorly written lyrics, i guess its just me but every time i hear a song with lyrics like that it bugs me, not because im offended or anything it just seems old to me i guess "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","It's a lot easier to throw ""whore"" or ""slut"" on the end of a breakdown line than it is to rewrite it so it actually has impact.

But still, words like those can have a fuckton of impact if used well. The lyrics on Whitechapel's first album are surprisingly well-written and rather eloquent. The lyrics on Infinite Death aren't super intelligent or nothing but they work perfectly. There's no particular lyrical theme that intrinsically suffers because of its literal applications. Some of them do ""get old"" over time, but none of them become impossible to use properly."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","so far, none, in fact, the way ive been seeing it, deathcore has been doing nothing but improving over the last 3 or 4 years, incorporating more technicality, versatility and melody, and bands seem to be really branching out and experimenting with it"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Very true. It's really come to the forefront of musical progress in recent years, and that's amazing. Still, I see so many people complaining about stuff like piq squealing, open-note breakdowns, djent fusions, orchestral elements (don't know why the fuck anyone would hate this though), overusing sweep techniques, the recent explosion of crowdfunding campaigns amongst deathcore artists, etc.

And if there's so much to complain about, I'd like to hear some explainations from those that do."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I love pig squeals."

this isnt unique to deathcore, and even if it was, its not like it runs rampant

"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","What can I say? Reddit likes to think it's so intellectually critical of things, when really it just collectively whines about everything with absolutely no founded arguments."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Seriously? Pig squeals are my favorite. "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","You hit the nail on the head. "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I hate the whole down tempo phase happening right now. Like yeah, there's a few bands who are awesome, mainly Black Tongue, but listening to a whole album sounds like just one big long breakdown. Go on blogspots and forums and all you see are ""deathcore/down tempo"". It annoys me. 

They need to bring back the tech phase. "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","If you like technicality and you don't already know about this sub, you're welcome.  /r/TechnicalDeathMetal"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I am very much with you on the blogspots and forums. It's incredible how nearly every other release right now is a down tempo band. I think the production quality is cool on a lot of them, and they sound absolutely massive, but it's so hard to bounce to. Maybe they are making deathcore for the moon..."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Yeah there are way too many bands trying to revive beatdown and failing. Black Tongue, Villains, Traitors to some extent, A Memoria Brooded, Beyond Deviation (especially), Abbadon, and I guess you could say I Declare War are all doing a pretty phenominal job of it. But the rest all seem to blow really hard.

Although, the tech shit kind of bothers me to. Of course you have bands like Rings of Saturn, going all out with it and it's amazing. Then you have bands like Ovid's Withering and Thy Art Is Murder, showing that ""technical"" doesn't actually just mean constant sweeping and scales upon scales. But a lot of bands I find don't know the difference, and end up just going up and down and up and down constantly. It's atrocious, especially when they're playing the exact same scale the entire time (looking at you, 95% of tech death).

Technical dynamics in metal are really similar to ""Prog"" dynamics in metal. If you do it well, it can be fucking amazing. If you fuck it up, even the slightest bit, you're completely fucked."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Black Tongue and Genocide District are the only two downtempo/beatdown bands i like"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Bands who use an 8-string guitar when they simply just make open string chugs or a few rhythmic triplets. I get that they want the heavy tone, but my personal opinion is they should utilize more of the guitar instead and maybe just downtune a 7-string."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Conducting from the Grave uses 7/8 string guitars (i forget which) but really utilize their full potential"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","As a guitarist, I never understood this. Chugging is great, breakdowns are fun as fuck to play, but why the hell wouldn't you want to use the whole damn thing? Why the fuck would any guitarist choose to just refuse to do any soloing? Or even playing *any* leads for that matter."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","My roommate and I have this conversation all the time. 

I love my lead work, and I love learning new scales and forms, and he flat out refuses to even crack a theory book. 

I don't get it man. "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Well, I play lead, and I only know the very basics of theory. And even at that, I only know the basics of theory on piano. Theory itself really isn't necessary. It's a great tool to help a lot of people understand what they're *trying* to play. But I've never had any trouble understand what I'm *trying* to play, and my only limitation are my hands themselves. 

Some people, myself included though I don't mean to brag, just have an easier time creating music. Just like some people have an easier time recreating music they hear, which I cannot do. That's why I mostly play improvisational. It's easy for me, because I for whatever reason just have this ability to feel the entire fretboard whilst playing only a section of it. And I don't even know the location of any single note in the tuning I'm playing in right now. 

The best way I can put it, is the first think black metal ever taught me. Notes, scales, and *especially* keys, mean absolutely nothing when it comes time to create. Create what sounds good, create what sounds terrible, and create what sounds so bad it comes all the way back around and sounds good again. That is how music is created. There are no rules."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","AHHH. It drives me nuts to see so many strings go to so little use. Tosin Abasi and Javier Reyes know how to use 8 strings to their potential. 

[Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmwiZhC8uWQ)"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I feel like I encounter more and more people that are just rude as fuck in the deathcore scene. I get that generally it's a genre used to express anger and other emotions like that, but that doesn't give you an excuse to be a prick at shows. Music is supposed to unite people. "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Uh, repetitive breakdowns. It's good to include the occasional breakdown here and there, but don't include two ""brutal"" breakdowns in EVERY song"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I agree with you, it can sometimes become pretty boring if the band focuses too much on the breakdowns. To me it feels like many bands are just writing their songs like build ups to their breakdowns, It can work for a few songs on a album. But if every song is written that way, it tends to get old fast. "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Glossy, over-produced albums. "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","What is over-produced to you? When everything sounds clear and good (i.e. Ovid's Withering), or when the mix is too even and you hear things you shouldn't normally be hearing, like snare echo or uneven bass pressure?"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I am not him, but I think the new BOO is overproduced: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yqWtYD8"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I'm guessing maybe the new fallujah content. I think Chemical Cave was a little too over produced for me, the synth, the layers of guitar effects, idk. They did great with the production of most of the other songs on The Flesh Prevails, the synth added a distinct mood for the whole album, but I think it was over done. The editing was also a little messy, vocals too quiet or too loud at some point, just very little things. But I think the album was really well written. 
"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I agree that the vocals on the new album were really poorly produced, but everything else was great I think. The synth kind of made the contrasting elements in the instrumentation a little abrasive at times, but other than that it worked rather well.

Honestly, I really wish I could get into Fallujah, but the vocals are really boring on TFP and on The Harvest Wombs. The only thing I really like from them is Nomadic."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","It really doesn't have to do with the mix levels. 

I'll probably get down voted for this, but I really loved Burning the Masses' ""Volatile Existence"" when it came out in 2008 I think, and I was really excited for them to release a full length full production album.  When ""Mind Control"" came out it felt like they took all of their raw energy and sound and put it through the computer, resulting in a much more slick but bland production.

1. don't crowd bash, sorry, not cool, albeit fun
2. Practicing your cirque du soleil routine is not tough. It does not look tough.
3. don't be a pussy, actually get in the pit away from the sides where people are trying to watch a show, they don't want to dance with you. again, sorry.
4. you are going to get hit, be aware, you're in the pit. You do not need to fight the person that hit you. They are doing what you are doing. 
5. arms in toward your chest. Throw some elbows. Stomp it out. If you have to throw and arm, at least you're in the middle.

There are more rules to this list, but I promise, we are not all bad people. "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I am a slam dancer and I follow your rules to a T. I'm not there to fuck some kid up in the pit, I'm there to express myself in a style that may look silly but when I feel the music flow through me I can't help myself to throw down.

I was at a show last night and after Cruel Hand finished there set I was walking behind some kids talking about how much they love to punch and fuck kids up. The fucking nerve of those bastards. I really wanted to approach those kids and tell them that they are in there for the wrong reasons and they belong somewhere else. Just because you are in a mosh pit and bigger and older than people in there doesn't give you the authority to fuck some kids day up. Its people like them who can mosh pits and slam dancers a bad name"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Totally agree. Glad there are more of us. I feel the same way you do. Fuck it. I am a mad guy most the time keeping it in a nice quiet shell. When I got to a show, I want to get violent WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET VIOLENT.

Those kids sound horrible. Those are the ""Bash approved"" kids if you ask me :) Keep doing what you do man. BTW, I've noticed in SF, at least, that dancing seems to be dying in Deathcore since most deathcore bands tour with deathmetal bands and push pits are the norm. I weigh 135 so I lose by default in push pits. 

Do you notice this? Show recommendations you'd have if I want to go dance? "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Well I'm from Boston and the hardcore scene is pretty alive here so you can go to a pop punk show and probably see a small percent of deathcore kids, like myself, at these shows throwing down hard style but the brotherhood is true and there is a lot of respect. The show where I overheard the bashers was down in Florida and it gave me a homesick feeling because I know I wouldn't hear that shit in Boston. Also I'm 165 lbs and that is considered small in the genres crowd as well so I feel ya on the push pit thing."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I'm tired of over the top electronic sampling.
I'm tired of breakdowns every fifteen seconds."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","For me, nothing pisses me off more than listening to a deathcore song and thinking ""holy shit this is brutal"". Then 30 seconds into the song, they hit you with some weak-as-fuck monotonous ""growls"" with absolutely no range, power, or depth to them. Or they just throw shitty hardcore vocals on it. I'm a big fan of high screams, so if you're going to do only lows, they'd better be good. Otherwise you're leaning into BDM territory, and if you're not slammin' as fuck, you'll fail at that too.

Deathcore is a somewhat vocal-centric kind of music. If the rest of the band is going to commit to something brutal, the vocalist has to step his game up as well."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Breakdowns that last way too long. I love brutal stuff more than anyone I know, but those 40-second breakdowns with the 30 BPM bass drum and crashes is slow and boring to me. "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","With you on that. I hate when a band drops a sick breakdown, and just as I'm thinking the next verse is going to knock my socks off, I'm treated to another 4 bars of the same breakdown. Completely unnecessary.

I also don't like when a breakdown is too short, but I feel that it can be done well."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Have the lyrics always been like this?   Just for shock value and nothing else?

Personally I like listening to lyrics I can sing out loud with no one looking at me like I'm some kind of psychopath. "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","1. You shouldn't be singing along to deathcore lyrics out loud. At least not in public.

2. You shouldn't be *singing* along to deathcore lyrics at all.

3. A lot of lyrics in metal as a whole are written for shock value elements. While this is true, a lot of lyricists actually believe in what they write. A lot of lyrics about morbid subjects such as violence, murder, rape, necrophilia, etc. are METAPHORS for things the person writing about them is experiencing and/or feeling. For example, a deathcore band might feature a lyric about slashing some whore's throat. Ok, so what does that mean? Well, it could be a metaphor for betrayl, as the act could be vengeant in nature. The ""whore"" labeling could also refer to betrayl in the form of infidelity, or perhaps refer to someone who is being corrupted by material reward. Slashing their throat could indicate a desire to deal with the conflict as quickly as possible, or a nod to keeping someone silent. 

Don't assume that because something is morbid that the person writing it doesn't mean it. There is hidden meaning behind almost everything in the entire world, and that's what makes language an art form in the first place as well, through poetry. Also, just because someone might mean those things, literally or metaphorically, doesn't make them a psychopath. It just means they're putting their feelings and fantasies down on a page and turning it into music. It's not your place to tell them what their art has to be about. 

Even still, there probably are a couple of real psychopaths in deathcore. It's a form of music almost entirely based on making as inhuman of noises one can muster. We already knew all the goregrind kids were psycho, why not deathcore? Skinny jeans mean you can't be clinically insane?"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","Over producing vocals to the point that they sound like they are coming out of a can."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I might get some hate for this, but: 

I don't like Deathcore bands with positive/cheerish lyrics. I can sorta understand if a band chooses to have a more upbeat sound with more melodies and catchy choruses to it, then the positive lyrical approach might work for their sound. To me it makes more sense if the band plays Metalcore or has some sort of happier/sadder vibe to it.  

But when it comes to deathcore, I think the subject matter should be darker and more hateful to match up with the angry and sometimes rhythmical sound. 
I mean like, It's called DEATHcore for a reason. 
Shure it's totally ok if a band chooses a positive direction, it's just that I usually have a hard time getting into those types of lyrics. "
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I agree. Positive lyrics are more of a metalcore/post-hardcore staple, and even then I wish bands in those styles wouldn't constantly try to be so uplifting."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","""whore killing"" lyrics"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","The only complaint I have is that I really don't like the djent tone so when I hear deathcore bands do it I sort of lose interest. Like the second (maybe 3rd) track on Aversion Crowns new album, really good... then bwow bwow bwow x20."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","*The* djent tone? There are many, many different kinds of djenty tones. Some deathcore bands use a high-gain tone with a lower pitch, like Ovid's Withering or Lorna Shore, and they use it really well. Some bands use a more bass or mid-heavy tone with very flat distortion, like Delusions Of Grandeur or Aversion's Crown. Some use the straight-up thall as fuck drone thing Vildhjarta came up with.

I love all of them, but I will agree that some deathcore bands use them really poorly. Especially when they kick in a djent tone for one little groove, but the rest of their tones already fit groove patterns well enough. It's really uneccessary. There's also a weird gray area between completely committing to the tone, and not using it enough, which makes the whole concept fall apart."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I'm sure there are differences, but as a drummer I couldn't begin to know the differences or terminology lol. All I know is if it sounds like Volumes, I'm not into it. Aversions Crown is my only example of it ruining a song, I heard it come on the other day and it made me change the track. Everything else was good, I just like the crunchy, deep, chugs way more. To each their own."
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","I don't like the djenty sound found in a lot of newer stuff

but what I hate most is obnoxious  triggers.... Some examples are [anything from infant annihilator's album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCeRWaIh5Hw), [Aversion's Crown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tFYdzSB8bI), [Ovid's Withering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfoXYpR4PXI)

Love the latter two bands mentioned, but IA... meh

"
"Inspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?","If you had said early Rings Of Saturn I'd have agreed, but I find absolutely nothing annoying about the triggers used on those bands' drums."

"Help me get into Chelsea Grin! What should I be listening to?","self titled ep "
"Help me get into Chelsea Grin! What should I be listening to?","It depends on how hard you like your music. They've got a bit softer as their albums have been releasing so starting at the beginning and going to the last album would be best.

I'm honestly a big fan of their newer stuff though; check out Clockwork and Playing With Fire. For older I'd go with Cheyne Stokes and Crewcabanger both off their first EP."
"Help me get into Chelsea Grin! What should I be listening to?","God fucking damn, Cheyne Stokes is sick."
"Help me get into Chelsea Grin! What should I be listening to?","I'd go through it chronologically, Chelsea Grin EP, Desolation of Eden, My Damnation, Evolve EP, and then Ashes to Ashes"

Their self titled EP and Desolation of Eden are the best for heavy stuff, Evolve is quite progressive, and My Damnation and Ashes to Ashes are both all around quite good. Ashes to Ashes is my personal favorite album from them and in general."
"Help me get into Chelsea Grin! What should I be listening to?","Their album Desolation of Eden was their best imo. It was their darkest, most evil sounding stuff that they put out.

"Help me get into Chelsea Grin! What should I be listening to?","As much as I can't stand their first album, you should give Desolation of Eden a shot. It's the fan favorite afaik.

Though, if you're going on my personal taste give their new album Ashes to Ashes a shot. It's their best imo. 

It kind of depends what you want though. Their newer stuff has a much smoother, cleaner sound. With way more melody. Desolation of Eden is much more...dry? I don't know the word for it. But it's also way chuggier. So if you're down with chugs you might like it more. "

"All Shall Perish are coming back","This made me smile. I still dont know how i will feel about ASP without eddie. Shall have to wait and see. "
"All Shall Perish are coming back","The Price of Existence is one of the albums that got me into deathcore, so im happy they aren't calling it quits, glad they are going with a new vocalist too, I like Eddie but not enough to hear him in two bands"
"All Shall Perish are coming back","The Price of Existence is in my top 3 deathcore albums of all time. I don't know how they'll sound without eddie, but I have high hopes for the next album."
"All Shall Perish are coming back","Ive always felt very meh with these guys. I dont hate their stuff, but i would never put it on willingly"
"All Shall Perish are coming back","TIL there's someone that doesn't like The Price of Existence "
"All Shall Perish are coming back","I like awaken the dreamers much better :p"
"All Shall Perish are coming back","Probably because it's amazing from start to finish. I don't think I'll ever hear another deathcore album I like half as much. "
"All Shall Perish are coming back","shocking to me as well

that whole album from start to finish is one of my favorite of all time

the last relapse will forever be my favorite ASP track of all time 

such a dark subject covered with brilliant riffs and insane vocals, how can anyone who claims to enjoy metal ever hate that album "
"All Shall Perish are coming back","I was a casual fan, until I saw them live.  Amazing set!  I recommend that if you have the chance, you check them out."
"All Shall Perish are coming back","Ive seen live videos, im just unimpressed"
"All Shall Perish are coming back","I've seen em live a few times. Every time it was honestly hit or miss. If the crowd wasn't feeling it eddie would get kinda pissy and start not giving a shit. I can honestly only think of one show where the planets aligned and the set was overthetop badass."
"All Shall Perish are coming back","I saw them in a little show (maybe 100 - 200 people? ) where eddie had to be in front of the stage like with the crowd and was honestly one of the best shows ive been too"
"All Shall Perish are coming back","This is what makes me jealous of people who live in Australia. I feel like there are a lot of venues there where the singer is in the the crowd. I've seen pictures with Thy Art is Murder, I Exalt, Tomb of Doom all in those situations. I remember local shows like this and there is a great energy. "
"All Shall Perish are coming back","IMO. Eddie does have shitty stage presence. In ASP, he just stood there, hairy, belting shit out (top notch at that). In SS, he did the same thing. He jumped some on the bouncies, but that was it. 

I think this album will be disappointing if you are looking for a deathcore album. Though every fiber in my body hopes for the best."
"All Shall Perish are coming back","&gt;he just stood there, hairy

um... what"
"All Shall Perish are coming back","I saw them during their last tour. Eddie had grown his hair long + his face hair long. It looked like a shirt with a brown weeble on top. "
"All Shall Perish are coming back","Ben was the reason I loved so many songs and Eddie was a great vocalist for for them. I don't think they'll be the same without those two. "
"All Shall Perish are coming back","Looking forward to the new music they'll drop. Hope it lives up to their older albums though."
"All Shall Perish are coming back","[Francesco dropped a hint back in november](http://instagram.com/p/u_SHKRuwPA/). I can't wait for new content."
"All Shall Perish are coming back","Artusato also has a solo instrudjental project. If you like Angel Vivaldi or Modern Day Babylon it's worth a listen."
"All Shall Perish are coming back","Yes Yes Yes!!!  Been a long time fan of this band for a long time.  Definitely was unhappy that Eddie left.  I hope they get one that brought the rage just as much as he did.  From that Nuclear Blast promo looks like a lot of good metal maybe coming out this year:  Enslaved, Immolation, Meshuggah, and Nile."
"All Shall Perish are coming back","if Eddie is not the vocalist it is basically a totally different band

I treat vocals as another insturment, and usually each vocalist is unique, the downside is that changing a vocalist can drastically change the way a band sounds overall

I really, desperately, want Eddie to come back to ASP and keep putting out incredible music even if he is in SS and ASP simultaneously 

One of the only regrets I can remember having was not going to see ASP when they played locally a couple years ago, I would absolutely relish the opportunity to see them live, all the better if Eddie was back with them so that their whole catalog was still playable "

"NOCTURNAL BLOODLUST - DESPERATE (Japanese deathcore)","Fucking love this band, but I'd say they're metalcore before anything else. The orchestration of the heavier aspects never really touch on a deathcore formula to be honest, and the fact that nearly every song has cleans pushes it in that direction. Their screamer is fucking brutal though, and Grimoire is an awesome record, so I digress."
"NOCTURNAL BLOODLUST - DESPERATE (Japanese deathcore)","I'd say it's a mix of both.  
There are tracks on some of the older albums that are heavier then the heaviest shit I've seen on here.  
Unfortunately the fact that they look like asian anime cosplayers turns many off, give these guys a chance."

I don't know shit about guitars/tone/ how to record or track any of that nonsense.

All around a solid 2-thumbs up. I'd have to harp on the guitar tones, I don't know what it's missing, but the rhythms weren't popping enough IMO. Whether it be the tone, or it just felt flat I can't say.

Lead guitar perfect, I digged the drums through and through (I like a loud snare lol ) "

"So im new to Aegaeon","Definitely best to start with Exponential Transcendence then go into Dissension, check out Neural Union with the new vocalist first if you want.

Favourite songs would be Neural Union, A Product Of Variety, Reshaping The Mulverse, Dimensions Of Reality and Demise."
"So im new to Aegaeon","I always think the best way to get into a band is to listen to their discography chronologically, see how the band progresses"

"So im new to Aegaeon","They don't have that much material, three EPs and a full length last time I checked, so it shouldn't be hard to go through all of it. "
"So im new to Aegaeon","I personally love their first EP. It's so dark and brutal, I suggest that you just start there and then move forward in their discography. "

"The intro will never get old, Rings of Saturn - Lalassu Xul","I like this album more than the previous."
"The intro will never get old, Rings of Saturn - Lalassu Xul","I generally consider the first album the most technical, the second a nice middle ground.
But I really am liking this newest one. Really catchy and heavy. Vocals are on point. 
Also, as a not so much of a  Suicide Silence fan, I can't stop listening to the cover. 


Just my 2¢"
"The intro will never get old, Rings of Saturn - Lalassu Xul","So do I, although I do think the melodies were more interesting on Dingir"
"The intro will never get old, Rings of Saturn - Lalassu Xul","To be fair, pretty much all Rings of Saturn will never get old. But yes, they have a lot of unique sounds they bring to this genre."
"The intro will never get old, Rings of Saturn - Lalassu Xul","I'm seeing these guys when they come into town with As Blood Runs Black and I have a question, how good are they live? I remember hearing rumors that they can't play as fast as they do on the album but I think that was a bunch of bullshit. "
"The intro will never get old, Rings of Saturn - Lalassu Xul","When I've seen them, they absolutely kill it. I was blown away. It's worth noting they aren't playing anything off the new album this tour though. "
"The intro will never get old, Rings of Saturn - Lalassu Xul","Ah that's a bummer, still excited though "
"The intro will never get old, Rings of Saturn - Lalassu Xul","The whole not playing as fast as they record is a myth(maybe?) that spawned when people started saying they record at half speed and then speed it up, I haven't personally been able to see them live but plenty of my friends have and always tell me they play perfectly fine. [Lucas Mann is awesome and knows how to play the stuff he writes just fine and has addressed the nay sayers plenty of times](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfCYgorqgLA).(Skip to 16:10 to see the informational bit)"

We've both seen them multiple times, so I definitely trust his opinion on that one. So you'll enjoy yourself."

"What makes you love deathcore?","Previously I was a huge fan of death metal and had bad opinions on deathcore mainly because I thought it was all scene kid bullshit for teenagers. Then I learned there was more to deathcore than suicide silence and BMTH.

It has all the elements that I love of death metal - the blast beats, tremolo picking, the dark evil themes, etc... *but* it has brain melting breakdowns which just make it so much better than traditional death metal IMO.

Also, the production values seem to be a lot higher which I really really prefer in metal. Its probably why I cant get into black metal. I can tolerate a lot of death metal because I grew up with it... but the production in a lot of deathcore stuff has spoiled me and it just isn't the same going back listening to some of my old favorite dm stuff."
"What makes you love deathcore?","My favorite part is explaining to friends and family that I'm listening to a band called Infant Annihilator"
"What makes you love deathcore?","That's always a fun one. Not to mention a teacher noticing the songs on the computer such as Bathed in Placenta, and thinking you're some sort of psychopathic murderer "
"What makes you love deathcore?","Adds 10lbs to my bench press."
"What makes you love deathcore?","/thread"
"What makes you love deathcore?","I *love* telling people that my favorite band's names, and showing them what they sound like. It's always hilarious when people say things like 'but you seem so normal', or 'I just don't get how anyone likes the screaming.' 

But aside from petty reasons such as that, I love the vibe of the music. The heaviness, the complexity, the various cultural music styles they incorporate, the low screams, the high screams; it also has a sound that is just so different, I can't help but not like it. Also, there are no whiny vocals like there are in metalcore.

But yeah, incredible stuff. The only thing these bands need to work on are their lyrics. They can get a bit cheesy sometimes. "
"What makes you love deathcore?","The ""heaviness"" of it. Can't really explain it. Plus that it sounds so unique compared to allot of other genres, makes it really interesting. "
"What makes you love deathcore?","That element of it that makes you frown and unintentionally make an angry face. "
"What makes you love deathcore?","Or when your favorite song comes on, and you try and sing along with it. Growls and screeching. Feels so exhilarating."
"What makes you love deathcore?","When a breakdown is about to happen and people don't understand why you start shooshing them and look like you're about to shit yourself. "
"What makes you love deathcore?","Honestly it's the emotion that draws me in. The anger, the hatred, the sadness. "
"What makes you love deathcore?","Anger? Hatred? Sadness? more like Badassness"
"What makes you love deathcore?","The surprised look of people's faces when they ask what I was listening to on my old school mp3 player, and the shock of the name of the bands I listened to (As Blood Runs Black - Allegiance album 2008). Yeah good times.
"
"What makes you love deathcore?","For me its the energy, everyone's standing still as the next band comes on stage then as soon as the song starts the crowd just explodes into movement and chaos. It's one of the few moments I feel truly alive."
"What makes you love deathcore?","This, a thousand times this.  I live for concerts, being able to let loose and the exhilarating rush of power. "
"What makes you love deathcore?","Well...

The emotion, and there is also a huge appeal to me of pushing the limits. As in gutterals, fast guitar and solos, shredding drums, none of it is easy to do. I love seeing the sweat drop off of the musicians playing. The singing and dancing crowd. 

All of it. And best of all...

There is no smoke and mirrors. 

I do prefer more technical deathcore/dm/wtfever over beatdown or sludge, though, so take that how you will. 

My favorite albums of all time are probably Colors, Akeldema, Onset of Putrefaction, and The Harvest Wombs. Each album is different, bringing completely different sounds to the table, while all remaining true to themselves as musicians. 


 
"
"What makes you love deathcore?","Fallujah fuck yes!"
"What makes you love deathcore?","Well, there are the triggered as fuck drums with some bands."
"What makes you love deathcore?","Yeah, but triggers don't bother me. Drummer still has to keep tempo, which is where the skill is at. "
"What makes you love deathcore?","&gt;It has all the elements that I love of death metal - the blast beats, tremolo picking, the dark evil themes, etc... but it has brain melting breakdowns which just make it so much better than traditional death metal IMO.

you hit the nail on the head m8, also the drums are groovier, the vocalists are more versatile, theres more opportunity for melody"
"What makes you love deathcore?","Everyone seems to be ignoring Melodic Death. Bands like Children of Bodom, Soilwork, Amon Amarth and Dark Tranquility keep plenty of melody."
"What makes you love deathcore?","I consider Melodeath to be a different genre, and even so, Melodeath can get very boring"
"What makes you love deathcore?","The very visceral emotions it causes.  How it can be as heavy and as skillful as any other subgenre, but it still keeps groove as it's focal point.   "
"What makes you love deathcore?","When people see the album art, the looks on their faces. "

"What makes you love deathcore?","[deleted]"
"What makes you love deathcore?","Melody, blast beats, vocals that switch from high to low, sort of lo-fi or dirty production, and most of all the sporadic riffs. It doesn't really flow like some genres. It just hits you with riffs in a sort of one and done fashion. It's not my absolute favorite genre, but it's #2 or #3. "
"What makes you love deathcore?","What is your favorite genre?"
"What makes you love deathcore?","Metalcore, specifically Melodic Metalcore, preferably low on chugs/breakdowns. Stuff like Haste the Day, Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall (not that familiar with these guys sadly), The Agony Scene, As I Lay Dying. Riffs + chorus stuff. The more melodeathy the better. It might become melodeath in the future if there are enough active bands doing stuff like [Suspension of Disbelief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTZrjYF84A) by Into Eternity. "
"What makes you love deathcore?","The sheer brutality of the music i think. The vocals and drums are just so over the top that it creates a unique sound. Some of the riffs are nice but it's the drums and vocals that do it for me (and guitars for RoS too obviously). Plus it's funny when people ask you what music you listen and you can say all the fucked up shit (IA ...). I know most people will not even consider it music, I didn't too at first, but now it's starting to become my favorite genre. Props to youtube for suggesting me decapitation fornication which was probably my gateway to deathcore."
"What makes you love deathcore?","I just love the breakdowns. I can never get enough "
"What makes you love deathcore?","Slicing riffage, up beat fast blast beats followed by slowed down evil breakdown. It's never verse chorus verse chorus. It's controlled chaos. "
"What makes you love deathcore?","the speed and aggression  amd the riffs you get from death metal which is then enhanced with a breakdown is just amazing."
"What makes you love deathcore?","prefer the vocals in deathcore when comparing it to death metal
but I listen to everything except most power metal (three inches of blood is amazing)"
"What makes you love deathcore?","The beat. All metal does have a general beat, but a lot of deathcore has such a heavy and defined beat, its hard not to Bob your head to it. I listen to bits of all music, deathcore, rap, and classical is all my favorites. Something with a defined and strong beat gets my attention more than anything. Death metal and other sub genres are good to me still too, but none seem so defined by their chug-chug- chug melodies. "
"What makes you love deathcore?","Breakdowns :D"
"What makes you love deathcore?","I used to hate deathcore too for the same reason, but it is my favorite subgenre of metal now, next to black metal. I still love lo production metal, and I enjoy the classics just as much. "
"What makes you love deathcore?","Nothing.

I just love it, the way it sounds, the adrenaline I feel listening to some songs, even some lyrics to some songs after I google 'em up of course."
"What makes you love deathcore?","There's no singing (I think, I'm pretty old and get genres mixed up). Don't get me wrong, I'm a soul man when my wife is around, but I'm just not in to brutally heavy guitar and apocalyptic break-downs with some sort of aria talking place.  
I'll admit that in this city of bros blasting vocal dance in rice shit-boxes wearing short-shorts, listening to deathcore in traffic is a guilty pleasure. "
"What makes you love deathcore?","I love listening to deathcore in my car!

&gt;listening to deathcore in traffic is a guilty pleasure.

"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","I recently had the opportunity to see Whitechapel and Upon a Burning Body, and I have to say that it was honestly one of the best show experiences that I've ever had. Afterwards, while discussing the show with my friends I got to thinking about which show out of all that I've been to that I enjoyed the most.
Personally, I would have to say that a show that I went to a couple of years ago with Impending Doom, August Burns Red and My Child My Bride was my favorite, so what's your's Reddit?"
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","For Deathcore, I went to Thrash and Burn '09.  It was Oceano, Veil of Maya, For the Fallen Dreams, Emmure (I know I know), Devil Driver, My Children My Bride, Despised Icon, Periphery, and Red River Revival.  A lot of those bands aren't really deathcore, but it was a fun show nonetheless.  My favorite show ever was He Is Legend because I got to smoke a blunt with them in their tour van back in August in Newport Ky. "
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","I love all of those bands haha"
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","Hell yeah dude, no hate."
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","I wish I could have seen Despised Icon in their prime. :("
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","They were awesome man for sure.  A friend of mine got his nose broken in the pit when they played Day of Mourning haha."
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","Awesome. Haha one of the few bands where every one of their albums were amazing. "
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","No need to be ashamed I think Emmure kicks ass."
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","for deathcore, probably this year's Summer Slaughter. I loved seeing TAIM with a longer set, and Fallujah was just fantastic

Overall though, a few years back I saw Roger Waters preform The Wall, and was more than blown away. The show started kind of normal, but throughout the first half, they built up a gigantic wall across the stage and were projecting on it. By the start of the second half, the wall covered the stage completely and the band played behind the wall (with the exception of the guitarist who climbed up on top for the solo of Comfortably Numb). Then, at the end of The Trial, when ""Tear Down The Wall"" is chanted, they knocked the wall down and played Outside The Wall as an acoustic.

"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","Agreed with this year's SS. Awesome. WTR lacked a bit though, I was fairly disappointed."
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","Probably when I saw Veil of Maya, Structures, Northlane, Vildhjarta, and Here Comes the Kraken about at year ago. Every band that night absolutely killed it. I'm also glad I got to see VoM before Brandon left, Northlane before Adrian left, and Structures before they broke up."

I saw Veil of Maya, After the Burial, Misery Signals, Within the Ruins, Your Memorial play together on the Crush Em All II Tour.

I saw Meshuggah and Between the Buried and Me on Meshuggah's 25th Anniversary Tour.

I saw Conducting from the Grave, Molotov Solution, MyChildren MyBride, The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza, and Suicide Silence on the No Time to Bleed Tour.

I saw Counterparts and the original Misery Signals lineup (with a surprise 7 Angels 7 Plagues mini-reunion with all of the original members, but also all three vocalists from across 7A7P's career, in MS and 7A7P's hometown) on the Malice X tour.

I saw Rings of Saturn, Thy Art is Murder, Periphery, Animals as Leaders, The Dillinger Escape Plan, and Cattle Decapitation at Summer Slaughter 2013.

I saw Attila, For the Fallen Dreams, The Crimson Armada and Chelsea Grin on some tour that I forgot the name of when I was in high school.

I saw Within the Ruins, After the Burial, Glass Cloud, and The Contortionist my freshman year of college.

I saw Veil of Maya, Volumes, and Upon a Burning Body on the tour they did where The Acacia Strain was headlining but dropped, but Volumes was underwhelming, and it was the absolute worst Veil of Maya show I have ever seen (I've seen them like 5 times, including before they released The Common Man's Collapse). I haven't seen them since, because Marc is getting sloppy, and lazy. Almost all of the leads were on a backing track, and he was pretty much just playing chugs the entire time, and kept drifting out of time (even though they were playing to a click). Also their setlist was pretty lame. All songs from Eclipse, except Unbreakable and It's Not Safe to Swim Today. UABB fucking killed it though."
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","Veil of Maya, The Contortionist, Glass Cloud, with local openers. Mostly because The Contortionist. It was after Jonathan left though, which bums me out, but they played Vessel and Oscillator and I lost my fucking mind."
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","For deathcore, Summer Slaughter 2014. The deathcore bands playing were The Faceless, Thy Art Is Murder, Within the Ruins, Fallujah, and a couple of pretty good local bands. For my bast concert overall, It was a lineup of Periphery, The Contortionist, Intervals, and Toothgrinder. I had gotten a lesson from Matt Halpern before the show, and was front row during it."
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","My favorite was probably the Upon A Burning Body, Thy Art Is Murder, As Blood Runs Black, The Color Morale (know Hope album cycle so it was good), Fit For An Autopsy, I Declare War, and Last 10 Seconds of Life. 

Really wild show. "
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","I have a couple. 

I saw Suicide Silence with The Faceless before they made planetary duality. Nile was also there but they were boring. Mitch had CRAZY stage presence. Made for a fun show. 

The Acacia Strain at the St. Pete warped tour a couple years ago was fucking brutal. ""I AM THE END OF THE WORLD."" and then people die. You know, the usual! 

And then in December I'll be going to the Emmure, The Acacia Strain and Stray From The Path show in Tampa so that should top the list. "
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","I like Suicide Silence and The Faceless, but I'm kind of surprised to hear that Nile was boring. The Acacia Strain was great when I saw them a couple of years ago... I would definitely do it again."
"What is the best show that you've ever been to?","Yeah it's weird cause well.... I like Nile. But they were just a freaking drag live. I don't know why. "

"2015 Album Of The Year is Rings Of Saturn - Lugal Ki En","It lacked substance in my opinion, on paper the album is technical and aggressive, but there was little atmosphere and they lost any feel to the music because they were too focused on wankery"
"2015 Album Of The Year is Rings Of Saturn - Lugal Ki En","The atmosphere was kind of wasted in the first two songs on the record. After that they just kinda recycled the low end and like you said, wanked."
"2015 Album Of The Year is Rings Of Saturn - Lugal Ki En","Lugal Ki En was a great album, musically they took it to the next level.  Although what Luke Griffin from Acrania is doing with his vocals is well worth a mention.

"Hellsworth EP By Honest Crooks",""
"Hellsworth EP By Honest Crooks","It shows a ridiculous amount of promise, but there's something about the vocals that really puts me off. The meat of his growls is awesome, but when he has to swell into the full force of it every time it gets really hard to listen to.

The feature from Rheese is the best part of this. Almost sounds like Mike Greenwood."

"Thirteen Bled Promises - One Semester Of Spanish Death Song","The vocals on this album are my favorite ever. Especially those highs."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)",""
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","instrumental is great, brings the junz. vocals are solid. I think his highs are pretty good, but his lows could use some work. much prefer the growls of Brandon than the metalcore-y lows of the new guy. "
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","He's definitely different than Brandon, but I still think he sounds great! I'm excited for this album."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Incoming some random thoughts about the track + a rant about modern metal mixes:


The grooves are really good.

The bass has a lot of presence in the mix.

The kick has some balls (first time since TCMC).

The mix has a ton of energy w/o being a wall of shit (see: Structures /).  Reminds me a lot of The Discovery by BOO.  

The new guy isn't as brutal as Brandon was.  Still good though.  Those BGVs were nice during the break.

Tasty riff choices by Marc

Echoing what some Youtuber said, this song lost that raw feel from TCMC because Keene's productions at the time (Pretty sure this applies to Autotheism, too) don't feature sampled drums and we're now listening to 2015 hyper-compressed sampled/super perfect [&amp; probably] quantized drums.  A big factor here, too, is the style of mixing: pushing the RMS levels, as opposed to leaving it more 'organic' (dynamic).  

It's a matter of taste - some people prefer the TCMC/[id] style mixes vs. The modern super polished djentcore.  I personally enjoy both styles. However, the artform in the mix IMO is: 

* a. making the organic mix sound so dynamic and punchy, that you don't mind that it's not totally sampled/super high RMS mixing.  TCMC does this, so does The Faceless' Planetary Duality. 
* b. making the modern mix sound real.  Circle of Contempt's Artifacts In Motion is a nice example of this.  

Most go for the polished sound but don't put too much effort to make it sound real (see: Latest BOO album) 


Overall, I really enjoyed listening to the song and I'm happy that I have an album to look forward to from one of my favorite bands


TL:DR Nice groove + nice harmonic minor riffs + punchy drums  = good listen

e: nice bass arp @ 3:03 I didn't catch on the first couple listens"
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Hate to be that guy but the Common Man's Collapse's drums were all programmed. Same as Born of Osiris' ""the New Reign"" EP, aswell as The Faceless' ""Akeldama"" EP (all produced by Keene around the same time)

The drums in Pheonix are live and not quantised, just heavily processed. It was engineered by Diego from Volumes. Diego is an absolute beast at producing the big,  heavily compressed mixes, as is evident in Subject Zero, and both Volumes' &amp; Chelsea Grin's latest albums."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","&gt;the Common Man's Collapse's drums were all programmed. Same as Born of Osiris' ""the New Reign"" EP, aswell as The Faceless' ""Akeldama"" EP (all produced by Keene around the same time)

How do you know this?"
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Not Akeldama but Keene said that the drums in Planetary Duality were natural but were just overcompressed and he regrets it."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Tomorrow we die alive was pretty good imo :/"
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","The part around 1:20? kinda reminds me of Complex Terms by The Human Abstract. "
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","It's been killing me since the first listen. My mind kept wandering towards that riff, but I couldn't name where it was from.

It kind of sounds similar, but not enough for me to think of plagiarism. This stuff happens some times."

"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Instrumental is pretty good, but Brandon's vocals blow this out of the water."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","This song sounds more Metalcore for sure. "
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","The lyrics are 3deep5me. 

The song could have been 40 seconds long, and it would have left the same impression. 

Way to repetitive, not interesting enough, and there is too much open chugging. 

I like the screamer a lot more, though. "
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","EXACTLY. the song was boring. I expect way more from VoM. Marc isn't writing as many riffs. Just boring chugs. "
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","This is only one song, wait for the album to determine if he isn't writing as many riffs anymore"
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","I agree, but I haven't been impressed with their stuff since TCMC and id"
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Better than I was expecting."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","I'm alright with the new vocalist. Not too big on his lows but that's just because I like Brandon's more. 

I love me some of them Okubo riffs. 

Interested to see what they come out with next."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Lyrics are repetitive, everything else is perfect."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Except vocals"
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Hopefully this is one of the more metalcorey songs, not that its bad but, would like to see some technical prowess that im used from these guys."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","I liked everything including the new vocals, although I feel the old vocals were way better. It's just that the song is too repetitive, I hope the rest of the album is more technical and progressive. Otherwise, pretty sweet."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","And I need new boxers."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","This band hasn't progressed enough for my taste. I'll stick to what I know and like, TCMC and id.

"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","first Make them Suffer now Veil, how disappointing "
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Make them suffers song was good though :-/"
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","The vocals as sooo much better than the last douche's."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but what made Brandon a douche? I've met him after shows and he's always been the nicest guy."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Doesn't give out high fives in between songs. Marc however, coolest fuckin guy. Makes raptor faces while playing and shit."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","As someone who has met both of them numerous times, Brandon is actually one of the nicest guys I've ever met (Danny is actually the nicest member of VoM though), and Marc has been a huge douchebag every time I've met him. Marc *always* gives his fans the cold shoulder after shows. When I see VoM, I don't even try to talk to him after the show anymore. Last time I saw them, I walked up to him, and said, ""Hey Marc, you guys played great tonight!"" and he literally just turned around and walked away. But Brandon and Danny always drink a crapload of beer with me and talk baseball and shit (Danny's a Cardinals fan, Brandon's a Cubs fan, always makes for a fun conversation, especially when I watched Game 7 of the 2011 World Series with them, because I'm a Cardinals fan too). But yeah, Brandon is super nice. Sad to see him out of VoM."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Huh. I've met them before and Marc was nice. Got a picture with him after the show and he talked to me for a bit. They were all nice dudes, signed my poster and CD that I bought. This was in like 2012 though."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","The first time I saw them was right around when Brandon joined. I'm jealous that Marc was nice to you though. His guitar playing was very influential on me, so it was a huge bummer to basically be 100% ignored by one of my guitar idols. He was even like that back when they were playing at bars and record stores and shit in my area before TCMC dropped, which sucks."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","I think it all depends on whats going on when you meet them. Sometimes they're in a rush to pack up and stuff. 

I met Misha Mansoor after a show one time. I tried to talk to him but he just said he was in a rush and left right away without talking. I was pretty disappointed. But i've talked to him other times after that and he was nice, so I guess it all depends on the circumstances. 

Oh and I also met Jason Richardson once (during Chelsea Grin era) and he wouldn't talk to me."
"Veil of Maya- Phoenix (NEW SONG!!!)","Yeah, Jason isn't talkative either. He wouldn't talk to me in BoO or CG. As a musician though, that just pisses me off.

"Hey! So I'm new to this whole death core thing! Help me out with some bands?","So, I'm not new to extreme metal, I got into extreme forms of metal (death metal, metalcore, etc.) when I was 17, I'm 18 now, but I'm very new to deathcore! 

So, the reason I got into deathcore is after hearing As Blood Runs Black's album Allegiance. Fuuuuuuuckkkk, that album is metal. 

Anywho, I want deathcore in that style. Melodic metal is my favorite type, with lots of harmonies. With lots of chugging but with melody, not just straight chugging. The song ""In Dying Days"" is a good example of what I'm talking about. 

So, think you can help a fellow metal head out? "

I recommend that you set aside some time and listen to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z63ibEssozg) in one sitting. It's long but it sums up their sound really well. 

I'd also recommend The Contortionist's album [Exoplanet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GGPFioA8Wc). Their more recent albums are prog metal, but this one is a seamless fusion of proper deathcore and progressive melodies. I'm into post-rock as well so that may be why I like this particular sound so much. "

"Artist Of The month - Nomination For March","For the next ~3 days we will have this nomination thread open. Then we will take the top 5 nominations and create a new final voting thread which will last another ~3 days in order to determine the Artist of the Month for March.

This thread will be set to contest mode, meaning that scores will be hidden and all nominations will be randomized on each refresh.

**How this works:**

1) Make your nominations for Artist of the Month in this thread. Include a song/album by the artist if possible, and nothing else. Follow this format: **[Band Name](link)**

*Like this: [Dealey Plaza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfeICw8b9Z0)*

2) Upvote the artists that you want to see make it to the final voting round (Downvotes will not count against an artist, the only thing that matters are the amount of upvotes an artist gets)

3) DO NOT NOMINATE AN ARTIST THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN NOMINATED IN THIS THREAD! Please review what has been posted and just upvote the person that nominated them already.

4) 2 band nominations per person limit!

The artist that wins will have a CSS theme dedicated to them for the month. Start nominating and voting on who you want to see make it to the final round!

 Also how did you come about having 3 guitarists? "
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","We got three guitarists to try and replicate the album live. Chris plays a lot of lead parts throughout the songs and it allows us to make sure the rhythm section still sounds full. "

My highs have always been my strong point because of my older band. Deep vocals have been a new thing for me since I joined Aversions. For warm ups I use the zen of screaning/ Melissa cross warm ups :)"

"G'day we're Aversions Crown","I've been a fan since the EP and have watched the band's rise and evolution
You guy's keep refining your sound better and better with every album.
At first I thought having 3 guitarists was silly, but when I saw you guys live having 3 guitarists and a very solid bass player makes some of the heaviest music I have ever heard live.
How did you guys start using kemper profiling amps live and what are the advantages and disadvantages?"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","We decided to get the Kempers to make touring easier. They're great sounding amps and are really practical. They've got a realistic valve sound and have a built in power amp. "
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","I see you guys used your own PA monitors on stage but if you guys desired you could plug directly into the front of house right?"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Yeah man absolutely. We can just run the Kempers straight into the PA.  We use our own speakers for our on stage foldback. "
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","First and foremost, you guys are absolutely amazing. I've been listening to your music basically everyday since I first discovered you just over a year ago. I attribute all of my PR's in the gym to the menacing breakdowns and fierce lyrical content of Servitude and the singles released off Tyrant. Gives me shivers and gets me in the fucking zone. Seriously just such a huge fan, the images you portray with your music are beyond apocalyptic and mind blowing. Tyrant was everything I had hoped for and my hype level was reaching near insanity waiting for it. Excellent work bros and thank you.... Anyways, questions. 1) Where do you draw the majority of your influence from lyrically as well as musically?  2) Favourite sci-fi book/movie/series/video game? 3) Favourite band or artist? 4) What do you guys do for day jobs (if you have them) and to add on that question what other passions do you have next to music and if you weren't professional musicians what would you wish for a career? 5) Is kangaroo meat really as good as everyone tells me? ....

"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Great answer! Behemoth pretty much got me into more extreme music. I caught them in Vancouver with Watain a couple years ago and their live show was absolutely monstrous!! Been a HUGE fan of Michael Keene and the Faceless since Akheldama, the man fucking shreds. "
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","1) cheers for the props dude, a lot of my influence for lyrics came from a super wide variety of sci-fi films, video games and documentaries. The ideas and themes explored on the tyrant album can't really be nailed down to one specific source, they were born from the experiences of everything in my life, I developed different ideas and beliefs over time that don't necessarily correlate with any one source. The themes on the album are made up from things I believe to be real mixed with things that I'm afraid of.

"G'day we're Aversions Crown","What was it like working with Andy marsh? Was it just for the one song? "
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","It was good... the vocals were recorded with Nick carpenter and bass was tracked with our good friend Adam Merker, then it was all finished up with mark lewis at Audio hammer we are absolutley stoked with the end result."
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Sweet! The production and quality of the new album is pretty excellent. Would have been costly, did you guys pay for it fully or? How much does an album like that cost approx? Really just curious "
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Just listened to Tyrant, fucking rad. You guys have plans to tour the US anytime soon?"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Thanks mate! Yeah we can't wait to get over there. There's been word of heading over there for your spring. "
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","What are you doing for V Loud? "
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Doing a takeover, spinning some of our favourite tracks and talking about the album, should be live in a few weeks"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Are you guys going to tour in America, New York or New Jersey any time soon?? I really wanna see you guys live, BTW new album is sick!"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Spring is the word homie, hopefully it goes ahead"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","If you were to do a galactic tour, playing to crowds across different planets, then what 3 bands would you want to go on the tour with? Btw I had an awesome time seeing you guys with Thy art is murder and Heart of a coward in Hamburg :)"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Hey guys


Do you have plans to tour smaller, lesser mapped places like South Africa? Would be mad to finally see a quality metal band! Otherwise how are you all enjoying life on tour? 
"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Holy fuck how didn't I know this happened, dammed work. You guys are fucking amazing. Loved every song and album you've put out."
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","When I heard you guys for the first time, I aggressively ejaculated all over my room.... "
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","whats your theory about aliens and humans on earth?
"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","They are here, among us."
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","dude, thats deep. does the guitarist miss signal at all? i was bummed they split up. coming to see you in melbs on sat"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Will you guys come to Norway?!"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Any chance of coming over to the NZ anytime soon?"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","That would be sick, we have never really had an offer, what are the shows like?"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","I'm more into hardcore personally but i do check out the occasional deathcore gig, the gigs range a lot from everyone standing/siting noding their head, to some good moshing. 

I am 17, so I've been only to all ages gig but the best gigs mosh wise was die die die and desperate models who are neither heavy. While going to a pretty much metalcore gig nobody was doing anything but two hardcore dancers.

if you know you got a good fan base here the gig would be sick otherwise you'd probably want to tour with someone who does have a good one. 

Venues are pretty cheap too, I'd say.

it looks like at some bars"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Listened to that new As Blood Runs Black today and turned it off to listen to Tyrant instead. Meaty meaty. Now how much of those drums are fake, cause holy fuck. Also, met a Brisbane woman the other day and she was super noice. Represent."
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Thats sick man.
The drums are not fake we spent a good while recording them."
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","That's awesome to hear. Love you guys' shit as well as the lot of Australian death metal."
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Aww come on. Didn't expect this to be that early, are you guys still online?"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Just logged back in Brah. What's up"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Awesome, glad I didn't miss this after all. So I find the alien-themed element a great idea and so far every song reflects and expresses that pretty well. My question is do you guys plan on keeping this element for the next releases?"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Definitely, it's a comfortable subject for us and we haven't said all we wanted to say."
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","That's a pretty solid thing to hear. I really support the progress of a band over time, but the lyrical and the base concept is something I like to see stay unaffected. Plus it was about time more ""aliens"" appeared in the metal scene, looking forward to see you live in January."
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Notice me please?"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Do you miss the other local bands, such as ""The Red Shore"", or ""Signal The Firing Squad""? (I assume that any of you guys listen to them)"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","In the glass sentient at about 2:42 what noise is triggering with the kick that sounds like a hollow pulse rifle shot?"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Why did you choose the alien deathcore element as your main focus as opposed to other genres?"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","It's something we are all interested in, a lot of bands are singing about Satan, or hatred, we just felt comfortable singing about what we like"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Besides deathcore, what else do you guys listen to? 
What artists have you been/are influenced by? 
Made a subreddit for Helm a while ago, you guys wanna be moderators? r/helmband
Do you like cheesecake? 

In 1932 there was a war in WA, the Great Emu War.  A war with emus. Yes, a legit historical event. What are the chances that event will be mentioned in your next album? 

"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Long live the warriors of the emu war. a really inspiring artist to us is Lorde. I think the fact that she is the leader of the kiwi army who fought alongside the emu army is very inspiring.  She is also a very good geologist.  Yayaya I am lorde. Yayaya. "
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","If only the studios wouldn't have messed with her version of the Hunger Games theme :/"
"G'day we're Aversions Crown","Haven't watched that SP episode yet, so that just went well over my head. Try again. "

"Monsters - Death Is Irreversible","I remember this EP!  I thought it was really wicked.  I thought they were really going to go somewhere.  I wasn't a huge fan of what they put out after - it kind of had too much of that weird thing that Frankie Palmeri does with his voice.  Then, unfortunately, they broke up.

Do you know if any of their members went on to do anything cool?"
"Monsters - Death Is Irreversible","As far as I know, nope. During their reunion tour with Oceano in 2013 they dedicated their set as a fuck you to Frankie Palmeri though, so I guess there's some bad blood there. "

"Can't find any similar bands...Any suggestions?","Hello! This is my first time posting here, so I don't know if this is the right place or not. 

I found a band a little while back, and I really like their style of deathcore. The band is called Upon a Red Sky. Here are some links: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQTm_pOIctE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvKXsWkjiCo

I'm not a massive fan of many of the -core genres, but I like some deathcore. Stuff like Upon a Red Sky and Aegaeon. Lots of growls, not so much scream, not many freaky sounds (pig squeals, etc.), heavy mastering, and very frantic breakdowns (like lots of notes very close together and spastically). I could just be being really picky here, I don't know :P

If anyone has any bands that are similar to Upon a Red Sky, I would be interested in looking them up :) cheers!"
"Can't find any similar bands...Any suggestions?","You might like old Knights of the Abyss. Also Brother Von Doom, no one listens to them, and they are awesome. Old Suffokate. Depths of Hatred (probably from their earlier material, check the song Revocation). Sorry if these are off base, I get a similar vibe from them as I do from Upon a Red Sky."

"Miles Dimitri Baker, the new guitarist for Rings of Saturn is killing it - Peeling Arteries Playthrough | No Guitar Pro, no half speed","Would anyone mind explaining how the ""tapping"" works? I have never thought about it that much but I find it hard to believe that tapping the strings can produce those sounds"
"Miles Dimitri Baker, the new guitarist for Rings of Saturn is killing it - Peeling Arteries Playthrough | No Guitar Pro, no half speed","It does.  Tapping on the string makes the string vibrate, thus the sound you hear when tapping."
"Miles Dimitri Baker, the new guitarist for Rings of Saturn is killing it - Peeling Arteries Playthrough | No Guitar Pro, no half speed","It's a bunch of Hammer on's and Pull off's mixed with tapping. Combining it all really fast in a sequence while executing it well results in that sound. 

EDIT: It really sounds way harder than it is to execute. If your a really accurate player you can pick it up in no time."
"Miles Dimitri Baker, the new guitarist for Rings of Saturn is killing it - Peeling Arteries Playthrough | No Guitar Pro, no half speed","alright, I guess I just don't know guitar very well "
"Miles Dimitri Baker, the new guitarist for Rings of Saturn is killing it - Peeling Arteries Playthrough | No Guitar Pro, no half speed","Calluses. 

Big fucking calluses. You can't do it with soft pussy hands. 

Your fingers have to *bleed* from tapping, and only then can you get a good tone out of it. 

Also, another important factor is in your string and tone choice. If you're going super bright nickel wound with 10-treble/0-mid/10-bass/10-distortion then you're not going to get a good tone for shit.

But like most things in guitar, it's all about practice. I can tap really well now, because my guitar's fretboard has seen more than its fair share of blood. 

I'm being over-dramatic, but that's essentially the idea behind it."

"Miles Dimitri Baker, the new guitarist for Rings of Saturn is killing it - Peeling Arteries Playthrough | No Guitar Pro, no half speed","I cant be the only one who thinks this band sounds like a bunch of pointless guitar wanking. Its the kind of shit you hear being played by a smelly guy with a ponytail at guitar center, constantly looking over his shoulder to see if people are looking at him and his 666 sick shredz. Just because its complicated and fast, and yes, hard to play, doesnt mean it has any kind of musicality."

&gt;Mainly because why not? Originally when we ""got together"", we were throwing around all these stupid ""spr srs"" deathcore band names like ""Eden In Ruins"" and ""Gaia Aflame"" and stuff of that ilk, but Jonas had put together a placeholder logo (using a font similar to a certain band on Sumerian Records with a fondness for aliens...) that just said ""SLICE THE CAKE"", and we figured it was a solid option. Plus, band names in this sort of music are getting beyond ridiculous with the amount of near-identical patterns, that soon we're just going to run out of combinations of ""metal"" sounding words. The logical conclusion is that we'll end up with stuff like ""Slice the Cake"" and ""Toast the Bread"", so we ran with it. Oh, and of course, because ""it's all about the music, maaaaaan."""

"Can someone explain the love behind Acrania's vocalist?","I mean I just really don't get. Pig squeals haven't been cool since I was in middle school and his gutturals and screams are generic. He almost sounds like a parody of extreme vocals. Someone change my mind. 

For reference, my favorite vocalists

1) Ian from ROS

2) Vincent

3) Luke (I think?) from Black Tongue"
"Can someone explain the love behind Acrania's vocalist?","I'll take a stab at it, being that he's my favorite vocalist. 


For me at least, it's the speed combined with the timing of the vocals. It's unique and very enjoyable. This in addition to the fact that I actually love his highs and pig squeals in combination with the lows. They may not be ""cool"" but I enjoy them. 

Basically all I'm saying can be summed up in [the end](http://youtu.be/wFEaVM3VLdc?t=2m55s) of one of their songs.

Edit: [better example of vocal range](http://youtu.be/iymIQ0iQloA?t=5m)"

"Can someone explain the love behind Acrania's vocalist?","I like how fast he can go, but that's about it. If you've listened to any actual Brutal Death, you won't really think his vocals are all that brutal.

In an art form clouded with brutality, sometimes the absurd is what stands out the most."
"Can someone explain the love behind Acrania's vocalist?","I agree. I've never understood the hype behind Luke Griffin. 

Also, Black Tongue's vocalist is Alex Teyen."
"Can someone explain the love behind Acrania's vocalist?","I can't really argue against you about Acrania's vocalist, I've never been huge on vocals anyways, but I do prefer deep vocals overall. I also happened to be listening to ROS when I read your post, and I've always thought Ian's growling was fantastic."
"Can someone explain the love behind Acrania's vocalist?","How can you say his vocals are generic and then go on to name Vincent and Alex Teyen as your favorite vocalists. I like them too but let's be honest here both vocalists you listed aren't winning any awards for their vocal range, and both have pretty generic vocals. Acrania's vocalist arguably has the most range of anyone else I can find in the genre currently, you just don't like gutterals and pig squeals (which have been around for a while and never left). If you want to listen to just lows-mid vocals go listen to the tough guy down tempo trend happening lately that will probably fade out in the next couple of years because there doesn't seem to be much variation between bands."
"Can someone explain the love behind Acrania's vocalist?","Read my post again. I'm not denying his range, I just said his gutturals and screams have no power and sounds generic. It sounds like he can't find what he likes best so it all just comes out flat and boring. "

&gt;Acrania is a rare congenital disorder that occurs in the human fetus in which the flat bones in the cranial vault are either completely or partially absent. The cerebral hemispheres develop completely but abnormally. The condition is frequently, though not always, associated with anencephaly. The fetus is said to suffer from acrania if it meets the following criteria: the fetus should have a perfectly normal facial bone, a normal cervical column but without the fetal skull and a volume of brain tissue equivalent to at least one third of the normal brain size."

Edit: ""Hey guys, let's downvote this dude because he has an opinion! That'll change his mind!""

**Spite**- Deathcore with the most deranged vocals I've ever heard- their song 'Psychopath' is a great example.

**Blind Oracle**- Sounds like Rings of Saturn crossed with Betraying the Martyrs. Also, from Australia!  

**Flesh of the Earth**- great technical deathcore with a really interesting lyrical topic- nature overtaking the earth."

"Biggest deathcore thread. Need new suggestions as well.","Wow, you're missing all of my top 3 favorite bands/albums ever

1) [Thirteen Bled Promises - Heliopause Fleets (brutal deathcore)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nicL1eOQURc)

2) [As Blood Runs Black - Allegiance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quoo-cVeOKU)

3) [And Hell Followed With - Proprioception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE_qsN6lr5w)

**edit** Lorna Shore is up there in my top 5 as well. Rings of Saturn rounds out my top 5 favorite bands (although you already mentioned both of them)

**edit2:** Also I read that you don't really like slam too much, but I must recommend [Abominable Putridity - The Anomalies of Artificial Origin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JYFgoaEeaQ). That album is by far the best the genre has to offer in my opinion."
"Biggest deathcore thread. Need new suggestions as well.","Thirteen Bled Promises, checked them out and it's fucking grand! Thanks for the suggestion!

ABRB are good, I had a quick sus at their albums and Allegiance is better than their newest one!

Tried Abominable Putridity, didn't enjoy it, I'm not a fan of ""brutal death"", I love Ingested and Acrania for their deathcore elements.

Thanks heaps for the suggestions!"
"Biggest deathcore thread. Need new suggestions as well.","yeah 13BP has probably my favorite vocals in the genre

im also just a sucker for all the [long segments of blastbeats/tremolo picking](http://youtu.be/nicL1eOQURc?t=35m29s) that they do

ABRBs allegiance album has a decent amount of that too "
"Biggest deathcore thread. Need new suggestions as well.","I'll give 13BP's album a proper listen soon!

"The Breathing Process - Treasonist","Here's a band that I forgot about.  They played some pretty good symphonic deathcore with some nice breakdowns sprinkled through out.  Both albums were pretty damn good.  Killer band."
"The Breathing Process - Treasonist","I toured with these guys in like 2007, and have remained friends through the years. They're all doing different stuff now, but The Breathing Process was a force to be reckoned with for a hot minute. It's funny that just last night I was thinking about digging out my copy of In Waking, and I get on Reddit today and someones talking about them. "
"The Breathing Process - Treasonist","You said you toured with them.  Were you in a band?  Or currently in one?"
"The Breathing Process - Treasonist","I was in a band called A Girl A Gun A Ghost. We played more hardcore than metal for sure, but they were one of the bands we did a DIY tour with, and they ended up helping us get signed to Siege Of Amida back in the Whitechapel days. It was a great experience, especially when Siege joined with Ferret. We recorded a rap album with them in their guitarists basement in Connecticut haha. They are interesting dudes. "

"[Discussion] OG has been out for a while now. What do you think about the album?","Love it, it's a little cringey at times but that contributes to the appeal for me. I tend to gravitate to bands who don't take themselves too seriously. Also think that while they don't add much, the trap/hip hop elements are well placed and not overdone. Definitely more emphasis on melodic verses than in FSU, which isn't bad."
"[Discussion] OG has been out for a while now. What do you think about the album?","It's fun. It's what Attila should be. 

The intro to Sour D is fucking great. I wish it had more of the trap moments. And the random Rings of Saturn-ish weedly bit in Sohar Azul I: Visionary. I like the line ""I""m not the devil, do you see me wearin' prada?"". 

The rapping could use some work though. Both the screamed rapping and clean rapping. "
"[Discussion] OG has been out for a while now. What do you think about the album?","Exactly how I feel. Saud is an amazing vocalist, but so is Fronz. They chose to go a similar route, but I feel Attila missed the mark while The Holy Guile nailed it. "

"Deathcore with a lot of tremolo picking?","Hello, ive noticed that deathcore (or any metal really) with a lot of tremolo picking gives me the biggest eargasms, even more so than a good breakdown. One of my favorite bands that did this a lot was As Blood Runs Black (in their first album at least)

[As Blood Runs Black - In Dying Days](http://youtu.be/sdU_pT0KXSI?t=2m41s)

[As Blood Runs Black - Legends Never Die](http://youtu.be/cF4OqYUD690?t=1m33s)

[As Blood Runs Black - Strife](http://youtu.be/LN5Uy9u1DLk?t=24s)

[Job For A Cowboy - Relinquished](http://youtu.be/LgOqqCl2f1w?t=28s)

I hope you get the point by now. Anyways, I was just wondering if you guys could direct me to some bands/albums that have this shit everywhere (such as ABRB's Allegiance album)

**edit:** and I pray to moonjesus that this is actually what tremolo picking is. I don't play the guitar so i'm not 100% confident in my ability to not embarrass myself here

if its not tremolo picking, at least you understand what im talking about now haha 

**edit 2:** BTW I should say that you don't have to recommend me only deathcore bands/albums. I love any metal with this stuff in it, ESPECIALLY the more evil sound that goes along with deathcore and blackmetal (I think these examples were played in the minor scale? .. again im not a guitar guy im not sure) The only reason I know about 'scales' is because of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq8ODuozdIo) hilarious video. 

"
"Deathcore with a lot of tremolo picking?","Epiphany From The Abyss, Lorna Shore, Infant Annihilator, older Whitechapel, AngelMaker, Through the Eyes of the Dead, ...And Hell Followed With, A Night In Texas, older Thy Art Is Murder, Hester Prynne, Into Infernus, Lorelei, Make The Suffer, and In Chasms Deep.

And I guess, Anaal Nathrakh. If you can stomach black/grind."
"Deathcore with a lot of tremolo picking?","wow thanks for the big list. Ill be sure to check out anything I haven't already listened to. 

"
"Deathcore with a lot of tremolo picking?","Thy Art Is Murder"
"Deathcore with a lot of tremolo picking?","I feel the exact same way you do. Check out With Blood Comes Cleansing. They have two albums. Sadly, they are not making new music anymore to my knowledge, but their two albums sounds like satan walking into a catholic church to sacrifice a virgin with angels around the ceilings and demons around the alter.... yeah, like that. 

- [With Blood Comes Cleansing - Horror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPD7FI5C5gs).

"Deathcore with a lot of tremolo picking?","wow, that is **EXACTLY** what I was looking for. I fucking love it. 

edit: I don't know if this is true or not, but it seems like this is more common in a lot of 'older' deathcore albums (like pre-09ish). Everything is so djenty these days. "
"Deathcore with a lot of tremolo picking?","I feel like that is an accurate statement from what I've found looking for that type of feeling. Check out [The Blood Countess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-kBH6KR2AM) too. This song not as much, but the whole album has that vibe. Couldn't find the full album on youtube right now. They have a very With Blood Comes Cleansing type vibe. 

Another good band you might like that does this is [Resist the Thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hodh_Le7V2k). This song is almost solely tremolo picking for the full intro and first verse. Listen to this full CD and you'll find what you are looking for too. 

If you are into music in general, listen to Daniel Barenboim play Chopin's Noturnes. It is all piano, but it is very dark, morose, and melancholy. He was a romantic composer so if you like this general type of sound, check out all romantic composer and some baroque composers really do a good job of capturing that vibe too.

Bands like: Slice the Cake, Winds of Plague, Lorelei, Ovids Withering, The HAARP Machine, even Dimmu Borgir and Fleshgod Apocalypse and The Black Dahlia Murder all use symphonic music with death metal and -core influences and might be up your alley.

Also, no cleans because I can't sing worth shit but my band [Plaguebringer](https://plaguebringercanada.bandcamp.com) also does melodic deathcore with some symphonic and classical influences too! You might like that too."

MTS is fucking awesome."
"I'm not a fan of most deathcore, but I can't get enough of Make Them Suffer. What are some similar bands?","I think it's the emotion. Their instrumentals are so heavenly, it's insane. They're like a blend of deathcore and melodic hardcore. "
"I'm not a fan of most deathcore, but I can't get enough of Make Them Suffer. What are some similar bands?","Their newest single is quite the opposite of awesome. The lyrics are a little ooey gooey for Deathcore, and he doesn't sing the same. It's also got none of the same atmosphere."

They just released their first new song in 5 years titled DM but their old stuff is very good too.

"I'm not a fan of most deathcore, but I can't get enough of Make Them Suffer. What are some similar bands?","I can't think of many bands labelled as ""Deathcore"" that sound like Make Them Suffer, the combination of the brutal style with softer and more melodic parts is rather hard to match. The closest band that I can think of is the Metalcore band ""Architects"". Some of their heavier songs (try listening to ""Follow The Water"" and ""Alpha Omega"") have a similar sound to them, and they also combine quiet melodic parts, with great vocals and heavy breakdowns, whilst still retaining the ""Metalcore"" label. That's the closest that I can think of, give 'em a listen and see what you think. "

So far I feel it's just kind of okay.  The thing that kills it for me is the cleans.  There are so many killer brutal sections on this album. Then they throw in the clean vox and it just kills the mood a bit.  So what do you think?  "
"The new As Blood Runs Black. Thoughts?","I loved it. The instruments all sounded fantastic and the riffs were great. I liked the cleans myself. 

It's the fourth best Deathcore album I've heard this year (Lugal Ki En is # 1, then Phenomena, then Lore of Lies) and in my overall top 10 for the year (~#7 - #8). "
"The new As Blood Runs Black. Thoughts?","I agree wholeheartedly that the riffs and instrumentation were absolutely fantastic on this one.(Also agreed on Lugal Ki En(holy shit just holy shit on that album.))"
"The new As Blood Runs Black. Thoughts?","Yeah. It's pretty much what I want out of a Deathcore album."
"The new As Blood Runs Black. Thoughts?","Meh. I was never a big fan of As Blood Runs Black (here come the down votes...), but I decided to give this and their other albums a listen, and I just wasn't all that impressed by them. 

They're alright musically, but they're just not my cup of tea, I suppose."

I really hope they go places cause they are such a good band and the members are really awesome and cool with the fans. I've talked to the bassist at a show and he's really cool, Tom(vocals) is really chill with the fans asking for pictures and asking questions. I wanted to get a full band autograph when I saw them like a week ago but their were too many people asking for pictures and I found amazement in watching Tom calmly deal with all the people and the hectic fans asking for merch. I really hope I do get a full band autograph cause I went Lorna Shore to be my first autograph! :)

"And Hell Followed With - Serpents Beneath Their Hoods [Remixed &amp; Remastered for the first time from their 2008 release ""Domain""]","From the bands facebook/bandcamp pages:

&gt; The first AHFW album Domain (2008) was marred by series of unwanted edits and decisions by the band's label at the time, ultimately resulting in the release of an album that did not sound the way they wanted it to and causing the band to distance themselves from the album and its material. 
&gt; 
&gt; In 2010, the idea was briefly discussed of remixing and remastering the album and releasing someday down the road. The project was ultimately abandoned, but one track was remixed and has never been shown or released until now. This is an idea of what Domain could have sounded like."

"And Hell Followed With - Serpents Beneath Their Hoods [Remixed &amp; Remastered for the first time from their 2008 release ""Domain""]","God, I hope they honestly do remaster it.

"Enterprise Earth - 23 2014 [FULL EP]",""
"Return From Exile - Destroying the Evolution of a Shallow Existence",""
"Return From Exile - Destroying the Evolution of a Shallow Existence","Found this band in my suggestions in Spotify.  Wow.  This is some seriously killer, shreddy, brutal stuff right here.  The melodic guitar work on it is just so fantastic.  Couple that with some brutal breakdowns, this makes for a very killer listen.  It sounds like it culls a lot from As Blood Runs Black's Allegiance, and All Shall Perish's The Price of Existence(which makes sense as both albums came up 3 years before.).  Definitely not bad.  "
"Return From Exile - Destroying the Evolution of a Shallow Existence","Also sounds like Nocturnal Bloodlust's last EP, japanese deathcore/metalcore."
"Return From Exile - Destroying the Evolution of a Shallow Existence","Oh never heard of them.   Going to check them out.  "
"Return From Exile - Destroying the Evolution of a Shallow Existence","Don't let their costumes scare you away, went way less heavy recently with more melodic stuff.  
[One of their heaviest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wJUnHKIugM)  
[More melodic, sickest song, the breakdowns are nuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY4FgIzsWNQ)"

"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Hi /r/Deathcore,

I'm a huge metalcore/post-hardcore fan and I want to get my tastes a little more extreme. Some bands I like are Bullet For My Valentine, Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, Trivium, In Flames. I like screaming vocals with a mixture of clean vocals too, but I don't think I'll find too much clean vocals in deathcore, right?

Eh, yeah, so please, what's a good band/album to start with to get into deathcore? I'd like to possibly see all of the different aspects of deathcore – tempo changes, key changes ^(?), experimental instruments, etc.

*(Also, if you could provide a YouTube link to the song/album, I'd great appreciate it!)*

Thanks!

*EDIT*: Thanks everyone for your suggestions! I'm still listening to the bands/albums/songs you have recommended to me. If you have anymore suggestions, keep them coming!"

"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","I made a thread about this a few days ago (idk if you replied to it or not) but since you seem to know a lot of deathcore, do you know any bands that use a ton of tremolo picking? stuff like ABRBs allegiance ... with blood comes cleansing... etc

"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Rings Of Saturns new album"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Acrania, Thy Art is murder, Whitechapel, Oceano, The acacia strain, Black tongue, Suicide silence, I declare war, infant annihilator, make them suffer, the last ten seconds of life, and hell followed with, rose funeral, or emmure.     

Those are what I would consider my staple bands probably. All different little niches of metal but a grander focus on what this subreddit tends to like and what is easy to get into.

You said you wanted some aspects of deathcore, most people will tell you chugging and breakdowns and they aren't wrong. It gets a lot of flak for being easy to play and people say it's easy but in reality creating anything as crushing as the band's I've listed above takes a ton of skill and the more you listen the better you appreciate how simple music can still break your bones"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","I remember the first time I listened through Wormwood by TAS I thought, ""pfft, lame"" and then I gave it another once through at a friend's behest, and *really listened* to the music itself, and despite that albums flaws, I can honestly say it's probably one of my favorites in the genre. How angry the vocalist sounds, and how sincerely he seems to hate everything, plus those riffs just gets me. 

That got a little out of hand and long winded, but my point is, I guess, I like your list, and recommend that album by them in particular. It seems like I have an easier time hearing the details(?) rather than just a bunch of dissonant noise and incomprehensible words, like so many deathcore bands are prone too. "
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Thanks for your detail, I'll check those bands out!"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","/u/keepitcutthroat will probably be more help than I, but as someone who likes similar stuff when it comes to Metalcore you could try Carnifex. Especially their second album, [The Diseased and the Poisoned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHTAj8wirsM). If you like that you could try their first album, and As Blood Runs Black's first album Allegiance. You might give Knights of the Abyss' second album [Shades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32JGiq-Rz6I) a try too. Of course Job for a Cowboy's ep [Doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jhi88tjS7A). 

If you just want to dive right into it you could try Thy Art is Muder's ep [Infinite Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxqzNbcj1d8)"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Thanks for the links! I'll check them out!"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","the red chord. Doom by Job For a Cowboy. The Cleansing by Suicide Silence. Lorna Shore. The Acacia Strain."
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Thanks for the suggestion!"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Definitely agree with the red chord. I have been obsessing over them lately. 

They are a good mix of deathcore and metalcore. Pretty techy shit too. "
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Technically they're mathcore, but they perfect for bridging the gap"

"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Which album would that be?"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","I don't think I've ever met another person who agrees with me, but in my opinion, Awaken the Dreamers is probably the closest to a perfect album I've ever heard. There's not a single part of any song on there I was would change. "
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","For me, the best album is the price of existence. Really brotal but really melodic too.
I love others albums too (btw, do not forget the first album ;))"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","That's the one I hear most commonly. The only one I can say anything really negative about is This is Where it Ends. That was a weak record. "
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","agree"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","[Whitechapel is a must](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9tj-xH1qU)"

"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Hence why I linked Possession "
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","People consider current Whitechapel not deathcore? 

And people are linking Chelsea grin as deathcore? Woah. "
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Because Chelsea grin is clearly deathcore? "
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Lol no they aren't. They are sell outs "
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Except they're deathcore"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Still makes them deathcore though right? "
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Apparently being deathcore has a political stigma that you must be underground to still be deathcore /s"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","I think you would like In Dying Arms"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","I'll take a look, thanks!"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Allegiance by As Blood Runs Black, that was the first deathcore album I ever listened to, still one of my favorites."
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Awesome! Thanks for the comment I'll be checking them out too!"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","I would definitely recommend The Acacia Strain, and of course Whitechapel (if you haven't heard them already ha). Phil Bozeman is easily one of the best in the genre. "
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","I wish he'd quit layering his vocals so heavily. I can barely understand about 1/3 of Our Endless War, and it's not like I'm new to the style"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","in dying arms 

they can mix the br00tal vocals with more melodic cleans to make it a bit different"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Thanks, I've seen a few posts about In Dying Arms, I'll be sure to check them out!"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","I like Carnifex's Die Without Hope a lot but I got into deathcore through Suicide Silence. I feel SS is a major gateway band for deathcore so they are safe to try out. You Only Live Once's lyrics are kinda eh but it is really catchy and that got me into deathcore. I like Chelsea Grin and Whitechapel as well."
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Thanks for the suggestions, I'll defiantly take a look!"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","I'm surprised that no one has mentioned carnifex their most recent album die without hope was amazing and is a must listen to"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Thanks, it'll be on my to-listen-to-list!"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Np! Its really cool cause they take a lot of influence from black metal so it has that feel plus the deathcore stuff"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Aenimus, Depths of Hatred, Rose Funeral, Within the Ruins, Lorelei, Aversion's Crown, Ovid's Withering, Slice the Cake, Veil of Maya, Humanity's Last Breath..... deathcore is alright. technical death metal is where its at"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Upvote for Slice the Cake. Fucking hell yeah bro. "
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","huge fan of them. they kill it"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","New Chelsea Grin is amazing as are Born of Osiris two most recent albums "
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Old Chelsea Grin*"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Idk i think theyre newest album is totally different from everything else theyve done and about a hundred times better. "
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Agreed"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","And I'll take a look *back* at them too! Thanks!"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","I'll be sure to listen to them, thanks for you suggestion!"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","If you're looking for something to ease you in, definitely go with [Betraying The Martyrs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ykuf11YkmHo). They have cleans, and mix a sort of post-hardcore/metalcore sound with some of the heavier aspects of deathcore. Born Of Osiris is probably another good one as they aren't particularly super heavy. From there maybe check out Thy Art Is Murder, Make Them Suffer, Aversions Crown (all aussies) and maybe Suicide Silence, Chelsea Grin, Carnifex or Whitechapel. These are some of the more popular deathcore bands and arent hard to get into"
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","Hard to say what's friendly to start with because we're all different! I can only provide one of my favorite bands, [Impending Doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPAA-OJdh3Y). Death will reign! Please let me know what you think."
"What should I start with if I want to listen to Deathcore?","You should start where a lot of people did with some of the older stuff. 

Job for a cowboy-Doom

Despised Icon-The ills of modern man or the healing process (or any of them, I love these guys) 

Whitechapel-somatic defilement or this is exile

As blood runs black-allegiance 

Suicide silence-the cleansing

Through the eyes of the dead-bloodlust or malice both are great 

And as always 

Infant annihilator is a must 

Then go from there it just keeps getting better,
