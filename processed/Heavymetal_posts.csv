"Can someone help me figure out a metal band from late 80s, possibly early 90s?  I have very little to go off of so this is a serious challenge","Okay, so I remember a long time ago listening to this metal band and I can only vaguely remember one song that started out slow with an almost pulsating, guitar riff that was about five notes long, with a brief pause in between (reminded me almost of a helicopter) and then after a few measures of that it broke into a really fast riff with the drums playing fast like 8th or 16ths on the snare I believe.. jeez this is ridiculously vague. The lead singer's voice, though, was the unique thing I remember.. it sounded almost like he was yelling underwater. This is probably a lost cause as this is all I can remember but I thought someone might have an idea. I think I'd recognize the band name if I saw it.  I think this was from the late 80s early 90s, for what it's worth.  Thanks!"
"Can someone help me figure out a metal band from late 80s, possibly early 90s?  I have very little to go off of so this is a serious challenge","The 'yelling underwater' part makes me think of The Jesus Lizard. Hardly a metal band, though. "

Most early 80s thrash and teutonic metal had heavy reverb on the vocals. Everything from Metallica to Sodom to Kreator. 
From your description, though, it sounds like you're talking about [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GASMNuD3yk&amp;feature=channel) by Morbid Angel. "

"Looking for some advice....","I like older metal like Iron Maiden and I've been trying to find some more bands to listen to. After some attempts I came across Skeletonwitch. LOVE the music HATE the vocals. Does anyone have any advice to other bands to look into? "
"Looking for some advice....","This is abandoned, try http://www.reddit.com/r/metal"
"Looking for some advice....","Check out Manowar, Megadeth, AC DC, Dio, Motorhead etc. They are all bands coming from the same era and roots."
"Looking for some advice....","&gt;Manowar, Megadeth, Dio (including heaven and hell, which was dio + black sabbath, as well as rainbow, elf, and his solo stuff), Motorhead

these. 

also, if you're looking for another band with polarizing vocals, try 3 inches of blood. you'll either love them or hate them. 

if you like maiden dig deeper into the power metal genre, manowar is a good start. 

my suggestion HIBRIA http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdfFqiRonO8

also try iced earth, here's them covering iron maiden's ""hallowed be thy name"" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PVbzO0X6dU

and some originals

Am I allowed to be a metal fan if there isn't much metal I hate?  There's lots that's just meh, I don't really hate that much. I've found most metal fans are pretty polarized about the metal they listen to though."
"Greetings - Welcome to the Heavy Metal Sub-reddit. Post your favorite metal or hardcore groups","Why does everybody hate Dimmu so much?  Is it because they've had some commercial success?"
"Greetings - Welcome to the Heavy Metal Sub-reddit. Post your favorite metal or hardcore groups","A lot of it has to do with sounding like ass.  I wasn't aware of their commercial success when I first heard them but still could not stand them.  And, I like some crappy black metal."

"Greetings - Welcome to the Heavy Metal Sub-reddit. Post your favorite metal or hardcore groups","Bad Brains is metal(punk)? You hate meshuggah(awesome)? Seems you left out some of the good nu-metal (Chimaira comes to mind). If you can hate on progressive cock rock like dream theater, why not Rush? I do like your respect to older bands like Morbid Angel, having said that where's suicidal tendencies or coc? Eh, Guess the list is subjective, but a pretty good list nonetheless. Who doesnt love deicide and slayer? Who doesnt hate Savatage?"

"How do we all feel about the new Trivium album","I know I might be late to the party but seriously, I actually enjoy the album, definitely no Shogun or Ascendancy. What do you think the redeeming tracks were? I feel Dusk Dismantled, Watch The World Burn, Caustic Are The Ties That Bind, and Of All These Yesterdays were actually fairly good tracks. Black was pretty cool, but the solo really let me down, considering that Corey Beaulieu is one of my major influences, that solo was definitely not his best. I enjoyed A Grey So Dark from the extended edition (learned to play it) but it is just more of a radio song."
"How do we all feel about the new Trivium album","Excellent best album i've heard in a very long time. They really did focus on the music on this album instead of showing off."
"How do we all feel about the new Trivium album","Definitely the best metal album I've heard this year, I still need to hear the new Mastodon album though. I personally felt none of the songs got super bland at any point, but I feel that you can't listen to 'In Waves' the song without 'Capsizing The Sea'"

"How do we all feel about the new Trivium album","Trivium's new album is ok, but it doesn't compare to their shredding of the others.
