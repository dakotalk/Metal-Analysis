"Thief caught trying to sell Beneath Oblivion's stolen gear - Local 12 WKRC-TV Cincinnati","Who do we have to thank for this? Jeff Fucking Morgan from Rwake.

"From Romantic to Doom - the journey of a piece of piano music from 1892 to a doom metal version in 2006.","I'm a big fan of lots of different types of music, including classical. One of my favourite pieces is Sergei Rachmaninov's ""[Prelude in C# minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXQCPAR0EHo)"". Around the time I heard this, I was getting into Sabbath, Electric Wizard et. al. and the dark chords in this piece really spoke to me. I was also getting into prog rock, especially Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, who ""heavied"" up classical pieces, such as Bartok's ""The Barbarian"", Prokofiev's ""Dance of the Knights"" and Mussorgsky's ""Pictures at an Exhibition"". I thought it would be really cool if a metal band would cover the Prelude in C# minor!


Jump forward a few years and there I am, getting into Dutch progressive rock, and I stumble upon an LP by Ekseption. I recognised one track straight away - it was [their take on the Prelude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaQ1_DWrFkg)! My main problem with their rendition, and indeed with most of their material, is the extensive use of horns. But it was heading towards what I had envisaged from years before.



Not long afterwards, I found out a bit more about doom metal, and I also discovered a doom metal band covered the Ekseption song. From their 2006 album, The Burning Halo, Draconian offered up what [I had been looking for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y06P8KpzsVA). Personally I wish it didn't have the harsh vocals, but that's just my preference. It's still a great rendition.

"why I love Ufomammut","there's a moment in most Ufomammut songs when it really just kicks in. most of you probably know what I mean: the song builds and builds, and there's a moment when the effects and distortion all come together. you headbang a little harder at this part, and it continues for a few bars. 

then it REALLY happens. the song straight up goes nuclear, almost catching you off guard. the bass increases, and the mixing almost seems to shift into the back of your head. this part is what truly makes the buildup all worth it.

EDIT: example - at about 2:40 of ""Oroborus""

"why I love Ufomammut","&gt;~~a moment in most Ufomammut songs~~

on most Ufomammut albums*

Call me old fashioned, but bands like Ufomammut should really be listened to as it was intended, in my opinion: From first to last track on the album. Nothing is left to coincidence on their releases. Artwork, lyrics, music, order of songs is all carefully put together to provide a full experience. Picking the songs out of order (or in this case, linking to somewhere in the middle of a song) borders blasphemy in my book. 

But that's just me. They are one of my absolute favourite bands as well. "
"why I love Ufomammut","I feel the same way, actually. I am 100% an ""entire album"" person. I just noticed this phenomenon happening in multiple songs within an album."

I wear glasses and often use the arms for just this purpose so I tapped him on the shoulder, handed him my glasses and mimed that he should use them his face lit up in a huge smile, he gratefully accepted, sparked up the blunt, had 3 tokes and passed it to me and utterly refused to take it back.

"[meta] What advice would you give to an aspiring doom band?","I just started one and we've been dicking around with ideas and we need some pointers to help us develop our sound/band in general."
"[meta] What advice would you give to an aspiring doom band?","As someone who picked up a guitar specifically to join a buddy's stoner/doom band two and half months ago, take everything I say with a massive grain of salt.

I think the most important lesson we've learned so far is that a lot of times keeping things as simple as possible is better. Don't get too crazy with your songwriting; this seems like something that's a lot harder for people who are longtime and highly skilled musicians. They feel like they have to put so much into every riff when a lot of the ""heavy"" comes from letting the riff come out naturally. Don't get me wrong, get good at your instruments, but remember you're playing doom and not some technical shit.

Secondly, while equipment isn't going to make the band alone, it sure as fuck makes a difference. I just picked up a Boss FZ-2 Hyperfuzz pedal and holy fuck did it make a difference. You don't always need the biggest most expensive shit but sometimes it makes sense when you see all the greats using similar equipment, you know?

Third, JAM. Jam, jam, jam. Come up with a cool riff or whatever, then play it with your band but keep fucking around with it.

Lastly, originality, while nice, isn't always the main goal. Play what you want to hear, experiment with different sounds from different inspirations. Don't be a pure cover band but don't be afraid to be comparable. As time goes on your personal sound will develop but take lessons from the masters rather than diving head first.

Again, don't take this too seriously. I probably don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I don't really know stylistically what you're trying to play and a lot of it depends on that. I also don't know your musical experience so I'm formulating my response off of my own (lack of) experience."
"[meta] What advice would you give to an aspiring doom band?","Disclaimer: I am not in a metal band. 

I have been playing a lot of other music over the years. I would recommend you find bands that you really enjoy. Play their songs. Try to copy their sound. Figure what it is that they do that you like. This may lead to a pedal set up you haven't thought of, or techniques you haven tried yet. Then branch out onto your own sound. 

I'm not saying you should just be Sleep or Windhand (sub in your favorite band) copy cat. But you will probably learn a lot by trying to play their songs. "
"[meta] What advice would you give to an aspiring doom band?","This is a double edged sword. This is a good place to start and acquire your desired sound/direction..but after that, learn some other things from different bands or even other genres of music that you can take back and incorporate into your sound...it will help with originality and not becoming a cover/tribute band"
"[meta] What advice would you give to an aspiring doom band?","Yeah definitely. "

"Time To Die... The verdict?","I have read a lot of great reviews of the new Electric Wizard album, and also read hundreds of shitty comments.
Who has bought it/streamed it/stole it and listened to it and what do you think? 

I will start us of by saying that I think its fucking great and I'm gonna have it on rotation for a long while to come."
"Time To Die... The verdict?","Way better than black mass. Others don't exactly wow me, but after black mass, I'll take what I can get. 

I am Nothing and We Love the Dead are both awesome, classic-sounding Wizard songs. It's worth it just for those two. "
"Time To Die... The verdict?","Definitely better than Black Mass although there's good stuff on that album too. 
Others don't wow you, what do you mean?
There hasn't been an Electric Wizard album made yet that isn't worth a listen. Some are more durable than others. 
I Am Nothing is definitely the standout track for me so far. 
I get a bit tired of this 'Old Wizard' thing though. Everyone seems to want them to sound exactly as they did circa Dopethrone/Come My Fanatics, but they simultaneously want something new, and then moan when they get it. 
I think this album proves they are fighting fit and still have a lot to offer. "
"Time To Die... The verdict?","I deleted a part of my comment so I guess what I said makes less sense, sorry... I'm drunk.

I meant that some songs don't wow me, but it's a much better overall album than black mass. I'm never expected another CMF/Dopethrone, but I really, really didn't like Black Mass. So this was a welcome change.

They're still fighting fit for sure, but ever since the guys that started Ramesses left they became a bit more...one dimensional. And considering what Ramesses put out on their own, you gotta admit that they lost some of their talent. Jus Osborn may be the bandleader, but he wasn't all of Electric Wizard. That all said, this album made me happy. I wasn't expecting dopethrone, I was just hoping it wouldn't suck. And it didn't. So I'm pretty happy."
"Time To Die... The verdict?","I like it. It's heavy and repetitive. 

For some context my favorite record by the Wiz is ""Let Us Prey""."
"Time To Die... The verdict?","It has dark satanical atmospheres and some groovy riffs. That's it is NOT a guitar centric album. Most of the songs are relient on the atmosphere and not the strength of the guitar parts. I am Nothing is perhaps the most memorable guitar riff. "
"Time To Die... The verdict?","I was impressed by it.  It's not in the same league as their pre Black Masses stuff, but I only streamed it a couple of times (haven't bought it yet).  I'm definitely enjoying it though.  Sadiowitch was a bit of a Black masses rehash but it's still good and there are some real gems on it.  Not sure if I dig it as much as the Legalize Drugs EP yet but like I say I haven't listened to it too much.  So far I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10."
"Time To Die... The verdict?","I'd definitely give it some more of you time... I've listened a fair bit since the release and its been a total pleasure... I'm so stoked Clayton Burgess has joined the band on bass... Satan's Satyrs are my favourite new band by far... I don't think he recored on the new record (I think Juss did the bass parts) but I'm sure he was influenced by Burgess' playing.

I kind of regretted this post because I'm bored of people moaning about the album, and obviously this just invited people to do that some more... Electric Wizard are the rarest of things... they have created a rich and unique world of sounds and stuck to it for 20 years plus... It bums me out when all people can do is complain that they a re-using a couple of riffs... It just feels people don't take the time to really listen and pay respect...

Whatever, i'm just unburdening myself to you... not sure why... 
Glad you like it "
"Time To Die... The verdict?","Over-teased by Osborn (Dopethrone-like, hateful stuff), and I was a bit dissapointed in the end (SadioWitch, their most awful song). I kinda like this album, but it will not be on my AOTY list. 

Even thought I really dig the first track, I can't help but hear a Dopethrone riff. When I gave another ear to Black Masses, I really liked that playthrogh, because of the atmospheres, similar to Witchcult Today. 

For a Electric Wizard maniac, it's a disappointment. Osborn gave us the ""Back to the roots"" speech and promises. So I except a lot from that album (maybe too much). But on the other hand, it's an honest enjoyable album, really heavy (the bass sound, raaaaa), with good moments. I love ""I Am Nothing"" and ""Funeral Of Your Mind""

Oh, there's only ONE thing that pissed me off : THE ENDING. ""Oh look it's the same sample at the beggining of Dopethrone, derp."" I couldn't help but think about Osborn teasing everybody telling how much this album sounds like Dopethrone. It spoils everything !"

"Question: What type of imagery does listening to some of your favorite Doom bring to mind?","For example, sometimes when I am really high and following the smoke to the riff filled lands I picture a man (much stronger and badass looking than I) standing on a beach just smashing coconuts with a baseball bat hundreds of yards out into the ocean. Through storms and fair weather day and night just sending coconuts flying. People ask him what he is doing and all he ever says is ""waiting."" 


One day (usually when the guitars cut out and it's just a funk bass riff caring my mind to the deepest darkest emptiest places of outerspace) a huge storm comes in and shit starts looking really gnarly, but this dude is just standing there with his baseball bat just mean mugging the shit out of the ocean. Well as the bass starts playing a little heavier and some guitar feedback comes screeching through a god damn comet hits the ocean and creates a fucking massive tidal wave. As the guitar starts playing the same riff as the bass and the drummer starts whaling on the cymbals, a smile creeps across this guys face and he gets his baseball bat into position. 


Waves start beating down on this guy and he is just waiting for the big wave to come in. And as this like 100ft wave approaches he exhales and goes to swing. And the point is not about if he can or can not repel a wave, the point is he is heavy enough to fucking try.

"Question: What type of imagery does listening to some of your favorite Doom bring to mind?","Dopesmoker was a fun experience when I was really high, I remember the guitar feeling like some kind of calm tide next to an island, but it felt like the water was a digital render, like it was made out of polygons and all blocky. When the drums and bass came in, it felt slowly like I was being taken off the floor and then when the bass does the big slide in and starts playing the riff I was swept up off the chair I was on, and I was suddenly backflipping through this giant ocean, it had gone from a really pale cyan colour to a deep, deep blue by this point.

I'm not too sure what happened for the next 10 minutes really, I was just spinning around seeing all the currents of water.

Not on a par with your story OP, but I figured I'd share something. it's interesting we both think of giant oceans when the bass comes in though, I wonder if it happens to anyone else?"
"Question: What type of imagery does listening to some of your favorite Doom bring to mind?","I have a ""doom land"" in my head. Which I later learned was just the world from ""Dune"", but with more hooded cultists and such.

"searching for doom metal musicians","well im looking for advice, im trying to compose doom/deathy metal but im just stuck, and wanna know what scales or tunings i should be using.
for the record i use http://www.espguitars.com/products/8526-stef-b-7?category_id=1963406-stephen-carpenter and idk what scale im using, just pure feels. any advice will do :D"
"searching for doom metal musicians","I don't know if this will make sense, but the guitar you play is irrelevant. You just need to get the instrument to play low notes without buzzing on any frets. So if you're detuned a half or full step below normal E tuning then it should ring clear. 

The best musicians are telling a story, in this case their guitars might evoke the slow crawl of rust across a desolate urban landscape void of humans, or crops failing mysteriously of blight, or villages succumbing to a plague one by one, or horrors of the last moments on earth as ICBMs are launched for delivery to your practice space.  Just get the right dark mood, which might need larger speakers and amps that are stronger on the low end. "
"searching for doom metal musicians","It's not exactly *irrelevant* what guitar you use, I mean you wouldn't use a Fender Strat to play death metal, for example.  I mean, it's physically possible, but you certainly wouldn't chose to. "
"searching for doom metal musicians","Single coils can work fine. The amp settings and such make more of a diffrence."
"searching for doom metal musicians","I can't condone drug use but I do recommend you try to take the time to learn as much about music theory as possible. Music is a language, and you need to learn the elements of it before you can start to write poetry. Once you have the basic elements in place, you can start to make it a regular part of your life. 

For example, some elements of heavy metal / doom metal music that I like are the slow, empty fifth chord riffs with a groovy beat. In fact, in a short answer to your main question, fifths are really the key to metal. If you play on that interval (say A to E flat) with the right distortion and with a cool rhythm, you're already on your way to writing heavy riffs. 

Just take it slow, remember that music is a science as well as a language and above all, it's absolutely imperative that you ***Listen to Vol. 4***"
"searching for doom metal musicians","The easy answer is - smoke weed. But seriously, I play bass so composing from a bassist's POV is something entirely different than guitar. But when composing, First, I choose a slower tempo (depends on the mood I want to set), compose very easy straight drums (kick/hihat snare/hihate kick/hihat snare/hihat 4/4 pattern) and just jam to them. Messing with different chord patterns and  sounds is a must. I'm trying to create/find very interesting riff progression. When I have some basic structure coming out, I try to expand on that. mostly using minor, harmonic and melodic scales. Then, I rework the drums so the bass and drums are locked in together (this is the hardest part, creating good drumline locked in with the bassline). Then I just add some melodies and it's near finished. Then I play and toy with the song to see if it can be improved. Sometimes, I do smoke weed during some or whole part of the ordeal. But if you decide to smoke, compose both stoned and sober. Sometimes when you're stoned (or on drugs generally), you think you can compose a maestro piece but then you sober up and discover that it's utter shit.

Protip: you might or might not downtune your guitar. That depends solely on you and the sound you want to achieve. You can play some heavy funeral shit even on a guitar E A D G C e, if you're creative. But if you like to downtune then go ahead and compose!"

The townspeople bottle and sell his blood, just really kick him when he's down, so the album is about the devil's revenge on the town.

Into the ground, this martian temple
You’ve invoked the curse of evil templars

Raise your fists now you exist
The bell of doom strikes 13th hour

All the chosen time to put down your bongs
Take up a knife end all life
Legalise drugs and murder
Satanas luciferus we pledge these souls to you
Now satans slaves, your lives weren't saved
Die now in the shadow of the pentagram

right???


(maybe he'll need some easy money and do an Obsessed tour. that'd make me so happy)"
"Saint Vitus to tour Europe with original singer Scott Reagers","It might be because he was banned from Europe because of his drug bust."
"Saint Vitus to tour Europe with original singer Scott Reagers","He can't be banned from Europe (a continent), maybe Norway (where he was busted)."
"Saint Vitus to tour Europe with original singer Scott Reagers","Maybe the European Union? That's why he was deported from the continent and not just the country. All speculative of course."
"Saint Vitus to tour Europe with original singer Scott Reagers","As an ""European"" I can say that you can't be kicked out of the ""European Union"" since this ""union"" is just economic (and financial in some countries that use the euro). Norway isn't even a member of the EU. Maybe there's a lot more behind this sad story."

"Check out our new songs! High on fire/Red fang sound",""
"Check out our new songs! High on fire/Red fang sound","Haha wow the vocalist sounds eerily similar to Matt."
"Check out our new songs! High on fire/Red fang sound","I feel like the vocals still sound really forced, just to get that kind of tone.  And the layered vocals in the first track were really sloppy, pulled me right out of the song.  Highlander has MUCH better vocals, they sound really natural.  Vocals should always sound really natural.

Obviously if you (or the singer) want to keep working with those kinds of guttural vocals you'll need to destroy your throat.  Tom Waits has suggested that he yelled/screamed into a pillow for about an hour a day.  That kind of yelling needs to be combined with a throat that actually rattles, then the right sound will come out and it'll take far less effort.  Singing like Matt Pike or Tom Waits means doing things wrong, it will involve ruining your singing voice and causing pain.  It will hurt.  Commit to it and you'll have badass vocals, otherwise you'll always sound like you're doing a character voice.

Until maybe years of doing it catches up and then you finally earn that gravel. 


I dig your style though, that thick and chunky sound."
"Check out our new songs! High on fire/Red fang sound","Thank you for your awesome feedback I really appreciate it. I must admit March and Die is the first time our bass player Duncan sang, Highlander is by our guitar player who has done a lot more songs. I fully agree with you about the vocal damage and training needed to keep up with this. 

Again, thx for you advise!"
"Check out our new songs! High on fire/Red fang sound","Thanks to you too. 

For what it's worth, he seems to have a good sound developing.  His voice is steady and he seems to have enough air for it.  So if nothing else I'd say it's nearly there, but that extra commitment to throat destruction and I'm sure there's some solid noteworthy vocals in there.  "

If someone asked you what your favorite metal song was what would you say? If someone asked me I'd probably not have an answer and just say something along the same lines. Am i really gonna sit there and explain to them why Xasthur's Prison of Mirrors is my favorite song while they stare at me blankly not knowing what the fuck I'm talking about? or am i gonna say The Trooper by Iron Maiden fuck yeah!!! She's not a metal head and (I'm assuming) an interviewer asked her. It's not like Miley Cyrus saying she never listened to a jay-z song after she used a line about it in a song."

"what genre is my band?","I'm starting a band called Ad Astra (not trying to pimp us out) but I'm not really sure what our genre is, I like to call us Doom metal we draw a lot from sabbath and have growling vocals (imagine ahab/YOB) except were not that slow like most doom bands, but were also not fast, we kinda hav a slow-medium tempo.... so are we sludge or what?"
"what genre is my band?","Doom isn't always slow. Stuff like ahab and sunn 0))) are extremely slow. Candlemass has some mid tempo songs, then there's always sludge like mastodon's first album and stuff like high on fire. It would help if you posted some of your music, but making music isn't really about fitting into a genre, it's more about exploring and expanding it, make your own style"

This got quoted a lot by us as a hype thang- and within a short while things got outta hand, Sleep began to entertain managers/lawyers/ etc to extricate themselves from our record deal.Bands quitting an indie that discoverd and/or supported them to go join with major label is quite commonplace it seems.'

Kadavar,

"Looking for new Bands (what I like in text), what are yall's favorites?","Thanks. This is the kind of post I'm looking for if someone asks for new bands. New names to me + links to the music."
"Looking for new Bands (what I like in text), what are yall's favorites?","Awesome list, also thanks for taking the time to link them all. "
"Looking for new Bands (what I like in text), what are yall's favorites?","You're welcome! I think I had more fun making it than most people do listening to it; I enjoy posts like these because they make me go back though my music collection and dig out old favorites I may not have listened to in a while. Honestly, I left a lot of other stuff out, just because it didn't fit anywhere between Electric Wizard and Candlemass."
"Looking for new Bands (what I like in text), what are yall's favorites?","Awesome list...I have to rebuild my digital collection, so if you feel like making more lists, send 'em my way!"
"Looking for new Bands (what I like in text), what are yall's favorites?","Hmm, if you're really that convicted about it, I could put everything with a 'doom' or 'Stoner' tag on it into a Bitsync folder and send you the sync key.... "

"Looking for new Bands (what I like in text), what are yall's favorites?","If you like Blood Ceremony, check out other female-fronted occult rock bands like Jex Thoth, Mount Salem, and Electric Citizen. Avatarium is another female-fronted doom band with Leif Edling of Candlemass. Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats are a great Sabbathy doom band that even opened for Sabbath last year. Since you like Candlemass, also check out Solitude Aeturnus, they're like the American C-mass. Ghost isn't everyone's cup of tea but check out their first album. Check out Subrosa, its like Electric Wizard and Sleep, but with a female singer and violins. Witchfinder General is a good old school traditional doom band as well.

P.S. A lot of the bands you listed are my favorites."

"Sunn o))) - Why Dost Thou Hide Thyself in Clouds",""
"Sunn o))) - Why Dost Thou Hide Thyself in Clouds","I think this is Csihar's best vocal performance. The organ is at the other end of the church from the sanctuary (where I assume the amps were set up), so it probably created an antiphonal effect in live performance that isn't captured here, where you have Csihar's voice coming from the front and the organ coming from the back.

edit: if you like the use of the organ in this, give Messiaen's [Apparition of the Eternal Church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUgm1Pp_l9Y) a listen. It's more or less proto-drone, at least in my opinion."
"Sunn o))) - Why Dost Thou Hide Thyself in Clouds","Such a cool live recording in the Bergen Cathedral in Norway"
"Sunn o))) - Why Dost Thou Hide Thyself in Clouds","The following track, Canon, is my favourite from this album."

"My Dying Bride - Base Level Erotica [post/doom, UK, 1998]","I will always upvote MDB"
"My Dying Bride - Base Level Erotica [post/doom, UK, 1998]","Same. Der überlebende is probably my personal fav from that album. One of the few bands out there that haven't done a bad album... In my opinion."
"My Dying Bride - Base Level Erotica [post/doom, UK, 1998]","Can't wait for the new album. Shame it probably won't be out this winter."
"My Dying Bride - Base Level Erotica [post/doom, UK, 1998]","It's always nice to find people who actually like *34.788%...Complete*. I'd definitely say it was a misstep/failure, and of course it marks the departure of Martin Powell (and thus the end of the 'classic' MDB era), but it's a very interesting sort of failure.

Gods I wish they'd find themselves a good violinist again though; I'm just not convinced by the use of it on the latest albums, though that could just be the way it all meshes with the rest of the music."
"My Dying Bride - Base Level Erotica [post/doom, UK, 1998]","It's definitely in my top 3 favorites from MDB. The other two are Songs Of Darkness, Words Of Light, and The Dreadful Hours. Their newer albums have some great tracks, but they're not albums I could stand the whole way through."
"My Dying Bride - Base Level Erotica [post/doom, UK, 1998]","I think you can split My Dying Bride in to a number of distinct eras, each with their own particular fans; the albums people like most tend to be fairly sequential. For me, it's the three album run from *Turn Loose the Swans* to *Like Gods of the Sun*, with *Turn Loose...* perhaps being the best. I think it just hangs together as a total listening experience in a way none of their other albums quite manage; the slow build-up of intensity from Sear Me MCMXCIII through the next two tracks up until the doomdeath moments in The Snow in My Hand...so good."
"My Dying Bride - Base Level Erotica [post/doom, UK, 1998]","Misstep maybe, but failure seems a little harsh. I prefer to call it an experiment."
"My Dying Bride - Base Level Erotica [post/doom, UK, 1998]","I hated it when it first came out.  After the first listen, I tossed it aside and ignored it for a few months.  Eventually, I went back to it, and it became one of my favourites."

"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","I always find it pretty cool meeting someone who doesn't smoke weed but still appreciates the riffs and simplicity and stoner doom as a whole."
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Been a long time since I used anything. Life make more sense and I'm less of a dick for it. Stoner rock is just downright fucking cool music. I'll enjoy Roadsaw with a straight mind any time thanks. For me it became a case of rock out and take control of your shit because that actually rocks, rather than medicate your pathetic snivelling hiney in a semi-psycotic dependant state of confusion. Times change. Everyone is different. Lots of my friends are into all sorts of things and I don't care, they're cool about shit."
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","used to use all kinds of stuff years ago. Havent now in awhile. I do still drink pretty often, but im never listening to doom while i'm drunk. It's generally kick ass background music to when I am working or browsing reddit."
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Same here: the regularity of the heavy riffs helps me focus when I'm working."
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Listen to AND play in a stoner doom band. No drinking, getting high, or smoking cigarettes. "

"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Why would I smoke weed or do drugs while listening to doom?

I like mellow sounds, I'm a mellow dude, and a bit on the depressive side. I enjoy music that reflects my mental state."
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","I am also a mellow depressive dude and think my love of doom springs from that.

Drinking totally enhances the experience for me. I expect drugs would also do that but I don't have any."

"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Welcome. I'm not even sure I'm depressed, I just like to listen to doom and pretend that I am. Depressive things resonate with me."
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Be glad you're not haha, it's a dark road that looks inviting. I know what you mean though, depressing things hit the hardest emotionally compared to everything else with me
"
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Can relate to that. My depression may be the cause of me listening to doom metal, but there is just no other music that feels this real to me. ""Happy"" music just feels like a delusion."
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Big fan of stoner but I don't do weed (or cigs/alcohol). Just enjoying the heavy rifs!"
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Right here. Stoner doom is just good stuff. However, a lot of my time spent listening to it (especially full and even consecutive Dopesmoker listening) has been when I'm loopily tired."
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Wait... is that like a prerequisite? Have been into doom for years and never in that ttme had I taken any drug, apart from alcohol. "
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Stoner Doom is my favorite genre. Only tried weed once and it wasn't related to the music. I don't care about the relation of weed to the genre, but it kinda gets annoying that other people think you're a stoner just for listening to the genre. Some are even offended if you're not a stoner. Overall I think stoner doom concerts are the most chill, might be because of weed but also overall attitude of people."
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","I can't speak for myself, I write my best riffs stoned. However I do have friends that are straight edge and way into stoner metal. While the music lends itself to stoners, indulging is not a requirement. "
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Zero drugs or alcohol or anything. I actually try to avoid people that openly express their love for beer or weed. People don't don't expect that kind of behavior from me because some of my favorite bands are sabbath, fu Manchu, and municipal waste, a ton of heavily drug and alcohol influenced bands. I also really enjoy a lot of punk, straight edge included, and I get a lot of funny looks when I jump from electric wizard to minor threat. I feel like the music you enjoy shouldn't dictate your lifestyle. 

I don't drink or smoke because of events caused by other people that put me in some really bad places in life. I decided a couple years ago that I wasn't going to become the person I hated most.   "

I just love me some heavy riffs.  I honestly don't see how this would be strange to enjoy without an altered state of mind.  I even love the droney stuff.  I love the subtle complexity of the heaviest, lowest sounds.  "

"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","I don't smoke weed, but I use other drugs. Aside from alcohol I'm typically not listening to metal when I'm fucked up though."

If you have to do drugs to listen to a music, then its not very good music.  I HATE that its called stoner rock.  Its just hard rock with tinges of other stuff thrown in.  Now certain kinds of EDM, I definitely cant imagine listening to those sober."

"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Stoner is my favorite kind of metal by far. I never smoked anything and I never will. Just enjoying some pretty fucking badass riffs and heavy songs. Like one said before, the slow tempo and repetitive riffs help me to focus when I try to work. Weird but it works for me. When I listen to stoner in public places, life seems to go at 10x speed and I almost feel like I'm somewhere else out of this world. Drugs don't help, the music is the only drug."

tl:dr doom metal is the gateway drug."
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","I was going to ask this myself.  I don't do any drugs and never have.  Just 2 or 3 beers or a mixed drink once in a while on a weekend.  

I often listen to stoner/doom while I'm relaxing at my computer playing games, especially driving or FPS games.  I think I get into a nice natural high state, no drugs required.

"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","One of my favorite bands is Eyehategod, but I don't do heroin (anymore).  I also had stopped smoking by the time I was at the apex of my Sleep worship."
"Just out of curiosity, how many of you listen to doom metal (more specifically, stoner doom) but don't smoke weed or do any drugs?","Yup, me. I've been listening to the music since before any of my peers were experimenting with drugs. Master of Reality was my gateway drug. I've smoked pot a couple times, but it's not really for me. I'm not even a heavy drinker. "

I really enjoy the riffs and the distortions that stoner doom offers.

"Randy Holden - Fruit And Icebergs - Population II - 1969","I love this track, and the album is really heavy... total facemelter... and no bass, which is just crazy... Randy Holden was the guitarist in Blue Cheer for the 1969 album New! Improved!.. which is worth checking out if you don't know it... Blue Cheer are, in general, definitely worth you time...
I wouldn't quite put Holden up there with Tony Iommi, just by dint of the sheer length and breadth of Iommi's career of riffs... He stands alone...     
Having said that I really recommend Pop II to anyone who likes to dive into metal's heavy history..."

"Bass VI in doom?","can any of you give me examples or personal stories of using a bass VI or similar (I'm actually looking at the Ibanez crossover 6) for Doom?  I'm fronting a two piece doom band and I worry a bass by itself will sound empty, so I thought about running this through my bi-amped rig, with fuzz on the high end cab, to get a guitar and bass sound."
"Bass VI in doom?","I have actually thought about this quite often. I think it would sound really interesting, considering that a bass VI is pretty much a reallllly low guitar"
"Bass VI in doom?","Gentry Densley from Eagle Twin does something similar ... I don't think his guitar is as low-tuned as a Bass VI, but the bi-amped rig with gain pedals into the guitar amp definitely will work. They have an enormous live sound for a two-piece. "
"Bass VI in doom?","Pretty sure the girl from Mares of Thrace uses a baritone guitar stereo'd into a bass amp and an Orange guitar amp. Sounds pretty big. It's something I've thought about playing with myself. "
"Bass VI in doom?","Wow, they are really good, never heard them before.  I'm already doing a rig like that, with the low clean(er) sound going into a 2x15 and the higher sound going into a 4x10 with fuzz.  I just wondered how one of these would sound with it.  I think I'm definitely going to get one now.  I'll post a clip of my band with it when I get it."
"Bass VI in doom?","I've got an EBMM Bass VI and it actually sounds bitching through my Hovercraft Falcon/Emperor 2x12. I'd love to grab a bass head myself and see how it goes. "
"Bass VI in doom?","Lately I’ve been contemplating playing bass melodies over drones by using an EXH Freeze pedal in the effects loop of a Deluxe Memory Boy (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjFth1mg5Rc). It would probably work really well with this setup because you could freeze the drone into the bass amp and then switch to the guitar amp for melody."

"Hey guys, releasing the first song off my new stoner/doom album, would love some feedback on it! [crosspost from /r/stonerrock]","Feedback: The vocals are your most interesting part of the mix by FAR but are too quiet. The drumming is a big turnoff to me, way to much kick drumming and one-offs. Maybe you could try a looser more 'heavy' pace. I think it could synergize really well with the vocals instead of how the drum track is just doing its own thing.

I felt like you paid some homage to the pioneers of the genre very well. Feedback? If I had to pick one thing it would be the mix of the song, it felt a little flat to me. I can offer no solution to my feedback but there ya have it :)

Okay, two things: the voice intro really struck me as having been played out over the years.

Other than that keep it up! I didn't click through to the social media so maybe the answer to this question is there, but who's in the band?"
"Hey guys, releasing the first song off my new stoner/doom album, would love some feedback on it! [crosspost from /r/stonerrock]","its just me man, haha.. bedroom musician! Thanks for the feedback and listening..

I would agree with the mixing i guess, seeing how i don't really know what i'm doing and just doing it by ear. But am learning more stuff as i go so the tracks should start sounding better hopefully! 

And the voice intro bit was something that inspired the song so stuck it on there just as an homage! 

Anyways thanks again, i will be releasing more tracks soon, you can like the facebook page if you want, will probably update it there and will  be posting it on reddit too so no worries!"
"Hey guys, releasing the first song off my new stoner/doom album, would love some feedback on it! [crosspost from /r/stonerrock]","Here's my 2 cents: Drums sound too thin, especially bass drum needs more beef, low end. Guitar tone isn't really good either in my opinion, and bass lacks low end and general heaviness really badly. The strongest element is vocals in my opinion, sound quite original.

All in all it ain't bad, I liked it overall, just needs polishing. Don't want my input looking like bashing or anything, I listened twice and upvoted. Just trying to give some constructive criticism.

Edit: Also, if you're interested I can try recording heavier bass track next week."
"Hey guys, releasing the first song off my new stoner/doom album, would love some feedback on it! [crosspost from /r/stonerrock]","Hey man thanks for the feedback! I actually passed just the guitar track to another redditor who was kind enough to offer rerecording the drums, if you want i can pass you his track when he is done if you are keen.. PM me for sure with your preference!

"
"Hey guys, releasing the first song off my new stoner/doom album, would love some feedback on it! [crosspost from /r/stonerrock]","Nice! I'd prefer it with drums done, as bass should pretty much follow drumming. I'm waiting for an effect to be delivered anyway. Just don't forget about me when it's done!"

John Dyer Baizley (Baroness) works in a very similar way.

In addition to vibrant, organic coloring, the watercolors add texture from the paper, making the finished piece more unique.

"Church of Misery parts ways with 3 members.","From a moment ago:

&gt; Hi! Thanks for your kind words. Don't worry guys, Church of Misery NEVER gonna stop. I NEVER give up this band. As you know well, I wrote all songs &amp; lyrics of Church of Misery. I already have new many materials for next album. Hopefully, we will enter the studio when we got new guys. Next year, you can hear our new album and play in your country ( Europe, America etc ) again! I swear!

&gt; TATSU MIKAMI

Great to see that."
"Church of Misery parts ways with 3 members.","Fuck, that's really bad news! Tatsu changed guitarists often, but now the whole band basically broke up.

JJ was a pillar along with Tatsu, I love his style and groove (told him he's my favourite drummer just 3 months ago at a gig in Poland). 

Hideki is an awesome and original vocalist, also added a lot to the band's sound, he sang on the last 3 studio albums, he's also a great showman. 

Ikuma Kawabe arguably contributed the least to the sound of the band, but is a good guitarist that fitted the band just fine.

I'm glad I got to see them with JJ and Hideki. [Here's a pic of us with Mika Komine](http://i.imgur.com/k7Rqq3e.jpg), Tatsu's gf and their merch person."
"Church of Misery parts ways with 3 members.","I saw this on FB.  I'll admit I'm not ultra familiar with the band's output but I've really enjoyed what I heard.  I mean, with only one member left the band have essentially broken up.  That's a real shame, what a great band.  Even if they continue to record under the Church name, a new vocalist, guitarist AND drummer mean they'll practically be a different band.  I know it's not the first time they've had significant lineup changes though."
"Church of Misery parts ways with 3 members.","Not really.  Their bassist is the only original member, if I recall correctly, and he does most of the writing.  They've been through tons of lineup changes, and have retained more or less the same style.  "
"Church of Misery parts ways with 3 members.","That's true. That said JJ (Junji Narita) has been the drummer for 14 years now and Hideki sang on the last 3 albums. The live line-up changed and there was a new guitarist every couple of years, but the sound will completely change now.

Tatsu writes all the material so the riffs will be there, but the rest is unknown. The new album is going to be different for sure, let's hope for the best."
"Church of Misery parts ways with 3 members.","Yeah, but a vocalist is a pretty major thing to change.  I know they've had  different vocalists in the past, but it's still a pretty major change.  I'll be surprised if they come out the other side of side sounding exactly the same as they did before."
"Church of Misery parts ways with 3 members.","I hope they go back to using cleaner vocals, like on the Early Works comp.  I like the sound of the newer albums, with Houses Of The Unholy being my favorite, but I really like their earlier vocal work."

'Domo harkens back to the heyday of the gonzoid power trio’s of the hazy late 60s and early 70s, anchored to heavy clouds of screaming, wah wah driven psychedelia. If you love (early) Gary Moore, or you’re a fan of Tony McPhee (like most of us at Roadburn), and massively worship The Groundhogs‘ Split, then Domo will be surely a must for you.'

Bongripper is awesome on the list and almost worth it alone as is Eyehategod, but honestly it seems lacking right now compared to past years. I'm sure they are trying to negotiate more bands.

They also released a [new album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ArNlI5PZSs&amp;list=PLJ3duizt8tbwf59torcYenoGrCR7yx06f) recently and it's pretty good too, but sounds less like Swallow the Sun than their first."

"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","Floor?  I love this band, but I never considered them doom."
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","Same goes for DOWN's Nola album
"
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","I don't think they truly got doomy until their last two EPs, but their discography is great regardless. "
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","Yeah, Floor's sound is more on the Sludgy/ Stonery side of things. A little to upbeat for Doom in my opinion. Kyuss, Deep Purple and Blue Cheer can hardly be considered Doom either despite their ties with the genre. Nevertheless I think Decibel do a good job with their lists."
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","Great list! I was surprised to see Earth on this list. I don't think of them as Doom."
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","I love this list not because it's totally accurate, but because there's a TON of stuff here I've never listened to before. So much to check out. "
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","As much as I like the band and the album there is no way in hell Pallbearer's Foundations of Burden should be higher than Sorrow and Extinction. Swap the two and I feel they are roughly in the right spot. Time will do well for both albums though as I feel they are classic material, Sorrow was practically a classic offering as soon as it came out."
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","I agree, Sorrow and Extinction is a brilliant release. I suppose it's a bit hard placing Foundations' because it's so new, undeniably great though. I'm excited for Pallbearer's future, Pallbearer and YOB are killing it at the moment. "
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","more yob, and should be higher on the list"
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","This list is bad."
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","No Swallow the Sun? Those guys are masters of doom"
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","How did Goatsnake not make the list?"
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","Considering their criteria for doom in this case, no Neurosis either?"
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","Kyuss is on here? Okay...


Calling dopesmoker Jerusalem dunno how I feel about that.


Eyehategod should be much higher on the list. Pallbearer shouldn't be higher than any of their albums.

Bands that are sadly missing: Acid King, Conan, Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine, Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats, High on Fire, Jex Thoth, Manilla Road, OM.

Would've really liked to seen mention of Amebix and Sacrilege."
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","I guess 100 albums makes for a pretty big list to fill but 5 Black Sabbath Albums in the top 25 seems like a bit much"
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","It's one of those catch 22 situations because the importance of those albums can't be stressed enough, but in terms of list writing...it's a lot less interesting if you're obligated to add the biggest bands on the planet several times. Maybe they should have capped it at three album max for each artist but that would mean choosing between the first four Sab' albums! "
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","I guess its just personal preference but I feel Watching From A Distance should be a bit higher and Take As Needed For Pain could drop a few steps. Also, I don't really feel that type o is doom. I like them, but they feel out of place. "
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","Type O Negative - Death Penalty (1996)



WTF?



Edit: Guess they meant October Rust but dun goofed with Witchfinder General. And... no World Coming Down? Now, that's a shame..."
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","See also the epic typo that is...Celestial Season-Salad lovers 

Yeah I'm not to sure who typed this up because I found it on a forum (had to flip the order so that the numbers displayed properly though) but there's a lot of typos. It could have originally been a member of the Decibel staff though."
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","I'll go ahead and throw my opinion out here --- Take subrosa off that list. I don't see Acid King on here at all. I don't see Cough. I don't see THOU. This list is garbage."
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","I'd like to see one of the post-reunion YOB albums on there too."
"Decibel's 100 Doom Metal albums of all time list","Quantum Mystic should've been their choice, the great cessation is kind of a snoozer, but I mean that in comparison to other YOB albums. Such a solid fucking band."

"Horsehunter - Stoned To Death","Well man, what can I say? I don't disagree. However if tell me and others in /r/doom what you are looking for and enjoy in stoner/doom/sludge bands, people will give recommendations. For me it's the likes of Church Of Misery, Stoned Jesus, Demonic Death Judge, Windhand or Major Kong with some extra grooviness and jammy feel, you might like something completely else.

I can also link great lesser known bands from other genres, if you collect LPs and are into classics, you should enjoy [Blues Pills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh4Uw-W7I-4), to me it's Janis Joplin meets Jimi Hendrix with a little modern twist, the guitarist is just 19.

"Electric Wizard - Mountains of Mars","I've been wanting to learn how to play bass guitar recently, is it worth learning at all?"
"Electric Wizard - Mountains of Mars","It really depends on your determination and past experience with music theory/other instruments. It also depends on how much spare time you have. Even if it's just a few minutes every other day, you need to practice regularly. There's a lot to learn if it's your first instrument, but if you really think you're interested I suggest picking up a guitar and amp, maybe do lessons, try learning some tabs, see if you actually stick with it. That's really the only way to know for sure if it's for you."

"Smaller Doom bands with unique sounds","Two Finnish bands that are worth checking out-

Horse latitudes: https://horselatitudes.bandcamp.com/album/gathering

Dark Buddha Rising:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Vg9hZUYgfs

Both play slow, heavy, dark &amp; ritualistic sounding music. DBR are more drone/atmospheric."
"Smaller Doom bands with unique sounds","Listened to both of these on occasion, so I'll try some more of them for sure."
"Smaller Doom bands with unique sounds","Mexican:


Maligno


Chilean:

AstorVoltaires

Aura Hiemis

"
"Smaller Doom bands with unique sounds","Something different? 

Necro Deathmort are an amazing electronic ambient doom two-piece, super atmospheric.

Bohren und der Club of Gore are a noir doom jazz group.

Both highly recommended and stray from the typical doom metal template while totally still being Sabbath worship, in their own way."
"Smaller Doom bands with unique sounds","Age of Taurus

Avatarium

Colloseum

"Smaller Doom bands with unique sounds","ASEETHE. Heavy, heavy drone-y doom metal from Iowa. One of the most interesting and fucking terrifying bands I've ever seen perform. Check them out on bandcamp "
"Smaller Doom bands with unique sounds","This'll be all about sludge because you're all hungover and therefore need the hair of the dog that bit you.

Graves at Sea play lovely rumbly sludge. Hear [their side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFJs2pWeSr8) of the split with Sourvein they did. (Last year!) Catchy, mid-tempo sludge riffs with alternating shrill and growly vocals. 

And if you're listening to Graves at Sea, hear [Primitive Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aC28wt2sWo), the other sludge sensation of 2013/2014 that really do need to give us a full length sometime. They're headache-inducing and actually why am I listening to this

The North of England, which is really just the South of the States but inverted and older, has a tradition of producing really heavy sludge bands.

Mistress! Brummie sludgers. Started out ripping Bayou blues but later became a sort of sludge/grind band. Someone posted a Mistress song the other day, so start with their earlier stuff for classic sludge and their later stuff for stoner grind. 

[Fudge Tunnel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4BMk8wOO0c) were noisy sludge. Big in the 90s. Their cover of Sunshine of Your Love is a good tell. Later on they did some groove metal stuff, dunno if you can stand that but sludge is naturally bluesy anyway. They're a bit like Nailbomb or some of the crossover sludge bands.

[Sea Bastard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg4wvGQP2sY) have loooooooooooong, chugging riffs. It's their thing. Maybe they want you to try and count the bars and get confused. Vocals are a bit weak.

[Bumsnogger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJI69wdBGXI) (chortle) play gutter filth. Really inspiring, feel-good music.

[Iron Monkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QBi4T4vPGQ) were the quintessential northern sludge band, even if they just sounded like EYEHATEGOD. (Say it again, this time with feeling- EYEHATEGOD. EYEHATEGOD. EYE. HATE. GOD. ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH)

[Space Witch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMAmgU4ihQw) play ""atmospheric"" sludge with wooshy spaceship noises and big open soundscapes. Bit more stonery.

And for more English sludge, [Iron Witch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKM4NQCcTn0) don't have anything unique about their sound because they sound exactly like EYEHATEGOD, but if you want some of that mid 90s existential torment through whining feedback, they're gold.

Cough are quite well known, but most people haven't heard their older stuff. Alternate between paying tribute to Electric Wizard and beating listeners over the head with Sourvein riffs. Their latest releases have all been quite shapeless, but listen to Sigellum Luciferi for what was probably the best all-around sludge album of 2008. Fast riffs, slow riffs, riffs everywhere. And they really can write good lyrics, if you can make them out under all the fuzz. I just wish they'd write shorter, punchier songs like [288 Years of Sin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dcaL_KqvHo). And bloody Acid Witch. So good.

[Shroud Eater.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpzAHhxZoG0) Really big sound for a power trio. They tend to play fast and they've got one foot in the doom metal camp.

And you guys know [13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3YpFfMxWac), where Electric Wiz's Liz got her start? Had splits with Grief and other sludgers. Big draw is that they're an all-girl band, but they play a really slow and crunchy sludge that's almost bluesless. So just redsy and greenish then. Hah. 

Happy new year, misanthropes.

"Smaller Doom bands with unique sounds","Loss is an unsigned band from Nashville that have a funeral influence. Vocals are very deep. Check out 'Cut up, depressed and alone.'

Morgion is pretty great if you like a little synth accompaniment. Do check out 'All the Glory' and 'All the Loss' in that order (two part song). Sorry I can't link to YouTube at the moment."

"Type O Negative - Bloody Kisses (A Death In Family)","Dude, if you haven't really delved into them, check out October Rust. It's a bit more accessible than some of their other stuff, but just as awesome. Also their last album, Dead Again, is phenomenal. Every song has like 10 great riffs in them. World coming down is also a great song, and album. If you couldn't tell, I fucking love Type O. Peter Steele was a great songwriter and musician."
"Type O Negative - Bloody Kisses (A Death In Family)","Shit yeah, I should listen to more of them. I listened to 3 or 4 tracks off of October Rust and the synths are killer. The lyrics are kind of bananas too. I feel like my opinion that they take themselves too seriously has been totally squashed."
"Type O Negative - Bloody Kisses (A Death In Family)","Perfect winter music!"
"Type O Negative - Bloody Kisses (A Death In Family)","Brilliant! I would NOT be on this sub right now if it hadn't been for these guys."
"Type O Negative - Bloody Kisses (A Death In Family)","Seconded. One of the best metal bands ever. They inspired thousands of people to tune way the fuck down and play slow. Now if only more people would be inspired to actually sing…"

"Clouds - If These Walls Could Speak [Atmospheric Doom, 2014]","Absolutely. This is the second song on the album, and the first one was also extremely good.

'As the head of Doommantia, Barnard explored a worldwide reach in supporting doom metal and sludge, and his name has remained among the most respected for the constant passion he put into his work. As late as Jan. 7, Ed was still helping to promote bands, and while he obviously hasn’t been as active owing to his declining health, the community around him responded in kind to his own need for support. - See more at: http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2015/01/09/r-i-p-ed-barnard-1963-2015/#sthash.0uvkWK5q.dpuf   "

"Looking for some abrasive doomy stuff that isn't just death growls over some riffs.","It's not doom, but [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QloZREyA8Xk) is what I'm thinking of. Slow, abrasive as hell but no growling like an animal. 
Thoughts?"
"Looking for some abrasive doomy stuff that isn't just death growls over some riffs.","Yob, for the most part. Theyre split fairly evenly with singing and growling. Marrow, the last song off of their latest record, though, is one of my new favorite doom tracks."
"Looking for some abrasive doomy stuff that isn't just death growls over some riffs.","Yob. I can't get into yob. The growls just ruin it for me, but the rest I like."
"Looking for some abrasive doomy stuff that isn't just death growls over some riffs.","give YOB another go. throw Atma or The Unreal Never Lived on. once you get into Mike's riffs they are much more enjoyable! 

or try bands like Aleph Null and Samothrace!"
"Looking for some abrasive doomy stuff that isn't just death growls over some riffs.","For more obvious ones you might have missed there is [Electric Wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18FNZRGfVvw) and [Reverend Bizarre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar7nMRyl32E). The band I instantly thought about was [The River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3ZljcO7xw), and just for the hell of it you might like [The Angelic Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9ZiU7ahZso)."

"Looking for some abrasive doomy stuff that isn't just death growls over some riffs.","There's a band that's vaguely similar to TAP, though I don't find them as soul imploding with the weight of the universe as TAP, called [Nadja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgl3AK8php8) if you want more stuff like that.

Knowing a bit about your tastes now I'd recommend giving [this album by Suma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3-Qa81nFhs) a listen. Another good one is [Ocean Chief](http://oceanchief.bandcamp.com/album/sten). Possibly [Omega Massif](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLxZTqKgOf4) as well, even though they are instrumental.

"Gear Alert for Little Rock","Hey Reddit,

I'm in Beneath Oblivion and we're out on tour right now. Our Haulmark trailer that we borrowed from our good friends in Fister was stolen last night. Please keep an eye out for 3 custom 6x12 omega cabinets with a red wine grill frame, a Warwick corvette with passive pickups, black Ibanez custom, Gibson Les Paul, premier drum kit with a crack on the kick shell and all in SKB cases, Peavey 5150 in a case, Laney GHL 100 in a case, Eden WT500 with power conditioner in an SKB case, along with all our cash and merch. We were at the Holiday Inn on Talley road in Little Rock."
"Gear Alert for Little Rock","Also has a white Squire P bass, white Fender tele, swr 350 head in an SKB case, drum hardware and symbols, various pedals."
"Gear Alert for Little Rock","That sucks hard, but let this be a reminder to ask the other people hitting the road.  SOMEONE HAS TO SLEEP IN THE VAN.  I don't care what the temp is, I don't care if you're in your drummers cousin's driveway.  You've got probably thousands of dollars worth of gear just waiting to be taken.  Put someone on watch every night."
"Gear Alert for Little Rock","I have a friend in the Pulaski County Sherriff's office... I will have him put out a few extra feelers..

and for the record, so much shit gets stolen around little rock...as far as band/equipment goes, i am totally shocked people still come there... its pathetic.
"
"Gear Alert for Little Rock","Thanks so much. It's hard to describe the heartache especially after our van died in St. Louis and we opted to rent a car, borrow the trailer and keep going."
"Gear Alert for Little Rock","I can imagine...I played a bit of bass and ran some lights and mixer back in the day, and we had our little ' studio' janked...more of a shed really but still...that feeling of losing your equipment when all you want to do is play and put on a good show...i feel for you guys and am more than happy to try to help. "

"Looking for modern doom with clean female vocals- any suggestions?","Outside of symphonic metal, which I'm not a fan off, female vocals are extremely rare in metal. 

The only doom band I can think of with clean female vocals is Blood ceremony, and they're a bit vintage sounding for my tastes.

Can anyone recommend any more modern sounding stuff, with clean female vocals (Electric wizard, but with female singing is essentially what I'm after)"
"Looking for modern doom with clean female vocals- any suggestions?","Surprised no one has said Acid King yet. http://youtu.be/oc71A4_MguQ"
"Looking for modern doom with clean female vocals- any suggestions?","Uzala

Windhand

Witch Mountain"
"Looking for modern doom with clean female vocals- any suggestions?","[Windhand](http://windhandva.bandcamp.com/) is the closest I can think of off hand.

Not quite Electric Wizard sounding but also worth a look are [The River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16A9ELSEWPA), [Acid King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6eNI3r2gEI), [Witch Mountain](http://witchmountain.bandcamp.com/album/cauldron-of-the-wild), [Uzala](http://uzala.bandcamp.com/album/tales-of-blood-fire-2). If you're ok with sludge vocals [Salome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb0uzILAYC0) is pretty good."
"Looking for modern doom with clean female vocals- any suggestions?","Hmmm, Jex Thoth and SubRosa come to mind, but I'm not sure if that is exactly what you're looking for. Check out SubRosa's second album and see how you like it."
"Looking for modern doom with clean female vocals- any suggestions?","Not entirely Electric Wizard-y but serious genre pushing, powerful doom music.

[Subrosa](https://subrosausa.bandcamp.com/) kicks serious ass.  They make regular use of violins and clean vocals.  Their music is just absolutely gorgeous and delivers on the heavy when it needs too.  The lead singer will also tend to push a lot of volume with her voice, she has an interesting and distinct sound that doesn't break in to outright yelling.  There's still plenty of harmonies and typically clean vocals.

""Ghosts of a Dead Empire"" is probably a great introduction, but the entire album ""More Constant than the Gods"" is fucking gorgeous.

"
"Looking for modern doom with clean female vocals- any suggestions?","I second this. I just discovered SubRosa recently and have become hooked. Clean female vocals over deep crushing doom is something else. Perfect combination."

"Looking for modern doom with clean female vocals- any suggestions?","The Oath, Blood Ceremony, Royal Thunder and Electric Citizen all come to mind."
"Looking for modern doom with clean female vocals- any suggestions?","[Thorr's Hammer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ57PS-5bhM) is great (yup, that's two r's). It has both clean female vocals and growling male ones.

[Avrigus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAxi-BFhO_I) might be something to check out as well, it's some sort of ""symphonic ambient doom"" according to MA.

Clean female vocals doesn't seem to be super common in doom, but there are about eight billion occult rock bands nowadays with clean female vocals. Might be something to check out, even if it's usually not super heavy. Perhaps consider looking around in /r/occultrock"

"Looking for modern doom with clean female vocals- any suggestions?","[Avatarium](http://avatariumofficial.se/)"
"Looking for modern doom with clean female vocals- any suggestions?","Castle, jex thoth, witch mountain and windhand spring to mind. 

Just have a look at last years roadburn linr up, seems like 40% of the bands were female fronted doom."
"Looking for modern doom with clean female vocals- any suggestions?","Try the first SerpentCult album, or Death Penalty. Both have clean female vocals by Michelle Nocon."

"[Atmospheric Doom/Female Vocals] Lethian Dreams - Red Silence Lodge (2014)","I feel like the guitar tone is making me think black metal, at least this new post-black wave of it.  It lacks the heavy rumble I would associate with doom.  I think this sits better next to Deafheaven, Myrkur and Wolves in the Throne Room  more than Windhand, Dark Castle or Subrosa.  

I dig it.  It's definitely the relaxing kind of metal I'm increasingly fond of these days, but it doesn't seem doomy to me.  If that's how they're being labeled I think it's silly, and a detriment to sensible genre labeling.

I had the fortune of photographing Black Tusk very early in my adventure. By my count, they were the 4th show in which I tried my hand at concert photography; the first show I took my then 13 year old son to, and the last show that took place at the now-defunct Boise Venue.

"The Doors-The end (psychedelic proto-doom, USA)","Bold move. But I'd say expanding what we call doom and identifying pre-metal examples is a cool way of keeping the sub interesting. "
"The Doors-The end (psychedelic proto-doom, USA)","It's one of the first answers in our FAQ.

I added the ""yes, please post non-doom too, as long as it's something doom fans might like"" thing early on, because there's so much out there that many people in this sub would find fascinating.

Plus, it's just fun to dig through the bones of doom's ancestors."
"The Doors-The end (psychedelic proto-doom, USA)","I know I may get some mad down votes for this, but I  personally feel in my opinion that this is a proto doom song. It's based around three chords, it's slow, it talks about death, it is trippy, it zones you the fuck out, it makes you want to smoke mad pot. Yeah, this be some old school non metal doom."
"The Doors-The end (psychedelic proto-doom, USA)","This and ""She's so Heavy"" by the beatles are some of the earliest doom sounds in my opinion."

"The Doors-The end (psychedelic proto-doom, USA)","Oh man! My favourite band, Type O Negative, covered that. They're not the typical doom band, but their cover is super doomy. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMVKpDbVxBs) it is. They sung three songs by the Beatles in this medley."

"Looking for neo-folk-infused doom","I'm aware of such bands as [Uaral](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Uaral/25123) and [Corrupted](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Corrupted/17630) both of which have some neo-folk influences but don't really embrace the full neo-folk sound like some other non-metal bands that I'm aware of (e.g. [Nebelung](https://nebelung.bandcamp.com/) or [Raflum](https://raflum.bandcamp.com/)).

What I like most about neo-folk is the soft, melancholic sad sound, and the strong association with nature that is often present in the lyrics and ambient sounds (e.g. running water).

All subgenres of Doom are acceptable to me, just so long as there is some definite neo-folk influence. Let me know if more examples are necessary."
"Looking for neo-folk-infused doom","Agalloch is pretty much the quintessential neo-folk/doom band for me. They have many great albums, some filled with harsh metal, some with pure acoustics and chanting, and some in between. So if you don't like the first song you listen give some others a try as well. "
"Looking for neo-folk-infused doom","Interesting, I've never really thought of Agalloch as much of a doom band (more black metal), but you're right, there are some pretty doomy tracks. Thanks!"

Was coming back from Vegas recently on the shittiest plane I have ever been on. I had been awake for 30 some hours and was just in a state of daze I guess. Kind of buzzed, kind of really fucking tired, kind of hung over. Going from Vegas to Philly and it's about 3:30AM EST so my sense of time is all fucked up and we're about half way through the flight when we hit the most ridiculous turbulence I have ever encountered in my entire life; it felt like the plane would drop 30 feet then jar to the right. Shit is falling out of the cabinets, people are getting sick, it was intense. This entire time I'm jamming out in the very last seat of the plane to Earthless - From the Ages and it was just a really odd, kind of awesome experience. Just really trippy.

TL;DR - Was in a death plane, thought I was going to die, but was okay cuz jamming to Earthless."

"ELECTRIC WIZARD US TOUR DATES BEING RELEASED TODAY","It's not terrible, but the sound isn't great, the staff tend to be assholes, drinks are expensive, and it's pretty much impossible to find parking in that neighborhood. (Take the bus if you can.)

"ELECTRIC WIZARD US TOUR DATES BEING RELEASED TODAY","i have to push back against soy_reindeer. neumos is awesome. they have one of the best sound systems in seattle, book a wide range of acts, and their staff is comparable to any other venue in the area. parking is a bitch, but no one really expects to find decent parking in seattle. its kind of a bitchy complaint. loudest show i've ever seen was there, the melvins with jello biafra. ear bleeding loud. ive also seen some killer electronic shows there, too- autechre and plaid were probably the best. if i was to pick any venue to see electric wizard, it would be neumos."

"My doom (doomwave) band Blood Sugar Summer, see what you think","Reminds me of Type O-Negative circa October Rust. 

The vocals seemed really off to me, especially on Birthed by Wolves. Most Photographed was definitely the best track of the three."
"My doom (doomwave) band Blood Sugar Summer, see what you think","Thank you. And 'October Rust' is our favourite record as a band, by far. "
"My doom (doomwave) band Blood Sugar Summer, see what you think","too 80's for me dude. thanks for sharing though, if you dig it keep doing it."
"My doom (doomwave) band Blood Sugar Summer, see what you think","Cheers pal. "
"My doom (doomwave) band Blood Sugar Summer, see what you think","I love both 80s music and doom so I think this is an interesting idea. I wasn't hearing much of the doom influence until halfway through ""Birthed By Wolves,"" where it came pretty suddenly and the transition was a little jarring. I think ""Haunted"" and ""The Most Photographed Woman on the Planet"" do a better job of balancing the doom and new wave aesthetics, and the vocal performance is better on those tracks as well. Although you tried to mix things up with synth progressions, ""Haunted"" gets a little repetitive, and I think if you're going to mix these genres it might be a better idea to borrow more from the song structures of new wave rather than the glacial pace of doom. Overall though I enjoyed the songs, and while I never would have thought I'd hear a mixture of doom and new wave, it does make sense given the aesthetics and instrumentation of the genres. Keep up the interesting work."
"My doom (doomwave) band Blood Sugar Summer, see what you think","Yeah, ""BBW"" has a big doom breakdown. I agree ""Haunted"" gets repetitive. I also agree I was pretty lazy doing the vox for ""BBW"". They're not as inspired as on the other tracks. Glad you enjoyed it :)"

"NEVER listen to Sunn O))) whilst jogging.","I decided to try and get into Sunn O))) (Aghartha) on my way to work today. I was late, so I broke into a light jog. Sunn 0))) is bad running music...so much so that it sounded like my journey had transformed into a depressing 70s sci fi where if I didn't get there on time, humanity and life itself would be erased from reality and have never existed, leaving behind a pure nothingness vacant of the despair it would otherwise invoke."
"NEVER listen to Sunn O))) whilst jogging.","Yes, Sunn 0)) is bad running music, however on the plus side you GOT Sunn 0)). j/k I wouldn't say I LOVE Sunn 0)) but it is mood and time specific. For example I have Sunn 0)) on right now but its pitch dark out, I just got up, I don't want to wake the wife and dogs but want something to listen to, that I don't want to sing to, just kinda zone out whilst drinking my coffee and peruse the internet. If you decide to give Sunn 0)) another shot, go see them live. Even people I know that don't like Sunn 0)) that see them live say its an experience you NEED TO HAVE. Bring earplugs."

I see your point how ever ""It took the night to believe"" is one of my personal favorite Sunn 0))) tracks. Throwing down the youtube link for that one was like a reflex. 

""Arguably"" is it A-typical? Sure. Does the track convey mood, tone, feeling, depth, overall ""menacing nature"" of Sunn 0)))  Yes it does. I would argue to say its worth checking out to explore the ""range"" of the bands spectrum as a whole."
"NEVER listen to Sunn O))) whilst jogging.","I hear you on the reflex action. Sunn O))) def have a wide range of stuff in their discog in any case! It Took The Night To Believe almost has a black metal feel to it, for me. ANyhoo, hopefully your links do help the guy get into them :D"

"NEVER listen to Sunn O))) whilst jogging.","I probably saw them in '05 or so in a tiny legion hall where the PA started to smoke with the opener (about 14 mos after the Station Night club disaster and we were probly 45 mins from there) so I got drug out by my shirt when my buddy noticed it. ANYWAY. Sunn 0))) was just surreal. I was mostly sober. I had a few beers but no drugs. The fog, the robes, the claustrophobia , and distance made me nauseous. I had never seen a band more dedicated to their ""gimmick"" but it was so interesting and dramatic. It was easily 10 mins between the time they took the stage and  when they started playing. Seemed like an hour. Just standing there. Once the guitar came up, the fog cleared enough to make out shadowy ominous figures. The volume was staggering. I mean it was a gross abuse of capability . I've seen some loud ass shows. Sunn 0)))   was up there as one of the loudest. I mean not only could I feel it, but it affected my vision and sense of balance. I could literally see the paneling on the walls shaking. So intense."
"NEVER listen to Sunn O))) whilst jogging.","Saw Sunn0))) in 2002 on the same bill as the Ex and !!! (think about that for a second) at the Empty Bottle in Chicago. Single loudest and most amazing set I've ever seen. Every guitar strum literally lifted me off the floor. "

Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine were slow and heavy but not fully drone. Khanate were slow but more sparse than drone - still excellent of course. Sleep's Dopesmoker maybe? 

I've been digging youtube videos of shit slowed down. Like the BBC Radiophonic Workshop'd Doctor Who theme slowed right down is utterly brilliant for example.

&gt;The lyrics of early [traditional blues verses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_blues_verse) probably often consisted of a single line repeated four times. It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the so-called AAB pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars.  Two of the first published blues songs, ""[Dallas Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Blues)"" (1912) and ""[Saint Louis Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Louis_Blues_(song\))"" (1914), were 12-bar blues featuring the AAB structure. [W. C. Handy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._C._Handy) wrote that he adopted this convention to avoid the monotony of lines repeated three times.  The lines are often sung following a pattern closer to a [rhythmic talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_blues) than to a melody.

"Ghost - Genesis EPIC track we can ALL appreciate! \m/","Whats being sung and how its delivered are two entirely different things man. Youre saying that the lyrical content defines a genre. That just simply isnt true. "
"Ghost - Genesis EPIC track we can ALL appreciate! \m/","How we say things, and what we say often go hand in hand. I'm saying lyrics can help define a bands genre, but it is not the only thing. 

Are you saying lyrics have no value at all to an artist and their work?"
"Ghost - Genesis EPIC track we can ALL appreciate! \m/","Woah, when did I ever say that? Lyrics can have value, but music ultimately means more. Genres can have lyrics that are typical of them or stereotypical even, but the lyrics dont define the genre. "
"Ghost - Genesis EPIC track we can ALL appreciate! \m/","I think we are kind of on the same page to be honest. Lyrics are not genre defining in and of itself (although I think parody/comedy music can mostly be defined by lyrical content alone), but CAN play a role in defining music genres along with the music itself. 

To be fair this would be a much better discussion in person."
"Ghost - Genesis EPIC track we can ALL appreciate! \m/","Doom metal has always been in love with organ-driven 70s rock

Theyre totally gay for each other"
"Ghost - Genesis EPIC track we can ALL appreciate! \m/","they have relation and a little cross over, ill give you that, but so do thrash metal and hardcore punk, and you wouldnt call Dead Kennedy's a thrash band. Im sure people who enjoy doom metal also enjoy occult themed spooky rock, but that doesnt make it doom. id say theyre more like cousins that occasionally have some no-no thoughts about each other. "

"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Hey guys. I'm the son of Wino and I was just wondering is he big or famous on this sub? And by the way is the subscribers line referencing his Saint Vitus song, Born Too Late? I love his music, especially his Spirit Caravan and Saint Vitus stuff, but since I'm fairly new to Reddit, I figured I would ask. If you search Scott Weinrich kids on google images I'm in the first picture with no shirt on haha. And just a heads up, he's still playing music even after what happened :). Long live Wino.

Edit: He said he would probably do an AMA, on Friday probably, should he post it here or on an AMA subreddit?"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","He should do an AMA"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","AMA! AMA!"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","He said he would. Would it be here or on an AMA subreddit?"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","That is entirely up to y'all. If you go with the AMA subreddit you'll get a vast and varied audience as it is a default, as well as a quite large sub.

If it is done here, you'll just get the folks that have a more specified interested in the music and probably better questions/response yet the scale of the AMA would be smaller. Either way, it's all good. 

By the way, can I be friends with you guys? :) "

"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Hey, I saw your dad in philly a few weeks ago.  Spirit Caravan is legendary!"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","I know! I love Jug Fulla Sun and the Elusive Truth!"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Hey, bruh. Of course your old man is legend. I got into his work in about '98 and have followed pretty much all his projects. My battle jacket has always had prominent The Obsessed and Saint Vitus patches. 

Welcome to reddit and have a good time here. "
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Thanks! He's awesome, and I idolize him."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Your dad's a cool mother fucker.  I loved him in the documentary ""Such Hawks, Such Hounds.""  Were you in that too?  I seem to remember a scene with his family."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Can you ask your Pops if Shrine Builder will ever tour again?"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","I saw him live with Spirit Caravan, great gig I plan to see him with Saint Vitus some time :)"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Spirit Caravan is great. Would love to read an AMA."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Quickly met your dad in the crowd at psycho last year. He's a legend."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","I met him after a St. Vitus gig and he's the realist dude ever. I've not heard everything Wino has put out, Shrine builder and his solo albums are glaring ommisions, but Spirit Caravan, The Obsessed, Saint Vitus, Hidden Hand are all solid gold. 

As for your question is he famous on this sub, then I'd struggle to think of a man that this sub would genuinely love more than Wino other than Iommi."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Shrinebuilder is really good."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Bobby Libeling, Dave Chandler, Albert Witchfinder, Magnus Pilander, Mike Williams, Jus Oborn, Al Cisneros, Matt Pike, Lori S. I could go on ..."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Now that you mention it I WOULD like an AMA with Bobby Liebling..."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","He's very garrulous - good box office all round, if it were to happen."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Ask him to post the AMA on this sub, thanks for asking him btw, it'll definitely make a lot of fans on the doom metal subreddit happy. Anyways your dad's band Saint Vitus is one of the bands that really got me deeper into doom metal, and if it wasn't for him I probably wouldn't have found my way into this incredible genre of music. Tell him Reddit says thanks in advance! Not just for the AMA, but for the amazing things he's done for the genre."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Dude, Wino is like the friggin' GOD of Doom metal! I think you'd be hard pressed to find a doomster who doesn't know him.  I'm sure we all love if it he came for a little while and did an AMA, like /u/Eluzim said."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","I just texted him and he said he would probably do one, should he post it here, or on an AMA sub?"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","I'd say do it in the AMA subreddit. Its better equipped for that, and might get some exposure beyond just our humble group."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","In fact, it might give some exposure to our humble sub. "
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Kind of hard to say. I don't know that it would get much traction on the AMA sub, and probably most people on reddit who listen to doom and stoner are probably already subscribed here. Maybe do it in /r/metal?"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Well, it seems he'd get the best attention either here or /r/metal, since, despite his renown here, he's very underground with regards to  the mainstream. "
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","That's really awesome! Are you involved in his music besides occasionally listening to it? Id be jamming with him and recording every other day if I was you"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Is your Dad all cool about letting you play his guitars and amps and stuff?"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Yeah, he gave me two of his guitars and an amp and I can play decently well."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","That's so badass! Looking forward to the AMA, please keep us posted dude! \m/"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Saw your dad in December! He's the man! Love The Obsessed, St. Vitus etc..."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","[deleted]"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Proof?"
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","I'm a Huge fan. Saw him with Spirit Caravan &amp; Shrinebuilder. 

I like his solo album from 2009. I'm also a big fan of A Hidden Hand, especially the 'Mother Teacher Destroyer' album. "
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","To say your father is a significant figure in Doom is a bit like saying a Tyrannosaurus Rex was rather large and mildly carnivorous. Saw him and the rest of Vitus in 2013. Was very sad to hear what happened recently too, but I'm minded of what he said at that gig: ""You're all Princes and Princesses, and don't let anyone make you think otherwise."" That helped a great deal. So please send my thanks, for everything."
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Yes and yes. Pretty sure /u/this_time_i_mean_it is the one responsible for editing the subscribers line in honor of your pops. It's been like that for a couple of years now. "
"Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's son","Yep, that was my doing."

"Black Sabbath - Black Sabbath | 45th Birthday today!","And so Doommetal was born. "
"Black Sabbath - Black Sabbath | 45th Birthday today!","Something I posted in the /r/metal thread on the same subject:

&gt;This album changed my life. I was 12, not really into music in any real capacity except what I heard on the radio, some stuff my mum had on cassette. I was checking out some other cassettes and there was this old orange-coloured one with my dad's writing on it. Side A said ""Python Live"" and Side B said ""Black Sabbath"". I thought, ""Cool, Monty Python!"" and listened to it. When I got to the end of the tape I tried rewinding it to the beginning but the machine didn't like this particular tape. I sighed and put on the other side, pressed play and prepared to wait 45 minutes until the tape finished.


&gt;I heard the sound of rain, thunder, and a tolling bell. I was confused. Suddenly the first chord kicked in. I was a little unnerved. Then the singing started. WTF was this??


&gt;I'll admit to not liking it straight away but I was certainly intrigued. I listened to it several times until one day as I walked through the park listening to it on my Walkman, grey clouds rolling across the sky and rain pouring down, the first song gave me chills. *I got it now.*


&gt;Since that day I have become besotted with Black Sabbath and in particular Tony Iommi, to the point where I am in a doom/stoner band and have forced my bandmates into covering some of their songs. If I hadn't stumbled upon that old orange-coloured cassette, I wouldn't be who I am today."

Can't believe it's been 45 years. Black Sabbath was the first song I ever learnt to play on the guitar.

Early Black Sabbath was before its time! I reckon it would be a hit in doom metal if it was released today, if doom metal came to without the help of Black Sabbath that is!"

"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","It seems that a large amount of people dislike this band, why is that? "
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","The main argument I hear is whether or not Ghost is ""metal"". I say who cares? Stop being genre queens. They're basically Blue Oyster Cult with a KISS image, and you know what? It's fun. "
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","I've also heard they put on an amazing live show."
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","They put on an amazing show! They're much heavier live. "
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","I can second this.  They were great when I saw them in Atlanta."
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","Can confirm. "
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","They're quite musical and accessible compared to a lot of bands who play and sing about similar themes and thus they're popular with quite a wide audience. Of course a lot of people have trouble dealing with popular bands and claim that they're not being trve metal.

But who gives a fuck really? They're top. "
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","I really didn't like ghost at first. At times they sound really doomy, and then poppy at other times. Especially the singer. It took a lot of listens to really get into them. I guess I just adjusted to the pop factor. I also like how lyrically they sound a lot like Venom, but take an organized religion approach to the overt tongue-in-cheek satanism. I'm not really a fan of the second album though, maybe I just need to listen to it more. "
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","I love that band until the vocals kick in. "
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","Really? I think he has a fantastic voice. One of the few clean vocalists I like. "
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","100% agree"
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","I certainly don't hate Ghost, so I can't speak for anyone that does, and I'm certainly fine with the idea of them. It's just that for me, they aren't anything special. Instrumentally, they're just kinda eh. Their riffs aren't very original and there isn't much for me to grab onto. The hooks are pretty catchy for sure, but that's not enough alone sell them for me. Again, I don't hate them but I don't seek out listening to them on my own."
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","Same for me, there's just nothing for me to grab on to with them, especially with their second album. I also really dislike their cover of the Roky Erickson tune"
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","Good music is subjective. They just seem to vastly polarize people. I love them, musically they are okay. Its the image and the theatrics I love. It may sound cheesy, but they seem to put out this Halloween-""ey"" vibe. Its something different I guess. I love Papa's voice. The clean vocals are a nice departure from traditional doom."
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","I dont hate them at all. I've never seen them live but from what I heard and from what the other folks on this thread say they put out a really kickass show. And thats really important for a band. Also I find the whole retro occult rock revival really cool. And I enjoy that very much.

And I couldn't agree more with /u/riggard ""They're basically Blue Oyster Cult with a KISS image, and you know what? It's fun.""

"
"ELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?","My main issue with them is that we keep getting new mediocre ghost records instead of a new repugnant record. From what I understand, the second album is already written, but will likely never see the light of day because he's never going to dedicate time to repugnant as long as ghost records keep selling like they do. Also I find ghost pretty boring over all. Not terrible, but nothing worth getting too excited about"

"There is Doom, and then there is CORRUPTED","Eh. It's just alright to me. I've heard so many low-growl/low-fidelity bands that this isn't too separate from the pack.

Is there anything else by them you could recommend in case it's just this particular song?"
"There is Doom, and then there is CORRUPTED","The majority of their discography is 7inch splits, so most MP3s/vids are sourced from those.  These guys have been kicking it since the early 90s, I like to think that many of the guttural bands take their cue from Corrupted.

Here's a track from a CD release:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaKy_mEGiBU


If you'd like high fidelity, then I would like for you to listen to their epic masterpiece El Mundo Frio.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgPUqdOsU5U



They're a Japanese band and their policy in the 90s was no pictures, no interviews, all words/vocals in Spanish.  They didn't want anyone in Japan to know or understand them.

"Black Sabbath Planning Final Album and World Tour.","Obligatory Ward post: I think if they were to do a final anything they should shoot for Bill again, I read an interview saying he was trying to get back in shape (Sabbath shape). I wish the best for him and hope he is somehow included for their next endeavor.. Kind of disappointed they're going to choose Rick Rubin again because '13' sounded garbage-like. The best thing that guy ever did was Danzig's early outings, he's toast now.

"Pallbearer - Worlds Apart","seriously, where do you live, /u/turboturd500 ?"
"Pallbearer - Worlds Apart","A small, middle of nowhere town with a population less than 200. It's so unbelievably dead, **even the bar shut down**...

However, my newer car has an XM Satellite radio receiver in it and I get the channel called Liquid Metal. They play pretty much every type of metal you could imagine. They have some awesome interviews from people in various metal genre's, and occasionally they even let the artists take over and play the stuff that they were influenced by. Sometimes they play more mainstream stuff (Slipknot, Upon a Burning Body, etc.), and sometimes they play some surprisingly underground stuff (Portal, Destroyer 666, etc.). There's no censorship either which is a definite plus. Here's the website if you want to learn more.

http://www.siriusxm.com/liquidmetal"
"Pallbearer - Worlds Apart","Ah liquid metal i had XM years ago when they had this awesome cult metal show I think it was called Ultra Violence. I always called in and would never get my suggestions played :-/ "

"Pallbearer - Worlds Apart","Great band!  Had the pleasure of seeing their set in Chicago last week."
"Pallbearer - Worlds Apart","I'm a huge fan of Pallbearer, but Foundations of Burden just doesn't grip me like Sorrow and Extinction does. I guess it just feels a bit more mainstream or not as unique? I can (and have) listen to Sorrow and Extinction multiple times in a day and enjoy it just as much the first time I heard the album. I'm certainly not saying that Foundations of Burden isn't a good album, either. I think it's an amazing album, I just wish that it sounded more like Sorrow and Extinction did. "
"Pallbearer - Worlds Apart","I love the writing from these guys, but oh boy do they struggle to pull it off live ..."
"Pallbearer - Worlds Apart","Wow, really? I've seen them live three times, and they were great all three shows. Wonder if I got lucky, or if you saw them on a bad night."
"Pallbearer - Worlds Apart","I never really got into the whole dreary modern doom metal sound like Pallbearer, Warning or 40 Watt Sun try to pull off. It just ends up being too monotonous for me."

I always thought the Wartell/Franklin guitars were the main thing, but their fork of the band (who is now Trouble), hasn't kept much of that ol' doom sound, and they don't pick very good singers. 

Wagner sure can sing, and seems to be pursuing the more of the original Psalm-69-era doom vision. Very nice, hope they come around so I can see them live."

Regardless, I really liked the vibe King Dude put on, and my wife really enjoyed it as well.  And I got some killer shots out of the deal.

This is one of the better recordings of it so I thought I'd share. I don't know what's going on with the weird pitch-shifting effects on the vocals; I only asked for reverb and delay! Would love to hear your thoughts. We're so excited to get it recorded for our new album, we've got some guitar overdubs to do, then bass and vocals. Can't wait to finish it all!!"
"Shameless self-promotion: New Buried Sleeper track ""Pangaea"" played live in Edinburgh, Scotland, 21st Feb. What do you guys think?","Pretty fucking sick, man. When that heavy riffing comes in at 3:40 and 7:00, goddamn. Your drummer has a pretty sweet deal, his playing complements the riffs really well whereas some stoner-doom bands just have these overwhelming, swelling drums at entirely unnecessary times.

Yeah, I like it a lot.

Also, got a time line on when the album may be finished? I'd definitely cop a copy if I have the cash then."

Edit: I just checked it out. This album goes really well with the first part of Samsara, which is usually tough to get through.  I could make a nice mashup with sharp cuts and stuff, but it wouldn't add that much in my opinion. I highly recommend playing this while watching Samsara though, it's on netflix."

"A little shameless self-promotion, details in comments.",""
"A little shameless self-promotion, details in comments.","Hey, guys. I'm wasn't sure about posting this because I don't feel it's really up to a good enough standard recording and mixing wise. And I hate my singing, but that's just me. I think I should just man up and share what I made.

I'm looking for suggestions as to what 'labels' fit my music. Is it stoner, is it trad doom, is it neither? I'm not sure.

The main reason for this EP is to try to attract band members who can help me write/record/perform and such, I don't want to be a one-man band for longer than I have to be. Looking for a guitarist, a bassist and a drummer in the South of England. If you're interested, chuck me a message or something.

Cheers."
"A little shameless self-promotion, details in comments.","If you don't like your singing you can experiment with burying it in the mix a bit more and making it more of background instead of foreground, so to speak. Also try using more effects on it. What you achieve by this you draw less attention to the vocals, if you don't want them to be the main focus. Examples of band that kinda do it:

* [Dopelord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsLdIZGU-_w)
* [Demonic Death Judge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=360t8y9P-QQ)
* [Windhand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziZ9w5OiyKo)

The guitars and vocals are ok in my opinion (I'd turn vocals down though), the mix needs more fuzzy bass and drumming is too repetitive and plain.

All that said, your compositions are very good and this material has much potential. All the best!"
"A little shameless self-promotion, details in comments.","Yeah, I was mixing on headphones because I haven't gotten myself a decent pair of monitors yet. The vocals seem to stand out more with some speakers than others. they were definitely more subtle in the headphones I was using to mix.

I'm already really into Windhand, I've heard the Demonic Death Judge one before and that Dopelord one is great, I'll definitely check them out more. I was going for a Jus Oborn type vocal style but I ended up probably nearer Brian Molko at times. I haven't done much singing before, I need a lot of practice.

The drumming was the weakest part in theory when I wrote everything. I'm not a drummer and I've had to teach myself so much about drums already to manage to write what I ended up with. I definitely need a drummer to collab with, that could really take the music up a few levels."
"A little shameless self-promotion, details in comments.","I'll second what Spidzior said about mixing the vocals. And don't even sweat being right on pitch. If you listen to Electic Wizard enough, you'll notice they often aren't on it all the time either. Just lower the vocals into the background, and you'll have something perfect. I personally love everything else about it. I'd volunteer to drum for you if I wasn't on the other side of the world. Sick album art too.

This is definitely some wicked stuff. Can't wait to hear more!"

I didn't even know there were any bands of this style floating around Chicago (it feels like there's only mostly punk, garage, indie, and metalcore around here).  I mean, there's Bongripper, but they're waaaaaay more doomy than these guys.   "
"Just found out about these guys from Chicago. A mix of psych, doom, and stoner. No EP, but their demos are pretty good.","There's local metal shows at Cobra Lounge regularly. Check it out.  In fact there's a pretty vibrant metal scene in the Chi, bud. 

Blue Dream is another very underground hard psych band. Young kids that look like Mott The Hoople on stage.  Saw them at Metro a couple weeks ago. Good shit. "
"Just found out about these guys from Chicago. A mix of psych, doom, and stoner. No EP, but their demos are pretty good.","Oh yes, I'm quite familiar with Cobra.  I know Eyehategod played there a few times in the last year, and I think Weedeater played there as well.  And now I'm hearing about other places, too.  

Wow, Blue Dream sounds amazing!  Thanks for telling me about them.  Another band I like, though not from Chicago, but close by, is Radio Moscow.  It just goes to show that Iowa can churn out good bands besides just Slipknot lol.  "

"Just found out about these guys from Chicago. A mix of psych, doom, and stoner. No EP, but their demos are pretty good.","I hear this often from Chicago people. Y'all have got plenty of great bands in the area. I guess there just isn't a venue for this style of music to play live?"
"Just found out about these guys from Chicago. A mix of psych, doom, and stoner. No EP, but their demos are pretty good.","My bad, I was actually referring to the underground/DIY scene, which has practically no bands like this circulating.  I've heard of some local acts like Killer Moon, Oceans of Titan, and Hypnochron that play at more legit venues, but I don't think there's any staples for stoner and doom metal (like St. Vitus Bar in NYC).  "
"Just found out about these guys from Chicago. A mix of psych, doom, and stoner. No EP, but their demos are pretty good.","Mount Salem is another band from the area that seems to play some relatively larger shows.

"Just found out about these guys from Chicago. A mix of psych, doom, and stoner. No EP, but their demos are pretty good.","Wow, didn't know about Mount Salem til you told me. I love it! Kinda reminds me of the Tony Martin era of Black Sabbath.  Which, in my opinion, is a very underrated part of the band's history.

Also, there's another Chicago band called Witchbanger that's pretty rad.  "
"Just found out about these guys from Chicago. A mix of psych, doom, and stoner. No EP, but their demos are pretty good.","There's actually a lot of good Chicago doom out there, though most of it is independent and underground. Doom acts here get to play a fair amount of venues, but unless you're Sleep the biggest venue for doom here is probably Reggie's Rock Club. Make sure to check out Bongripper if you haven't!

"Just found out about these guys from Chicago. A mix of psych, doom, and stoner. No EP, but their demos are pretty good.","We have shit tons of venues. This kid just hasn't had a chance to find them yet. Even though we don't have a joint that claims its a ""Doom Bar"" in some overpriced hipster burrough doesn't mean we're lacking for entertainment here. There are tons of places to go that support metal, although punk does tend to get a bit more visibility. But that's just because of the history of the city. This has been a largely street punk / skinhead dominated scene for decades. Even east coast hardcore bands were afraid to play here due to the violence. The punk mentality is sort of ingrained. "
"Just found out about these guys from Chicago. A mix of psych, doom, and stoner. No EP, but their demos are pretty good.","I just recently learned that some good venues for doom have been Double Door and the Subterranean (which is so close to DD).  I already knew about Cobra Lounge, though I didn't know they had so many doom acts come through.

And yes, I've always heard stories about Chicago's punk roots.  I have quite a few friends who are followers of the recent punk scene, and from what they say it seems like there's a never-ending supply of booze and basement shows.  Now THAT is what I call preservation!  "
"Just found out about these guys from Chicago. A mix of psych, doom, and stoner. No EP, but their demos are pretty good.","DD and SubT are both good. Empty Bottle is probably the best place for amazing shit that still hasn't quite come to the attention of the masses. "

"Anyone else pre-order Holy Mountain from Earache yet?","Honestly, I almost didn't want to order it through them, just so that I wasn't supporting Earache's shadiness surrounding what is a near perfect release and what is one of my all time favorite records period. Then I thought to myself how absurdly priced these things will be on ebay. So fuck it, I got one of the blue/black's out of /200 They've already sold out of all colors but black. I'll happily go see SLEEP the next time they're in NY and give them all of my money that way. Anyone score a green copy??"
"Anyone else pre-order Holy Mountain from Earache yet?","Fuck Earache. Those scumbags signed Sleep to a shitty contract and the band gets nothing when that album is sold. Do music a favor—cancel your order and never buy anything from the parasites at Earache.

I spent a lot of late nights walking along the river here in town, 4 am, listening to this CD on my old walkman. I didn't even have an mp3 player yet. It really brings me back to that summer.

"Looking for a new amplifier. Suggestions.","Looking for maybe something similar to a Sunn sounding amp to bring out the potential of my SG. Anyway I know precisely nothing about amplification so it's hard to be specific about what I want. Also what do you guys use? (name your axe and peds too)"
"Looking for a new amplifier. Suggestions.","The guitarist in my band plays a Verellen Loucks. Hand built amp that is basically made for doom. To me it sounds just like a sunn model T but is much MUCH louder. Absolutely the loudest amp I've ever heard. if you run a full stack with it, you can crush rooms. "
"Looking for a new amplifier. Suggestions.","[deleted]"
"Looking for a new amplifier. Suggestions.","If you're strapped for cash there are pedals out there that can mimic the Model T sound for just a few hundred, as opposed to the $1200-$1500 you'd pay for a new Model T clone."
"Looking for a new amplifier. Suggestions.","Interesting... "
"Looking for a new amplifier. Suggestions.","Yeah, there's some guy that sells a pedal on Etsy for around $200 that mimics the sound of the Model T. Sounds pretty close."
"Looking for a new amplifier. Suggestions.","Also, if you're on a budget, definitely just get a beta lead or two. They're loud as fuck and have a great tone. They used to go for around 350, they might be up to 500 now, but if you hunt craigslist, you can find a good deal. Really killer for the price. "
"Looking for a new amplifier. Suggestions.","I use a Traynor YBA-3 with an acoustic 4x12. It's 120 watts so it's got plenty of headroom, but you can get it to break up nicely if you want. Very similar to an ampeg v4. For distortion I use a rat and a boss hm-2 that's a little screwed up and sounds more like a fuzz now. Guitar is a les paul and sometimes a parts strat I made. "
"Looking for a new amplifier. Suggestions.","You should check out [Hovercraft Amps](http://www.hovercraftamps.com/). They do a bunch of Sunn-style stuff for pretty reasonable prices.

Otherwise, look into some of [Correct Sound's](https://reverb.com/shop/olegs-shop) stuff. The make a bunch of Sunn flavored pedals, including a [Model T preamp in a box](https://reverb.com/item/71199-correct-sound-custom-mt-tube-preamp-2014).

"Writing lyrics [discussion]","So I've been working on some songs for a new band. Musically, it feels so naturally playing/writing this type of music and some songs I've been working on already have lyrics but my question is, what is a good approach for writing doom metal lyrics? I've written about things such as addiction, disease, depression, and death. It's just that I can only write about the same thing so many times before it's all the same, you know? 

How do you write in a way that fits the style without letting it all sound the same? As well as how to avoid sounding too angsty too of course."
"Writing lyrics [discussion]","I don't write lyrics but as a listener let me just say that if you're running out of steam don't push it, it's better to steer the theme to some more abstract or fictional concepts (like Sleep singing about weed caravans dragging across the desert) than to just hammer in subjects that are spent. 

Let your imagination run wild, it fits the music and should solve your problem."
"Writing lyrics [discussion]","Angsty usually means ""overdramatic"" or coming across as silly and immature. I suppose you could call some of the Wizard's stuff ""angsty"", but ""We Hate You"" isn't about drama. They just fuckin' hate you. I think the kicker here is to not take any of it too seriously."
"Writing lyrics [discussion]","What I do sometimes is write sort of a story and give it shape as lyrics. Usually I'll get one line or so in my head and then rush to write it down and get as much as I can out of one writing session and usually I can come back to it where I left off. Or I think of very basic themes like the elements to start from and make it more specific and personal

Also when I want to write but don't have any ideas I put on music that has a similar feel for what I want to write, but I don't listen for the lyrics I just listen for a certain atmosphere to put my head in. I then stop the music when I start writing and only listen to it before lest it distracts me or I write something too similar."
"Writing lyrics [discussion]","I have a pretty similar approach"
"Writing lyrics [discussion]","I think to avoid having your writings sound the same, come up with several ideas or themes and once you use one, try to throw it in the back and go through the others so when you use it again its been awhile and you won't be thinking about what you already wrote using it. Or look at the theme from all its angles and attributes to see exactly where the lyrics can come from. That was hard to put that into words, but do you get what I mean?"
"Writing lyrics [discussion]","Occult/Satanic lyrics are often in doom metal such as Candlemass and Ghost."
"Writing lyrics [discussion]","Write about monsters."

"When did the Doom scene become a thing?","We all know the history of the genre, Black Sabbath in the 70s etc., but when did people start using the term doom metal? When did people say that bands like Saint Vitus, Trouble, Candlemass, and Saint Vitus are doom? Additionally, when did it start to become a defined scene?"
"When did the Doom scene become a thing?","The term ""Doom"" goes back at least as far as the first Trouble record (Psalm 9/""Trouble"") in 1984 and may go back further. In a very specific sense, the longest-running doom band is Pentagram, who have been playing in pretty much the same style since 1971. Most fans agree, however, that the scene takes it's name from Candlemass' Epicus Doomicus Metallicus. 

Doom as a reasonably well-defined scene goes back to the early 90's at least, but this sort of depends on *where* you're talking about. Chicago for the most part always had a doom scene, with St. Vitus and Trouble playing there with regularity since the mid-80's. London and Manchester both have doom scenes that go back that far as well. "
"When did the Doom scene become a thing?","There's a really good documentary on this! You can watch the trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyJ2nZGUfcY). I'm sure you can watch this movie online somewhere. I found it very enjoyable and I learned a couple of things too."
"When did the Doom scene become a thing?","sup.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkdmwKXNXAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkdmwKXNXAQ)"
"When did the Doom scene become a thing?","I have seen it recently. I'm talking less about which band started when,  but when people like us came together and started grouping these bands together, I'm sure by the late 80s."
"When did the Doom scene become a thing?","I think that the *current* doom scene popped up in the last few years due to streaming services. Until then it was always hard to find out much about doom because there was almost no media coverage and most record stores didn’t carry the albums. So just because you liked Sleep or UFOmammut doesn’t mean you would learn about the other. But then Pandora, Last.fm, and Spotify turned up and in an hour you could find out about more doom bands than you’d heard of in a decade. 

Of course there were other doom scenes before this. But as several other posters already pointed out, those were local scenes."
"When did the Doom scene become a thing?","In NWOBHM there's more than a few bands (Witchfinder General, Pagan Altar, Requiem, Tellurian) that shared a similar doomy sound but weren't united in any geographical sense (different English towns etc) or shared any identity. A lot of acts we consider staples of doom have never called themselves by that label, or only accept that category for convenience given that they share the sound with other bands.

I see Warning and 40 Watt Sun posted here often but Patrick Walker insists neither band plays doom metal, even though the former were signed to the Miskatonic Foundation which specialised in distributing UK doom and darker NWOBHM.

I remember some of Cathedral's early albums having a list of similar bands they respected, and that sort of thing was key to finding doom metal in the days before internet streaming. Years and years ago I went looking for Moss after seeing the hail in *Come My Fanatics*... and, though I was disappointed with the quality of what I heard, I felt a loyalty to support them given that it was hard to find that sort of music.

And I guess that's also why we post a lot of sludge, drone, stoner and occult here. Esoteric had a squabble with Electric Wizard in the 90s where they denounced them for not being true doom but they play funeral anyway lol. 
It's pointless to fuss over what is and isn't doom because that's such a nebulous idea and there's no historical doom ideology shared by all doomy bands. People who got into doom yesterday have it so easy. There's every band under the sun on the internet. It's beautiful."
"When did the Doom scene become a thing?","Doom analysis on point tho"
"When did the Doom scene become a thing?","Probably around the time of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus by Candlemass."
"When did the Doom scene become a thing?","I knew a guy in high school, around 1997 or so, who lent me some metal tapes including Sleep and Mindrot. I remember him using the name doom metal, so it would have been by then at least.

...and I just found out the drummer from Mindrot wound up in Save Ferris. Would not have guessed that. "

"Your top 5/6/42 doom albums of all time?","Pretty simple. I saw the r/Doommetal's best albums of 2014, but I realized I really didn't dig anything that came out this year that much. I remember looking back at an indie thread that had the concept of best albums of this year recorded in any other year, but not quite what I'd like to go with. But yeah. Your favorites? I'll start.

#1: [DOPESMOKERRRRR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIw7oeZKpZc)
The heaviest thing in existence. Nothing else should ever be in this spot.
#2: Windhand's Soma. I can't find a full album on youtube, but check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE7aB95aTFE) out. Approximately half a Dopesmoker long, so I guess it's worthy of its own place.
#3: [Church of Misery's Thy Kingdom Scum](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeVcTgilDeCnCH922OaL0gO2zNpxVtBL1)
Japanese doom metal about serial killers. Can you get any more metal than that?
#4: [Pallbearer, Sorrow And Extinction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBJfHuyGpsI) 
No explanation needed.
#5: Electric Wizard's Come My Fanatics. 
Can't find a stream for this one either, but hey. Take a nice [Return Trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVGcRNotCAE)
#6: [Cough, Ritual Abuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ_aHEOerpY)
Cough reminds me of Electric Wizard but with a sort of tortured agony in the sound. Just dark, and heavy, and hopeless.
Yay for not having full albums on youtube. Maybe I should fix that. 
So, your picks?"
"Your top 5/6/42 doom albums of all time?","&gt;#1: [DOPESMOKERRRRR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIw7oeZKpZc)
&gt;The heaviest thing in existence. Nothing else should ever be in this spot.

I would argue that Master of Reality could be in that spot. Anyway, I may as well do my list. I'm too lazy to link, besides y'all should be familiar with most of my picks. I'm going to limit to one album per band to keep it from all being Black Sabbath.



~~10. Cult of Luna - Somewhere Along the Highway~~

~~It's not straight-up doom, but post/sludge is doom as far as I care.~~ 

~~9~~10. Electric Wizard - Dopethrone

~~8~~9. Slow - Unsleep

~~7~~8. Witchfinder General - Witchfinder General

~~6~~7. Pallbearer - Sorrow and Extinction

~~5~~6. Warning - Watching From a Distance

Edit:: 5. Thou - Heathen

How'd I forget this? I went into the list specifically thinking about this album.

4\. Uncle Acid &amp; the deadbeats - Mind Control

3\. Type O Negative - World Coming Down

Apparently not everyone agrees on them being doom. I consider them doom, so fuck off.

2\. Candlemass - Nightfall

1\. Black Sabbath - Master of Reality

Shout-Outs (not familiar enough):

Sleep

Solitude Aeturnus

Pentagram

Saint Vitus

Trouble

Cathedral

While Heaven Wept

More Shout-Outs (close contenders):

Pagan Altar

Funeral

End of Green

Teardown (not technically doom, but close enough for me)

Jack Frost

Bolt Thrower (only the IVth Crusade, though)

1. Dopethrone by Electric Wizard"
"Your top 5/6/42 doom albums of all time?","Yeah, I bought Soma on vinyl. I love the album, and I've heard it a hundred times. A YouTube link is a little more convenient for everyone than a bandcamp stream, though."

"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","I live in a condo and I can't turn my shit up because of neighbors, therefore that means no bass, no noise, no doom. So I need some headphones that will go so fucking loud that I will go buttfuck insane from the sheer amplitude of doom. So bottom line is, I need a FUCKLOAD of bass, and they have to be able to reach completely ludicrous volume without
a) exploding
b) melting
c) blowing or
d) getting all distorted and shit
 If someone could help it would be much appreciated.

EDIT: Ok guys, most of that was for comical exaggeration, but I'm still looking for some loud headphones, I know better than to go too crazy with it."
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","None. If you're listening with headphones you should do it at a safe volume. Don't damage your hearing and you'll enjoy music for years to come. And honestly, a good set of headphones can provide you with all the frequencies you want to hear at low volumes. When driven too loud the headphones won't produce everything clearly.

Source: I have hearing loss from playing &amp; listening to music. Sorry to sound like a parent but your hearing is worth protecting and if you lose it you don't get it back."
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","I'm half deaf in one ear and I blame ear buds. Please don't do it (seriously)....

Music sounds like shit when you're half deaf."
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","There are a few great headphones for doom metal in the price range. 

Grado makes some of the best headphones for rock/metal for the fast and tight bass response the [Grado SR80e ](http://www.amazon.com/Grado-Prestige-Series-SR80e-Headphones/dp/B00L1LXOWS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420685473&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=grado) would be a good choice for a more well rounded sound. However they can be bright and sound a bit cold however they are very fun headphones. Since they are open they also provide no sound isolation.

Superlux HD-681 EVO are another great pair in the price range. They come in two colors [black](http://www.amazon.com/Superlux-HD681EVO-B-HD-681-Black/dp/B00CAG1ZAQ/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420686139&amp;sr=8-2-fkmr0&amp;keywords=superlux+hd668b+evo) and [white](http://www.amazon.com/Superlux-HD-681-Professional-Monitoring-Headphones/dp/B00CAG1ZG0/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420686139&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=superlux+hd668b+evo) they have a nice warm sound with good bass and decent mids these are also fun for doom. They come with a nice set of accessories 2 detachable cables 2 sets of ear pads velour and leatherette and a bag. 

I own a pair of grados and wear the evos for about 8hrs a day at work. So I have experience with both sets. Depending on your choice in doom and other music would be the other types of music you listen to honestly. 
"
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","What's your top budget?"
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","$50 as of now but don't be afraid to post more expensive options as this is something I'd be willing to save money for, but god forbid please no more than $110"
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","I have the dj style headphones from monoprice that kick ass, pretty cheap too. But don't destroy your ears dude, I'm only 18 and I have to make everyone repeat themselves because I played my headphones too loud too much and I never wore protection at concerts"
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","I'm using RHA MA750s, they're amazing. If you dislike in-ears, check out the Audio Technica ATH-M50x.

If you're on that budget, get Soundmagic E-10s. Best bang for buck in that pricerange.

Edit: If you just want shitty bass cannons without any mids or treble just get cheap-ass Skullcandies or something"
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","Don't get anything that has a bass or treble booster. Recently just got a Stereo headphones by Sony, which is flat and I think it's worth it because it's fairly cheap. 

Also, blasting away at high volume is not safe at all. You will never enjoy the music when everything is pushed up. "
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","There's nothing less metal than not being able to enjoy metal."
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","if you want to crank it up loud and not have any distortion you gotta look at the quality of the audio file.  fyi. "
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","Iam thinking of getting the

""Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pro 80 Ohm"" 

Heard good things about them, go check out a review."
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","I use the Laredo headphones from the California Headphone Co for my day-to-day experiences. One of the best soundscapes I've heard in a $20 headphone. 

Also note this is $20 shipped from Amazon!"
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","I have [these Sony earbuds](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDREX10LP-BLK-In-Ear-Headphones/dp/B004XXQI1U/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420739978&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sony+earbuds), and I discovered a trick that may help.  They come with several sizes of rubbery ear buds, and I've noticed that the largest size really amplifies the sound, esp. the low end.  It also amplifies anything that touches the headphone cord (like my jacket zipper as it rubs against it while I'm walking) so I only use the oversize ones at home when I'm sitting still.

Also, what everyone else said, hearing loss is no joke, all those shows of my youth without earplugs are catching up to me."
"What are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?","I'm at CES and just got to try Alpines headphones. They have tactile drivers that actually shake the headphones for bass(as well as killer bass also). Currently only available at the Apple Store for $299."

"My cover of Earth's Tallahassee","Wow, for that it sounds really awesome. Yeah it was pretty clear that this is not a mic'd vintage tube amp. But since I had the impression that this was a pretty quick done cover and not a really elaborate production, I already expected this to be done digitally (and of course you can hear it). But that's why I had to ask because for what it is, the guitar sounds really cool. "

"Doom/punk songs like this?","Yep."
"Doom/punk songs like this?","There's [another Electric Wizard song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHvEgxRsUn4) on Let Us Prey that's got a strong hardcore bent, and obviously Satan's Satyrs and Alucarda, but can anyone point me to more outright doom punk?

I'm not after hardcore-influenced sludge or crust as there's quite a lot of obvious punk there, but rather rare stuff like this. I'd expect Satan's Satyrs take a lot of Electric Wizard influence anyway."
"Doom/punk songs like this?","Not *quite* what you're asking for, but when it comes to doom/punk type stuff, you may want to check out [Axegrinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZMwd_ODUY) and other, more crust punk (I know you said you're not looking for crust, but I think stuff like this is more doom/punk than hardcore) stuff like [Amebix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1KGWYId8vc)... especially if you want to hear the more filthy, punky side of doom.

EDIT: Also, perhaps [Brainoil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyF1LketUr8)?"
"Doom/punk songs like this?","I'm familiar with all three, but thanks for the suggestions.

Let me clarify: **I'm not after sludge**. I know my sludge quite well, but I'm not looking for heroin withdrawal gutter crust. 

What I'm after is anything along the lines of those two Electric Wizard songs and the [Satan's Satyrs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePputnIXlVc) and [Alucarda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp8eDO45QDg) I mentioned. Fast, fuzzy, old-school rock 'n' roll with a doom low end. Retro, tape-hiss stuff. Unless there's not a lot of it about? I can think of a lot of garage rock/punk that sounds exactly like this, but I was wondering if there was more of it in the doom canon.

EDIT: When my wife left me, these were my go-to, but I also listened to Yob all the time, mostly Catharsis...I'd say that is (mostly) what broke me out of the depths of misery.  Not to mention bands like Om, where I could just meditate on my thoughts and put them back together coherently.  My wife loved Opeth, so of course, I would avoid them, and listen to other stuff, like Old Silver Key, and Drudkh proper.  Solace in what you understand, in what many understand, the doom will always be there for you, in good times and in bad, this is the conduit to place you at the bottom of the pit, but also help you to the top.  May the greyest of days and the darkest of nights forever envelop you."

I had to hear more of those guys. I opened up Napster and searched pentagram and downloaded a few of their songs to listen to (I get that that's kind of fucked up but I was 13 at the time and file sharing was sort of new). After waiting hours upon hours my song was finished downloading, I eagerly clicked play, and to my surprise it was some band from the 70's with the same name that I just wasn't feeling at all.

Years later when I started getting into doom I decided to give this band a go one more time and became instantly hooked. Pentagram (USA!) kicks so much ass. This is one of my favorite songs by them as well as 20 Buck Spin (that solo!)

The Chilean Pentagram also kicks ass though."

"Just getting into Doom, but there's some I love and some I don't...Can anyone point me in the right direction?","I've loved metal for a long time, though I'd always been an old school thrash fan.  Over the summer, a friend took me to see [Iron Heel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2bsVw57bRA) and I was fucking blown away.  Since then I've been trying to find other doom I can get into, and while I've found lots that I like, it's not scratching my specific itch.  I like Crowbar, but they're too fast.  I like Sons of Otis but they're too psychedelic.  I like Electric Wizard, but they're not riffy enough.  I like Negative Reaction, but I think I like them because I love thrash and groove.  Other than Iron Heel, the only bands I've heard that really hit the spot are Pallbearer and Sleep.

So, I think the things I'm looking for are riffy, slow bands with clean vocals.  Anyone got any recommendations?"

GROOVY SLUDGE (There'll be dirty vocals, man up)

-[EYEHATEGOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf0_8xVik6o)

-[Acid Bath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aObw5l6xbq0) (mix of thrash and sludge with croony vox and 
screams)

-[Melvins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwSOrd4E7yw) (start with Houdini and Stoner Witch)

-[Dopethrone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVi2xU19jTA) (bluesy sludge, skip the first album)

-[Sourvein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjZYBkr73G0) (Southern riff gods, more prolific than the devil)

[This compilation](http://www.discogs.com/Various-Hes-No-Good-To-Me-Dead/release/905885) is really good for getting into sludge, [this one](http://www.discogs.com/Various-Welcome-To-MeteorCity/release/1556961) for desert and stoner rock and the two [Dark Passages compilations](http://www.discogs.com/Various-Dark-Passages/release/2373842) from Rise Above for more traditional doom.

[Warhorse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzOovR0S1uk), the band that upstaged Electric Wizard all throughout the Dopethrone tour. Might have something to do with Electric Wizard Mk. I being a [notoriously shitty live band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBF_RABLte8).

Cathedral were once upon a time the titans of the genre, now they don't exist. They used to be [sad and monolithic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVYE1kJY5oQ), then they went [retro and silly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XeKQ3qOlmg).

[Solstice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CVr7_VP16o) are as traditional as it gets, rooted in NWOBHM (Angel Witch, Pagan Altar) and 80s epic doom (Candlemass, Trouble, etcetera). 

Finally, [Acid King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVgMOtWkTj4). Low end destruction with a really distinctive singer. III is a really good album.

And as a bonus, do you know [Demonspeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yKTBRnY-yI)? Nothing doom about them, but they're a thrash band with swing influences. This means 90% of the time they sound more like Danzig than Exhorder, which is cool. Their singer was offered a place in Misfits, so the story goes.

And listen to everyone else because they know what they're on about.

Very overt, soaring keyboards feature prominently in the album, and really sculpt it's atmosphere into one which utterly, unapologetically evokes space; vast, beautiful and filled with wonder, but at the same time cold, uneasy, and perhaps as much filled with melancholy and sorrow as with joy.""*

"Best Yob Albums?","I love Atma and The Great Cessation, but I am curious what everyone else thinks and why?"
"Best Yob Albums?","All. Because Yob is love."
"Best Yob Albums?","Definitely check out Catharsis. Its one of their greatest older albums IMO. It may sound a bit different but its quite good. They made a remastered version not too long ago I think.

Some people think their newest one (Clearing the Path to Ascension) is their best one since Atma. I think its absolutely awesome and I've listened to it quite a lot recently.

The two I mentioned above as well as The Great Cessation are my absolute favorites.

Illusion of motion is pretty sweet too if you're looking for more. :P

I'm going to a YOB concert near me in March and I'm SO pumped :D Check their tour locations to see if they'll drop by where you live.

Sorry, I'd describe the albums but I'm too stoned so this took me forever to type out on my phone lol. You'll just have to check them out or read some reviews. Enjoy this awesome band :P"
"Best Yob Albums?","Yes catharsis is amazing. I have the re issue and the only diffence I can find is they made it louder. The original album you had to crank your plaer with the re issue you crank it and are in a doom heaven."
"Best Yob Albums?","&gt;Some people think their newest one (Clearing the Path to Ascension) is their best one since Atma. I think its absolutely awesome and I've listened to it quite a lot recently.

Because Clearing the Path is their only album since Atma, it is also technically their worst :-p

&gt;The two I mentioned above as well as The Great Cessation are my absolute favorites.

Great Cessation is my favorite also! Super dark, super evil, super heavy.

&gt;I'm going to a YOB concert near me in March and I'm SO pumped :D Check their tour locations to see if they'll drop by where you live.

Baltimore? 
"
"Best Yob Albums?","Oh you're right about Clearing the Path and Atma, for some reason I thought there was something in between... XD And I'm from Canada :P"
"Best Yob Albums?","They've pretty much been on an unstoppably good run since Catharsis, but if I had to rank their releases:

1. Clearing The Path To Ascend

2. Atma

3. The Unreal Never Lived

4. Catharsis

5. The Illusion Of Motion

6. The Great Cessation

7. Elaborations Of Carbon

I would definitely hit up Clearing and The Illusion Of Motion next, followed by The Unreal Never Lived (Quantum Mystic might be my favorite Yob opener). Also, they just dropped a remaster of Catharsis last year that sounds incredible...

"Weedeater killed it at Day of the Shred","Just a PSA to drink and listen to Weedeater. Dave Collins is the real deal"
"Weedeater killed it at Day of the Shred","Just got home and had a great time. Couldn't get there right at the start and Bongripper played earlier than I expected, but I caught at least half of the set and they sounded great. Went to their merch area and they were all out of shirts, but I did pick up an Elder shirt. Was told Bongripper will have more shirts up on their set in the next week or so. 

Elder played a good set and I'm pumped to hear they have a new album coming out soon. They sounded good overall, the live vocals were somewhat mixed but their tracks aren't too vocal heavy anyway. 

I only caught the last couple songs of Graves at Sea because they were playing at the same time as Elder. Only listened to them once or twice before but they really impressed me, I'll certainly be looking into them further. 

My second time seeing Windhand, they've just never really clicked with me, but the crowed seemed into it and the singer sounded better than the last time I saw them. 

Weedeater were a big surprise for me, I'd only heard a couple songs from them in the past and they didn't stick with me at the time, but their energy really won me over. The drummer was great to watch, I loved his kicking the cymbals. 

Red Fang had a solid set, I haven't seen them since their first album and they seem to have polished up their performing a bit, but have always been a fun band. No surprises, but good times and the crowed was into it. "
"Weedeater killed it at Day of the Shred","Nice. I showed up as Greenbeard was ending.  After seeing Goya tear it up I pretty much stayed at the Reaper stage.  Supposedly Arctic is pretty good and I'll give Graves at Sea a go as per your recommendation.  What blew me away was Radio Moscow, I need to check out their releases.  They're psychedelic but they do bring some kickass riffs. Highly recommended.

Bongripper was definitely a brutal sonic adventure and their sound was on point.  Ancestors had some killer psychedelic doomy keys that I was not aware of.   I'm pumped about Elder also, the new song has an awesome hook.  First time seeing Windhand and their tone is much more monstrous live than I was expecting.  Weedeater I think is the perfect blend of styles and they really brought that out live along with a hilarious and awesome stage presence. 10/10 would get drunk and break shit.

Unfortunately I had to bail before the Fang showed up but not before I grabbed that awesome 10 color silk screened poster.  All in all it was a legendary showing of bands from all over the states and hope that Thief continues to bring kickass tunes that we normally can't reach over here. 
"
"Weedeater killed it at Day of the Shred","There were some great sets at this show.  I was mainly interested in Bongripper and Weedeater and they didn't disappoint (except for  Weedeater's technical difficulties).  I've seen Weedeater before, so I expected them to be awesome.

I'd never been into Graves at Sea before, but their show was pretty damn good.  The guitarist from Bongripper was tearing it up in the pit.

I had hoped to catch Elder, but I think they were at the same time as Graves at Sea, so I missed them.

It was the best show I've seen around here for a while, hope they set up more of them in the future."

The large scultures to the sides of the stage could easily be a Sleep album cover. There was a fucking cloud of smoke before the show ever started. Unfortunately I only caught the last song of Kowloon. Hearing Dopesmoker live for the first time was a fucking experience. Literally sent shivers down my spine. I was halfway stoned from the cloud. I was sitting in the upper level looking down. They were so fucking loud the entire upper level was vibrating. I felt it in my seat. Hands down the best show I've ever been to. 10/10.

"A Sleep wallpaper I blew some time making today","Yeah, and I'm sure the shows are all better for it.

 I doubt I'd ever get to see any doom get played locally - with any big doom bands being near impossible -since I couldn't imagine the doom scene being substantial around where I live. Not to mention the fact that bands typically don't go out of their way to play where I live."

Sadly, the rest of Pentagram's albums aren't really worth listening to. But those three albums make up for it."

"Pentagram- All Your Sins","I may be a bit biased here but the rest is worth listening to. Not really Show 'em How, that's probably the weakest. But the others definitely have their hits and still hold up, if not AS good. I think the one problem is they went through so many musical changes 70's 80's and 90's that they were hard to pin down, but every album has its own merit, from the hard rocking 70's to the demented sub basement.

"Just getting into doom, really digging it so far. Have any suggestions?","I've been giving Electric Wizards discography a good playthrough and I am loving it. I've tried listening to sunn o))) before but couldn't really fit into it. In looking for stuff that is; slow,  heavy and crushing (so basically doom metal). I've read the required listening thread and I'm going to start their when I can get to it all. What got me into wanting to get into slow and heavy music is a new band(not doom per say,  more sludgy prog death)  called alkaloid, pretty good. I've also been a fan of crowbar for a while and of course sabbath my whole life pretty much. Sorry for the rant. 

Tl;Dr new to doom and looking for some tasty and doomy riffs. "
"Just getting into doom, really digging it so far. Have any suggestions?","[Tumbleweed Dealer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8K8KVxFVqo), instrumental stoner/doom. Not as crushing, but if doom met the old west.

[Beast in the Field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTW0gpC16DE) heavy instrumental shit.

[Conan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-of5C1OHX_8), of course

[Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSpsffboOAc), great occult/hammer horror rock. Re-live the lo-fi '60's.

[Orchid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvtAMFhbuRA), Black Sabbath of the 2010's. Seriously.

[Windhand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7Nf7_Z9dPU&amp;list=PLfW2AYRb0ykzGdOouPnCONlQr7Fc0SR7C), fantastically heavy, female fronted doom.

[Bell Witch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KebMq2AIVM&amp;list=PLYscXtOSkiBnFMFljSaa-fa42h1xafVvj), bleak, desolate, soul crushing, slow and heavy.

[Monolord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCc901E02eY), great new doom. Very heavy with distant, watery vocals. Empress Rising is an excellent record.

[Slomatics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iem9uIBaOCg), awesome doom from Belfast. Estron is the ""Warp Riders"" of doom, imho.

Edit: Forgot about [Coltsblood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XogeWSGxgGw). Similar in heaviness to Conan. Their first full length that came out last year created a rift in space."

Bongripper - Amazing instrumental doom band. Get Satan Worshipping Doom, probably my favourite album ever.

Bongzilla - Thick stoner doom riffs.

Church of Misery - Japanese doom, obsessed with serial killers

Conan - The heaviest band in the world. Get everything, including the split with Bongripper.

Dopethrone - The band, not the album

Goya - Electriz Wizard worship

Grey Widow - Heavy, blackened sludge. Very good.

Holly Hunt - Big booming riffs

Monolord - Swedish fuzz doom

Sea Bastard - Sludge/Black Metal/Doom

Sleep - The original stoner band. Get Dopesmoker

Slomatics - Inspired Conan, similar vein. Get the new album Estron.

Windhand - Stoner doom"

You can also delve deep into the discography of My Dying Bride. I absolutely love them and they've been my favourite band for 6-7 years now. 

Esoteric is also a good band, their music makes me physically ill and exhausted, I don't know why, but they just have that effect on me (not a bad thing).

This isn't quite the Robert Johnson by way of Crowbar I was hoping for, but it works really well. Proof that when we run out of Sabbath riffs to steal we should go raid the annals of black music. "
"Dopethrone - Ain't No Sunshine [Bill Withers cover!]","Cracking song live - very underrated band as well
