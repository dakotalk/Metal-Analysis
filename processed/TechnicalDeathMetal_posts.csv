"Ulcerate - Confronting Entropy (New Song)","*Niiiiiice.*  It's similar in a lot of ways to *The Destroyers of All*, but it doesn't just feel like it could be ""just another Ulcerate song"" like many of the tracks on that album - the riffing feels more distinctive and intricate, like they were really trying to bring the styles of *TDoA* and *Everything is Fire* together.  That can only be a good thing for me, since my main issue with *TDoA* is that it lacks distinctive tracks (compounded by, and followed by, the rarely changing tempo), whereas every song on *EiF* had its own unique structure, use of scales (when not playing in full-on chromatic mode, anyway), signature riffs, etc.

So yeah, I'm fucking excited."

"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?",""
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","There was an article on /r/metal a while back that was from Metal Injection or something similar interviewing the ex-drummer from Rings of Saturn. Basically he said that that Lucas recorded everything at half speed, for a fact, on the first album, then doubled the speed and protooled the living shit out of it. He talked about having a hell of a time trying to play it full speed live, while Lucas usually played the guitar track from an ipod and turned his live guitar way down and basically faked it most of the time. He also said that Lucas planned the second album at half speed, played by himself, even though they had brought on a new guitarist that could play all of it at full speed. So basically Lucas is a cheating asshole.

EDIT: Here's the article.

http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/11/06/more-rings-of-saturn-drama-ex-drummer-brent-silletto-shares-his-side-of-the-story/"
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","Oh yeah, I'm aware of the history behind this guy. I can't believe he still shows his face in public, let alone ask for 20k to record his shitty half-speed tracked music."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","I mean, the guy has talent, he's just lost all his credibility in anything by cheating to go farther than he really can. Which makes him an asshole. A talented asshole, but still."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","Unfortunately so. As a guitar player, I wouldn't mind if his hands were crushed in some horrible half-speed recording session accident."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","&gt;He also said that Lucas planned the second album at half speed, played by himself, even though they had brought on a new guitarist that could play all of it at full speed.

Well the fact is that the second album, according to the producer Robert Velasquez Swanson, was not tracked in half-time even if the first was tracked at half-speed.

[Here's](http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/11/05/the-drama-continues-rings-of-saturn-guitarist-refutes-accusation-that-band-recorded-album-at-half-speed-accuser-fires-back/) the following article with the culmination of this, including the producers' post. 

So say what you will about his kickstarter campaign but I'm not sure it's fair to criticism him for unproven allegations of a former band member who had been out of the band for a couple of years."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","True. To the ex-drummer's credit, he did say that he couldn't be positive that the second was recorded half speed, because he wasn't there. He just said that he was pretty sure because that's what Lucas' intentions were, and what he'd done before. "
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","Actually I was mistaken - Swanson was the studio engineer for both albums (not producer only on Dingir). Also the other side of this, Mann's perspective is:

&gt;[He couldn’t play our material at all in the studio, and by the time we toured, he could barely get through the songs live. It’s amazing how he is trying to flip this story back on us when it is really about him.](http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/11/08/even-more-rings-of-saturn-drama-band-responds-to-ex-drummers-accusations/)

I've also read, I think, a facebook post detailing this a bit more with Lucas stating that the recording budget for the first album was almost completely drained by the drumming sessions since the drummer couldn't play. Can't for the life of me find it at the moment, but nonetheless I'm not really sold on the ex-drummer's criticisms since we've seen these guys play the Embryonic Anomaly at full speed live."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","I saw them live when they were touring with The Faceless, and *every* song started and ended with Mann running to his Mac laptop behind some amps, and I heard absolutely no action noises from his playing. Way too clean and seemingly not on time, just like this video."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","Maybe. I haven't seen them live. I think it might be a little bit of both, in a way. The drummer did admit that he could barely play the material. And with the criticism, it doesn't make a ton of sense that Lucas wouldn't put up playthroughs. He did one for Invasion later on, garage quality, and some of the solos and stuff. I don't know. They both could have reason to be trying to trash the other side."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","No need to worry, I highly doubt he's going to get more than $2200 before his campaign runs out. I wouldn't really mind if he came out and said ""ya, I cant play this live"" or if he didn't make videos of his playthroughs on an obvious MIDI track, but seriously, thats crossing a line. 
"
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","when you think about how [Hannes Grossmann only needs ~5500$](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-radial-covenant-solo-album) for his solo album, which will probably be &gt;9000 times as good...."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","It's clearly MIDI guitar programming. People like this are the reason society doesn't work. There's a link in the bottom right hand sidebar saying ""Do you think this campaign contains prohibited content?
Let us know."" for anyone who cares enough to report this unscrupulous campaign. 
"
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","Is it just my phone being weird or were his fingers clearly not doing the same thing as the audio track? If so, yeah, that's just embarrassing and lame."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","I see the same thing when watching. He's playing along what sounds like a well-sampled midi track exported from guitar pro, and I'm pretty damn sure he plays some parts at half speed and then speeds the video up to full speed. Especially at 1:27."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","That's without a doubt him miming along to Guitar Pro playback.  I can't confirm that anything's sped up in the vid, but I thought that while watching as well.  I just don't understand how he thought it would be an awesome idea, after all the previous shitstirring, to make this video and think that it WOULDN'T raise more doubts about his abilities.  Or maybe he thought that no one would notice?  WTF..."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","What a prick.  If you can't play full speed then don't fake it.  Play something you're comfortable playing and make it awesome.  Dick"
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","[He ended up getting $1,060 HAHAHA](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lucas-mann-solo-album)

I honestly thought he was going to get 10k thanks to these aliencore swagfags but I guess not"
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","Why can't any artists today earn their own money?  I find this a little weird since he is begging for money, and on the internet none the less.

I'm glad he was found out and proved he was cheating as /u/IsolatedWolf said.  

This is somewhat off topic kinda... But I noticed most people on those Indigogo, Kickstarter, Gimmie your damn money because I don't want to use my own websites are sometimes scamming people out of their hard earned change by not giving them what they were promised or money back because the goal wasn't reached. 
 



Edit:  Who the FUCK needs 20k to record an album?   Am I missing somthing or reading the page wrong?  Feel free to correct me."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","Apparently he needs/wants 20k, but I've seen artists do it for far less (like [Krimh](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/explore), asking around 6.5k). Unless he's getting top of the line *everything* he shouldn't need even half of 20k."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","He's supposedly hoping to be getting the best of the best recording, mixing, mastering, and studio drummer tracking and an extremely expensive flight and trip to this top-of-the-line studio."
"This hack is trying to swindle people out of 20k. Am I the only one getting an off vibe from this vid?","Knew it was Mann before I even opened the link. The whole situation is unfortunate. Sure, record your stuff at half speed to get the desired tight effect. But don't straight up lie about it and make a ""play along"" video where you mime to a Guitar Pro track. 

You know, now that I think about it, this is all rather reminiscent of the whole Al Mu'min issue. "

"Hannes Grossmann - The Radial Covenant","This is awesome but also pretty similar to Obscura, maybe too much... Obscura is one of my favorite band so I enjoyed this release but that could totally be their new album. The compositions are good, but I expected something different from him."
"Hannes Grossmann - The Radial Covenant","he did write some of the songs on Cosmogenesis.  The one after that they started collaborating as a unit more.  You can't blame a guy for writing the way he writes. :)"
"Hannes Grossmann - The Radial Covenant","I know he composed for Obscura, but I was wondering why he didn't write these songs for a new Obscura release instead of making a solo project which is really similar...
Anyway, this is just my opinion, and his music is still awesome ;)"
"Hannes Grossmann - The Radial Covenant","I read in an interview that they deliberately approached the composition of Omnivium's songs collaboratively rather than individual members submitting finished compositions.  Grossmann said that these were his individual compositions, some of which were originally intended for Obscura prior to the decision to write as group effort.  But yeah....you are *totally* right on the similarity.  Might as well be an unofficial album."
"Hannes Grossmann - The Radial Covenant","Ok, thanks for the precision, that explains why it sounds so similar :)"

"Can I just say...","I unsubbed from /r/Metal because it seemed the only bands that were appreciated there were the bands everyone already knew about and liked. An extremely stagnant subreddit. I stay subbed here because sometimes someone posts a legitimately interesting band. But I have to admit, I sometimes question why some people post the bands they do here. There are a lot of posts that are just not technical deathmetal. I'm not meaning to whine, and certainly not trying to declare certain bands as not ""real"" as others, but it is a little frustrating. I want new tech death. Give me the next Necrophagist (as they're surely not going to fill their own shoes anymore) or Anata!"

It continuously baffles me why people get so butthurt when bands are pointed out to not be metal. Usually these are the same people that deride notions of genres at all. If it's 'just a label', why do you care so much?"
"Can I just say...","I can say that Progmetal is probably the coolest subreddit for metal in general.

"Can I just say...","/r/progmetal is almost entirely made up of stealth metalcore acts, and people who whine when someone says that they can't stand the metalcore elements.  Sure, prog metal is about pushing genre boundaries, but I still find metalcore annoying as hell."
"Can I just say...","Metalcore is annoying. But the folks in /r/progmetal think the same thing.
There are probably 5-10% metalcore bands in progmetal and even if they are metalcore, they are progressive in some sense. And I can guarantee, none of them are stealth metalcore acts. The ones that are metalcore know that they are metalcore ."
"Can I just say...","Mainly because it's kind of hard see how deathcore *isn't* metal regardless of how bad it may be."
"Can I just say...","I'm an uber elitist.  I whine about what bands are real. Deathcore gets posted everyday, and you all just let it happen.

So what now, huh? :)"

That can be a good thing and I definitely think it's good that they got a real drummer now.  That said, I just think the songwriting and their style of music have changed for the worse.  It's less original and less interesting to me, but I'm only judging on the one song so I may end up really liking the album as a whole"

It just had me wondering, and I'm really hoping these two bands don't wait ten years between releases and basically ignore fans like Necrophaggits.

"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis",""
"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","Just curious what you guys think about this topic.  I find too many tech death albums suffer from over compression and would love some recommendations of more ""real"" sounding music in this genre.  Personally, I loved many aspects of this album; the technical prowess of the band, the driving riffs and layers upon layers of experimentation... but I feel it sounds too muddy when listened to with a good set of speakers and the instrumentation sounds almost blended together and lost within post production.  I first listened to the mp3/web releases and thought I would hold off for a good lossless flac, only to be disappointed that the flac sounded no better than the mp3/web release.  Where can I find truly *good* *sounding* technical death metal?"
"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","Do you like Obscura?

Edit: I though the album was OK, definitely liked their first two releases more though.. I think the guy in the video nailed it."
"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","Yes, I really like Obscura... but their sound suffers in much the same way.  Although it is not half as noticeable as the Fallujah records, Obscura really could sound better (check my earlier response to u/goldenvile).   I'm just sad that such an awesome band (Fallujah) had their hard work ruined by shoddy production and hope there will be a re-release of this that is more listenable."
"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","Hmm I think they sound really nice. Do you have any examples of music that sounds like what you're looking for? (metal or not)"
"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","Sure... please check this video for a more detailed overview of what I am talking about here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qz7ZjJS9U8

Examples of good production in this genera (mostly nothing modern that I can find) - 

Necrophagist / Epitaph

Death / Human (pretty much everything prior to The Sound of Perseverance
 
/u/meshugganner pointed out Gorguts... I'm finding this is a good answer to my original query.   Production seems spot on and I'm going to have to revisit their catalog.  Thanks!



"
"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","You think Necrophagist sounds *less* compressed than Obscura? "
"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","Absolutely... but don't take it from me.  [Check the waveforms yourself.](https://imgur.com/WaDvjjd) Maybe you don't really notice because everything these days is so compressed and washed out.  Get a truly good set of speakers (not Beats by Dre ;) and take a listen to some of the examples posted here.  It's about the sound quality of the instruments coming through... not the songs themselves.   I really do love this music, but now that I have a good system at home I really get to hear how much of the production is soured by the 'loudness war'. "
"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","I've been thinking about getting some Audio Technicas for a while now.."
"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","Those are really good... this [comparative review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et_PWifUd1w) was pretty funny.  I'm a big Klipsch fan myself.  Their desktop speaker offerings suffered from some over-heating problems and so they were discontinued (all but the 2.1 system)... but the sound was hands down the best available.  So when my old 4.1's died (after over a decade of use) I searched around and finally found a set of Klipsch 5.1 Ultras on eBay and decided to risk it... even if they are 'used', for $200 I am one incredibly happy listener."
"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","I agree with you, but wouldn't say it's not ""good sounding"" as the writing and technical ability is amazing. I think what you're looking for is ""well produced"". 

I'm a big fan of the production on the new Black Crown Initiate. One of the few tech death albums I've heard recently with a great bass tone as well. "
"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","Absolutely correct, I should have said ""well produced"".  I love this style of music but think in general that the production is lacking on most records here and Fallujah's production is a perfect example to illustrate what I mean.  If you check the dynamic range of this album, it is around 2-3 for most tracks!  The new Beyond Creation album is around 5-6... noticeably better sounding but go back a few years and listen to Necrophagist where the Dynamic Range stays right around the 8 mark and you should be able to hear how the production sounds better on this 10 year old album than most of what is released today.   Now take that and compare to a different style of music like the latest Daft Punk album which at the lowest is 9 and up to 13-15(!) on average and you can literally feel difference in clarity of the instruments on the record.  My stereo has a volume knob... I don't need the producer to drown out all the feeling just so the music seems louder than other bands. 

Thank you for the recommendation!  I haven't listened to Black Crown Initiate yet... will be sure to check them out.   Any idea where I can get a lossless copy?  Seems the CD bundle is sold out and the new album isn't on their bandcamp site.

"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","I think Beyond Creation might be better for you. Also Ulcerate, as someone else said.

"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","Despite everything I've said here... I want to be clear, Beyond Creation is one of my favorite bands right now.  I really do love this music! However... I know the music would have more punch if it weren't produced for ""normal"" people to listen to on their iPods."
"Fallujah Dynamic Range Analysis","I 100% agree. Most of the new tech bands, or really metal in general, I find it hard to get into because it just SOUNDS flat or lifeless. Even though I know how complex or talented the band is. The sound just kills it. "

I actually have Colored Sands but didn't think about it last night when I created this post.  This album isn't half as brick-walled as other albums... sound is great, The Battle of Chamdo was totally unexpected, and just listen to the clarity and punch in those drums!  Looking up their older stuff and giving them a second listen :)

EDIT: Well... maybe I need to find this on vinyl?  I checked out the Gorguts-Obscura album and the [CD release is pretty bad](http://dr.loudness-war.info/album/list?artist=gorguts).  Check out the [waveform of the second track](https://i.imgur.com/6VXxlHg.png)  (all tracks are similar) and look at all the red lined sections.  It's as if it was cranked to the max on the CD release.  Their latest album thankfully does not seem to suffer from this.

EDIT 2: You're probably, maybe (?),  right about this. Trust me, bad production (as in just bad, or as in *too* good) bugs the hell out of me. If there is clipping, etc. in Obscura, I swear it only adds to the disgusting, ugly, putrid sound that that record is trying to convey. I don't know - I just love that god damned album."

"FLESHGOD APOCALYPSE - ""Minotaur (The Wrath of Poseidon)""","[deleted]"
"FLESHGOD APOCALYPSE - ""Minotaur (The Wrath of Poseidon)""","I apologize for being such a prick about it, I was really drunk last night.

To me, Fleshgod was a wonderful band because they basically played classical music in techdeath form. Any song you listen to on Oracles, you'll hear the same cadences/trills/progressions that you would on Agony, except in the case of Oracles, *there is no symphony*. It's all done with the instruments of the band. I have never heard another album as classical in nature yet so pure fucking techdeath as Oracles.

With Agony, this all goes out the window. They stop playing death metal in the style of classical music. They play some generic riffs that you can't even hear, mindless blast beats that syncopate at the same place in half the songs, and all of this is being drowned out by the awful symphonic elements. It's about as unoriginal as it gets. The album wouldn't change if you just took out the guitar and bass altogether. They no longer play classical music in death metal form, they play shitty death metal smothered in copy and pasted orchestral sequences. Fuck that.

Last, it's no longer techdeath! Listen to At the Guillotine, or In Honor of Reason, then listen to The Egoism... The fuck? This album seems to be the same. They try so goddamn hard to sound epic, but it just ends up being extremely boring. It doesn't sound so bad at first, but then you realize that the rest of the song is the exact same, and the rest of the album will be that way as well... "
"FLESHGOD APOCALYPSE - ""Minotaur (The Wrath of Poseidon)""","I hear where you're coming from since Agony and Oracles are completely different beasts and I far prefer Oracles if I'm to be honest. but to say their newer work is totally unoriginal is a pretty left field response IMO. The only other band that utilizes symphonic elements like this is Septic Flesh (that I can think of off hand) and FG does it with a much greater emphasis on tech. I assume, (although never researched to be certain) that they compose all the symphonic parts in their songs so it's not simply some cut and paste nonsense.   
  
I'd like to see a heavier influence on the guitars playing melodies again and like you said, it's hard to pick out exactly what the guitars are playing because they now seem to simply augment the melody with rhythm instead of conduct it. I also agree with you that they're sacrificing the heavy tech they used to brandish and now strive for 'epicness' or whatever.   
   
Still, I have high hopes for Labyrinth. It's natural for a band's sound to evolve, it's just too bad when our expectations don't coincide.  

EDIT: after listening to the track a few more times I like it more than I did. There are guitar parts throughout the song that drill 32 notes into your face, drilling rhythmic intensity (very remeniscent of some Septic Flesh tunes). But there are also really fast paced melodic runs that burst almost from nowhere and dissipate just as quickly. Band members said this album would be a culmination of the new and old sound. The symphonic will stay but perhaps some components of Oracles and Mafia will be reasserted stronger than their last effort.    
Those classical yet brutal riffs we crave surface occasionally but are much more reserved and controlled than on Oracles. They bob their head up just long enough for us to notice their presence and then disappear again. I can see based on the praise the band has given the CD along with the tracks I've listened to already, the goal is to create something masterful, novel,  driven by the essence of metal but mixed, now entwined with melodic, symphonic elements.    
   
God damn it, I hope I love it.    

To really judge the quality of riffs in said music I recommend everyone take a few listens.   
   
 And better yet, get some descent headphones and an amp to go with them if need be. If you happen to be listening to your tunes through your motherboard audio input then your opinion never really mattered, head to /r/headphones  for a start and head-fi.org to start grasping how much more money you need to spend on audio equipment.

"WTF Necrophagist!","It's been a damn decade now Muhammed, are we going to ever get new material or can you just come out and call it a day already! 

/endrant

Thoughts?"
"WTF Necrophagist!","Patience young grasshoppa "
"WTF Necrophagist!","That would have been reasonable to say in 2009 as well..."
"WTF Necrophagist!","I've made two similar posts, myself."
"WTF Necrophagist!","If you want it to be anything like previous Necrophagist then listen to their live play of dawn and demise from the new album. If it is ever released, I don't think it will be disappointing. Muhammed is a perfectionist, he knows what the standard is. I truly cannot wait for this album."
"WTF Necrophagist!","as much as it pains me to say this: I would rather wait and have it be perfect than out sooner and be OK"
"WTF Necrophagist!","My concern is that when they finally do release new material it will have been so long that expectations are too high and the new stuff can't meet it. Look at Wintersun for example, first album was awsome, tons of energy and great leads, it felt new and fresh. Fast forward 12 years, the second album was stuck in production hell and by the time it was released most people had forgot they were even a thing and worst yet- It wasn't a great album. The longer a band makes us wait the more we expect. Its unfair but it happens."
"WTF Necrophagist!","This isn't a universal rule, though. Colored Sands was awesome."
"WTF Necrophagist!","and Surgical Steel!"
"WTF Necrophagist!","In addition we should keep in mind that if Necrophagist releases an album, their style might be totally different since it has been 10 years since the last release. "
"WTF Necrophagist!","omfg what if their new shit is djent"
"WTF Necrophagist!","I've talked to Muhammad on many occasions. I seriously doubt that'll ever happen lol."
"WTF Necrophagist!","I feel like it's either going to be one of the best albums of the genre or a huge disappointment. The hype surrounding it for the past years have made it so there can be no in between."
"WTF Necrophagist!","I've gotta disagree in Time not being a great album."
"WTF Necrophagist!","Some people loved it, I just wasn't a fan. Personal preference I suppose."
"WTF Necrophagist!","Just an ""fyi"", the way I understood it was this: Time I is a group of the more experimental songs he wrote after the self-titled debut.  Time II will be more akin to what fans of the first album want."
"WTF Necrophagist!","I have also heard that was the idea. I will be ecstatic if that is the case."
"WTF Necrophagist!","Amen"
"WTF Necrophagist!","At least the drummer [stated](http://www.metalinjection.net/finally/actual-update-new-necrophagist-album) on his [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/romain.goulon.9/posts/10201958509753588) that Necrophagist is not dead.
But then again I understand that it is taking far too long. "
"WTF Necrophagist!","IIRC Muhammed said a while ago he was going back to studying which is why I thought it was taking so long in the first place. It doesn't however, explain why there has been no update whatsoever."
"WTF Necrophagist!","Well people are still interested obviously, so there isn't much of a need right? Nobody is owed anything. "
"WTF Necrophagist!","As someone who supports them by purchasing merchandise and buying albums, I'd like an update. If I was just going to download the album and only listen to the music, then I agree, I am not owed anything."
"WTF Necrophagist!","Buying merch does not make you a VIP.."
"WTF Necrophagist!","Being treated like a VIP and posting a quick update on a website are 2 completely different things genius."
"WTF Necrophagist!","I know it seems like its not going to happen, but it took Gorguts 12 years from their last album to release Colored Sands. ""So you're telling me there's a chance?"". Maybe, just maybe."
"WTF Necrophagist!","I don't give a fuck honestly.  
When people hear tech-death, they often rant about how it only shows off technicality and skill. Necrophagist are a perfect example for this in my opinion.  
They may be the spearhead in technicality, but they lack a lot of substance for me.  
I love Spawn of Possession, Beyond Creation, Gorguts, Soreption, The Faceless, Archspire, Artifial Brain and whatnot, because they are all entirely different, have all some progressive elements, they all have their completely individual appeal, whether it's cool lyrics, amazing grooves, crazy concepts, brainmelting riffs and solos or beautiful melodies.

But with Necrophagist, what it comes down to, is pure technicality imo.  I'm not saying I won't be incredibly stoked if they put out another release. How could I not be?  
But honestly, i don't care much"
"WTF Necrophagist!","It's coming. Sooner than you think."

"Nile - The Burning Pits of the Duat",""
"Nile - The Burning Pits of the Duat","I fucking love this track. Quote from Karl Sanders:

""The Burning Pits of the Duat"" features further collaboration with Dallas. I worked on the lyrics and Dallas set the to music. Dallas really felt that the lyrics and title unquestionably called for utter underworld socery - riffs so fast, chopping and iniquitous as to muscally capture the sensation of being consumed in pits of fire.

So Dallas went to work, and the infernal riffing he conjured was so overwhelming in its brutality and hellish in its technicality that for the rest of us to play the material correctly required weeks of intense rehearsal; not only to play the riffs clean and in time (and to legitimately nail the tricky changes), but for the drums to maintain the overwhelming 256 BPM blasting, constant quick beat changing and crazy fills.

This was the impossible song at Nile rehearsals - not only challenging but excruciatingly painful. I would return home every night with my wrist in so much pain that I begun to wonder if the song would end my career. After weeks of work, when we finally got the song rehearsed to the point of being able to consistently nail it, I breathed a thankful sigh of relief. I was reminded of the time when John McEntree (Incantation guitarist) toured with Immolation, and spent the whole tour with his wrists in agony, wearing wrist braces, because he was unaccustomed to the strain of using completely differing groups of wrist muscles neded to play Bob Vigny's unusual riffing style. Dallas had ""Vigny'ized"" me. The song is undeniably deliciously malevolent, yet fun to play, even if it fucking hurts like a bitch."""
"Nile - The Burning Pits of the Duat","Dude, awesome back story!"
"Nile - The Burning Pits of the Duat","Right? I love that back story because it illustrates how much time, effort, dedication, and musicianship goes into creating the most brutal shit in existence.

Something about pushing your body to its limits just so you can nail that riff is amazing to me."
"Nile - The Burning Pits of the Duat","It's such an awesome song and I don't think people realize just *how fast* it actually is. The double picking on that main riff is absolute hell too, one of the few Nile songs I really wanted to learn on guitar and just gave up on. I drummed for a tech death band for a while too and like to think I'm relatively proficient but that damn split- kick blast is impossible. IMPOSSIBLE."

MP3s of Joyless Parson have been floating around for years, but they just recently had it professionally mastered and finally gave it an official release. The vocals are a lot more prominent on the original, which I prefer, but both versions are worth listening to.

If you are interested, Orgone's guitarist/lyricist/vocalist has been active in some alternative rock side projects that share a lot in common with Orgone, both musically and lyrically. Here are some bandcamp links:

[Miracle Worker](http://miracleworkerus.bandcamp.com) - Quirky, mutant alternative rock. Catchy, yet gross. I think only an extreme metal musician could come up with alternative rock like this. It's like Weezer meets Orgone.


[Meadow](http://meadowus.bandcamp.com) - Sort of shoegazey. I posted this to /r/shoegaze and it got downvoted to oblivion though, LOL. I think the sour bent notes (and somewhat out of tune singing?) turned people there off."

From Sumerian Record's facebook:

Evan Brewer checked in to address his absence from The Faceless during their current tour with Between The Buried And Me

 ""I'm sure many of you have become aware of the fact that I have not been out with The Faceless on their current tour. I've been using this time to explore a potential musical opportunity that has presented itself. Initially we didn't feel the need to say anything because we thought it was only going to be a couple of shows missed but, due to the circumstances, it became apparent that it would be better for them to finish the tour without me. I am not looking to quit the band, merely exploring an opportunity and I hope to be back on tour with The Faceless again in the near future. We will fill you all in on details regarding future tours as soon as they develop. Please go support The Faceless on the rest of this fantastic tour and I will catch up with you all down the road."" - Evan Brewer"

"YOU MUST LISTEN TO THIS!! ex. faceless member and necrophagist member and produced by the awesome Par Oloffson","This is fucking sick. This is honestly a prime example of how I like my tech-death, from vocal stylings to mixing/mastering.

I really hate when tech death is so over-produced that the finished product makes the guitars sound almost synthy, like the sounds were programmed for a video game or something.

And the drums in this track! They sound like fucking drums! So many modern tech death albums mix the drums to sound like mouse clicks or something. 

It doesn't sound like robots made it, I guess is what I'm trying to say. I may even venture so far as to call this melodic tech-death.

"YOU MUST LISTEN TO THIS!! ex. faceless member and necrophagist member and produced by the awesome Par Oloffson","I think this album is definitely going to be a ""guitarist's"" album. Just from the way the guitars are mixed, both in tone and volume, and the fact there are what sounds like 5 guitar tracks in some parts, and that noodly fuckin solo-intermission thing. I'm so stoked. 

Maybe I'm biased because I play guitar, but I also love how the vocals aren't forced on the listener, if that makes sense. A lot of engineers will beef up the vocals such that you can't help but notice them, but it's nice and subtle here. Fuckin bueno."

"Brain Drill - Parasites","My issue with this band is that they're absolutely oozing with talent but they never do anything with it.  Their songs never feel like actual songs.  It's just like  ""hey look how good we can play"".  Maybe it's just me."
"Brain Drill - Parasites","What about this song in particular? Do you feel the same way? "
"Brain Drill - Parasites","Yup"
"Brain Drill - Parasites","I mostly agree.  I like the band, but their songs oddly fall short and just aren't memorable.  They lack something -- though I don't know what specifically -- that could finally give them the bump they need to be great.  For now they're just lingering on the cusp."

"Spawn Of Possession - Deus Avertat","That album fucking slays."
"Spawn Of Possession - Deus Avertat","Seriously it's incredible. Chaotic as all fuck."
"Spawn Of Possession - Deus Avertat","I go in phases with this album. I absolutely love every second of it, but I can't help but criticize the weird guitar tone. It doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of the music, but it is like, why the fuck didn't they add some resonance to that guitar?? its so crunchless."
"Spawn Of Possession - Deus Avertat","I think the guitar tone on all of the spawn of possession releases has more to do with clarity. There is a lot going on in a tonal sense that could easily be muddied by an inappropriate tone. I'm sure it could be better but it is what it is. "
"Spawn Of Possession - Deus Avertat","Yeah, I see that point, but the tone is really lacking in the muted notes. Compared to the regularly strummed notes in the melodies, the muted ones seem to be really quiet. 

That's basically what I sum it up to. They wanted every note to be super intelligible, but ended up with too little gain, and too much gating, or something. Still, I go nuts over every other riff. It's a jaw dropping album. Sometimes, I'll be sitting in my car and a solo will start, and I almost have to pull over and try to reevaluate my life."

This sounds like it could have been another track on ""The Aura"", which is still totally fucking awesome because that album was incredible, but I really like when I can discern song styles from one album to another. I'm still fucking stoked as hell, and going to buy the album for sure, but just saying."
"BEYOND CREATION – ELUSIVE REVERENCE [NEW SONG!]","Agreed. It's a great track, but I actually thought it was a remixed track off Aura at first. Anyway, it's only one song and I know when my band was writing, the first couple songs we wrote for a new album sounded more like the previous album.

Really looking forward to this still though."
"BEYOND CREATION – ELUSIVE REVERENCE [NEW SONG!]","If you listen to the live recordings of ""Earthborn Evolution"" it's slower and more melodic than anything on The Aura."
"BEYOND CREATION – ELUSIVE REVERENCE [NEW SONG!]","My sentiment exactly. The mixing and style seems almost identical, but it's also very likely that they would tease a track that's similar to their old ones just let their fans know that they can still still deliver. "

Unsurprising, since The Faceless loses members so often that it might literally be faceless. I really liked both members (and their projects outside the faceless!) and I'm sad to see them go, but I'm even more excited to see what they'll work on next. Thoughts?"

"Evan Brewer AND Alex Rudinger quit the Faceless","I get the vibe that Keene is the one in control and may not allow as much input as other members want?  Sad to see them go, but that just means more new music from two talented musicians. "
"Evan Brewer AND Alex Rudinger quit the Faceless","[deleted]"
"Evan Brewer AND Alex Rudinger quit the Faceless","That's because Keene is a control freak and thinks way to high of himself. Seeing them live and watching him treat techs like shit because his rig was fucking up was extremely disheartening."

Who likes it?
Who hates it?
Favorite songs?"
"New Fleshgod Apocalypse","I just picked up the album and I've listened to it once all the way through. First impression: I was a bit disappointed. It is in the same vein as The Agony though I feel that this album is less memorable. It's like they took a step back in their songwriting and melodies and just blast away. It all kind of ran together after a while. Maybe the subtleties of this album will present themselves with more listens but I felt rather unimpressed at first. And the solos blow."
"New Fleshgod Apocalypse","This about sums up my feelings as well. It lacks flow and melody; seems a bit unpolished in the writing."
"New Fleshgod Apocalypse","I felt like that at first. Give it a few more listens and then make up your mind. There is a lot going on musically and the guitar riffs can sound a bit bogged down and difficult to hear. I'd recommend listening with a quality pair of headphones for an improved experience. "
"New Fleshgod Apocalypse","Upon first listen, I was kind of unimpressed, Minotaur and Elegy were the only tracks that stuck out to me. But after several repeated listening sessions, I have started to pick up more of what's going on. This was the case with Agony as well. There is a lot going on at one time and I don't believe listening to this release just once or twice is giving it a fair chance. The riffs are actually fucking stellar. I'm really stoked about this album and I think from a musical perspective this is their best release. I do however still love the style of Oracles and Mafia as well. This is definitely an improvement over Agony. "
"New Fleshgod Apocalypse","I didn't know, I'll check it out."
"New Fleshgod Apocalypse","Production is my only big complaint."
"New Fleshgod Apocalypse","I really wanted to like it, but with the exception of a couple catchy tracks, this album will remain in the shadows of much more interesting metal released this year."
"New Fleshgod Apocalypse","I started it at work the other day and it just didn't grab me enough to get all the way through. Very technically proficient, but I didn't feel like it was anything new and just became very blah half way through."
"New Fleshgod Apocalypse","Album has a different feel than Agony which felt more insular - feel like it was due to the album concept and the use of Paolo's high cleans. Labyrinth feels more operatic and epic - I chalk this up to the increased use of Veronica Bordacchini's soprano and a bit to the widened production.

If you liked Agony you're more likely to like Labyrinth. Finding ""Fall of Asterion"" one of those repeat-type songs - the right-side bell hits at 2:00 are addicting."
"New Fleshgod Apocalypse","Love it. Minotaur and Fall of Asterion are my favorites"
"New Fleshgod Apocalypse","[deleted]"
"New Fleshgod Apocalypse","I really like it. I think it sounds like what Agony was suppose to sound like, but they just hadn't hit the mark yet. Although I highly doubt that any of their albums will ever be as good as Oracles or Mafia. Still, much better than Agony in my book."
"New Fleshgod Apocalypse","I don't think I can pick a favorite track but Minotaur's intro is crushing and the verse riffs in Elegy are excellent as well. Towards the sun and warpledge are also quickly becoming favorites. The solos have always been kind of meh for me as well. They are very well executed but also really simple. But I think part of the reason the solos are so simple is to offset how intense the rest of the music is. "

edit: If this helps any, here is [some info](https://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Ron+Sword) on front man Ron Sword. I am not a musician myself, but from what I understand... he is a technical musician. That is not to say this qualifies his band as Technical Death Metal.

There is a very entrancing guitar sound/riff on that album that becomes almost a theme on the album. You can hear it very well at this point in Wings Of Predation.

"ANOMALOUS - The Seraphim Veil","I actually ran into [Nate](http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Nate_Vennarucci/24997) at a show in SF a few months after this album came out. I asked, ""Where's [Max](http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Max_Seeman/53876)?"" to which he responded, ""That's a good question.  No one really knows.""  The resulting conversation led me to believe that Anomalous was Max's studio only hobby band, and that they would likely never play shows.  Nate has since left, [Marco](http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Marco_Pitruzzella/38512) left the bay area IIRC, and they haven't released anything since.  At best, we can hope for another album, but I wouldn't hold my breath for a tour."

I notice a lot of people are neg on the vocals, but I think they are work really well with the this bands tone. I can't imagine high/mid vocals sound sounding any good on this album at all.

"Another new JFAC track, this one is called The Celestial Antidote","Every fucking album that has came out this year sounds better than the last, and I'm like, ""album of the year"":  Fallujah, Archspire, Inanimate Existence, Abysmal Dawn, Beyond Creation, but I think this is gonna be my actual favorite album of the year judging by the three songs they've released so far. FUCK. 2014 is the year of Tech Death."
"Another new JFAC track, this one is called The Celestial Antidote","Haha that's exactly how I feel. This one came out of left field though. I've always liked JFAC but just as a by the books tech death band that I wouldn't skip if it came on. These three songs have totally changed that though."
"Another new JFAC track, this one is called The Celestial Antidote","Absolutely.  Their other stuff has always been a lot of hit-and-miss to me, but goddamn, these new songs are incredible."

"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","Call me crazy, but I like the production on this album..."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","Same here. I feel like a lot of his points are valid criticisms but at the same time they are so minor I feel like they hardly detract. I'm not sure if a different style of production would suit their compositional style. When you have this many layers at the speed they play at things need to be sharpened a bit."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","I'm pretty neutral to the production on this album, but I've heard only praise for it (besides this review of course). To me it doesn't come off as robotic or overly-synthetic at all. Bands like Archspire and Necrophagist do though."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","I personally love the sound of bands like Archspire. The Lucid Collective is one of my favorite albums this year."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","Production sounds like plastic to me, the guitar could use some buzz."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","I try not to care too much about production. The only time production gets in the way of me loving music is when it sounds like a Death record or when the mastering is so loud there is popping all over the record.

EDIT: I personally think Archspire's album sounds exactly the way it needs to sound."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","&gt; sounds like a Death record

What the fuck is wrong with Death's production?"
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","I can't listen to it. It just sounds like its being played through a coffee can in an echoey room to me. I can't concentrate on the music at all and just focus on how it sounds. I always try to listen to Death every few months trying to see if I dig it but end up getting about 5 minutes into the album and switching to something else. This bums me out every time."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","Which album(s) in particular are you talking about? 
"
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","I can't currently recall the album name but its one of the most renowned ones. Its mainly red. It also has a re-mastered version that was released."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","The Sound Of Perseverance? That album has the best guitar tone I've ever heard."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","Yes, that album. My ears don't agree."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","Maybe you might enjoy the remastered versions of Human and Individual Thought Patterns by Death. The drums and bass are a lot higher in the mix and the guitar tone is cleaned up a bit so it sounds a bit less ""buzzy"" if you get what I mean."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","I am neutral to this production as well, but the biggest pont I think he made was in regard to the compression. It does sound smushed or contained to me. Much of the album is really trying to soar and spread out melodically and with the riffs and it just comes off to me as though its in a shrunk wrap an only pushing against it, not breaking through sonically. Overall I really enjoy the album and think its one of the best of the year!"
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","Someone on /r/progmetal explained it as being mixed in a way that sounded as if everything was coming at you from one direction, which I do kind of agree with. I felt it could have been more stereophonic with more spatial separation between instruments."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","Not a very surprising review. Fantano ALWAYS complains about any technical metal sounding to clean or robotic and he always has a complaint about the production. "
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","I personally feel like if this album didn't sound as 'clean' as it does, then a lot of the intricacies of the instrumentation may have been lost.. I would say a lot of the most acclaimed tech death albums have the same 'robotic' precision sound because without it this type of music can easily descend into something that just does not sound good.

Lets be honest too, for every one good tech death band, there has to be *at least* a dozen that just totally fail to resonate, IMHO. It's an easy genre to miss the mark in."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","Soreption and Fallujah both released records this year to similar complaints. Both in my mind are some of the most technical bands running at the moment."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","I can see Soreption being a little overproduced in the drum tone but that's it."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","Was he reviewing the album or the production? The music itself was no more than a passing thought to him."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","It's all a part of the package they delivered."
"The Needle Drop reviews Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails","Ughh... a 4. That was painful."

God that song was so much heavier than anything I had ever heard.  Give me goosebumps still.  Ironically was listening to stuff off of Spiritual Healing when I saw this pop up on my front page.

"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","Which should I listen to in depth first and which one do you prefer?
I'm really not into the metalcore vocals, do both bands use them?"
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","The Aura by Beyond Creation is probably my favorite techdeath album out there. it's amazing."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I love how it's so technically proficient, yet still has those slow-tempo, sometimes easy riffs that sound that like the earth is being torn in half. Beyond creation has mastered the techdeath breakdown too."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","Yeah totally agree. That frettless bass though. So pretty sounding"
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","Oh my god. It's so tasty. Also, everyone should check out [Son of Aurelius](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfS4I2-Srok)"
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I think I'm gonna go with Aura first, I'll definitely check more of The Faceless though"
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","Just listen to Planetary Duality and Alkedeama. Autotheism is a bit...too different to listen to first. I prefer Beyond Creation more though. "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","Autoatheism was so bad.  I'm sorry but faceless was doing so well and suddenly it just went to shit "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","NOOOOOOOO. Autotheism was their best. "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","The Faceless obviously have three times as many albums put out and the funny thing is, that each one has a completely different style. The first album is sci-fi deathcore and is actually one my favorite deathcore albums out there. their second album deserted all the -core and went straight up tech-death, which again got us one of the best albums of it's kind, also very sci-fi themed.  
then they made their third album which turned a bit away from the tech and got way proggier and it's probably my favorite album of them. it isn't really that sci-fi anymore either, but actually very atheistic. I am no atheist anymore, but I still like the bashing of christianity in the lyrical sense.  

beyond creation on the other hand have a tech/prog style with noodly fretless bass and some really amazing riffs. *the aura* and *the departure* are among my favorite songs of all time and the fact that I don't have never bought anything from the faceless, although listening them for years, but having bought *the aura* on cd after listening to the album about three times speaks for itself.  

**the faceless** offer more albums and way more diversity across their discography, but beyond creation are(imo) better. also their bass player (dominic forest lapointe) is my favorite bass player in the whole wide world"
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","They're both incredible. The Aura and Autotheism are both 10/10 albums IMO."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","Listen to the first two albums by The Faceless. They are amazing. Beyond Creation is also amazing so give them a lot of time as well. 

Autotheism by The Faceless sort of loses me. His singing is painful. The heavy / shreddy parts are awesome, but there's just too much wrong with the album to like it as a whole. I like parts of it. 

Just my opinion on it. "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I like Autotheism a lot, but I do prefer their older stuff. The first three tracks on Autotheism are really strong and the song Ten Billion Years is great too."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","My favorite is Hymn of Sanity. The album isn't bad as a whole, I just don't like the singing parts much. I don't hate all singing, I'm just not a fan of his. I have plenty of music with singing I like. "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","Oh definitely, I know they were trying to go out of their comfort zone with the clean vocals and various other things, which I appreciate but I agree his clean vocals aren't the best ever."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","They're two unique styles, honestly. The Faceless has a bigger catalogue right now, so you could probably spend a good bit of time immersing yourself in them. Beyond Creation, though still very technical as well, sticks to traditional metal a little bit more just in the scales they use."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","Why not both?"
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","It depends. The faceless have changed their style on all three albums. I personally prefer the faceless, but you should listen to both in depth for sure. If you like your metal to be more progressive, listen to the autotheist movement. You should check out polarity and diminishing between worlds by decrepit birth as well."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","THE FACELESS. Listen to Akeldama all the way through first.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KudwhIozknE"
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","Don't listen to Autotheism. Listen to Akeldama."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I would say listen to Akeldama and Planetary Duality *first*, but I really like Autotheism and would suggest listening to it (with an open mind) as well. It doesn't sound like them, they changed up their sound and experimented a little, but it is still a good album."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","If you want to listen to Autotheism I recommend reading the lyrics along with each song. The lyrics are quite good and definitely helped me appreciate the album a lot more than I originally had."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE AUTOTHEISM? Keene has amazing cleans. Autotheism was my favorite album from them. The Autotheist movements were just breath-taking. It was a masterpeice. 

But I haven't listened to Beyond Creation, so at this point, The Faceless. I'll check them out though. "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","Seriously haha people that don't like autotheism just want the band to keep doing the same thing and never progress I guess. I got to see it live and from then on developed a huge appreciation for it, its progressive as fuck."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I know the large majority of people who don't like it is their ""core"" fan base who don't listen to anything but core. "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","For real dude. But Beyond Creation is also incredibly sick, definitely give them a listen.
"
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","Will do. "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I really like the clean vocals, but other than that I don't find the songs very captivating compared to their other albums"
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I haven't listened to Autotheism a whole lot, but it just seemed less technical than the previous Faceless records. I dig Autotheism, but not as much as Akeldama or Planetary Duality."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","To be honest, I was never a huge fan of Akeldama. I loved Planetary Duality, it's what got me into The Faceless. But Autotheism amazed me. Keene's vocals, his shreddage on the guitar, but it still had those ground-shaking vocals. And Lyle's Jazz-fusion style drumming. It was a great and solid album. I loved it. "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I've listened to a lot more Faceless than Beyond Creation, but I think the Faceless has a much more unique sound to them.  Michael Keene has all those really cool dissonant sounds and extended chords that I really like.  Beyond Creation is solid though.  I'm probably one of the few people who actually like the clean singing on Autotheism. "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I love the clean singing, as well as the entire theme of the album. Now I'm an autotheist."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","There are some really cringey lyrics like entire Hail Science song, but I still really like the album.  I think that Planetary Duality is my favorite though."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","Better than any Christian metalcore song.
"
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","DAE LE SETAN LOL XDD"
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I don't care what the religious orientation is.  If its good music its good music.  I am not a Christian, but I love Extol.  They have some absolutely amazing riffs.  Hail Science reminds me of something I'd see on /r/cringepics."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","You aren't the only one who loves Michael Keene's beautiful vocals. "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","The Faceless. Autotheism is great I don't know why everyone's being such a critic. 

Planetary Duality is also really good... pretty much just the Faceless."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I never get tired of listening to The Faceless' first two albums. There is so much to every song on every listen. I would highly recommend them. I have never listened to Beyond Creation, but I will be in a few seconds. "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","neither use metalcore type yelling, both bands are great. I think I prefer Beyond Creation but both bands are worth your time. In regards to the Faceless, start with Planetary Duality or Akeldeama. Their new album is more progressive. I saw Beyond Creation live in montreal a few years ago and they were phenomenal."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I'd have to say The Faceless, only cause i haven't gotten into Beyond Creation yet. Can anyone recommend some songs i should check out?"
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","They only have one album, so I'd say to just listen to the album. [Listen here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U16hXRMqJw)"

"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","If you like The Faceless, check out Dysmorphic next. "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","Planetary Duality is such higher quality than The Aura in my opinion. It's so highly detailed and deliberate, with a really solid atmosphere that I feel Beyond Creation just doesn't really acheive. Autotheism was pretty disappointing, being that it was just ""the Michael Keene Show"". The lineup during PD is what made it so strong. "
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I don't know if many other people do this but I give a band 30 seconds (60 if they do long intros)


If they don't hook me in 30 seconds I move on and never look back.

That seems like a great way to miss out on a lot of good stuff."
"The Faceless or Beyond Creation?","I dig that but I really only care for a specific thing, when it doesn't get the hair on the back of my neck to stand up it isn't doing it for me."

But I've actively commented on this sub since there was ~200 subscribers, and I can tell you that when we hit 1000 deathcore actually became a problem here. So much so that tickdickler changed the sidebar. But he doesn't actively mod this place (and I sure as hell don't want to) so instead I ridicule. It rustles my jimmies, in a good way.

Ninjaedit: Oh, you're part of the problem. Please relocate yourself to /r/deathcore."
"Fallujah - ""Venom Upon the Blade""","Pretty sure the song we're commenting on never tops 160 bpm and most of that is half-timed chugging. A jazzy interlude and some fancy guitar work does not technical death metal make.

But w/e, I'll agree that they're borderline, like the Faceless, or Sons of Aurelius, and I actually like the latter of those two and would probably upvote that so who am I to downvote this? More ridiculous than labeling them deathcore is calling them underrated, however. I'll stand by my ridicule of that statement--this sub loves it some Fallujah."
"Fallujah - ""Venom Upon the Blade""","Not going over 160 bpm and half-timed chugging does not make it deathcore, either. I would say those characteristics are more prevalent in conventional death metal than deathcore. What makes Fallujah rise above the rest is that what makes them technical isn't the death metal parts so much as the ambient and melodic passages. Developing an atmosphere around intricate guitar work, then counter-balancing with progressive death metal riffing really stand out over most new death metal bands."
"Fallujah - ""Venom Upon the Blade""","&gt;half-timed chugging does not make it deathcore

wat"
"Fallujah - ""Venom Upon the Blade""","Death metal has been using half-timed chugging riffs since Cannibal Corpse. Obviously in a much different feel and context than Deathcore bands, which is exactly my point. Nothing from Harvest Wombs or Nomadic would suggest anything but a small core influence. "

"Fallujah - ""Venom Upon the Blade""","Sometimes people just want to be contrary for the sake of being contrary. I'll never understand why people feel the need to argue about genre classification, haha. If the good denizens of /r/technicaldeathmetal don't think it's technical death metal, then they're going to downvote it. That's that."

"Fallujah - ""Venom Upon the Blade""","I don't listen to deathcore at all. This song is very tech deathy..."

I would like to clarify some information about the fact that Dominic will no longer be part of the band. We know that Dominic’s contribution to Beyond Creation was a big inspiration for many of you and we can definitely say that he is an incredible bass player with a lot of skills and groove. But for some personal reasons, there was a decision to take and this does not mean that Beyond Creation stops with it.
I have composed all the music and lyrics on both albums and a big part of the arrangements but each musician wrote their own arrangements and solos to put their feels on it. I also manage the business and the booking for the band and I have the chance to work and play with Kevin and Philippe that are incredibly talented musicians. I’ve started the band with high ambitions and dreams, and none of that has or will change…. This is only the beginning of a long career for Beyond Creation.
We are all looking at the same goals and we will definitely continue to play, tour and record music for a long time.
Do not worry, we will make sure to have a new bassist able to play and compose high quality arrangements , just like Dom has for our 2 current albums.
Dominic still our good friend and we know he will continue to shred the bass with his other bands and future projects.
We have big tours announcement coming soon and a lot of good things on the way so thanks to all of you for your support and we hope to see you on the road."""

"Ghost In The Machine - Paul Wardingham (In-Studio) [5:14]","as a guitar player i can appreciate this. hes undoubtedly skilled. that said, the music just seems like a bland background for him to showcase his lead skills. kind of like Jeff Loomis with slightly less teeth. hes good for sure but the music is kinda generic and overproduced. still upvoted cause i love excellent guitar players. not my ideal technical death metal music though."

Basically, these guys are taking everything from tech death and making it into something completely different.  At least that is the way I look at it."
"New Black Crown Initiate tune!","I'm halfway through their ep, its alright, very very talented, but when it comes to this type of metal, for me, when a dude is trying to sing, its an automatic turn off for me, there is also a certain drum beat that I despise that they use often. To each his own I guess."

"Job for a Cowboy - ""Sun of Nihility"" (NEW song for new album 'Sun Eater' on 11/11/14)","I've always felt their strongest songs were slower and more groove oriented like ""Tarnished Gluttony"" and ""Ruination."" I hope this means they're going to write into their best strengths this time. Not that I didn't enjoy their Demonocracy release, but I always felt they were selling themselves short by just writing one groove song per album."

"Job for a Cowboy - ""Sun of Nihility"" (NEW song for new album 'Sun Eater' on 11/11/14)","They have only had one death core EP. Genesis, their first full length, is straight death metal. Ruination is more technical. Gloom EP is more technical still. Demonocracy is more technical and progressive. This follows their progression. The addition of the Cephalic Carnage bassist on the Gloom EP and Demonocracy is what sticks out most to me."

"Mauricio Gallon plays Mindly Rotten ""Death's Fatal Flow""","That shit is insane.

Never heard of the band before but I just listened to 'The Most Exquisite Agonies'. Interesting album, but definitely not a daily driver for me."
"Mauricio Gallon plays Mindly Rotten ""Death's Fatal Flow""","Mindly Rotten is my favorite band out of the Colombian brutal death scene. I've seen them compared to other Colombian outfits like Internal Suffering and Carnal, as well as Desecravity (Japan), but they seem pretty unique to me.

The Most Exquisite Agonies was their debut and gained them some internet notoriety for being an example of the totally over-the-top brutal deathmetal coming out of Colombia. However, it's really chaotic and sloppy, to say the least. Moreover, the songs are less distinct than later releases and tend to run into each other. It took me a while to appreciate and I don't even try to justify my reasons for liking it to others, LOL. I recommend checking out their latest two albums.

Here are some links to YouTube and Grooveshark for anyone interested:

Their debut album: [The Most Exiquisite Agonies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwy-T14ygrc&amp;list=PLbvfJhfOuZc0KZ3ihcs-IB7vs5GJd-2Rh&amp;index=1) (2005)


Their second album [Proliferation of Disaster](http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Proliferation+Of+Disaster/7758008) (2011) was my introduction to Mindly Rotten. I became an instant fan of theirs upon encountering the videos for [Outside Forces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx_b1I8DgMk) and [Primordial Absence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt4y47KbWVY). Totally insane!


The new album [Effacing the Origin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWbcuU9ydt0) (2013) has the tightest playing, catchiest songwriting, and cleanest production of all three releases. It's catchy, but still really weird. Very different from their debut."

Just listened to them both. Their newest album is definitely WAY tighter and groovy, I could see myself listening to it again. "

"Synesis Absorption - Forever Untouched (Joe Haley + Mike Smith now!)","I'm trying to work out just what sort of effect it is.  It sounds like a flanger at some parts, a phaser at others, but it also sounds kind of like a low/high-pass filter or ring modulator when it gets that ""water drops in a cave"" sound to it.  It'd be a cool effect to experiment with, anyway."

The reason this subreddit exists is because of the people who are more into the technical aspect don't want to be bothered by scrolling through numerous submissions of bland 'cookie cutter' music to find the bands that are unique and progressing the genre to a new level. I for one, don't subscribe to /r/deathmetal, because I find this subreddit to be more along the lines of what I am in to and I am sure I'm not the only one.

Just a lot of pull offs. The only truly tough parts are anything having to do with endurance like some of the tremelo picked riffs.

In all fairness though, most of these songs have been unofficially tabbed out for a while.

(ob)servant and initiate are some of the coolest songs to jam out to. Especially the chorus in 'Initiate'. Opened my mind to so many more harmonics!"

"Guitars and bass","I've always been interested in bands that use their number of strings efficiently. How many strings do you guys use. And bass fretless or no. And if your jams are sick link em!!!!!"
"Guitars and bass","This isn't really a musician sub, and I don't play techdeath anyway. I'm not fast enough :( haha

But to sorta answer your question, I only use six strings. Have a seven string, but it's currently dead."
"Guitars and bass","I'm not the guitar player, but my guitar player and I both use seven-strings! Bass is a six string, not fretless, but I like to think it's definitely being used right!

[Anakronis, Calgary, AB](http://youtu.be/_JpVdaMnwts)"
"Guitars and bass","6 string currently, but im more into playing Mastodon and just listening to tech death anyways"
"Guitars and bass","I agree that this is more of just a fan sub, but I am a musician who tries to play tech death. Currently playing 6 and 7 string guitars. I generally favor 6 string in general, as the extra string(s) on 7+ string guitars kinda force you to slow down(due to how easy it is for the lower tones to lose distinction when played rapidly), and the lower tones generally invoke a very 'core' feel to them, which I dislike. I usually tune in range of dropped C, D standard, and dropped D. I seem to favor dropped tunings for the ease of big chord usage, allowing more complex voicings."
"Guitars and bass","Like everyone else has said: this is a place for posting music and discussion, mostly, and not a place for musicians. You might want to make a post in /r/metalguitar or /r/metalmusicians asking about tech-death players.

I do play the guitar, but unfortunately, I'm not good enough to play tech death yet. I can barely keep up with Amon Amarth's ""War of the Gods"" (what I'm learning right now), let alone play along to my favorite tech death bands.

As per my guitar: I play a six string, and don't own or play the bass."
"Guitars and bass","I mostly play 6 string. In my DM band, we use 6 strings and tune to drop C. I used to play a baritone for this, but it got smashed on New Years. Long story. 
I also have a 7 string that I've done a bit of writing on, but I prefer a smaller neck. On the other hand, soloing is better on the 7 because there's more options and everything is laid out nicer. Can't win. Here's my band. Check if out and let me know what you think! www.facebook.com/HTIorDie"

I've listened to this album twice now, and I can feel a consistent theme throughout, which is slightly lacking in my other favorite (The Lucid Collective by Archspire). Walking the line between theme with a mesh of songs that don't stand out and an album with great songs that don't fit together is extremely difficult, but they may have pulled it off. This album is very strong and certainly in contention for my favorite album of the year. "

"Katalepsy-Autopsychosis (Full Album)","beast album, it has it all."
"Beyond Creation","Listening to "" The Aura "" definitely brings back a sort of nostalgia for me and every time I listen to it, one thing comes to my mind. Is Beyond Creation one of those bands that we'll just never find again? I'm no novice to death metal but through all of my years, I've yet to find a band that utilizes the Bass Guitar like Beyond Creation does. I'm basically asking for one opinion and a few suggestions . Is Beyond Creation a definite one of a kind band ? And is there a band that uses the Bass Guitar like they do ( Just very prominent throughout their album . ) ?"
"Beyond Creation","Beyond Creation are definitely unique, but they aren't the only bands out there with bass guitar being prominent in the mix. Augury and Obscura (the first two bands that come to mind when I think of that tone) both use fretless six-strings (well, to be fair, the bassist for Augury is also the bassist for Beyond Creation). Definitely recommend checking out Augury for a similar but less aggressive vibe (Fragmentary Evidence was amazing, wish they would release another album). 

I don't think Augury is a one-of-a-kind band though. I thought the same thing when Demilich's Nespithe came out, and I've heard Demilich worship bands and other similar bands since then. Anyway, I'm rambling, but Augury and Obscura are good options (oh, and the last Quo Vadis album had a somewhat prominent fretless tone, although it's less brutal than Beyond Creation by quite a bit."
"Beyond Creation","I should have mentioned that Obscura is another favorite of mine to spare you . But holy beautiful bass guitar, Augury. Thanks for that suggestion. The fact that they're not as aggressive as Beyond Creation is actually quite fitting here. I don't know how these guys avoided my attention for such a long time. Thanks again. "
"Beyond Creation","Yeah, I remember listening to Augury after getting turned onto Quo Vadis six or seven years ago. Fragmentary Evidence came out and they were around for one of the only times they've come to the East Coast, and my jaw dropped. They sounded good on the album, but they just blew me away live. Sadly this was right before Forest left the band (he rejoined later), but they had I believe Christian who was a session bassist for MAG (an offshoot of the Augury guitarist). Great show, and I've loved them ever since. There's a good chance any of Forest's other bands would interest you, since his music that he plays tends to be very distinct."
"Beyond Creation","I didn't even check to just see what other bands Forest played for and I feel pretty stupid for not doing so . I must say though , this guy is pretty talented in my opinion . Thanks for turning me on to more of his work because I'm not looking forward to overplaying The Aura like I've done to Gorod's "" A Perfect Absolution ""."
"Beyond Creation","Also check out the radial covenant! It's a crowdfunded album by obscura's drummer Hannes Grossman. It also has obscura's bassist and a lot more really talented musicians. "
"Beyond Creation","No problem, bud. A Perfect Absolution was sweet, but I prefer Neurotripsicks. I liked all their albums, especially the latest two, but Neurotripsicks is just so catchy for me and I love the tone. Leading Vision is also good, and Process is the album that exposed me to them, but I hate the production on Process. Definitely like how the production doesn't sound so sterile on APA and the Transcendence EP."
"Beyond Creation","Gorod's just one of those bands that has yet to disappoint me , through any of their work . Same goes for Obscura . As you said , the production on APA was just gritty enough to be perfect or at least nearly perfect . The only thing I haven't been able to cope with is the ending of their songs . When you're in the middle of head banging to those catchy riffs and then all of a sudden the next song comes on but your head is still thinking about the last . "
"Beyond Creation","I definitely hear that. Some of their riffs are just so crazy good but don't last long enough / end easily."
"Beyond Creation","As people have already mentioned, Augury, Obscura, Quo Vadis, and Teramobil are perfect recommendations."
"Beyond Creation","Try [Augury](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DPW9ED1WBs) (less techy and more proggy) or [teramobil](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDhjvNo68sg)(full on technical death metal here, holy shit) if you don't mind instrumental stuff.

"Beyond Creation","Necrophagist - Epitaph"
"Beyond Creation","Great album in the history of technical death metal but it's in no way similar to Beyond Creation. The only prominent bass I remember coming out of Necrophagist was on the track Only Ash Remains . "
"Beyond Creation","? Then you didn't listen very well."
"Beyond Creation","Give the albums The Aura and Cosmogenesis a listen and then refer back to Necrophagist. The Bass Guitars are very different . Suiçmez is the attention of Necrophagist . Great music but the bass just doesn't match that of Beyond Creation . The sweeping and the riffs on that album are legendary but the fretless bass being played on these albums so very different to my ears . I may be a little off, however. It's been a whole since I heard that album , with all of the good stuff being released lately and Necrophagist remaining dormant . You know what I mean? If you haven't listened to all of "" The Aura "" you should do it though. And Obscura's entire discography. These guys take it to another level when it comes to making riffs and focusing on the bass. "" Choir of Spirits "" shows Obscura's talents very well if you want a direct song to listen to . ( Sorry for no links. I'm on my phone. )"
"Beyond Creation","I've listened to it all bud."
"Beyond Creation","oh, I forgot to mention though, you are right that the bass is much more prominent in Beyond Creation and Obscura. when I said ""you didn't listen very well"" I was only referring to your comment that Only Ash Remains is the only song in which you can find prominent bass. Stabwound has some amazing bass work that comes about a few times as the song repeats over that part again, for instance."
"Beyond Creation","Ah . It was a misunderstanding , I see. I forgot about the bass in Stabwound but Only Ash Remains is what comes to mind with that leading riff that's so freakishly catchy . "

"The Faceless...bad news","Funny thing is their influences are not really from the Faceless. They get influence directly from Deeds of Flesh, Soreption, Aeon. "
"The Faceless...bad news","Yeah , there's a section in one of the zenith passage songs where they straight up use a deeds riff / drum Part. It just sounds unoriginal to me. Not trying to hate but fallujah is on the same label and way better , as are gorod and arkaik. "

"The Faceless...bad news","Completely different in musical approach and a failure to deliver in my opinion. "
"The Faceless...bad news","Have you heard Veil of Maya - ID? I'm not a VOM fan, but that album is top notch. I put it close to on par with Planetary Duality, and coincidentally it was produced by Keene."
"The Faceless...bad news","I have heard it- own it too, I think. They never really cut it for me. The scales they us and whatnot don't really do much for me."
"The Faceless...bad news","Weak. Happy ill be seeing them again with btbam just in case. BUT- the faceless is just another name for what the real band's name is: the michael keene show. He'll find new people to further his own ego im sure.

I really hope he does, because I &lt;3 the faceless"
"The Faceless...bad news","Do people have proof of Keene being an egotistical control freak besides somebody having a bad experience with him here and there? I talked with him for about 20 minutes and he seemed really down to earth, humorous and easy going.

I know if I were on tour all the time, I might be a tad moody at times but that never showed when I talked to him.

I loved Autotheism. Fuck the haters. So some metal sounds like other metal? Go figure."

"The Faceless...bad news","This is definitely not true"
"The Faceless...bad news","glad they arent breaking up. love the faceless. maybe next album they will get rid of the singing and get back to the brutality"
"The Faceless...bad news","Honestly I could care less after their last album. Also, I saw them back in the day and was very underwhelmed by their live performance. The musicianship was technically brilliant, but they had zero stage presence or energy, just stood there playing and looking bored. It was a packed house too, I was pretty dissapointed. Born of Osiris and Arsis were much better. "
"The Faceless...bad news","I think it's for the best if it happens. It'd be cool to see Keene go solo imo."
"The Faceless...bad news","Last album sucked so....don't really care.

"The Faceless...bad news","I should think it is pretty obvious, really.

""do you like this band? would you like to see them live? Well, they are potentially breaking up soon, after which *you will not be able to see them live*, so if you want to go, dont wait."""
"The Faceless...bad news","I think the point that xmaspackage is making is that, if a band is about to break up, especially due to tension within the band (as has been suggested in this thread due to Keene apparently being something of a control freak), the live show has a reasonable chance of not being very good because being annoyed with band mates tends to hinder live performances, in my experience.

I still see your point, but I think that xmaspackage's point (as interpreted by me, at least) is valid as well, albeit not spelled out fully."
"The Faceless...bad news","I saw them a few months ago on the Dillinger tour and they sucked. It looked like nobody wanted to be on stage. It was so depressing."
"The Faceless...bad news","I came here to say this, i had the exact same experience. Ive seen the faceless a bunch of times and am obsessed with most if their music, but seeing them recently with within the ruins and rings of saturn was a bust. The only one that looked like he was remotely into it was Alex."
"The Faceless...bad news","I'm sorry to hear that; I hope you at least got to see some other bands put on a great show!"

But damn if it isn't fun to listen to!"
"Rings of Saturn - Faces Imploding","&gt; the first album (and likely the second) were recorded at half speed and pro-tools'd to hell.

There's zero actual evidence they recorded at half-speed on either albums and the producer on Dingir (at least) stated himself that it wasn't recorded at 1/2."
"Rings of Saturn - Faces Imploding","That's last I heard. The drummer detailed everything about the first album. Dunno how reliable it all is though, but I rather thought it made sense."
"Rings of Saturn - Faces Imploding","Even if they recorded at half speed, it would be for the sake of production quality. They have no problem playing the material live."

"[Q] Where should I begin from?","hello all /r/technicaldeathmetal fellas,
recently I have listened ""Epitaph"" of Necrophagist.I want to go deeper on TechDeath.Which bands should I listen first,or stick to the Necrophagist
 for a while?My metal knowledge isnt that great like some of you guys.so sorry for mistakes!
I dont know if you can count these as TechDeath;""Origin-Quo Vadis-Nile"" are the first 3 bands I ve listened as TechDeath."
"[Q] Where should I begin from?","Psycroptic - Scepter of the ANcients"
"[Q] Where should I begin from?","thank you!"
"[Q] Where should I begin from?","Once you're done with Scepter,which is one my favorite death metal albums, I would definitely give Psycroptic's other albums a go. [(Ob)Servant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow_3hXxf8p4) though. is a technical beast.

"[Q] Where should I begin from?","rings of Saturn's Dingir album and (unique leader records) has the best artist in tech-death imo on one label so check out that website, have fun exploring, I remember when I started listening to the genre, could not get enough, and still searching..."
"[Q] Where should I begin from?","Come on man. Read the sidebar first, listen to all those albums, then arrange by top posts all time. You really should automatically be doing that before asking where do I start. "
"[Q] Where should I begin from?","yeah, you are right."
"[Q] Where should I begin from?","Which band out of those 3 did you prefer?"
"[Q] Where should I begin from?","I liked Origin and Necrophagist.
I felt like Nile had some interrupting things in their music I dont know why .But when they play,it sounds amazing.I have listened the album sth like ""Those Gods whom Detest"" from Nile.
I have listened Origin's Antithesis and Entity albums.They sound amazing too!
And finally Quo Vadis.I liked this guys but they have been soooo brutal for me.So I think I will keep them for later."
"[Q] Where should I begin from?","I can tell you that Quo Vadis is the less brutal out of all of them, as for your answer:

 Maybe try 

-Spawn of Possession (the latest album would be good for you I think)

-Decrepit Birth (anything after ...And Time Begins)  

-Gorod (anything works, though I personally only like their 1st and 2nd album)

You should revisit Nile and Origin when you feel ready too

Origin : Informis Infinitas Inhumanitas and Echoes of Decimation

Nile : Annihilation of the Wicked mostly

They are much more brutal than their latest offerings though, so be prepared."
"[Q] Where should I begin from?","then its my bad,because I havent listened Quo Vadis for like 3-4 months.
I will definitely check them today!"

"[Q] Where should I begin from?","I started with [Archspire,](http://youtu.be/vB3Nv-9RxrE) if you like Necrophagist they shouldn't be much of a stretch. On that note, [Obscura](http://youtu.be/mesr2siegRg) might be a good choice, since they're like 2/5ths Necrophagist anyways. [Cryptopsy](http://youtu.be/zQ_2MmuIbcc) is fairly tech-y, some people do t like the vocals, but everything else more than makes up for them. [Beyond Creation](http://youtu.be/v0MkJtI3FvU) is Number One Best Ever. "
"[Q] Where should I begin from?","thanks for your answer!
and why dont like obscura's vocals?"

"Favorite metal counterpoint? (x-post from r/metal)","Counterpoint (multiple voices interdependent in harmony but independent in rhythm and contour) is one of my favorite musical devices, and I'm looking for good examples in really heavy music.

Yes, theory is pretty anal about counterpoint having skips, certain intervals, tritones, etc. but those rules are centuries old and had choral music in mind. Dissonance is an important part of metal anyway, so I'm not worried about those. Really I'm just looking for interesting pairs (or more) of different melodies.

Two examples I find particularly inspiring are [Anata's ""Renunciation""](http://youtu.be/nmUpX_YnTIg?t=2m9s) and [Obscura's ""Septuagint""](http://youtu.be/snDfSqcPHWk?t=4m32s)."

"Favorite metal counterpoint? (x-post from r/metal)","[Spawn of Possession - The Evangelist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl1yCKOQQO8) - first example of loose counterpoint starts ~30sec mark. This song is full of complex harmonies, hopefully this fits the bill"
"Favorite metal counterpoint? (x-post from r/metal)","you may not be able to find metal that abides by the rules of counterpoint, but it sounds like you are looking for complex polyphony with interdependent harmonies. Opeth is really good for those kinds of riffs - [Opeth- The Leper Affinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufRkpTIdGYA) ~56sec   
Also Skeletonwitch has  pieces of riffs that would fit throughout their songs.   
Bands like Gorguts and Nero Di Marte sound like what you are looking for. Obscura named their band after one of Gorguts' albums if you didn't know.  "

"Cattle Decapitation - The Harvest Floor (Full Album)","I'll be seeing them at Heavy MTL this year. Never did like them until that monstrosity known as Monolith of Inhumanity came out last year."
"Cattle Decapitation - The Harvest Floor (Full Album)","I saw them on Summer Slaughter in 2006 and had never even heard of them at that point.  Live show made me a long time fan, and The Harvest Floor completely sealed the deal.  Monolith is amazing and Homovore and Humanure are pretty high up there for me to, although I wouldn't call those albums technical death metal.  Enjoy the show dude!

"Canadian tech death fans are getting a treat: Archspire to tour with Beyond Creation in September/October!","Oh definitely. When tech death bands try to be too technical it cuts out the ""flow"" of the song, and it becomes choppy and synthetic. Beyond Creation found that perfect balance, with the fucking incredible guitar parts, fret-less bass melodies, drums and vocals. Each song has its distinctive melodies which are just incredible. Some of the riffs or melodies actually became really catchy and memorable, which I would say is rare for tech death, they usually get jumbled up and lost in the technicality of the song. I find myself able to lip-scream(?), air drum and air guitar with Beyond Creation songs  "

I wish more tech bands could pull off great song structure along with super-fast noodling. I really don’t feel like there is one weak spot in this band besides the occasional inhale guttural type vocals, which would be better if they were exhale (nothing against inhales, but exhales would sound more intense IMO, but this is also being super picky).

"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","I love Clitoris."
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","I'm not OP but thanks for the links! I knew a couple already but still always awesome to be show new material! What else have you been listening to? "
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Glad I could help! been listening to a lot of stuff haha, pretty much everything I wrote about on the blog as well as that irreversible mechanism album that I managed to get off bandcamp before they took it down. Really just trying to catch up on all the stuff that dropped in 2014 right now. My playlist is like 2,800 songs long. If you want more links let me know and I'll post some when I get home."
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Vale of Pnath are worth a listen too."
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Great band! "
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","These are some angry fast tech death bands: [Vireamia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhvrCOJQ_Fk), [Malebolgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rj4tg7_5GU),
[Henker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyS1BSPK5Mc),
[The Infinite Within](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJod0dFI15A)

This is more in the Archspire style: [First Fragment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBkjuA85rsY), [Cytotoxin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSFzMLA00xk)"
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Man, I wish Vireamia would release some new stuff. And Cytotoxin is pretty good, too. I will check out these other bands. "
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Dude no shit, where the fuck are they? That EP got (and still gets) heavy rotation at my place
Edit: I just listened to Malebolgia, sick AS"
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","You might like Beneath the Massacre and Fleshgod Apocalypse, though they aren't exactly like Archspire. "
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","I'm familiar with both of them. They definitely have similar qualities. I think Archspire may be somewhat of a trend setter in their specific niche of modern death metal. "
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","I completely agree."
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","I wish Monumental Torment had a new album. It's one of the angriest things I've ever listened to. "
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Me too! Really blistering stuff."
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Archspire won album of the year for me. I don't think he does any inhales though. Check out the ""vocal play through"" video. The dude is a beast.

Others have said Monumental Torment. I'll second that. 

I've seen Vale of Pnath mentioned too. That's a great band. 

Posthumous Blasphemer is also good. Check them out. They are a little more slammy but the tech side is definitely there too. "
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Yeah, it's definitely my favorite of the year. Maybe one of the guitarists does backups in Archspire? Check out around this part in this song. I'm pretty sure it's inhales, so it could be backups: http://youtu.be/WEuiZFb2wHY?t=2m4s
I haven't heard Pothumous Blashpemer, and I love slam mixed with tech stuff (there doesn't seem to be too many bands who do). I'll check them out too! "
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","It's not clear in the video if it's inhale or not, but it is clear that it is all him... http://youtu.be/LTOxsbyEHmM

The dude is a freaking beast. I actually don't mind the inhales if that is what he's doing. He kind of just accents with them and I like when vocalists use many techniques. The dude from Acrania is pretty good at having vocal variety too.

For Posthumous Blasphemer, check out this song: http://youtu.be/Z0FlvVyTGPo"
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Ah, okay. Yeah, I don't mind either. That was just me trying to find something wrong with the band if I had to be super picky ha ha. 
I'll check that out. Thanks for the link. "

You may find some stuff in there that you like. If you're in to tech slam stuff, definitely check out that EP from Parasitic Extirpation. Desecravity put out a good one too."
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Thanks, I haven't heard of some of these. I still have to check out Black Crown Initiate. I know the Parasitic Extirpation guys pretty well. Great band, along with the other bands the members play in haha. "
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Ha... Small world. What other banda are they in?"
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Dysentery, Abnormality, Sexcrement. I'm probably missing some others haha. The Coprocephalic guys are cool, too."
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","The name of the band is hilarious and the album is sick so they are alright in my book."
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Man Must Die. Diskreet. Hour of Penance maybe. The Modern Age Slavery is realllllly good too. Sophicide. "
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Great band, played with them last year in Nanaimo."
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","Check out the new Fuck You And Die album..silly band name, awesome tech death. 

Of what hasn't been listed yet:
Gorod, Exmortus, The Greatness Design, Artificial Brain, Hannes Grossman, Pestefier, Illogicist, The Kennedy Veil, the new Job  for a Cowboy record (surprisingly), Neuraxis, Obscura, Origin, Shores of Elysium, the OLD Sun of Aurelius record (new one sucks), Spawn of Possession, Spheron.


keep an eye out for the new Psycroptic.."
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","I was pretty surprised with the new JFAC. Artificial Brain is really sick. They're definitely up there with a top album of 2014 for me. I'll check out a couple of these. Thanks for the nice selection!"
"Archspire, super tech angry death metal fans?","The end all, be all of angry tech death.

"Allegaeon ""Our Cosmic Casket"" (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","What would u call it then? They are classified as technical melodic death metal."
"Allegaeon ""Our Cosmic Casket"" (OFFICIAL VIDEO)","I don't know. Melodic Deathmetal with slight tech influences? Just ask yourself before posting something; does it hold up to the technicality of the list to the right?"

"Rings of Saturn - Utopia [5:30]","Didn't Mann make all his riffs at half speed and in a guitar program for Rings of Saturn?"
"Rings of Saturn - Utopia [5:30]","By now he can actually play this in ""real time""."
"Rings of Saturn - Utopia [5:30]","They cheated to record, but caught up later so they could perform live (kinda like Dragonforce). Either way, the writing is great."
"Rings of Saturn - Utopia [5:30]","Yeah I was on the RoS hate-train for a while, but honestly the writing on the last album really won me over. I don't really care if they can play it live or not, I like the music for what it is."
"Rings of Saturn - Utopia [5:30]","Mann is still an arrogant prick who can't play the new material live unfortunately."
"Rings of Saturn - Utopia [5:30]","Didn't they refute that and also have the album's producer swear to everything being recorded in real-time?  I'm not for/against ROS, I just remember reading about this not too long ago."

"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Archspire, Burning the Masses, Desecrated Sphere, Fleshwrought, Inferi, Ouroboros, Son of Aurelius"
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","First time hearing Fleshwrought, is that a fucking sax?"
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","It's pretty crazy. It's the project of Animals as Leaders' old drummer. It's pretty much all him except vocals. The singer is from Job for a Cowboy."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Nice, this is pretty awesome. I thought I recognized those vocals."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","I also like Animosity, the same drummer guy's old band. Fairly similar sound, though not as diverse."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Have you listened to Gorod yet? A Perfect Absolution is a great album"
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","I like Gorod but it's not the kind of thing I'm looking for."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Not sure what you're looking for then. You did list Obscura and the two are very similar. Have you listened to the 2 newest albums from Gorod?"
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Have you checked out Artificial Brain??"
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","What about beyond creation?"
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Exactly what popped in my head. Whoever DVed you is an idiot."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","I probably got dved because he's got beyond creation in the title, which I didn't notice because my mobile app is flipping out."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Teramobil"
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Not melodic."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Subjective, but OK its not your cup of tea"
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Nah, I like the Gorgutsy sort of stuff, it's just not what I'm looking for right now."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","It might be a stretch but the new animals as leaders album has a lot of slapping and even though there isn't a bassist it's really melodic and basscentric. "
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Not very deathy but, ""spacey, melodic"" and ""lots of bass"" makes me think of proggy bands like [Exivious](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWyEY4oKIOs), and maybe [CHON](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEsdAIQwphE)...maybe not CHON really, I just like the band too much not to share it. 

Edit: maybe [Arkaik](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTtmh_BmELY&amp;feature=kp) too? The chorus is melodic at least."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Not sure how melodic you'd consider them, but [Hideous Divinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNxBa0jou28) is some pretty good and bassy stuff from Italy."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Their bassist is sick."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Spacey &amp; melodic makes me think Dissonance in Design, though I don't know that they're all that heavy on the bass. "
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Beyond Creation has a killer fretless thick bass sound! Some of their songs are really damn atmospheric too."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","[Fallujah](http://fallujah.bandcamp.com/)"
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Gory Blister, Serdce, Thelema, Sadist, Lost Soul, Luciferion, Kosmophobia. 

If you want to get REALLY spacey and far out, try Phlebotomized. They released two albums in the 90s. The second (Skycontact) is more avant-garde than anything, but you should still try it."

"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Give Unhuman a try, some of the same members of Beyond Creation. Completely forgot. Amazing band."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Unhuman is... unhuman. Totally unique band."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Inferi is pretty melodic, not really spacey though "
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","'Dawn Of Dementia' check out the Residuum EP. Killer bass, Primitive Abberation is a good starting point."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Try Arkaik. They are amazing.

Low in the mix, but Inferi and Alterbeast are pretty sweet. I think Dysmorphic has some awesome bass stuff too. 

Edit: The Zenith Passage is another good one. Just check out every band on Unique Leader Records. 

Edit 2: I'm so sorry. I forgot to say that Monumental Torment has some of the best bass lines you can find. Think Beneath the Massacre..."
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Yea, The Zenith Passage is pretty sweet"
"Recommendations for spacey, melodic tech death with lots of bass?","Soreption, Rivers of Nihil"

"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","I think it's phenomenal, but at the same time I think I still like the harvest wombs a bit more."
"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","This is how i felt about it too. All the instruments on THW sounded present and vibrant, while the guitars on TFP sounded lackluster and lacked much of the technicality that was on their previous effort. Ambience may have taken too much of a priority on this album while guitar playing took a bit of a back seat."
"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","A work of art. My favorite album of 2014 so far."
"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","Great."
"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","Absolutely wonderful. The pacing, riffs, ambiance, lyrics, and heaviness are all pitch perfect to me. My favorite album so far this year. Time will tell but l really get the feeling I will be coming back to this for years. I can't stop listening to it.  "
"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","I overall enjoy it."
"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","One of the only Metal albums I've enjoyed in a really long time."
"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","As a whole it's well done, but some of the creative decisions in its mixing / mastering aren't to my personal taste, eg. it's over compressed / limited. Also, and maybe this is just because I've only listened to it 4 or 5 times, but the songs all kind of blend into one big piece, as though variations on a theme and as such there aren't very many parts that sound unique and dare I say, catchy, like on previous releases. Either way I like that it's grandiose and almost cinematic. 87/100"
"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","the three songs they released early completely blew me away, and made my hype boner even stronger. But after listening to the entire album about 5 times through ive found none of the other songs really stand out or blow the mind like ending of sapphire or carved from stone"
"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","I feel like there is way too much filler ambiance for only 40 mins, that should be an extra once you have a respectable album length. I really like Carved from Stone but the rests of the songs are a bit same-ish. "
"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","I'm really disappointed by most of the album, it feels like literally every song they stop playing riffs and just tremolo pick this shitty melody and scream over it with a blast beat.  I absolutely can't stand that shit.

Case and point, first song 3 minutes in they have a nice riff going and then for no reason they play a really really shitty tremolo melody transition into the solo.  If they took out every part of the album where they play that exact same shitty melody, it would be one of the best metal albums I've ever heard.  But instead they played that shitty melody in almost every song.

It starts 1 minute into the second song, a minute and thirty into the third song.  Again throughout the 4th song without the screaming and then fully fledged by the end.  They don't play it in Levitation which is why it's one of my favorite songs on the album.  The 6th song is basically an album lengthener with nothing interesting to report.  The rest of the album is good, but overall I feel like they were really lazy with their songwriting and the album should have been a lot better.
"
"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","I like it but its a little to..""ambient"" for my liking. Its suffering from the same reason why I didn't like Fleshgod's Labyrinth...too much overbearing orchestra which drowned out the actual metal."
"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","Probably one of the top tech death albums this year.

My only gripe with the band is at times the riffs seem *too* copy and paste. Not in that they are cliche in any way, but the way they are played can be so repetitive. Any band does this, but with Fallujah is seems to stand out way more for me. I think it could just be the pace at which they play."
"What are your thoughts about the new Fallujah album?","Incredibly boring, and the general -coreness of the album keeps taking me out of the music every time I try listening to it. Definitely not bad, but not something I like. Same goes for everything ever done by The Faceless. "

"OMAAF - Jupiter's Domain","Pretty fucking sweet guys. OMAAF is an Alabama four-piece that had a new album out on October 15th. Their name is short for Of Men and Angel's Flesh. What does your name mean? 

https://omaaf.bandcamp.com/  oooh full album."
"OMAAF - Jupiter's Domain","Sorry for the super late response.  The name comes man's desire to be closer to perfection.  In the mythical tales of the bible apparently man wanted to be like the angels, yet the the angels were jealous of man and wanted to be more like them.  Angels were not allowed any of the emotions or freedom that man was.  Though the angel's were considered near perfection as their status was closer to god they were actually prisoners damned to eternity never to feel and never to love.  The name was a metaphor for the irony that is ""perfection"" and the prison that perfection really is.  Obtaining such a thing would make one less human.  I always imagined the image of a man standing in a room, sorrowfully squeezing into an angel costume (or a suit made of an angel flesh) and in the next room a angel putting on a human costume.  The title for the song ""angelskingarden"" by crpytopsy was the catalyst for the name.  The meaning was an idea I had floating around in my head for over 10 years.  Also thank you very much for your interest and time.

"What should I be listening to?","Hello Everyone!

I love this shit, and I want a recommendation or two, as I feel I have been stuck for a while. Some things I love include:

Gorguts
Lykathea Aflame
Gorod: Leading Vision
Opeth: Morningrise, Orchid, etc.
Cryptopsy: None So Vile, Cryptopsy, Blasphemy Made Flesh
Code

Aaaand much more. for more data: my last.fm name is [Etothe3](http://www.last.fm/user/Etothe3).

Any thoughts?"
"What should I be listening to?","I would highly recommend Obscura. "
"What should I be listening to?","Well, the Gorguts CD by that name is my favorite metal album by far, but I have not listened to that band yet... Ill check it out!"
"What should I be listening to?","Son of Aurelius, Archons, Systematik, Vale of Pnath, and Allegaeon have been my favorites lately. Not neccesarily like any of the bands you listed, but sick metal nonetheless. "
"What should I be listening to?","In no particular order:

Necrophagist, 
Abysmal Dawn, 
Gorod, 
Decapitated, 
Ouroboros, 
Psycroptic, 
Obscura, 
Spawn of Possession, 
Hour of Penance, 
Beyond Creation
"
"What should I be listening to?","I'm already a big fan of Gorod, Decapitated, and Beyond Creation, so I will definitely check these out!"
"What should I be listening to?","I see you only have leading vision listed for gorod albums. If you haven't yet, you absolutely MUST listen to their album ""process of a new decline"", probably my favorite TDM album of all time

Also check out ""a perfect absolution"" by gorod if you havnt"

"Started to try to learn this yesterday","To be fair? We aren't dividing rations amongst the starving in a 3rd world country here man. This is TECHDEATH. Nothing about this submission is technical or complex. It is 'fair' to say that it's a rather simple tapping technique. The complexities and techniques used on Death I validate the reason it did so well in this subreddit. IMO this song just does not fit here."
"Started to try to learn this yesterday","It's actually rather complex when you actually look at what he's doing melodically with it(modulation, counter point, etc).  The time signature is also rather complex and jumps around a bunch (15/16, 12/16, 10/16, etc).  Not to mention the fact it requires 4 finger tapping, so I wouldn't say that this is ""simple tapping technique"".  Nonetheless, well received on it being the wrong genre.  My bad."

I'd like your recommendations for spazzy, technical brutal death. I mean stuff with ridiculous amounts of pinch harmonics, spazzy time and tempo changes, but that still maintains some sense of groove. And the more slams the better!

For example, stuff along the lines of the following:

* Malignancy - [Inhuman Grotesqueries](http://willowtip.bandcamp.com/album/inhuman-grotesqueries)
* Embryonic Devourment - [Fear of Reality Exceeds Fantasy](http://embryonicdevourment.bandcamp.com/album/the-fear-of-reality-exceeds-fantasy)

"Recommend me crazy technical brutal death","[Putridity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pklWqxbHbPk) fits the description pretty well, fast, brutal, heavy dosage of pinch harmonics.

[Excoriation](https://newstandardelite.bandcamp.com/album/excoriation-excoriation) fits if you don't mind the caveman approach they took


I'm not sure those are the most spastic though, from thw comments though I can recommend the following (that fits your query) :

-Wormed - Planisphaerium (Spastic award along with the way they blend in the slam riffs, sick album)


-Putridity - Degenerating Anthropophagical Euphoria (THIS IS YOUR JAM OP, like a really brutal malignancy, no joke)

Hmm okay not quite as many as I thought, though I'm sure I'm leaving out many. Still, here are four well-esteemed death metal bands, each of whom scrapped the low death growls for a higher pitched style of singing. Anyone else noticed this and is bothered when bands do it? "
"What is with the hugely prominent trend of (technical) death metal bands ditching the death growls for more core-style vocals later in their careers?","Just a general trend I'm presuming. These kind of vocals aren't just used in 'core music, but in lots of math metal, 'postish' material and lots of hybrid genres.

Given that death metal has become more eclectic in recent years, and I could see how  characteristics from other genres become incorperated into it.

"What is with the hugely prominent trend of (technical) death metal bands ditching the death growls for more core-style vocals later in their careers?","The growls are harder to do.

I dig it man. It's pretty unique as far as tech death goes, but some songs definitely have a very Beyond Creation feel to them. Which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but they're definitely not reinventing the wheel.

Favorite track is A Global Shift, I think. Super heavy while maintaining creativity and subtlety."

"Brought by Pain from Montreal (I'm on vocals)","I listened to it a few times and thought it was pretty good, with some stand-out tracks like Two Pound Torch, but recently I've gone back and listened again and it's even better than I thought. It's very dense, drums are insanely creative and the songwriting is very good. There is no filler here, it's a really solid modern DM album, powerful enough to make me forget about TUK. Hell, even Gauchy improved a LOT

Edit : My only concern is the snare sound, it's far too conventional and flat to be a cryptopsy snare, it needs to have the trash can sound! :P"

"No Unquestionable Presence?","They were the most technical death metal band around when they released that album. They basically invented the genre when they released *Piece Of Time* in 1989. People call *Symbolic* technical even though it mostly consists of power chord riffs. I'm sorry but this band pushed technical boundaries in their time. There was a time when ""technical"" didn't mean 300bpm sweep picking. "

"Arkaik - ""Metamorphignition""  (Guitar Pro Tabs in comments)","This was an amazing album. Really good balance between being techy and heavy at the same time. "

Edit: not a bad thing"
"Any Suggestions?","I posted the Beyond Creation post not too long ago and you guys threw a lot of great bands my way. I'm back looking for something along those lines but much for.... Aggressive? I was listening to old music I used to listen to in middle school ( Suicide Silence mostly. Hey. We all transition into the big stuff differently. ) And on one particular song ,"" Eyes Sewn Shut "", there was a point where the bass line just hit me. It's a common technique used in Tech Death but I don't know what it's called. If you can't hear it in that song, it's very prevalent in a lot of Brutal Death Metal songs such as Goemagot's "" Bigotry "". Here's how the technique is normally executed:

1. Fast playing with higher BPMs than usual
2. All music ceases for a fraction of a second
3. Bass guitar drops a riff
4. Slam or solo ( Normally, or and even high BPM )

This technique delivers the music in a fashion that I /really/ ( mobile. Can't italicize. ) enjoy. I'm versatile when it comes to death metal of course but if you guys could limit yourselves to bands like; Abominable Putridity, Kyojin Daigyakusatu, Extermination Dismemberment, Origin, Brain Drill, Monumental Torment, that'd be great."
"Any Suggestions?","You mean like a bass fill?

Edit: 1:40

http://youtu.be/rkNbTS7uhLE"
"Any Suggestions?","Exactly like that. Just a tad less background noise... Reminded me of how good Cryptopsy is."
"Any Suggestions?","Ah, alright. I think on the track In The Kingdom Where Everything Dies... from Once Was Not has some more audible ones."
"Any Suggestions?","Ouhhh. Cryptopsy is just delicious. The groove after the bass fill fills me with that ""YIIIIRRHH! THE RIFF!!""-feeling"
"Any Suggestions?","You mean something like the beginning of Aborted - Fecal Forgery ?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3aOjhPpdCg"
"Any Suggestions?","Yes. That. I actually haven't given that album a chance although the vocal work is very nice."
"Any Suggestions?","Well, they will release another album this month so you've got some catching up to do ;)

I've found another bass intro: http://youtu.be/Hu9oMFxypco?t=23m21s"
"Any Suggestions?","Haha, that's alright. I'm caught up with their discography up until the latest album. I was just very sketchy when it came out because of how different the guitars sounded on a promo."
"Any Suggestions?","[Defeated Sanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw4n8geklDk) first min.

[Putridity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN58oCdXUBw) right at the beginning.

[Suffocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3WI-GUt2lk) @ 2 mins

[Kataklysm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AUUiDxiZO8) @ 3 mins &lt;- this thing HNNNGGG"
"Any Suggestions?","Defeated Sanity - I've been needing an excuse to listen to more of their music. Found.

Putridity - My favorite Brutal Death Metal band. Hands down.

Suffocation - Gods among their genre.

Kataklysm - I... Boy. I need to change my pants."
"Any Suggestions?","[Hmm](http://archspire.stereokiller.com/)"
"Any Suggestions?","Dude. That album makes me great. It's the best I've heard so far this year. The vocals and guitars on the album are perfect."
"Any Suggestions?","Totally, it's really hard for me to choose whether I like this or the new Artificial Brain album more, but it's difficult to even compare the two, as they are so fundamentally different. Really excited to see if Origin releases a mammoth of an album this year."
"Any Suggestions?","If Origin releases an album, so long as it doesn't slow down, I guarantee it will too metal charts. I haven't heard anything about it yet, but if you have, could you link the source?"
"Any Suggestions?","Pretty much all I've heard

"Any Suggestions?","http://archspire.stereokiller.com/
you heard the new archspire right?"
"Any Suggestions?","Haha. Already linked. The new archspire is the definition of talent. I showed them to my metally challenged ( pun intended ) SO. She even loved it."
"Any Suggestions?","I know I'm late to the party, but what about [Alterbeast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gI3W15-9_Q)?"
"Any Suggestions?","You're never too late to make suggestions. Never listened to any Alterbeast... I'm going to now though. "
"Any Suggestions?","Oh man you are in for a treat.  One of the best albums of the Year so far."
"Any Suggestions?","I have listened to this song 1 1/2 times since I sent that. I drooled a bit halfway through. This is amazing. The bass fill wasn't as heavy as I'd like but the rest of this track was amazing. It reminded me a bit of Fleshgod minus the orchestra, and mix a little more technicality. Beautiful. "
"Any Suggestions?","Ikr.  I always know when a song that's playing while I'm driving is theirs cause it just sounds so fucking perfect."
"Any Suggestions?","Haha. The highs were just right. I never really like highs too much but I'll be damned if those we're nearly perfect. I'm putting this album right under Archspire. Archspire released a god-tier album yesterday. "
"Any Suggestions?","Oh yea been listening to a lot of archspire lately lol.  That album is one giant eargasm."
"Any Suggestions?","I'm very late to the party, but check out [Allegaeon's Secret of the Sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q6DiyYPh1M&amp;feature=kp) and also their [A Path Disclosed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKqUOiYoEAE). Both should have what you're looking for at least in parts and Allegaeon fucking kills it."
"Any Suggestions?","What you're describing sounds to me like technical brutal death metal. Is it single songs or bands in general you are looking for? 
What about [Carnifex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97szX86HBGE) or more aggressive like [Lost Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlyBVsMgKT0). Perhaps [The Red Shore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9en1plZNKI)?"

Also interested in Alkaloid.

Probably most excited for Gorod.

EDIT: Almost forgot. The Schoenberg Automaton have Apus coming out early in the new year. Pretty excited for that, even if they're moving to Canada.

Arkaik have been teasing something due next year as well, that should be fun. "

"DECAPITATED - Blood Mantra (OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO)","I liked Organic Hallucinosis. It was techy, modern (don't get me wrong, their earlier work is the best imo) and filled with interesting grooves. 

To me they're almost taking out the death elements. Nothing dirty about it anymore. The riffs almost sound like they've been picked off the discount modern metal shelves."
"DECAPITATED - Blood Mantra (OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO)","for me, the problem with all the albums after The Negation are the vocals. way too metalcore for their riffs. "

"What are some lesser known tech death bands that you feel deserve more attention?","The guitarist of HAARP was critiqued (mainly by Misha Mansoor) for faking a lot of his parts on the album, like recording one note at a time or recording parts at slower speeds. He also released a Strandberg guitar video promo video that shows video of him playing but has pretty clearly faked sound. It was backed up by the fact that he couldnt really play his own songs live when the band started touring.

Seriously though, when I first got into them, Psycroptic were very obscure (being from Tasmania, understandable).  Their two albums, The Isle of Disenchantment and The Scepter of the Ancients, blew me away.  If you haven't heard them, I highly recommend listening to those two albums first.

Seems like they are following a similar path to Arkaik, if anyone digs them. Their first album was pretty much straight-forward brutality (Reflections Within Dissonance) and then really stepped it up with their Sophomore album in terms of songwriting and production (Metamorphignition).

"ALTERBEAST - Ancient's Retribution","I was thinking the same thing. The only album that I think will compete is The Path of Apotheosis by Inferi. I think it will win because it's 3 times as long. 

I am sure that Alterbeast will be a 10/10 judging of the 4 songs they've released. "

“Balkanized”

I’m standing on the platform

And there’s a pile of trash bags

Swollen with former objects of desire

Stripped of office, like corrupted priests

In black plastic vestments


And cast out to vagrancy

So now they wait with me

Twitching with the palsy

Of the rats in their guts

That shriek as the train approaches

To take me home


There’s a negative copy of me

In a bus station on a dusty plain

A thousand miles away


And one day we’ll meet

Swept up by different flags

We’ll lock eyes through gunsights

And I wonder which one of us

Will die beneath the other’s knives

And I hope it will be him

It’s not personal

But I’ll rip your throat out if I have to

I’ll tear your guts out if I’m asked to

You’ll rip my throat out if you have to

You’ll tear my guts out if you’re asked to



It’s nothing personal

Because we’re both the same

Lemmings rushing away from a mirror

And towards a cliff"

"
"Style of tech death","Why do you say it could have been the ""flagship sound""?

+1 for Anata. I wish they would release another album."
"Style of tech death","Planetary Duality is an album that meets the demands of being considered techdeath, and is also extremely unique, yet modern, at the same time. It bridges the gap between the younger 'core' crowd and the traditional techdeath crowd. It's an album I think everyone can agree on. But The Faceless took a turn away from the unique sound of Planetary Duality and I suspect they won't visit it again. That's just how I feel about it. But thankfully [The Zenith Passage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHRLGWIRhfA) is doing good work!

I've gotten word that Anata is over. :("
"Style of tech death","Also, Artificial Brain really reminds me of ""Lykathea Aflame"". Anyone else get that vibe?"
"Style of tech death","I was actually considering putting them up with Artificial Brain! I hear they're back together or something?"
"Style of tech death","Upvotes like hell for mentioning Anata. The Conductors Departure was probably one of my all-time favorite albums. "
"Style of tech death","I'm in the minority here, I am not a fan of atonal or overly ""mathy"" Tech Death. I prefer stuff that leans melodic but is still very difficult to play, I listen to tech death to be impressed by skill and to enjoy the tune. My favorite group right now is [Ade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGO1chg-mg8)"
"Style of tech death","*Spartacus* is a great album. Kollias is a fucking beast! "
"Style of tech death","I'll have to check them out. I like how you stated that you're a minority, that in the metal scene is too common. Like what you will like and I'll consider you a tech fan all the same brother."
"Style of tech death","I like wormed, decapitated, and hour of penance type of stuff."
"Style of tech death","Decapitated is some absolutely wonderful shit. All day. Everyday."
"Style of tech death","Gorguts? Can I include Psycroptic too?"
"Style of tech death","Include who ever you want mang "
"Style of tech death","I wouldn't include Psycroptic's latest, but certainly Symbols of Failure."
"Style of tech death","It was a groovy album but I felt it was definitely missing something."
"Style of tech death","I'm a big fan of really thick and juicy sounding bands like Rivers of Nihil, Deeds of Flesh, Ulcerate, and Artificial Brain."
"Style of tech death","I absolutely love Rivers of Nihil "
"Style of tech death","Fucking Artificial Brain! I'm so happy that band exists!"
"Style of tech death","I like to listen to Decrepit Birth when I'm smoking weed."
"Style of tech death","I don't listen to a TON of tech death, but when I'm lifting I love to listen to Beneath the Massacre. Beyond Creation is probably my favorite tech death to listen to when I'm just hanging out. I also really like Allegaeon and they're local for me "
"Style of tech death","Beyond creation is great. Just started getting into them"
"Style of tech death","Beyond Creation are pretty sweet i listen to them to kill my depression from time to time"
"Style of tech death","Have you heard Inferi? Not the same as Beyond Creation but also awesome"
"Style of tech death","I'll have to give them a listen"
"Style of tech death","Absolutely hear you on beneath the massacre when im doing any kind of work whether it's cleaning my place,office work,or working out."
"Style of tech death","Check out my post titled ""Beyond Creation"". They play a quite aggressive style of technical death metal, but not nearly as aggressive as bands such as Beneath the Massacre or Origin. Bands like Beyond are most acts that their bassist is associated with, due to his fret less being the major turn on in Beyond. Other than that, I'm loving Separatist, Origin, Hour of Penance, Fleshgod Apocalypse, and many more. "
"Style of tech death","""Bands like Beyond are most acts that their bassist is associated with"" what are you trying to say there"
"Style of tech death","Words, man. I have no clue what happened with my brain there. I was saying that if you want to hear something like Beyond Creation, listen to other bands that Forest plays for. "
"Style of tech death","Right on i love teramobil. Kinda hectic"
"Style of tech death","I'm still hanging on to Necrophagist, Muhammed's solos are just incredible.
Also, I can't stop listening to Alterbeast. "
"Style of tech death","As am I...as am I."
"Style of tech death","What I feel like listening to is generally on a whim, i.e. I might remember a band/song and want to hear it. Not really ""I'm in the mood for X right now"".

* [A Loathing Requiem - False Gods Render Death](http://youtu.be/94vLxK_uRxM): don't know much by them, but this song is good

* [Inferi - The Path to Apotheosis (full album)](http://youtu.be/ShiEuQk5agg): very fast, very good solos (without sounding too much like wankery). called ""technical melodic death metal"" on metal-archives

* [Ouroboros - Glorification of a Myth (full album)](http://youtu.be/3ynO1sGBCQs): not as good or as tech, but still worth a listen

* Anything by Obscura

* [Son of Aurelius - The First, The Serpent](http://youtu.be/gfS4I2-Srok): I love this song, and love the solo. The rest of the album is pretty good, but this one sticks out to me

* The final album by !T.O.O.H.! Close to grind in some ways, but it's pretty amazing. Especially when you get to the end of the final track. Quite the finale for that band.

* Anata. Not quite tech death, but I especially like their final album, The Conductor's Departure.

* Ekser: they only have one album but it's pretty good.

* Gorod: all of it. In my opinion, they have gotten better with each release. Probably my second favorite band overall.

* Neuraxis: I prefer their earlier stuff

* Pavor: only 2 releases as far as I know. Really dirty-sounding stuff. I like this song and solo: [A Schizoid Uglifier](http://youtu.be/aypCsEpgnqY). If you like bass, you might like this band. This is insane stuff.

* [Spawn of Possession - The Apparition](http://youtu.be/7oT9_1zEDEA): nothing to be said about it. Fantastic song. If Gorod hadn't had a release that year, this would have been the best song of 2012.

* I like Capharnaum's only 2 albums. But they're too short, and the vocals on the second one aren't that good (the guy from Trivium, I think)"
"Style of tech death","!T.O.O.H.!"
"Style of tech death","&gt; A Loathing Requiem - False Gods Render Death[1] : don't know much by them, but this song is good

It's the solo project of Inferi and Diskreet guitarist Malcolm Pugh! Insanely catchy stuff."
"Style of tech death","I love Soreption. I love the crisp clean over produced drums and absolutely crushing guitar riffs. The bass is always audible but most of all I like the tight guitar playing. 

As a guitarist I love listening to any kind of metal with tight fast widdly guitar line. Now I don't mean bands like Origin. To me they come off as a tad sloppy or rushed. But bands like The Faceless, Soreption, Gorod, Spawn of Possesion, Necrophagist, Obscura and many others similar where you KNOW it took them some time to master a few of those riffs, that brings me a lot of goosebumped listens.
."
"Style of tech death","How on earth can 300 bpm not seem rushed. I agree on everything but the origin comment."
"Style of tech death","Another guitar player here. I appreciate Origin, but their guitars do certainly sound sloppy and rushed. I think it's due to their tone (mostly high frequencies) and amount of distortion mostly, but the riffs they write don't really help for sounding precise and tight. But you have a strong point about the bpm, tremolo picking 16th notes at 300 bpm is going to sound rushed and sloppy now matter how tight you are.

Edit: wrong 'their'."
"Style of tech death","I know, it was pretty poor wording but the other person who replied kind of nailed my point. "
"Style of tech death","I love listening to incredibly wanky or compositionally challenging tech death when I'm doing research or writing grants/papers (I'm a grad student studying cancer pharmacology). Puts me in the zone to just think deeply. Band examples- Viraemia, Spawn of Possession, Fleshgod Apocalypse (first album and mafia), Archspire, Demilich, Beyond Creation, Nile etc."
"Style of tech death","Mindfuck solos -&gt; revocation.  
Mindfuck riffage and songwriting -&gt; spawn of possession.  
Beautiful lyrics and mystically progressive Songs -&gt; rivers of nihil.  
Godlike basslines -&gt; obscura, beyond creation, augury, depending on my need for progression, outer space weirdness and heaviness.  
Over the Top precision and groove -&gt; soreption"
"Style of tech death","I personally prefer bands that don't sound too over produced. Gorguts, rivers of nihil, and necrophagist are some examples of what I like"
"Style of tech death","While i love rivers of Nihil the album sounded over produced."
"Style of tech death","Yeah I have to admit you're right there, however for some reason I don't notice/mind as much with that album"
"Style of tech death","It's all about the riffs for me man"
"Style of tech death","Maybe it's because I'm a Canadian who came of metal age in the late 90's-2000's, but my favourite tech death will always be the original insane Canadian shit: Cryptopsy's [None so Vile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkNbTS7uhLE) is maybe the best death metal album ever, and Kataklym's [Temple of Knowledge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiim_SKNULM) has a similar sound. And of course, Gorgut's [Obscura](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1X0Bejwnko) which is not only technical in crazy time changes or fretboard gymnastics, but progressively pushes boundaries of tonality and harmony in ways no band has really done since. What I love about all this French Canadian shit is that sort of raw ""mid-fi"" production and crazy energy- that it's kind of sloppy and ahead of the beat (pre-protools) but also masterful. There's a tension and intensity that comes to the surface as a sort of emotional push.  
Another great Canadian tech record is The End's [Transfer Trachea Reverberations for Point: False Omniscient](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_-49_pxKdQ), which is a bit more of that Willowtip style of the mid-2000's, but a really stellar performance, especially in the vocals. Great dark, painful atmosphere."
"Style of tech death","Don't hate I've been listening to Meshuggah lately."
"Style of tech death","[deleted]"
"Style of tech death","Decrepit Birth. The guitar solos make me feel like I am being flown across the universe on an alien space ship. "
"Style of tech death","i enjoy Inferi, Beyond Creation, Decrepit Birth, Cattle Decapitation, Enfold Darkness, Archspire, Soreption, Arkaik, Cognizance, Deeds of Flesh, Diskreet, Gorod, Hideous Divinity, Necrophagist, Obscura, Odious Mortem, Ovid's Withering, Rivers of Nihil, Severed Savior, Son of Aurelius, Sophicide, Smaragos, Spheron, Spawn of Possession, Suffocation, Unhuman, Upheaval, Vale of Pnath, Warforged, Wretched, The Zenith Passage. etc. etc. theres more i just quickly went though my windows media player library. "
"Style of tech death","Top five for me, regardless of mood
1. Nile
2. Hour of Penance
3. Decapitated
4. Beyond Creation
5. Spawn of Possession"
"Style of tech death","*[Thelema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqW2OITfcSI) - Jazzy, progressive, anthemic sounding tech death. Not a lot of people have heard Thelema, and thats a damn shame. 

*[Pavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSAMtGQwle8) - Their second album (Furioso) is a beast! The bass solos... my gawd the bass solos.

*[Sophicide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EooVEeBbbA) - Impressive new band in the genre.

"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","[Neuraxis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YDzwhj_E) is pretty damn good too."

"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","Obscura is very similar to beyond creation"
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","Obvious choice is [Augury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hlSMQ-_WAU) (same bass player as in Beyond Creation). Maybe less melodic but more technical would be [Martyr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_moWrwOvTeo), also from Quebec. [Gorod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCNxvZLmlQo) is also worth mentioning (surprised no-one else has brought them up yet)."
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","[Arsis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHC9w7pCIMQ) - about as technical as it gets, but never losing sight of a melody."
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","Try Fallujah. They are technical and melodic with brutality"
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","Yeah Fallujah are awesome. But I didn't think they were techdeath?"
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","They're a good mixture of many things, it's hard to put them into one category. If you haven't heard already listen to the album ""the harvest wombs."" I think that might be what you're going for"

"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","Neuraxis, Vale of Pnath, uuhh.....Obscura in SOME cases, The Black Dahlia Murder (only a few songs though, theyre pretty heavy), Arsis' newer albums had more melody, etc"
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","[deleted]"
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","The newer [Psycroptic](https://www.facebook.com/psycroptic) stuff is definitely very melodic.  The new song that they'll be releasing soon is bloody awesome, but for now check out [Carriers of the Plague](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RePiuFxp7H4)."

"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","This is such a shit bot..."
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","I haven't seen thes mentioned yet, definitely check out Archons, they are fuckin sick. Also Symbolik, he only has a demo out but it is amazing. Woe of Tyrants are great as long as you ignore their Christian background. 

I will also second these ones that have been mentioned already:

Son of Aurelius

Allegaeon

Vale of Pnath

Arsis"
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","Well there's At the Gates, Quo Vadis, and Arch Enemy, but I'm sure you know of them and they are a bit off from what you asked for but noteworthy nonetheless.

I think [Anata](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6Dm42zSec) fits the bill for melodic techdeath better than most other bands out there.

Just heard of [Wretched](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtKgveqZFlw) recently, they are pretty fuckin' killer.

[Necrophagist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9RJXWxth5g), although they tend to be pretty hit and miss for people.

---

Heathen Shrine is a friend's band that put out some seriously kick ass music, they only have 5 high quality recorded song on the internet and only two are on youtube (they have all 5 on spotify though). I'm not positive that they plan on putting anything else out though (life has a tendency to interrupt people's plans).

Youtube links:

* [I am Rasputin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sq8pGDSM08)

* [Caster of Stones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYgCvp1_nek)

Spotify link to (IMO) their best song and the rest of the album: https://play.spotify.com/album/638QfYcyhPH4lSxaxf20P8"
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","I wouldn't say that At The Gates are Tech Death. THey are just Melodeath. And At The Gates are the creators of Tech Death overall. Still great and ATG is my favorite band"
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","I can highly recommend The Faceless.

[Here's a song from Planetary Duality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2UNXm_2yH0)

[And here one from their current album which is more melodic but great nonetheless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIG_bEfGvIY)"
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","Enfold Darkness
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntWbq8nQyws"
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","[Allegaeon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA3dwjjIYEE)

[Revocation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3zB6di2yR4)

[The Black Dahlia Murder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V5qFy5cniY)

[Neuraxis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YDzwhj_E)

[Enfold Darkness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XugATtBPBPU)

[Benighted](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MeaH183u2Q)

[Miseration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_btqt55X5C8)

[Death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02n4kKLUC4k) (only last couple albums)

[Mercenary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KSvS3WOU-g) (also somewhat power metal-ish)

[Wretched](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJzHab3HtFc)

[Fleshgod Apocalypse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sACuX2c9w8s) (symphonic)

[Within the Ruins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfiBc9QTjl0) (deathcore, but I'd still recommend this album)"
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","This might be a little too core, but have you tried: after the burial or as blood runs black?"
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","They're alright. When I used to like core more I listened to them."
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","Inferi are pretty good, if you don't mind a teensy-bit of metalcore styling. Malcolm Pugh from Diskreet/Enfold Darkness is the lead guitarist and shreds hard throughout. "
"Suggestions for TechDeath bands that are melodic?","Ne obliviscaris. Check the new album."

"Deconversion - Internal Cosmic Intervention","Reminds me a lot like Decrepit Birth. Look forward to their full release!"
"Someone decided to mix one of my songs professionally (Peavey 6505, Mesa cab), Tech death w/ vocals for fans of The Faceless!",""
"Someone decided to mix one of my songs professionally (Peavey 6505, Mesa cab), Tech death w/ vocals for fans of The Faceless!","Great production quality; I like the song as well.

I don't really consider it TDM though.  It reminds me a lot more of Born of Osiris than of The Faceless.  Let me reiterate that I enjoyed this, but the scarcity of leads, relatively common chords and triads, and conventional song structure combined with the breakdowns, general tone, and use of melody make this a (good) deathcore song with some prog and technical elements.

Just my opinion of course, it is a blurry line."
"Someone decided to mix one of my songs professionally (Peavey 6505, Mesa cab), Tech death w/ vocals for fans of The Faceless!","Yeah that's what I was going for, some deathcore/tech death mix, ""Part 2"" of this song is definitely inspired on BOO, thanks for the crit man"

"Archspire - Fathom Infinite Depth","Seven Crowns and the Oblivion Chain is my jam right now.  The only thing that tops this album is The Flesh Prevails....maybe, I haven't decided yet."

Hell, if nothing better comes out, it might as well be album of the decade."
"Archspire - Fathom Infinite Depth","I still dream of Necrophagist :("
"Archspire - Fathom Infinite Depth","Not even Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails?"
"Archspire - Fathom Infinite Depth","I just gave it a listen. I must admit that their instrumentals are progressive and forward-thinking, but I feel like the vocals are just kinda meh; they're decent, but I don't think it brings anything new to the table. Archspire's release is groundbreaking on all levels; every facet. Every second of every song is stimulating to me."

"Technical Death Metal bands with non-death/gore lyrics?","I haven't really listened to any Technical Death Metal besides Gojira and I'm not even sure what genre Gojira is, so what are some good technical death metal bands that do not sing about death/gore/horror/any dark subjects? I'd rather not listen to those.

EDIT: btw I really dig Gojira's sound."
"Technical Death Metal bands with non-death/gore lyrics?","Listen to the lyrics?   I doubt you'll be able to understand the majority of them.  I don't understand someone who would not listen to a BAND because of the lyrics.  The point is the music isn't it?  Especially, technical death metal which is a sub-genre focusing on the musicianship?"

Find a band, look up lyrics.... Yes/No."
"Technical Death Metal bands with non-death/gore lyrics?","Not at the right place for Gojira, as for lyrics does it really matter? You won't be able to hear the lyrics anyway.

To get you rolling: Nile, Decrepit Birth (ignore the name, lol) and Wormed. 

There would be more but I'm just not all that knowledgeable about most lyrics that bands write. Death metal isn't all gory stuff so it shouldn't be too hard to find."
"Technical Death Metal bands with non-death/gore lyrics?","then don't, that's what deaths' metal is about...

cynic, atheist, dim mak."
"Technical Death Metal bands with non-death/gore lyrics?","Allegaeon, they sing mostly about science and similar things. Not such dark lyrics, but these dudes are right, if you really want to get away from dark topics instrumental metal will be your best bet. "
"Technical Death Metal bands with non-death/gore lyrics?","I'd put Gojira in the progressive death metal camp, but it's still kinda hard to really put a specific subgenre tag on them.

In reality, you'd be kinda hard-pressed to find very many techdeath bands with gory lyrics. There's tons of gore/slam death out there that are ONLY focused on the most shocking gory lyrics, and they are very musically extreme, but I don't classify them as techdeath.

"Technical Death Metal bands with non-death/gore lyrics?","I'm with everyone else here. Technical death metal isn't about the lyrics. It's the music. If you really care about lyrics enough to look them up, use the metallum. Even lighter albums that I know of are moderately dark in content. That's just the atmosphere of the sub genre. Did you check out the sidebar though? The top ten is pretty clean, excluding Necrophagist. The others are dark in nature but there isn't too much gore to be found there."

"Job For A Cowboy - Sun Eater (2014)","Nick Schendzielos was the saving grace for this album. I love every JFAC album but he makes this one really unique."
"Job For A Cowboy - Sun Eater (2014)","that bass tone is amazing."
"Job For A Cowboy - Sun Eater (2014)","I didn't know he was on this album until I checked the lineup after giving it a listen. I'm a big Cephalic Carnage fan and I gave this one a try (like I have with all JFAC's previous efforts, but to little avail), and I was practically drooling over that bass tone. By far their best and most unique effort to date, in my opinion."
"Job For A Cowboy - Sun Eater (2014)","I've been listening to JFAC since day one. I never really liked any of their early death-supercore stuff but this album really highlights their change in style, they've gotten soooo much better"
"Job For A Cowboy - Sun Eater (2014)","Its annoying to see people say like ""wow what a twist"" when talking about JFAC. They havent been deathcore since 2007 and their last 2 albums have been pretty much borderline tech-death. This album seems to perfectly align with what they've been slowly going for, and didn't surprise me when its full on tech-death. Can't wait to hear what they choose to do next."
"Job For A Cowboy - Sun Eater (2014)","I know a fair amount of people who have the same opinion as me regarding their previous efforts and kind of have the, ""wow, what a twist"" reaction when I think about this album. Basically, I thought their other tech-death-ish albums were all kind of watered-down and uninspired. Granted, it's all just a matter of opinion, but I found it difficult for any of their previous material to actually stick after a few listens. This is a ""twist"" to me in that it was surprising; refreshing. Totally not bashing your opinion on the matter, though. I don't wanna come across that way. "
"Job For A Cowboy - Sun Eater (2014)","I agree its a big twist in the sense that it is their best album yet and is really good, but people are constantly saying like ""Wow i thought they were deathcore this is a turn for the better!"" And I'm just sitting here like come on man they've been either tech death or regular death metal for a long time"
"Job For A Cowboy - Sun Eater (2014)","These guys are techdeath now? Wow..."
"Job For A Cowboy - Sun Eater (2014)","Have been since after their first album really. Their only properly deathcore stuff was their first EP."
"Job For A Cowboy - Sun Eater (2014)","They've been tech death since Ruination (2009), but this album is by far the best tech death they've made imo."
"Job For A Cowboy - Sun Eater (2014)","The mood the guitar creates and the melody counterpoint created by the bass is brilliant. Best album of 2014 IMO"
"Job For A Cowboy - Sun Eater (2014)","One of my favorite albums of 2014. I love that they didn't just put out the same music they have in the past. Has a very proggy feel to it."
