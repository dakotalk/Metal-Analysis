"Soulfly-JumpDaFuckUp (ft. Corey Taylor)","Yes,what about Soulfly?"

"Searching for an album! Element Eighty","Honestly, I LOVE Element Eighty. To the point where I seem weird. Their albums are extremely hard to come by and i've been searching for a long time. I thought I would ask for some assistance in the matter. I live in Australia, if that changes things such as shipping (if you even find anything)

Things ive already done:
eBay, first option. (all american, not shipping to Australia)
Local record stores (say they have ""nothing on their database"")

Thanks!"
"Searching for an album! Element Eighty","If you can get it shipped to my address and pay for me to ship it to Aus, however much that would cost. I'll gladly do it. Or I can look around if local record stores have anything if I'm in one... "
"Searching for an album! Element Eighty","That would be great. Have a look through your record stores when you get a chance and contact me if something comes up? I'll keep looking online and I'll see if I can find something.

Really appreciate it.
"
"Searching for an album! Element Eighty","I used to live in Europe and absolutely hated how almost nothing could be shipped there from the States and even if the eBay seller did ship, it was at an upcharge. Now that I'm here, I enjoy the convenience, and no import fees. Totally understand your frustration"
"Searching for an album! Element Eighty","So I've found quite a few CDs on eBay (*in the U.S. of course). It looks like the cheapest is going to run 3.50USD. I don't know how much it would cost for me to ship to Australia, though."

"looking for a band similar to koRn ","Hi Reddit, i have been listening to Metal for several Years now, KoRn was always one of my favorite Bands, but i have never found any Band that sounded like them. I would be very grateful, if you could tell some Bands, if you know any. 

Edit: Thanks to everyone for the replies!"

[You can give this a try.](http://www.last.fm/music/Korn/+similar) But I still think Flymore has the most similar sound to Korn."
"looking for a band similar to koRn ","Mudvayne and Coal Chamber are probably the closest to that sound. Others that are similar but a bit more under the radar are Flaw, Snot and 40 Below Summer."
"looking for a band similar to koRn ","I love snot but don't think they sound like korn. The other suggestions are solid, though."
"looking for a band similar to koRn ","Flaw is really nice, though it doesnt sound that similar to KoRn, it is this a very nice Band. Thanks!"
"looking for a band similar to koRn ","Adema or Ill Ni√±o. IIRC Adema was fronted by Jon Davis' half brother. "
"looking for a band similar to koRn ","Correct, Mark Chavez who was the previous lead vocalist of Adema is his half brother. Adema have a great sound and I would say it is very similar to Korn."
"looking for a band similar to koRn ","Adema sounds, from just listening to two songs, really nice and, as you said, very similar to KoRn. Thanks!"
"looking for a band similar to koRn ","Awesome!"

"Nonpoint - Back Up",""
"Nonpoint - Back Up","I think everything off this album is amazing. It was strange talking to some guys in a band called Haloscript (produced by Stereomud's and Clint Lowery's brother, Corey Lowery), they had no idea Nonpoint even made a second record. 

Nonpoint was the first live show I've ever been to in Ft Lauderdale, with Sevendust and Skindred on the bill. Best show I've ever seen in my life."

"Regarding Joey Jordison","Does anybody have any information on who will be replacing Joey Jordison in the recording of Slipknot's new album? or if he will be back in time to help with recording? Also does anyone have any information regarding a possible release date for the album?"
"Regarding Joey Jordison","I'm assuming that they are going to move clown over. I believe he was the original drummer before Joey got there.

I am interesting in finding out why he left though"
"Regarding Joey Jordison","Yeah that would make sense"
"Regarding Joey Jordison","Corey (I think it was Corey) said that as soon as they know who's gonna be drumming, we will know"
"Regarding Joey Jordison","Yeah I guess we just need to be patient"

"Flaw - Payback","I was a massive Flaw fan after this album came out. I would just play the album on repeat. They made a brilliant album together and then fell apart but it was inspiring to me at the time. Love it"

"Is it true that KoRn are the founding fathers of Nu Metal?","I've heard before that they're the reason the genre was created, that it was created since KoRn didn't fit into anything else.  How valid is this?"
"Is it true that KoRn are the founding fathers of Nu Metal?","It seems like this is generally the sentiment about Korn and the formation of ""nu-metal"". There were some bands that they definitely drew inspiration from (Primus, Faith No More, Ministry, Killing Joke) that preceded them. 

I guess it was the aggression they put behind their music that made them uncategorizable at the time.

"Is it true that KoRn are the founding fathers of Nu Metal?","Not the first nu-metal band but I think the first band to really popularize the genre. Like Nirvana was to grunge."

"Slipknot - 'Me Inside'","They kind of went away from there roots with All hope is gone. Not saying its a bad album but what got me a fan was Iowa, Left behind just blew me away. Then When I discovered MFKR, paul grays bass work just dumbfounded me."

"What is Nu-Metal to you?","Before I came to this Subreddit I thought I knew what Nu-Metal was and I really enjoyed that type of music. After subscribing here I saw a lot of bands posted that I never would have associated with the genre and after spending some time here I have no idea what Nu-Metal is anymore.  
Originally I came here because I really liked bands like:  
Korn, Slipknot, Static-X, etc.  
Some of the bands that really confused me on here were:  
Papa Roach, Drowning Pool, Deftones"
"What is Nu-Metal to you?","Hip hop influence. Low guitars. Rhythm, rarely solos. Its odd though, I love slipknot, korn, static, mudvayne and system but all of them sound completely different from the other. "
"What is Nu-Metal to you?","Mix of many different elements, very few guitar solos. Vocals can be very different, sometimes even in one song (like Zetsubou Billy by MTH for example).
You might see some unusual instruments (like bagpipes, flute, motograter).

Several popular bands have a few nu metal albums and some completely different (Papa Roach, Linkin Park...) so you shouldn't confuse those.

But I do think that some nu metal bands are very different from each other, but I still like most of them.

Also if you see a lot of dreadlocks, it's probably nu metal."
"What is Nu-Metal to you?","Nu Metal is Korn and anything influenced by them. Deftones were part of the movement in the 90's but began to fade away from the genre. Drowning Pool and Papa Roach had that low guitar rhytmic style in the early 2000's so you can classify them as nu metal."
"What is Nu-Metal to you?","Nu-metal for me: Heavy, mostly sung and not screamed, low quantity of guitar solos, contains rhythm (as in danceable, move your body to). Metal all you can do is headbang. That's my opinion at least."
"What is Nu-Metal to you?","At first, to me, Nu-Metal was a fusion of Rap and Rock. 

But, the more I think about it that isn't what Nu-Metal is at all given bands like Korn and Slipknot who don't do any rap really in their music. 

I guess the best way to describe it is ""Experimental rock."" Nu Metal bands always seemed to be finding ways to push the envelope in regards to what you hear in a typical metal song. Limp Bizkit brought Hiphop and Rock together, Korn brought Electronic music and Metal, Slipknot essentially did the same thing as Korn but had more metal and less electronica. 

Basically, what I think Nu-Metal is, is the incorporation of various musical elements into Metal. Nu-Metal bands assimilate various aspects of other genres to produce something that sounds different from other types of Metal.  

Now, whether or not what Nu-Metal does is any different than what other types of Metal do (incorporating other genres into their music) is up for debate. Maybe Nu-Metal is more extreme about what they take from other genres and that is what makes them unique.

When I think of Nu Metal, I think of songs like [Nookie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTMVOzPPtiw) by Limp Bizkit or [It's Goin' Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0nyy6AcfY4) by X-Ecutioners. 

Edit: In fact if you listen to It's Goin' Down it seems to describe what Nu-Metal is: 

&gt; The rhythm projects ""round the next sound


Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now


Detects the mesh of many elements compressed down


The melting pot of a super-futureesque style


The combination of vocal caress


With lungs the gasp for breath


From emotional stress


With special effects


And a distorted collage


Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage


It""s going down


The logical progression on the timeline


The seperation narrowed down to a fine line


To blur the edges so they blend together properly


Take you on an audible odyssey
"
"What is Nu-Metal to you?","Nu metal is emotional, raw, experimental, heavy  head banging/hip hopping material. It really is a beautiful thing isn't it? Its a shame most metalheads disregard nu metal as a one off fluke,  because its pretty damn awesome.

Edit: awesome whiteboy dreadlocks "

But they are progenitors of the genre, and their faces are plastered on the top of the subreddit; so, I figured some people might like to - at the very least - hear the track and judge it themselves. Have at it."
"Limp Bizkit's new single, ""Endless Slaughter"", is still streaming","Nu Metal isn't really Nu Metalish anymore. Look at LB, Deftones, Korn, LP, everyone really. All the major hitters have evolved into their own unique sound and the original ""Nu Metal sound"" has kinda been lost in that process. I personally think that's awesome."
"Fallen From Grace Performed by Band Nerds at Three Links 01/03/15",""
"Could someone explain this to me?","Limp Bizkit sounds more like rap than metal to me, I've listened to LInkin Park, Korn, Slipknot, and Dope, and I still don't understand how Limp Bizkit fits into the same subgenre."
"Could someone explain this to me?","Rap is a big part of nu metal."
"Could someone explain this to me?","Nu-Metal has a wide spectrum of sounds unlike many other sub-genres, which could one of the reasons its loved/hated so much. I know what your saying when bands like Korn and Slipknot sound nothing like Limp Bizkit. Your right,but, that again being said there very few new good new metal acts that sound the same. Except for the generic garbage bands that were looking to cash in on the sound. If you look at the big bands that survived the rise and fall, bands like Slipknot, Mudvayne, Korn, Deftones, they all have their own unique sounds besides some similarities on their first few albums. Then look at the other  good bands that may not have made it big but still make/made great music like Mushroomhead, American Head Charge, Snot, Nothingface, (hed) p.e, Nonpoint, Ill Nino, Soulfly They have an even wider variety of sounds and influences. Some blending punk, industrial, alternative, even traditional latino/spanish/native music into they're own unique sound. Then you have other band like Limp Bizkit, Bionic Jive, Stuck Mojo and again (hed) p.e who blend rap/hip hop into their sound and do it very well. I could also name Project Wyze, Primer 55 and The Union Underground but im not a fan, they're not that great, and they fell apart during the collapse of Nu-Metal. Im sure the ethnic background and environment have a great deal of effect on the sound of each band. (Hed) p.e, Bionic Jive and Stuck Mojo all hail from the west coast. Alot hip hop/rap comes from Cali. Limp Bizkit does seem odd hailing from Jacksonville Florida having a rap sound but than again an old interview with Fred Durst states that while recording their first album he was really into (hed) p.e's  1995 E.P Church of Realities with blended multiple sounds like punk,rap and even some jazz. Rap/hip hop makes up a big part of the Nu-metal sound. But than again so do so many other genres and sub-genres. Limp Bizkit has alot of metal in it just in different ways. Hope this helps..Sorry if I digressed."
"Could someone explain this to me?","Try listening to more Three Dollar Bill Y'All$. But I know what you mean, that's why some people prefer labeling Limp Bizkit as rapcore, not as n√º metal."

"What would you call this style of rock? Would this be considered numetal or something else?","Hard to say really, the line between rock/hard rock/nu metal is pretty blurred. I'd probably call it nu metal. Googling the band gave me industrial rock, which sounds pretty much like a different way of saying nu metal"

One of the best music purchases I've ever made. Listened to the CD until it was unplayable, bought another.

"Ultraspank - 5 Five","Absolutely love this band. Best song of the album right here. Progress is quite possibly the best nu metal album ever. "
"Ultraspank - 5 Five","Yeah, Progress is one of my favorite albums too."
"Ultraspank - 5 Five","Progress is the only album I go back to and listen after about a decade when I simply lost interest in rock music overall.  And I pretty much saw every act there was to see back in those days.  Truly a horrific thing for those guy's to be so under the radar when they clearly had tons of tracks that should have been at the top of the rock music charts. I think I blame Roadrunner for not putting in effort enough as far as marketing for them. 
However,  the band's members and their good characters brought them really close to their fans.  And from what  I remember,  they really cared about the community they played in.  And you could see Pete talking with the fans about personal issues and giving them advice they normally would not get at home or anywhere else.  So did the rest of the band.  I like to think of them as people that were from the future.  They understood the problems we were facing back then.  They were full of wisdom.  And am sure they still are. "
"Ultraspank - 5 Five","It was a mixture of absolutely zero promotion from their label (thanks RoadRunner) and being a day late and a dollar short on the nu-metal craze. Such a shame, this band was so far ahead of most, if not all, the mainstream bands at the time. Progress, along with a handful of other albums, are the ones I recommend to people who are brand new to nu-metal. In my opinion, Progress is the sound of nu metal at its finest, right along with American Head Charges album The War of Art. And Pete, along with 2 other Ultraspank members, are in a new band called Lo Pro. They're also phenomenal."

"Opinion on metalcore?","In my opinion most of it is the same, and I don't know if that's because it's become over-saturated, but even with the early and current bands I feel they have only 1 note in their arsenal of 'vocals' and a lot of the guitar work sounds the same and the songs are never really diverse.
ANYWAY what's your opinion?"
"Opinion on metalcore?","There are one or two deathcore bands that I like (don't really need any more than that because they all sound the same anyway) but aside from that I think metalcore is pretty much garbage. Vocals are always half whiny singing and half terrible screaming, nothing interesting being done with the guitars at all, and the drumming (especially in deathcore) is just a case of ""look how fast I can use my double kick!"" The bands have really lame names too"
"Opinion on metalcore?","same opinion, but this is not /r/circlejerk ..."
"Opinion on metalcore?","Metalcore can be really good, but most bands in the genre seem so alike to one another. To me it seems like every metalcore band uses the same formula and never dares to distinguish themselves in any way. 

But what I dislike the most about metalcore is the ridiculous try-hard, heavy sound they try to create, and I also can't stand how every metalcore band these days loves to overproduce their music so much that every drum beat feels like a needle poking your eardrum.

That being said, there are still some amazing metalcore releases out there. Waking The Fallen by Avenged Sevenfold is one of my all time favorite albums, and I also like Chimaira, and even early MCR."
"Opinion on metalcore?","Every Time I Die is the greatest band on the planet in any genre. "
"Opinion on metalcore?","Followed shortly by Norma Jean"
"Opinion on metalcore?","yup"
"Opinion on metalcore?","It really depends on the band and the vocals for me. If it sounds too whiny, then it isn't for me. "
"Opinion on metalcore?","It can be good. I'm a fan of Haste The Day and Atreyu. I also like Emmure, but they're deathcore."
"Opinion on metalcore?","i agree, my cousins really into metalcore and all these bands sound the same to me. And he knows they do, i tolled him ""man, i cant tell the difference between all these bands you just showed me"" and he said ""yeeaah... i know"" "
"Opinion on metalcore?","I personally enjoy metalcore and listen to it more than any other genre. But you're right, a lot of it tends to cling to a similar style and starts to get annoyingly repetitive after you hear the same elements over and over again in completely different bands.
Just like in any genre, though, you might have to do so e searching before you find something unique and enjoyable."
"Opinion on metalcore?","Atreyu, All That Remains, Bullet for my Valentine, early MCR,  and even Avenged Sevenfold are all examples of awesome metalcore bands. I think metalcore is more like numetal than anything. Both genres have a lot of crappy bands thrown in the mix which all have the same exact sound. But if you sift through all that, you can find some really good music."
"Opinion on metalcore?","The only good ones are the devil wears prada, a day to remember, and atreyu."

"I think it's fair these guys deserve more love.","i started listening to this band a few weeks ago and fell in love so bad! i like all the albums, even the non industrial ones (though i'm happy it was just a two album detour) I could go on forever talking about their songs!"
"I think it's fair these guys deserve more love.","Name your favourite tracks from ""tonight the stars revolt"" ""anyone for domesday"" ""somewhere on the other side of nowhere"" and ""builders of the future"". If you can't do it ;)"
"I think it's fair these guys deserve more love.","why leave ""true force"", ""mega kung fu radio"", ""transform"", ""korea"" ep, and ""destroy what you enjoy"" out? Well, I'd say that ""When worlds collide"" is killer and has some sexy vibe to it, ""blast off to nowhere"" is a pretty good collaboration with his brother rob.
From ""Anyone...?"" i'd like to point out ""the future that never was"", it's got all the feels and is unlike any other PM5K song.
From ""Somewhere..."" I'd have to say my preferences aren't so original, my favorite cuts are ""show me what you got"" and the sensuous ""supervillain""
As for ""builders ..."" i think ""how to be a human"" is just a strong as hell single and is simply oozing with decadent vitality. The title track also caught my attention above the rest.
That being said, I like all of their songs a lot and appreciate every album. From their covers album, I think they really nailed ""space oddity"", which is pretty tough, considering how good the original one is. I've heard some really lame pop covers of that song and they really didn't do it justice like spider one and co. did. 
Also, what do you think about their videos? I was kind of let down by ""how to be a human""'s video after all the crazy sci fi the previous ones had. I understand the label won't give them a ton of money for it like before, as the industry isn't was it was back then and the band isn't as popular, but I think they at least could've put some live footage in between and some takes other than just the band playing locked up in a room.
"
"I think it's fair these guys deserve more love.","For me it's be the future that never was as well, evil world from their newest, and get your bones in my opinion is the best track of off somewhere. I never got into mega Kung fo unfortunately, just wasn't my thing. For transform id have to say song about nuthin or free. It's really hard to pick favourite off of albums because one day I'm really enjoying one song and then another day it's something else. I really like devil inside on copies and clones. Space oddity is probably my favourite as well. As far as ttsr I think id have to pick either super nova goes pop or good times roll. Also about the whole video thing, I mean the video for free isn't anything crazy, or action. Spider looks like he's having fun as per usual, I will agree the video isn't anything like bombshell but I feel like it captures the heavier feel of electronics that were present in this album and kind mixes that in with their style in this video, at least that's the vibe I get from it. Sorry it took me awhile to reply btw, keep saying i should and then forget. 

Edit: on my phone so I didn't really feel like making paragraphs or any of that, sorry about the rough writing. "
"I think it's fair these guys deserve more love.","Oh, never mind about the delay, I took quite a while myself. 

Picking up on ""Builders..."" having a heavier electronic side as you mentioned, I have been thinking that maybe it is because Spider is now completely in control of the band's direction. Though I like the new album as much as the older ones, this makes me think that maybe we'll never get to hear the potential of the new bass and guitar players. I thought that in this last record the guitar was a little behind in the mix for my taste, though not always, of course. Not that I oppose the full-on electronic moments that some songs, like the title track, have. What do you think about their show openers this tour? I really wasn't too big into Wolfborne, but American Head Charge gets me roking with their more agressive songs. About the new pair (knee high fox and hed pe), i don't dig Knee high Fox too much, but i could still listen them for a short while without feeling bothered. Hed pe is in my opinion the best of the bunch and a terrific opener. If PM5K ever came to South America, it would be cool if those guys opened.

Oh, and Wayne Static's passing was pretty damn sad. I felt it mandatory to point out. Both Wayne's work with Static-X and his solo record were very good, and I had become increasingly attached to them this last few weeks. Too bad I could never see him live, he put up one hell of a show."
"I think it's fair these guys deserve more love.","I've never seen pm5k live and I would absolutely love to, I live in Canada so it's just as unlikely for them to come up here. I'm not a huge fan of watching shows live on YouTube personally, it never does them much justice and is hard to find decent quality ones; so as far as any of their openers go I couldn't tell you a thing on my personal opinion. Now static x was a band I was for sure starting to get into, they're good, but like most bands I can't seem to enjoy all of their music, or even that much of, I found they were quite good in small bursts, as to where I could like to pm5k for hours non stop. Since were on the topic of nu-metal, how do you feel about slip knot? Personally can't stand them. I think they're absolutely horrible, I like the lead singers side project stone sour 20x better then slip knot. Another nu-metal band that I love is korn, as unfortunate it as it is, I find they haven't been able to quite stand the test of time as well as pm5k has, in my opinion of course. I loved untouchables and it's easily my favourite album by korn, shortly followed by issues and then self titled. If you have high or decent quality headphone(100$+) I recommend giving the untouchables album a good listen... It brings a new level to korn most people don't even notice. Lots of little things you'd miss in your car. One more band I would recommend listening to, and all though they aren't nu-metal would type o negative. If you like weirder, music that to most people go ""not bad..."" At first glance then they're that type of band. The more listen it seems the better they get. Much like tool and qotsa. "
"I think it's fair these guys deserve more love.","Hmm... I actually do like slipknot, but I don't really listen to them that often. I know that the comparison with mushroomhead is pretty stupid and that it's a rivarly that should've never existed, but I like mushroomhead a lot better and i think they look cooler (as in having a better thought up aesthetic). I'm not too big into koRn, i used to listen to them when i was younger though. I liked ad.i.d.a.s. a lot, and a while ago i watched the video for ""blind"" and found the song pretty cool. The thing with them is that i don't like their sentimental songs. It's not that i have anything against heavy bands having sentimental songs, but i don't happen to like korn's too much. Still, I'll give their discography a deeper revision, especially Untouchables.

On the subject of headphones, oh yes, music is a hell of a lot better with good ones. Mine aren't too fancy, but at least they're not cheap earbuds or overpriced fashion items. The experience of listening to something good straight from the original CD or a FLAC file with good headphones is always great, and lets you discover all the little details of the production (especially with industrial or industrial influenced albums), i sure love it.

Type o negative is great!  I would recommend [9electric](http://www.9electric.com/media/music/), they've got a pretty good industrial sound and have a collaboration with Wayne static. Do you like industrial bands that rely almost purely on the electronics? I get a good kick out of listening to Skinny puppy and Laibach.

QOTSA are pretty damn good. I've actually been avoiding them for a while because I'm still gloomy over not having been able to see them when they came over a few weeks ago (I had to choose between that and a festival that included Deep Purple, at least I enojoyed Deep purple thoroughly, they put a spectacular performance).

There's a couple of professionally recorded PM5K performances on youtube, you could look them up, if at least to hear a different take on some of their songs. I agree on most amateur videos of bands not being so enjoyable, I checked this tour's openers via their studio material. Too bad PM5K hasn't released a live album, they're tight enough performers to deliver a solid hitting one. There's a decent amount of live PM5K on ""the good, the bad, and the ugly, vol. 1"" but that covers their rap era only. Then there's the live version of When world collide that came as an extra with some copies of Destroy that you Enjoy, but just that.

Back to nu-metal, what do you think about Dope? I checked them because Tripp Eisen (the sexual-assault-guilty guy from Static-x) played with them. I found them to be quite my cup of tea. A smaller band I stumbled upon by coincidence is Motograter. The custom instrument they took their band name from gives them a terrific sound in my opinion.

Oh, and just not to leave some big names out of the discussion, what are your thoughts on Nine inch nails, marilyn manson and rammstein?

"
"I think it's fair these guys deserve more love.","See for me dope... Is pretty boring, I liked one album and it was a pretty solid album, their first one I think?(one with ""spine for me"") and the rest was just to much screaming. I think that's why I'm rather weary when it comes to nu-metal. Some of it's awesome and some is horrible. Hearing that from a korn fan must be weird, but I think that's why I can't get into slip knot, or lamb of god, or dope, or even pantera for that matter. There's just too much screaming. I find a scream really accents a song when it's used properly and not to often.

Unfortunately I didn't hear you touch on the subject of tool... Which makes me a sad character ahaha as they are my favourite band. As far as NIN goes, I really enjoy them, an yet I still have to be in the mood to listen to them, I saw them along with sound garden live this year and I can't decide which was better, but I might have to go with Chris Cornell on this one, he voice out performs Trent reznor everyday. (I'm pretty opinionated on certain things, but still love to hear other peoples opinions and am willing to re look at things). As far as Marilyn Manson goes, they've got some really damn good stuff, and I enjoy a lot of their music, and as cool as their remix's are, I feel like it's too much sometimes. 

I don't need how you feel about more metal like rather than nu-metal, but you should give iced earth a listen if you enjoy Metallica. They're a smaller band, not known very well, and yet I really really enjoy their music. Ashes of ares isn't to bad either, their newer and I bough one of their albums, kinda cool to listen to just to throw another name in there. 

Now I'm gonna throw some random bands names, all from different styles and I'm curious your take on them(I like all the bands I'm about to mention) 
-rage against the machine
-red hot chili peppers 
-rush
-the offspring
-ministry 
-limp bizkit(yes they're fucking awesome)
-Isis(really really solid instrumental, lacking vocals)
-godsmack
-Alice in chains
-alien ant farm
-Chevelle(very hit and miss for me)
And I'll end with billy talent.(probably one of top favourite bands)"
"I think it's fair these guys deserve more love.","iced earth is pretty solid, i haven't listened to them all that much, but hell do I respect them.

I didn't know about ashes of ares, but as soon as i searched for them on youtube and found their stuff on the nuclear blast records channel, i knew i was about to listen to some ass kicking material. Thanks for that one, it's killer.

Rage against the machine is by now a classic, i love their stuff. I also like Red Hot Chili Peppers a lot, though as hipster as it sounds, i resent a lot the fact that they've become so massively popular, there's just a lot of jerks that have jumped the RHCP bandwagon. Not that I like them any less, I actually own Blood sugar sex magik and One hot minute on cassette tape. I like their first album best though.

Rush is great, again, a classic. Not one of my personal favourites, but still always impressive and a pleasure to listen to at all times.

Ministry is unbeatable. I hadn't listened to them that much til this year (I started to get more into industrial this last few months, that's when i got into powerman 5000). They're powerful on every level. I'm planning to get some part time job during the summer so I can save to see them live (they're coming to my town in march! talk about cool!)

I had always dismissed the offspring and instead listened to more classic or harder punk, but giving them a listen, they're actually good in their own way.

Limp bizkit i really dislike, though there are other rap-rock and rap-metal acts that i enjoy, like early powerman 5000 and Motown Rage.

Alice in chains and godsmack I find pretty damn good. Two big thumbs up for those, superb music.

I had read a bit about Alien ant farm because Terry Corso had played with them before (and after) being a member of Powerman 5000. I just listened to one of their songs and it sounds very promising. Nice stuff, gonna make them room in my grooveshark playlists.

I knew that isis was a metal band with a solid reputation, but hadn't given them a listen. I just tried them and they sound great, right up with what i had read about them.

I only knew Chevelle and Billy Talent by name before checking them right now. Chevelle sounds great from what I've just heard, good rythm. The same for billy talent, i got a pleasant surpirse from checking their stuff.

Further discussing more bands, what do you think of Coal Chamber? They are one of my favorite nu metal bands, and the video for ""Loco"" is one of my favorite music videos. And what about Soil? Though their sound isn't so innovative, i feel that they pull it a lot more real than other successful bands, and that their angry and/or emotional moments sound pretty honest. 

Back to tool, i think they're very good, but not my taste too much. I don't like the singer and their complexity alienates me somewhat, not for the complexity itself, but it doesn't appeal too much to me in the way that it is. I do like stuff like King Crimson, Yes, Buckethead and Steve vai, which are also complex in their own ways.

What about primus? I love them to the bone, and had the chance to see them for the first time at a music festival this weekend. Their set was short but manic, the crowd went nuts.

A topic I've got to touch, if at least as a side remark, is glam/sleaze metal. I'm a huge glam metal nut both for the music and the looks. I hallucinate with stuff like motley crue, tuff, ratt, warrant, poison, and so on. Most metalheads dislike it, so i wouldn't be the least offended if you did too, but i wondered what you'd think.

As a last thing i'd like to make a personal recommendation, [2X.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFdSrIRgvDI)
It's kind of corny to recommend a band just because it's from my country, but hey, they're pretty good and have a lot of respect in the local scene, and, well, all the more chances you haven't heard of them.

Sorry if it came out too long, hehe; and for the delay, this last two weeks were pretty busy at the university, being the last two ones before the summer break, exams and all that jazz.

regards"
"I think it's fair these guys deserve more love.","I tried clicking that 2x link time and time again and just got nothing, I'm on mobile so it seems impossible to touch, maybe a song along with it so I can search it up on YouTube?

Also I gave coal chamber a listen, and they're just not my style, unfortunately I'm kind of odd when it comes to music. I much more enjoy the technical side of things, and songs with more.. Emotion. Wether that be down on yourself, expressing the way you see the world etc. Even while listening to pm5k not all of their songs have some sort of deep meaning behind it, but in general a lot of songs give you a general vibe and the message their trying to get across. Like I said earlier, I believe screaming can be amazing if used well and not to often, that and their lead singer just was kind of generic. 

I don't mean to be an asshole when I talk about music either it's just something I spend a lot of time with, I'm listening to my music at work, at home, on the weekend. So I've become kind of hard to break out of my comfortable shell. I enjoy what kind of music I have and what I listen to, it's hard for me to get behind a new band. There's lots of times where I've given some honest chances and just can't do it.

Back to montley Cr√ºe and etc. I don't mind that kind of stuff to be honest. It's nice every once in awhile, I wouldn't consider myself just a metal head though either. I enjoy all types of music(besides country, country sucks) I'll listen to rap every once in awhile and still enjoy me some relapse or good kid MAAD city. Also well done electronic music isn't bad on the odd chance either. So I'm decently open to music. I find as much as I do enjoy metal, some if it's really damn good, or absolutely horrible, I enjoy bands that are a little weird, stick out.  

I get side tracked a lot and talk to much ahah sorry about that. Anyways poison is cool, def leppard use to be my favourite band when I was younger and I still enjoy that music. 

As far as primus goes, ya they're not bad, kind of cool, just a band that never quite did it for I suppose. 

I know you weren't big into tool, and you don't like the lead singer. Now do you not like his vocals? Or because he can be a dick? Because if it's because he can be a dick I think you should give ""v for vagina"" by puscifer a listen, it's a weird sound, and personally my favourite album by them. 

I think I touched on everything? I'm not sure I could talk about music for days. 

Big sugar is from my country and I think you should give them a listen, they're pretty damn good, and ""all hell for a basement"" has a pretty good meaning behind it, if you understood anyways, still and awesome song. 

How do you feel about xzibit? Not to sure what your stance on rap is, but IMO he's probably the most under appreciated artist out there. 

One last thing before I polish things up! I my favourite steams from bands like , tool, type o negative, powerman 5000, Alice in chains, and QOTSA(not in order) but if you have any music that kind of sounds somewhere around any of that stuff I'm always open for a listen! Also kyuss I kinda cool.  "
"I think it's fair these guys deserve more love.","Never mind about not liking Coal Chamber or whataver, man. You haven't sounded like an asshole at all during the conversation. 

On Xzibit... I think he's pretty good at what he does, though I'm not too much intro his style of music. I generally don't dig the gangsta cliches too much and don't think too much of gangsta rap in general, but the big names like Xzibit that actually put something solid with clever lyrics here and there to help build up the whole thing do have my respect. I just listened to some of his songs, and they're quite enjoyable. I can also listen to snoop dogg and ice cube from time to time and get a kick out of it, though usually it's because I'm with friends who are into that music.

2X has a strong rap element to it, or at least an influence on some of their less rap-ish songs. If the link didn't work, I'd recommend ""Abuso de poder"", ""No vamos a ceder"", and ""Al choke"". 

Out of all the stuff you've shown me that I hadn't listened to, Big Sugar has to be my favourite. The lead singer's voice really stands out, and the guitars are dirty in the best way. I don't know much about drumming, but I do like the way the drummer carries the whole thing. Good lyrics, too.

On Maynard James Keenan, well, him being a dick does alienate me a lot. I know one isn't supposed to listen or not listen to something just because of the way one of the members of a band behaves, but to me the case is too strong. On the other hand, I tend to defend my favourite rockstars til the bitter end when I'm a lot into their music. Tool's music itself has something that doesn't get to me, it strikes me as pretentious, like just being the overthought fruit of the band's work. Well, to be fair, most of the times someone dislikes music that is very elaborate, it feels pretentious, like the countless times any famous progressive band has been called pretentious. I listened to some Pussifer, and I have to say it's really well done music that I probably only understand on the most shallow level, but still didn't get to me.

About well done electronic music, what do you think about Kraftwerk? I'm not that knowledgeable on electronic, and have mostly been getting into it this year. I still hate mainstream IDM with all my guts.
I know it's kind of a lazy and noobish way to start looking, but i began listening to the ""artificial intelligence"" compilations by Warp records. I'd recommend anything by that label. Aphex Twin, Black Dog Productions, Speedy J have all stuck with me.

Oh, and really experimental electronics like Mouse on Mars' i also can listen to without ever getting tired. 

What's your take on dubstep? I dislike mainstream dubstep a lot, and there's a lot of ""dubstep for connoisseurs"" that I also feel is just random noise without any effort or feeling behind it. With time I've found some stuff that actually sound clever and with real intention behind it, specially Bassnectar. That guy has remixed several metal/rock songs, I got acquainted with his work after one of his remixes appeared on an official repressing of a Primus album. I do like dubstep remixes of metal songs in general, and bands that incorporate dubstep by their own on their work. Of course, I still think that many of the remixes out there are a bonehead mess. 

I felt like bringing out the dubstep thing because of Korn and their inclussion of it on some of their most recent work. I've come to really like that mixture, I think they pulled it off really well. What I don't like is some of the pop elements they've brought to their songs, like the hook in ""never never"". The beginning with the electronic sounds is quirky great, I like the breakdown, but the pop hook just feels like a flat slap. As you may have guessed, I've been listening to Korn here and there since we began these messages. My take on them is that while I'm super into their aggro stuff like Faget, Blind, Shoots and Ladders, A.d.i.d.a.s, etc. some of their poppped down newer stuff feels awkward. Getting current on the subject, what do you think of Hater? I don't know if it contradicts what I was talking about, but I liked it. I couldn't take the testimonies in the video all that serious, because they were a bit of a caricature of the 00's outcast Korn fan kids, but in the end I felt they worked in a weird pop culture way. The rest of the video  I found very very cool and cathartic.

I've liked the Korn videos i've seen. Both the simpler ones like Shoots &amp; Ladder's and Blind's, which work mostly on clever shots of the band's raw energy, and the full-on cgi ones, like Never Never's and Love and Meth's. Thoughtless' video, that featured a high school outcast that vomited in his prom... that one was awkward. But all of the others i love.  Oh, and Spike in my veins' video is cool, even when it points at a critique that is kinda commonly said, the video is tight. 

And Freak on a leash's! That sweet 90s animation, it reminds me of so many good 90s cartoons. No to say the clever video itself, and the whole bullet effect. 

Sorry if I got too sidetracked on the videos thing &gt;.&lt; I'm going to start studying to work with movies, tv, and documentaries next year, so I always have an eye on them and like discussing the subject.

On the last bands you mentioned... well, I think I've covered them all, except maybe Alice in chains. I think they're masters at what they do, last night I listened to their first album. I still have to get into what they've done with their new singer, though.

Seeing that you like both rap and some rap-rock bands, I'm curious about why you're not that attracted to Powerman 5000's rap records. I myself enjoy them thoroughly, and savor them as a chance to listen to turntables and congas along with Spider One's voice, which probably won't happen again, as much as I think the turntables would fit right in, and that the congas would be cool in chill songs like I wanna kill You.

So I think that's about it. Sorry for taking so long again, and, um, merry christmas"
"I think it's fair these guys deserve more love.","As far as korn goes I really only enjoy everything they've put out right up until LIP I honestly can't stand their new stuff, doesn't feel like korn. I enjoyed hater though, not a bad song all around and probably the only song I fully enjoy of their dubstep album would be sanctuary. Untouchables is still my favourite album by far, with good quality headphones they have so much wonky sound effects and such going on in the background you usually just miss. As far as their videos I enjoy pretty much all of them, it just always looks like their havin fun and doing them. 

As for powerman 5000s rap-rock style. I feel like it's just... I'm not sure, extremely awkward, they hadn't quite found their sound yet, and while it is cool, it also sounds pretty brutual imo. Not good as far as rap goes and as far as rock goes it's pretty sour as well. I'd much rather listen to ratm and I'm not even a huge ratm fan. I've tried to listen to it and no matter how many times I listen to it, it just doesn't sound good to me. I can barely sit through a whole song.

I recently got into a few new bands including ""the tea party"" which they are pretty awesome. As well as ""the raconteurs"". Both really solid bands and really really enjoyable music. 

I'm giving 2X a listen right now and I'll let you know what I think.

There's a local band in my area that's just recent starting, my buddy is the lead singer and naturally I think their pretty damn good. They sound like qotsa on heroin. It's really good their name is ""the dead Fibers"" I'm not to sure how much of it is available on YouTube. But for sure worth a listen. 

And ya merry ho ho Jesus to you! (That's merry Christmas) 

Edit:I mean take a look in the mirror not LIP"
"I think it's fair these guys deserve more love.","First time I've listened to them since ""Tonight the stars Revolt!"".  I'll admit I don't mind the song, but I'm not going to go out of my way to listen to more of them.

Thanks for bringing them back to my attention though."

"Bracket Day 4: David Draiman (2) V.S. Wayne Static (3)","David Draiman is the lead singer of Disturbed and most recently Device. He is widely recognized by fans and non-fans alike due to his unique animal growls that he often includes in songs. Although Disturbed is sometimes recognized as more of a hard rock band than Numetal, there is no denying the greatness of The Sickness.

Wayne Static is the lead singer for the band Static-X. Although Static X was popular in Numetal in the early 2000's there popularity faded over time and this unfortunately led to a break up of the band in recent years. However, not before they released a stream of popular hits.

If you remember, [minus] then changed their name to Minus.Driver and record a new EP in 2003 called ""A Message for You""....EP was more melodic but still cool. Seems like I just found another reason to post a new stuff on /r/numetal;)

"What makes Numetal that genre?","Hey guys. System of a down is one of my favorite bands of all time. I was young when they were around and i wasnt intirested in what genre of music they classify so i never questioned it. So i come accross this genre somewhere... anyways what im asking everyone is what components of music allow you to qualify for the numetal genre?"
"What makes Numetal that genre?","I always felt like NuMetal was a bullshit term in the first place, as many bands considered NuMetal have little to nothing in common, for this i site Motograter and Lostprophets.  The misspelling and umlauts are probably what causes most people to not take it seriously at a glance, but really it comes down to personal preference, one person may be into Linkin Park and Dry Cell and just cant get into the heavier side, others may be into the more rap influenced stuff like Crazytown,there was punkier stuff like Lostprophets, and yet others like System and Kittie and gravitate towards the heavier side.  For me, personally, System was always a little out there into Prog Rock than i liked then, and lyrical content has kept me away as i got older.  But im willing to wager if you went through my cd collection back in the day you would seriously question my sanity on some of my selections, but it was all personal preference.

NuMetal is just a hard genre to pin down.  I have seen bands on this sub that ive argued heavily in the past dont fit, but now that im older i know how broad and indistinct NuMetal was.  It was just a name to call the music of the day, because unlike Grunge, Hair Metal, and original Heavy Metal, there were very few unifying factors between the acts, nothing to define them as one and the same.  "
"What makes Numetal that genre?","i really appreciate the feedback. i completely agree with you on most of what you said. although im not a true numetal fan, it is an important part of music as i grew up hearing crazytown, linkin park, lost prophets, etc. now that i know what kind of music i use to listen to, now i can rediscover the music :D"
"What makes Numetal that genre?","My personal favorite bands are Dope and Sevendust, both bands that started out lumped in with NuMetal and made healthy transitions beyond that... theres actually alot of good stuff out there, and the genre isnt truly dead yet, it lives in bands like Nine Lashes and Super Bob"
"What makes Numetal that genre?","Yeah, all the rap-metal gets thrown into nu-metal, and I hate rap-metal (Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit), but like other bands categorized as nu-metal:  Sevendust and Deftones.  No idea why Sevendust gets categorized in here - they're just straight heavy-ass rock/metal.  Just some heavy guitars and great melodies."
"What makes Numetal that genre?","normally, NuMetal is seen as a fusion of hip-hop and hard rock, so technically bands like Linkin Park(before they sold their souls to pop music), Limp Bizkit, Rage Against The Machine, and CrazyTown were the truest embodiments of the genre, even though the term really started with Korn, Incubus, Sevendust, Deftones, and System of a Down, and to some extent early 311, all bands that i would argue never really fit the defnition to begin with.  Then you had great bands like The Union Underground that got swept up in the flood of bands that tried to sound like everyone else, instead of sounding like themselves and happenning to produce that sound."
"What makes Numetal that genre?","Man, such a great description. Clearly I'm late to this thread but was searching to see what I'd find on here in the NuMetal world. Some of my favorite bands are Sevendust and Nonpoint, with similar sounding (more mature) rock bleeding out these days. Though, Sevendust has evolved quite nicely. 

I'm trying to think of how I got here from where I started. My first two albums I owned were Alanis - Jagged Little Pill and Savage Garden's first record. Alternative rock and digital pop. Then I saw a music video for Garbage - Push It and was sold. I was sort of a sheltered kid, in terms of not knowing much about the outside world, and watching that video and even listening to that record made me feel like I shouldn't be listening to it. It felt wrong, but so good. Then I got into Limp Bizkit, Alien Ant Farm, and Linkin Park. 

I know that was long but I really wanted to share. It's tough when people ask me what I listen to, and it's really hard to explain that I like these bands still.  Check out Candlelight Red, Nothing More, Dead Letter Circus, and Daybreak Embrace. Currently spinning those :)"
"What makes Numetal that genre?","&gt;Nu metal (also known as n√º-metal or aggro-metal) is a subgenre of heavy metal music. It is a fusion genre which combines sounds, influences and characteristics of heavy metal and its subgenres such as groove metal, thrash metal and alternative metal with other genres, including hip hop and grunge. It is classed as part of alternative metal. Notable nu metal bands include Korn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Deftones, Disturbed, and Slipknot.

&gt;^^^http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_metal"
"What makes Numetal that genre?","so alternative metal... but heavier? or softer? or with more hip-hopish drums? see this reply really does nothing for me.

 i feel like slipknot is definitely metalcore. in fact i think slipknot was the reason metalcore even became a genre. but that's just my opinion.

 so i move to the others on the list... korn and limp bizkit. two extremley different styles to me. linkin park and deftones really have that style in common when u slice out the hip-hop influence. 

my point still stands i cant seem to decipher what proper numetal is. "
"What makes Numetal that genre?","I can assure you, [Slipknot](https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/slipknot) have nothing to do with Metalcore.

[Metalcore](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/metalcore) started in 1990 with Rorschach - [Remain Sedate](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/rorschach/remain_sedate/), and the [Metalcore we know today](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Melodic+Metalcore/) started in 1996 with Shadows Fall - [Mourning a Dead World](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/shadows_fall/mourning_a_dead_world/). "
"What makes Numetal that genre?","Yeah, Slipknot started grouped in with NuMetal but quickly tore themselves out of the genre... nowadays i wouldnt know what to call them other than plain and simple Metal, as they tend to be a nice blending of all different breeds of metal, save for maybe Symphonic stuff"

"In Defense of Nu-Metal - MetalSucks","Good post OP, made me happy on the inside. There are so many blaring double standards toward Nu Metal that so many good bands have been swept under the rug completely. And honestly, I think the comeback that its making is much more welcome this time around. Look at My Ticket Home's new album for example. It's like Nu Metal 2.0 without all the over production, plus it was well received. There is hope, the direction Nu Metal is headed is actually pretty bright."

"Bracket Day 8: Chino Moreno (2) V.S. Sully Erna (3)","Chino Moreno is the lead front man of the Deftones. His music often contains a eerie hypnotic tone that draws the listener in. The Deftones and Chino are often praised for there unique style and many people do not wish to admit that the Deftones are Numetal.

Sully Erna is the lead singer of Godsmack. Godsmack was formed in the late 90's and has grown to be one of the biggest Numetal and hard rock bands of current time. Sully is well liked for his impactful stage presence during live shows such as the bands live drum battles.

I love these guys. I found them by searching for some other bands tracks back in 2000 (thanks Napster) and stumbled across all the tracks from Strait Up and of course Absent, which remains one of my favorite tunes by them. I was 13 at the time and this felt like the perfect mix of aggressive and manic vocals I could identify with. I don't think I have or ever will hear another band quite like this. RIP Lynn."

"Nu metal fans...","Fellow subredditors, I'm here to pick your brains a little for research project I'm doing on the Nu metal culture, if anyone would like to chime in on this thread, if could be helpful to me. 
Here's a question I'm going to start off with to hopefully spark a conversation...
When you think of the Nu metal culture, how would you describe the fans? And why is there such distaste for Nu metal in general from other parts of the rock/metal scene?"
"Nu metal fans...","At the time, it was just out there compared to most metal/rock out there. It mixed genres and sounds in a way that resonated with people. And the lyrics! Such dark lyrics, particularly from bands like Korn, Staind, and Deftones at the time the wave really hit...My experience with the genre as a fan is that you embrace the darkness, awkwardness, quirkiness, disillusionment, loneliness, and/or etc. that you feel as a teenager (although it wasn't all dark, I'd say generally the sound and/or lyrics tended to be dark for this genre).  I was born in 94, so most of this stuff I caught unto in the new millennium, and I carry that music and support most those bands to this day. A lot of music after nu metal was and kind of still is heavily influenced by it. Sorry if I'm just rambling here but that's what I think of when I think of nu metal ( and post-grunge frankly, though another genre I'd argue some of that got mixed in there with nu metal). I think of the basic guidelines rock/metal has to follow for me to even like it most of the time.

Why people didn't like nu metal? Limp Biscuit. Maybe some impersonators surrounding them too...Its funny cuz I love early LB, screw everyone else who always hated them. But maybe that's because I'm a little of a hip-hop fan too so the hybridization was fantastic for me when I was first discovering their stuff in high school. But yeah, everyone hated them and they seemed to become poster boys for the crappy nu metal scene. Korn was the largest contributor to nu metal along with LB but I think people liked Korn way more. They were more creative I think. 
I'm no expert, I was a decade late, always thought it'd have been better if I was born in 84 instead :)"
"Nu metal fans...","I still like Limp Bizkit, can't wait for their new album. "
"Nu metal fans...","There are dozens of us!"
"Nu metal fans...","Yea LB ruined Nu Metal. Also post-grunge bands did get lumped into the genre. The biggest problem with trying to explain Nu Metal for me is actually what is Nu Metal defined as? I actually had someone (doesn't listen to Rock music at all, only big bands and in general 30's and 40's music, my grandmother) though Insane Clown Posse was in Nu Metal. I was appalled to say the least. But when i listen to some stuff from them or other acts of the same area, I can see it. I mean when you look at wikipedia's list for Nu Metal (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nu_metal_bands) the bands are all over the place in styles. Machine Head just above Marilyn Manson?  Kid Rock, Creed, Incubus, Vanilla Ice (lol), Sum 41, are all on this list. I think we can agree at least some of these bands are definitely not Nu Metal. "
"Nu metal fans...","I think the technical definition is when you combine metal/hard rock with another style I.e korns flutter with Dubstep very nu metal but I can't really see sum 41 as nu metal... "
"Nu metal fans...","Yea, decided to look it up on wiki. This is what was said,""Nu metal (also known as n√º-metal or aggro-metal ) is a subgenre of heavy metal which combines metal music with hip hop, hardcore punk and grunge. It is classed as part of alternative metal.""  It is still very broad in terms of what it covers. "
"Nu metal fans...","That wikipedia list was one of the first things i resorted to, just to get a glimpse of what everyone (since of course, wikipedia is something that anything and their pets can edit and revise) thought of what really was considered nu metal or not, and it really got me scratching my head at a few, including Vanilla Ice and especially Alien Ant Farm (who i'm a big fan of)."
"Nu metal fans...","Yea wiki is not good for things. But as for the list, you can check multiple places and get completely different lists for Nu Metal. It's really wonky."
"Nu metal fans...","&gt; including Vanilla Ice

Vanilla Ice did a nu metal album.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-LNT1r6GRA"
"Nu metal fans...","tbh you can say that all those bands had at least a few songs which were nu-metal in style. As for vanilla ice, he released an (really shitty) album of songs in the style, to cash in later in his career. "
"Nu metal fans...","Oh wow Vanilla ice had a career? I see the whole few songs aspect but a few songs does not put a band into a genre. How would you feel if Nickleback did a Thrash song and then all of a sudden they are considered Metal?"
"Nu metal fans...","lol yeah he kept trying to rebrand himself to fit into whatever seemed popular at the time, it was entirely awful. No idea who was paying for all the albums he brought out!

Tbh if you're going to go by wikipedia for the most accurate in genre labels then you're gonna have a bad time :p though I suppose it's accurate to say that they were all popular at around the same time as nu-metal and were probably bought by a lot of the same fans. hah I would love to hear Nickleback try to do thrash, that would be hilarious ^_^"
"Nu metal fans...","I consider all of those bands nu metal. Sure, some are better than others, but all put out distinctly nu metal sounds at least at some point in their careers. "
"Nu metal fans...","Wow... You are really a lot like me, in the thinking part, and point of view on the whole Nu-metal scene. And I'm also from '94

... Are you my long lost twin?"
"Nu metal fans...","I would describe nu metal fans as fans of music that aren't just traditional riffs/lyrics. when I think nu metal I think korn soad ratm and slipknot. They all had unique styles that weren't traditional to the normal metal/ rock fans"
"Nu metal fans...","RATM is considered Nu Metal? Didn't think about that. I whole-heartedly agree with the unique styles comment, most of the bands of the mid 2000's sounded alike (I'm looking at you 30 seconds to mars, Fall out boy, MCR, Panic at the disco), this is also true for the newer stuff that I keep hearing on the radio. "
"Nu metal fans...","Omfg just fuck those bands you listed. Ratm talked about political angst and tom morello on the guitar really just bright a style that wasn't just rap/rock but gave it a metal edge"
"Nu metal fans...","YES! FUCK THOSE BANDS! But is my statement true about them sounding all alike? Also RATM's Tom Morello and Serj Tankian of SOAD got together for a political campaign called the Axis of Justice, they want to get rid of the Electoral College. Really quite interesting if you are into politics. 

edit: more material"
"Nu metal fans...","They all sounded the same just commercialized poprock
Yea if only we didn't have the electoral college"
"Nu metal fans...","Yep, well Princeton actually did a study of the U.S. and found we are actually not a democracy anymore. We are actually an Oligarchy, or a country run by an elite class. Man I love being a Political Science major."
"Nu metal fans...","Elitist with money... lets not forget the money aspect"
"Nu metal fans...","The word ""elitist"" is synonymous with ""rich."" That's why they ARE elite."
"Nu metal fans...","Elitists are just people who believe a society should be dominated by a few. There is more than one way to rule a people because you believe you're superior "
"Nu metal fans...","That study is bullshit, in my opinion. The took factors of people who have the most ""influence"" in our country's fate. That is because the ""elite"" who are ""controlling"" this country are the ones with the most to lose if certain legislation is passed. The average citizen doesn't give a shit about most legislation as it only affects corporations or special interest groups. These ""elitists"" are the ones who take the time to sit down and view each candidate as potential voters in future committee polls. If a district in PA is voting on a new Rep for the House and the old one was pro-labor rights, but anti-gun, the NRA will push to have this person removed while Steel Workers Union will push for them to stay in office. The same thing works for business owners. Once in office, the corporations/special interest groups are legally able to pay money to lobbyists to help fund a candidate in exchange for voting rights. We all could do THE SAME THING if we banded together, but we don't because we don't CARE. That's what annoys me. It's not that we are an Oligarchy, it's that the majority of this Democracy just doesn't give a shit."
"Nu metal fans...","Yep, well said. But that is the beginning of the Oligarchy. I think the biggest problem in this country is that too many people ""know"" issues and they have an opinion on the issue with no more proof than that they guy on Fox News, MSNBC, or CNN said it. There are no individual beliefs in the majority of the country. Also as a result, our elections are not who is the most qualified but the most popular. Another problem with the government set up we currently have is that the faceless politicians in D.C. seem not to care about their constituents and if these constituents stand up against the current standard, they are labelled terrorists or the like. Some of this is because the one bad apple ruins the basket in most cases, but also this has something to do with the media in general. There are too many blind sheep in the heard, and it will be the end of things in the long run. It may not be mine or my children's generation but it will happen."
"Nu metal fans...","The only distaste I see towars nu metal is on the internet. I have not experienced any hate or anything between nu metal and other metal fans. And I think it's because there is no real seperated fan group for nu metal, at least where I live.  

I go to concerts almost once a month and go to Wacken every year and never have I ever watched someone getting shit on for wearing/hearing nu metal bands by ""true metalers"" or vice versa."
"Nu metal fans...","Are you in Europe? Things are a bit different for me in the Detroit, Michigan area. I almost got beat down in a mosh at a Slayer concert for wearing a Slipknot shirt. But thank someone, there was a guy wearing a nickleback shirt. Laughed my ass off then thought about it. "
"Nu metal fans...","Thanks for mentioning the ""where you live"" aspect. I also am trying to bring that into the mix for my research as well, to see if there are any trends in locations. Where is it that you live?
My notion, from what i've experienced throughout the years, in addition to being a nu metal fan myself, is the fans seem to come from more suburban areas as opposed to big cities.. and growing up in NYC, that in itself is a tricky subject in its entirety.."
"Nu metal fans...","The fans are pretty much the same as other metal fans; some are nice and accepting of all genres of music, some are just as elitist as ""true metal"" fans towards metalcore and stuff. Tends to be more the former though, which is nice. 

As for why there is distaste for Nu metal from the aforementioned ""true metal"" fans, it's because they feel like it's a watered down, crappy version of their metal, and has different origins so it shouldn't be considered metal at all. Personally I like both and I get sick of everyone arguing and being elitist about it"
"Nu metal fans...","The fans can't really be described. I have been to Nu Metal shows where it seems like the traditional metal crowd of nothing but Slayer shirts and the like, then there are the shows where no one is alike. As far as the distaste, I think it come down to the fact that Nu Metal is considered Rap/Metal to most people. Bands like System of a Down and Slipknot (although some of their earlier work doesn't fit this) don't look toward the rap side of things but to the metal side. I think what it comes down to is that there is nothing like Nu Metal, kinda like when Grunge came out no one liked it because it was so far-fetched, but over time this fades. I think we are seeing this now. To be fair Nu Metal really wasn't what it was before. System of a Down has been on hiatus for years, Slipknot is Stone Sour (let's hope the new album isn't just Come What(Ever) May redone like AHIG was), Limp Biscuit doesn't exist, Linkin Park really isn't even a shadow of their former selves. The only band that is still in the roots and trying to keep the genre relevant is Korn, and in my opinion, poorly. I can keep going, any other questions just ask. "
"Nu metal fans...","Deftones are also doing good job keeping to their roots,  their sound didn't drastically change over the years"
"Nu metal fans...","Never really got into Deftones that much, don't know why. Saw them live a couple years back when they opened for System of a Down. That might be it, they were good, but not SOAD good. THEY NEED TO COME OFF HIATUS. GODDAMN IT SERJ!"
"Nu metal fans...","Uh, Limp Bizkit are still going. They brought out a (great) album recently and have another one out this year. "
"Nu metal fans...","Really Fred Durst is still doing music. i really thought that after the Woodstock incident that Limp Biscuit just kind of fell off. Hmmm, good to know. "
"Nu metal fans...","Yeah, Wes Borland has a side project too, Black Light Burns, they're alright. "
"Nu metal fans...","yeah I was about to say."
"Nu metal fans...","Would you say that Linkin Park tried to evolve, and maybe even redefine themselves as a band, musically and lyrically?"
"Nu metal fans...","Yes, I think they tried to hard however. The fan base has been all over the place. It reminds me of Green Day in a way. Linkin Park, like Green Day, tried to get more into the mainstream, well radio play in general, but by this they lost a considerable portion of their hardcore fanbase. For me this is like Slipknot. I am a HUGE fan of everything from MFKR to Vol. 3, All Hope Is Gone however made me wish for more, it sounded too much like Stone Sour. This seems to be the problem in general with newer metal. The bands stray too far from the start (Metallica) and lose footing but gain it with ""posers"". I don't like to think of it that way but it is the easiest way to put into words. I understand that bands don't want to remain stagnant in their style and that people grow, but without your fans, especially those of us that have been there from the start, you get forgotten, much like that of Limp Biscuit and Puddle of Mudd to name a couple. I like a  band to experiment, but not to make it THE sound, I think of Path of Totality by Korn in this. Dubstep-Metal fusion sounds cool, but a whole album release of it is too far from standard.  "
"Nu metal fans...","Personally I feel that Nu Metal gets a bad rap with the ""traditional"" metal community due to its traditional sound of adding elements of Pop and Hip Hop to what was usually a detuned low heavy sound from a 7 string guitar.  
Fortunetly I was in Jr High and High School during that time so I was loving the wave of Nu Metal bands coming out.  Slipknot, KoRn, MUSHROOMHEAD, Static X, Linkin Park (pre suck period) Sevendust, and the list can go on and on.  Yes I do consider RATM Nu Metal. 

So short answer, the hate comes from Too much Pop and Hip Hop for the metal crowd, too much Metal for the mainstream hip hop and pop crowd.  The market just got over saturated in the late nineties early 2000's.  But as a teenager then with serious family issues, god I loved it."
"Nu metal fans...","Don't care about other fans and don't care what any other genre thinks about nu metal really.  Nu metal is pretty refined and well produced.  I still love Limp bizkit's music - wes borland is amazing."
"Nu metal fans...","To be honest, in my opinion, people see it as a bit 'edgy' compared to other sub-genres of metal and rock. I'm not the type of person to follow music because of it's factors such as 'coolness', or 'edgyness', and I certainly don't care about what people think of my music taste. Some people are very elitist towards their music taste, and Nu-metal is something that seems to be 'outdated' in music these days, so I understand why people don't really like it, but that's their opinion, and I still don't care. 

I have listened to nu-metal a bit less recently, but that's just because I like exploring music. Nothing against the music. "
"Nu metal fans...","I feel Nu-Metal derived its musical influences for a wide variety of music. That what made it stand out out and drew people to at. The same could be said about why people didnt like it. If you look at bands like Mushroomhead, American Head Charge and Static X, there was a very industrial kinda feel/sound mixed into their music. Look at bands like Bionic Jive, Limp Bizkit, Stuck Mojo and (Hed) P.E there was a big hip hop influence on their sound and style. But that the same time they had their own niche. Stuck Mojo had more a metalcore feel from time to time. Bionic Jive had downtune chugs a la Meshuggah. Limp Bizkit was more of a traditional hip hop metal crossover. But than theres (Hed) P.E who took everything from metal,punk,hip hop,rasta,funk even swing was incorperated into their sound and style. Snot was also another band that kinda blended alot of sounds together. Then you have bands like Deftones,Nothingface and newer Mudvayne that had that post grunge/metal thing going on. There was also a theatrical aspect to it as well. Bands like Slipknot,Mudvayne,Motograter and Mushroomhead brought in masks and body paint. All these things made up the melting pot of what is Nu-Metal. The musical style to the fashion sence was all affected. Remember the big baggy pants with the 12000 zippers and straps? These are all reasons why it was loved/hated so much. A less metal person could like nu metal because it wasnt thrash,death,black or traditional. An elitist hated it cuz it was washed down metal sprinkled with other kinds of music. I love it, but i enjoy alot of music so thats probibly why."
"Nu metal fans...","The fans are thought to wear the same clothes as the people in the bands. Chains, baggy shorts,t-shirts, hoodies, eyebrow piercings and  skateboards as an accessory. There is a distaste because of general prejudice. People who don't like nu metal, generally can't stand the music at all and characterise the music's fans as imbeciles since only such a person could possibly like such music. People really hate Fred Durst too, and the content of the lyrics of Korn and the general sound of Slipknot."
"Nu metal fans...","I couldn't answer about the fans but I think the hatred stems from people not thinking of it as ""pure metal"" and ""too mainstream"" by moving away from the routes into a more radio friendly wide style (which personally I think is absolute rubbish and music should be judged on people's enjoyment of it not who else likes it and whether it makes it onto the radio)"

"Taproot - Poem","This song...

Rewind back to 2003-ish. I'm sitting in the car, waiting on someone. The keys are in the ignition, and, since the parents aren't here, I can listen to whatever I want. Taking full advantage of their absence, I tune in to the local rock station. For a little bit, the music is ""meh"" - mostly stuff I've heard before or older rock.

But then, out of nowhere, the illest song hits the air waves. The guitar intro almost slipped by before I noticed it; but then the drums kick in, and I know this is going to be good. Bumping up the volume a bit, I am stunned as the bass kicks in; this is unlike anything I've ever heard before. The singing starts, and I like what I'm hearing. A lot. Not only does it sound awesome, but I can truly relate to these lyrics; I *live* this song. My mind is blown. This is unlike anything I've ever heard before. I continue to listen will full attention, dying to hear every second that follows, but then, mid-song,

*--Complete Silence--*

The silence continues for a little bit, and, thoroughly confused, I frantically check the radio: keys are in, station is tuned, volume is up - what is going on!?

*--Sweet guitar intro; Wicked Drums; Bass pounding, resonating within my chest--*

The song starts over. From the beginning. This was meant to be.

The song plays again, from the beginning and (this time) to the end. It's the best thing I've ever heard, and ends up becoming my favorite song. It gets me through 10th grade, and, eventually, through graduation and into college.

To this day it's *still* one of (if not my) favorite songs.

**TL;DR** - I love this song; it's possibly my favorite song of all time."

"Looking for non-US underground Nu Metal Bands to play with","I'm guessing underground means somewhat obscure?  If so maybe you should try contacting System of a Down.  Their singer is non-native and all of them are of foreign descent, but were actually born here.  You wouldn't know it listening to them, though.  Serj (the singer) really gives it a nice foreign feel."

Honestly, these albums are practically the epitome of nu metal, and yet so many people will tell you that they were merely lumped in with the other nu metal bands of the time. I can understand the reason for doing so, as the term nu metal has sort of a stigma attached to it, but there is simply no denying that these two first albums fit the bill. Deftones don't get their own genre, they are nu metal."

"Bracket Day 6: Fred Durst V.S. Mushroom Head Trio","After being discovered by KoRn, Fred Durst lead Limp Bizket into Stardom of the 90's. Not many artists affected people the way Fred Durst did. He took America by a Nookie storm with his catchy but also somewhat humorous songs that people just couldn't get enough of (well until the 2000's).

Waylon Reavis Jason Popson and Jeffrey Hatrix and together they make up the Mushroom Head Trio Vocalists.  Mushroom head started in Cleveland Ohio in the 90's and has been followed by a loyal fan base over the years. Much like Slipknot, Mushroom head has many members and they all wear masks. However, Mushroom Heads combination of three different vocalists leaves a very unique sound that cant be replicated.

"Bracket Day 2 Matchup: Linkin Park Duo V.S. Jacoby Shaddix","Voting for LP.

Feel like this might be unfair because of the range that Chester and Mike achieve as two people, but they are dynamic.

Also, for the record, it's *really* hard voting against Infest.

*EDIT for clarity"
"Bracket Day 2 Matchup: Linkin Park Duo V.S. Jacoby Shaddix","Eh, I don't really look at it that way. Just think, Linkin Park has to have two singers to do what many other bands can do with just one.  Linkin Park makes it work, but it could also hurt them as much as help them."
"Bracket Day 2 Matchup: Linkin Park Duo V.S. Jacoby Shaddix","That's a fair assessment. I think it's just that when I think of them, I often look forward to hearing two very distinct voices sharing a song, particularly so on all the early material. I feel like the disparity has grown lately, with more ""solo"" lead vocal tracks (like ""Given Up"" vs. ""When they Come..."").

Songs like ""Points of Authority"" I feel are the fucking best examples of how the back-and-forth makes them work as one (actually all of Hybrid Theory plays this up perfectly). It's almost like the mood of the song seamlessly shifts back and forth between their verses. They complement each other really fucking well."
"Bracket Day 2 Matchup: Linkin Park Duo V.S. Jacoby Shaddix","Voting for LP. Chester is just amazing. And even though I love Papa Roach, I can't stand Last Resort. The rest of Infest is awesome, I just hate that song."
"Bracket Day 2 Matchup: Linkin Park Duo V.S. Jacoby Shaddix","Gotta agree with that. 

Infest killed, but ""Last Resort"" doesn't quite stand the test of time. ""Snakes"", ""Dead Cell"", ""Never Enough"", ""Between Angels..."" however, are all sooo good.

Chester is great; as a big STP fan too I'm really torn about the current situation, but if Scott's gotta go, Chester is a surprisingly good replacement. Shinoda really gets me though man, and as amazing as HT and Meteora are, some of his verses on the more recent... uh, ""different"" albums were fucking unreal (""Bleed it Out"" and ""When They Come for Me"" REALLY pop)."
"Bracket Day 2 Matchup: Linkin Park Duo V.S. Jacoby Shaddix","Infest is still my favorite Papa Roach album, with Lovehatetradgedy close behind. Everything off Infest kills, but Last Resort reminds me of my awkward 5th grade experience. It got old really fast

"Bracket Day 11: Jonathan Davis (1) V.S. Fred Durst (2)","It's a battle of old friends and major players in this round of the bracket. Korn and Limp Bizkit have been connected sense the early days. Both singers have done much for the Numetal genre and have experimented in there own ways. Will Fred's raps and rhymes take him to the next round or will John's scats and growls be enough to carry on?

Jonathan Davis of Korn:  43
Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit:  44

Corey Taylor of Slipknot:  40
Who are their successors?"
"Our legends are getting older, who's in the next wave?","My Ticket Home"
"Our legends are getting older, who's in the next wave?","Closest we got right now for a new wave is My Ticket Home and Hollywood Undead."
"Our legends are getting older, who's in the next wave?","I don't think there will be very many successors within nu metal. Metalcore is what's popular now, I think Nu Metal is basically a ~20 year phase that is now giving way to metalcore and whatever other -core genres. That's not to say it has died completely, but I don't think we're going to see any more new bands that can replicate what bands like SOAD, Slipknot, Korn etc did"
"Our legends are getting older, who's in the next wave?","i will."
"Our legends are getting older, who's in the next wave?","I hate to say it, but at the moment: nobody. Why? The current trend is metalcore or other *core genres, especially deathcore because everybody is trying to out br00tal each other these days. It's going to be a while before a young crowd creates a popular scene with the cross-genre experimentation that nu-metal brought on.

Everything has its phase. The base is of nu-metal hasn't truly died, but basically the only ones that care are the people that connected with it when it reached its maximum exposure. 

I am still constantly in search of new nu-metal style bands. They're out there, but they are few and far to be found."
"Our legends are getting older, who's in the next wave?","Nu Metal's time has passed. Metalcore has replaced it in the eyes of commercial success. Attila is a metalcore band that I think is the closest to Nu Metal I've heard in a while."

"Our legends are getting older, who's in the next wave?","bloodsimple, no warning, hail the villain (no longer together but six side die, which is the lead singers current band is awesome). It's harder and harder to find numetal bands,back when i was in high school were the glory days of numetal, when bodies by drowning pool and dig by mudvayne were constantly on mtv2, q101 here in chicago constantly played bands like 3 days grace, skindred, mudvayne, korn.

"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","Fuckin hell man. They're both awesome. Korn is my favorite band of all time so I'm gonna be a bit biased but John really does have a unique and incredible voice, especially his range. His growls are waaay better than Corey's. Corey on the other hand has such an intense and visceral voice that you can't help but love. He has the most consistent screams out of any singer I've heard. But in the end I'd say John, he's more well rounded IMO."
"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","Corey Taylor is about the best versatile rock/metal guy out there.  Jonathon does a great job with vocal melodies especially for a guy that doesn't have a classic good voice but Corey could even make a living singing clean.  He's got better cleans and can go harsher on the other end.  Jonathon does have the death skat though!"
"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","I pick Jonathan Davis because I'm a huge Korn fan, and I love his scat singing."
"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","Corey Taylor for me, no competition. There are only about 4 Korn songs that I really like, plus some of his JDevil stuff"
"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","After seeing both bands live I have to say Jonathan. His live sets are incredibly good! Much better than his studio versions."
"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","I agree that Jonathan is still great, especially live, but for me Corey is better. To each his own :)"
"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","Have you seen stone sour of Slipknot live?"
"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","I saw stone sour. Haven't had the chance to see Slipknot yet. One day though!"
"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","I love them both, but I gotta go with Corey Taylor, being a bigger Slipknot fan."
"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","They are two different beasts imo. They are two of my favs, but corey is continuing to improve and impress, Jon is not. "
"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","Jonathan Davis. Without a doubt!"
"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","You guys need to listen to some metal."
"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","what do you mean by that?"
"Corey Taylor vs. Jonathon Davis","Jonathan Davis and Corey Taylor don't really have extremely great harsh vocal abilities. Jon is OK but derivative, and Taylor is basically impossible to understand live.

Jon's strength, to me, has always been in the fact that he has a unique-sounding voice. He's not an amazing singer, he just sounds *distinct*. 

Taylor, on the other hand, has a strong voice, and his strength is in the fact that he can go from clean vocals to harsh vocals very quickly, even within the same breath.

In terms of overall vocal quality, neither of them comes close to most quality metal vocalists."

"Building myself a list of Nu-Metal artists/albums.","So I'm trying to put together a Slacker custom station on my account (http://www.slacker.com/station/custom/76882596/1368913508?sharedby=76882596&amp;sharedon=1368998852) and also collect some of the albums of the more quintessential Nu-Metal era albums and artists. I'm skipping over the more unquestionable ones like KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Sevendust, etc. I'm trying to build this around the more aggressive-toned midstream and underground bands. So far I have:

* Flaw
* Unloco
* 40 Below Summer
* American Head Charge
* Dry Kill Logic
* Motograter
* Five.Bolt.Main
* Lifer
* Bloodsimple
* Apartment 26
* Ill Nino
* Stereomud
* Slaves On Dope
* grade 8
* Switched
* Nothingface
* Endo
* One Minute Silence
* Ultraspank
* 3rd Strike
* Onesidezero
* Noise Therapy
* Another Black Day
* The Union Underground
* Coal Chamber
* Lo-Pro
* Five Pointe O
* Systematic
* Twisted Method
* Epidemic
* Nullset
* Spineshank
* Videodrone
* Reveille
* Boy Hits Car
* Ra
* Snot
* Stuck Mojo
* Factory 81
* Cold 
* Nonpoint 
* Primer 55
* Taproot
* Soulfly and Sepultura (*Roots* album) 
* Smaxxide (suggested by natonio95)
* Project 86, Travail and shuvel (suggested by disciple_walks)

Yes, I know, it's a long list already. Slacker did a lot of the work for me already. I'm just trying to find out if there's any other bands I could add to the list that may not be crossing my mind right now. Well, let me know."

"Building myself a list of Nu-Metal artists/albums.","You should include Smaxxide, they're a Nu-Metal band from Germany."
"Building myself a list of Nu-Metal artists/albums.","Hrm, they don't come up on Slacker unfortunately. But I'll add to this if you want."
"Building myself a list of Nu-Metal artists/albums.","While dredg is one of my favorite bands of all time, I wouldn't call them nu-metal. Still, they're good on any list.

I'd add:

- pitchshifter
- The Deadlights
- Genuflect
- Filter
- Far
- Shuvel
- Puya

and maybe I'll think of some more later."
"Building myself a list of Nu-Metal artists/albums.","You're right about Dredg. They came up as a suggested band and I thought they sounded like a name for a numetal band so I included it. My bad. 

I added Shuvel last night. I didn't think about Genuflect. Pitchshifter is a band that I love but I think lumping them into numetal isn't fair. "

"Building myself a list of Nu-Metal artists/albums.","I wouldn't lump 36CF into numetal, they've been more post-hardcore and metalcore. Taproot and Primer 55 I guess I could put in there. "
"Building myself a list of Nu-Metal artists/albums.","Agreed on 36. I find taproot to be quintessential nu metal. Primer too, but not necessarily good by metal."
"Building myself a list of Nu-Metal artists/albums.","I've actually always liked Primer 55. Even got to see them recently (mainly it's just the guitarist keeping it going). "

"Building myself a list of Nu-Metal artists/albums.","Yeah I know about shuvel. I originally opted out of including them because some of the Nu-Metal fans really look down on them.

Relative Ash, Pulse Ultra, Crossbreed, Factory 81"
"Building myself a list of Nu-Metal artists/albums.","I love Crossbreed, I just don't think of them as nu-metal. I think they're more like an industrial band. "

"Building myself a list of Nu-Metal artists/albums.","I love Dirty Wormz, but they're not as close to what I'm looking for. They're more of a rapcore band. I'm trying to find bands that are more genuinely representative of the rock/metal aspect of the genre. "

"New WIP by Internet Death Machine","I just stumbled on this when I was looking through music on sound cloud.
https://soundcloud.com/internetdeathmachine/tonight/s-qOtsH

It seems like an interesting take on Linkin Park's style of music. I have not heard of the band or group before.
What do you guys think? Is it good? Bad? Indifferent?

I actually like it. I may be a little Linkin Park bias though since I just went to their concert (maybe everything sounds like them to me atm) :)"
"New WIP by Internet Death Machine","Panicide is pretty good, but ""tonight"" feels way to forced"
"New WIP by Internet Death Machine","Yeah IDM is my project, and the reason they sound forced is because in essence they are at that point.  I write the vocal melody as I sing it, record it so I have the tune down, and then decide how to sing it.  After that, I record the final version.  See the link in my post above for an idea of how the finished product sounds vocally.  Anyway, glad you enjoyed Panicide."

&gt;
&gt;    Disturbed
&gt;    Papa Roach
&gt;    any rap/rock overlaps like Linkin Park, Kid Rock, Crazy Town, or Limp Bizkit

Why stay away from these bands? This is just your own opinion, why should anyone else stay away from them?

I would say that [Infest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF8-bYhj7I4) is one of the best nu metal albums ever. Of course after that Papa Roach changed their sound and it is no longer nu metal.

Wiki - Nu metal (also known as new metal, neo-metal, n√º-metal, or aggro-metal) is a subgenre of alternative metal that fuses elements of heavy metal music with those of multiple other genres, most notably ones like hip hop, funk, and grunge.

"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","For the past couple years, I've only been listening to male-fronted bands. I have no problem with that, as I even front a small act like that in my town. However, listening to people with the same kind of range gets boring after so long, so I wanted to see if there were any female-fronted ones that are good?"
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Infected Rain. You might like Straight Line Stitch also.

Edit to add to this (and they're not necessarily nu-metal either): In This Moment (they're pretty mainstream now so I don't know how you *wouldn't* know them by now), Halestorm, Amaranthe (power metal, 1 female and 2 male singers), Butcher Babies (they suck though; they only sell records because their singers look like porn stars), Nightwish, Lacuna Coil (both beauty/beast style vocals, NW is more operatic while LC is more active rock). "
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Straight Line Stitch for sure. "
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","I don't really like Halestorm, In this Moment and Lacuna Coil. I think Halestorm is the only one I don't listen to (much) anymore, because I find that they're a band you can get sick of too quickly. From what you said about them Butcher Babies probably won't work out well for me, as I can only tolerate bands who don't suck. I like Infected Rain and Straight Line Stitch too. Amaranthe, however blew me away. I think they're more tech-metal, but that didn't stop me from liking them. They have some songs that make me think of 80s pop at certain parts, and I personally think that's awesome.

*^Jesus ^Christ ^this ^felt ^like ^I ^was ^reviewing ^at ^certain ^points.*"
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","It's alright, I was just giving you some other bands to look into. I'm not a huge fan of Halestorm myself. I personally really like In This Moment and Lacuna Coil, though, but they're not for everyone."
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","I messed up. I meant that I *listened* to Halestorm, In This Moment, and Lacuna Coil before."
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Kitty

Eths"
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Just checked out Kittie. Thy're pretty good. I didn't really like Eths though, mainly because I don't really like songs in other languages.
"
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Fair enough lol

Eths did an English version of Adonai so you might like that idk

Does Evanescence count as nu metal?"
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Cool. I think Evanescence counts. They sound a bit like Korn, and Korn is nu-metal."
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","I'll be sure to check that song out. Who knows, It might change my mind?"
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Straight Line Stitch is very good. Does In This Moment count? "
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","I agree. I think In This Moment counts, however I'm no judge on what's nu-metal or not."
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Atakama  
Slot  
ETHS

Flyleaf  
Otep  
Kittie  
Exilia  
Heavensdust  
Kontrust  
MyPollux  "
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","I like Head Phones President and Flyleaf. Flyleaf kinda reminds me of Halestorm. Exilia's pretty good too. I found it kinda cool that their guitarist looks like a young Jonathan Davis. Heavensdust is pretty cool. I don't really like Kontrust though."
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Try Tracktor bowling too."
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Upvoted for head phones president, kontrust, and exilia. Can't believe I had to scroll down this far just to see them. "
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Check out Animal Alpha"
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Just checked them out. I don't really like them that much, mainly 'cause their singers voice makes me cringe at many points in their songs."
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","I could see that. Their singer is really melodramatic and kinda childish, but it all works for me. Their song ""Fire! Fire! Fire!"" is one of my most favorite songs ever."
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Within Temptation

Huntress

Arch Enemy (maybe not nu-metal)"
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Just checked out Arch-Enemy, and I think they sound a bit like Avenged Sevenfold. Not that I have a problem with that, though. I'll check out the other two later.

EDIT: Just checked out Huntress and Within Temptation. Huntress sounds a bit like Metallica or Judas Priest, but with the vocals of a girl. Meanwhile, like the other bands you guys suggested, Within Temptation blows me away. I cannot compare them to any other band that I know of, but if I have to I would say Dream Theater because of the way the synth is."
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","If you liked Within Temptation (and I see you liked Amaranthe), you may like Epica. Not nu-metal, but an excellent band nonetheless"
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Glad you've enjoyed them.

Anther suggestion is Lacuna Coil.  Song suggestion would be Heaven's a Lie."
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Within Temptation are amazing. Their albums just get better and better"
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Otep, Eths (they're mostly french but a few English songs, Arch Enemy (maybe nu metal ish? ), Dead Sara"
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","Love Otep and Arch Enemy, kinda meh towards Eths. Dead Sara I find sounds a bit like Green Day. I don't know how, but listening to them somehow reminds me of Green Day."
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","These are a bit mainstream, but I really enjoy:

[In this Moment - Blood](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZF5m-vmDzM) is fucking unreal. [Icon for Hire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_S9VvJM1PI) is awesome. Their breakdowns seal the deal. They kinda blur the lines between mainstream rock, nu-metal, punk, rock, pop and electronica. I just love those bands that take it all and make you bang your head to a steady, amazing groove.

These guys may be out there (System of a Down-ish, to me), but [Twelve Foot Ninja is awesome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ST85Sui43Q).

Perhaps my definition of Nu-metal is pushing the envelope? Developing beyond alternative/rap/metal?"
"Anyone know any good female-fronted nu-metal bands?","I'm a fan of Blue Stahli. Here's a link to a few of their songs

They bring back some memories of my childhood since I find their sound is a bit like early All-American Rejects ( self-titled and Move along and a bit of When the World Comes Down). It's almost like they took today's popular music and blended it with rock and stuff like that. It's fucking amazing!"

"korn live full set Rock Am Ring with Joey Jordison","My THEORY is during this time when the band really was having lineup issues, Jonathan Davis made up for it by having a bunch of supporting members on stage, his way trying to convey KoRn as a band was bigger as a whole, then the original 5 members.

But that 2nd drummer really was not needed at all."
"korn live full set Rock Am Ring with Joey Jordison","I believe they took inspiration from SLipknot. It's percussion to add that extra layer I guess, on some tracks it works well I think or it might just be a gimmick. "

"Possible new Slipknot album?","Not soon but not too far. I would guess if meetings go well next year then probably end of 2014 to early 2015 for a release. Shame there is at least a 5 year gap between albums but with the death of Gray I understand. When the monster reforms I can only imagine the outcome. I personally hope for an Iowa like return. "

"Slipknot - The Devil In I (new)",""
"Slipknot - The Devil In I (new)","i really like the song"
"Slipknot - The Devil In I (new)","I like it. A lot of people are complaining that it sounds too much like Stone Sour, but I think that's not entirely true and not a bad thing anyway. Can't wait for the other 14 songs!"
"Slipknot - The Devil In I (new)","I did a bad thing by reading the comments on the negative one's youtube page. People bitching about it sounding TOO much like old school slipknot. So they released a song that sounds like new slipknot. Then people bitch about that. I think the thing to take away from this experience is that most metal fans are a pessimistic bunch. "
"Slipknot - The Devil In I (new)","Yeah, no matter what they do people are gonna complain. As Corey said on Twitter, the millions who can appreciate a great song are more important"
"Slipknot - The Devil In I (new)","Exactly why I literally just left /r/shreddit "
"Slipknot - The Devil In I (new)","It's decent, but nowhere near as good as The Negative One is."
"Slipknot - The Devil In I (new)","Yeah I thaught the same. It's still a very good song but The Negative One is my favourite out of those two. It has more punch."
"Slipknot - The Devil In I (new)","Awesome song, I really like it."
"Slipknot - The Devil In I (new)","This song is shit. The last one was good. It sounds like Stone Sour 2.0. I don't think Corey knows how to write a Slipknot song anymore. The clean vocals aren't the problem, it's the whole vibe of the song. There is a lack of energy, the riff is boring and the drumming isn't anything to rave about despite being one of the better aspects of the track. I am sick of seeing dumbasses blindly defend anything they put out on other websites. It's a boring track. However, the rest of the album will probably be better and this is more than likely the radio friendly track, a la Dead Memories, even though Dead Memories was far better written."
"Slipknot - The Devil In I (new)","You missed a word. This song is *the* shit. "

"Way underrated song Limp Bizkit - Just Drop Dead","The story is pretty damn great too"
"Bands Similar to System of a Down?","I've been really into SoaD recently and would like band recommendations for a fan. Thanks!"
"Bands Similar to System of a Down?","They're really a pretty unique band.  There isn't going to be as easy a comparison to them as most other bands.  Perhaps if you chose a particular thing that you liked the most about them it would help.  The manic singing?  The guitars?  The lyrical subject matter?"
"Bands Similar to System of a Down?","I *really* like the singing and drumming."
"Bands Similar to System of a Down?","If you don't already know about it there is Serj Tankien's solo work, and Malakian's side project Scars On Broadway. They aren't SOAD but it is familiar feeling.

Other bands I enjoy but not necessarily System-like in no order: 

* Disturbed
* Device &lt;- Has a song featuring Serj
* White Zombie
* Rob Zombie
* Volbeat
* Stone Temple Pilots
* Audioslave
* Soundgarden
* Rise Against
* Rage Against The Machine
* Queens Of The Stone Again
* Hail The Villain &lt;- Hope these guys are going to do more
* Bullet For My Valentine
* Alice In Chains &lt;- Really enjoy their new album"
"Bands Similar to System of a Down?","I think most of these are in the general ballpark. The true problem is there is nothing like SOAD other than SOAD. Serj and Scars are pretty meh. Elect the Dead and Harakiri were okay, but the was something missing. Reminds me of looking for other bands like Coheed and Cambria. Sometimes bands get lumped into a genre they truly are kinda into but mostley just progressive with a lot of influences to a particular genre."
"Bands Similar to System of a Down?","Maximum the Hormone. Yeah, they are Japanese, but the energy is very similar to SoaD.

"Bands Similar to System of a Down?","Check out The Apex Theory. The original drummer of SOAD was the singer and did a pretty damn good job at it. I'd also recommend Ultraspank (these guys have an album called Progress that is regarded as one of the best nu metal albums ever), Mudvayne, Nothingface, Spineshank, Cold, Unloco, American Head Charge, Ill Nino, Breaking Benjamin, and a whole bunch more. Dude if you ever want new music hit me up!"
"Bands Similar to System of a Down?","[Opus Dai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgqdtjRha4), for some reason they came to mind. Not a well known band, but I think they go towards that unique feel that System fills. You're not gonna find something that sounds the same, even this doesn't, but it's different from the other suggestions you've gotten on this page.

A couple of weeks ago a song form a band called PAIN was posted, I had never heard of them before and as since become one of my favourite bands, thats the kinda content I want to see, but thats my two cents, I like this sub regardless but I feel like it could benefit from this. "
"Can we get a blacklist like r/metal?","Like the others are saying, blacklistning the big band is not needed yet because of the subreddit being so small. But the re-post rule from /r/metal would be nice, so we still could see numbers from the big and small bands and not see ""Falling Away From Me"" - KoRn for the X time."
"Can we get a blacklist like r/metal?","I would say this sub is too small to start banning things like that just yet.  "
"Can we get a blacklist like r/metal?","I feel like the best and biggest days of nu-metal are behind us, and although I love the genre, I think that it's unavoidable that there is going to be a lot of re-posting moving forward. "
"Can we get a blacklist like r/metal?","I think we should just blacklist certain songs like ""Freak on a Leash"" by Korn, ""Rollin"" by Limp Bizkit or ""Chop Suey"" by System of a Down.  Most nu metal fans already know those songs so there's no point in posting them.  People could still post unknown songs from Korn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Slipknot or System of a Down but not their biggest hits."

My personal favorites minus the big leagues are hed pe, Ultraspank, and American Head Charge. Some that I can't stand are Adema and Vacant Stare.

Edit: fucked up the title, should say favorite/least favorite."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","other than the obvious ones i would say my favorite nu metal bands would be mudvayne and Lacuna Coil. least favorite? Mushroomhead and papa roach "
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Papa Roach has some damn good songs in my opinion, but their radio singles are shit. Last Resort is one of the worst nu metal songs ever."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Infest is one of my favorite albums. But they just kept getting worse after that."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","I love Infest. Thrown Away is quite possibly their best song."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","i like a couple roach songs but they don't do much for me "
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Highly recommend you see them live. Your opinion may change. Mine did."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","hey it happened when i saw pod and saliva and maroon five and 21 pilots and adrenaline mob so hey "
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Staind are pretty bad, but Hollywood undead are fucking awful imo "
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Staind has some good songs, but I completely agree with Hollywood. Terrible band."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Ew I totally forgot about Hollywood Undead. I can't take them seriously at all."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Right!? cringey as fuck, as well as bad in general "
"Least favorite nu metal band?","I used to listen to them when I was 12-13. I cringe at the thought of it.."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","I listen to Slipknot, Limp Bizkit, Deftones, Korn, Linkin Park, Static-X, Powerman 5000 and Coal Chamber. Sometimes to System of A Down and Mudvayne. I listen to what I like.

I can't get into Papa Roach. They have some okey songs, but nothing spectacular, to me. Spineshank is not THAT good, to me. It just doesn't click for me there."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Oooh I forgot about Spineshank, I love those guys. Still, it was a bit if a stretch giving them a grammy nomination. Are you excited for Coal Chambers new album?"
"Least favorite nu metal band?","I really am. The thing I am wondering a lot about is the sound of new album. They have said it will be a lot different... For some reason I can feel that the first song they will release will have a The Negative One-feel to it. It will just punch you in the face and when it is close to the end, it finishes with power and then just dissapears.

If that made any sense! Are you excited?

"
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Hell yeah I'm excited! I loved Dark Days to death, still my favorite album of theirs. That album on it's own was way different from Chamber Music, which is way different from their self titled. If they continue on the path that they were on before splitting up I have no doubt their next album is gonna kick ass. Dez said himself that he's never been more excited to be in the studio working on something, so there are virtually no negatives about it in my mind."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Hopefully, this will be mindblowing!"
"Least favorite nu metal band?","I love Deftones, Limp Bizkit, Korn and more but I don't remember. There's a band who is very confusing to me, Papa Roach. I love pre-Infest albums like Old Friends From Young Years or 5 Tracks Deep or even Infest itself, but I goddamn hate all the albums after that I just can't get into it."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","I completely agree. I love all of Infest except Last Resort. Can't stand that song for the life of me. But its the other way around for the rest of their albums. I can't stand most of there albums at all actually. The only other ones I like are The Connection and like half of Lovehatetragedy and Getting Away With Murder. Metamorphosis was awful, so was FEAR, so was Paramour Sessions. It's so weird, I've never been so all over the place with a band. "
"Least favorite nu metal band?","I've never been a fan of Linkin Park, and fuck Hollywood Undead."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","I think Korn is pretty fucking horrible. But then again, I'm not really a big fan of Nu-metal. Disturbed and Slipknot is pretty much the only nu bands I listen to. "
"Least favorite nu metal band?","If you don't like Nu-metal then why are you subscribed to this sub?"
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Well, I didn't say I don't like Nu-Metal at all. It's just not my favorite. I try to keep a open view on metal,  and I'm subbed to pretty much all metal subreddits. If someone share some new music I can check it out and see if I like it regardless of sub genre. "
"Least favorite nu metal band?","More metalheads should be like you dude."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","If you don't like nu metal you're probably not gonna like Korn. I'm surprised you like Slipknot though, most Slipknot fans love Korn. "
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Huge korn fan here. Can't stand slipknot. "
"Least favorite nu metal band?","I stand corrected. Did you catch em on the prepare for hell tour?"
"Least favorite nu metal band?","I live in Canada.., Alberta, and it's busy season I the oil and gas industry right now so I couldn't get anytime off work, unfortunately no, I'd really only want to see korn. I'm sure they'll do another tour."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","They plan on doing a 20th anniversary tour for their self titled album so hopefully they'll give Canada a visit."
"Least favorite nu metal band?","That would be nice "
"Least favorite nu metal band?","I agree with you. I'm not exactly a massive nu metal fan, but there are a few bands I like (Disturbed, Slipknot and Mushroomhead being the main ones). Korn is just...terrible. I think they have 3 songs that I like"
"Least favorite nu metal band?","You're breaking my heart man, Korn is my favorite band lol. But I totally get it, they're definitely not for everyone. So what bands outside of the nu metal realm do you listen to?"
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Melodic death is my favourite genre, but I listen to pretty much anything. Some of my favourite bands are Destinity, Arch Enemy, Kataklysm, Metallica, Dimmu Borgir, Psyclon Nine"
"Least favorite nu metal band?","Love me some melodic death metal, just recently saw Amon Amarth live. And I've met very few people who like Psyclon Nine, I love em. If I could recommend one nu metal album that I think is one of the best it'd be The War of Art by American Head Charge. If you're into Slipknot you'll probably like it, seeing that clown helped produce it. "

Posting these links is like someone going to /r/metal and posting ""Master of Puppets"" and ""Enter Sandman"". 

I do personally tend to see nu-metal as more of an era of rock rather than a whole genre unto itself. But there's plenty of active underground nu-metal style bands out there to listen to. /u/Mordrag_ posts quite a few. I just posted a link to an a very active band I follow called Hate Grenade.

"What exactly is NuMetal? Sevendust is not one, are they?","Recently Sevendust has come up in my playlists and I'm finding a few songs are pretty solid, and I have arrived 15 years too late. But I read up on them and find they are classified as ""NuMetal"".

I'm a fan of a lot of metal, whatever it's classified as ""NuMetal"" or whatever the hell, but I have a hard time grasping this classification. 

NuMetal to me has always been something like Limp Bizkit. Clear hybrid rock/rap (assuming that's the definition). Or Korn, I have a conflicted time thinking they are NuMetal since they are more like ""groove metal"" J Davis isn't exactly the rapper type like Fred Durst, but since they teamed up I guess they're in the same camp? Even people who say Faith No More was a precursor to NuMetal because Mike Patton ""rapped"" on Epic confuses me because FNM was not remotely NuMetal as a whole. It's like saying Led Leppelin was precursor to NIN.

Or how people think STP/Smashing Pumpkins was ""grunge"" because they came out the same time as Nirvana, even though their music really wasn't grunge.

Take, for example, this song - [Reconnect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A_sIDDzhzA)

Or even one of the newest songs - [Picture Perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wDgSepBVHU)

Maybe I'm just taking a small sample, but how is that ""nu metal"" exactly? What differentiates the muted guitar + bass drum + bass from something like, say, Meshuggah? (Of course they elaborate more on that, but still)

I don't know, maybe I'm completely oblivious as to what ""NuMetal"" means. That or people are just blurring the lines between bands. I often see System of a Down as numetal, but I'm also confused by that one."
"What exactly is NuMetal? Sevendust is not one, are they?","Nu-Metal is less of a genre and more of a wave of music (e.g NWOBHM). No one in the right mind can say a band like System of a Down sounds like a band like Linkin Park or Deftones, but their music all came out around the same time so they're all classified as Nu-Metal. Nu-Metal is more general genre mixing than just rap &amp; rock (E.G, Slipknot barely raps in their songs, but the mix of clean vocals and groovish like riffs makes them nu-metal.)"
"What exactly is NuMetal? Sevendust is not one, are they?","OMG, someone who doesn't think anything rap+rock=nu-metal. Thank you, good sir. "
"What exactly is NuMetal? Sevendust is not one, are they?"," I believe NuMetal is the classification for hard rock that came out in the 90s after 80s metal dried up. Most genres are descriptive of the music itself while numetal is more of a time period in metal history. Actually that may be why smashing pumpkins and STP are considered grunge, they came out along side the grunge movement...

"What exactly is NuMetal? Sevendust is not one, are they?","Yes, yes they are numetal. "
"What exactly is NuMetal? Sevendust is not one, are they?","Nu-metal is a derivative of metal, hip hop, and alternative. It uses downtuned guitars, and a combination of melodic singing and screaming. Solos are very rarely used and lyrical themes are usually personal and depressive. The bass is commonly slapped and guitar riffs are usually simplistic. Verses are usually accompanied by eerie guitar tones and ambience. It is not uncommon to see synthesizers and even DJs in nu-metal bands. 

Popular nu bands would include Korn, System of a Down, Slipknot, Sevendust, and Mudvayne. 

To easily identify a song as nu-metal, check to see if it has metal-style instrumentals, singing/rapping, and a simple song format (ie intro-verse-chorus-verse-chorys-bridge-chorus-outro)

Edit: just a note: only LiP and FtL are nu-metal albums by Korn. the other albums range from electro-rock to groove metal with melodeath influence"
"Linkin Park - The Hunting Party [FULL ALBUM]",""
"Linkin Park - The Hunting Party [FULL ALBUM]","Sounds great."
"Linkin Park - The Hunting Party [FULL ALBUM]","You got a downvote because this band doesnt deserve respect anymore.  Fight tooth and nail to release your first 2 albums on your own terms, then for the rest of your career make the music your label demanded of you in the first place.   And this was after the track ""Get Me Gone,"" where Mike Shinoda talked about the album that Warner wanted instead of Hybrid Theory, which then turned out to be what they released for Minutes To Midnight.  On top of that, the recent fiasco with Rome Ramirez, what they did to the band Dry Cell, and them being generally pretentious whiney hipsters nowadays, i just cant bring myself to give anything they release a chance anymore... my former favorite band died to me years ago... "
"Linkin Park - The Hunting Party [FULL ALBUM]","What'd they do to Dry Cell?"
"Linkin Park - The Hunting Party [FULL ALBUM]","When the Queen Of The Damned soundtrack came out, Dry Cell was signed to Warner Bros records, had begun touring in support of their soon-to-be-released album Disconnected.  When the members of Linkin Park heard the song ""Body Crumbles"" they pitched a hissy fit claiming that Warner was pushing a band that had stolen Linkin Park's signature sound (the sound that they have since abandoned), mostly because of the similarity between Chester Bennington and Jeff Gutt's singing styles.  When Warner let Dry Cell go, they refused to ship the hundreds of thousands of copies of Disconnected that had already been pressed and sought legal action if they continued to perform the songs from the album, all of which they wrote before they were signed.  This effectively put an end to one of the most promising underground bands of the last 2 decades, all because Linkin Park have a history of being whiny bitches that always have to get their way "
"Linkin Park - The Hunting Party [FULL ALBUM]","Damn. I always wondered why Slip Away or Body Crumbles didn't rocket those guys into super stardom. As much as I love Linkin Park, I gotta agree that they get whiney more often than any band should."
"Linkin Park - The Hunting Party [FULL ALBUM]","I think it's normal thing and understandable because they aren't that young and emotional anymore. They can't make something that they don't feel anymore. I appreciate their new stuff.

Edit:  Mudvayne seems pretty close.  They're not bad by any stretch.  Any others you recommend though?  I'm up for trying just about any band, but I don't like Slipknot.  I've got a fairly wide musical taste though, Skrillex, Infected Mushroom, Metallica, SYOAD, Korn, Disturbed, A7X, and now I'm probably going to be adding Mudvayne."

"Chelsea Grin - Right Now (Deathcore Korn Cover)","I hear this, and I think Korn's next ""experiment"" should be with djent music.  Dubstep was kinda fun, but I'd be interested to hear what new levels they'd get to with a sound like this :)"
"Chelsea Grin - Right Now (Deathcore Korn Cover)","Yeah I still like the original better, while I like screaming I think it sounds better if it is just used to punctuate the song, if the whole song is screaming it puts me off."
"Chelsea Grin - Right Now (Deathcore Korn Cover)","Deathcore is screams only. So they had to be true to their genre while covering a great song."

"Bracket Day 7: Chad Grey (1) V.S. Sonny Sandoval (4)","Chad Grey is best known in the new metal community for his work with Mudvayne. Mudvayne  was praised for their unique style and deep lyrical content along with the even mixture of different styles blended into one band. Chad Grey currently is working with the band Hellyeah putting out albums and touring, but many wish for his return to Mudvayne.

Sonny Sandoval is the lead singer of P.O.D or Playable on Death. Sonny is Numetal through and through and holds the best quality of being able to right a song that has such a deep meaning that it often times leaves the listener in aw. Although the lyrics maybe insightful P.O.D and Sonny never lack on a catchy tune that gets caught in your head.

UPDATE POLL CLOSED: CHAD GREY WILL BE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ROUND."
"Bracket Day 7: Chad Grey (1) V.S. Sonny Sandoval (4)","Chad Gray hands down.

Nothing P.O.D. and Sonny have done can come close to the schizophrenic brilliance of L.D. 50."
"Bracket Day 7: Chad Grey (1) V.S. Sonny Sandoval (4)","Dig both bands. I really enjoyed P.O.D's latest album Murdered Love. And IMO Mudvaynes last album was weak. He is ok in Hellyeah , but being mediocre isnt much to be pleased with. But with all said and done I have to go with Chad Grey. Old Mudvayne is just fucking SIC!"
"Bracket Day 7: Chad Grey (1) V.S. Sonny Sandoval (4)","Chad Grey. Sonny has no vocal range."
"Bracket Day 7: Chad Grey (1) V.S. Sonny Sandoval (4)","Chad for sure. Wish he would ditch hellyeah (nothing against them) and bring back the old school mudvayne.

"/r/numetal what do you think on my bands song?","There is some serious talent and passion here, but horrible engineering. Do you seriously want to know what I think?  I think you guys have heart, but  seek immediate sound engineer help.  Or fail.

Where to start?  Good question.

Search for every music shop in a 250 mile radius, and map them.  Spend a weekend roadtrip getting drunk and laid visiting every shop, and asking one question:  Who's the local engineer of choice?  Tally the votes at the end, then go suck that guy's cock if you have to, but get him to make one badass track with you.  Fail here, go to school.

"/r/numetal what do you think on my bands song?","Yeah this is a recording we did at my house, just guitar drums and vocals, never got round to recording bass. It's a bit of fun doing it, just curious to what people thought. I don't think any of us are committed enough to this band to put that much time and money into it, cheers for the suggestion anyway! :D

We know some local studio's/sound engineers if we wanted to get some decent recordings done, might happen one day. haha"

"/r/numetal what do you think on my bands song?","I don't know what you guys are exactly going for sound wise. I understand this may be a raw recording and all, but it sounded unorganized. I mean, it's very garage-sounding nu-metal.

I'm not hating on it all, honestly. I'm just telling what's going through my head when I listened to this song."

I liked the track 'Monster' at first but was turned off once the vocals kicked in. Need to figure out how to produce his vocals properly."

The rest of the band sounds great, and I wouldn't even go so far as to say that the vocalist is bad, but his style is not at all suited to the music. "

Needs compression as well... seems to go louder in parts? I like the Korn style verse vocals on the 1st track. "

Verses sound like Alice in Chains.  Checked out a couple other songs, and I kinda like them.  Haven't listened to them before.  Name of the band and their image is a little too Emo/trendy for me, but I'm trying to look past that cause I might like the music."
