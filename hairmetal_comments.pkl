VTry online. I got a leather jacket and leopard print tights from Forever 21, and some leather boots with chains and zippers from Rue21.  Everything was extremely cheap. Boots were like 20 bucks, jacket was 25 and tights were under 15. Bandanas are like a buck at Walmart; selection is limited but the basics work just fine. \u000a\u000aWigs you can get at your local halloween/costume place or at Party City. Basic wigs run in the 20-30 dollar range and should last several uses. If you get a packaged wig, make sure to get it out and wear it for a while prior to the event to make sure that it sits right.\u000a\u000aCutting your own tshirts is easy too, just look on youtube. I like to check out hot topic for vintage band tees every time I'm at the mall, then just cut the sleeves off. Unfortunately hot topic is super overpriced, so if anyone knows a better source please let me know.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend eyeliner as well. I use a liquid pen. The pencils work fine but require a little more effort and they are prone to break.

aVcheck the women's section of Wal Mart and just get all the tacky shit you can. \u000a\u000aWhen I was playing metal bands (I'm old) we would go to thrift shops or GoodWill for stage outfits. It wasn't until the late 80s that anyone could afford leather anyway

p227
aVThe guys got talent, that's true, but why did they not use that talent for something real? Now they're just Spinal Tap. There's so many other bands out there that deserves the attention so much more than Steel Panther.
p228
aVI love Steel Panther.  You wouldn't expect a comedy band to be this talented.  "Satchel" is a great guitar player with really good job.  The production on all of their stuff is great.  I hope to see them live some day, I hear their shows are hilarious.  Their music is really good and you've got to love the cheesy lyrics.  Sometimes the lyrics are unbearable though, for example I can't sit through the song "Weenie Ride" - that one is a bit too much for me.  But songs like "Turn out the Lights" are serious blood pumping head bangers.

aVAh sorry I just saw this post now.  Yea they are coming back rumors are saying they might even tour.   They got a new singer (singer from Jailhouse if you heard of them). They are either preforming on the Monsters of Rock cruise or an opening party for it I'm a bit confused on what they are doing with that.   All I know it's fucking awesome!

sVDavid Lee Roth-Goin' Crazy
p482
(lp483
VWhile the opening of the video is... interesting there is no doubt that David Lee Roth flopped after leaving Van Halen. I personally believe that Eat Em' And Smile is a much better album than that of the Sammy Hagar led Van Halen with 5150. Goin' Crazy is a hit that should not be missed off this album, alongside Tobacco Road and Yankee Boy. 
p484
aVHow could you think he flopped?  Skyscraper is an amazing album as well.  Damn Good, Hina and Perfect Timing are some of my favorite DLR songs.  I think Eddie and David had an amazing thing going.  But David's work with Vai just shows that DLR can pull his weight.

VNitro was one of the greatest bands! I don't think they ever could have been super super huge, but the skill level of the band is phenomenal. Michael Angelo Batio is fantastic and he matches up perfectly with Jim Gillete's rocking vocals. Fantastic band
p527
aVI agree, they were definitely a super talented band.  MAB is still touring and just as awesome as ever.  He even had a new quad guitar built (the first one in Nitro was stolen on tour).  Even their lesser known stuff is amazing.  Jim &amp; Mike did an independent album called Proud to be Loud shortly before Nitro was officially formed.  It's on Youtube and its pretty cool.  Mike is one of the fastest + most articulate guitar players out there, every note he plays is very clean, he makes other shredders look sloppy.

p554
aV[deleted]
p555
aVVan Halen is the cookie cutter in which the cookies were created.
p556
aVNo, more like arena rock.
p557
aVI wouldnt necessarily call them arena rock either. They are more of just 80's hard rock.
p558
aVI never know how to categorize these guys, especially with how dissimilar both major eras are.  Van Hagar is more arena rock perhaps.  Classic VH is possibly best called hard rock.  Van Halen is my favorite band!  That's usually my answer

VAhhh, 1991 what a time to live in... sorta. Hair Metal is dying quick and this little known band called Tuff released one of their biggest albums known to date with ~~Nevermind~~ What Comes Around Goes Around. Right off the bat this song "Ruck a Pit Bridge" brings in what this whole album is about, pure hair bliss. While Nirvana got angsty and lead singer Kurt Colbain itched the back of his skull with a shot gun blast, Tuff is still kicking it with their release of What Comes Around Goes Around...Again. If you had told me that Tuff would be still around, I would never have believed it, mostly due to the loud person yelling into my mothers stomach.
