VKamaedzitca is NS :/
p64
aVMuch like ~~Oprich and~~ Temnozor. I'm still not sure why /r/BlackMetal heavily upvotes "Werewolf" when it's not a very black metal song.  \u000a\u000aI'm pleasantly surprised to find Belarusian bands (other than Gods Tower) that sound this good.  It's a considerable improvement on their earlier albums.
p65
aVYeah... which is why I don't support/listen to them anymore. I'm glad Nokturnal Mortum has moved beyond that.
p66
aVOn the other end of the spectrum, RABM has a lot of crust punk elements sorely missing from mainstream black metal, much less NSBM (which chooses RAC for its influences instead).  See: Iskra.\u000a\u000aedit: why did this get downvoted?
p67
aV&gt; Oprich\u000a\u000aOprich is NS? I didn't know that... granted I've not looked much into them besides their split with Chur and first album. There are way too many slavic neo-Nazi bands.. :/
p68
aVActually, they're not.  Never mind.\u000a\u000aStill sound raw and mediocre like one, though.
p69
asVWhat's this song?
p70
(lp71
VDo you maybe mean One More Magic Potion from Ensiferum? It's not an exact match to that tune but it's sorta close at the beginning.
p72
aVEnsiferum is freakin cool, but they arent what I'm looking for when it comes to the song. Think: more metal, more fast paced. I wish I had more of the song to give you, but the first tune of the song is all i can recall right now. Maybe I'll think of it more today, but I only have that tune right now.
p73
aVCan you remember if this bit is towards the start, middle or end of the song?
p74
aVSorry for the late reply...\u000athis bit was in the beginning
p75
aVI've had this tune in my head for the past year, with no relent to my search. please help me r/folkmetal, you're my only hope.
p76
aVAny more hints you could give us?\u000aIs it a folkmetal song actually?
p77
aVI'm not 100% sure on the nationality, but yes, it's a folkmetal song. it belongs in this subreddit. Maybe german or irish...
p78
aVI'm not sure but I sure do wanna hear it. Reminds me just a tiny of one of my favorite folk songs, [*Visa från Utanmya*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMgitKv-78I&amp;feature=kp).\u000a\u000aDo you remember the song having people/someone in the background screaming "la, lalala, lala lala lala la la"?
p79
aVIs the melody played on guitar, synths, or any folk instruments?
p80
aVPipes, electric guitar, drums. 
p81
aVI'm hearing Subway to Sally, but I still can't place the tune.
p82
aVI definitely recognize this tune, but searching through my playlist for an hour revealed nothing. I'll keep an ear out for this tune for the next few days!
p83
aVPlease please please find it... 
p84
aVThis sounds familiar... I have to give it a few more listens...
p85
aVThat sounds almost too familiar... Eluveitie?\u000a\u000a//Yeah, I'm really late to the party.
p86
aVStill looking! 
p87
aVHow about [this?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZLUY44xmAg)
p88
aVI don't have any specific ideas, but potentially it could be Arkona.  I was just thinking about how they have some things of the sort which are played on pipes/flutes.
p89
aVSomething by [Dropkick Murphys?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzF0hHb7xMc)\u000a\u000aSomehow your tune had that Irish vibe.\u000a\u000a^The ^more ^we ^guess ^the ^closer ^we ^get. 
p90
aVNo, they were distinctly foreign. The lyrics were in some germanic language.
p91
aVThe lyrics of Dropkick Murphys are in a Germanic language.
p92
aVTechnically correct - the best kind of correct.
p93
aV^^^It's ^^^foreign ^^^to ^^^me...\u000a\u000aHow about [Wolfchant?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNGFI2bZMQ) Some of their songs are in German.\u000a\u000aHow close is your tune, as in tempo and whatnot?

p115
aVI love this song! The vocals remind me of Goblin Hovel's song "The Forest Walks."
p116
aVI'll have to check it out, The sound quality on youtube isn't great but the albums are both pretty decent. I thought they were kinda like Finntroll a bit but I prefer Leshak. Just personal preferance tho

aVOne of their best songs hands down
p127
aVThis is the song that really started getting me into the genre. 
p128
aVI wonder how many Dutch people are on this subreddit. I'd suspect quite a lot, since Folk Metal is quite popular here. 
p129
aVamsterdam represent!
p130
aVIt's my go to work out song.
p131
aVI remember these guys from when they first rose to fame. It was great seeing them play in the local metal store and it's awesome that they gained so much international fame. Only downside is that they rarely seem to play in the Netherlands any more and spend all their time touring the rest of Europe. Kinda funny to see a Dutch-singing band play more abroad than local. 
p132
aVThey will be at PaganfestXL with Korpiklaani, Turisas and some more bands! So I will be there, too! 
p133
aVYeah, it's an awesome lineup, I'm seriously considering going there. Unfortunately I don't know if I can convince my metal buddies, they're not really appreciative of folk metal.
p134
aVAt this moment they have more Brazillian fans than Dutch ones :P

While I've seen them criticized as "Moonsorrow clones" I love Moonsorrow so having one more band with a similar sound is even better!  \u000a\u000aI do  however think they lack the cohesiveness and melodic unity of Moonsorrow's compositions.

aVMy favorite Heathen Foray songs are [Bifröst](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3EjH5LqIS4) and [Mei Laund](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwT0IjA8QA8). They always give me goosebumps! Especially Mei Laund, which written in Styrian dialect - it's a very personal song for Robert und you can really feel it when you see them live!
p167
aVThat is a really good song you linked. Thank you for introducing us to the song and the band. But it's not really folk metal.

p175
aVCouldn't have gotten worse!\u000a\u000aSource: played in Folkearth.
p176
aVI'd be curious to hear about the experience if you don't mind sharing!
p177
aVYea, sure.\u000a\u000aGot started with them in late 2008/early 2009. Just sent an email saying I write music and play guitar, bass and lute (I don't play lute, never even touched one haha). Ended up playing on and writing music for 3 Folkodia and 2 Folkearth albums. It's a great idea but in practice there was just absolutely ZERO quality control (out of tune and time instruments, just plain bad songs, the works) , which explains why the albums will have a couple great songs and then just absolute crap. A massive undertaking to put together, no doubt, but there was seemingly not a great emphasis on putting out great music.\u000a\u000aHeaps good experience though!
p178
aVThis is definitely spot on. While the out of tune/time stuff has definitely gotten better, my main problem is that I would be given 5+ songs and then expected to have written and recorded them in a week or less which definitely takes some creativity out of some songs. \u000a\u000aLike you said though, the experience is amazing and pretty cool to work with different people all over the world!\u000a\u000aSource: Also played in folkearth since 09 and on this song. 
p179
aVWhat albums were you on? We may have played together haha
p180
aVI played on Viking's Anthem, Sons of the North, Valhalla Ascendant and Balders Lament! 
p181
aVAwesome, my last album was Viking's Anthem (I did Ragnarok and A New Day Rising on that album).
p182
aVThats awesome! Unfortunately I didnt play on either of those songs. I did the drums on Viking's Anthem, Beasts from the Blizzards and There is no Death. 
p183
aVIronically the drummer from my band did vocals on Beasts from the Blizzards!

I beg you to hide the ancient commands of ancestors, I beg you to hide them from an evil eye of enemy in the thickets of holy forests.\u000a\u000aMy heart was dying down when I said words hardly breathing.

aVEh, I think Fallout &gt; Elder Scrolls. The combat is Skyrim is terrible, the world was bland, and half the characters had identical voices.
p201
aVHalf of that is true of Fallout also. The world isn't just trees like Elder Scrolls is but most characters do also have the same voice actors.
p202
aVI haven't actually noticed in Fallout. All the named characters have different voices. The combat isn't great, but it's overall better than Skyrim. The world seems a bit more varied as well.

p207
aVTook too long to do what, exactly?\u000a\u000aAs it is, I greatly prefer the 2nd anyway. There are a lot of improvements that make the game smoother to play. (Also a lot of bugs but there are good patches out there)\u000a\u000aIt's one of the few games I consistently replay every year or two.
p208
aVEverything. Menus weren't intuitive and took a while, travel was hazardous and made for a waste of time if you didn't have everything prepared beforehand, combat took quite a while... everything took quite a while. I know it's a different style of game, but it didn't hold my attention very well.

p221
aVThey're been on my top 3 since I saw them live. That was before I even listened to any of their songs. 
p222
aVI would love to see them live!
p223
aVI'm curious... I love this album and evidently so does everyone else :D but it seems to be some what of a consensus that it's a bit asian sounding? Though it doesn't sound asian to me I'd be curious for timestamps of these asian-sounding bits :D
p224
aVCheck out [this video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl6CmmerR8c) You get to hear a lot of the individual tracks to Sons of Winter and Stars, there are definitely a few Asian elements in there. \u000a\u000aAlso, if you're curious, I believe the reason you are being downvoted is because Wintersun isn't really considered folk metal. I personally think it fits here as it is very folk-like, but not many agree.\u000a\u000aEdit: Video was taken down, replaced the link with one that works.
p225
aVwhat would you call wintersun?
p226
aVMelodic death metal.
p227
aVInteresting! I am relatively new to the metal world, so please forgive my dumb questions. I'm I guess familiar with symphonic black metal (people like Dimmu Borgir) and can understand the difference in vocal style between Wintersun and Dimmu but are there other factors? \u000a\u000aI am often miscategorizing bands and would love to get better at it so I can not only discuss them intelligently but also find new bands :). I often will look at metalarchives.com but never thought to for Wintersun and, sure enough, they agree with you :).
p228
aVBecause of the vocals? Stylistically it's almost nothing like death metal, besides the vocals, which are more in line with black metal if anything.\u000a\u000aI'd describe Wintersun as progressive power metal with harsh vocals.
p229
aVI'd say it depends a lot on which album you're talking about. I do think the cover a lot of sub-genres though and I don't really think of them as a **pure** death metal.
p230
aV[deleted]
p231
aVwould blind guardian also be considered melodic death metal?
p232
aVNo, Blind Guardian is a power metal band.
p233
aVFinally got home and had a chance to listen to a few songs, I agree completely.
p234
aVI have no idea, I don't have access to Youtube or any streaming media here at work so I couldn't say without hearing them. If you want to call them folk metal then fine, call them that if you wish. Nobody will agree with you, but that's your decision.
p235
aVMelodic Power Folk Symphonic Neo-Classical Death Progressive Metal, which is utterly ridiculous so I just refer to them as "Awesome."
p236
aVYou left out Majestic! =P
p237
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_metal Evidently Wikipedia thinks they're folk metal and metal archives thinks they're Melodic Death Metal http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Wintersun/22813 lol. I would take the later as a better reference but I think it's telling that Wikipedia also was misinformed.
p238
aV&gt; I think it's telling that Wikipedia also was misinformed.\u000a\u000aOn their page they are listed as melodic death metal, power metal, and folk metal. I'd say they are close enough to folk metal to deserve a mention, they just sort of skirt the line. Sort of like Ensiferum. Then again I suppose it really depends on who you ask and which album you're talking about because the two out now are pretty different from each other. Anyways, this is one of those instances where Wikipedia may be *technically* wrong but can't really be faulted for it, a lot of people do feel they are folk metal, or at least really close.\u000a
p239
aVI can see that for sure. Their first album is great too but Time is one of my all-time favorite albums and was from the moment I pressed play ;). \u000a
p240
aVlol really? What genre are they in? I'm new to Wintersun ;)
p241
aVAlso, I can cope with downvotes ;) I'm not here for karma and figured people who hadn't heard it might enjoy it. :D
p242
aVHe used a lot of the Asian instruments in the east west quantum leap RA library.  Things like shamisen, koto, and erhu.  There are also a lot of Japanese melodies based on some pentatonic scales.  A big influence for the album is the sound track from "crouching tiger hidden dragon"
p243
aVInteresting! I didn't know that :) Thanks!
p244
aVYou are welcome!  I use the same library, its pretty fantastic!  It's pretty astounding how much work Jari put into the articulations of each instrument to give them such a dynamic tone
p245
aVIt's really remarkable. Until fairly recently (maybe 6 or so months ago) I had no idea at all the sheer amount of talent and effort and skill many metal musician have in so many areas of making music. It's astounding :).

aVNot my favorite song from the album but the video was good. I wonder why metal blade has it unlisted?
p257
aVBeats me.  I'm just glad they didn't rape this video with CG the way they did to Father of the Wolf.
p258
aVLiv's and Heri's voices blend pretty well, but other than that the song and video are both pretty forgettable. Far and away not the best song on the album.
p259
aVWho decided this was the song to produce a video for? This is not that people listen to Tyr for. It is cool and all. The song is OK. But, this is not the Tyr I expect after they released one of the better albums of 2013.
p260
aVI'm assuming it's to go along with the imagery on the cover and in the photo shoots.  And to have Liv be a part of it.  I would have used the same stylistic setting but done Lady of the Slain, with the entire band up on that arm headbanging.
p261
aVMost of the songs work with the imagery on the cover. 'Into the Sky,' 'Fánar Burtur Brandaljóð,' and 'Lady of the Slain' would have been the more appropriate picks in that regard. The last of these would have been the best choice for a music video, imo.
p262
aVWhat happened to the band that Held the Heathen Hammer High?
p263
aVMaybe that was a metaphor for having an erection?
p264
aVIt's the same band. You guys do realise that musicians have to evolve and experiment right? Heri has an entire side project that sounds more like Ragnarok due to the fact that touring with 12-15 minute songs doesn't work.

p275
aVI dig it, I'd like to hear more bands with that sort of folk instrument. Greek, middle eastern ?\u000a\u000aEDIT: Googled them &amp; they're Greek. I thought it sounded sort of Xena like. 
p276
aVAlthough in the link text I said "this one specific" song, actually the whole album this song is from, Aealo, has a lot of other songs that also have this sort of sound.  \u000a\u000aTo a lesser extent there is also the odd folk (IMO) element in one or two songs on albums before and after that one also, e.g. [Nemesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdWerqw0TYU) on Theogonia, [Cine Iubeste Si Lasa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTGUm_LEVB8) on Kata Ton Daimona Eaytoy.  \u000a\u000aTo me, this is interesting to share because I think many people would assume from the band's name + not having heard the music that the band is probably black metal, vs. not expecting them to have this kind of sound.\u000a\u000aRe: "that sort of folk instrument": Personally I too would like to hear more of this instrumentation and/or female singing style.  But the only other example that comes right to my mind is from another Greek band, Preemptive Strike.  This band is NOT metal - they are industrial aggrotech - but some of their songs have "ethnic" sounds / progressions that strangely remind me of Rotting Christ.  Best examples are [TALOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RttZdk9kqp8) and [Hubris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sFGJ7nialY).  As an added bonus, they are still heavy (albeit not in a "metal" way) and are singing about Greek mythology in many cases.  I got a few of my buddies to listen to this band by calling them "Rotting Christ: the dance remixes" - LOL.\u000a\u000aAll somewhat tangential to "actual" folk metal, but I'm hoping some folks enjoy it nonetheless.

For more Russian folk metal, you could try [SatanaKozel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDlXbcOX0tY), [Kalevala](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLwp-USgu7U), [Grai](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gMCxCI9IBw), [Nevid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOFfOJkKb8) and [Troll Bends Fir](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew9yVyO2UOY).\u000a\u000aFor a more atmospheric or darker sound, try the already mentioned bands [Finsterforst(!)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvdBgtepAY4) and [Falkenbach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA5nN65B_eg), as well as [Myrkgrav](http://myrkgrav.bandcamp.com/track/de-to-spellemenn-2013-edition) and maybe some [Manegarm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB1T_yCvGFg), [Bran Barr](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlSELoBVVJs) and [Fir Bolg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnsBNy04W8).\u000a\u000aAlso [Dalriada](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_FJEoXwkNE) from Hungary. \u000a\u000aAnother band you might enjoy is [Wintersun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWxLQDzJOU), their vocalist and mastermind has been part of Ensiferum for their first two albums.

p304
aVprobably just a money thing, they think they wont sell enough tickets in the south or something.
p305
aVStory time. \u000a\u000aThe last time Ensiferum came through Texas it was roughly 4-5 years ago in a tour with Fintroll. I live in S.A. and of course there wasn't a tour date here but there was one in Austin. Ok awesome slight road trip. Well it was February and as it often does in February in Texas, there was a slight ice storm the night before. I thought, "no big deal, these warriors from the north should shrug at this slight ice  when compared to their homeland". NOPE. Show cancelled. Fuck. Havent come around since.

aVI don't know much about Enisferum, but as for Korpiklaani, I can give you some of my favorites:\u000a\u000a[Wooden Pints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoRUpKnaOHs)\u000a\u000a[Keep on Galloping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aENHuVhBoz8)\u000a\u000a[Hunting Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x26u6t4jaY)\u000a\u000a[Ievan Polkka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a247R3mNs5A)\u000a\u000a[Metsalle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz05MslfJ9k)\u000a\u000a[Pine Woods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEVJFSUjvNo)\u000a\u000a[Old Tale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5haKBACi6E)\u000a\u000a[Korpiklaani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoaLUHmfSp4)
p324
aVKorpiklaani I don't tend to care too much for their Finnish lyric songs, but here's a list of my favourite:\u000a\u000a"Brings Us Pints Of Beer" was my first song and still my favourite\u000a"Vodka" is another fun song and popular\u000a"Rauta" is their most popular song I think. It's Finnish but very catchy. There is an English version if it that I recommend avoiding \u000aUnder the Sun\u000aTequila\u000aHappy Little Boozer\u000aIevan Polkka (also Finnish but catchy, again, avoid English version)\u000a\u000aThey're a very party / fun band.\u000a\u000aEnsiferum is more about battle and Viking stuff. I'm not as familiar with those but here are my most memorable:\u000a\u000aWanderer (somewhat different than some of the others, probably my favourite)\u000aIn My Sword I Trust\u000aVictory Song\u000aBattle Song\u000aSword Chant\u000a \u000a(See the theme? :p)
p325
aVFuck, I'll probably be in a shithole in the middle of nowhere when this comes close enough!
p326
aVWait there is a PaganfestXL im going to next month in The Netherlands. It's got Korpiklaani,  Turisas, Heidevolk, Wintersun and some more.\u000a\u000aWhat do you mean no Paganfest?
p327
aVNo Paganfest in USA this year. I've been going to them for years but this year they aren't doing one over here. 
p328
aVI wonder if there's a relation to the canceled Paganfest and this tour. Like did they decide to go anyway? Or was it canceled because of this tour?\u000a\u000aI was heartbroken to hear there was no Paganfest this year but this definitely makes up for it.
p329
aVOkay yeah we didnt have one last year but do have one this year.
p330
aVNope they announced on their Facebook page that there will be no 2015 Paganfest America.

VI think 2014 was a great year for folk metal, my Top 3 are probably\u000a\u000a* [Arkona - Yav](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT9DlXAONEw)\u000a\u000aSo completely different than their previous releases, with a less folky and more progressive approach that probably needs a few listens to sink in.\u000a\u000a* [Stworz - Có\u017c po \u017cyznych ziemiach\u200b.\u200b.\u200b.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjE_kVvK04w)\u000a\u000aReally authentic polish band with a great mix of folk/black metal.\u000a\u000a* [Saor - Aura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooEcGi3CmSs)\u000a\u000aI'm simply in love with that atmosphere...
p357
aVSaor, Aura is soo expansive. I can't tell exactly what they're mixing but it sounds pretty awesome.
p358
aVMy top 3:\u000a\u000a* [Folkstone - In caduta Libera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChDHu_jB-g8)\u000a* [Skalmold - Med vaettum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWRPB-3o9TE)\u000a* [Tengger cavalry - Ancient call ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_yrQTfUcA)\u000a\u000a

p360
aV[Equilibrium - Erdentempel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOuL3VY8qnLo4clHnQAl_v0LFKmUxepmh)\u000a\u000a[Eluveitie - Origins](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_hlB5_-KSXefS2Dt0gT1tjpraBm3F4E_)\u000a\u000a[Tengger Cavalry - Ancient Call](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw4EQU5C8ZCLxMPuAaqwahI7hC-uZ6ufV)\u000a\u000a

aVNice\u000a\u000aI haven't listened to Eluveitie but many like this album.
p362
aVI also saw them live with Arkona &amp; Skalmold two weeks ago :)
p363
aVI feel like its because it just sounds so crisp. Agh, I cant wait to get listen to this on my headphones later.
p364
aVEluveitie's my favorite band and in my opinion Origins is the best album they've put out.
p365
aVI didn't keep up with new releases a lot, but I was very happy that Elvenking and Mago de Oz put out solid albums this year for the first time in ages.
p366
aVFor me, it has to go to Trollfest's [Kaptein Kaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faV-_t_f_V0). \u000a\u000a

aVDidn't keep up with new releases like I told myself I would (failed new year's resolution), But I thoroughly enjoyed Alestorm's and Trollfest's new releases this year. Metsatoll did a great job with their latest as well. 
p369
aVEquilibrium - *Erdentempel* \u000a\u000aAlestorm - *Sunset on the Golden Age*\u000a\u000aI personally was not impressed by the Eluveitie album as I've mentioned in the past. :P\u000a
p370
aVI guess they're technically power metal, but I still have to give it to [Falconer - Black Moon Rising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAURLVemHnA)
p371
aVGotta be [Elvenking - The Pagan Manifesto] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8fT4nOICKo) for me.
p372
aVMy number one is easily Origins by Eluveitie. There are no other folk metal bands that really sound anything like Eluveitie and in my opinion, they get better with every album. \u000a\u000aI've been listening to them since Spirit and over the years I've watched them lose some of their folk sound in favor of heavier and more technical guitar and drum work and I did love old and new Eluveitie.\u000a\u000aOrigins really is the most fitting name for this album because they really found a perfect balance between old and new. It's their most folk sounding album since Slania (Not counting Evocation) but it's also their heaviest and most technical album yet.
p373
asVRusskaja: "Russian Turbo Polka!" Not exactly folk metal but... you be the judge.

VCool song!  Might be a better fit in /r/ska but glad you posted

p377
aVCheck out the circle pit they get going to [Psycho Traktor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADCvlqc_6ws). Metal enough for me!\u000a\u000a(no "folk" aspect at all at all, but if you like metal-meets-ska, check out [South Central Skankers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duzs2uKHm0A)).

aV[deleted]
p387
aVI think Lumsk is on the edge of being metal. It's more beautiful, enchanting music than folkmetal, but has enough influences to go in the proggressive folkmetal boat (as if Týr got a female singer and started playing calmer).
p388
aVWhen they only play the grandspa's guitars, I'd say. 
p389
aVDalriada's later albums fit quite well into your "metal folk" category. Arkona too at some points - especially with their albums Ot Serdtsa K Nebu and Goi, Rode, Goi! I'd say.
p390
aVNothing to contribute here except to say that this is exactly my taste too, and thanks to the comments I've found a bunch of new bands :).  Thanks!
p391
aVFolkodia's album Forgotten Lore fits into this category. Only that album though, the rest of their stuff is standard folk metal.
p392
aVThey're not metal, but give bardic form a listen! Acoustic duo who play folk metal influenced acoustic folk music 
p393
aVFolkception?

p397
aVOne album doesn't really make a band a certain genre though, and OP asked "Can you think of any bands that might fall into the Folk first and foremost side of Folk Metal?"\u000a\u000aAnd even then, I would just classify that album as folk... not "metal folk."

asVTyr Interview. Anyone have any questions?
p400
(lp401
VI would like to know if they ever intend on doing more on the lines of "Eric the Red" or "Ragnarok" again composition-wise, I really like "The Edge" in particular.
p402
aVHa, that's exactly what I was going to ask myself.\u000a\u000aI wouldn't expect a full album, but a song or two on each new album would be awesome. When I first heard By the Light of the Northern Star, I loved it... but with 3 albums of that now, I really miss the Eric the Red style.
p403
aVCould you perhaps elaborate a bit? Don't get me wrong, "The Edge" is one of my favorite songs of theirs, the song that actually got me into Tyr in the first place. The only problem is, unless you can be more specific, the answer is probably as simple as that Heri's song writing has changed. I just want to make sure I do your question justice.\u000a\u000a
p404
aVDamn, sorry I'm late with this, but I guess the thing would be songwriting and album progression. There were choruses, but the verses were diverse.  This is opposed to their more recent songwriting style which relies on catchy repeated riffs, and less on dynamic song structure.  I still like Týr, but damn do I wish they would go back to the more progressive song structure.  It added a whole new element of storytelling that you just can't grasp with the verse-prechorus-chorus-verse style with similar verses.  I guess the best way, from a songwriting perspective, to describe it would be that the chorus resolved and transitioned the verses rather than the verses leading up to the chorus.  More emphasis on verse and other structures or whatever you want to call it.
p405
aVNo worries. I still was able to ask, so you'll have to see what Gunnar said about it!
p406
aVI was able to get an answer for you from Gunnar.\u000a\u000aCheck out my interview tonight by listening live through the links I provided in the post body. I'll also be linking it once I've been able to upload it.

aVIf there's any chances of them playing songs from the first few albums when on tour. The last few tours haven't had enough :|\u000a\u000a\u000aDon't get me wrong, the new stuff is great-- I just leave a little disappointed when I don't hear anything off *Eric the Red*, *Land* or *Ragnarok*.
p421
aVI'll see about asking him, though I've asked him this before. Unfortunately it is a matter of playing new songs, a lack of time, and playing songs for both old and new fans. A song like Land, even though Heri said it's the one song he wishes he could ever play live, will most likely never be played on tour. On this tour, I can tell you its all about time--they only have five songs to play since they're an opener, and since they have a new album out, those will be mostly new songs. I will be sure to include your interest though when I ask him about an upcoming headlning tour, which will hopefully be soon. 
p422
aVThat makes sense. Thanks for the response!\u000a\u000aI look forward to hearing what they might have to say.
p423
aVHeri said that about Land?  That's my very favorite song of all time.  I'm glad that he even wants to play it, because maybe things will happen someday...
p424
aVI'm pretty sure once they get longer sets again, they'll start adding stuff like Ramund Hin Unge and Sinklars Visa back.
p425
aVOh they will. Gunnar mentions in the interview that they are looking to come back in (hopefully) a year or so and play for more like an hour and half, than a half hour like they did this time, hoping to include much more old stuff in their set. Check out my interview tonight! I've linked listening methods in the post body.

p430
aV1. Why does Heri Joensen go under the guise of "fervently Asatru" when he's actually atheist?\u000a2. When will Tyr (or any folk metal band for that matter) tour anywhere near the south in the US
p431
aVThe touring in the South thing has actually come up in other interviews I've done with bands like Tyr. Apparently there just isn't enough pull down there to get bands to tour there. \u000a\u000aedit: I forgot to log in an reply with my show's account...
p432
aVI think part of that is just connections and awareness. For years lots of metal bands skipped Brisbane Australia, just doing Sydney/Melbourne.\u000a\u000aLast few years had Moonsorrow, Korpiklaani, Eluveitie, Russian Circles, Animals as Leaders, Kvelertak and others touring. Often attached to major festivals, and usually perform at same 2-3 venues.
p433
aVI just went to a show they played in Dallas on the 11th of this month
p434
aVI was there, front row.  Met Heri afterwards, too!
p435
aVHell yeah! My boyfriend and I were in the best box seats available, had to get box since my spine is fractured and it is really unsafe for me to be in a closely-packed crowd like that. I got to give Terji a hug and it was kind of the best moment of my life
p436
aVYou probably saw me in the front row, fisting pumping and head banging like crazy while all the high school Children of Bodom fans stood there like wtf?
p437
aVI think it's a way for them, and other bands, to distance themselves from Christianity because they view it as an evil that was forced upon the people to subjugate them, which is arguably the reason a lot of the Scandinavian countries were converted nearing the end of the Viking age, and also because it threatened their cultural heritage.
p438
aVHeri has never come across as Asatru at all.  People get confused because Tyr is a bit more openly atheist than most bands, but you'll hear Johan Hegg and Sammi Hinkka saying exactly the same things about old pagan religions.  There aren't any major bands in folk metal (that I am aware of) that are actually Asatru or Wiccan or anything like.\u000a\u000aDefinition of 'heathen', according to some random online dictionary: an unconverted individual of a people that do not acknowledge the God of the Bible; a person who is neither a Jew, Christian, nor Muslim
p439
aV[deleted]
p440
aVUnfortunately I wasn't able to interview Heri this time around. You should still check out my interview tonight with Gunnar, using the links I've provided in the post body to listen live.
p441
aVHe doesn't. He uses the Viking Myths and Folklore as metaphor, They are cultural heritage and he doesn't believe in supressing cultural heritage for religious reasons.\u000a\u000aAlso Tyr just played Atlanta with Death angel and Cob.
p442
aVAsk him how Heljaryega is coming along.  For everyone who misses Tyr's old Ragnarok sound, try out some of Heri's [side project band Heljaryega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BfZPy3wMeo).  It has all the proggy elements of old Tyr with the higher production value and super intricate melodies of new Tyr.\u000a\u000aTyr is still my favorite band, but I expect that as Heljareyga's discography increases, they will usurp that position.\u000a\u000aAlso, Tyr's new drummer Amon Djurhuss Elinsgaard is the drummer for Heljareyga.
p443
aVUnfortunately I did not interview Heri so I couldn't ask about Heljareyga. Last time they were here though I was able to interview Heri and ask him about Heljareyga: https://soundcloud.com/metaloxide/interview-heri-joensen\u000a\u000a

I never thought of it that way, but it's definitely a vocal style that seemed to appear first on Slovo.\u000a\u000aI secretly wish Masha did more of these high growls/shrieks like on Bol'no Mne for example. Or even screams like on Krasota Dolzhna Umeret by Rossomahaar... aaand that beautiful slavic folk singing style! Oh her vocal range is simply amazing.
p463
aVOh, I definitely agree. I loved those vocals as well. As to her range... could go on for ages about that. xd \u000a\u000aSpeaking of Krasota dolzhna umeret- I also really love all her non-Arkona work- Gori, gori yasno in Bloody Mary, Volchia with Varg, Dumi moi - zarnitsy dalnie with Alkonost, the songs with Svarga, etc... the album with Nargathrond.
p464
aVHah! I know Gori, gori yasno from Masha's 1997 Acoustic album, but not the [Krovavaya Meri version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcpYjapIxzQ) - cheers for that :) \u000a\u000aYes, her whole work is just brilliant! I also love the fact that she does so many collaborations with different musicians. It's always interesting to hear her voice in a different setting than Arkona or Nargathrond... yea I could go on for ages about that too ;D 
p465
aV&gt;Hah! I know Gori, gori yasno from Masha's 1997 Acoustic album, but not the Krowawaja Meri version - cheers for that :) \u000a\u000aNo problem at all :D There was an upload on the Rossomahaar forum that had that, her 1997 album, Na dalney stantsii soydu the "hidden" track from Neizbezhnost as its own track, and 3 songs with 2 other bands- two with "Eu121" ("Pogonya" and... a cover of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme "Heroes in a Half Shell" xd) and one with "E.S.T."

VI like it as an album, but don't like it as a Turisas album (where I compare everything to Varangian Way.)
p473
aVThis.  I was introduced to Turisas via SUAF, and this album still doesn't sound like Turisas.  However, as an album, it is fantastic.  If I don't compare it to the others, this is a very strong album, albeit more of a power metal sound that folk metal.
p474
aVI like to think of it as a Turisas Rock Opera.\u000a\u000aWe Ride Together is their big closing number, in a story about how they used to raid the metal scene until the band broke up due to stylistic differences, but years later each member found their true calling and reunited as an act on Broadway!
p475
aVThis album is definitely growing on me.  It seems that Turisas has forged their own sound that isn't really folk anymore, but definitely still battle metal inspired.  In fact, the only problems I really have with it at this point are the GOD AWFUL 'Run, Bhang-Eater, Run!' and that weird high-pitched 'March of the Varangian Guard' chorus in 'No Good Story Ever Starts With Drink...'

VI guess I'm a little late to the party but I'll recommend Dalriada, Skalmold, Irminsul, Metsatoll and Heljareyga.  Dalriada sounds like Eluveities but is (IMO) better, and older.  Skalmold is like Amon Amarth infused with Icelandic folk, Iriminsul is a really underground folk death band from Sweden I found in the Metal Archives on random band search, Metsatoll is an Estonian group that sounds pretty unique and has a great show, and Heljareyga is the prog-folk-power side project of Tyr's Heri Joensen.\u000a\u000aSorry I'd give some links but I'm in a hurry now.
p508
aVWith Tyr you can't go wrong with\u000a[Hold the Heathen Hammer High](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu2bgwcv43o)
p509
aVI absolutely love primordials two recent albums to the nameless dead and redemption at the puritan's hand. \u000aAlso check out darkest era if you like those two albums 
p510
aVThank you, I will give them two a listen :)
p511
aVI think for Heidevolk the best song they've made is probably [Het Wilde Heer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fPpDhdu_54) followed by [Reuzenmacht](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRN9NpYHz1c), these songs feel so powerful, partially due to the strong vocals.\u000a\u000aThey've also got some great instrumental ones: [Alvermans Wraak](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daTaOJwCG3o), [Dageraad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V5wtSzH2HA)\u000a\u000aAs for the best album, I'd have to go with Walhalla Wacht, almost exclusively great songs. Batava, their latest album is sounding too much like regular standard metal for my tastes.
p512
aVThanks, i'm not really an instrumental kind of guy, but i'll give the other two a look :)
p513
aVDefinitely the more popular bands of those (so maybe better to start with?) are Eluveitie, Arkona, Agalloch, Tyr and maybe Falkenbach.  Then I'd say maybe Equilibrium (although the more I listen to these people the more I personally absolutely dislike them.  I mean come on, the song Unbesiegt off of Sagas is an absolute joke) and Heidevolk, etc, well you get the gist!  Here are my personal thoughts:\u000a\u000aEluveitie:  Their demo Ven is really good (not the re-recorded more recent version!) and definitely this one is the most "metal" check the song lament!  Their most famous album is Slania.  Most "folkey" album is Evocation 1 -the Arcane Dominion.  Personally I love the Slania - folk medley song because it is a simple rendition of most riffs from the Slania album and no "Inis Mona" ^^\u000a\u000aArkona: Everyone listens to Goi, Rode, Goi! which is still arguably their best release.  I love the song Rus off of I think their first album ever (it's a bit slower).  \u000a\u000aSvartsot:  I have the Mulmets Viser album from them and the "Pa Odden..." song of that is definitely that catchiest song of the album and the whole album was the starting place for me for this band.\u000a\u000aHope this helped a bit! The best way to know any band? Just listen to the full album, not that hard to do as you're doing something else and just think of what you like and don't like about it.  If you're not sure where to start with a band, listen to some sample tracks from each album to decide which looks the most promising first.  The decision must ultimately be up to you of what to listen to and what to like of what you listen!  \u000a\u000aChecking out that songs a band often plays live can help a lot to know which songs are considered more relevant if that's what you're looking for.  \u000a\u000aAlso I think a lot of folk metal is not as "album oriented" as we may like where there really are just a few decent songs on each album rather than the whole bands discography being relevant (well that's at least how I feel about Equilibrium haha)
p514
aVThank you for the in-depth reply, I have some serious listening to work on now :P\u000a\u000aSlavsia rus is the only track I know by arkona and is perhaps one of my favourite folk metal songs. I love the style so much :) Infact if anyone could perhaps suggest more music in the style of that song, that would be excellent. 
p515
aVNo problem!  I will put some links to make it easier:\u000a\u000aSlavsia Rus is a good song!  Rus is actually a different track which you will probably like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvAlav12a50\u000a\u000aAnd since you haven't listened to Goi, Rode, Goi! (everyone must know this track, haha) Here ya go: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR4LVp9wjN4\u000a\u000aAnd maybe you will also like "Faun" because of their folk and vocal styles.  They are not metal but still a very good group:\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwmkR7H0UNs\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKF3ps4nH2o
p516
aVOut of the bands you requested help with my 2 favorites are Heidevolk and Equilibrium.  I really think all their albums are solid.  I would start with their first ones and go from there.  I also like Tyr alot.  \u000a\u000aAs far as the others I am also a casual listener.  I do agree with earlier posts about Arkona's Goi Rode Goi as being a must listen.  My personal favorite is Na Moey Zemle.  It is an epic 15 minute track sung in 5 different languages.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSDIbjjGDJ8\u000a\u000aI would also recommend checking out Dalriada, especially their last 2 albums.  Lastly, get Krampus' EP Shadows of Time.  Great album, unfortunatley their more recent music has gone in a different direction.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UteDFpZ7Bys
p517
aVUpvote for Faun. Check out Schrei es in de winde, you'll recognize the melody immediately if you listen to Eluveitie. ;)\u000a\u000aReally though, Faun is great. Especially if you really liked Eluveitie unplugged. Even the guy from Subway To Sally  was on two of Faun's songs. \u000a\u000aAlso I suck at German spelling!

asVSo whats everyone's thoughts on the new Tyr album?
p568
(lp569
VI think Tyr made a great Tyr album. It wasn't a stretch like The Lay of Thrym, influenced more by current events than the past and losing Tyr's progressive style more and more. In Heri's own words, Tyr have been becoming a little more mainstream with each album, explaining why many of the songs on The Lay of Thrym were meant for newer fans more than older. As an older fan, I was not so impressed by The Lay of Thrym--don't get me wrong, it wasn't a terrible album, just not their best. While I don't think Valkyrja is their best, I still see more of older Tyr in it than Thrym. It's a good old fashioned, epic Tyr concept album, following the epic story of a man who leave's his life behind to die gloriously in battle. In many of the songs, you hear both slower progressive parts and a faster, heavier melodic parts, appeasing both old and new fans simultaneously. I love this album!
p570
aVI really loved Grindavísan, Another Fallen Brother, Hel Hath No Fury and Lady of the Slain. The cover of Cemetery Gates was pretty fun too. \u000a\u000aOverall, I found it to be on about the same level of Lay of Thrym- didn't disappoint, didn't blow me away. As far as new albums go, it was a success. Definitely worth the purchase.
p571
aVThis is definitely not quite on topic, but I'd rather put it here than start a whole thread for it.\u000a\u000aI am *extremely* into Folk Metal, hence why I'm subscribed to this subreddit, as I'm sure all of you are.  I love all the same stuff the Folk Metal community loves for the most part, but I've never been able to get into Tyr for some reason.  Same with Turisas.  I don't see much hope for me ever liking Turisas, but I definitely think I could be into some of Tyr's stuff.  Can someone recommend me some songs of theirs similar to Ramund hin Unge?  I really love that style, but I haven't been through their whole discography, since I'm turned off by the majority of their stuff.  I checked out the single from the new album when it came out, and wanted to force myself to like it since so many of you guys do, but I just wasn't too impressed.  It just seems strange to me that the people who love all the same stuff I do are really into a band that I feel like I just don't get.  I'd love if someone could help me out by pointing to me to some of their best songs!  Thanks.
p572
aVGet yourself Eric the Red. It is my favourite album of theirs by a long stretch. Songs like that one, and especially [Regin Smidur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8klzhW6DVE) are what got me into the band. Honestly: I don't know how many times I've watched the video for that song on loop. Not only did it sell me on Tyr, but also on Folk Metal as a whole. (I clicked the link off a Korpiklaani video and it change my world)
p573
aVTry [The Lay of Thrym](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itZPFAc7CIA) I share the same sentiments as you and this is the one song by them I've been able to get into. It's fucking awesome
p574
aVWell I'm similar in that I really haven't been able to understand this band's appeal. I really really try to like them but the music just doesn't engage me. Their live performance was very enjoyable but other than that, I just can't say I get it. \u000a\u000a\u000aThough, I am different from you in the fact that I like Turisas. 
p575
aVI can see how they'd be a lot of fun live.  I just don't see anything too special or original about them.\u000a\u000aAnd what Turisas songs would you recommend?  I like a couple, but it seems bland to me for the most part.  I saw them live with Arkona and Alestorm on Paganfest a couple years back, but I just wasn't into it.  I caught the rag he used to wipe his facepaint on though.  That was cool.  I gave it to the dude next to me who was a huge fan.  He had his face painted and yelled all the words to every song.  He gave me a hug, haha.  Good ol' metalhead brotherhood.
p576
aVWell, there's the classic [To Holmgard and Beyond](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFBIr3Vx16w). Some of my other favourites are [Hunting Pirates](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFBIr3Vx16w) and [In The Court of Jarisleif.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K8SP-xoQiY) I don't know, I just get a really unique vibe from these guys. They're not my favourite band by any means but bland would be the last word I'd use to describe them (though I wouldn't hesitate to use it describe Tyr). \u000a\u000aEdit: Don't waste your time with Turisas2013.
p577
aVHey, I love Progmetal, but do not like Dream Theatre, BTBAM, or Protest the Hero. Sometimes your ears are going to disagree with the majority, but thats okay.
p578
aVOnly liked a handful of Tyr's stuff before, but I like more or less every song off the entire album. I know saying this is sacrilege in metal but I think moving towards a more catchy mainstream sound helped them. A lot of the songs are just solid headbangers and I think a lot of their older stuff suffered from being overly proggy - I just couldn't get into it.
p579
aVSurprisingly i already have four songs stuck in my head on my second listen, which is pretty good.  I REALLY like nation though, because, like The Edge, it shifts from english to faroese which makes me happy.

aVIf they planning to do an Australian tour in the near future. (Dying to see them live)
p591
aVI'd love if you asked them about the evolution of their sound.\u000a\u000afor example, their demo and first album relied very heavily on atmosphere.  Some of their songs even boarder lined soundscapes.  Then, when sagas came out, they began to rely more on the riff, but still retained a healthy atmosphere.  With Rekreatur, they began to sound closer to a heavy metal band with folk influences which was further solidified with Erdentemple. \u000a\u000aNot that this is a bad thing, I'm just super interested to here what influenced the change.

VFor lovers of the pipes. Goth-pop [Jones of Arc] with Scotland's finest. \u000aThe pipe action starts at 2:36 mins in...  So u gotta be patient and 'endure' the build-up.\u000aThis is hardcore serious Goth-philosophical rock, with a 'message'. An 'artful' message from the great Homer. Go to /r/bagpipes subreddit for more info. The song is worth a listen because it showcases the blood-stirring pipes in a  rock setting, usually ignored by ALL rock bands. 
p614
aVwrong sub
p615
aVI must admit I posted here on spec....I'd never heard of 'folkmetal'...then the tune received 10 upvotes so today I listened to Dread Crew of Oddwood--Battle Metal...(natural and powerful sound 'art'). I think this particular tune by Jones of Arc fits in here (i.e medieval, bagpipes etc) but his other tunes certainly wouldn't.
p616
aVWell, there was about 15 seconds of decent bagpipes in that. I could certainly do without the rest though. I'll just leave it at that.
p617
aVYou're a hard one...go to bagpipes reddit /r/bagpipes to see my philosophy outline re-lyrics..plus the 'vocal' chorus...how about those trumpets???....ha..ha..didn't like the chipmunk?..least he's not bullshittin ya.
p618
aVSorry but wtf.
p619
aVDon't be sorry. Get a bottle of cream sherry and follow these instructions. Pour a full cup (250ml)..drink it, then fill a second. Play the song....You've got Roman trumpets, fanfare trumpets, virtuoso snare drumming, military bagpipes...and a SERIOUS chipmunk!! How original do u want a muso to be? Avant-Garde? (i.e out of key/out of tempo?)\u000aI promise if you follow the above instructions, and ABSORB the sherry and opening lyrics while waiting for the 1st chorus to kick in...you will be imbued with more COURAGE and WISDOM, which of course was the song's intent.
p620
aVBest performed in a velvet jacket with inner lacing comfortable enough to to compared to your finest set of pajamas.

asVrecommendations for bands like Skalmold?
p652
(lp653
VIf you haven't heard of Metsatoll, check them out, but they're pretty popular so you probably have.  \u000a\u000aFalkenbach is in a similar vein, as it's essentially folk black with clean vocals.  XIV Dark Centuries is pretty good, very folky black metal with kinda the same vibe as Skalmold.  \u000a\u000aI also like King of Asgard, they're pretty typical viking black metal, as well as Abinchova, which is similar except way more folky.  \u000a\u000aEinherjer has a similar vibe instrumentally, but the vocals are very different.  That's all I can think of right now.
p654
aVHeidevolk and Svartsot too.
p655
aVThere is a spotify list where people add different folk bands. There are tons of different bands on it.  I can't link it atm as i am on mobile but it is called "folk metal"

aVSkálmöld*\u000a\u000aThis is not Mötlëÿ Crüë, the letters are there for a reason. 
p658
aVNot all keyboards have ¨ and ´ keys though.
p659
aVMy English (US) keyboard and keyboard layout do not prevent me from typing Skálmöld (or Sólstafir).  Part of enjoying folk metal for me is respecting other cultures and languages.  Fascinating for me, not as much for others.\u000a\u000aAnyway, search Encyclopaedia Metallum or something and copy/paste from there, probably the easiest.
p660
aVOf course it is great if you get the names right, and it is as you say a way of treating different languages with respect. Still, I often find myself just writing out e.g. Negura Bunget out of laziness, instead of going to some webpage and copy-pasting the correct spelling. It does take a bit more effort.

p745
(lp746
VIf you don't want to mosh, stand towards the back or to the side. If you try to get up near the front of the stage, expect to be run into by moshers several times. Ear plugs are also a good idea if you value your hearing, especially if you will be towards the front. Don't wear open toed shoes.\u000a\u000aI saw them in Oakland, great show! Try to get there on time, because Metsatoll is a really great band that deserves a good audience. Lauri (the one who plays bagpipes/flutes/sings a little) has the best voice ever.
p747
aVYES. Lauri has a fucking awesome voice. Everyone in the band is very friendly. I had the pleasure of speaking with them after the show since they were standing in the venue towards the exit to meet fans as they left. Man, the lead singer has certainly put on a few pounds, that's for sure! But they are all great guys and they put on a fucking AMAZING show. Their music is more "folk" than the other two bands and they have a lot of unique instruments that get used throughout their performance.\u000a\u000aI've seen them twice and both times they made me love their music.
p748
aVDefinitely going to try to hit them at opening, I have been introducing myself to Metsatoll over the past few weeks and I can dig it.\u000a\u000aI'm going to try out some musicians' head phones I've been hearing about. I figure at the very least I can take them out if I don't like it.\u000a\u000aShoes -- I hear about that a lot. I typically wear sturdy running shoes (New Balance), but a lot of people have said go as far as wearing boots. I do have some boots (being Canadian, of course I do) but my feet sweat like a beast when I'm sitting at my desk during the work day in them :P
p749
aVI wouldn't say boots are necessary. I haven't had problems in sneakers.
p750
aVDONE. :P
p751
aVGood boots have saved my toes quite a few times when moshing, but I don't bother with them for shows that I'm not expecting to spend most of the time in the pit.
p752
aVAdding onto the mosh pit, don't fall down. At all. If you do, do everything in your power to get out of the pit, or else you're fucked. Getting trampled in a mosh pit is a really easy way to ruin your week (or more)\u000a\u000aIf you manage to stay standing up, moshing is actually pretty fun! Just be careful about it and remember that if you get hurt, it probably wasn't on purpose. The people are (usually) there to enjoy the music and have fun, not to cause injuries and make enemies.
p753
aV&gt; Getting trampled in a mosh pit\u000a\u000aIs luckily something that is actually pretty rare! At least for all the shows I've been too, whenever someone went down in a pit, there were instantly 5 man helping the guy up. :D
p754
aVYeah, if someone gets trampled and seriously hurt, then the show ends pretty quick and cops show up and there's a lot of very unhappy people
p755
aVI've never had a problem either, I'm usually one of the dudes helping them up to avoid any serious problem.
p756
aVYeah. I'm a tiny girl and tried my hand at moshing, knowing very well that I would end up falling. Got picked right back up no problem and was able to get out of the pit when I wanted to. Won't do it again until I get a bit stronger, but it was still a pretty fun experience.
p757
aVEh, falling down isn't such an issue. Sure, it could turn ugly but usually as an accident rather than a deliberate act. Metalheads generally look out for each other. Most metalhead moshers will likely be falling over each other to help you back up.  I was knocked out cold at a show (my own fault) and woke up to 10 people holding me up. Thanked them and went back to moshing. Thankfully I didn't have a concussion.\u000a\u000aThat said, watch out for the 'Flaily McRagefists' whatever-core types. They're idiots who are more interested in their own personal gratification at limb flailing and taking up the entire pit than moshing as a shared experience. They're easily spotted because they won't actually be moshing to the music playing, but rather to some horrid soundtrack playing in their mind, no doubt accompanied by imagery of themselves masturbating to how cool and edgy they are.
p758
aV&gt; Flaily McRagefists\u000a\u000aI'm stealing that phrase! And yeah, I've seen that kind of dickhead a few times, they always ruin the show whenever they're swinging their arms around and kicking at anyone who comes near them. I missed a boot to my dick by just a few inches at the last show I was at, it was NOT an experience I'd do again...
p759
aVI have to say I'm always amazed to see a pit come to a screeching halt when someone hits the floor. Hell, I saw a pit stop when a guys glass fell and broke.
p760
aVI have also heard like /u/Dread-Ted that it's pretty rare, but I am of course going to be conscious of where I am throwing myself into :P
p761
aVJust watch out for yourself, enjoy the music, and have a good night!
p762
aVI was knocked over while moshing at a small venue in Atlanta once.  The second I hit the floor, some guys grabbed me and picked me up and put me back on my feet before I could even react.
p763
aVI actually went to see the Eluveitie, Tyr, Metsatoll concert as my first concert about a month ago. It was incredible. Absolutely 10/10 amazing. Chrigel was such a nice guy, he thanked the (pretty small) crowd multiple times after each song and seemed like an amazing person. I bought a shirt because of him. My advice if I could do it again: Don't be afraid to go wild. Watch the first few mosh pits to see what other people are doing and then just copy them. Headbang until your neck hurts, and mosh until you have bruises.  \u000a  \u000aFrequent bathroom breaks shouldn't be a problem. The crowd was pretty small and there were breaks between each band. You will have plenty of time to relieve yourself a few times between bands.  \u000aAs for how the concert went, Metsatoll opened and the crowd was nearly stagnant with a few bobbing heads, what can I say, their music just didn't fit the atmosphere. Tyr helped warm up the crowd a little, and there was finally a little bit of hype. By the time Eluveitie got on stage the (600ish) people that were there were going nuts. Mosh pits and headbanging all throughout Eluveitie. It was the most fun I have had all year.
p764
aVThanks for the review! I'm really looking forward to it. My preferences go in that order (probably not surprising), but I've been making a point to listen to some Metsatoll stuff as well and I can dig some of t.
p765
aVI say don't mosh if it's your first show. Unless you don't care about your spot or don't love the bands. Me personally still usually don't mosh unless the bands are on my casual kind of list. I like going early, getting a great spot and keeping it. Moving in a mosh you'll never get your spot back without traversing through people. Don't be that guy 
p766
aVWere you at their Baltimore concert?
p767
aVNope, Charlotte.
p768
aVI saw their debut concert for this tour in Baltimore(and it was also my first concert). All the bands were pretty awesome, and this one guy brought bubbles. It was a fairly good length, about four hours I believe.
p769
aVI was there for my first concert as well! Haha! It really was a fantastic show. Can confirm the bubbles. 
p770
aVI was there! I remember the bubbles. I was in the pit during Eluveitie and ended up in a row of guys, shoulder to shoulder, all of us doing an Irish jig dancing line. Great show.

aVI just saw this line up a few weeks ago! It was soo lovely seeing the ladies from Eluveitie smiling &amp; having fun while playing. &lt;33 \u000a\u000aTyr played Hold The Heathen Hammer high, it was lovey. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe folkmetal show seemed a little tame in comparison to say, a Dying Fetus or Necrophagist show. There were a lot of adorable metal ladies wearing medieval like clothing with long ass hair. It made me super excited to see ladies digging the folk metal arena.
p772
aVI saw them 10/6 in Portland and it was a fucking fantastic show! Hands down the craziest mosh pit incited by a flute solo I've ever been in.\u000a\u000aDon't worry too much about the pit... there are kinda some unspoken rules to them. Try them out if you want but they are avoidable (especially if you like to hang out in the bar). Nearly everyone in or around the pit will immediately stop and and pick you up if you fall (even if you're a super trashed girl who decides the best place to chill is laying on the floor). Our pit actually stopped to help a guy find the pieces to his broken glasses.\u000a\u000aThere was a wall of death... ours ended in a 10 man meat pile, but then rescue crews headed in.\u000a\u000aAll three bands were phenomenal. You're in for a treat.\u000a\u000a
p773
aVAlso: tips for someone who has to piss every hour if he looks at a glass of water (not to mention beer)?
p774
aVdon't get committed to your "spot," and expect to lose it whenever you go piss. or you could be real nasty and just piss in a bottle, and hold a spot up at the barrier (but really, don't actually do that).\u000a\u000aalso, this was a fantastic show, maybe one of the best I've ever seen. you're in for a real treat.
p775
aVIt also seem it's a small venue, so getting out of the crowd and back in somewhere (I'm not picky on my spot) should work for me. Yay old man bladder.
p776
aVHell yeah! I've seen Týr and Eluveitie (and Korpiklaani) every time they've been to Michigan. I'll be there again Oct 16 in Detroit!\u000a\u000aThe mosh pits aren't too crazy. They'll pick you up if you fall, and you can get out when you need. And if there's some douchebag neonazi doing his stomp thing, people stop moshing until he quits (happened at Blondie's once). \u000a\u000aTýr usually doesn't get much of a mosh pit, which i like since i can get to the front row. Of course their new songs are heavier, i think they're trying to get people to mosh. \u000a\u000aAny way, it'll be an awesome show!
p777
aVAwesome, that's the show I'm going to. See you there! How is St Andrews? I've only ever been to Cobo and the Palace.
p778
aVIt's much smaller than those venues. It's long and narrow, so wherever you are, you're in front of the stage. If you get there a bit early, you can get up pretty close. Also, i think St Andrews lists show time, and not doors open time (which is 1 hour prior to the show), so get there on time... I found out the hard way.\u000a\u000aGet there not long after doors open and you can park across the street, super simple and close. They have good security, so the few bums there are shouldn't be a bother.  Overall that place is way better than Harpo's - I'm glad these lesser known metal bands have realized what a shit hole Harpo's is.\u000a\u000aHope that helps. See you there!
p779
aVI also saw the show in Baltimore. Get there early' metsatoll is a treat live. I've been to many shows all over the world, but there are few finer people than folk metal fans. They are friendly to talk to, and comraderie is forgedbin the put. Get in there. Trampleings only happened at the mega shows, and not in many years now. Alternate beers and water because it will be HOT and you should be bouncing around screaming like a viking berserker. How else will the band know you are enjoying what they work so hard to bring?\u000aAlso, dress up or dress down, but none of this middle of the road bullshit. Let that freak flag fly. 
p780
aVThe Folk Metal shows in NYC are always fun, and I haven't seen anyone get seriously injured in the mosh pit.  Occasionally someone loses their glasses and everybody stops moving and helps look.  It seems to be a regional variance.  I went to this past Paganfest in NYC and Massachusetts, and while at Irving Plaza (NYC) everyone was super respectful when things got rowdy, at the Palladium Upstairs (Worcester Mass.) there were a bunch of angsty savages just hurting each-other and even those who weren't trying to participate.\u000a\u000aMaybe that's just Worcester.  Who knows with Detroit?\u000a\u000aAwesome shows, regardless.
p781
aVHey man. I'm 17 and just went to my first metal concert ever. It was the show in Hollywood, CA on October 2nd. Eluveitie is probably my favorite band so that kind of drowned out the slight nervousness I had. Also Nicole was missing due to a family emergency so that was a bummer. I was seriously impressed though, Tyr and Metsatoll are WAY better live than studio in my opinion. Lots of energy and great stage presence. All 3 bands fucking demolished.\u000a\u000aI also met a Danish couple and we spent the whole show together chatting about music and their home country. Very friendly people. \u000a\u000aPoint is, don't worry to much. Everyone is there for the same reason, to enjoy some fucking awesome music. Of all the people I met everyone was super friendly. It turned out to be one of the best experiences ( of the few that I've had) ever. I Hope Eluveitie comes back soon!\u000a
p782
aVNot been too worried, just excited and want to make sure I'm getting the most out of the experience. /nerd\u000a\u000a"Everyone is there for the same reason, to enjoy some fucking awesome music." is generally how I approach most concerts I go to, so makes sense ;)
p783
aVNow that's a good show! Definitely stand in the back if you're not into crowds. \u000a\u000aShooting range earmuffs. They're good too if you're noise sensitive. I also bring something to completely cover my eyes (a hat, sunglasses aren't enough) because flashing lights give me a splitting headache. (Also have other issues but it's not relevant.)\u000a\u000aMake sure you park somewhere where your car isn't going to be stuck in a garage.\u000a\u000a Finally sometimes if you stand by the door you can meet people in the band (if there's only one door to the venue). And you won't be the only fan there.\u000a\u000aHave fun and BE CAREFUL! Just trust me on the be careful in Detroit! I'm not sure where the venue is but always be careful.\u000a\u000aAlso if you have friends online who are going you can possibly meet them there.\u000a\u000aEdit now I'm mad I don't live near Detroit anymore and that I can't drive! 
p784
aVThanks for the tips! I'm going with a buddy, so I'll at least have someone I know.\u000a\u000aAnd yes, always be careful in Detroit. I'm more likely to leave my car in a garage for more security :P
p785
aVYou're welcome. About the garage... first metal show and we parked in a garage... turned out it was some college garage and we got locked out and had trouble getting it out. 
p786
aVI personally went to the show in Sacramento this past Saturday and I can tell you it was phenomenal. Eluveitie is the second best band I have seen live, after Wintersun. It was my girlfriends first time to a metal concert and she doesn't even like metal, and she still enjoyed it. Everyone put on an amazing show. I'd seen Tyr and Metsatoll before but they both **blew me away** by how far they had improved since I saw them last year. Especially Metsatoll.\u000a\u000aDefinitely stand towards the back if you do not want to mosh. I'm a heavy guy so I have no issues with people ramming into me (I don't mosh, but I stand in the front all the time so I am usually the edge of the pit). My girlfriend wasn't so lucky and a huge guy ended up running into her by accident and knocking her into the floor. Luckily nothing happened, she was just a little shaken up!\u000a\u000aFinally, here are some videos I took of the show in Sacramento a few days ago. I hope you enjoy them and that they give you a good idea of what to expect!\u000a\u000aEluveitie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Uh86pVwoGk&amp;list=UUUB4ctWYGdPJ1N0sMvwwB_w\u000a\u000aTyr: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYEoGHbsaQU&amp;list=UUUB4ctWYGdPJ1N0sMvwwB_w
p787
aVOh hey! You're the guy that put the videos up! I've been watching 'em over the past couple of days, so thanks.\u000a\u000aI was the short dude on the rail on the other side (right up against both rails). Definitely an impressive show, that venue may be my new favorite venue in California and would definitely make the 2.5 hour drive to see more shows there.\u000a\u000aLots of young people at the show and this seems to be a lot of people's first metal concert (as evinced by the thread). That was my 7th time seeing Eluveitie, 10th seeing Tyr, and 3rd seeing Metsatöll and I'm glad everyone in this thread seems to be enjoying this tour. I think Tyr's declined quite a bit since 2011ish but Metsatöll crushed it and Eluveitie sounded pretty solid despite Nicole not being there.\u000a\u000aAdvice? Bring earplugs and comfortable shoes. You'll be fine and don't worry about the pits.
p788
aVI'm not young, but just exploring new music these days :) Well... I guess 25 is right in the middle of being young to half the crowd and old to the other :P It is good to hear that younger guys (and girls) are still getting into folk metal. And hopefully we can stop them from become douchebags, too ;)\u000a\u000aAlready bought some musician's earplugs from all the advice I've been hearing. They're something that I can just take out if I don't like 'em so I might as well try it.\u000a\u000aShoes -- trying to figure out if I'm going to go with my normal sturdy running shoes. A lot of people say wear boots but damn... my boots make my feet sweat on normal days where I'm just sitting at my desk.
p789
aVLooking forward to it even more after all the good reviews I've seen. What song is that first one? I can't make it out from the setlists I've looked up.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Oh, I see in the title it's Sucellos. I better go back and review some of the other setlists now that they've played more shows to add songs to my playlist :P
p790
aVUpdate after the show! Thanks all you guys here for the discussion. I've been pumped or the show for several weeks and I am geeking out since the moment it ended.\u000a\u000aMy buddy couldn't come with me (his passport wasn't in yet), so I ended up taking my friends 17yo song who is into a lot of metalcore and stuff.\u000a\u000aRicky and I arrived about an hour early. After narrowly escaping a hobo and being trapped in a tiny bathroom stall, we waited outside Saint Andrews for a bit before we realized the line was on the other side of the stair way. Oops. So we got in line and talked this cool bro named Eric who seemed to be there by himself. Ricky and he had way more to talk about in there metal band ways, of course.\u000a\u000aThe juicy parts... Eventually we got in and grabbed some t-shirts and waited for the first act. The venue was a lot smaller than pretty much anything I've ever been to -- which I think was a plus (more on that later).\u000a\u000aMetsatoll came out on stage with no preamble or introduction and started playing. The crowd was a bit weak at first but started jamming along. Honestly I don't know what songs they played except for Kivine Maa which is the only song of theirs I know well enough (and I was pumped when the weird boingy sound started the song). They didn't play too long but it was a good set for not knowing any of the other songs and not understanding Estonian . The band members were really into it. The lead singer and guitarist (Lauri is his name I think) was so full of energy and really added to the stage presence. The bagpipe player went pretty hardcore and played his pipes behind his head like a mother fucking viking Jimi Hendrix. And the drummer looked vaguely like Slash, at least with the hair.\u000a\u000aTyr was up next and I learned something. One, it's not pronounced "tear". "Tee-air" or even "tay-are" perhaps, I don't remember . Second, the difference between the lead vocalist/guitarist and bass players like facial expression and attitude. The lead was all stony faced and "I am a fucking viking God of metal" and the bassist was like a fat, jolly, guitar licking energetic guy that kind of reminded me of Sebastian Bach.\u000a\u000aTyr's setlist was great and their performance was awesome. They're not as folk as the other two (no folk instruments), but still really enjoyable and enough up my alley for me to enjoy them. Highlights of the set list were Blood of Heroes, Hold the Heathen Hammer High, By the Sword in My Hand, and finishing with Shadow of the Swastika. Actually there were several more worth naming, too...\u000a\u000aAnd this is where I begin to get into the show a lot more. I've always heard about how metalheads are the best kind of people, and I was explaining to Ricky on the way to the show the difference between the perception of metal core and true heavy metal. One is typically a younger, teenage crowd of guys trying to prove something and generally people being dicks and trying to hurt other people. The other is a bunch of guys who all enjoy the same thing (metal) and want to dance around and have a good time (and whose idea of dancing is slamming into each other). Or so I had heard.\u000a\u000aUnsurprisingly and to my amusement, this turned out to be true. Metalheads are pretty fucking rad people as a whole. Where a half-drunk, wild mob might turn into a violent mess in other groups instead becomes a moshing mass of camaraderie. The first exhibit was a mosh pit during Tyr. It was fairly mellow to begin with the same 5-6 guys smashing around -- including a very large and tall dude who weighed probably upwards of 350 lbs. Who at one point happened to get knocked down. Immediately, the rest of the pit stopped and helped him up, to be met by a chorus of cheers (including the guy himself). Following that, some guy grabbed one of the moshers by the arm -- and handed him his phone which he had dropped. This was met by much hurrah and many hugs.\u000a\u000aI proceeded to headbang and sing through the rest of Tyr's set, including belting out By The Sword In My Hand with another large Viking looking dude (hint, there are a lot of large viking looking dudes at these things). Then there was a line of arm-in-arm headbanging as well.\u000a\u000aTyr finished off with Shadow of the Swastika which I didn't expect to be one of their biggest hits but makes sense now especially for a set ender (high energy, and the line "and you can kiss my Scandinavian ass" was great to scream out with the crowd).\u000a\u000aSome down time for stretching my old bones and hydrating before Eluveitie. They were why I came to this show. A band who isn't all that mainstream, especially in NA, and who I had never really expected to get the chance to see. Tyr I have listened to a bit recently and Metsatoll I only just discovered when I bought tickets for this tour and started doing my setlist prep. But Eluveitie I've been listening to for probably 3 years, perhaps more. I've even begun to appreciate some -- *some* -- death metal vocals because of their music.\u000a\u000aTo summarize their performance, it was fucking amazing. They managed to fit all 8 band members on that tiny stage and put a ton of energy into the show. Lead vocalist Chrigel was incredibly intense throughout the entire setlist and the whole band put on an amazing show, even though the crowd and venue was relatively small. When a musician really enjoys performing (and you can tell) it adds so much to the experience.\u000a\u000aThe setlist was pretty sweet. They played a lot from their newest album, of course, and at least one song from the others (several from Helvetios). It was changed up a bit from what I had looked up previously, like starting with King (which was an Encore or main setlist ender) instead of The Nameless. There were a few songs I was disappointed not to hear. Alesia they haven't been playing at their recent shows even though I think it's one of the best songs on Helvetios, but Celtos was on most of their previous stops and I had really warmed up to it. (Disclaimer -- so much metal has been running through my mind lately that they may have played it and I'm mistaken but I'm leaning towards no because I think I would've remember it more explicitly).\u000a\u000aNonetheless, the setlist still rocked. Too many to name all the awesome songs, but highlights/my favourites were King, From Darkness, A Rose For Epona (where Anna threw out plastic roses to the crowd), Thousandfold... And the two encore songs were awesome show enders. Helvetios is so powerful with its chorus ("cause we're born free / cause we're born wild / cause we are indominantable and bold") and of course the "crowd's turn to sing" favourite, Inis Mona.\u000a\u000aI had taken in most of the first two sets from mid-hall, just on the edge of the mosh pits. As Eluveitie's set got into it I decided to throw myself into the pit for some metal dancing. Pushing each other around and then headbanging and singing as the songs went on was thrilling. Its been almost 10 years since I've been to a concert where I wasn't sitting and I've forgotten how much fun it was.\u000a\u000aI made my way up to the front, center stage (it wasn't that difficult I'm the small hall). I rocked out there with some rad dudes and chicks (including a guy named Zak but who preferred to be called "cupcake" or so he told me, and who swung me back in after I ran for a piss break). I wasn't right against the bar but it was the best thing. Being in the press of jumping, fist pumping, singing, sweaty bodies was a part of concerts that I miss, and I don't think it gets more intense and energetic than it is at a metal show.\u000a\u000aAnd then... And then Chrigel says to the crowd something like "you guys are already moshing that is fucking awesome. But you know there is a tradition in metal..." And I look at this total stranger beside me and he looks and ms and we both say "Wall. Of. Death." And I know I am in. I didn't expect to, but at that point, there was no way I could not. I was completely in the zone. And then I tell him... I'm a virgin. Let's fucking do this. We split, and I am at the front of a wall of people, staring across the empty floor at another wall. And the drums smash and we smash into each other, happy as fuck and I'm giddy inside because when has running around wild ever not been fun. I fall to the floor with another guy but I'm not worried, and within seconds we're picked up and moshing again and I press back to the front to headbang and sing once more.\u000a\u000aAnd I really enjoyed the venue. It was a small hall -- stage took up one entire (short) end, merch booth down one side and bar down the other. I loved that I was only 10 feet from the band. I didn't have to squeeze by a bunch of seats to get a drink or use the pisser (which as an old man I do frequently), and I could easily make my way back to my spot in the crowd when I got back.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an absolutely amazing experience. I left wanting so much more. If I could get to Montreal and back instantaneously, I'd go see them again tomorrow. I want to throw on more metal (and I picked up some recommendations) and jam out all day. My neck is sore and my throat is raw but I'm headbanging in the car and still singing.\u000a\u000aI'd totally see them again if I had the chance. Eluveitie especially, but Tyr was amazing as well and Metsatoll was an awesome opening act (which should not be skipped).\u000a
p791
aVAwesome review! I totally agree with everything you said. I'm glad you liked it, and I'm sure I saw you in the mosh or wall of death, I was at the back left of the mosh pit standing next to a few guys taller than me (I'm 6'2"). Anyway, it was probably one of the best concerts I've ever been to! Everything was perfect.\u000a\u000aOh, and I believe Týr is pronounced "Toy-er", the ý is an "oy" sound in Faroese.
p792
aVToy-er sounds about right. I forget it about 5 seconds after I hear it :p\u000a\u000aI was the guy with the batman shirt on :D
p793
aVMy first concert was seeing Eluveitie live at the Masquerade in Atlanta.  I may be a it biased because Eluveitie is my favorite band, but it was unbelievable.  Stay away from the front if you don't want to mosh.
p794
aVYay! I saw them last week, it was great. I will warn you that Eluveitie instigated a wall of death that looked kind of harsh, but it looked like people who needed to get out of the way had enough time to do so. I stayed in the back with all the other people whose idea of dancing is bobbing their head along to the song, it was pretty mellow outside of the mosh pit area.
p795
aVI wish I had a picture of the look on the faces of the two bouncers up at the barriers when Chrigel yelled WALL OF DEATH.
p796
aVI was at what I assume was a classier joint in Louisville for blackguard, metsatoll and tyr and I don't think they ever had a metal show before. We went in and scattered on the floor were tables with candles (yes glass and lit) we were like oh shit. Staff saw the crowd coming and probably thought the same thing. Those were picked up quickly. \u000a\u000aAlso same with their faces for wall of death lol
p797
aVI'm actually going to go see them tomorrow, I'll tell you what it was like, I really enjoy Tyr and Metsatoll too.
p798
aVEluveitie come to Canada too, i don't know where you are located but look it up, it might be closer to you. 
p799
aVThey're playing in Toronto the day after, but Toronto is a 4 hour drive and Detroit is a 30 minute drive :P Plus, oddly enough, Thursday night concerts are easier for my schedule than Friday night ones.
p800
aVSounds like you're in the Windsor area. I want to see this tour when it hits Montreal, but work might be making it impossible for me to go. 
p801
aVYup, Windsor. I hope you get to go man!
p802
aVI have to wonder if I made the right choice. I could have either seen this in two weeks, or seen Skeletonwitch, Sabaton, and Amon Amarth friday. I latched onto the latter, partly because Sabaton has an incredible stage presence, partly because a friend of mine is going, but I've always wanted to see Tyr live.
p803
aVHope you have fun at that show regardless :D Maybe try to do both, hehe, ;)
p804
aVI would have loved to, but I'm a poor university student :P
p805
aVIf you got age. Its good to just watch and listen the band with beer/coke from the back also. Have fun!
p806
asVI made a bagpipe metal playlist on Spotify.. Help me make it better?
p807
(lp808
VWaylander is first to come to mind.
p809
aVI'm hearing mostly tin whistle from them. Any specific songs?
p810
aVScáthach from the suidakra album crógacht
p811
aVTriddana
p812
aVI have their album in there.. or is there a specific song you had in mind? Thanks though!
p813
aVSorry! The playlist wasn't showing very well on mobile so it was difficult to tell what was on there. The whole ripe for rebellion album is gold though
p814
aVIt's definitely one of my all time favorite albums
p815
aVGravedigger.
p816
aVElvenking - The Loser\u000a\u000aAlso "Through Wolf's Eyes" by the same band.
p817
aVThose are both good songs but neither has bagpipes. They use the violin. Thanks for the suggestion though!
p818
aVThere's got to be more Dropkick Murphys to add.  "Going Out In Style" comes to mind.  I'm sure there's more.\u000a\u000aI am enjoying the list.
p819
aVYeah somehow the lack of dropkick never occurred to me, but that has been rectified
p820
aVYou might find some more ideas here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nontraditional_bagpipe_usage\u000a\u000aScroll down to the section titled "Bagpipes in rock (common usage)".  I don't know hardly any of these groups, but you may find some good stuff in there.
p821
aVAwesome! Thanks
p822
asVIs there Confederate folk metal?
p823
(lp824
VIced Earth's Glorious Burden portrayed both sides fairly sympathetically, without veering off into "The South Will Rise Again!" territory or racism. The Gettysburg trilogy showed the tragedy of the whole affair decently. That's about as close as I can get, but if anyone else knows of similar albums or bands (especially those that use instruments like banjos, mandolins, etc.) I'd like to know!
p825
aVWhy is "The South will rise again!" a bad thing, though? Shouldn't everyone have the right to autonomy/sovereignty? I'm not trying to make this political, but come on, man.\u000a\u000aThanks for the band suggestions, though. 
p826
aVIn and of itself, it isn't a bad thing. Independence is always something that people of a certain region will feel sympathetic towards. North America has lots of examples - Cascadia, Quebec, the South, the (Canadian) West, etc., but for the South in particular, there's a correlation between people who truly believe it and people who believe in racial purity. Quebecois independence has its own issues with cultural purity, and people who want the Canadian West to be independent are generally libertarians of the worst sort (not all, though!). 
p827
aVWell, I'll tell you this much. If we were to ever have to fight, and I pray it don't come to war, for our sovereignty, then I'd hope and wish for every race, religion and creed to fight along side me. 
p828
aVIts unfortunate that you're ignorant of the very history you're wanting to honor. The Confederacy was about State's Rights.  To own slaves.  \u000a\u000aCornerstone Address 1861, Confederate V. President Stephens:\u000a\u000a**Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition.**\u000a\u000aThis, our new Government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. This truth has been slow in the process of its development, like all other truths in the various departments of science. It is so even amongst us. Many who hear me, perhaps, can recollect well that this truth was not generally admitted, even within their day. The errors of the past generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago. Those at the North who still cling to these errors with a zeal above knowledge, we justly denominate fanatics. All fanaticism springs from an aberration of the mind; from a defect in reasoning. It is a species of insanity. One of the most striking characteristics of insanity, in many instances, is, forming correct conclusions from fancied or erroneous premises; so with the anti-slavery fanatics: their conclusions are right if their premises are. **They assume that the negro is equal, and hence conclude that he is entitled to equal privileges and rights, with the white man...** I recollect once of having heard a gentleman from one of the Northern States, of great power and ability, announce in the House of Representatives, with imposing effect, that we of the South would be compelled, ultimately, to yield upon this subject of slavery; that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics, as it was in physics or mechanics. That the principle would ultimately prevail. That we, in maintaining slavery as it exists with us, were warring against a principle-a principle founded in nature, the principle of the equality of man. \u000a\u000aThe reply I made to him was, that upon his own grounds we should succeed, and that he and his associates in their crusade against our institutions would ultimately fail. The truth announced, that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics as well as in physics and mechanics, I admitted, but told him it was he and those acting with him who were warring against a principle. They were attempting to make things equal which the Creator had made unequal.\u000a\u000aIn the conflict thus far, success has been on our side, complete throughout the length and breadth of the Confederate States. It is upon this, as I have stated, our social fabric is firmly planted; and I cannot permit myself to doubt the ultimate success of a full recognition of this principle throughout the civilized and enlightened world.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you're not clear on what the principle he talks about yet, its that Blacks are chattel and undeserving of equal status to Whites. \u000a\u000aI'm tired of pretending the Confederate flag isn't the hillbilly swastika it obviously is. \u000a\u000a\u000a

aVI was talking about today, but whatever man. You believe all that brainwashing you were indoctrinated with. 
p830
aVThose are the words, right from the mouth of the Confederate Vice President, spelling out the **cornerstone** of what the South stands for.  \u000a\u000aIts like arguing against gravity because its *just a theory.*  \u000a
p831
aVYou, sir, know not what you speak of. \u000a\u000aI'm sure Biden represents everything the Democrats stand for, right? I mean, he's their spokesperson, and everything he says should be stated as the beliefs of the entire left, am I right?
p832
aVWhy not just check the states' declarations of secession. Slavery was the first and foremost reason stated in at least a few states' declarations, and I believe it was a major topic in all of them. And really, that's what it was all about.\u000a\u000aSouthern pride, etc.? Go for it. But the Confederacy isn't really something to be glorified like it so often is. I get that it represents a lot of ideals that are close to you, but when it comes down to it, its foundation was an attempt to continue to be able to own other people.
p833
aVMany people honor heritages that have made mistakes.  Nearly every culture can atone to that.  Just because you have "southern pride" does not mean that you are racist or want to return to slavery times.  And just because your history book tells you so doesn't mean its true.  The world is not black or white.  One mans statements do not reflect the entirety of the peoples thoughts or opinions.
p834
aVWell said.
p835
aVBravo!
p836
aVHrmmm...that would be an interesting genre. The closest thing I can think of is Southern Rock (lynyrd skynyrd obviously).
p837
aVEh, I don't like Lynyrd Skynyrd. I use to, until they became openly anti-Southern. Also, they're not metal, they're classic rock. 
p838
aVI know, it's just the only confederate themed music I could think of. 
p839
aVI hear you. \u000a\u000aDrive By Truckers is a good band, if you're into Skynyrd btw. 
p840
aVWell since America is very limited when it comes to Folk Metal I don't think you'll find what you're looking for.  The closest thing to Southern Pride Metal would be Rebel Meets Rebel.  Basically Pantera with David Allen Coe singing.  Funny how even a suggestion of Southern pride turns into an argument about racism, etc.
p841
aVI know right? That's that Yankee indoctrination for you.\u000a\u000aYeah, I really like David Allen Coe, although I wouldn't have considered him metal. I'll look the band up, though. Thanks, man.
p842
aV[deleted]
p843
aVThat's interesting. \u000a\u000a  You should start that band.\u000a\u000a If there is music that exists in your mind and nowhere else, why not materialize it? You don't have to get rich and famous but creation is it's own reward.
p844
aV[deleted]
p845
aVI do not. I don't really have that musical talent, as I've tried to learn, but have failed each time. \u000a\u000aI think if you want to have that heart in your folk music, you got to listen to Appalachian songs. That's true American folk music, right there. 
p846
aVI had an idea to do metal themed on Texas cowboys and Indians type culture, since I live in Texas.  Truth be told, I actually despise Texan everything is bigger attitude, but it would be fun to sing a song about gunslingers and bounty hunters.  The idea fell through and now we're just a normal metal band singing about various other things.\u000a\u000aI would like to here some good historical Sabaton-style civil war metal, but told from the Union side.  Because fuck slavery.  In fact, the closest I can think to your question is Grinded Nig, a horrible Texan band that consisted of neo-Nazis and KKK thugs.  I only found them on Metal Archives and was disgusted and amused.
p847
aVPlease do not relate Fascists and racist idiots with the Confederacy. \u000a\u000aMexicans, Indians, and yes even blacks fought for the Confederacy. I believe one of our Secretary of State was even Jewish. We had Irish fight in our ranks with Kelly's Irish brigade as well. 
p848
aVThe CSA was kind of founded on Biblically/pseudoscientifically-justified theories of white racial supremacy. I don't really see the point you're making. There were plenty of Africans who fought for Rommel, doesn't mean anything. I don't think that everyone who fought for the CSA was a horrible bigot or whatever, plenty honorable and brave men as well as  irredeemable scum on both sides of that lil skirmish. Anyway, have you checked out Hank III? Maybe you hate country, but it scratches the same itch for me as folk metal. He also does metal but it doesn't quite do it for me besides his cattle-call grindcore.
p849
aVI've listened to Hank III, and I think he's better when he sings the older stuff. I'm not really interested in that cursing white trash stuff. He's more Rock a Billy, then metal. 
p850
aVFair enough. What would you want to see out of a Confederate folk metal band? I feel like it'd be really hard to pull off without discussing race.
p851
aVWhen I think of Confederate folk metal, I think of Viking metal. However, instead of songs about waring Vikings, we listen to songs about waring Confederates. \u000a\u000aRace would have nothing to do with it, because it'd be about the Confederate "warrior" defending his homeland from the Yankee horde, and not about the politicians and plantation owners. Does Viking metal ever bring up how the Vikings would slaughter defenseless monks or enslave people (well, I'm sure some does, but you get my point)?\u000a\u000a
p852
aVThe majority of 'Viking metal' is oriented around violence, booze and mythology, often talking about putting monks to the sword, yes. Why is the Confederate warrior defending his homeland? Why does the Confederate insist upon independence? What is truly at stake for him and his that is not at stake for the Union besides the loss of human chattel? I can see there being a Sabaton-type band oriented around the Civil War, but I can't see a purely Confederate folk metal group that wouldn't be basically all about white power tunes.
p853
aVThere were Indians, and Mexicans who fought for the Confederacy too. Irish, Catholics, and even one of the Secretary of States was Jewish. \u000a\u000aI mean, Sabaton would be a perfect example or Amon Amarth. Just replace Odin with God, Vikings with Confederates, Swords and axes with Bayonets and Cannons. There you go, you got a great Confederate metal song.\u000a\u000aHere, this is what I'm looking for but in metal form \u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kWADI4umuM\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLMU90Aa2Oo\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdIGFOGzjJ8\u000a\u000aThese songs might sound bad to metalheads, but just imagine Amon Amarth singing these. 
p854
aVI know that the CSA armed forces were not racially homogenous. I also don't find that information particularly meaningful. Neither was the Wehrmacht, but Nazi folk metal is, well, Nazi folk metal - but hey, I listen to a lot of fascist music, a lot of neofolk and neoclassical. I just don't like WNs and don't like getting certain songs stuck in my head. If there was a folk metal band that incorporated hillbilly shit, rebel yells, etc., - even if it talked about slavery in an interesting way - I'd probably fuck with it. One of my favorite bands at the moment, Death in June, has a really interesting way of being almost nostalgic while also being cynical about its object of nostalgia (mid-1930s German political climate).\u000a\u000aThe reason why I reference Sabaton is because they write their songs from multiple perspectives and in an overtly theatrical, unserious manner. If there were songs that were sympathetic to both sides - which is something you kind of see in Amon Amarth, too - that'd be cooler. If there was stuff that openly acknowledged the menace of both sides in a Cormac McCarthyish way that'd be cool too. No heroes, just honorable death.
p855
aVI guess I'm just not getting your animosity toward Confederate centred music. I mean, you say you listen to Nazi metal, but you don't like WNs? Well, I'm not a white nationalist, and I just told you about other races and groups who fought for the Confederacy, and the Indians and Mexicans fought alongside Texans and Tennesseeians. They weren't seperated at all, like in the North, but I really don't want to get into politics.\u000a\u000aI just want to listen to Viking/folk metal-esque music about Confederate soldiers. I don't have to support the politics of the time to respect my ancestors who fought for my State, do I? As far as I know, my family never owned slaves, but again I'm getting off topic. It just frustrates me how I just want to honour my ancestors or feel proud of them, while others just want to bring up slavery. Well, Vikings had slaves too, but no one cares about that. What's the difference? \u000a\u000aMy point is, we don't have to bring up slavery at all. Just talk about the war, not the politics. 
p856
aVWhite Americans definitely didn't invent black slavery and your ancestors don't have a damn thing to be ashamed of for laying down  their lives for what they thought was right. Honor them as it makes sense to you. Owning slaves was, however, a shameful and evil thing that lay right at the heart of the Confederacy. I know my ancestors owned slaves in the Caribbean. One of them was a [London merc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_St._Leger_Grenfell) who fought under Braxton Bragg, but I dunno if he owned slaves. He fought for money and tried to take Chicago. Sure was a character. I will say for the last time that I consider it completely irrelevant that the CSA was not ethnically homogenous. Had the CSA succeeded, the institution of slavery would have continued for some time longer, period, and I think it's a good thing that the Union won. I am also not denying that Yankees were and are bigoted, often in a more insidious manner than any southerner. \u000a\u000aI have no problem with Confederate-centered music, I just don't think it could be done *chauvinistically*, a la most folk metal, in a manner I would find very interesting or listenable. Simplifying the struggle that people on both sides of the war had to some Manichaean shit just sounds boring to me. I don't listen to Nazi metal because it's mostly boring, nor do I listen to antifa shit besides like Billy Bragg and some leftist country. I do listen to stuff that uses fascist symbology in interesting ways. \u000a\u000aThe difference between Scandinavian thralldom and Black slavery in the Americas should be easily discoverable with a few minutes spent on Wikipedia.\u000a\u000aIf you make or listen to Confederate music, people are gonna talk politics no matter what. \u000a\u000aTLDR On the whole, I think Confederate folk metal is a potentially interesting idea that would predictably rustle many jimmies. The only people in metal singing Dixie's praises at the moment that I know of are making white power crap, which is lame.
p857
aVI guess I agree with most of what you're saying, and I definitely know where you're coming from. You're right on that last comment, "white power" bull has really put a damper on us Southrons. People associate symbols and people with things that ought not be associated. It's sad, and hopefully these ignorant perceived correlations will fade with time, and people of all colour will be able to honour our symbols without thinking of "racism". \u000a\u000aHopefully someone will sing a melodic folk metal song about Confederates charging a cannon battery for glory and freedom, without caring if he's called "racist" for it.\u000a\u000aAgain, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but Thralls sound a lot like Southern slaves. http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/thralls.shtml
p858
aVI read the same page and reached an exactly opposite conclusion to yours from it, but I won't let that spoil our resolution.
p859
aVI don't know, I've read a lot about slavery since I'm interested in that time period and history, so that might be why it reminded me so much of it. I mean, to me, it sounded nearly the same except Thralls couldn't get married, and Southern slaves could. \u000a\u000aI'm glad we've found a resolution. 
p860
aVThe confederacy wasn't all about slavery, but the cultural idealism here in the south, at least where I am, can be split into two factions.  Those who know nothing of history and just stick a confederate flag on their truck to look badass, and those who secretly hate minorities.  It's unfortunate that there isn't much middle ground. 
p861
aVWell, I'm that middle ground. What you have to do, is educate those who are ignorant of their actual history, and ignore the racists. \u000a\u000aYou're right, though, it's very sad people don't know more about history.

aVI listened to them, not bad, but not exactly what I'm looking for. I had previously listened to Tyr, wasn't getting into it, and I just recently started liking them a lot. I guess I could've phrased it better, what I was looking for was progressive folk/viking metal, but thank you for the suggestion, I appreciate it! 
p876
aVYou might enjoy some Suidakra. I'm using a POS computer so I can't go find any links right now, but look into some of their newer stuff. The songs Defiant Dreams and Pair Daedeni are pretty technical but they aren't exactly viking metal. They're a German pagan band and the album those two songs are on is written about Roman history.\u000a\u000aAlso, Folkstone, Enslaved and Borknagar might come pretty close to what you're looking for.
p877
aVWill check them out, thanks!

asVWhat do you think of Arkona's new album Yav?
p883
(lp884
VI absolutely love Yav. It's one of the few cases where the band calling an album "serious" isn't a nail in its coffin. If there was any change from Slovo to Yav then I think it was merely the band reaching the endpoint of a very long journey. With every single album they released, Arkona was becoming more and more progressive. Yav is just them committing to that for an entire album, and they released an amazing piece.
p885
aVI agree - the way Masha's songwriting developed over the years is amazing and reached it's peak in complexity with Yav (so far). I heard she's already writing new songs, really curious about what's coming next - even if it'll take a while of course.
p886
aVMasha is really on another level with her talent in singing, writing &amp; arranging. I do wish they brought Vedan Kolod into this album just because their voices together is really beautiful. Slovo is my favorite I think but I'm so happy Yav happened. I can't get enough.

p955
aVI suspect they wouldn't even be considered a novelty if there were more pirate bands.  Viking metal would be a novelty if Amon Amarth was the only band that did it.\u000a\u000aAlestorm is still reeeaaally gimmicky though, and that's ok.
p956
aVThanks for showing me amon amarth. Got anymore like this? I fucking love songs that tell stories (ballads). 
p957
aVIf you want similar to Amon Amarth check out King of Asgard.  Ensiferum has some similarities, but they're most folky.  Most Viking metal bands tell stories, although not all of them are ballads.  Amon Amarth has some great ballad/stories, namely Last With Pagan Blood, Where Silent Gods Stand Guard, Warriors of the North, Embrace of the Endless Ociean, Prediction of Warfare, and my favorite, Thousand Years of Oppression.
p958
aVIt's kind of made OK by the fact that they know their entire act and music is gimmicky.  \u000a\u000aThe melodies in this song could easily transition into anyone of their drinking songs and the lyrics are unoriginal by the bands own admission, but they know this.  It's just so damn fun and you know it's going to be cheesy and stupid-in-a-fun-way.  \u000a\u000aJust look at Chris Bowe's side project, Gloryhammer.  He is spreading the cheese from pirates to medieval battles.  \u000aI think this verse from "Scraping the Barrel" sums it all up:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMany have told us that we can't go on\u000a\u000aThat one day we'll run out of lyrics for songs\u000a\u000aBut when the time comes to write album four\u000a\u000aWe'll scrape out the barrel once more

Are they referring to a specific sub - genre of folk metal consisting of bands which are from geographical locations which historical spoke Celtic dialects or is it just an umbrella term for pagan metal/folk metal with western European sounding melodies?

aVTo me celtic metal would mean folk metal that sounds [similar to this compilation, i guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwuQ6UHMQg)

asVEnsiferum - Cry for the Earth Bounds
p975
(lp976
VEvery song on this new album has been amazing. Many tracks harder than usual which has been awesome. This is the most unique of the songs so far and this is EXACTLY the reason I love this band so much. Such a unique sound and mix of different elements. Amazing song. Love the different paces and vocals. Epic. 
p977
aVI've decided that since I pre-ordered the album, I'm not gonna listen to these Spotify releases (okay, so maybe I've listened to Axe of Judgement). but man, oh man, comments like these are really getting me pumped. because honestly, I was kinda disappointed with One Man Army and Heathen Horde. but it seems like the songs released as promos or singles or whatever are always really lame anyway. 
p978
aVHeathen Horde took a few listens to grow on me and I'm rather fond of it now.  One Man Army is still by far the weakest track released so far -- everything else has been excellent.
p979
aVThat's awesome. And axe of judgment is fucking great. STRIKE!\u000aI really like One Man Army, they go hard. \u000aCry fo the Earth bound ... most unique Ensiferum song. So many different elements. Almost brings tears. I've loved almost every song by this band. I take it for what it is too. A lot of people complained about Unsung Heroes and I fucking loved it. No other band makes music like they do. Super unique sound and so god damn epic.

aVI guess their electric instruments are powered by the spirits of the forest
p996
aVTo be fair, the song is called "The Call of the Mountains"- where else would you do a music video?
p997
aVThat's not the problem, it's the part where there is literally nothing in this video that separates it visually from any other Eluveitie vid. I get wanting to showcase the scenery and nature, but if that's your goal then make those sweeping landscape shots last longer and have more impact. Let us fly over the mountaintops and climb through the forests, don't just show us footage of the band pretending to play a song for the millionth time.

aVI wish they would find someone who can actually mix and master. It would improve their sound so fucking much.\u000a\u000aBut that's my gripe with all metal.

p1095
aVElvenking is a pretty good metal band, and very fantasy-based. Somewhat light on the folk though - just a violin and some acoustic guitars for parts of songs. I'd recommend anything off "The Pagan Manifesto", especially Witches Gather. 
p1096
aVIn Extremo is an acquired taste, I like one or two of their songs (Vollmund, Vanera vrende I can't spell...) but it's sad to say that their lead singer sounds better as a guest vocalist on other band's songs. (He gets like, one tiny verse in Faun's "Bundes Volk" and totally wins... at that verse. He also wins on his cameo on a live clip of Schandmaul's "Willst Du".) \u000a\u000aSpeaking of, they are very much not metal, but Faun. I'm not sure how he'll like it but they make good music. "Blaue Stunde" has a guest male singer who's name I can't remember. Faun is wonderful, but not metal. (I'm not sure exactly if Fiona plays bagpipes, it kind of blurs together with the hurdy gurdy sometimes.)\u000a\u000aI don't think Subway To Sally have bagpipes in their music.Crunchy is how I describe them.They are part of an offshoot of folk metal called mitteralter/medieval metal/rock (Faun is a non-metal part of this genre).I'm not sure how well the lead singer's voice will go over if he didn't like In Extremo.\u000a\u000aI'm really out of the loop with folk metal, didn't listen to it for well over a year (not my choice). So what little serious folk metal I remember is stuck in summer 2010, even that's a little blurry. (Oddly enough I got into all the medieval stuff via Eluveitie.)\u000a\u000aOne last thing: I have found quite a few new bands to listen to via streaming radio. Base a station on a band he likes and see if he finds anything else he likes from that.

aVGood suggestions all around, thanks!

aV&gt; Subway To Sally have bagpipes\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRwvj0H5ia8\u000a\u000aThey have it pretty rarely because if they use it their lead singer plays it. \u000a\u000aand it is mittelalter ;)\u000a\u000aThe songnames are: Vänner och frände and Vollmond\u000a\u000aAnd because you like Micha as a guestsinger if got another appearance from him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msz97HQo2-E (with the singer of subway https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sifM_9DIVbI)

aVFaun went over beautifully - the best of the recommendations to date. Not really metal (okay, not at all metal, heh) but he fell in love with it. It almost has a Blackmore's Night feel, but richer... good stuff.\u000a\u000aIn Extremo is still a no-go, which makes me sad.
p1101
aVI'm glad he liked Faun. What did he think of Subway To Sally?
p1102
aVHaven't tried that one yet - or if he did, it didn't make enough of an impression to tell me about it.
p1103
aVTry Nine Treasures, they have a very oriental feel but it might be interesting enough to hook you and him up :)\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e1JyWgVfnI\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the same style there's also Tengger Cavalry who make great stuff, mixing mongolian throat chants with pagan/folk metal.\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUja-wrQVgs\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso you might try more acoustic pagan bands like Krauka(Norse Traditional Music), Stille Volk(French Medieval Folk), Corvus Corax(Very popular Acoustic Metalish Folk band from Germany), Batards du Nord(Quebecois Traditional Norse Music), Tribu Kornu(Same as Batards but Irish trad). Imo, they all fit very well in a metal playlist as their sound and themes fit very well with Folk Metal and they provide an interlude between face melting songs.

p1106
aVHe's pretty eclectic - which is to say that he goes through phases where he listens to a genre vastly different from the previous one, and then gets bored with it and starts looking for new things. We've been through a Disturbed/Godsmack phase, a pop phase, a broody goth phase, a country-and-western phase (that one was *particularly* trying for yours truly), a Celtic/New Age phase which casually blended into a neopagan phase (which - some of those guys are amazing artists, but then you have stuff like Moonstruck, which he inexplicably couldn't get enough of but which, to me, sounded like cats having their paws stepped on, repeatedly....) There was an 80s phase (actually that one comes and goes quite a big, because nostalgia) and even a very brief rap phase. And so on.
p1107
aVI'm a bit stunned two bands haven't been suggested yet.  The first is Wintersun.  They've many great songs but my favorite is this one.

aVThank you!
p1109
aVGlittertind,  turisas, korpiklaani, orphaned land, sabaton (somewhat folk metalish), alestorm (pirate metal is a sort of folk metal).\u000a\u000aNow I also recommend Triddana, which does have bagpipes *but* they are really well put into the song and melody, and I do say the band has the best lead singer of any folk metal band - like Dio with more power.
p1110
aVTriddana was a total success (you weren't kidding about Dio, were you?) - I believe his exact words were "fuck yeah!"
p1111
aVTriddana is always a lot of power and a storm of great rocking metal! They will release a new album this year. Also, of you cant wait, Skiltron is basically the same band before they had a split. Same vocallist and such
p1112
aVExcellent, thank you!!
p1113
aVWe tried Turisas already (no go); Korpikllani *definitely* has the high-pitched stuff (I like them but didn't even try them on my husband); Alestorn is hit-or-miss but he liked some of their stuff. \u000a\u000aWill try the others, thanks!
p1114
aV&gt; I do say the band has the best lead singer of any folk metal band - like Dio with more power.\u000a\u000aThat's only if you like that kind of "heavy metal" voice. One of the reasons I like folk / power metal is that they don't have enough heavy metal similarities. Thanks anyway for your suggestions.

p1150
aVJust on the chance that you haven't heard them, you should check out Korpiklaani and Alestorm. I'd say several of their songs fit "bawdy drinking songs."\u000a\u000aParticularly [Rum by Alestorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACNKKPw_iXM)\u000a\u000aand [Vodka by Korpiklaani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7kJRGPgvRQ)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

p1152
aVAt some point, you start beating a dead horse. They've done beer, vodka, and tequila. They're Finnish, beer and vodka is a given. Tequila was from how much they enjoyed their first South American tour. They don't have to go on singing about rum, or gin, or anything else alcohol.\u000a\u000aI love those songs just as much as I love the others that are more of nature and Finnish lore and history. I'll gladly listen to Suden Joiku and With Trees, but there's many a day where you get home from work, or off the phone after a bad conversation, anything annoying or something like that, and you just want to sit down, or jump all over the place, and blast Vodka, Bring Us Pints of Beer, and Happy Little Boozer and tell everything to fuck off and enjoy yourself.

p1218
(lp1219
VEquilibrium's a great one, as is Korpiklaani. If you don't mind a little change of scene and mood, Alestorm eschews the viking/nordic schema for a more pirate-inspired one. Alestorm is folk metal in a very different way from how tyr is folk metal, though: because they draw from sea shanties rather than traditional European folksongs, the end result is a tad different. 
p1220
aVCan't recommend Equilibrium enough.   They are one of my favourite bands of all.
p1221
aVI can never get enough of [this fucking song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Cp3JOMt1xU)
p1222
aVAlestorm also has an album about them kicking viking ass soooooo yeah.
p1223
aVThey literally call our Gods worthless in the song "Back Through Time". It really pissed me off, to be honest. \u000a\u000aEDIT: So I see that the immature who cannot bear to see an opinion contradictory to their own have infiltrated even this subreddit. Much more the pity for the rest of us. 
p1224
aVThanks!
p1225
aVWintersun. Being headed by Ensiferum's former singer, it's very similar to earlier Ensiferum, at least the first album (simply Wintersun). While they pick up a style more their own in their second album (Time I). In any case, it's pretty magnificent. 
p1226
aVThanks for the suggestions I really liked the sound of wintersun!
p1227
aVI'd probably go with Turisas for the battle/epicness factor. \u000aEluveitie might be similar to what you want too
p1228
aVAlright ill check them out. Thanks!
p1229
aVHeidevolk has some songs similar to Tyr, the slower, cleaner stuff mostly
p1230
aVFinntroll fits on the spectrum somewhere. They're something like blackened folk metal. Definitely a must listen for any folk metal fan!
p1231
aVTry Heathen Foray.
p1232
aVKill them for me! Bring me their skulls!
p1233
aVNo mercy?, I just listened one or two times that album. I'm more familiarized with Armored Bards, I love that album.
p1234
aVYep. I'm more of an Inner Light fan.
p1235
aVFor something a bit proggy like Týr, I's say Myrath.  They are a progressive folk metal band from Tunisia with that general "Arabian" sound.  For something epic like Ensiferum but a bit more blackened and with also a different ethnicity influence, there's Tengger Cavalry who are Chinese and have a general Mongolian theme.  For something more traditional in the folk metal world (By which I mean Nordic, specifically Finnish) Moonsorrow is hard to go wrong with on the epicness scale and the newest albums from Turisas and Alestorm are a bit experimental and contain some of the kind of progressive tendencies that you might associate with Týr.
p1236
aVGlittertind are similar to tyr in a way, also check out Skalmold and Finntroll

aVOh thats pretty sweet, thanks!

aVEluveitie makes use of a lot of tradition folk tunes in their songs.  Chrigel, the band's lead vocalist and songwriter, put together a list of some of the tunes that they used [here](http://forum.eluveitie.ch/viewtopic.php?p=43476&amp;highlight=#43476).\u000a\u000aAs you can see, the tune is known as En Dro (or An Dro) and it's an old Breton dance tune.   The name apparently means "The Turn," which can be a little misleading because it can be used to describe a style of dance rather than the tune itself -- that means you'll probably find other tunes given the same name because they were used for the same style of dance.\u000a\u000aEdit: Case in point: Eluveitie have a track called [Andro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfjtZMCu-ZE) on their first album.  Same name because it's the same type of dance, but a different source tune.\u000a\u000aI found a few instances of other people performing their versions of this specific tune:\u000a\u000a* [Robert Culbertson doing a cool arrangement of the tune on a Chapman Stick]  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTS2yF3ljwQ)\u000a\u000a* [A sample from a traditional band called Gallowglass performing their arrangement](http://www.amazon.com/Danse-Dro-Breton-Circle-Dance/dp/B001H5U49O)\u000a\u000a\u000a

On the cleaner vocal + less metal side: some Dalriada (try the Ígéret album), Arkona, and Tyr. Some of that is on the lighter side, but we are talking about a small-ish subgenre here.\u000a\u000aFor some reason I keep wanting to say Amon Amarth. No traditional instruments, but the sound just kind of fits in with the heavier folk metal bands. Definitely one of my favorites.
p1314
aVYeah I do like their latest track but most of Eluveitie's music I find a bit too aggressive like I said in the OP, plus I'm not keen on female vocals for the most part.\u000a\u000aKorpiklaani haven't got any grunts and that's what I like to hear :P. I do like some FInntroll and I love Northland. \u000a\u000aOf course I know Amon Amarth haha I've not lived under a rock for years. They're a bit too simple and samey for my tastes personally.
p1315
aVTry Wolfchant. Their album A Pagan Storm is a great album for what your looking for. 
p1316
aVYeah they seem pretty good but I've never got into them. I'll give em another go around.
p1317
aVIdk if Heidevolk fit your needs, but their earlier stuff is pretty kickass, and since they sing in Dutch it doesn't sound like clean vocals at all!
p1318
aV[Brymir-Unconquerable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0XdgTq7jU)\u000a\u000aMore symphonic than traditional, but i assure you they are what you're looking for.
p1319
aVAlready a fan haha thanks though
p1320
aVThe Last Desperate 10 Years As Ever is a pretty good melodic death metal album using Korean traditional instruments, by Oathean - an otherwise mediocre band. Well... Ten Days in Lachrymation was pretty decent too, but it has no folk influences.
p1321

p1323
aVYou can look at [Tengger Cavalry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxXxx-_GNbA) but they're Chinese and influenced by traditional Mongolian music rather than pagan or Celtic, etc. sounding influences so it's likely they might not be your thing at all.  But they are different from every other folk metal band I've come across which is good as a lot of folk metal bands don't get very creative and go for more or less the same type of sound.

p1335
aVYeah they're great, I'm from England as well and I used to live in York so I saw them a couple of times. There's a really nice folk metal scene in the north of England. Not sure if you've heard of Warhorns, but it's a pretty badass folk metal festival every year in York.
p1336
aVNo I ain't heard of that. Damn I come from South East so I'm pretty much out the way haha

aVYou might try StriboG. They are kinda like Ensiferum and Equilibrium combined. I personally don't listen to them much, but they might just be your thing.

aVWut.
p1354
aVThat's a very funny impression to have.
p1355
aVI don't know why I did.
p1356
aVWhat everyone else said, but also... harsh vocals aren't typically referred to as "screamo."  Screamo stems from Scream + Emo, Emo having very emotional lyrics and not always neatly in one genre or the other, it's more a lyrical content descriptor.  Contrast [a folk metal song with harsh vocals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FP_yFIvQgo) with what Wikipedia tells me is [a Screamo song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqS5Fo9j7BA).  I don't think you deserve the downvotes for what appears to be an honest mistake.  Hope you like Týr as they are my absolute favorite band!
p1357
aV'Tis why i said "quote unquote."
p1358
aVOn top of the other suggestions, I really like Metsatöll. A lot of people who I've shown them to complain about the vocals because they aren't auto-tuned or anything, but I think it makes the music sound more real.

aVI'm surprised nobody has mentioned Elvenking here. 
p1362
aVElvenking seems to me like it's midway between power metal and folk metal, they're great but I don't know if they're strictly folk metal. I could be entirely wrong, this is just based off of what they sound like.

aVOtyg.  For me, Folk Metal begins and ends with Otyg.  It might be a little dated for all the kids and Johnny-come-latelies (their albums are from 1998-1999), but it doesn't get any better than those Swedes.  Early Vintersorg (from 2000 and earlier) is great too, and shares some band members, but they may or may not appeal to you as the vocals are more varied.\u000a\u000aStorm's Nordavind (1995) and Cruachan's Folk-lore (2002) should also meet your requirements, and please your ears.
p1366

aVDefinite bonus, there.\u000a
p1376
aVThere are lots of German bands that only use clean vocals. Bands like In Extremo, Subway to Sally, Saltatio Mortis, Letzte Instanz, etc.
p1377
aVSo, I'll ask again since it came up.  Do Mittelalter metal and Mittelalter rock (c'mon, Letzte Instanz isn't quite metal, but still wonderful) belong here or on a different sub?
p1378
aVNever thought I'd see Saltatio Mortis here, I'm not sure how to describe them but they're fun to listen to (what are they singing about overall? Help?) I recommend Subway To Sally and Faun too. (I wish I could find decent translations of songs,  I want to understand what they are singing about!)\u000a\u000aEdit words
p1379
aVYeah, I don't know exactly how to classify them. They seemed somewhat relevant though. \u000a\u000aRegarding Subway To Sally song translations, google gave me this: http://lyricstranslate.com/en/subway-sally-lyrics.html \u000a\u000aI haven't used the site, my German is good enough to read lyrics, so I don't know how accurate it is.

p1381
aVElvenking, Týr. I know Eluvietie has some songs with "clean" vocals, but I haven't listened to all their stuff, so maybe they have an album of all clean vocals? I'm not sure

asVYour thoughts on clean/harsh vocals in folk metal?
p1442
(lp1443
V[deleted]
p1444
aVI prefer cleans in Folk metal (see 'Where His Ravens Fly - Falkenbach,  Wanderer - Ensiferum). It feels more... traditional, like a story being told. That being said, I do not dislike harsh vocals.
p1445
aVI agree. I don't dislike growling but I prefer Folk to have clean vocals since I view it as being bard like. 
p1446
aVI lean towards harsh when I'm listening to metal, but whatever fits with the music best.
p1447
aVI love some good cleans, but I prefer higher pitched voices in both men and women, unless there is a completely obvious "viking" feel to the music. Moonsorrow and Enslaved (not *really* folk metal but whatever) do this really well.\u000a\u000aI do prefer harsh vocals, but the harsh vocals in a lot of folk metal tend to be pretty bad, so I'm not usually too picky about it. Again, Moonsorrow is my favourite, but I find bands like Arkona and Emerald Night use theirs sparingly and really well.\u000a\u000aPrimordial I guess falls under the category of folk-influenced metal, seeing as they've got a mostly pagan/black metal feel to them, but their vocalist has easily the best clean and harsh vocals in that style IMO.
p1448
aVEnslaved aren't Folk? Well, humph. I've always thought of them as a badass Folk/Black band. \u000a\u000a(Pointed sarcasm here.) 
p1449
aVOne of my favorite harsh vocalists in all of folk metal is the guy from Suidakra. I can't fuckin remember his name now.
p1450
aVI disagree. . .I think folk metal should have clean vocals and the abundance of harsh vocals in folk metal ruins a lot of the modern bands for me.\u000a\u000aBut I grew up on Skyclad and Mago de Oz. For newer fans, which is seemingly all of /r/folkmetal, it's been Ensiferum/Finntroll, etc. So I understand the preference for harsh vocals.
p1451
aVI used to hate harsh vocals. I got into folk metal with Korpiklaani and Elvenking. But as I grew older and explored more metal, the more I despised most clean vocalists :P Not all of course, Tom Waits, Myles Kennedy, and admittedly Matt Sanders (avenged sevenfold) are all amazing to me. But when it comes to folk metal I like to hear harsh vocals. Just suits it for me.
p1452
aVThe harsh vocals that I really, really like are those along the lines of Svartsot and the deep/cookie monster-esque vocals. Eluveitie is another exception, but I don't really consider it folk as much as it is melodic death metal with folk instruments.\u000a\u000aFor example, I love Equilibrium, but I can't stand the vocals. Same goes for Korpiklaani and Finntroll. . .I try to actively avoid them at festivals now because I really can't stand watching them anymore (though they're super cool guys to drink with).
p1453
aVI really like songs that combine both clean and harsh vocals. My favorite is when they're both sang simultaneously. If a band does a lot of their music in only one vocal style I start to get bored of listening to them.  \u000aAnd I've always preferred growls to higher pitched shrieks. I can't stand it when harsh vocals are high pitched.

aVAgreed. I like manly grunts!
p1456
aV*Oh my...*
p1457
aVlol only just realized the connotations
p1458
aVI like both, if they are good.\u000a\u000aFolk Metal is one of these genres where there is a lot of crap, but the good stuff really shines.\u000a\u000aUsing Finntroll as examples (as the fellow in the current top post mentioned, I think it really makes for a great album when we have songs like Galgasang in between harsher tracks.
p1459
aVBoth.
p1460
aVI'm sort of the same way as you OP. However, it depends for me. Depending on who is singing, I sometimes don't mind clean vocals. I suppose it depends on the mood I'm in. But, for some reason I never usually mind clean lyrics when they are sung in another language. Not sure why. 
p1461
aVActually yeah I think I can see that. With some styles I'd much prefer if it were foreign.
p1462
aVI like both, but I lean towards clean. What's #1 for me, though, is the instrumentals behind the vocals. Eluveitie was too growly/screamy to me at first, but the great music behind it kept me coming back. Now I like the harsh vocals, but it has to blend with the music, and still be somewhat intelligible. Bands that scream for the sake of screaming (especially if they don't have lyrics) sound stupid to me. I hate Trollfest.
p1463
aVI agree that in all melodic music with harsh vocals, the instrumentation is key.  The harsh vocals are more equal with the instruments and you'll commonly find the harsh vocals accompanied by a melodic line that "makes up" for the lack of clear melody in the vocal line.  
p1464
aVI mean I know Alestorm and Korpiklaani are "clean" in Metal terms, but their vocals are both "harsh" in their singing style.  They are more half-spoken, half-sung.  \u000a\u000aI personally love clean vocals, particularly female vocals, as found in bands such as Eluveitie and Battlelore.  \u000a\u000aHowever, Folk metal is definitely predominantly harsh black-metal-esque vocals, which I personally think suit the tone of the music perfectly.  
p1465
aVI like a healthy mixture of both, too much growling and it seems a bit too much like it's just noises with no meaning, but without any harshness it seems like it looses it's "metalness", if you know what I mean.
p1466
aVHave you heard of leshak? They're a Russian death folk band, with those growls of unearthly proportion. 
p1467
aVI have. Admittedly I'm not a big fan of their music. Found it too sinister and metally and not folky enough. Definitely brutal growls though. 
p1468
aVIt's not for everyone. Just thought I'd mention them. 
p1469
aVI really enjoy folk metal when it is upbeat, and for that reason I tend to enjoy the clean vocals more. Folk Metal is just a metal genre that makes me feel really happy and adventurous, so I don't like when it's too harsh. :)
p1470
aVSome of the most uplifting songs I've ever heard have harsh vocals :P I don't think they're mutually exclusive
p1471
aVThen I guess it's all subjective! :P
p1472
aVDefinitely clean vocals for me, almost all the way. [Falconer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh9frx4R38k), mid and later [Skyclad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dLARkGkMbM) - I know that Martin's [thrashy voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS5OPo2v18w) isn't technically harsh, but it's definitely not clean and beautiful like on [The Answer Machine?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwlRmv8TEWA), and [Týr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu2bgwcv43o). However, I do like the occasional growl or whatever in my folk metal, specifically with [Battlelore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnQ46dk2vY0). (Maybe not folk metal at all, actually)\u000a\u000aNow, I personally don't see Alestorm as folk metal at all. As such, they're a power metal band and they have power metal singing, which makes sense to me. Although to be fair, much of the 'folk-metal' I like is really power metal anyway (Falconer and Týr's later albums come to mind). Then, there is the matter of Mittelalter Rock or Metal, which in general has clean vocals (I've actually never seen it with growled vocals). [Faun - Tanz mit mir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK5MdsewTjM) and \u000a[Saltatio Mortis - Früher war alles besser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8yF9zqlpR4) are examples, not technically metal, but still on the heavier end of the folk-rock spectrum.\u000a\u000aI really like the idea of the growls sounding earthy, that's a really interesting thing to think about. In general, I don't really listen to Folk Metal like that, I think, so maybe I'm missing out. For me, folk metal is not about nature or anything, but more about the beat and the sound of the music, which is why I really like Falconer and Skyclad.
p1473
aVI would say that saltatio mortis is folk metal. It has folk instruments, is inspired by folk music and is metal. What makes it not metal to you? and oh god I love faun.
p1474
aVI personally do think of them as metal, for the most part, but the line between rock and metal becomes rather blurred. As such, I think it's more helpful to list them as Mittelalter Rock/Metal, since I'd like to consider Faun and Saltatio Mortis as part of the same sort of genre, even though one is more metal/heavier rock. Altogether, Saltatio Mortis just doesn't have the heaviness, in my mind, to make it really objectively folk metal. That isn't any slight against it or anything, nor does that mean there's any problem with posting it here, I just think of them more as hard rock with folk influences.
p1475
aVFor folk metal, most of my favorite bands growl or scream, but there are a few amazing ones that do mostly clean vocals. Falconer and Elvenking are two of my favorites. I prefer the stuff that has a good mix of both like Ensiferum, OLD Turisas and Craving.
p1476
aVI love death metal but Folk is something where I prefer clean vocals. Tyr is my favorite band right now and I just love their style. Through them I found Alestorm and Korpiklaani and I love there music. I especially love Rummplugged. I think of growls more as demonic and Folk is more worldly and close to nature. 
p1477
aVI prefer clean vocals, but growls are okay as long as they aren't too excessive.
p1478
aVI prefer a healthy mix of both 
p1479
aV[deleted]
p1480
aVI feel exactly the opposite, im tired of growls and much prefer clean vocals. I wish more bands sounded like Alestorm and Korpiklaani.
p1481
aVYeah, I love clean chants, but it's all about the harshness for me. I feel the same way. 
p1482
aVyeah like the manly chanting in Segervisa by Manegarm or Fard by Grimner!

asVTurisas2013: your thoughts and opinions.
p1753
(lp1754
VI think it's fantastic. Definitely a grower like someone else mentioned. It's hard to put aside expectations and preconceived notions, especially for a bands fourth album, but if you can do that, the album truly shines. To me, this is the logical continuation of Battle Metal. The Varangian Way was totally different from Battle Metal, then Stand Up And Fight was a continuation of TVW stylistically and even partly thematically, and now I think Turisas2013 is what their second album would've been if TVW and SUAF had never happened, if that makes any sense. It's definitely "out there", but its out there in a refreshing way. I always felt like Mathias was using the folk element and the historical element as a metaphor for modern life. Like, "Battle Metal" itself, do you listen to it before you charge off into a literal battle and chop off heads? Probably not. You listen to it and apply those themes to your modern life. On SUAF, they started to drop the historical metaphor halfway, and it just came out strange to me. For example, on "Fear The Fear" they have the line that goes "Bravery, As we've all seen on TV, Explosions and swords, Hot girls in reward" which, in the context of all the folky and historical lyrics on most of the other tracks, just makes you scratch your head and say "what the fucks going on here?". The mixing of historical and modern wasn't the best idea. On Turisas2013, I feel like they dropped the metaphors 100%, and went for pure, unfiltered messages. Instead of hearing "The Great Escape" and applying what someone did hundreds of years ago to modern life, they went with "Into The Free", which has got to be one of the most relatable songs I've ever heard. Just think, you could apply that to any modern situation, quitting a job, graduating school, dumping a bad girl/boyfriend, anything. So instead of bogging everything down in history, which I'm sure comes with a lot of research for the authenticity, they skipped all that and went straight for the message. Anyway, I feel like I rambled enough here, I just thought I'd add my two cents about what I feel like the band was going for, since 4 out of 5 people I know who dislike the album but love Turisas simply "don't get it", it seems like.
p1755
aVAgree mostly, but have you seen their new video for [Ten More Miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhgsqSBHA6M)? While the lyrics aren't modern, the video's themes definitely are.
p1756
aVExactly! That video pretty much shows what I feel they're going for. Take the historical trappings and apply it to modern society.
p1757
aVI think it's their weakest album yet, but it's not bad. It's a grower though, as I've liked it more as I've listened to it more.
p1758
aVI think I'm really only dissapointed in the album because of the masterpieces that were Battle Metal and The Varangian Way. Nonetheless, the album lacked the epicness of Mathias' past efforts and the songs are a bit cheesy, even for Turisas. As a whole, the album wasn't terrible, but I doubt I'll listen to it much more. Also, Olli could have gotten way more violin exposure on the album. I would still give almost anything to see/meet them again, and they will remain one of my favourite bands.
p1759
aVThey're certainly the best live band I've ever seen, their performances are spectacular.  Lol "cheesy even for Turisas".
p1760
aVOnce you don't listen to "For your own good" and "Run bhang", it's not a bad album.  It's different, even fun at times.  I don't really dig the drums at all, though.  The beats are too undefined and punk-y for me to really get into.   \u000a\u000aIn all honesty, the album sound incomplete to me.  There were a lot of poor choices made, such as that whack background yeller in "Into The Free" and "No Good Story..."  Mildly disappointed, hoping some other good folk metal albums come out this year ***looking at you, Tyr.***
p1761
aV~~God~~ Odin I can't wait for Valkyrja.
p1762
aVI still... **STILL ** hate the name of this album (which is no reason to dislike the album itself, *of course*). \u000a\u000aI've come to enjoy the album, it's not the Folk Metal that we've been used to in Battle Metal and The Verangian Way...and yes, the only reason I originally bought this album was to keep up to date with owning all the Turisas albums (as they are one of my favorite bands).\u000a\u000aHowever, it's not a bad album, it's different and could in agreement with other comments, could do with more folky themes. But it's still definitely still Turisas..and for that, I'd still personally class this as an *above average* album in the world of music.  \u000a\u000aNeeds more epic, orchestral tunes in my opinion, more exposed individual instruments in which they excelled with in the early albums.\u000aThoroughly enjoy the album though, as a new concept, interested to see where they do go from here. \u005cm/ 
p1763
aV"Nope... Sounds Dildos." - Skwisgaar Skwigelf\ufeff\u000a\u000aTurisas had that rare talent of taking metal and adding a generous sprinkling of epic to it. Now they're just trying to sound epic without the metal. It's like a fuck-ton of frosting without the actual cake. Yeah, we all like frosting but it has to go *on* something. Most of their new stuff since "Varangian Way" just sounds like rejected "Lord of the Rings" soundtracks.
p1764
aVThat's the danger in becoming a wildly popular headlining band after only one album.  People love Battle Metal and then loved Varangian Way, but they hadn't really established themselves yet.
p1765
aVHeh, yeah, and now they have to contend with all the 'oldskool' pricks who don't understand that as a band evolves, so does their music.\u000aAhh well, Devin Townsend's new stuff grew on me, maybe this will as well.
p1766
aVAmon Amarth has 9 amazing albums that are all practically the same.  I'm all for a band evolving, but I'm not going to continue supporting a band that evolves to the point where it's unrecognizable and not good anymore.  Not that Turisas has specifically done this.
p1767
aVYou may like [this](http://youtu.be/paFSKfPaz30) video then.
p1768
aVI completely agree. I'm not one of those fans that hates when a band tries to add to their sound, but this isn't evolution. It's like Battle Metal and The Varangian Way were A steak dinner and the next two albums were the deuces dropped the next morning.
p1769
aVIt is certainly a step up from Stand Up And Fight, which was very lackluster compared to their first two albums, but the album has it's flaws. I felt like it could have been a lot more powerful if they had spent more time on songs like For Your Own Good. Overall though, it's a step in the right direction from Stand Up And Fight.
p1770
aVStand Up and Fight is my favorite Turisas album. Why do you feel it's lackluster?
p1771
aVBattle Metal and The Varangian Way both had a real power to them. In Stand Up And Fight I felt like they were deliberately trying to decrease that. Stand Up And Fight had a few good songs, but overall it felt weaker than the first two.
p1772
aVI like Turisas. I dislike the album.\u000aThe songs are okay. Not good, not bad.
p1773
aVI love it. Not a song I didn't like. Took a few listens to get into, but I'm definitely a fan.
p1774
aVI feel ya. Although I do find myself skipping 'Run, Bhang-Eater, Run!' a lot. It just felt like a much weaker "In The Court Of Jarisleif", and even though I'm twenty seven, the porno sounds in my headphones still make me uncomfortable. I hated when Manowar did it, I hated when White Zombie did it, I hate when Turisas does it.\u000a\u000a

aVYeah, I guess that would be my least favorite song. And the moaning was a turn-off for me. Felt completely unnecessary. But it's only a few seconds. Not nearly as bad as when Zombie did it. But that's probably the low point of the album. As such, I can't really complain.
p1776
aVI entirely agree.  Sex noises pretty much relegate a song from ever being played in the car or out loud.  It's also probably the weakest song on the album as well.
p1777
aVI dont like it that much. I do plan on writing a review on it so i can get a better perspective on it
p1778
aVAside from the fiasco that is 'Run, Bhang-Eater, Run!' and the hyperspeed 'March of the Varangian Guard' chorus in 'No Good Story Ever Starts With Drinking Tea,' I think it's a pretty good album.  Not as good as their previous efforts, but still good.  Greek Fire has to be one of my favorite Turisas songs so far.
p1779
aVGreek Fire is really awesome, honestly though, I love the Alvin and the Chipmunks style Guards of Glory...
p1780
aVLike people said before, it's definitely a grower. The problem I have with it though is that every song, even the ones that I think are the best off the album, has *one* part or sound or SOMETHING that just kills it for me. Like the weird ass yelling or moaning or sped up stuff, it just makes it something that isn't as listenable. 
p1781
aVLike the softcore porn in Run Bhang Eater Run.
p1782
aVYeah that pretty much murdered any chance the album had of being played out loud in my car
p1783
aV It is great as an album, but strange as a Turisas album.
p1784
aVI personally think "The Varangian Way" is their weakest album despite having some really good songs.  I personally enjoy the last two albums far more than the first two primarily because I felt the first two had a lot of hit and miss.  Some songs were great, but some were duds with constant "symphonic pauses" that killed any momentum the song had going for it.  \u000a\u000aWhile many people hate "For Your Own Good" I actually really like it; but not as a folk metal song.  If you're looking for folk metal; you'll be disappointed but if you're a fan of bombastic symphonic metal with a good lather of power metal, I think "FYOG" holds up really well.  \u000a\u000aIt definitely grows on you.
p1785
aVI can understand that.  I love some Turisas songs but I find I can't really listen through their whole albums.  They have a very peculiar style that I really crave on occasion, but I tire of fast.
p1786
aVPersonally I like it. It's very different but simply fun. I don't think it's to be taken to seriously, rather a bit (read very) tongue-in-cheek. Piece by Piece is also one of my favourite Turisas songs to date.
p1787
aVI fucking hate this album. I hated most of Stand Up and Fight too. The Varangian Way was a master piece, this new shit sounds like they're trying to make radio music.

aVCeltibeerian is NOT exactly like Alestorm, but I believe if you like Upbeat Folk Metal, they're the band to try. **They are heavily influenced by alestorm, actually, I forgot about that.** :D in addition to other up-beat bands like Riagu (poster below) suggested. Korpiklaani is a big influence on them\u000a\u000aHere is their youtube channel. Please give them a shot. They are a small band who deserve a bigger audience. I heard them for the first time and then within weeks I was on track to buying their two cds when I normally download everything.

aVGuys, Amon Amarth isn't viking metal. It's viking themed Death metal, the band has even stated that themselves. Not saying it isn't kickass workout music because it is.

aVOkay  I understand the distinction between Viking metal and Viking themed  Melo-death, but how closely are we adhering to theme if we're talking Nightwish and Korpiklaani? (both favorite bands of mine btw, but not viking related) And I'd understand why you'd include Ensiferum, but if we're going to be pedantic, they're not actually viking themed either. Finnish mythology is distinct from the Norse.  \u000a\u000a
p1964
aVI assume the name came about because of what they sing about and how there "showmanship" reflects in there music, it appears very nordic regardless on if it truly is or not. my opinion i honestly have no idea.
p1965
aVWell the name is a Latin word that means sword bearer. Finnish history and mythology is every bit a violent as the Swede's , Dane's, and Norwegians, but they mythology Ensiferum reference s has nothing to do with the Norse gods.

p1982
aVNeed a song to get you pumped? Here's the one: http://youtu.be/OZECY3zFQQQ
p1983
aVMy suggestions:\u000a\u000aTyr - Shadow of the Swastika\u000aEnsiferum - One more magic potion\u000aTurisas - Portage to the Unknown\u000aAmon Amarth - Guardians of Asgaard\u000a\u000aAnd not viking metal but Born in a Mourning Hall by Blind Guardian is a really good fast song.
p1984
aVWithin Temptation, Leaves Eyes, and Delain are worth checking out, but I wouldn't say very many of their songs are "pump up." \u000a\u000aI second Heidevolk. \u000a\u000aTherion would be good to check out, particularly "Gothic Kabbalah." \u000a\u000aSabaton and Powerwolf go surprisingly well with those bands, and are extremely good for work-out, but it is power metal, not viking or folk. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVForgot, not really folk metal but Subway To Sally - Tanz auf dem Vulkan\u000a\u000aCan't spell at 3am, rough translation: Dancing on volcanoes (or something, from a crappy translation I read, I wish I took German in high school). That's pretty "metal", imo.\u000a\u000aI walk around listening to this all the time. The song goes faster than I can walk. :/

aVI really love [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yHsmZy-YS8), it's Skálmöld and the Iceland Symphony Orchestra.  Skálmöld is great by their lonesome as well.
p1997
aVIn terms of Viking metal, you're pretty much missing the one [obvious choice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plX6ZoO8v8w).
p1998
aVSeriously, how does anyone have a viking metal list without Amon Amarth? By far the most notable.
p1999
aVPossibly because Amon Amarth isn't viking metal
p2000
aVActually it's the very definition of it. Viking themed metal. "Viking" is not a musical aesthetic. So yes, they absolutely are.
p2001
aVThat's not really how I understand it. I understand viking metal as being a fusion between folk and black metal with lyrical themes surrounding vikings and such. Considering that definition Amon Amarth is clearly not viking metal. But that's just my interpretation of it so I respectfully disagree with you...
p2002
aVThere is this stupid thing where there are a lot of bands that have a different sound than Amon Amarth (Black Metal influences, mainly) that sing about Viking stuff too, and because they came first, they got to define Viking Metal. Amon Amarth sings viking themed lyrics, but musically they're a form of Death Metal or Melodeath, not Black metal.

aVI know right! its weird cause he has kinda slowly changed over the years from playing guitar to just vocals. I think Manala showed a great change in his voice and it was really fresh. I'm really looking forward to his album.\u000a\u000aI got the feeling he was quite a timid guy, I got the chance to meet Korpi when I was in Australia and he was a pretty quiet guy off stage but really relaxed and down to earth. I had this little wooden pendant I made years back with the shaman logo on it and just carried it everywhere like a traveling charm because of the whole journey man thing, I had it at the gig and gave him it and he was really appreciative. I bumped into him after the gig and he was wearing it attached to his necklace(s) and I almost totally geeked out but managed to wait till he had went away before I almost lost it. It was a great feeling and awesome seeing them live and meeting them.\u000a\u000aI hope he tours solo, do you think he will?

asVAlan Stivell - Tri Martolod (sounds almost EXACTLY like Eluveite's Inis Mona, recorded 1972 Celtic folk song)
p2054

VThat's actually a Breton traditional song. Eluveitie use TONS of traditional tunes in their albums, specially Breton and Irish tunes (as far as I can tell). And this is actually the main reason why I enjoy this band so much.\u000a\u000aSome other examples:\u000a\u000a[La Jument de Michao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ntk_4yHuPg) --&gt; [Luxtos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pdGLsFjRSM)\u000a\u000a[Morrison's Jig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8U0GCtcgzM) --&gt; [Tegernakô](http://youtu.be/20SsyQjxc74?t=5m14s)\u000a\u000a[Dr. Gilbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfLK-r26aYg) --&gt; [From Darkness](http://youtu.be/Q7D4cKieSk8?t=2m8s)\u000a\u000a[Cooley's Reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njgAjaAGebw) --&gt;[Tarvos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqHbpappzwU)\u000a\u000aand the list goes on...
p2056
aVI recognize the outro on "Origins" as [Archibald MacDonald of Keppoch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIfW1cZCQM).\u000a\u000aDoes anyone happen to know the tune from the [Epilogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAse_w6OWnI) on "Helvetios"?  It's a favorite of mine. \u000a
p2057
aVI don't know which is the tune from *Epilogue*. There's a thread in [Eluveitie's website forum](http://eluveitie.ch/forum/) where its users compile the tunes used by the band, I looked it up but I didn't find out anything there about that tune in particular. If you are really desperate to know, I guess you can try and ask there.
p2058
aVYup, same melody. Lots of folk metal musicians use really, really old melodies that have existed for a long time. I don't mind it as long as the artistic integrity is still respected. Similar melodies can also be found in the intro of [Rose for Epona - Eluveitie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z89WI96MzZc) and [Metropolice - Blood Stain Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQhRS-4NXiE)
p2059
aVThanks, yeah, I didn't mean to imply I hate them because of it or anything. That seems to be the whole point of folk metal - translating traditional folk music to something modern without losing the accessibility and catchiness. I was just surprised by the fact that I didn't read about this in any review/interview etc.

aVThis is my favorite ensiferum song which is saying a lot because I love everyone of them. (Except celestial bond)! 
p2102

p2103
aVWhy don't you like celestial bond?
p2104
aVI'm always down for a slower, softer ensiferum song but it seemed to lack any cool ensiferum traits and stopped the momentum of all the other amazing songs on the album. 
p2105
aVTo me, Celestial Bond was one of the few songs on Unsung Heroes I actually was impressed by - the album seemed very lackluster compared to the last. (Although there were a few good songs.)
p2106
aVYeah. I have never hyped up an album so much, and when it came out in my sword I trust and burning leaves were still my favorites and I was pretty disappointed but then after listening to it more times than I can count I was amazed by all the songs (minus celestial unfortunately) especially passion proof power but I'll give it another listen too after hearing what you've said.

VKivimetsan Druidi may not be a top name like Korpiklaani or Finntroll, but I'd say they're still pretty well known- they toured with all the big names a few times in the last few years xd Nice song though :D
p2118
aVWell, he said "lesser known", not unknown. \u000a\u000aI hadn't heard of them before this thread (and I have heard of Korpiklaani and Finntroll), so by that measure alone they are lesser known! 
p2119

p2120
aVThis is SO GOOD. There is nothing like discovering a band that just CLICKS. Thanks, OP. This is a good day. I love discovering more folk that doesn't have just growled or screamed vocals. I love those bands, but I love the real folkish/folky bands as well.

aVIt's brilliant, isn't it? I mean, they do get into slightly harsher vocals, but it fits with the song itself. I love the diversity of metal...
p2124
aVI really think this band has some very high potential to create amazing music.  It's unfortunate that they have not made any (public) progress in recent years.  They are scheduled to have a 10th anniversary concert next month I believe.
p2125
aVDamn, this is fucking AWESOME. thanks for sharing.
p2126
aVHoly crap, it's been a long time since I've listened to them! The first album "Shadowheart" was very much meh. I'm glad they improved on their sound on this album. Nice, gotta try and get this one and listen to it.
p2127
aVI have their "Shadowheart" album and I was pretty underwhelmed and disappointed with it.  This song is a lot better, but I felt the Shadowheart album had very weak instrumental melodies which were too predictable and overall just not that interesting.\u000a\u000aI also feel that the mix was rather terrible (I guess that can be slightly forgiven as a first release) but also that the female vocalist overall detracted from the music.  It's good to hear she's improved, as on the Shadowheart album she was frequently missing the note and singing flat when large vocal leaps were required.  Of course this is all comes with experience, but Kivimetsan Druidi pretty much fell off my radar due to a weak first album.  \u000a\u000aGood to see them improving.
p2128
aVWas it definitely her? I thought she was a much newer member. I could be completely wrong, though.
p2129

asVELUVEITIE - The Call Of The Mountains (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO)
p2196
(lp2197
VLOL Ok, so I love Eluveitie, but over in /r/metal they were just talking about how Wintersun (another Nuclear Blast band) didn't have enough money from the label to record their album properly, and I look down and this song is recorded in *five* different languages, including Romansh, which I had not previously heard of (surprisingly, really). Along with a bunch of gorgeous music videos. \u000a\u000aI know this is total oversimplification, but it's interesting how labels decide where the money goes. 
p2198
aVI like the song, but my personal opinion is that Origins has been a little underwhelming in comparison to older Eluveitie albums. I hate to see their music get formulaic. I feel like they've lost their groove a bit, and have fallen into that cycle of "We have to produce this", rather than "We want to produce this". \u000a\u000aI'd like to see them make Evocation II. Switching gears for awhile making another acoustic album may be what they need to really turn things around.
p2199
aVI got a very mainstream metal vibe from this. Could've told me it was Evanescence and I wouldn't have questioned it (without the video).
p2200
aVThis could just be the "Rose for Epona" of the new album. It was the only song of its kind on Helvetios, and that was a great album. We'll see, I suppose.

VAwesome band. Severely underrated.
p2205
aVI love Forefather. As an Englishman myself, the nationalist elements do sometimes make me a tad uncomfortable, but it's really not that different to the standard ideas among folk and pagan metal; I'm just more in tune with some of the possible implications.\u000a\u000aThis is a great song though. I've participated a few times on the Saxon side at the official re-enactments of the Battle of Hastings, so it has a particular resonance for me.

Nine Treasures - [Nuutsai Chadal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa7PfYfmoEo)\u000a\u000aTheir vocals are "harsh clean", if that makes sense, he sort of mixes a throat-singing sound with regular singing and it sounds pretty awesome.\u000a

p2215
aVIs Finsterforst's vocalist Equilibrium's old singer? The voice sounds very familiar...
p2216
aVNo, but you're right, the vocals are quite similar. Finsterforst changed their vocalist for the last two albums though, so the album "Rastlos" and the new one that will come out soon have a different vocalist anyway ;)  \u000aTheir trademark, the accordeon, is in every album though, which is what I love most about them.

aVI too like clean vocals in my folk metal.\u000a\u000aAll of the above suggestions are great and you should also check out Tyr if you haven't already
p2220
aVWhere to start with Folk Metal? Why, where it all started of course!\u000a\u000a**Skyclad** - [Think Back and Lie of England](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dLARkGkMbM) [Building a Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3YXTAovqZs) [The Well Travelled Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOwxjxEwZgA) \u000a\u000aAs for the rest, it seems like you're a bit into power metal (Falconer and Alestorm), and I don't know exactly how familiar you are with that genre. As such, I'll just give a few (folky) recommendations.\u000a\u000a**Elvenking** - [The Loser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgzlOMVyL2g)\u000a\u000a**Blind Guardian** - [Skalds and Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3_S1Q40HZo) (Rather Falconer-y, I think)\u000a\u000a**Wuthering Heights** - [Too Great Thy Gift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO4b3CPI0vo)\u000a\u000a(We'veI've got plenty more at r/PowerMetal if you're interested :D)\u000a\u000aNext, we'll address Schaundmaul. So, Mittelalter-Rock/Metal is awesome, not sure how much of it you are aware of, but:\u000a\u000a**Faun** - [Diese kalte Nacht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGuY3Nin8yU) [Tanz mit mir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYKveN9Vj3M)\u000a\u000a**Saltatio Mortis** - [Wachstum über alles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTSitlFXEX8) [Früher war alles besser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8yF9zqlpR4) [Hochzeitstanz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouhufx2En4Y) (Alea has the worst hair ever, but whatever :D)\u000a\u000a**Santiano** - [Garten Eden / Scarborough Faire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqjL0j5N3l8)\u000a\u000a
p2221
aVOn the medieval point -Subway To Sally. I'm not sure what I'd recommend to start at though. The first song I heard by them was Wehe Stunde. (Thanks to some streaming radio app a few years ago.)\u000a\u000aIf you like Faun, Saltatio Mortis, and such you will *probably* like Subway To Sally.\u000a\u000aI just got into the more medieval stuff (via listening to Faun for awhile) a few months ago. The amount of new music you can find on streaming radio is amazing, depending on the app.\u000a\u000aOh yeah, if you're talking about the lead singer in Saltatio Mortis, yeah...I agree on awful hair, but the music is great. (I don't know the name of anyone in that band.)
p2222
aVOk, along the Medieval (or mittelalter in German) lines: Corvus Corax, Cultus Ferox, Schelmish, Dunkelschön, Potentia Animi, WirrWahr, Wolfenmond, Haggard, maybe even Tanzwut or Heimataerde (more electronic, but still folky).  In Extremo should probably be mentioned.  And, these are not medieval per se, but I would be remiss to leave out: Garmarna, Lumsk and Fejd.
p2223
aVyou are the only one to mention elvenking, why is that?  they were my introduction to folk metal and they are still one of my faves.  is it just because of how iffy some of their rescent entries have been? 
p2224
aVFor the most part, Elvenking is just power metal with violin. In general, it seems like most of r/folkmetal prefers music that is more like Metatsoll or Ensiferum. Less power and more atmospheric, in my experience.
p2225
aVyeah, i definitely get that from their last few albums.  but heathenreel and wyvern seem like really great albums for someone just starting in the genre to me.
p2226
aVTyr is a really good one.\u000a\u000aI actually started with Eluveitie and I hated harsh vocals back then. Listen to Arcane Evocation I which is acoustic and Anna Murphy does all the vocals. Then some songs which feature Anna's vocals (clean). Here's a list starting with 100% Anna's vocals too more of a balance between Anna and Chrigel (harsh vocals):\u000a\u000aCall if the Mountains\u000aA Rose For Epona\u000aVianna\u000aAlesia\u000aCeltos\u000aSlania's Song (Gaulish)\u000aLuxtos\u000a\u000a(There are obviously more but those are the notable ones to me)\u000a\u000aI ended up loving the rest of Eluveitie's song that the harsh vocals grew on me (and I detested them before).\u000a\u000aEDIT: typos
p2227
aVI'd suggest Heidevolk and Metsatöll. You also may like Eluveitie, although they do have harsh vocals, but also much in the ways of folk elements. 
p2228
aVYou wish you understood Heidevolk. Nederland meesterland. 
p2229
aVWhat? 
p2230
aVNot sure what this subreddit's general opinion of them is, but [Suidakra.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwgf5kRPNDo) Healthy mix of growls/screams and clean singing. [Here's a somewhat heavier track, too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ-4-tALTbw).
p2231
aVIf you like clean vocals I would also advise you to listen to Lumsk. Their latest album is less folk-ish, so you may prefer listening first to Det Vilde Kor and Troll.
p2232
aVIf you enjoy Schaundmaul, you should check out Faun. They are alsonot metal but very folky. Also since IM assuming the obvious ones like Korpiklaani and Eluviete are already being mentioned, let me suggest Tengger cavalry.
p2233
aVYou have a good start.  It's definitely good to cast your net wide and go around the world.\u000a\u000aFrom Finland, Korpiklaani and Finntroll are the godfathers of that country's scene and are must haves.  Also crucial to any folk metaller collection is Moonsorrow's "V: Hävitetty" album.  The atmosphere of that album (two songs, roughly 30 mins apiece) is fantastic, and its sheer awesomeness should mitigate any aversion to the vocal style. \u000a\u000aFrom across the bay in Estonia, Metsatöll is like a gnarlier and groovier Korpiklaani.  Lots of fun live\u000a\u000aFrom the rest of Scandinavia you get more of the Viking stuff.  TYR is definitely where you want to go here.  If you end up liking Moonsorrow, go for Thyrfing.  And to go old school, check out Bathory's "Hammerheart", which is the fountainhead of Viking metal.\u000a\u000aGermany has a big folk metal scene.  Falkenbach is a great viking outfit.  Equilibrium from Munich does big heroic folk, definitely start with their "Turis Fratyr" album.\u000a\u000aFrom Israel, start with Orphaned Land: great, proggy Middle Eastern-influenced metal with a very awesome theme.  Arafel plays real aggressive Russian/Ukrainian-influenced music, and I can't get enough of their newest album with Equilibrium's former vocalist.  Melechesh is not strictly folk, but its heavily Armenian/Assyrian folk-influenced black metal is pretty awesome you're in the mood for that.\u000a\u000aThough I was into them for awhile, I've gone cool on Eluveitie.  Primordial from Ireland is better Celtic folk, imho.\u000a\u000aAlso good: Skyforger (Latvia), Mägo de Oz (Spain), and Agalloch (Oregon).  Enjoy!
p2234
aVEquilibrium and Wintersun are a must although they breach genres. Both are incredibly symphonic and epic. Check out Time I for Wintersun and Sagas or Erdentempel for Equilibrium

aVMoonsorrow was the band to get me into the genre, back when I couldn't stand guttural vocals.  They're one of the few groups where their vocals don't overpower the instrumentals, so if one doesn't don't like 'em it doesn't detract too much from listening in my opinion.

aV"I'd like to see a band that is more representative of the values I find in folk metal"\u000a\u000aWhile some bands may just be in for fun and giggles, it's very common that their members be keen on reconnecting with folk culture. The use of traditional instruments is only half of it and right off the bat, I can't think of a band with no lyrics referring to their native lore and history. What you see in the picture is exactly that. These are core values in folk metal. \u000a\u000aIt's very telling of the cultural cleansing we've been put through over the past centuries that you see "evil/satanic themes" when someone dresses up as a mythical creature. That's where ridiculousness lies to me. 
p2298
aVI should have worded this differently and/or clarified better.  I do not see this pictures as being "evil" but I would fit it into the gimmicky area.  I really like Finntroll but just don't like this picture.  Just my opinion.
p2299
aVYou talk about the "light hearted" and "fun" atmosphere of Folk metal but then complain that they look silly.\u000a\u000aIf they were "light hearted" and "fun" wouldn't a comical look be fitting?  I totally disagree with the generalization of Folk metal as a light-hearted genre as many of my favorite bands I love because their music and lyrics convey their culture and atmosphere which is able to express deeper emotions; not because they occasionally sing drinking songs.\u000a\u000aEDIT: The banner is also probably old because this isn't a massive subreddit with constant traffic.  
p2300
aVI owe it more to a lazy mod. When he first posted it over a year ago he said he was going to change it every week to "feature" a different folk metal band.\u000a\u000aIt lasted one week. The first week.
p2301
aVWell when Finntroll toured the US  they abandoned the steam punk aesthetic for their older more traditional look. I guess the new outfits didn't go over well.

VI absolutely love and adore this track.  With Moonsorrow as a whole I feel like I must be missing something because I can't get into them no matter how many attempts they're given.  Folky, jolly tracks like "Kylän Päässä," "Pakanajuhla," and "Köyliönjärven Jäällä (Pakanavedet II)" are total beloved masterpieces; but little else has ever gained my favor.  Everything else is just too atmospheric, *epic*, and bland for my tastes.

(lp2316
VI fucking love this song. And I also am not a huge fan of alot of what Turisas has been doing lately. Never heard a song from Eluveitie I don't like though.
p2317
aVI can't figure out if i like this or not. Overall, it's great, but i'm not the biggest fan of their "softer stuff" (ie A Rose for Epona) which is how the song starts, but then it goes to the verse which is awesome and slightly better than the chorus. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK. Still a fantastic song with a kick ass solo
p2318
aVI've been a fan of both Turisas and Eluveitie for a number of years, and have developed my musical taste depending on both of these as founding bands in the "folk metal" genre. Enjoying both, for their similarities and differences. \u000a\u000aThe new Turisas album (Turisas2013 (What a DREADFUL NAME)) is good, but not in the same way as their previous (pre- Stand Up and Fight) albums. It seems to me that they are taking a more Jazzy/more popular approach to metal, which is completely up to them, the band. However I don't think that by any means the new album is "bad", it's a well crafted band, with obvious influences from their previous work and draws upon their experience as an evolving band. \u000a\u000aWithout upsetting too many, I think they are changing into a more mature band via a subtle progression through their most recent albums.\u000a\u000aI've seen both bands live (And enjoyed both INCREDIBLY). This is definitely a different sound for Eluveitie, more folky rather than the modern sound of Turisas. But as each band develops, it allows for more variety and differentiation amongst each other, creating more variety for listeners. \u000a\u000aAs we all know, Eluveitie does folk tunes very well. This song grabs the attention of those who enjoy their slower more peaceful songs, as well as those who enjoy the quit folk tunes. It's a good song and I am indeed enjoying both Turisas and Eluveitie's branching and experiments...broadening the horizons of Folk metal always seems like a good thing to me.\u000a\u000aI am looking forward to the next Ensiferum album (a massive amount) and hoping for a full album from Equilibium soon (Not just an EP)...oh yeah, and Time II would be nice too from Wintersun. \u000a\u000aCurrently waiting on my Turisas2013 album to arrive. Will possible post a lame review of it on the folk metal subreddit once I listen to it consistently for a few weeks, maybe. \u000a\u000aTLDR; Quite enjoy the new Turisas sound, this song is also pretty sweet. 
p2319
aVI do like Turisas' new album, but... well, not in the same way.  While this is clearly out of the ordinary for Eluveitie, considering their DM elements, it is still definitely Eluveitie.  Turisas' new sound is like they took SUAF and emptied it of all the Byzantine, Viking, and Folk from it.  It's no longer folk metal or Turisas to me.  So while I like it as an album, and as an individual work, it's no longer that good ol' Turisas we all know and love.\u000a\u000aEdit: Also, 'Run, Bhang Eater, Run!' is quite possibly the worst song in Turisas' repertoire.\u000a\u000aEdit 2: Still, Turisas2013 is growing on me...
p2320
aVI agree, I don't think i can consider Turisas folk metal anymore. And I also really hated Unsung Heroes. I'm still looking forward to the next Ensiferum album, but I'm not getting excited about it. It's their only album I can't stand, hopefully it's a fluke and their next one will be good.
p2321
aVProbably because its still pretty clearly folk metal. Clear hurdy gurdy, heavy guitars, a bit of aggressive vocals. But yes pretty poppy huh. 
p2322
aVI really hated all but one song on Helvetios (A Rose for Epona was an abomination of a song), and felt really disappointed by it. I haven't heard much of the new Turisas as I've been unable to order the album, but I doubt it could let me down as much as Helvetios did. This isn't a case of me not liking the 'softer stuff' as Evocation I is my favourite album, but I was so gutted by the direction they went in. Turisas I am more hopeful about. I guess I'll see.

p2348
aVIron Maiden period bands covered the themes - Vikings, war, paganism etc. Later bands developed on that kindof stuff.

It was one of those shows where at about the second song you turn to your friend and go "wait... who is this again?!" pretty much in awe because what they brought was not what you expected from a local band. \u000aUnlike most domestic folk/pagan metal bands they don't come across as '*pretending*' to be a folk/pagan metal band, if that makes sense.

p2619
aVHmm, I think it's just the more popular ones. Svarga has a male vocalist with female guest appearances. Rarog has a female vocalist but the main vocals are male. Oprich, Tverd, and Veda have both. Temnozor, Stozhar, Nevid' (more recently), Leshak, Krada, Izmoroz, Pagan Reign, Butterfly Temple are all male or mainly male vocals.\u000a\u000aThis is just what I can think of at the moment. xD
p2620
aVYou are really into russian folk metal...awesome, I haven't been able to find it at all. I'm learning russian at the moment, and I have been needing some of this stuff to listen to.
p2621
aVYeah, I was actually introduced to folk metal through some Russian and Ukrainian bands and it's generally the style I like most xd\u000a\u000aObviously metal-archives is the best place to find new music, but barring that, metalarea.org is great, the site is mainly in Russian though. mp3girls.ru is also good for finding bands with female vocals. \u000a\u000aAnd, cool! It's always nice to meet people learning Russian :D
p2622
aVOh, you are learning as well or do you ethnically speak russian? I enjoy the faroese and swedish style of folk metal. After completing my education in both of those languages, I figured I would do russian anf find some more folk. Ypu are quite helpful
p2623
aVNah, I studied it for years... I guess you could say I'm still learning though as I did lose a lot of it from disuse :p\u000a\u000aAnd I'm glad to be of help, I may post more Russian bands here soon :)
p2624
aVOh. Yeaa i lost a lot from disuse as well. I moved to the states when i was 9. It was really easy to losr it though. My father was american and nevet spoke russian again really afyer we moved. My mom is russian, but for the most part picked up english. My great grandmother lives in russia and shr doesnt soeak english, but i dont get to talk to her much and my mum had to help translate. Lol, she took a liking yo english curses though. Particularly "shit fire"
p2625
aV"Shit fire." Well, that's a colorful phrase xD\u000a\u000aAnd I see... on my mother's side my family has more recently immigrated, but my father's side has been in the US for a while, the latest on that side immigrating in the mid 1800s, and the German/French ancestry much earlier.

p2631
aVMy family is historically Slavic and central European (with some western, I'm a bit of a mutt), so I've always taken an interest in it. I probably would have studied Polish over Russian if it had been an option- my grandmother speaks Polish, but her children didn't want to learn when she tried to teach them, and now she refuses to speak it except with her old Polish friends. I've self-studied it somewhat but am very far from proficient. xd My girlfriend is from Poland and she tries to help, though :p

p2639
aVThe bards? An examples? I meant to say folk metal. I havent ever found russian folk metal that hasnt had a female singer. Was wondering why they are so popular in russia.

The Final Curtain was the last song written for the E.P. and clearly pointed towards where we were heading with "Ramshackle", and I'd always thought as "Circus of Misery" doing the same, even before we'd starting writing this album.

VI downloaded this album, and occasionally the singer would say "This is a recording off the new Alestorm album.  Remember, piracy is a crime!" dubbed over the music.\u000a\u000aI believe that this bootleg with the piracy warning is the definitive version of the album.
p2711
aV"Yarr, Yer listenin' to the new Alestorm album, "Black Sails at Midnight". This song is called, "Black Sails at Midnight". Remember, Piracy is a crime!"\u000a\u000aEven after buying the album, I keep a burned copy of the bootleg in the car, and I have to agree that this is the best version.\u000a\u000aYes I do have the warning memorized.
p2712
aVI know Napalm Records does that with all early press-release copies of albums. That way if a torrent or leak appears they tell that someone who they sent a copy of the album before its release had gone and leaked it on the internet. \u000a\u000aIt kind of bit them in the ass though because it's pretty hilarious to have a "Pirate" metal band saying "piracy is a crime, yarr!" and most people thought it was just intentionally part of the album when they downloaded it.
p2713
aVSuch a killer band there really needs to be more pirate metal around 
p2714
aVAgreed, Folk metal has focused too much on Vikings. We need to acknowledge the other epic seafarers as well!
p2715
aVWhile I agree that Alestorm, pirate metal and the theme in general are nothing short of awesome, I think that it would grow old real quick if many more bands would take a shot at it. Pirates lack the expansive universe with gods, myths, epic heros and great battles. At the end of the day it all comes down to rum, cannons, swords and wenches. Awesome in its own right of course, but not exactly something you can build a whole subgenre around without it growing boring real fast.
p2716
aVI do agree that there is not a whole lot that you can base a genre around But swashbuckler and Alestorm while differnt types of metal both fit into the Pirate sea songs and they are  both great
p2717
aVMuch better than the original. 
p2718
aVI don't think the children would agree:\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ju_10NkGY\u000a\u000a:)
p2719
aVDefinately my favorite band out there!....Can't wait to see them very soon!
p2720
aVYea, it's really too bad the band isn't as into it as their fans seem to be. I have a buddy who was in Folkearth and hung with the Alestorm guys a few times. I guess they like to refer to themselves "some shit pirate metal band" and almost none of them actually like metal all that much. This was a few years ago, and they were also supposedly relatively disillusioned by the fact that  that they were contracted for a four album deal, with only two out so far, and were heavily considering breaking up after the contract is up.\u000a\u000aNot sure how they feel nowadays, but they've been touring to the states a lot, and that's a good a sign imo.
p2721
aVI doubt that they are not into metal. At least the singer is. I was at a few festivals where they played and saw Chris(the singer) in the crowd at lot of bands' shows. 
p2722
aVThe singer also started a second goofy metal band (Gloryhammer), so I assume that he at least is into it. The keyboardist has looked pretty bored both times I've seen Alestorm live, but I suppose he really doesn't have much to do.
p2723
aVWhen they rolled through for Paganfest a few years ago I got to speak with Dani, their guitarist. One of the most genuine and nice people I've ever met, the whole 'were a shit pirate metal band' is just self depricating fun, they are into it and seem to have cool plans for the future.
p2724
aVI saw them on the 11th. They were great! Unfortunately I expended most of my energy during TrollfesT's set... Two fantastic bands, it was nice to see them together.
p2725
aVI will be seeing them on the 8th of Dicember and i am hoping this is one of the concerts i have been waiting anxious since a long time!
p2726
aVHi, I'd like to know why you're so beautiful.\u000a
p2727
aVFor some reason I just don't like alestorm. 
p2728
aVGo see them live, and I'm pretty sure your opinion will change.  My friends who don't even like metal love Alestorm.
p2729
aVOh I don't doubt they put on a great show and it'd be a hell of a time with the dancing and drinking like most folk metal shows. But it's just something about their recordings that I don't like for some reason. 
p2730

asVI want to get my friend into metal, he likes folk music...any suggestions?
p2735
(lp2736
VAs a fellow fantasy geek and folk music fab who took a long time to appreciate any metal, steer away from Folk Metal. Its kinda different to most of what is appealing about Folk music. If you do want to try Folk Metal though, try Korpiklaani. If he's big on fantasy stuff, try things like Avantasia, Dragonland or Rhapsody of Fire. Pretty regular "armies of goodness against indominatable evil, heroes on quests" sort of power metally stuff.
p2737
aVHe ended up loving those bands!
p2738
aVAyyyyy
p2739
aVPlay him a song from korpiklaani called tuli kokko.
p2740
aVThanks a ton, I think power metal is a better place to start, and those bands seem up his alley.
p2741
aVThe Varangian Way by Turisas straddles the line between power metal and folk, and is also a 10 out of 10 album, you could try that.
p2742
aVMaybe Heidevolk? It's got smooth vocals and good folksie quality. \u000a\u000aAnd as a big fantasy nerd, I'd recommend Nightwish for sure (older Tarja stuff to start with, but the newer stuff too - Imaginarium is pretty poppy). \u000a\u000a
p2743
aVEluveitie's Arcane Dominion I album. Its acoustic but its a good introduction to some of their stuff. At least it's how I started .
p2744
aVMaybe folky power metal, like Lyriel?   I personally go for Haggard, but a lot of folk-metal bands have a lot of growling, and that might put off someone coming in new.  
p2745
aVEnsiferum! Viking, very melodic.
p2746
aVThe Varanigian Way album by Turisas 
p2747
aVSkyclad, Mago de Oz, Tuatha de Danann, etc. \u000a\u000aBands that incorporate a bit more folk than all the other suggestions you're going to get here.
p2748
aVSorry I'm so late to the party. If your friend is looking for something without heavy vocals I would first suggest the albums Turisas2013 (not their best imo but there's not much heavy vocals) and Stand Up and Fight by Turisas. Also I would suggest the songs Wanderer, Lady in Black (Uriah Heep cover), Lai Lai Hei by Ensiferum and the song One More by Turisas. If he likes those songs maybe the heavier songs by Ensiferum and Turisas will grow on him. \u000a\u000aIt wouldn't be a bad idea to show him some Týr as well. 
p2749
aVI was introduced to it with Eluveitie's "Slania's Song." It has a really heavy folk feel with metal that's not overpowering. And, the fact that it's in Gaulish should satisfy his nerdy side.
p2750
aVhttp://folkmetalradio.playtheradio.com/ - show him this radio.\u000a\u000aThey just play various kinds of folk metal, from different sides of this genre, tell him to make notes of bands that he like. Thats it.\u000a\u000aAlso: Eluveitie is my bet ;)
p2751
aVYeah I played him Call of the Mountain ('cause clean vocals) he liked it!
p2752
aVI want to say Troll Gnet El but I don't know if it's heavy enough. They certainly have got the folk elements and are damn good, even if they do sing in Russian. :)
p2753
aVTriddana! Classic metal, bagpipes, flute and a singer that's basically RJ Dio v2.0
p2754
aVI really want to recommend Moonsorrow, but they've moved over to the black side of the spectrum, and it might be too hard for a guy getting his feet wet.  I think that [Raunioilla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtEIb6sX6Xs) would be a good jumping off point.

p2801
(lp2802
VThe best are subjective and I'll leave it at saying I disagree with a few choices they made. I will say fuck them though for spreading that across 5 pages, these are the times I feel less bad about using Adblock because it denies those extra page views they're apparently so damn desperate for. I really dislike that tactic.
p2803
aVNot sure how some of those bands would be considered folk metal. Also, where is Equilibrium?
p2804
aVNot a very good list. Also, how is Wintersun folk metal? I don't think being Finnish is enough to qualify.
p2805
aV&gt; Also, how is Wintersun folk metal?\u000a\u000aI think they are, but barely. Not in the more common sense though, they use some Japanese (I hope anyways, I know it's Asian but not sure which specific flavor) folk melodies in Time I. Something tells me this isn't what the people who made that list are referencing though.\u000a\u000a
p2806
aVDamn, what about Týr, Equilibrium, Heidevolk, Moonsorrow, or Arkona? I know all of them can't fit and there are definitely way more honorable mentions, but dump Blackguard, Wintersun, and maybe Agalloch (and fuck Alestorm, but that's just me not liking them haha).
p2807
aVAgalloch is more Post Black Metal than Folk Metal, and Wintersun is Epic Melodic Metal.  This list doesn't make much sense.  Eluveitie is worthy of a better spot, and just like the other guy said, Equilibrium definitely deserves a spot up there.  They need to replace the non-folk metal bands with bands like Arkona and Fejd.
p2808
aVWhat the fuck? They put Ulver and Wintersun on that list? They're barely even folk metal. I cannot agree with any top X folk metal bands list that doesn't have Moonsorrow.
p2809
aVI can't stand behind any list of best folk metal band's that doesn't have Skyclad on it.

p2827
aVAntumnos, which is mentioned in almost every Eluveitie song ever, was the Celtic people's idea of the afterlife\u2014similar to the Christian heaven.\u000a\u000aApparently the proper name, or more common name, of it is [Annwn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annwn).

aVThere's a lot of folk melodies in Eluveitie's stuff. This summer I saw a band of street musicians performing and a lot of their tunes sounded familiar until at one point I recognized "Inis Mona". Turns out one of them is a big fan of Eluveitie, they did a cover of that song and the rest was just some old songs, the same which Eluveitie craft into their music. Folk metal is awesome.

This song is one with one.\u000a\u000aSaltatio Mortis in some of their songs but I can't one with it. it disappears a bit under the bag pipes usually.\u000a\u000a[In Extremo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaS9kDZddfQ). Not all songs but I would say ~30% atleast.\u000a\u000a[Subway to Sally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykNo8ithVJ4) \u000a\u000aAnd ofcourse there is [Schandmaul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3BsXKcqF3g)

p2968
aVCool. I'll try some of their other stuff

aVYou might like Trollband. They have a somewhat blackened folk style.\u000aBandcamp: https://trollband.bandcamp.com\u000a\u000aIfing leans somewhat toward atmospheric black, but still is great for folk metal.\u000aBandcamp: https://ifing.bandcamp.com\u000a\u000aYmyrgar is not too bad either.\u000aBandcamp: https://ymyrgar.bandcamp.com/\u000a\u000aEDIT: By the way, I love the Elder Scrolls reference in the username.

aVTrollband and Ymyrgar sound pretty good. Ifing sounds even better, I have actually been listening to more atmospheric stuff lately.\u000a\u000aAnd thanks about the username.

aVFaun is a group that is more folk, not metal. Really great music though, I love them.\u000a\u000aThe sub-genre for the type of music that Faun, Subway To Sally, etc. is mitteralter. "medieval" \u000a\u000aI can't spell.

p3088
aVI'm sorry. I really wanted to like this. I love folk. I play banjo. I play mandolin. I love metal. I love folk metal. This is awful. It's unfortunate too because they are clearly talented musicians. The acoustic parts are great, but they married it with the worst parts of metal. Breakdowns and half assed screamo singing vocals. Damn it. I hate that I hate it. \u000a\u000aIt's a terrible name too. It makes it a gimmick which sucks because the songs clearly have the time put into it. Why spend all the time writing songs and then make yourself a joke with that name and those song titles. Bummersville dudes.
p3089
aVno need to apologize! this is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, especially people who love "metal" metal. and to be honest, the whole thing started as a joke (the band name came first) and the project was always rather tongue-in-cheek (a guy killing people with banjos? really?)  we never took ourselves too seriously, but we tried our best to produce something well-executed and polished...

aVyou certainly accomplished the well-executed and polished. very clean and well constructed. I suppose I was hoping for more of a crust metal sound during the metal parts. Bleak and meaner, minor and downtuned. Like if Blackbird Raum had a baby with Requiem's Storm Heaven.\u000a\u000aKeep playing banjo. Solid picking.

p3130
aVI love Dalriada, but honestly, Laura Binder isn't all that impressive. I think their guitarrist (András Ficzek) is a better vocalist than her
p3131
aVArkona have some songs with clean vocals only, like Stenka na Stenku, Kupala I Kostrama, Slavsia Rus, Zimushka, Vyidu ya na volushky, Rus'... most other songs have both clean and harsh vocals.\u000a\u000aAlso, try Grai, Týr, Metsatöll, Avven and Skiltron.

aV'Tears' by Ensiferum might be worth a visit

sVDid anyone go to the Wintersun show last night in SF?
p3145
(lp3146
VPretty sure it was their mixing, also your position in the room also had a huge effect on what you heard.
p3147
aVI was upstairs on the left balcony most of the night.. didnt realize position made that big of a difference. It sound fine to you?
p3148
aVI was downstairs, front center and I thought it sounded fine. The vocals and guitars were definitely audible.
p3149
aVnice. usually front center for me sucks. the venues I've been to have the two speakers hanging overhead on the left and right. sound just goes right over and off to the sides. worth it though, I've heard the songs before. I like being up close. Especially Wintersun! I'm going next week.\u000a\u000a
p3150
aVProtip: The best place to listen to a show is right in front of the mixing booth. The best place to *see* a show is at the back edge of the pit. You may have to deflect the occasional mosher though.
p3151
aVHeh good points 
p3152
aVDNA lounge is hit or miss for me. I've been there a few times, but that was years ago. I'm in Seattle. 
p3153
aVWintersun sounded awful last year in Oakland too IMO. This is becoming a trend.\u000a\u000aSkipped the show this time around (was in LA seeing my buddies in Nekrogoblikon) and DNA is, as usual, hit or miss. Some bands have sounded great there recently (Metsatoll comes to mind) but others have had poor mixing and have been way too loud for no reason, making everything sound muddy.
p3154
aVThe sound mix seemed basically fine to me while on the various edges of the pit (and while in the pit, but it has to be really awful to be noticeable then...).\u000a\u000aWere you wearing ear plugs?  They don't block everything equally and my experience with DNA Lounge is that the sound is usually mixed to sound good for people with ear plugs, which results in it sounding like shit (and being way too loud) for people without. Never been on the balcony for a performance, though.

p3159
aVLol, no problem. "Riding a mastodon on a week day" gave it away instantly.

aVInsomnium? I don't know what you're talking about.  Ephemeral is a fantastic EP.
p3268
aVI was already disappointed with One For Sorrow when they adopted prominent use of clean vocals, that quite frankly weren't good and were not necessary. \u000a\u000aAnd with their more recent music in general, the lyrics are far less interesting but are now simplistic and more soppy, nowhere near as poetic and deep as in their old music. The melodies too aren't anywhere near as refined and beautiful as they used to be and simply the clean vocals do not add anything but cheapen the music.

p3284
aVHey, I actually know a few songs from Vintersorg! I should start listening to them more. Thanks for these!
p3285
aVYeah the Vintersorg vocalist is also the vocalist for Otyg and Borknagar so check them out too.\u000a\u000aMake sure you hit up the first two albums from Vintersorg before you do anything else and then listen to the rest. The entire discography is good but the first two are the best IMO.\u000a\u000aHere have some more while your at it:\u000a\u000a[Wodensthrone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llFT6GyOA98)\u000a\u000a[Ulver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9EaZNhZ-Ro)\u000a\u000a[Winterfylleth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0Hi6g98JXg)\u000a\u000a[Old Corpse Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveRW3nj3Ko)\u000a\u000a[Jaldaboath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrHinL1kEZ0)\u000a\u000a[Dalriada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv84v_NwEs4)\u000a\u000aAnd just in case there is a chance you don't know, Bathory did some kind of folky stuff too!\u000a\u000a[Bathory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRdVgPAe450)
p3286
aVI listened to Bathory a few years back, and I know a few songs by Old Corpse Road, but other than that, I've got a buttload of folk metal to listening to do.
p3287
aVVintersorg is really good. I dont agree with all of the bands in that list, but most are at least worth knowing if not listening to regularly.
p3288
aVNow I know I'm officially far too deep down in the Folk metal pit when I know and love most of the "obscure" bands...\u000a\u000aSummoning is probably one of my favourite bands of all time.  I'd also check out [Caladan Brood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py6iHvKbDjs) if you enjoy Summoning.
p3289
aVCame here to mention Otyg and Forefather! Great bands. I've not listened to Otyg in a few years but if memory serves they can be weird. A good way to get a sense of them is to check out their cover of Holy Diver. \u000a\u000aAlso Waylander is a little more obscure I would say. 
p3290
aVWe should compile a list of bands like this, putting yours and /u/HandsomeDynamite's lists together and adding more.  Both of you included great bands, but you both left out Skalmold, Dalriada, Irminsul, and Heri Joensen's Heljareyga.
p3291
aVI put Dalriada in as an afterthought, I don't really like their sound so I left them out at first.
p3292
aVYeah most lists will include what the lister enjoys.  That's why it's important to have multiple people creating lists.
p3293
aVCan I play devil's advocate and bother you for a few suggestions that ARE more melodeath? 
p3294
aVYeah I may be off with a few of them though because I'm not so well up on them:\u000a\u000a[Northland - Old Town's Inn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QVAE9mksZU)\u000a\u000a[Aether Realm - Raven Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRrT3Bgw_AM)\u000a\u000a[Whispered - Jikininki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuDKqaqdhH8)\u000a\u000a[Svartby - Mushroom Rings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTsCgIkQoV0)\u000a\u000a
p3295
aVWell I dunno how obscure these really are but I certainly hear them brought up less than the bands you mentioned. \u000a\u000a[Wolfchant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvU-iuN9OOQ)\u000a\u000a[Falkenbach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoTy6K8xzzs)\u000a\u000a[Runic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AC_HHQGzHY)\u000a\u000a[Metsatoll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--i3pwGGabE)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVFavorite folk metal song of all time - [Magog (Swe) - Favourable Winds Blow Us Far Towards an End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM-PfykQqc4)
p3303
aVI love Magog references, and all Magog (a.k.a. Evangeli) is infinitely brilliant.  Years ago I purchased each demo directly from the band.  It is downright criminal that they were never able to secure a album deal, yet so much other bland and/or talentless garbage does.
p3304
aVFferyllt are amazing, and I definitely agree with Falkenbach and Cruachan!
p3305
aVits not truly metal, but Faun is my favorite medieval folk rock band that doesnt seem to be as popular in the movement as I think they should be. Also Tengger Cavalry is fucking awesome. Not the most obscure but not exactly korpiklaani either.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also I would call them more mainstream but if you havent listened to Heidevolk yet you should.\u000a\u000aEDIT 2: And Schandmaul.
p3306
aVFans of [Tengger Cavalry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv_aEwVvak) from Mongolia should definitely take a look at [Nine Treasures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e1JyWgVfnI), also a Folk band from that region.\u000a\u000a[Shangren Dynasty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAvWPvse4ac) from Australia.

aVMy favorite is Hardingrock.  It's a project of Ihsahn, so I don't know how obscure that makes it, but it is way more mature sounding (ie less silly) than most of the folk metal I've heard.  And it features the premiere hardinger fiddle player in Norway.   Hardingrock-Fanitullen: http://youtu.be/mmBdofWuEg8

[Árstíðir lífsins](http://youtu.be/haJBBg8X7KQ) is great for fans of black metal, but their folk parts are really what makes them great.

p3370
aVSexy. Fuckin' Sexy
p3371
aVYes! I've seen the Italian version in Treviso and the Swiss one in Prague two days ago. They let the audience decide on whether they want the English or a different version, and apparently so far they never got to play the English one on the European tour :D I don't know what it is, but that song really got me, especially in Schwitzerdütsch... they should do more songs in that language. 
p3372
aVI really enjoyed and still do rock out to this album. Definitely on par with their quality of music. Especially considering how good Helvetios was. From Darkness is my personal favorite on the album but there weren't any songs I disliked which is best case scenario for an album. I just wish their would been one more track with female vocals and harsh vocals backing. Such an amazing mix I.e. Alessia \u000aEnsiferum has a new ablum coming out too early next year.

p3379
aVI really can't get into their music... I feel like their style is pretty stagnant in that their music is pretty predictable.\u000a\u000aAs I've said many times, they are basically a band I *should* theoretically like but don't.   \u000a\u000aI know this subreddit loves them, but they really do nothing for me.  
p3380
aVYesterday I didn't even know Folk Metal existed, today it's my favorite genre of music thanks to this album.
p3381
aVWelcome! \u005cm/ Eluveitie was my first introduction into folk metal (and a gateway to most other metal as well), though I started with Evocation.
p3382
aVFan-fucking-tastic.  Only downside for me was a too many spoken word tracks/sections.  Still, definitely the best album of 2014.
p3383
aVI'm honestly surprised at how much I enjoyed (am still enjoying) it. I'm not the biggest Eluveitie fan, but 'Helvetios' is probably one of my top 5 albums *ever*. Across all genres.\u000a\u000aThis album is a hell of a follow-up to what I consider an almost perfect album.
p3384
aVI think it's their best overall album. Helvetios had stronger standout songs--I'd even accept that Slania did too, but their sound has matured a lot since then--but nothing else they've put out has stayed so consistently good from beginning to end. I've listened to it regularly since it came out.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFrom Darkness, Virinus, and Call of the Mountains are the best tracks.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p3385
aVNot to be a bummer, but it is my least favorite album by them. I love listening to individual songs by them shuffled with other artists. When I saw them live this year it was the most disappointing concert I have been to. They performed exceptionally, but track after track from Origins made it quite repetitive. Overall I'd say its an alright album, but their techniques they use in their metal songs are too repetitive.\u000a\u000aTL;DR Alright album that is pretty much the same as their others.  
p3386
aVIs it metal or acoustic? Because these days I only ever really listen to Ven or Evocation. There metal stuff is getting too practiced and formulaic. Fantastic as a gateway band to folk metal from those who like general paint-by-numbers metal but I just can't get enthused about it. Every album is more of the same but with less spirit and originality each time.
p3387
aVNo idea why you're getting down voted... I personally think your opinion is spot on.  \u000a\u000aAs I've already posted, I find their music predictable and their ideas far too similar to many of their other songs.  \u000a\u000aI kind of hoped that a small sub reddit like this was beyond downvoting opinions when they said something critical about a band they liked...
p3388
aVI hoped so too, but whatever. Everybody was so all over this I thought it was worth posting an opposing view to provide some contrast. I used to be all over Eluveitie too, I preordered the Slania LP and wore the hoodie to bits (holes in the elbows... takes some doing) But slowly I just kept going back to the quiet stuff and if I wanted a blast of angry then Ven fills the spot without going on for too long.\u000a\u000a\u000aI'm just waiting for Evocation 2. When that happens I will be camping outside the record stores door to grab a copy.
p3389
aVI see what you're saying, but you don't have to be such a dick about it.

aVLoved it. One of my favourite albums of all time
p3392
aVI've listened to it in its entirety multiple times.  Can't get enough of it.  It's possibly my favorite album by them, second only to Evocation I - The Arcane Dominion.  Just a great album, no complaints.

VLet's see what I can remember... I'll start with folk albums from metal bands.\u000a\u000aArkona released a compilation of their acoustic folk songs for free online, called Akustika. Drudkh has "Songs of Grief and Solitude," but it is mainly the folk melodies from their metal songs, taken and made into folk songs. Ulver has that one folk album, Kveldssanger. \u000a\u000aSvarga has a folk album- [Krov'-Reka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSVYNZiWaYM), a live acoustic album- Vetry proschayut vsyo, and a few collaboration folk singles.

aVWooo, another excuse to shill for my sub!

p3634
aVI think Equilibrium has a very unique sound, but I can give you some more bands with German lyrics and similar epicness: [Gernotshagen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqPfRU7HnwA), [Abinchova](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1xFc73-CB8), [Bifröst](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OSg_yRK6rQ), [Finsterforst](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1e5z1gagZY), [Ahnengrab](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLJ19qm9utY), [Wolfchant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2T7ym4RljI)
p3635
aVClosest I would say is either Falkenbach or Suidakra. Some of the early Moonsorrow also shares a similar sound, but for the most part Equilibirum is a unique band
p3636
aVNot with German lyrics but similiar style: [Moonsorrow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwN8QRpAP3k)
p3637
aVMoonsorrow is definitely darker and less uplifting, but it's still a fantastic recommendation. \u000a\u000a
p3638
aVNot by a lot but I always thought they brought out the same joyful folk feelings as [Arkona](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt6_65LDZ60).  The music itself is quite different but you might like them.
p3639
aVIve been looking for the same exact sort of thing. No other bands have their sound. It can really only be described as epic. 
p3640
aVThe old singer joined a band called Arafel, I think.
p3641
aV[Finsterforst](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZc1RsVz0yU) are the band that I think sound most like Equilibrium.  The song I linked to probably is more like Moonsorrow, but many of there other songs have that overly-happy feel and cheery accordian melodies.  \u000a\u000aIt's also in German if that's what you're after!

(lp3703
VYou were correct with Eluveitie though! The second part of the song you posted is [Morrison's Jig](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8U0GCtcgzM) which you can find in Eluveitie's [Tegernako](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20SsyQjxc74)!  \u000a\u000aEDIT: 5:13 in Tegernako, that's where it is.
p3704
aVIt seems like something Ensiferum or Nightwish would do, in my opinion. As /u/agersant said, [Over The Hills And Far Away by Nightwish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR8I7nL9WOU) uses a riff that is very similar to this. 
p3705
aVI prefer Thyrfing's version, but that's just me.\u000a\u000ahttp://youtu.be/8sAGze3RaRY
p3706
aVMany of the riffs in Eluveitie's music and other folk bands borrow heavily from Irish and other traditional music. In fact, when I saw Eluveitie play live at Hellfest 2011 (Metal festival in France) they kind of apologized to the crowd before playing Inis Mona because it's such a blatant rip-off of "Tri Martolod", a classic Brittany tune (the french region, not Britain).\u000aMy Irish friend who plays Trad can name several of the other songs they use for their material.\u000a\u000aDon't worry, they aren't the only ones who do it and it's [not limited](http://youtu.be/JdxkVQy7QLM) to Folk metal either.\u000a\u000aFun fact, the french region of Brittany is one of 5 officially recognized Celtic heritage regions.

Vraised up as a reformed protestant, the chorus of this one always brings me in a "Christmas" spirit. it resembles so much to the psalms, but I honestly think it's because of the way they covered the chorus from the kvæði. \u000a
p3820
aVGrind is usually killed during summer though.
p3821
aVwell, it's not a bad one, though I was really appalled when I heard that they got signed by Metal Blade Records, fearing that their sound would change totally in a more "hey, I sound like all the other "folk" metal bands out there"...but that's life, they have to make money somehow.
p3822
aVThe first time I listened through the album, this one didn't stand out at all.  Going back, I find that this is one of the few that really preserves the style and feeling of Tyr from albums like Land and Eric the Red.  If only the song were about 2 minutes longer it would probably be my favorite on Valkyrja.
p3823
aVSo I'm fairly new to the genre (heard Finntroll about a year ago). Tyr was one of the those bands that I never got around to listening to despite the endless recommendations. This was the first album I heard in full, I had heard Hold the Heathen Hammer High awhile back though. Now that I've made it through the whole discography, I get why people arent too into the newer stuff. Since the album was really the first I heard from them I absolutely love it. Another Fallen Brother is a kick ass song from that album.\u000a\u000aDo you have any favorites from the old albums?\u000a
p3824
aVAll of my favorite songs are from their old albums!  Not just favorite Tyr songs, favorite songs.  There's Dreams and Regin Smidur, Ride to Hel and Wings of Time, Sinklars Visa and Lokka Tattur, to name a few of the best.  Their style really shifted over the albums.  The first one, How Far To Asgaard, sounds like proggy doom metal with traditional influences, and has a different singer.\u000a\u000aMy favorite is Eric the Red, some more good ones from that are Ramund Hin Unge and The Edge.  Ragnarok is a more progressive concept album, and Land is more focused on their Faroese roots.  By the Light of the Northern Star is where they start getting less progressive but in my mind is still an excellent album.  It has everything Lay of Thrym and Valkyrja have, without the power metal that gets in the way.\u000a\u000aI still like new Tyr too, just not as much.  Another Fallen Brother and lady of the Slain are some of the best songs they've made in years.
p3825
aVI feel like I could've written this exact post.
p3826
aVIt does feel like a popular opinion.
p3827
aVThanks. I'll start digging deeper into the old stuff. I have to say though... I fucking love power metal, so that's probably why I like the newer stuff a lot.
p3828
aVLol yeah, it's just a matter of taste.  My friend loves power metal and Valkyrja is his favorite Tyr.  I like power metal too, so I would love Valkyrja if I didn't expect it to be more like Ragnarok.  I think that's how most people in folk metal feel.
p3829
aVI'm listening to Eric the Red right now. It's so proggy, I love it.

They're an Israeli band who also fuses black metal with middle-eastern folk instrumentation very well.\u000a\u000aAlso, though they're more staight death metal, [Lykathea Aflame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF6AazbybME) is a band that has some strong middle-eastern style melodies as well.
p3871
aVI was wandering around youtube today and stumbled across a band called Seeds of Iblis who is apparently part of an "Arabic Anti-Islamic Legion" or some such thing involving 3 or 4 other black metal bands.  Most of it seemed even less listenable than this though, both re: arrangements and re: recording quality (I know it is not "cool" to complain about recording quality with black metal, but still).  Too bad because I would LOVE to find a black metal band who carries on about Iblis the same way the European guys carry on about Satan - sadly my tastes are more toward the symphonic end than the lo-fi end and I haven't found anything that really grips me yet on that front.\u000a\u000aWay less heavy than all of the above, there's also [Orphaned Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG213nX6cto).  I find them a lot more interesting to listen to than the more black-metal-leaning stuff from the region that I've encountered so far... Melechesh being a prime exception, i.e. I agree with the other poster on that front re: they're very good.
p3872
aVIt starts off good, progresses a bit unexpectedly, but I'm still jammin.. Them it transitioned to the vocals, and well, I wasn't on board after that. Other than that, they have potential. Instead of building up to generic metal, they should build up to better desert metal. 
p3873
aVI wonder how they get around their extremely restrictive government. With a name that apparently means "Non-Believer", I can only imagine they have the tread lightly.
p3874
aVSorry for the necro, I was just looking around for more info on this band. Anyway, Al-Namrood doesn't necessarily equate "non-believer", it's basically Nimrod in Arabic which I suppose is open to interpretation as to how it's meant as a name.\u000a\u000aTheir record company however, is called "Shaytan Productions" literally meaning Satan's production. That's a name they wouldn't get away with in Saudi-Arabia.

I know that's more than 3, but it is the only band I mentioned.  Their sound is quite varied, so even now, I feel like I didn't give them the proper representation.  I don't understand why they're not all over reddit. If I were going to obliterate a planet, I would definitely use Sumerian Daemons as the soundtrack.  In the meantime, it served as the soundtrack while I folded the laundry, today...

aVAww man. I loved unsung heroes. Honestly the first listen I was quick to judge and wasn't too impressed but after I was able to give it a few good listen throughs I really enjoyed almost every song. Minus celestial bond.

aVThat Amon Amarth cover was badass though, I think I've heard other songs from that same band.\u000a\u000aMy top 5 is 1.Eluveitie 2. Blind Guardian (Probably actually tied for #1) 3. Wolfchant 4. Waylander 5. Suidakra
p3973
aVNice. I'm always, always looking for good new metal and I've heard of all those bands (I really like Suidakra, even walked out to Darkane Times for an mma fight once) but can you send me you're favorite song form 2,3 and 4? Thanks man.

p3975
aVAnd here's a few lesser known folk metal bands I really like if you want something new:\u000a\u000aAdorned Brood- Pagan Knights\u000a\u000aCraving- Targaryen Wrath (They're not exactly folk metal, but close enough that most folk metal fans will like it.)\u000a\u000aFrosttide- Siege\u000a\u000aHammer Horde- In the Name of Winter's Wrath\u000a\u000aMael Mordha- Dawning of the Grey\u000a\u000aNightcreepers- A Tale of Haste\u000a\u000aSkadika- The Hero Way\u000a\u000aWolfheart- Ghosts of Karelia (death metal but they're a recent discovery I'm REALLY starting to love)\u000a
p3976
aVI am a huge Amon Amarth fan and I've listened to every Ensiferum album at pretty every level of stoned, I just really can't get into Unsung Heroes. Believe me, I tried, they're one of my favorite bands of all time. If it was from a different band I'd probably like it more, but after the masterpiece they put out with From Afar I just couldn't appreciate Unsung Heroes.
p3977
aVAm I the only one who thinks Victory Songs was the last truly epic Ensiferum album. From Afar was good (I absolutely loved Twilight Tavern), but it felt somewhat repetitive.
p3978
aVWanderer from victory songs is amazing! And from afar had heather throne then the longest journey. So long. So epic. Best way to spend 20+ minutes if listened to in a row. And yes twilight tavern is a masterpiece. 
p3979
aVI loved Victory Songs, but I really consider From Afar their best. They really didn't put out anything I didn't love the shit out of until Unsung Heroes.
p3980
aVI wasn't too keen on the first few songs they released as teasers but after purchasing today and giving it a full listen, this album is definitely good. There are some real gems. I also look forward to seeing them this Autumn (along with Týr!)
p3981
aVReally love the album. I posted 2 lyric videos for The Nameless and From Darkness but Nuclear Blast took them down for copyright! I didn't really have any malicious intentions but I sent a PM and email to Nuclear Blast. Hopefully they respond soon and let me post them. I didn't think there would be problems as everyone posts lyric videos :( Does anyone know more about this situation?

aVNapalm has out a "sampler" of each track. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQduhe36HeM)\u000a\u000aOne thing Masha said about the album is that it is more "serious" so there are no songs like Stenka na Stenku or Yarilo on it. No "fun" songs. It is about the separation from the material world. Being Siberian &amp; then being from Moscow I get what they mean.
p3991
aVI would agree with her assessment of the album.. I'm just curious how actual fans will find it.  I'm going to reserve judgment and listen to it a few more times.  Its definitely a departure though.
p3992
aVIt has something of a progressive bend that caught me off guard. I've listened to it 5 times by now and will still need a few spins to let it sink in. 
p3993
aVBeen listening to it non-stop since I got it and already had the chance to see new songs live a few times. Especially Yav' and Na Strazhe Novyh Let are incredibly powerful live songs! About the album - I love it's complexity. Every time I listen to a song, I discover new sound elements and structures. It might be difficult for fans of, say, Goi Rode Goi or Vo Slavu Velikim to get into it because of the many progressive parts and lack of folk elements, but I think the change of sound was an important step - and I know it wasn't easy for them. \u000aImo Masha's songwriting grew and developed further with every release. Each song has it's very own character but they perfectly fit together on one album (that's what I missed a little on Slovo). This makes Yav almost a concept album and it's message is a very important one - so it's good they published English translations of the songs. I've always been a fan of their "darker" or more serious songs, so I really don't miss the "fun" ones.

asVPaganfest USA 2014 Bands Announced

VI am interested, I do want to see Turisas,and Chthonic. 
p4012
aVI saw Paganfest last year for Ensiferum, and I'm excited this year for Korpiklaani and Turisas. Can't wait for the Denver stop.
p4013
aVI will hopefully be seeing it Denver as well\u000a
p4014
aVSee you there! Can't wait for the mosh pit.
p4015
aVDoes anyone know why there's no European paganfest tour this year?
p4016
aVHeidenfest just happened a few months ago and Festival season is in June. It looks like it might not happen this spring.
p4017
aVFucking no rasputin at the turisas show in tilburg. Nobody understood, everybody screamed for rasputin...
p4018
aVAwwwww, this is disappointing. I can't say I'm interested in seeing any of these bands this year. \u000a\u000aChthonic could be interesting, and I've never seen them, but I think this is the first year that I'll be skipping this show.
p4019
aVAfter last year's paganfest it's definitely a disappointment, but I think it will still be a really fun show. Turisas and Korpiklaani are both amazing at putting on a fun, entertaining show. \u000a\u000aIf I didn't have to travel to go see it I would still go. 
p4020
aV2008 was the last time I saw Turisas that I really enjoyed it. I feel like they've been mailing it in ever since and have literally gone from one of my favorite live bands to being an automatic skip.\u000a\u000aKorpiklaani can be fun, but -- again -- they tour so frequently and play every festival that it's not a must-see for me anymore.
p4021
aVDamn that's a mega bummer - 2008 was also the last time I saw Turisas and I was super pumped to see them again.
p4022
aVI think people underestimate how perfect Hanu and Netta were for this band (haven't seen them without Tude). I saw them twice in 2012 post-Hanu/Netta leaving the band and it's just. . .not the same.\u000a\u000aDoesn't help that they've released two underwhelming albums and their setlists are, of course, going to be based around those two (and 'Battle Metal', 'Rasputin', maybe 'One More'. . .). No thanks.
p4023
aVTHEY DID NOT PLAY RASPUTIN at heidenfest 2013 in Tilburg,(netherlands) 
p4024
aVI've never seen Chthonic live, and I'm not sure if they really fit into folk, but they do some pretty great melodeath (and black in the older stuff) and use some traditional instruments like the ehru. Their performance at Taiwans Golden Music awards was pretty good ([Defenders of Bu'tik palace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZRgih2Lr_U&amp;list=PLwquGFDLGAoWboug2b56n8qwRDBUBbO2p)). There's also a lot of thought behind their songs - Takao, Broken Jade, Supreme Pain for the Tyrant and such all have videos explaining the themes behind them. Hoping they come the the UK some time this year, and I'm also desperate for Eluveitie to come here some time soon.
p4025
aVExcited for Koorpilanni and Chthonic. I haven't listened to Varg or Winterhymn, but I don't really like Turisas. Seems like an ok year. Still doesn't beat Part III
p4026
aVOne year they'll bring those bands that rarely or never come to the US... I'll skip this.
p4027
aVI've seen Korp twice, Turisas and Winterhymn once but loved their show. Plus I like these two new bands I've not seen. I'm espically excited with Chthonic because I'm really enjoying the new taste of Asian and Middle Eastern folk metal.\u000a\u000aForgive my ignorance so please fans of both bands if you've heard it before don't be mad but... Turisas and Varg kinda look the same?
p4028
aVThat was the first thing I noticed when I saw Varg open for Eluveitie in 2012, same style of facepaint. It'll be fun to see both at the same show.
p4029
aVI wish I could still be excited to see Turisas. They got real shitty real fast.\u000a\u000aHopefully Eluveitie will come around soon

p4047
aVFor me, it would have to go to TrollfesT's [TrinkenTroll](http://youtu.be/7VRw58QeGr8?t=45s). This song's mood changes throughout (fast thrashy beats to smooth acoustic) almost as if it had a split personality.

asVTurisas - Take The Day!
p4066
(lp4067
VAwesome band, love it. It's a shame the last album switched to a more rock vibe and seemed overall unfinished and experimental, they could have achieved more by sticking with their badass viking roots.
p4068
aVThe problem is that people want to pigeonhole certain bands into a specific genre and when that doesn't happen they complain that they are not the same band.  Turisas2013 is amazing, despite a stupid album title.  Some songs sound like they could be on earlier albums while some songs strive to be different.  My personal favorite is "We Ride Together"  \u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeeCUmcHKYw 
p4069
aVI personally think it just generally sucks. Just not the kind of music I want to hear. I mean if they like it whatever but I'll keep listening to their old stuff. 
p4070
aVThe varangian way is still their best so far, every track is excellent on it. Stand up and fight had some great tracks but Turisas2013 had very few. Only Greek Fire and Piece by Piece IMO were good.
p4071
aVMan, I love the Turisas so much. I have to listen to at least one track on Stand Up and Fight a day. \u000a\u000aI've seen many comments like yours since their latest came out, and it has made me extremely apprehensive in regards to listening it. Is it really THAT me. \u000a\u000aEDIT:  A day. 
p4072
aVI really enjoyed it. People seem to be turned off to it because it's a little less heavy and doesn't take itself seriously at all compared to their last album. They were just having fun and it shows. \u000a\u000aDefinitely different from their older stuff, but I have no complaints with a band trying something a bit new.
p4073
aVIt's not that it's awful, but to me there is a right time and place for everything. Coming from a band where the viking theme is central to some of their best songs the Turisas2013 album just seems underwhelming. \u000a\u000aI suppose my main problem with it is that they don't choose a clear direction. If they want to take their viking roots to a higher level this album fails to do so on all account. If on the other side this is an experimental attempt to get over the swords and face paint viking image (which is something I can totally respect) it still comes short because it lacks any unifying structure. Certain songs can equally well be labelled as power, symphonic or death metal, while others are (in my opinion fairly weak) rock songs. There is no theme, no structure, nothing that ties the album together and solidifies it as the next big step in Turisas metal music. \u000a\u000aDon't get me wrong, I can appreciate some of the songs in their own right, maybe even as an album in it's own right, but listening to it there's just very little of what made Turisas "Turisas" for me. But mostly I'm really curious where they will take any future albums. I think both a rebirth of the viking stuff or a better refinement of these new directions could work, it's all up to them. 
p4074
aVThanks for articulating this position so well. Usually when I see people bashing this album, they don't give very good reasons. Can totally respect and see where you're coming from. Still, I really enjoyed the album as a whole.

p4106

aVI'm probably one of the only folk metal fans that just doesn't like this band.  The folk parts to their songs are amazing but I just don't like the metal that they play.  I already bought my ticket for their headlining tour mainly to see Tyr.  Maybe seeing them live will change my mind.
p4129
aVI went to see them live a few years ago, they just played Helvetios through in its entirety, and at the end of their encore was an extended jam of Tegernako (IMHO their best song), we had an epic circle pit around a few people who actually knew some step-dance, it was amazing.
p4130
aVTBH, i didn't like this song that much. Now, it wasn't bad, but it was like Home from Helvetios. It's the one I skip when i'm not intending to listen to the whole album.
p4131
aVAre you kidding? Home is great! I almost cried the first time I heard it.
p4132
aVTo me, it's not that interesting. It's like a wave of sound that's trying to be a ballad, but it just doesn't keep me amused for the length of the song.

That does not mean that we stopped with it forever. We simply did not have a good opportunity this year to offer you a good billing. Most of the popular bands of this genre are doing their own headliner touring, so it would not really make sense to double-book them for PAGANFEST. But there are plans for 2015 already.

asVFolk Metal Guitarists...
p4154
(lp4155
VI would say E Standard, Eb Standard or D Standard.
p4156
aV(to add to MeatloafCupcake) Like above, except it's really genre dependent so if you're interested in more powermetally, early Elvenking type folk-metal then any of the above, but if you're more into Viking metal they'll be tuned lower generally. E and D standard are the most common tunings, if you have a floating bridge switching between tunings is a hassle so either pick a tuning you personally like or get more than one guitar and keep them at different tunings.
p4157
aVAmon Amarth plays B and occasionally A, which is pretty insane.  Tyr uses 7 strings that range from a high E to B.  I don't know about any others but I assume it's in the vicinity of E or D for most bands.
p4158
aVI don't think its about a specific tuning more about the tune you get from it. you can make any kind of music with any kind of tuning if you try hard enough. when it comes to folk metal I see the guitar as less of a main instrument because I think there are different areas added in like: Pipes, Violin, Accordion etc. but thats just my opinion its still an important part tho.
p4159
aVthat does make alot of sense
p4160
aVWhat I mean is you shouldn't try to just restrict yourself to one type of tuning for playing folk metal. its more about the tunes you make than the tuning its in. just my opinion tho
p4161
aVFolk metal bands don't use downtuned guitars nearly as much as other subgenres of metal such as doom or death metal to name a few. It really just depends on the band.
p4162
aVMy band uses Drop G (7 string) and drop C (6 string) but its rare for folk metal bands to go so low.\u000a\u000aI'd say D standard would be the most common alternate tuning.
p4163
aVNothing too wild generally (either E standard, E flat, drop D, or D standard, much like you'd see in most metal) with the exception of Finntroll.  Finntroll are weird...
p4164
aVI predominantly play folk metal on guitar and I'm either in standard or a half step down. Honestly, when your weaving folk metal melodies on guitar, just play it in different keys until it sounds good.  Natural minor scales are your friend too.
p4165
aVMost of the stuff seems to be played in standard. I've heard some acoustic tracks played in an open tuning though so you could explore that a bit. /r/guitar would be a good source for some more info on that if you like.
p4166
asV"medieval rock" band Feuerschwanz. I'm not sure understanding German would help me understand the video, but I like the music.

That is exactly what it means and it is the title of another fairy tale. \u000a\u000aMore edits: The band is definitely German, but they're from SouthEastern Germany so the accent is different from what is taught in school, at least here in the US. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p4170
aVAwesome thanks for the tips! My school actually teaches Austrian German, so the accents I am used to arent German accents, still they sounded weirdly light. Maybe that is regional though as you said.
p4171
aVAnyway,  after spending 5 years in Germany, i can say,  \u000a\u000aI thought I learnded German until I crossed the bridge over the Rhein, where the people had a so different accent that I couldn't understand anymore :) \u000a\u000a(Seriously, it's not as strong as what I said, but there is still a lot of people with strong accent, when I hear people from northern Germany sounds like they are dutch, and when I hear people from Bavaria it sounds like they are illegal migrant from hungary, and I don't talk about the Swiss ) :p \u000a\u000a

aVMeh... Facebook... I guess I'll live without ever seeing it, then...

p4185
asVWho are the Big 4 of folk metal?
p4186
(lp4187
VFinntroll, Eluveitie, Korpiklaani, Ensiferum \u000a\u000aare the first that come to mind
p4188
aVHow popular exactly are Eluveitie?  They seem to have got pretty big lately.
p4189
aVThey packed the Hollywood House of Blues when I saw them last November. I'd say they're pretty big. I also see at the very least two or three Eluveitie shirts whenever I go to a folk metal concert here.
p4190
aVNah, Wintersun packed the House of Blues.  Crowd thinned out when Eluveitie went on stage. 
p4191
aVYeah, this is probably the correct answer. I guess you *might* be able to make an argument for Equilibrium, though.
p4192
aVThis is indeed a good list. Equilibrium and Moonsorrow are my favorite bands so I'd like to see them in it though. I don't know if they're popular enough to be included. Equilibrium could raise their popularity hugely by playing outside the Central Europe more. At least here in Finland it's much less known than the Finnish bands or Eluveitie for example.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I might argue that Turisas could be in that list in terms of both popularity and quality.
p4193
aVTurisas doesn't have as much folk in their sound since the first couple albums, so it's debatable. They'd be my next contender, though.
p4194
aVI'm a huge fan of Equilibrium and Turisas, but I think part of what gets Equilibrium is also their German-exclusive lyrics. Lyrics in English tend to garner a more global audience, but a lot of bands have managed to become really popular without (like Gorgoroth in Black Metal). Also, Turisas dropped some of that folk sound in their newest album since they don't have Netta Skog on accordion anymore. :(\u000a\u000aBut I'd have to say Eluveitie, Korpiklaani, and Ensiferum definitely belong there. Flinntroll is good, too, but I think that 4th spot is up for debate.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Clarified that Gorgoroth is Black Metal.
p4195
aVMine exactly, although I would break the rule and add Tyr as a different take on folk metal (as in sans folk intruments)
p4196
aVThis is a good grouping. All well-known and productive groups, but pretty diverse, too.
p4197
aVExactly what I was thinking. 
p4198
aVI was going to say the same.. 3 of those bands came to Australia this year I didn't see eluvatie due to money, and I'm not as interested in them as other bands, hoping Finntroll comes here soon! 
p4199
aVI'd exchange Ensiferum for Moonsorrow.
p4200
aVNah. Ensiferum is better known than Moonsorrow. I like both quite a lot though.
p4201
aVI think we'd also have to mention Týr; it's not specifically folk metal fans that listen to it(and apparently one of the Metallica band members likes it too).
p4202
aVAnd Rob Halford!  I would agree with bpmetal for popularity, but if we're going by authenticity than [old] Týr is the winner.
p4203
aVTýr, ensiferum, moonsorrow, korpiklaani, and finntroll. Although, I have found folk metal that I like much more than most of this stuff(except tyr. Tyrs old stuff is folk Prog gold) like finsterforst and draugnim
p4204
aV[deleted]
p4205
aVReading through all these comments made me sad. 31 comments in and no one has the absolute definitive folk metal band listed. Skyclad.\u000a\u000aIf we're talking influence alone, the Big 4 (or 5) probably looks like:\u000a\u000a* Skyclad\u000a* Primordial\u000a* Bathory\u000a* Cruachan/Mago de Oz\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen they talk about The Big 4 in thrash, it's about influence *and* popularity. I find it really, really difficult to include Eluveitie and Korpiklaani in a list of "influential" folk metal bands given how recent their "success" has been.\u000a\u000aI could probably agree the list looks something like:\u000a\u000a* Skyclad\u000a* Ensiferum\u000a* Finntroll\u000a* Primordial\u000a\u000aIt's tough for me to not include Orphaned Land (first album released in 1992) but I don't think their sphere of influence is as great as Primordial's despite the fact that I honestly rarely listen to the latter. I think most folk metal today draws most of their influence from Bathory/Primordial/Skyclad though.\u000a\u000aSometimes I feel like the only person around here who listened to folk metal before 2001.
p4206
aVI'm a bit late to the party, but I just have to agree with you. I often get angry at how Skyclad gets overlooked in these kind of discussions. That's like talking about most influential bands in metal in general and not mentioning Black Sabbath. It's ridiculous. 
p4207
aVEluveitie's Helvetica is one of the greatest folk metal albums in my opinion. A whole album devoted to the Gallic Wars and the Helvetii in particular. 
p4208
aVI would say Turisas, Eluveitie, Korpiklaani, and Ensiferum
p4209
aVI think due to sheer longevity and consistency Finntroll have to be up there, they've kept their folk sound throughout, unlike Turisas who are significantly less folk since their last couple of albums.
p4210
aVThis would be my list, too. Though it would be a tough call between Turisas and Tyr.
p4211
aVThat was my problem too. Since Tyr is less folk metal I decided to go with Turisas.
p4212
aVMoonsorrow, Týr, Korpiklaani and Eluveitie
p4213
aVEnsiferum, Korpiklaani, Turisas, Tyr.\u000a\u000aFollowed by Eluveitie, Equilibrium, Heidevolk, and Moonsorrow.
p4214
aVIf we're going for a true Big Four style (as in all from the same area, all developed around the same time) then I'd say Finntroll, Korpiklaani, Ensiferum and Turisas, as they're all Finnish and all started in roughly the same few years. Plus it includes a band who started out as folk metal but as their popularity grew they abandoned folk in favour of a more generic, saleable sound in the vein of Metallica (I'm looking at you Turisas!)  \u000a  \u000aHowever if we're going for consistent sound and sphere of influence then it has to be Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani and Eluveitie (I toyed with Tyr for a while but they've had less and less folk metal tracks on their albums in recent years, opting for more standard prog metal stuff).  \u000a  \u000aYou could also argue that Moonsorrow are the Megadeth of folk metal, as one of their members is/was also a member of another big four band (Dave Mustaine is to Metallica as Henri Sorvali is to Finntroll)
p4215
aV/u/bpmetal has it right in term of popularity.  Personally, I would say Týr, Ensiferum, Moonsorrow, Arkona.  My favorites.\u000a\u000aI might pick Dalriada, Skalmold, Heljareyga, and Irminsul as an alt 'Smaller Big 4'.
p4216
aVI'd switch Moonsorrow for Equilibrium and Ensiferum for Turisas. But I support your choice of Arkona. I think Big 4 of folk metal should represent folk music from different countries.
p4217
aVI would like to argue Turisas as well, as they were one of the three bands that got me into folk metal (along with Korpiklaani and Ensiferum,) but the fact of the matter is that recently they've gone for a more prog/power metal sound with these last two albums, which constitutes approximately half of their discography.
p4218
aVIt was a hard decision between Korpiklaani and Turisas for me as well. You are right about them gone more power/prog, so considering Turisas' last album, Korpiklaani could fit in the Big 4 of folk metal instead of Turisas.
p4219
aV"Smaller Big 4" is right.  I mean as it is, Folk Metal is a massively niche genre and within that genre, there are even more obscure, less well known bands.  I'm a massive folk metal fan and out of your "Small Big 4" I only knew two.  \u000a\u000aOf course I know of all the others people posted.  "Big 4" doesn't necessarily relate to music quality but to popularity and general recognition.  \u000a\u000aAs much as I love Eluveitie, I believe Moonsorrow has far grander, truly epic songs that are far more varying in their sound and composition, however they are less well known.  Moonsorrow are probably one of the best folk metal bands as they display true mastery of the art.  \u000a\u000aOut of the bands posted I believe Equilibrium, Eluveitie and Korpiklanni are probably the ones most likely to have a wider appeal to those who are not fans of folk metal or even heavy metal which is why I would place them on a "Best 4" list. (Insert whichever band you like as number 4; I don't believe Finntroll or Arkona are easily accessible despite being two of my favourite bands.) 
p4220
aVWhich were the 2 you didn't know?  And I agree with pretty much everything you said.
p4221
aVHeljareyga, and Irminsul.  Never heard of them before :P\u000a
p4222
aVHeljareyga is Heri Joensen's side project.  They're like old Tyr with a lot of progressive influences.  Irminsul is a really obscure folk-melodeathish band from Sweden that I found by accident.  Their really good I think.
p4223
aVYeah I found out as soon as I listened to them both.  I found Heljareyga too be way too similar to Tyr (go figure; it basically is the same) for my liking, but Irminsul sounded great.\u000a\u000aThanks for introducing me to some new great bands.
p4224
aVI think Heljareyga sounds like older Tyr but a bit more upbeat and proggy.  I'm hoping their next album can fill the void that new Tyr left behind.
p4225
aVMoonsorrow, Finntroll, Ensiferum, Eluveitie
p4226
aVEnsiferum, Korpiklaani, Tyr, and Turisas. At least, that's my approach to it.
p4227
aVEluveitie, Korpiklaani, Alestorm and Finntroll.\u000a\u000aI think we should put this to a vote.\u000a\u000a
p4228
aVOn a side note, it's amazing how much folk metal has grown in popularity and acceptance in recent years (sounding like a hipster now but fuck it), here in the UK when I was introduced to folk metal a good decade or so ago, it was really unknown and pretty niche, but now these bands are selling out pretty sizeable venues and are given major coverage by mainstream metal media. Still, my chances of forming a folk metal band are nonetheless slim at best.
p4229
aVIf "Folk Metal" means metal mixed with folk elements, from whatever culture, I would seriously add Orphaned Land in the top 10. Maybe not the top 4 since the most recent album is not really good, but so is Ensiferum's.
p4230
aVWell if its following the rules of the thrash big four it would have to be with worst 4 folk metal bands...not the 4 best
p4231
aV1. Korpiklaani\u000a2. Ensiferum\u000a3. Blind Guardian \u000a4. Fintroll \u000a\u000aIf it were choice by favorites I'd substitute Elvenking for Fintroll.
p4232
aVAs much as I love Blind Guardian, they are power metal, not folk metal.
p4233
aV[deleted]
p4234
aVProbably because it's a stretch to call them folk, nobody would deny they're an amazingly talented and popular band though. Unless you're enough of a hipster to dislike anything simply because it is "trending" anyways.
p4235
aVWintersun are one of the best bands out there but I've never seen anyone call them folk.
p4236
aVYeah, I think Wintersun is more melodic death metal.

V[Månegarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icj3NKngKus) have flutes in some tracks. [Subway to Sally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAx15rDftV4) also have flutes in a lot of tracks. Same thing with In Extremo, even though I can't think of any particular tracks off the top of my head. Some bands with middle eastern folk influenses like [Orphaned Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXRBjykFpIk) and [Amaseffer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJIJzuN7O6o) often use flutes. [Oathean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkSrRl7tAcA) have a couple of tracks with flutes. [Kranium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7djiLUXz7w) use lots of flutes on their very unique album Testimonios. [Negura Bunget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbXYSJLod9o) sometimes play the flute too. They have some folk influenses, even though I wouldn't call them a folk metal band. I'm sure I'll think of more later.\u000a\u000aYou'll find the best flute-playing in progressive rock though.

p4291
aVAlbum came out in 2011, not exactly new.  I've known about this band for a couple years and just figured it was NDH and not Folk Metal.  Those two genres really evoke the same things for me, but not for everyone.  Early Letzte Instanz is also violin-heavy NDH that sounds folky.  There is a languishing /r/NDH, perhaps some of us here might be interested in.

aVIt's kind of hard to not decline after Slania though. It was a really good album.
p4342
aVSlania was fucking amazing, but I think they've been growing, not getting worse. They've progressively gotten heavier with each album and while I loved that I always missed the folk heavy stuff from Slania and Spirit. It looks like Origins will have the heaviness AND tons of folk, which is exactly what I've been waiting for
p4343
aVSo happy I got the special mail order box. Can't fucking wait. \u000a
p4344
aVSame. Although I'm still going to try and avoid the (huuuge) temptation of listening the album in advance.
p4345
aVSame too haha but its quite the temptation but not too bad because I know I'll like it better if I hear it when the CD is actually released. Otherwise I feel like I'm cheating
p4346
aVAhh. Eluveitie is one of my favourite folk metal bands, I actually got to meet them and chill in their tour bus for a while. Not sure how I feel about this song quite yet. It's lacking the iconic "clean" feeling in the song. Maybe the melody needs to be a little more pronounced? It's more blended than their past albums. Still incredible though.
p4347
aV&gt;I actually got to meet them and chill in their tour bus for a while.\u000a\u000aLucky you.\u000a\u000a&gt;It's lacking the iconic "clean" feeling in the song. Maybe the melody needs to be a little more pronounced? It's more blended than their past albums.\u000a\u000aI think that is because of the low bit rate. I think they uploaded lower quality because album is immediately going to be on torrent sites, so if you want nice quality you got to buy a cd, or wait for someone to buy it and leak it in high quality.
p4348
aVI'd post pics but I'm too lazy to go find them haha. Got to have a hurdy gurdy lesson from Anna who was impressed by my knowledge that I already had of her instrument.\u000a\u000aYou might be right about the bit rate, however I do not usually notice music quality changes. Guess I'll have to buy the CD and see if I'm wrong.
p4349
aVAnna is awesome and unique as the instrument she plays.
p4350
aVThe difference in quality is a lot more obvious with bands like Eluveitie. With so many different instruments in the mix, compared to the 4 instruments plus the singer of the average metal band it starts to get way muddier.
p4351
aVIf anyone likes trivia, I think the folk song played prominently during the bridge is Paddy's Lamentation.

(the list is from an advert in a music magazine I'm subscribed to). Many of his albums (excluding this one) have a big story that goes on from album to album.

aVPretty excited for this. Probably my joint favourite band right now alongside their countrymen Mael Mordha. The state of my panties if they were to tour together. (Throw in Cruachan or Waylander too for good measure)
p4439
aVWait, cheery? Primordial? Which Primordial are we talking about here? Because the Irish folk/atmospheric metal band I'm thinking about is anything but cheery.
p4440
aVThey challenge those boundaries by being one of the only folk metal bands not to adhere to the notion that folk metal has to be cheery.
p4441
aVI can think of a bunch of not-cheery folk metal bands. Amon Amarth, Moonsorrow, old Tyr, Thyrfing...
p4442
aVOne between many, and quite frankly, of all those Primordial are the ones that truly change more often.\u000a\u000aAmon Amarth, i love them, but they are cheery, they are battle folk whatever and they make the blood pump. Moonsorrow have their own gimmick, but their hardly dark and innovative, Tyr dance between the line of cheery and hard, and i do agree, they tend to be more progressive than other folk bands, just not as challenging as Primordial and Thyrfing are quite, quite boring and generic.\u000a\u000aComparing the recent works of all these with Primordial... Primordial come out on top. They're darker, more serious and musically they are more daring than all of those.
p4443
aVHonestly... it's more just that the "cheery" ones also happen to be the most popular/well known. I'd even wager to say that most folk metal bands are unlike the "party metal" of a lot of Alestorm/Korpiklaani/what have you (even if a good chunk/most fall more to the "cheery" side).\u000a\u000aI could name quite a non-cheery ones- although probably not as dark as Primordial... but they're still not nearly so light-hearded as just singing about booze and victory. Also at the same time, Primordial is pretty light on the "folk." 
p4444
aVWhat i think of this album is that Primordial are folk, they are darker than most folk bands with equal stature and they experiment more with their sound. They have riffs that resemble classic doom in this work, but they keep them in a folk metal setting. That is the difference between them and all the other. While many bands aim to break away from the mold of traditional folk metal, they truly don't achieve it. Primordial with this album were able to create a folk setting where their black metal influences and traditional doom sounds were not completely displaced. That is what makes them different, that is what enables them to break the boundaries of the cheery folk metal that so many bands of equal stature can't seem to shake.

aVI was going to say the same thing.

I'm sure you're going to find some nice songs.\u000a\u000aSummoning has a lot of awesome songs based on the Lord of the rings lore.
p4587
aVI've listened to a lot of Korpiklaani, and some Arkona. I like this sort of thing, but I was just thinking that I've never heard a metal adaptation of any child ballad. Even the Twa Corbies. Which is weird, because every non-metal folk singer has recorded some child ballads, and plenty of the have pretty metal subject matter. The Twa Corbies is a dialog between two crows talking about eating a dead knight, for god's sake. \u000a\u000aWell, if no one here knows of any, I guess I'll go hunting through metal-archives myself.
p4588
aVMy bad, IN extremo is actually the "Herr Manneling". I'm not sure if this is a child ballad but it is a ballad of a troll who got inlove with a knight.\u000ahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herr_Mannelig
p4589
aVI'll try it, thanks! It's not a child ballad, as those are specifically Anglo-Scots ballads (also found in places where Anglos and Scots emigrated) collected by Francis James Child in the late 19th century. It is traditional, though, so it's closer to what I'm looking for.

p4643
(lp4644
VBagpipes are not leading songs like previous albums.  Almost a death metal sound more than folk.  I like it but for different reasons than their other releases.  I do miss an "anthem" song with a good chant to sing along with.
p4645
aVExactly! Like I wanted a chant like the title track of onwards into battle, or something fast and fun like by the hammer they fall. 
p4646
aVI think their new sound fits with the "war is grim and has always been" theme they have on the album. It feels heavier and darker compared to the romanticized viking feast in their old stuff. I don't think it is bland nor boring, but I was expecting something else and I do feel a bit dissapointed. The thing is that it feels less so the more I listen to it and I think that I might really enjoy it in the future. I am just going to have to put the new and old songs in different playlists. 
p4647
aVI think you hit the nail right on the head. I've been listening to it again, but approaching it as a more death/viking metal album as opposed to pure folk, and I'm enjoying it a lot more. That being said I hope we see a return of their pure folk sound

The good songs were amazing, but there was a lot of "meh" in between.  Stand Up and Fight really marked an improvement in the song writing and arrangements.  That was their first album I enjoyed from beginning to end.  \u000a\u000aWhile people dislike the wandering from the "Viking" path, the new songs are very good.  However visually it's quite an odd combination for a bunch of face-painted warriors to be singing about modern issues like "Fear the Fear."  The only downside I've heard so far in the new album is the fucking weird sex section of "Run Bhang-Eater, Run!"  You can be certain I won't be playing that song through my speakers at home...

p4712
aVTorsteins Kvæði is probably one of my favorite Tyr versions of folk songs. 
p4713
aVArguably they are the most folk of all folk metal bands, without even using any folk instruments.  No other band (that I know of) uses so many traditional melodies and direct translations of ancient lyrics.\u000a\u000aAlso recommending Ramund Hin Unge, Regin Smidur, and of course, Sinklars Visa!

p4718
aVDude totally, I picked up their first two releases like a month ago. Really digging so I just got The Mantle.
p4719
aVMoonsorrow are probably one of the best folk metal bands out there if you like LONG sweeping songs.  \u000a\u000aHere's an instrumental from one of their best albums: [Tuulen Tytär/Soturin Tie] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRpdakf-k9o)
p4720
aVWhat about [Hedningarna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedningarna)? [Faun](http://faune.de) is also another excellent folk band from Germany.
p4721

p4722
aVAck! Totally missed your edit. ;) Glad you like them, regardless.
p4723
aVYou probably already know about these guys, but definitely Corvus Corax.  Also, Skyforger has one all folk album, called Sword Song.
p4724
aVI've heard of CC but never actually heard any of their stuff. I'll check it out, thanks.
p4725
aVAlso, there's Eluveitie's Evocation I album, which is all acoustic.
p4726
aVAnd is so good that they probably should think about dropping the metal all together. I hardly listen to anything else of theirs any longer. Word on the street is that their new album will be acoustic, too. Pretty damn excited.
p4727
aVMe too, I just listened to Evocation again yesterday.  Definitely one of their better albums.
p4728
aVValravn is arguably more electronic than heavy, but you may like them.  Dalriada (or Echo of Dalriada earlier) is generally considered folk metal, though not incredibly heavy or Scandinavian.  Stary Olsa is also not very Scandinavian.  Dunkelschön, maybe?  Odroerir, Skyforger's Zobena Dziesma album, I don't know, I'm stretching.  Maybe comment on those and see if other people can branch out from that?
p4729
aVJust gave Valravn a listen, yeah I am definitely liking this. Kinda Bjorky. Thanks, I'll check out your other suggestions.
p4730
aVTry [Tuatha de Danann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatha_de_Danann_%28band%29), not Scandinavian folk but have a good mix of clean and metal. 
p4731
aVA couple more, [Metsatöll](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--i3pwGGabE) probably have fewer shreddy songs than folky songs, though it is a mix of both.  The folk instruments are used to greater effect than pretty much any other band I've ever heard; like the metal is secondary to the folk as opposed to every other folk metal band.  For 100% traditional, look at [Krauka](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CZpJ2Osrtw).
p4732
aVMost of the ones I know of have been mentioned, but I can think of a couple more...\u000a\u000a[Poropetra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnyuiHz0NQ) from Finland.

p4733
aVThanks, I've actually been listening to Maddji on youtube. I think it's time I pick up her album. I bought a few Falkenbach albums a while back, and I remember them going folk song - black metal song - folk song - black metal song. Didn't really mix the two together and I found it kind of disjointed. Is that a theme with them, or are there albums with more of a blend you would recommend? I do remember really liking their drummer.

aVI suppose, it's also popular in /r/powermetal, courtesy of Blind Guardian I guess\u000a\u000ait's not limited to genre, it's often used more as a theme
p4771
aVI really don't think of BG when I think of Mittelalter Metal.  As to where to put it, I've posted some here and asked if people know of a better spot.  No one does.  I say post it here until it needs a new sub.\u000a\u000aPower metal seems to stem more from fantasy, while folk metal and Mittelatler metal both use traditional instruments and melodies.

VIt always amazes me how well these guys do abroad. I've seen them grow from a small local band to a full-fledged worldwide touring group and I would never have guessed that such local subject matter (although a lot is based on the wider Germanic mythology) and a relatively unknown language could have such wide reach among folk metal fans. 
p4783
aVAnd I guess that's exactly what makes them so special and well liked by folk metal fans. They're not a copy of any other well known band, they developed their own style - I mean, they have two male singers, clean vocals and Dutch lyrics, that's rather unique and sounds very authentic.
p4784
aVSaw them yesterday with the new singer. He's great, got a nice introduction from the band. Shame the vocals where a bit low on volume in the mix (i guess that was on purpose for the first live event with the new singer).

p4823
aVGreat:) I might send you a message anout it sometime in the future
p4824
aVI know I am late to this party, but I just listened to your stuff! Great work! Really well composed stuff! As a producer, my only bit of advice is to try to add better definition to your individual tracks. Especially when mixing guitar, if you can get into the habit of putting each guitar in its own "pitch range" (keep rhythm low on the neck, and put lead higher) they will be more easily distinguished. Even try using a different pickup when recording harmony parts then when you record the main lead. You will be amazed at the difference. You are definitely on the right track man! Big big props to you!
p4825
aVThanks! I'll make sure to keep that in mind in the future.

p4844
aVBetter than Sagas? wow, I'm even more excited now.
p4845
aVMhm. Its their best album in terms of atmosphere and production. I'd definitely say "Apokalypse", "Stein meiner Ahnen" and "Ankunft" are the best songs on the album.  \u000aSagas is probably still my *favorite* album though because it was the first metal album I ever bought and some of the songs are just unbeatable. :P
p4846
aVI'm still undecided if it's better than Sagas and Turis Fratyr, but it definitely better than Rekreatur.
p4847
aVI liked Rekreatur...
p4848
aVIt wasn't bad, of course, but in my opinion it was their weakest album, probably because it was straight after the switch from Helge.
p4849
aVListened to it in the car this morning. It's alright and certainly better than Rekreatur as a whole but that's it, sadly. I feel like the big selling point of this album is 'Waldschrein', like 'Der Ewige Sieg' was for Rekreatur or 'Blut im Auge'/'Unbesiegt' on Sagas. And I feel it's quite a bit weaker than all three of those.  \u000a'Stein meiner Ahnen' is quite nice, it has a Turis Fratyr vibe, at least lyrically.  \u000a  \u000aWhat I also noticed was, that the vocals are a lot further in the background than on their earlier albums. Not sure if that's something to do with Robse's style but I liked it better when the vocals had a more central role. (Liked Helge's vocals better as well.)  \u000a  \u000aSolid album altogether, just not worldshaking.\u000a
p4850
aVDid you notice that Waldschrein on this album is a bit different from on the [EP release](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjKJlKQ50wE)? It's mainly small tweaks, but the ending has been amped up a bit, in my opinion, and the vocals are further in the background like you said.
p4851
aVNice, thanks for that, I hadn't listened to the EP. It feels like the album version is a blend of the EP version and the acoustic version also on the EP.  \u000aWhile the album version feels more refined, the EP version is more fun to listen to, imo.
p4852
aVI pre-ordered the album after hearing the short clip of "Uns'rer Flöten Klang" from the track-by-track previews, and now that I've heard the full track it was 100% worth it for that alone.\u000a\u000aI haven't gotten to listen to the rest of the album yet, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if Erdentempel is even better than Sagas.\u000a\u000a

aVWait, *the* Michael Schumacher? Or is it someone else?
p4854
aVNot sure. I don't recognize the name.\u000a\u000aEdit: oh, he's a racer. Interesting.

aVHe's been in a coma after a serious brain injury at the end of last year. He may never come out of it, and if he does, he will probably need to re-learn how to speak and feed himself.

aVDunno, I love the rawness of the original. :) But okay, after having listened to it something like a few hundred times according to last.fm (15th most all-time, apparently), it's getting a little hard to judge.\u000a\u000aAllow me to fanboy a bit then: Always enjoyed the faster songs from the from Trollskau the most, and the new song is absolutely fucking fantastic! Listened to it a bunch of times in office before I reached the conclusion that I had to get to Systembolaget before they closed, so I could listen to properly when I got home. Then I did that. A couple of highlights include at 0:38 when one thinks "wow, neat high", but then it turns out that the actual high is at 0:40 instead. Also, the stuff around the 'switch' at 4:50 and onwards. And all the stuff in between.
p4865
aV&gt; And all the stuff in between.\u000a\u000alol, I'm glad to hear you like it! The part that starts at 3:07 is a new personal best for me, never knew I had it in me to sing like that. What the fuck voice, you can do *that*?
p4866
aVYou sound a lot like Heri from Tyr during that part, in the best way possible.
p4867
aVThanks! I found the album on Google Music and have been giving it a listen. :)
p4868
aVThe song is great, but we awaited so many years for something already heard... it sounds too similar to Vintersorg
p4869
aVWhich Vintersorg era? I haven't heard anything post-Cosmic Genesis myself. Maybe it's time to check out the new stuff, haha.
p4870
aVMainly the new one, in my opinion Orkan and Naturbal are really good (Jordpuls is also a good listen), especially the last one reminds a bit his side-project called Cronian... he's making good music by the way :D

aVJaldaboath are brilliant. I've been following James Fogarty (Grand Master Jaldaboath)'s musical career like a huge nerd ever since hearing [this track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRMfTz1_j6U) from Ewigkeit's *Radio Ixtlan* on an Earache sampler, during his brief brush with the fringes of the mainstream. The man is an absolute nutter in the best sense of the word, and everything he's done (Early Meads of Asphodel, Ewigkeit, Blacksmoke, Old Forest, The Bombs of Enduring Freedom, Feral Underclass, Jaldaboath etc.) is brilliant and very strange. Especially when you consider that a lot of his stuff was just produced by himself in his flat. It's good to see he seems to be finally getting some recognition; I saw a few people at Wacken this year in Jaldaboath shirts (I myself occasionally sport a limited edition 'Axe Wielding Nuns' shirt).

VHope you enjoyed the show! Austin was a pretty wild last night of tour :)\u000a\u000aOther influences were Turisas, Korpiklaani, and Rhapsody. Maybe a few other bands here and there, but I had a very limited musical taste. However, since those bands have all recently started turning out crap albums that disappear up their own arseholes, these days they're more of a reference for "what not to do" :)\u000a\u000aOh, also our original guitarist (Gavin) was an alexi laiho fanboy, I guess that found its way into some of our guitar parts too.
p4924
aVYou're right about it being a wild show. I'm just shocked you guys were able to cope so well with the copious softcore porno on the televisions.

aV[deleted]

aV&gt; Running Wild\u000a\u000aRunning Wild doesn't have the same folk element in their music that was such a big part of Piratefest 2015.

aV[deleted]
p4942
aVHarsh. And I didn't hate them. Just not really my thing. I'm gonna check out the other songs for sure though. Yeah, it's definitely a cool genre and I think it can grow on me. I didn't like Finntroll or Amon Amarth for a good while, but I came around.
p4943
aVSame here. I really disliked and even hated them when i first heard them but now FinnTroll is easily my favorite band of all time.\u000a\u000aFunny how metal grows on you like that. It's different from other genres. Other genres, like pop, are pretty much designed so that the listener instantly likes it, so that the song catches in the brain and stays there. It requires no effort or input from the listener because the music is essentially "engineered" to be pleasing. It is equivalent to a fast-food cheeseburger, just straight what the brain is craving, no digestion or nutrients required.\u000a\u000aMetal on the other hand is thai food cooked in a five star restaurant. An extremely acquired taste that demands the consumer is knowledgeable and accustomed to the possible experience. The first time they taste it, they might not like it but on subsequent tastings they grow fond of it.
p4944
aVhah that's perfect. 100% agree about the pop music. though I do enjoy my fast food here and there lol, but not pop music.
p4945
aVI'm a full time student and I still have to work a little so unfortunately fast food is a big part of my life : (
p4946
aVI'm liking it but I don't hear the cowboy part. I was expecting along the lines of Dezperadoz.
p4947
aVI'd have to agree.  My original sentiment was "Amazing how "Cowboy metal" sounds exactly the same as European Folk metal."  \u000a\u000aI'm not particularly a fan of all these  "new genres" purely based around lyrical themes.  I personally think a genre should define the sound and not the themes.  For instance; Alestorm, while called "Pirate metal" are undoubtedly pure folk metal while singing about pirates.  \u000a\u000aThis band are good and I did enjoy the song enough to watch another video of theirs.  It sounds a lot like Wintersun from their first album or Ensiferum.  Definitely not a bad thing.
p4948
aVI'm all for new genres. Dezperadoz does the cowboy thing quite well, a nice mix of twang and german thrash. I would LOVE to hear more Chet Atkins kind of stuff mixed with a power metal sound.
p4949
aVI agree to an extent but I think the genre that defines a band is established by the fans, not the band.  I think almost all musicians and bands strive to be unique and part of that is to say "Hey, we're not just folk metal, we're Cowboy Metal!" in order to differentiate themselves from the pack.  But a lot of the time, their music DOES fit into pre-existing genres, yet most musicians feel that falling into an already existing category is some sort of musical conformity.  \u000a\u000aGenres are MASSIVE.  Not all power metal sounds the same.  Who can say that all Symphonic metal bands play the exact same style of music?  If anything these genres allow us to categorize different sounds so that we can find similar music that we enjoy.  \u000a\u000aAs a composer myself, I used to constantly think that I had to create some amazing new genre in order to be unique.  That's not the case.  You don't have to decide that your Gothic Metal is actually "Blackened Doom Symphonic Goth Metal" because Gothic Metal is a massive genre which already covers all the features of your music.  \u000a\u000aThis has really strayed from the point and become more of a comment on the desire of bands to try and make themselves unique when they don't have to.  A pre-defined genre shouldn't cripple your music, but instead attract fans of that style.  Genres aren't scary monsters musicians should run away from, but instead something to embrace.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I'm off to work now; have a nice day :)\u000a\u000a\u000a
p4950
aVIf you're looking for cowboy metal, I can't recommend [Dezperadoz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRv1Mc7f9Nw) enough.  [Redwest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEIu_G-10H8) is pretty good too.

p5003
aVTyr was the first band, I was curious about Scandinavian folk music,  Tyr kept getting mentioned, now I'm a huge fan.\u000a\u000aProgressing from there, I've picked up several bands I really enjoy.  I'm a pretty big history buff, so music that blends the sounds and stories of Pre-Christian (and in some cases Pre-Roman) cultures just fascinates me, and in some cases has been a jumping off point to learn more about these cultures.
p5004
aVIt's hard to tell why, but I can tell you who. \u000a\u000aFirst there was korpikaani, then alestorm, then I think it was Turisas, and so on. \u000a\u000aI don't know. I guess I just like music about the olden days and songs that tell tales of adventure. That and unique instruments you don't hear too often anymore. 
p5005
aVCame for Finsterforst, stayed for everything else. Ive only started into the genre about 3 months ago and didn't even know I loved folk metal til them. As I dive deeper down the rabbit hole I've learned 2 things; I have no idea what anyone is saying, and I need more.
p5006
aVEnsiferum in 2001. It was actually the first thing I *ever* bought from the Internet - bought the album off of the spinefarm.fi website with my dad's credit card (I was still in high school; I gave him the cash for it, don't worry). I remember both of us being so worried about giving the Internet our credit information.\u000a\u000aOriginally heard 'Token of Time' on "the metal channel" in 2001. This was when we first got digital cable and they had all those extra music channels. It was like channel 511.\u000a\u000aLater that year I discovered Skyclad, which I found to be a lot more folky than Ensiferum and I really, really liked that sound. I've been hooked ever since.
p5007
aV[deleted]
p5008
aVThe first metal album I ever listened to was Turisas's *The Varangian Way*, which I bought after seeing one of their concerts on some obscure Sky music channel. It wasn't until quite a few years later that I started to properly get into metal, but I guess you could say folk metal was my introduction to whole genre. 
p5009
aVGot invited to Paganfest with Ensiferum headlining, and Turisias, Elvuaitie, and TYR playing as well. Had no idea who any of those bands were the day of the show. Walked out of that concert a changed man.
p5010
aVSide note, I think I actually got a friend request MySpace FROM Wintersun when they first came out.
p5011
aVArkona got me into it and them, Tyr, Ensiferum and Stribog keep me
p5012
aVI grew up a solid diet of folk and musicals as a kid. Then my high school girlfriend got me into HIM. I looked around the Finnish music scene and found Korpiklaani. 
p5013
aVBagpipes.  Just bagpipes.  That is all.
p5014
aVI can't remember, I do remember being blown away by Eluveitie. Inis Mona had just... wow. I have listened to all kinds of folk metal, but it's kind of a blur.\u000a\u000aAs for now... medieval. Mittelalter? (Can't spell, sorry.) I haven't been listening to much else than Subway To Sally (who I probably found via Eluveitie Radio on some streaming service), Saltatio Mortis, In Extremo... I'm not sure if Faun counts.\u000a\u000aI can't take harsh growls as well as I used to, so I don't listen to as much folk metal as there is out there now. I love how diverse the cultures in folk metal are though (like the folk aspect of it). \u000a\u000aEdit: type Eluveitie into any streaming radio service. (Like base a station off of Eluveitie music.) The amount of bands I have found this way is incredible.\u000a\u000aEdit 2: I joke that I like anything with bagpipes, hurdy gurdy or both.
p5015
aVI first listened to Eluveitie's Your Gaulish War when that was the song playing over a youtube video about Paganism 3 years ago. I loved it and I wanted to know what the band is that made it. I searched in the comments and someone said it was Eluveitie. So I searched them up and I didn't know that this kind of music existed. I was't a metal fan at all to begin with and I was going through a phase when I listened to country and Dubstep (I was in middle school guys). At first I couldn't get Chrigel's growls but I gradually accepted them as the vast majority of Eluveitie's songs featured them. I then found bands like Finntroll and Arkona and Ensiferum. Because Eluveitie was my first metal band they are my perpetual favorite band alongside Finntroll as Nifelvind is one of my favorite albums of all time. \u000a\u000aBecause I've not really have heard any recent Folk Metal that has blown me away, I've gotten into other metal sub genres like Norwegian Black Metal with bands like Gorgoroth, Dimmu Borgir, Tsjuder, Taake, Carach Angren, and Opera IX. The only Folk Metal band that has come close to Finntroll and Eluveitie would be Munarheim and their cover song The Last Unicorn and their recent song Nachtmelodie. I'm sorry to say that I'm not really into Folk Metal that I used to as Folk Metal is not as visceral and terrifying as pure Black Metal. I'm just saying that I feel more energy watching a video of Black Mass Krakow 2004 than a video of Paganfest.
p5016
aVActually myspace classified Turisas as black metal at least ten years ago so I gave them a listen. Not what I considered black metal but it turned me on to the epicness that is folk metal. 
p5017
aVThat's pretty strange. The same person who classified them probably thinks Linkin Park is metal.
p5018
aVI first got into folk metal after exploring Turisas, specifically through their album Battle Metal. I later started to get into Ensiferum and Korpiklaani. I was a HUGE Dimmu Borgir fan before that. But after discovering that the folky side to metal can be awesome, I found that I really started to appreciate the melody and acoustics behind them. Some days, all I'll listen to are the instrumental/acoustic songs in certain folk-metal albums. \u000a\u000aFor instance, I really enjoy Finntroll's [Visor om slutet](http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Finntroll/Visor_om_slutet/17534/) - it's a purely acoustic folk, no metal. 
p5019
aVTýr - Regin Smiður\u000a\u000aSo my story goes like this:  There used to be some rogue metal internet radio station. People could pick songs out of a list to play - but it was all stuff you've never heard on the radio. Maybe the artists, but not the songs. I came across Blind Guardian, who I couldn't get enough of. So I started looking up their stuff on Youtube, and came across the aforementioned Tyr song. It was amazing, nothing what I've heard before!\u000a\u000aWhat keeps me a fan is the lore, the harmonics and melodies like you said, and that many bands use folk instruments.
p5020
aVThere is still a place like that which exists! There's a small community of Groove shark that does broadcasts of folk metal which allows you to suggest songs. I learned a lot that way 
p5021
aVI've always listened to a lot of different music, classic rock, alt rock, "mainstream" metal and hard rock and stuff like that, as well as stuff like DNB etc. A couple of years ago I started listening to Power Metal and in one of the videos I watched linked to Korpiklaani. After clicking through recommended links I hit up piratebay to see how long the music lasted on my ears before I started to buy albums. \u000a\u000aI'm still listening to Folk Metal now because its just so different everything else I listen to, hell the closest that folk metal comes to my rock tastes is Skyclad, and thats still pretty different, just without the growls and screams of everything else. The genre just has everything I like between Hard Rock-"Regular" metal and more.
p5022
aVKinda a weird one thing lead to another story.\u000a\u000aFather listens to folk music both New England sea faring kind and Celtic. Mother with stuff like Bob Dylan, Aerosmith, Rolling Stones, etc. I kept a liking to to both parents type but also explored my own liking and tastes. \u000a\u000aI went with liking Rammstein as my first foreign band when I was first introduced to them in high school German class. While exploring herzelied.com for lyrics I saw some recommendations/ads for Tanzwut and In Extremo and liked them a lot. \u000a\u000aThen one day I got bored and watched some muppets shows and started watching the Swedish chef when one linked to him lip syncing Korpiklaani's Wooden Pints. I grew very interested and listened to more of their music and finally discovered they are part of FOLK METAL. Going back and seeing Tanzwut and In Extremo were folk metal I knew this was a genre I liked a lot. And pretty much from there I just went deeper and deeper and fell in love ever since with the genre and this subreddit has only helped open more doors to discovering other bands from all over Europe and Asia. \u000a\u000aI love the music similar to OP with harmonics and melodies. I also like how with each band brings a bit of their culture and instruments to the table so it is also an anti-xenophobia kinda  experience with meeting people through their music. A different taste to the bland radio auto-tune music and how every singer/band sounds similar. Also it feels like home with having music that is sorta a love child from my parents own music.

aV1&amp;2: Ensiferum and Turisas mainly.\u000a\u000a (I just discovered folk metal recently, and unfortunately not years ago. So I don't even know if my answers can count haha.)\u000a\u000aWanderer was the first folk metal song I heard as well and I thought fuck yeah I love this. I've really gotten into Ensiferum, Turisas, and Korpiklaani (I think they sound more folk punk but what do I know). I dig Tyr and Alestorm as well.\u000a\u000aAfter listening to all the Ensiferum albums I'm interested to hear their newest.
p5025
aVBy accident really. Plus I really love folk music in general. One day I was looking at Celtic folk music on youtube and stumbled on to this song by Suidakra:\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jLIYEsC-84\u000a\u000aAfter that I was immediately hooked. Folk metal then got me into melodeath and power metal, and metal as a whole. I still love Folk Metal the best because of its harmonic/melodic elements like you said, and also because it was Folk Metal that opened me up to a whole new world of music.\u000a\u000aAlso, I completely agree with you that Folk Metal is the perfect music to workout to. Nothing like pumping some iron while listening to epic riffs and battle chants blasting in your ears.

aVFor the most part, it was an accident. I originally wanted to explore other types of music besides rap so I started listening rock and screamo when I was young. And then one day, in the recommended videos section of Youtube, was 'Blut Im Auge' by Equilibrium and I was hooked for a little bit more than six years ago. Since then, I've delved more into Folk Metal and now, Eluveitie, Wintersun, and Korpikklanni are what I listen to the most.\u000aWhat kept me as a fan? Well, tbh, Folk Metal is the only type of music that can lull me to sleep and then excite and make my heart race in just a single verse. 
p5029
aVI grew up listening to Irish music and got into metal pretty early so hearing my two favorite styles of music combined was like a dream come true.
p5030
aVI started with Týr. In fact, [Ormurin Langi]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtjksfgCp0I) is the first metal song that I specifically remember hearing (I'd almost certainly heard some before but that was the first song that stuck with me). But Moonsorrow is definitely the band keeping me in folk metal.
p5031
aVWhen I was 14 some kids were listening metal around me. So I tried it, too. It stuck with me. When I became 16 and MP3 players became a thing which you could fit more than 12 songs on I started looking for all sorts of bands in the metal genre. A7x, SOAD, Metallica, Megadeth. Some youtubers like Sandy Ravage heavily influence some of those choices. \u000a\u000aSo eventually I got into Folk music as well, and it just mixed over time. I discovered Folk Punk and Folk Metal was only so far further.

aVCheck out genres like gothic americana, gothic country, and deathcountry. Some of my favorite bands in those are [Slackeye Slim](https://slackeyeslim.bandcamp.com/track/dont-touch-my-horse-2010-version), [Those Poor Bastards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326WpN3wMUo), and [Sons of Perdition](http://sonsofperdition.bandcamp.com/track/the-legend-of-saw-jones).

aVI remember Sabaton saying that the main melody of their song [To Hell and Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfur_S06CwA) was a sort of a tribute to Ennio Morricone.

aVI honestly can't stop listening to Finsterforst latest album. It is folky, epic and very well produced. Especially when compared to their early stuff. 
p5114
aVInteresting picks OP- Lumsk and OTYG were the two bands that got me into folk metal and I hardly ever see them mentioned.
p5115
aVI am in love with Svartsot's Maledictus Eris, Krampus' Survival of the Fittest and Furor Gallico's self titled. Those to me are some of the best folk albums ever created. Every song is great and memorable!

p5122
aVThank you on the heidevolk suggestion. I'd actually apparently heard one of their songs in some mix somewhere.
p5123
aVI get you on being able to understand the lyrics. I'm not a big fan of unintelligible vocals either, but I've been able to make some exceptions. These are a couple of my recommendations for you to explore, but none of them are *exactly* like Týr, so you get to have some fun exploring.\u000a\u000a**Equilibrium:** Folk metal with a driving pace. These guys do a fair bit of growling, but it's great stuff. I wasn't into them that much until I heard their latest album, **Erdentempel**, which I loved. I recommend beginning with that one.\u000a\u000a**Sabaton:** Power Metal, nothing folky about them. They sing about World War 2 and many other conflicts. Clean vocals, driving pace, and heavy, militant, drumming. Great Power Metal. Again, I wasn't really too into them until recently. I recommend both their latest album, **Heroes**, and **Carolous Rex**. Both are great. I listened to Carolous Rex twice this past Tuesday.\u000a\u000aI'd start there. Everything I recommended is available on Spotify for starters. I could go on a bit, but I feel I'd be getting farther from Týr and just start naming bands I like.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Ooh, almost forgot; **Turisas**! Power metal with a little bit of folk thrown in. Mostly intelligible lyrics and melodic. They've got a great cover of [Rasputin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdkBs0VCSX0), and I would recommend starting with **Battle Metal**
p5124
aVI don't have anything else to suggest, but I completely back up everything you've suggested. It's hard for me to find bands similar to Tyr to recommend. I saw them last August at the Granada in Dallas, and honestly I was impressed at the presence they had for a four piece. I don't know why, but I always assumed there were more than four of them.
p5125
aVFully backing Turisas and Equilibrium here. Equilibrium's album "Sagas" is also fantastic.
p5126
aVI was introduced to Equilibrium when a friend played Mana for me. What a song!
p5127
aVThey really don't have a bad song, IMO. Probably my favorite German metal band right now.
p5128
aVEh, there's some "meh" songs on Erdentempel, but other than that I definitely agree with you. I also saw them live twice last year and it was a blast :)
p5129
aV*HELJAREYGA*!!! A couple members of Tyr are in the band, including vocalist.\u000a\u000a[Heljareyga - Heljareyga](http://youtu.be/7T73hBjO-D8)\u000a\u000a

aVI see Triddana/Skiltron is finally starting to get popular on this sub. Nice.
p5135
aVStille Volk is one of my favorite bands. However they're not metal in any way. Still worth checking out though. 
p5136
aVYou're right, I just listed a couple of folk bands that have clean vocals. I am often forgetting they're not even metal :O
p5137
aVTurisas, Sabaton, have already been mentioned but I can't give enough upvotes so I'm going to say them again ;)\u000a\u000aFalconer is solid. \u000a\u000aActually pretty much anything off of [this list](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/T%C3%BDr/14435). (er... if it doesn't link properly, the "similar artists" tab). \u000a\u000aMaybe also Wintersun?\u000a\u000aI think Ensiferum and Finntroll are pretty similar to Tyr, but not in vocal quality which seems to be what you're looking for.\u000a\u000a
p5138
aVI'm definitely going to double up on Falconer and Turisas, they're awesome. Turisas does growls a bunch, but they've always got clean vocals to balance it out.\u000a\u000aFalconer always has exclusively clean vocals and sings a ton in Swedish. They do more power than folk, but they've got a particularly folky album that is all in Swedish, *Armod*. They're more along the lines of Valkyrja and The Lay of Thrym than any of the older Tyr material, though (that is to say, more power-y with only a hint of folk in the melodies)
p5139
aVTry In Extremo. Great german folk metal band, if the german lyrics don't bother you. 
p5140
aVI will second Sabaton, Turisas, and Falconer, and add in Alestorm.
p5141
aVJust to be clear, it doesn't have to be in English. I actually somewhat prefer hearing folk metal music sung in native tongues. Especially very minority native tongues (like Tyr with their Faroese).
p5142
aVI've been digging Metsatöll since seeing them with Eluveitie and Tyr last year. Pretty sure it's exclusively in Estonian but the singer's voice is really awesome.
p5143
aVTry Troll Gnet El. They're a Russian folk metal band without any real growling. 
p5144
aVtry Bucovina, a romanian folk metal band, they mostly incorporate clean vocals in their song with just the occasional growl, they are the closest thing to Tyr i can come up with off the top of my head. \u000a\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4STYdEprmko\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCoh2ibRVK4
p5145
aVThere are a [few](http://www.reddit.com/r/folkmetal/comments/15uhgr/folk_metal_with_clean_vocals/) [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/folkmetal/comments/2c75hy/nonscreaminggrowling_folk_metal/) [about](http://www.reddit.com/r/folkmetal/comments/1cscom/brothers_of_metal_i_require_aid/) [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/folkmetal/comments/14pmip/looking_for_some_new_powerfolkthrashy_metal_bands/) on this sub already.  What you are looking for is clean vocals as opposed to harsh vocals.  Týr are also somewhat [progressive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_metal), especially their older albums, which may also be something you are looking for.
p5146
aVSkyforger (from Lithuania) has some very similar songs, structurally, to older Týr (i.e. - if you like things like Sinklars Visa, you'd appreciate some of Skyforger's songs).\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, Skyforger can get into the super extreme range (growling/screaming, etc.) that would be completely divergent from Týr, so it's really hit or miss.\u000a\u000aThat's about as similar as I can find. Been listening to Týr since 2003 and haven't found anything close enough except for, of course, Heljareyga and bits and pieces of Skyforger.\u000a\u000a\u000aEDIT: Like [this](http://youtu.be/A0e2L2_BAvo) is probably what you're looking for. It's similar to Sinklars Visa, just a little more. . .'boring'(?) if that makes sense. 
p5147
aVAlbum version is much better quality (album name is Bannkreis), but:\u000a\u000a[Subway to Sally - Das Rätsel (Live 1997)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwr0O5XqnC8)\u000a\u000aHere also is [Liebeszauber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9oPgn8X1fI) from the album recording.
p5148
aV Eluveitie ! Start with the album Helvetios. Such good stuff. Saw them live, the lead singer had a fuckin quiver full of different flutes. One of the best shows I've ever been to. 
p5149
aVTriddana, korpiklaani (lots of Finnish songs), turisas, heidevolk (Dutch), glittertind (Swedish).\u000a\u000aIf youre interested I will reply more tomorrow.

aVMago de Oz are folk metal with a Spanish flair. Not the same as Tyr, persay, but similar in that they deviate from some folk metal stereotypes.

aVSome of these hvae slight rythmic similarities and others are in no way similar. All you are hearing is often the key of c. I dont agree with any of it. Especially the one you say is "embarassingly plagarized" at 9:50 something or whatever the blither. \u000a\u000aPoint is, both bands heavily use c major, g major, and a harmonic minor. Many folky bands do
p5158
aVIt clearly goes beyond similar keys and having simple rhythms in common. This isn't the only Finterforst song that sounds like it has a lot of Moonsorrow melodies and riffs put into it, in fact the only reason I had heard about Finterforst was because so many people complained about it ripping off Moonsorrow, including the band itself.
p5159
aVThis might not be true with their latest album which I think is quite a bit better than their earlier work.
p5160
aVI don't know what songs are on the newest album but I know the main songwriter of Moonsorrow posted a finterforst song to twitter a couple months ago that he thought was ripping them off. I don't know if that being recent means it's off the new album.
p5161
aVSounds like people are saying that the new album is a rip off of Moonsorrow. I couldn't say I agree. I would take that as a compliment and say that is reason enough to give it a listen. 
p5162
aVThey sound a lot like Moonsorrow, so there is clearly an inspiration but I wouldn't call it rip off. I like both bands.

aVHey man, if Omnia can do it, I can do it!
p5176
aVAround here (Netherlands, but also Belgium/Germany) it seems that a lot of the folk-fans at festivals dress in kilts. Or maybe: the only people wearing kilts at the festivals are folkmetal fans. That and drinking horns (which you can buy there as well) and often leather arm-gear.\u000a\u000a So it depends a bit on your definition and obviously it's not LARP or any attempt at being historically correct. You'll see Celtic, Scottish and Viking/Nordic stuff mixed together, even with a hint of 'pirate' in the mix since the folkmetal people blend in with the pirate-metal folks easily.\u000a\u000aAs for women, I think you see a bit more corsets and long skirts among this crowd than the general metal crowd.

VMana.
p5202
aVWhenever I ask this question to someone I make sure to say excluding Mana.  Keeping that song in is unfair to the rest of the album.
p5203
aVBlut Im Auge has been my favorite since I discovered them (it was the first one I heard by them) but Uns'rer Flüten Klang, Heavy Chill or Wirtshaus Gaudi might replace it
p5204
aVNo love for Snuffel or Wurzelbert?
p5205
aVthose are my two other favorites
p5206
aVYeah dude, Blut um Auge forever
p5207
aVI like so much off of Sagas, but I think my favorite has to be Die Weide und der Fluß. The way it transitions the entire album, and how it comes in from Heiderauche is just beautiful. I love the whole album, as many do, and early on I really like Wurzelbert, Blut Im Auge, and Unbesiegt, but there's just something about the tone of that song that haunts me, and I love it.\u000a\u000aErdentempel is also amazing, of course. I love the variety of the album (though Heavy Chill is sometimes just a little too off the rails for me, though I still like it), and how it brings back some of the folksiness that was lost on Rekreatur. I think my early favorites are Karawane, Uns'rer Floten Klang, and Apokalypse.
p5208
aVUnbesiegt off of Sagas, Uns'rer Floten Klang off of Erdentempel
p5209
aVDefinitely Unbesiegt. That song is just catchy as hell.
p5210
aVUnbesiegt!
p5211
aVTuris Fratyr - Tote Helden Sagen\u000a\u000aSagas - Mana; Blut im Auge and Unbesiegt.\u000a\u000aRekreatur - In Heiligen Hallen and Der Ewige Sieg\u000a\u000aErdentempel - Every single song is amazing but my favourites are:  ~~Scratch that.~~  I began writing out the album track list.\u000a\u000aI think Erdentempel is definitely on par (perhaps even ahead) of Sagas.  Every song is just so enjoyable and uplifting.  I have been listening to it non-stop for three weeks now.  Although Mana may be my favourite song of all, I think Erdentempel is the most consistently amazing.  \u000a\u000aAnd then I read down the list on this thread and realised there are even more songs I love.
p5212
aVFor Sagas it has to be Verrat. The second half of the song is just pure perfection.\u000a\u000aFor Erdentempel I'd go with Stein Meiner Ahnen, mainly for the chorus.
p5213
aVI'm terribly sorry, but I just love Blut Im Ague the most. I'm sorry for not being original. 
p5214
aVBut I also love Manas. 
p5215
aVAll of them?\u000a\u000aI haven't listened to Erdentempel yet, but so far, there isn't a song I don't like.
p5216
aVI'm surprised that Des Sängers Fluch hasn't been mentioned yet as it's definitely my favourite. Blut Im Auge is the one that made me a fan of Equilibrium but soon I started to appreciate other tracks more.\u000a\u000aI like Erdentempel as a whole and for me Uns'rer Flüten Klang stands out as a very positive surprise. The only thing I'm disappointed about Erdentempel is that it doesn't have as epic instrumental to end the album as Mana and Kurzes Epos are.
p5217
aVHeimwarts, Ruf in den wind, Unbesiegt and Blut im auge.
p5218
aVUns'rer Floten Klang is a brilliant song in my opinion, which is skewed because I myself play the flute. I'm still pretty sure that the flute bit in there was done on keyboard, but I shall not shy from that challenge simply because it's so splendidly catchy.

p5229
aVDefinitely am. I just hope that after Helvetios they won't got back to the Gallic wars... They've kind of overdid that subject. Amazing band though, I can't wait until Origins.  
p5230
aVWell I think part of it is that the Gallic Wars are one thing that we have a lot of surviving material on, and it's a huge part of Gallic history. We have less so in regards to culture and religion, as the Druids regarded the written word as a tool for the weak of mind when it came to the Druidic duties, and so never recorded anything about themselves.
p5231

p5235
aVI would have been but Erdentempel was too good for me to have room :P
p5236
aVI am listening to Eluveitie from last 4 years. I am really excited about their album. Besides, there's always a story in all their albums, so don't just listen them because they sound good. Understand. 
p5237
aVEluveitie SHOULD be a band that I absolutely love, but they aren't and I still don't know why.  I enjoy their music and have three of their albums, but it still doesn't really do it for me.  \u000a\u000aMy favourite Eluveitie songs are the ones with the female vocals as I feel they suit the music the most.  "Inis Mona" is probably the exception.  \u000a\u000aI'll eventually get the new album but I'm not "hyped" for it.  I actually really want to enjoy Eluveitie as I love the folk instruments they use, but they are just one of those bands for me that you try to like a lot but just never seem to excite you.  \u000a\u000aEDIT: Just listened to "King" from the new album.  Yep.  Still doesn't do anything for me.  It just sounds so similar to their other material.  I mean, in some ways you want to hear something familiar as that's why you like a band, but sometimes it's just too similar.  Just doesn't sound like anything new.  Hard to judge an album from one song though.  Who knows, the rest could be amazing.
p5238
aVMaybe it's because they've been my favorite band for so long, but I personally think every album has a very distinct sound. Their guitar work, while not incredibly impressive has been getting alot more interesting over each album. My only complaint was that it seemed like they were using a little less folk on each release, but from the sound of King and the couple live songs I heard from Origins, this one will have the folk I've been missing.
p5239
aVOut of curiosity do you like dark tranquillity? if you don't that might be why. Eluveitie has always been a melodic death metal band that interjects folk instruments and stylings. They don't really approach songwriting like a pure folk band (Evocation is the exception here because its a folk album with no electric instruments)
p5240
aVI think that's part of the problem.  I don't think the metal parts are that interesting and the male vocals are not appealing to me.  I love harsh vocals but his can sound really lame at times.  \u000a\u000aI really love melodic metal.  My favourite folk bans are Finntroll, Equilibrium and Moonsorrow among others.  I've just never been convinced by the melodies of Eluveitie.  Some are really good, but I feel that once you've heard one, you've heard them all.  \u000a\u000aI do however love the folk parts of their songs and as I mentioned I think the female vocals (like in "Slainia's Song") are far more appropriate and interesting.  \u000a\u000a
p5241
aVSo basically you don't like melodic death metal, fair enough.
p5242
aVExcept I do... I enjoy older COB, Kalmah, Amon Amarth etc.  Oh well, thanks for your responses.  \u000a\u000aI should make it clear that out of all the folk metal bands, I still consider Eluvietie a great band, just not one of my favourites. :)

aVArkona has harsh and clean vocals both by Masha.  Eluveitie has occasionaly clean vocals by Anna and more frequent harsh vocals by the frontman dude.  If your friend remembers whether the harsh vocals sounded masculine or feminine that could cut out one band or the other.\u000a\u000aStatistically speaking, it was probably Arkona.  From what I've heard they tend to have a more even ratio of clean and harsh vocals in their songs.\u000a\u000a[Was it this one?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgXlUxDGFvU)
p5257
aVNo, it wasn't Liki Bessmertnykh Bogov.
p5258
aVlol, I don't think a single person I know thought Masha's harsh vocals sounded "feminine" before knowing she was singing them...
p5259
aVYou can't hear it?  They sound much higher and more like her clean singing voice than say Johan's growls.  Typically everyone's growls sound a lot more like their real voices than we tend to realize, mainly because not many singers use both.
p5260
aVI can for sure, but almost everyone upon first listening assumes it is a guy or that they have multiple singers. On comparison with others, it is much easier but I doubt anyone would hear without prior knowledge and just know they are female- and this person barely even knows the music :p
p5261
aVYeah I never got to listen to Arkona without knowing Masha did all the vocals.  Her growls just sound feminine to me.  I much prefer them to Arch Enemy's female growls, which sound to me like she's trying to sound as masculine as possible.
p5262
aVDo you have a rough idea of how long the song was?
p5263
aVNo.
p5264
aVWhich albums did you have by each band at the time?
p5265
aVA couple possibilities from Arkona, could probably do better if I knew exactly what is meant by "chanting" and if you had the entire Arkona discography at the time:\u000aZaklyate; Goi, Rode Goi! acoustic version, Noviy Mir (Shaman cover); Duren' (Svarga cover); Na Svarogovoy Doroge; Arkaim?

VEluveitie is good but not the most creative folk metal, they pretty much just mash gothenburg metal with folk tunes and call it a day. I do love that though... 
p5269
aVEluveitie is good in my opinion. They were one of my first Folk Metal bands. Look up the band Skálmöld (Icelandic band). They're pretty cool and I hear they're making their 3rd album.\u000aEquilibrium also gets much attention in this subreddit! \u000aFinntroll is pretty rad too, if you like Swedish. \u000a\u000aI like to listen to music in other languages so.. Most of my favorite bands sing in foreign languages haha
p5270
aVAw yeah, new Skálmöld!
p5271
aVThe new album will be called *Með vættum*, IIRC. There isn't an official translation of the title or anything, but suggestions were all something like "With spirits." The track names alternate between "In (X season)" and "With (some animal)".\u000a\u000aI'm pretty damn excited for this.
p5272
aVI'm stoked to hear this new album! I've been waiting for a while now. 
p5273
aVI'm not huge on Eluveitie either, but, I do respect them greatly. I think they do a fairly good job.\u000a\u000aFinntroll though. They're the band that got me into folk metal, and their inspiration from Emperor/Black metal made it better for me. They keep it interesting to say the least.\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso! TrollFest, anyone? I just love how goofy their stuff is, and their drummer is pretty intense.
p5274
aVHomework: Ensiferum (old albums) Pretty much great introduction to viking/folk ;) Then is Tyr (my favourite). You got Turisas and others, such as Fintroll and obviously: Korpiklaani - you need to know this one ;)\u000a\u000a\u000aI like very much Hungarian band: Dalriada ;)\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_FJEoXwkNE
p5275
aVOh, I definitely dig Korpiklanni!\u000aI'm very familiar with folk metal bands. I'm just new to reddit in general and this thread. But! It's cool to get people's opinions on their favorite folk metal bands! Thanks!
p5276
aVEluveitie got me into the genre, so obviously i love them, especially their older stuff ("Helvetios" is good though). \u000a\u000aFinntroll (Finland) and Korpiklaani (Finland) are really well known as well as Equilibrium (Germany) and Ensiferum (Finland). A lesser known group is Arkona (Russia). Wintersun (Finland) recently released the album Time I, which is also fantastic (different, but great). \u000a\u000aIf you want something different i can recommend Faun (medieval music, they're from Germany) and Saor Patrol (mostly drums, Scotland). \u000a\u000aEDIT: And welcome to the sub :D
p5277
aVJust found out about Saor Patrol. Really good music.
p5278
aVI am familiar with those bands! I've heard 'of' Faun, but never went out of my way to check it out. I'll do that!\u000a\u000aAlso, thank you!
p5279
aVFaun! You might like schrei es in de wind, has omnos instrumental but I can't remember how similar the German is to the actual omnos lyrics.\u000a\u000aI can't spell German well so forgive the mistakes.
p5280
aVEluveitie's old music is great, I wasn't really into the new album. \u000a\u000aSubway To Sally probably doesn't count ... neither would Saltatio Mortis... no idea on the boundary of "folk metal" category.\u000a\u000aHow about Amorphis? (Also haven't listened to their new stuff.)\u000a\u000aAnd if you need a good laugh, Alestorm. Really, they are great!\u000a\u000aEdit I forgot Orphaned Land.

aVStole the words right out of my mouth.

aVThey are also the ones who introduced me to metal. I got to know them while looking for ONE good song made in Switzerland (as I live there and I quite never hear swiss song). I also went to know Gotthard (a hard rock band also from Switzerland).\u000aSeriously they are in my top 5 with Iron Maiden, Gamma Ray, hammerfall and tellus requiem (a tiny powermetal band I've got to talk with for like an hour after their show in Lausanne)\u000aI'll always remember them at Fribourg !

The history lessons on Batavi were nice and special, not corny or something.
p5446
aVI guess that's true. And folk metal in general has a lot of corny lyrics so it's something I guess you just need to get over if you want to fully enjoy the genre... but in your own language it feels sillier for a reason. And yeah Batavi was pretty good.

Take a look at all this fish" \u000a\u000aWhen a tsumani is about to strike, the sea pulls away and people are amazed, often forgetting that it is a sign of danger to come. \u000a\u000aI love this metaphor. People are often too blindsighted to see the end before it hits them like a tsunami. \u000a\u000aHere's a link to that first interview on my sound cloud: http://m.soundcloud.com/metaloxide/interview-mathias-nygard

aVYeah dude. /r/folkmetal and /r/Wintersun are usually really good about not doing that. But I guess there are a few with fanboy tendencies. \u000a
p5511
aVI really don't like the new Turisas. I didn't like Stand Up and Fight either. It's really not bad music but they've taken such a huge step down since Varangian Way.
p5512
aVI think if you are particularly attached to the first two albums, the later two aren't going to be your cup of tea.  \u000a\u000aI personally think their last two are their best as I felt the first two were a mixed bag and weren't consistently strong.  \u000a\u000aI actually really like "For Your Own Good" as it has a really catchy chorus with some great chord progressions.  The worst song is really only "Run Bhang-Eater, run" because it has some stupid sex section in the middle relegating it to the "never play in public" list.  If you start playing that song out loud, chances are everyone is going to think your watching porn.  
p5513
aVExactly. I discovered them right around the time the Varangian Way came out. That's one of my favorite albums ever and I definitely think change is good but I wanted more of that kind of sound from Stand Up and Fight.

p5517
aVDefinitely check out Dalriada. They don't growl too often, but their music is still very very good.
p5518
aVI looked at Dalriada, and I actually prefer her clean vocals over her growls. I told my friend I thought she sounded kinda froggy, for lack of a better adjective.
p5519
aVI own three of their albums, i've only noticed female growling on Igeret, but their other albums are superb, especially if you like folk metal with gang vocals.

p5543
aVTry Shangren!!
p5544
aVI'm honestly surprised that there isn't more Japanese folk metal. Japanese history and mythology has plenty of source material to draw from. The Warring States Period and the Gempei War would be perfect for samurai themed stuff and there's plenty of pretty metal mythology on top of that. Hell, a god pulled a magic sword our of a 8-headed serpent he defeated by getting it drunk. How fucking metal is that? On top of that, traditional Japanese instruments would fit just as well as Celtic ones. Hell, the [Yoshida Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_CzD0GBD-4) are pretty popular. Why can't I have something like that, just metal?
p5545
aV[Whispered](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Whispered/74805) is a Finnish band that incorporates a lot of Japanese culture, melodic structure, and other stuff into their music.\u000aThey're really symphonic folk metal, but hey, brutal music is brutal. [Thousand Swords](http://youtu.be/382WTnI-RdI) is a good place to start.

VArkona are currently on tour in Russia and this song was recorded in Arkhangelst. Not the best quality, but it's a good sample of what awaits us with their new album Yav.\u000aYav in slavic mythology means the "material" word, where we live now, in contrast to the "immaterial" world Nav and the "law" Prav.\u000a \u000aMasha said in an interview that it will be much different to their other work. She described the sound of the new album as progressive, post black metal-ish with folk elements.\u000aThere won't be any "fun" songs like Yarilo or Stenka Na Stenku because they wouldn't fit into the concept of Yav. They will probably release these songs seperately.\u000a\u000aThe whole recording process was very challenging. Three songs were already recorded by their new drummer [Andrey Ischenko](http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Andrew_Ischenko/7342), who replaced Vlad "Artist" after he left the band for personal reasons.\u000aSome guest musicians will appear on the new album, including Thomas Väänänen (ex-Thyrfing) doing guest vocals, Olli Vänskä (Turisas) on violin, Aleksey "Master Alafern" (Sviatogor,...) on violin and Vika "Vkgoeswild" Yermolyeva on piano.\u000aThere will again be a small monologue spoken by Masha &amp; Sergey's son Radimir.\u000aThe whole album will be about 70 minutes long and includes 9 songs.\u000a\u000a(Sources: [Arkona forum](http://www.rossomahaar.ru/forum/index.php) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/arkonarussia))

aVI just recently read somewhere that the 2014 album will not be the follow up to Evocation I, but the source escaped me as well, sorry for that.

aVNothing's been officially posted as far as I know, but Korpiklaani comes out with albums on a frequent basis and their last release was in August of 2012, so they're past due. It should also be noted that their singer is working on an eponymous side project, but I think that's going to be straight up folk as opposed to folk metal. Speaking of Jonne Järvelä, he recently appeared on Metsatöll's new single, [Lööme Mesti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDIgdwXnRG4), so we can expect something from Metsatöll in 2014.

aVWhy are you buying CD's? Not trying to sound obnoxious or anything,  I'm just curious. 
p5690
aVI consider myself a CD collector. I've been building my collection the last 15 years.  \u000a  \u000aI like having something physical to relate to, and the booklets which contain lyrics and artwork (and sometimes history) are nice to leaf through. As for why I don't collect vinyls... well I started in the dark ages of vinyl when they had just gone out of style and weren't retro yet.
p5691
aVyou can also get a physical copy autographed should you chance to meet any of the parties involved
p5692
aVYup.\u000aHowever, I usually get my concert ticket signed if I meet the artist. Then again the jewel case makes for excellent storage of signed concert tickets
p5693
aVI do the print at home option when I get tickets so I usually don't have a stub as such. When I met Kristian Niemann from Therion I got him to sign my ticket stub. First time I saw Finntroll they did a pre-show meet &amp; greet so I ordered a copy of Nifelvind beforehand and got them all to sign their portraits in the album insert.

aVIt's weak. That's all I can really say about it. When it was released I heard a sample. It took at least 2 years to get around to actually getting the album. Underwhelming at best.

aVUns'rer Flöten Klang wins the entire album for me. The album as a whole is definitely more folky than Rekreatur, both are great but this one was a lot better than I had anticipated.

p5831
aVBracing for downvotes...People kept reposting "Uns'rer Flöten Klang."  I listened at least once, and didn't like it at all, so I don't get all the enthusiasm over *that* song.  Which one of their songs should I try next?
p5832
aVfrom the album? I'd say Wirtshaus Gaudi, Waldschrein, Heavy Chill or Stein Meiner Ahnen. No one said you had to like it.
p5833
aVThanks for the recommendations!  I made my comment primarily because I was curious why people were gravitating towards that song specifically.
p5834
aVI personally love it because it sounds very similar to Irish folk music which is something I listen too all the time. I'm all about those fast and folky melodies, especially the second half of it.
p5835
aVJust a quick suggestion: Write the album artist in the title or atleast in the description. \u000a\u000aI mean, most people get what you meant, but still :D

VI remember how at the time of its release the band, music, concept and entire album was completely ridiculed at the largest metal forum in Norway. I never thought it was that bad, even if it's somewhat gimmicky and has some truly cringeworthy vocal performances here and there.\u000a\u000aPersonally I think [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHV-L5aGMF4) is far better, and a lot more folky.

p5854
aVThat's a great song. I think The Court of Jarislief is my favorite of the album. The fiddle riffing is insane.
p5855
aVAh, I remember debating paying the extra couple bucks for the whole album if it only gave me one song... Totally worth it.   \u000aAlso, I got to go to Istanbul, and listened to that almost non-stop.

VI was able to get myself to paganfest this year. Everyone there was amazing! Ensiferum, Heidvolk, trollfrest, Tyr, and hellsot brought it. I also managed to see wintersun during the summer. Those were probably the best tours that I came across (missed Finntroll due to school).\u000a\u000aProbably the biggest disappointment I had with an album was Turisas2013. I really didn't enjoy most of the songs. BUT, I really enjoy Tyr's new album! With Eluveitie's album coming in maybe 2014 along with Time II, 2013 was an alright year for folk metal, but I look forward to a few more tours this next coming year hopefully!
p5886
aVI got lucky and got to see them all in Hollywood earlier this year when I just happened to be in that town. Tyr was awesome live IMO, can't wait to see them on their upcoming tour.
p5887
aVYou're a lucky guy. I've seen Ensiferum, Heidevolk and Týr already but I've yet to see Trollfest, which are definitely my favourite from all of the mentioned.\u000a\u000aI agree with the disappointment. Turisas2013 is *alright* album, after few listens, but nothing great really. Probably their worst so far.
p5888
aVTrollfest is pretty amazing live. I don't particularly like their music and still had a blast both times I saw them this year (Paganfest and when they opened for Alestorm).
p5889
aVHeidevolk is also having a new album next year, so 2014 is supposed to become a good year for folk metal!
p5890
aVTurisas2013 - huge disappointment. Concluded it would be a fun time live, but I can't stand listening through the album (With the exception of the track "Greek Fire").\u000a\u000a\u000aA fair split between Finntroll's *Blodsvept* and Tyr's *Valkryja*. Both were fun, enjoyable album's to listen to.\u000a\u000a\u000aI've been listening to *Fejd* and *Sig:Ar:Tyr*, both excellent folk styled bands that bring something interesting to the table. Fejd is more folky than metal, but is still really neat, and Sig:Ar:Tyr is more blackened epic folk, which sounds really awesome.\u000a\u000aWent to Paganfest,  saw Finntroll and saw Wintersun. Paganfest was amazing - even more so this year, every band was perfect.\u000a\u000aFinntroll was a riot of a time - almost went to see them again, but didn't have the time.\u000a\u000aWintersun was a blinding, reverberating mosh of colour and sound... and it was amazing. Absolutely amazing. 10/10 \u000a
p5891
aVMy biggest disappointment was actually *Blodsvept*. I love Finntroll and saw them live this year. The live show was amazing as always. But the newest album felt lacking. I can't quite say what it was but it feels a bit tired.
p5892
aVThe only folk metal album I got this year was Equilibrium's Waldschrein EP and it was fucking amazing. 
p5893
aVThough underwhelming when you consider only 1 song was new...  Waldschrein is a great song but the EP was rather lackluster.  \u000a\u000aThe Skyrim cover had previously been posted by Equilibirum's guitarist on Youtube ages ago just as a fun thing he'd whipped up.  I thought the album one would be different, but it was exact same just looped twice.  \u000a\u000aZwergenhammer has some nice parts but isn't amazing like Equilibirum's newer stuff and Der Sturm was never a song I particularly liked anyway, so redoing it held no interest for me.  \u000a\u000aI mean Waldschrein was so good that it makes up for the inadequacy of the other songs and I'm definitely excited for the new album.
p5894
aVhey, to each their own. I'm all about the folky melodies so Zwergenhammer was great, I've always loved the Skyrim theme so it was impossible to not like it, Der Sturm was one of my favorites off their first album and Waldschrein got me really excited for their new album. I feel and sound like a bit of a Fanboy, but I really did like the EP.
p5895
aVWell that's the thing... I think Zwergenhammer over all has a weaker folk feel than their newer Sagas+ material.  \u000a\u000aThe Skyrim theme is great, just disappointing when I realised I'd already heard it before and that they hadn't done anything new to it.  
p5896
aVBiggest disappointment - I'd say Turisas2013 as well. I didn't really expect much as I''ve never been a big fan, but as they were playing on Paganfest and I got to see them for the first time I decided to give them a chance. Sadly they couldn't change my mind.\u000a\u000aBest album - probably Falkenbach's Asa or Týr's Valkyrja. But my actual favorite is Arkona's live album, because it is basically a best of with newly arranged songs including choir and strings. Best part is - it's 3CDs with 36 songs and over 3h playtime.\u000a\u000aNew bands - I discover new bands on an almost daily basis, but one I especially started to like is the polish band Stworz, or at least their 2010 album.\u000a\u000aBands I saw live - a lot. Seriously, I've been to so many shows and festival this year as never before (mostly black and folk metal). Here are the folk metal bands I've seen: Korpiklaani 2x, Metsatöll, Avven, Niburta, Wolfchant 2x, Arkona 2x (+3x in December), Thyrfing, Bornholm, Alestorm 2x, Varg, Agalloch, Heathen Foray 3x, Finsterforst, Obscurity, Eluveitie, Ensiferum 2x, Orphaned Land 2x, Saltatio Mortis, Feuerschwanz, Solstafir, Haggard, Odraedir, Knaat 2x, Týr, Finntroll 2x, Equilibrium, Suidakra, Turisas, Frosttide, In Extremo.\u000a\u000aMy favorite shows/festivals were definitely Heidenfest (because I had the chance to spend some time with Arkona) as well as Runen der Nacht (a new small festival in Upper Austria - Finsterforst were absolutely brilliant live!). Summer Breeze was awesome as well (again, met Arkona:), Paganfest also never disappoints. The Finntroll headline show probably was a small highlight for me, I never really got into their albums but they were a blast live. And now I'm especially looking forward to the three Arkona+Therion shows in December (yea, I'm kind of a freak).
p5897
aV1. It has to be Bloodsvept. Even though it was a good album, it was quite underwhelming in my opinion.\u000a2. Not sure\u000a3. Vallorch, Wolfchant, Waylander\u000a5. N/A
p5898
aVI went to Paganfest this year. Wasn't a huge fan of the line up this year but I really liked Heidvolk. 
p5899
aVOrphaned Land's *All Is One* was my greatest disappointment of 2013, along with Turisas2013.
p5900
aVBiggest disappointment? I listened to maybe two songs off Turisas2013 and decided that was the end of that. But I don't know if it was necessarily a disappointment because after the steaming pile of shit that was 'Stand Up and Fight', I didn't have any hopes for the album being better than a 2/10.\u000a\u000aAs far as 'best album', I'm probably going to go with Tyr's 'Valkyrja' as well. This was a relatively down year for folk metal though. Manegarm, Wolfchant, and Minotaurus all came out with pretty terrible albums too :-(\u000a\u000aHaven't discovered a ton of new bands this year; guess I'm falling off.\u000a\u000aRelatively down year in shows for me as well. Live bands I saw this year:\u000a\u000a* Arkona (2x)\u000a* Die Apokalyptischen Reiter\u000a* Ensiferum (3x)\u000a* Finntroll\u000a* Heidevolk (3x)\u000a* Helsott\u000a* Metsatoll\u000a* Subway to Sally\u000a* Trollfest\u000a* Turisas (2x)\u000a* Tyr (4x)\u000a\u000aEveryone was pretty solid, less Trollfest and Turisas. I'll be avoiding them if I can in the future.

aVOh, I'll travel if I must. I won't miss this show.
p5994
aVGood on ya. It can drive me absolutely wild when people complain that they will have to drive/train/bus a few hours, or catch a short cheap flight, for a tour. If only I had that option. I've mates who end up flying over to Australia a couple of times a year just for a gig, and even then we are still limited to what bands manage to get that far. You lot have it lucky.
p5995
aVIt's difficult for me to get time off work. That's my biggest hurdle. I don't care about driving a bunch and I can afford the tickets/gas money. Even if I don't have anyone to go with, I don't mind shows alone.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I hope you get a chance to see them soon.
p5996
aVYeah, Eluveitie are big enough now that I would expect them to do an Asia/Oceania tour sooner or later. Especially if they come in support of a new acoustic album: that would be perfect as I'm not really feeling a lot of their newer metal stuff. Either way I would be booking leave and buying my ticket ASAP.

aVTyr and Metsatöll are awesome, but... what I wouldn't give for the supporting lineup to be switched between continents :x
p6004
aVWhat I'd love would be Tyr headlining with Arkona and Skalmold supporting.  And Metsatoll too.  Why is all the support better than the headliner?
p6005
aV*cough* Arkona headlining
p6006
aVWhatever the combination, I'm sure everyone has a different opinion on who should be where in the set.\u000a\u000aEdit: why doesn't Tyr headline over Skalmold, and then Arkona headline a second tour over Metsatoll.  Then Eluveitie can get Dalriada (the better version of Eluveitie).
p6007
aVI'm so excited, I missed seeing Tyr a few months ago and kicked myself for it. I can't wait to see Eluveitie, I've heard from friends that they're amazing live.

aVAmazing tour I only went for Finntroll in Ottawa and Metsatöll blew it up. Can't wait to see them again in October. The 2 hour drive is worth it. 
p6011
aVMore than anything I'm just happy to see Calgary getting decent shows... there was a time one would have to drive to Edmonton to see anything heavier than Nickleback... now in the last 8 months I've seen Finntroll with Metsatoll, Blackguard and a local folk metal band then Korpiklaani with Turisas, Chthonic, Varg and Winterhymn\u000a\u000amind = blown

VAnyone else think the vocals sound quite odd at times?  Like some sort of unintentional vibrato "bleeting?"\u000a\u000aI mean obviously this reminds me of Alestorm, but the thing is, Alestorm isn't that original, just massively fun.  (I absolutely love how tongue in cheek they are: they know their music is a thematic joke!)  So when you take something that sounds like something that wasn't that unique to begin with, it ends up not being that impressive.\u000a\u000aThe question to ask is: why would I listen to this band over Alestorm or Swashbuckled?\u000a\u000aThere are decent instrumental ideas here, but the vocals aren't very good at it seems that his odd vibrato is his "signature" technique so if you don't like it, it's going to ruin all the other songs too.
p6053
aVI loved your comment but I do enjoy the interesting vocal technique and would prefer these guys over Alestorm and Swashbuckled. One thing I have learned about music is not to make it a competition.

VIt's most definitely power metal.  What are the folk metal influences that you think are present in this song?  \u000a\u000aListening to any other song of theirs confirms that it is power metal.  I mean the name alone is one of those stereotypical power metal idioms.  \u000a\u000aI personally don't think using a church organ synth qualifies anything as "Medieval" or "Folk."  It's much more in line with the gothic/theatrical style of metal, which is confirmed by their lyrical content.  Their "uniqueness" comes from their vocal layering to create the choral effects, but I believe that's more part of the theatrical nature of their music.  Put crudely, it's basically the whole "Evil-church" image in line with bands like Ghost however I think Powerwolf is far more tongue-in-cheek. (I mean, I can't imagine "Sanctified with Dynamite" being anything more than a fun power metal romp with heavy riffs.)\u000a\u000aEDIT: Just to confirm; every online source labels them "Power Metal."  
p6083
aVGenre argument aside (and it shouldn't be an argument -- it's very definitively power metal) -- it still scares me how many people don't realize Powerwolf is a complete joke.\u000a\u000aNo one remembers them before they were Powerwolf, eh? They were a stoner rock group called Red Aim. They've always done this "joke band" thing. I *think* I still might have some of their stuff somewhere on an old thumb drive or something -- I'll have to search for it this weekend.
p6084
aVDefinitely agree.  The song titles alone should reveal how over-the-top and cheesy they are.  To some extent even Alestorm is a "joke band."  They even make fun of their lack of lyrical diversity in the song "Scraping the Barrel" with the verse:\u000a\u000a*You may think you've heard all this music before\u000aThat "Running Wild" did it back in.84\u000aBut times are a changin' and we don't give a damn\u000aSo if you don't like it, go start your own band\u000aMany have told us that we can't go on\u000aThat one day we'll run out of lyrics for songs\u000aBut when the time comes to write album four\u000aWe'll scrape out the barrel once more*\u000a\u000aI disagree with the OP that Powerwolf's image is "folk inspired" in any way.  It is definitely clerical (aka "Evil Church" image) and gothic, taking on the typical Catholic Priestly gowns.  The video you linked to takes place in a church with the lead singer singing in the confessional.  \u000a\u000aI would also link vampires and werewolves with the occult and gothic, not folk.
p6085
aVLike I said, I would put it under folk "for lack of anything closer." It obviously doesn't sound like a typical folk metal band, but from the band's costumes, their lyrics (a lot about werewolves from what I gather), and their image in general they didn't seem to fit in with other genres of metal.
p6086
aVProbably more along the lines of power metal, but I definitely see your point, there are folk or medieval themes in there.

aVFor the longest time I always compared *Rekreatur* to *Sagas*, so I didn't listen to it too much, since Sagas is pretty much perfect.  I finally decided to just sit down and listen to the whole thing all the way through, (which I'd done before, but this time I payed really close attention) and my god.  Some of this stuff I like *more* than Sagas.  That part at around 3:50 is one of the catchiest things I've ever heard!

They combine female and male vocals, but their later albums have a strong focus on the female voice.  \u000a\u000aTwo good examples:\u000a\u000a[Buccaneer's Inn (Sorry for weird game footage; no one has uploaded the album version of the song)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufoy2NXAIDQ)\u000a\u000a[Sons of Riddermark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THLQt8kNiX0)\u000a\u000aTheir *Sword's Song* album is really good, but there are some great songs on their later albums too.  \u000a\u000a\u000aIf you enjoy folk music that isn't metal, I'd recommend checking out Faun.  They use a lot of folk instruments and have lovely female vocals.\u000a\u000a[Mit Dem Wind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSxmfNS3NiY)\u000a\u000aHope this helps.  I think I have very similar musical tastes to you :)
p6134
aVI cannot echo Battlelore enough. They do a good job of balancing their music, the vocals, especially. Plus, a good deal of their material is based on Tolkienian lore. Narn i Chîn Húrin is my favorite legend of his, probably in all modern fiction, and I was delighted when I found *Doombound*  (a concept album centering on the tale)...so, yeah, good suggestion!!\u000a\u000a*"Master of Doom, by Doom mastered."*
p6135
aVI was just going to say Faun! Go listen to Schrei es in die Winde. You'll recognize part of it immediately.\u000a\u000aAlso, listen to Faun's earlier stuff, their former singer Elisabeth Pawelke is great! (She has her own solo stuff since she left Faun. Also plays hurdy gurdy. Check out El Rey de Francia. Not folk metal but still awesome.)\u000a\u000a\u000aSuidakra has a song entirely sung by a woman called Birog's Oath. I'm not sure about the rest of their songs.\u000a\u000a\u000aForget any spelling errors, I just woke up. And I'm out of the serious folk metal loop, sorry for lack of that. I listen to more faun and "medieval" stuff. \u000a\u000a\u000aP.s. check out Anna's music outside of Eluveitie. Her voice is amazing.
p6136
aVI was actually listening to Faun's "Von den Elben" album on the way to work today, and this was the first thing I thought of seeing the OPs question.  I love the more upbeat Faun songs, but I get a little tired of the slower ballads...especially in the morning on the way to work.
p6137
aVOh yeah, the ballads are very slow. Von den Elben  is a great album. I sometimes nod off on the ballads when I'm at my house and super exhausted. I don't drive but I have to look out for my bus stop.
p6138
aVThey're not quite as heavy, but I like everything I've heard from Grai.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yicTUvDVTHA\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gMCxCI9IBw\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elhPFPxLOEA

aV\u000a\u000aThis likely won't be much help, but http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Eluveitie/13991?showMoreSimilar=1#Similar_artists is one way to find more bands. However, it's hard to tell what the vocal quality is from that list. While I wish I could recommend [Arkona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaP1wDvkA6E) to you the majority of Masha Scream's singing is the *opposite* of what you want (that is the only clean song I could find, and I'm not sure it qualifies). \u000a\u000aI'll recommend [Turisas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFBIr3Vx16w) to you; they fit what you're looking for besides the fact that it's a male singer. \u000a\u000aYou may have luck dropping the "metal" and going for straight folk to find clean vocals with themes like Eluveitie. For example [Baltimore Consort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1z7kLzpRVA) does very traditional songs with an amazing female lead, Custer LaRue. (She hasn't sung for them for a while, I don't know who is singing for them now, but there's 5-6 CDs released with her on them. Many of the songs don't have vocals unfortunately). \u000a\u000aThere's a lot of Celtic Folk singers that may also have what you're looking for. [Random example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDdi6bn06bo). \u000a\u000a
p6140
aVYeah, Arkona are excellent but mostly harsh.  About opposite of that is Dalriada (used to be Echo of Dalriada).  Female fronted, but mostly clean with some harsh.  Check out:\u000a\u000a* [Napisten Hava](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wFlohv_VBo)\u000a* [Hajdútánc](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F7b4skyUy4)\u000a* [Virrasztó](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ15tVKPTHY)

VI think the first folk metal band I ever heard was Korpiklaani, a lot of years ago. My friends from highschool at the time were showing the video to everyone, laughing at it (in a negative way, none of them liked metal). Someone showed it to me and I was like 'umm, that's badass'. I'm pretty sure I was mostly into prog/power metal at the time, mostly Dream Theater and Blind Guardian.\u000a\u000aI don't listen to Korpiklaani basically ever nowadays, but I quickly discovered Ensiferum, Wintersun, Tyr, Finntroll, and others after that.

aVI live in the UK and I've only got like 3 friends who like it and they live in a different city. :(\u000a\u000aEveryone in London just listens to djent all day. 
p6155
aVHaha I love djent, and oddly enough, there aren't many folks around here who like that either. I feel your pain though. I'm surrounded by people who either listen to country or hip hop. 
p6156
aVI live in the UK, none of my friends are really into metal at all, though some listen to it from time to time. But those that listen to metal from time to time can bare lamb of god as the heaviest band in existence so getting them into folk metal will never happen, no matter how much I try.
p6157
aVWhen I was 11 and had to take sewing class at school a guy from another class asked me what kind of music I liked, and at the time as I barely knew about sub-genres I replied with "heavy metal", then he asked me what kinds of heavy metal I liked. Of course, I didn't know about different sub-genres so he just told me a few (death, black, folk, doom, white). Folk music was my second favourite music genre right after metal, so folk metal sounded like a best of both worlds type thing. When I got home I searched "folk metal" on YouTube, and I came across a few bands including Korpiklaani and Finntroll, now they're two of my top 10 bands of all time.
p6158
aVI went to a DragonForce concert in Atlanta in 2008. Turisas was one of the opening acts. At first I didn't understand what they were trying to convey, then I looked them up about a week later. They have been my favorite band since and I haven't missed an opportunity to see them live in Atlanta.  
p6159
aVThey headlined on that tour for the new Orleans show! Dragon force wasn't there and I was happy and it was amazing! I have the set list framed on my dresser still.
p6160
aVLong story short: Fuck yeah, vikings!
p6161
aVThe band that I listened to that got me into metal was Amon Amarth. You can kinda guess what happened from there. Heard about Ensiferum and the rest is history
p6162
aVI went to Paganfest III because Alestorm was playing. I left in love with Arkona.
p6163
aVI got into folk metal my first or second year of college. I was working in a tire and lube place at Walmart, changing oil and tires and stuff. At the time, I listened to some progressive metal, death metal, and I think a lot of System of a Down, which has always been my favorite band. So, this guy came in for an oil change, rock and roll lookin' dude, so I happened to be the one to pull his car into the shop. As I pulled it in, his radio was blasting some metal, the likes of which I had never head before. It was heavy, fast, a lot of synth, and very melodic. I turned it down a bit, but not all the way. I immediately became interested in the sound, but put it out of my mind until I got back in the car to pull it out of the shop. This time, I ejected the CD to see what it was. It was Wintersun's self-titled album. I downloaded the album when I got home (I have since purchased it), and I listened to that heavily for the next few weeks. This was before I used Pandora, Reddit, so I didn't have any way to find more music like it, as I didn't even know what genre it is. After a few weeks, I was talking about Wintersun in class with this kid who was into shitty obscure punk that sounds like speaker vomit, and this other kid overheard and told me if I liked Wintersun, I should definitely check out Ensiferum. I have no idea how I remembered that name until I got home, but when I did, I looked them up and my mind exploded. I went on wikipedia and started looking up related bands and now I'm a pretty big fan of the genre and I'm still discovering more. None of my friends are really into it, but I can drag them to a show once in a while. I rarely see shows living in upstate NY. Ensiferum came here a couple years ago, as well as Tyr, and those were amazing. How I got into Tyr is another story altogether, but they are a favorite of mine. I also saw Wintersun around the same time, which had been a dream of mine since I first heard them. Incidentally, they were not headlining that night, and I we almost left after they finished, as I had to work in the morning, but we decided to give the headliner a chance for a song or two. Ended up staying for the entire show. The headliner was Eluvietie, who I had not heard of, but after their first song I was blown away. They played through an entire album and it was spectacular. Every time he went from growling straight to a tin flute solo, I both laughed and cheered. Only folk metal can offer that awesome of a show.
p6164
aV&gt; I rarely see shows living in upstate NY.  \u000a\u000aTell me about it; I go to school upstate, and none of the bands I like ever come closer than NYC.
p6165
aVYeah it sucks. Every once in a while they'll come to Buffalo or Rochester, where I think they're gaining a following. I can't afford to miss those shows. All in all, we don't get much up here. And when we do, it's on a fucking Monday or Tuesday night so they can be in NYC by Friday.
p6166
aVWell the worst part is that I don't have a car at school, and I don't really know any other folk metal fans there. I live in New England, too, which means I miss out on anyone that comes to Worcester in the fall, which is everyone.
p6167
aVIt's tough finding fellow fans. I assume you reside at a university at the moment. I almost guarantee there are fans there, it's just that in my experience, those individuals are somewhat introverted, so they're tough to find. You'll never hear them blasting it with their windows down, or involved in academic or many social gatherings.\u000a\u000aAs with any niche interest that may not seem to have much of a local presence, it could be a "If you build it, they will come" scenario. Someone needs to organize some forum for fans to meet. Someone can book a classroom or small auditorium for a folk metal appreciation night or something. Most colleges give students the ability to organize all sorts of things if students think to ask. I've seen students do this for things like Dragonball Z, Nerf, old movies, whatever. And if there's any food there, that will be a huge plus. Campus residents are always hungry.
p6168
aV2001 -- Ensiferum.\u000a\u000aHeard 'Hero in a Dream' while on vacation at a family friend's house that had this new-fangled "metal channel" on their television (some digital music channel). It was before the album had even been released and the station was playing a bunch of promo tracks.\u000a\u000aLoved the song. Went home and immediately bought the album -- my first ever online purchase as well -- directly from Spinefarm (or Spikefarm, whatever it was) and received it without knowing anything about the band. Haven't looked back since.
p6169
aVI found this streaming metal radio station in college around 2006 (because I couldn't stand the radio anymore), and I heard all these crazy songs I've never heard before. Some were just Iron Maiden and Judas Priest songs they don't play on the radio, but then I heard "The Bard's Song" - Blind Guardian, and I was hooked. I went to youtube and found a bunch of their stuff, and then found bands like Tyr and Korpiklaani. I went to a Blind Guardian concert in 2006, and from there discovered Leaves' Eyes. Then I went to a Tyr concert in 2008 (I think, their first time in the US), and discovered Turisas and Eluveitie. From there, just following youtube and Pandora, I've had more than enough new music to keep me interested and away from the radio.
p6170
aVI had a friend who I was playing some Halo:Reach with and he mentioned Alestorm, after he described I felt I had to look it up and then after I fell in love with that I slowly found Tyr, Eluvietie, Ensiferum, Wintersun and have an ever growing list of bands I find through this sub and spotify. Before Alestorm though I listened to mostly metalcore and hard rock now Power and Folk metal are my bread and butter with a sprinkling of other various metal genres.
p6171
aVI was hoping to go to see Dragonforce so I looked up the opening act (Turisas). I never got to go to the concert, but Turisas really sucked me in with Battle Metal.
p6172
aVFunny story, I was at Ozzfest years ago, long before I heard any folk metal. Dragonforce was opening on the main stage to a thin audience. I was at the second stage watching some thrash metal band, so I only faintly heard them. Years later I discovered Dragonforce and thought, shit I could have seen them live...\u000a\u000aAlso, thanks for pointing out Turisas. I've seen the name but never checked them out. Now I will.
p6173
aVMy metal journey started when my older brother introduced me to Spellblast.  Before I was listening to Chevelle and Avenged Sevenfold.  I started listening to them and loved what I heard.  My interests lead me to more power/folk as I'm not a big fan of the majority of vocals being harsh.  This lead me to Elvenking, Kiuas (mainly power, but just the right amount of folk) and then Korpiklaani, Týr, Wintersun, Skyclad, etc.\u000a\u000aMy favorite band I discovered is Kiuas, and I am currently really into Dalriada.  So, yeah.  I'm not your typical folk metal listener, but if you like more melodic vocals to go with your folk metal, in addition to what I've mentioned check out Boisson Divine, Falconer, Heidevolk, Metsatöll, and Vexillum.
p6174
aVWhatever happened to Kiuas? I only heard one song by them but it was really good.
p6175
aVBroke up last year, sadly...
p6176
aVMan that sucks. 
p6177
aVI remember when I thought Finntroll was 'too heavy'....Good times.
p6178
aVYou too? I couldn't get into them (or amon amarth) for a good while. Acquired tastes for sure.
p6179
aV2007- a friend of mine showed me Drudkh, Temnozor and Eluveitie. Back then I was more into grunge and alternative rock (Nirvana, etc), and didn't really care for the aggressive vocals often used in metal, but gradually Drudkh won me over. Found Arkona from Temnozor's song of the same name and was blown away by Masha; Eluveitie's Slania was released. I was hooked.
p6180
aVBack in the MySpace days, a buddy of mine had a Fintroll song (Trollhammaren) on his profile, it would automatically start playing every time you loaded his page. I was more into metalcore/hardcore/gindcore at the time, but I was really captivated by the melodies in the song. A few years later, I had German class in college with a kid who wore a Finntroll shirt. I started talking to him about folk metal, he showed me Ensiferum/Wintersun, and the rest was history. You're the man, Roy! 
p6181
aVI knew a guy named Stew who used to do live shows on BlogTv. The dude was a total badass viking loving metal head and I decided to ask him about the music he had playing when he'd do a show. I was just beginning to discover a bit of metal music and was just attracted to what I heard. He showed me songs from a bunch of bands, half I don't remember. So then I started listening gradually to bands like; Amon Amarth, Finntroll, Turisas, Alestorm, etc. Being a massive fan of vikings and their culture it was easy to fall in love. Now to just find a friend that shares my interest in music...
p6182
aVDo you remember Stew's username on Blogtv?
p6183
aVStewGuitarFest ;P
p6184
aVMust have hung out in different circles on Blog. I have most of my folk metal music from listening to Choppers Metal.
p6185
aVYeah most of my time was spent in cartoon rooms. xD
p6186
aVBack in the early 90s I discovered Unleashed (my all time favorite band of any genre, mostly based on their Victory album and earlier), which taught me that there were bands that had Viking and Norse Mythology themes.  \u000a\u000aSome time shortly thereafter I learned of Einherjer (specifically Dragons of the North) and that officially put Viking and Folk Metal on my radar.  \u000a\u000aIn addition, a wide array of other bands, including the likes of Otyg, Månegarm, Amon Amarth, Finntroll, and early Vintersorg (first 3) solidified the general interest in Folk Metal, Viking Metal, and Viking Death Metal.
p6187
aVI had a Gamma Ray pandora station which had a few folk metal songs. Namely Vodka by Korpiklaani and Dead Man's Reel by SuidAkrA. That was my introduction and i just kept searching a little bit after hearing those. But I'd say my REAL introduction was Blut Im Auge by Equilibrium. \u000a\u000aI was playing guitar in my basement one summer and just hopping from genre/band to genre/band on a tab website. I saw the title and found it interesting so I clicked it. I loved the sound that came out even though it was just [a shitty sounding guitar pro tab](http://www.songsterr.com/a/wsa/equilibrium-blut-im-auge-tab-s23609t0) but I looked up the real song and HATED it. I couldn't get past the vocals. I could only do clean at this time. but the melody was so awesome that I kept listening to it until I liked it. the rest is history.
p6188
aVI think I saw Trollhammaren in youtube suggestions while listening to some Kamelot or something back in 2008 or 2009. From there I really got into Finntroll and Eluveitie, met a friend who introduced me to Tyr, Ensiferum, Turisas, Falkenbach, and fell in love with the genre. Since then I've moved on a bit though, mostly to atmospheric/epic black.\u000a
p6189
aVI think my first introduction to folk metal was borrowing Turisas CD (the varangian way) from library. I didn't really think of it as folk metal at the time, just nice viking themed power metal (and i still think that most of Turisas songs are closer to PM than FM, but that's just me...)\u000a\u000aMy next introduction was downloading randomly found Korpiklaani with DC++ (lol, p2p is so damn unreliable these days... torrents are much easier to use and find what you're looking for). I saw their name in a music folder and downloaded and fell in love...\u000a\u000aI can't really say when i began actively listening and seeking more folk metal, but last year i had a big surge, especially joining this sub.
p6190
aVIt began when I was in 8th grade (2012) when I was researching norse paganism as I was interested in the subject. The song that was playing over the video was "Your Gaulish War" by Eluveitie. It first blew me away from the opening mandolin straight to the flutes+guitars. The thing that held me back however was that I wasn't a fan of growling vocals (I grew up listening to bands that didn't use growling vocals i.e. Led Zeppilin, The Who, and U2). I grew up with Lord of the Rings and the soundtrack was amazing and Folk metal was that mixed with LZ. But after listening to more Eluveitie songs, I had gotten used to growls and I felt its passion. Folk metal incorporates elegance, and peacefulness, with sheer energy of which I had never heard before. I then found Arkona, then Krampus, then Finntroll, and many others. Krampus especially blew me away with their album "Survival of the Fittest" as the lyrics were environmental and very critical of modern society. As I am very critical of modern society and my love of nature, I felt like this was for me. I've now found 34 Folk metal bands and that number keeps on growing. Now Finntroll and Eluveitie are tied for my favorite band. I would love to go to a concert but high school is my number one priority right now and the bands never come through my area of northern New Jersey, But it would be great and extraordinary to go see one. 
p6191
aVCant remember exactly, but I think the first folkmetal album I heard was Jaktens Tid, then I quickly moved on to Eluveitie.
p6192
aVBack in 2007 I was sitting in a hot tub in Richmond British Colombia when one of my friends put on "trollhammaren" by finntroll\u000aAnd that did it, set me on a path I will never regret...\u000aStarted a band that day and have toured and played multiple shows with finntroll and with other well established folk metal acts....\u000a
p6193
aVI downloaded a few .mp3s of Finntroll and Korpilaani on SoulSeek back in 2005 or something.
p6194
aVMy life was a fuzzy blur then.  (I was really sick)  but I remember Eluveitie. Not sure if they were the first but I remember them the most. They also survived as one of the few bands I still listen to from that time in my life.\u000a\u000aBonus: I have inis mona as the ringtone on my old phone,  because I would never hear it ring if it wasn't "growling". Scares people but I secretly wish someone would be all "Eluveitie!"\u000a\u000aI doubt anyone is going to be yelling "Arkona!" at my new phone though. \u000a\u000aEdit... I was listening to Finntroll, Korpiklaani (spelling fail), Turisas... at that time too.
p6195
aVThe first FM song I heard was Ensiferum's "Little Dreamer," and I was instantly hooked. \u000a\u000aI always had a penchant for Norse mythology, Norse History (Vikings, etc) and whatnot, and I *love* the melodies in Folk Metal. Something about it just makes me happy. 
p6196
aVNot really folk metal but my first introduction to something like it was Amon Amarth. My friend showed me them and I started checking out bands that were in the same vain as them.
p6197
aVIt was either Korpiklaani or Ensiferum, I can't quite remember which I'd heard first, it was a long time ago. But once I discovered Skyclad I fell in love with the genre fully. Skyclad are still one of my favourite bands and my favorite folk metal band. \u000a\u000aAlso, Tyr was one of the first folk metal bands I heard, back when they had only released two albums and hardly anyone knew about them. I stumbled upon The Wild Rover on Metalstorm radio. I've been a fan of Tyr ever since.    
p6198
aVLong time NWOBHM and Powermetal fan. Listening to a metal station on Live365 and heard Pagan Purity by Elvenking (from when they weren't shit). Was hooked after that.

asV(New Release) Eluveitie - The Call of the Mountains (Multilanguage)
p6214
(lp6215
VThis band is getting more and more like pop music with each new album. I'm looking forward for an Evocation II though, they do the pure folk thing really well.
p6216
aVHonestly I don't mind this direction. I enjoy their older stuff, but this is pretty amazing too, in a different way.
p6217
aVHell, I'm still going to listen to the album; Eluveitie has a tendency to release some of their weakest songs (in my opinion) as singles.
p6218
aVI agree, I was pretty worried about Helvetios when A Rose For Epona was the first thing they released from it. Gladly, the rest of the album was the Eluveitie I loved and that song grew on me. It looks like Origins is gonna be the same way, the other single they released from it is one of the heaviest songs they've done.
p6219
aVYeah? I though of especially Helvetios being more and more towards the metal part of the band.
p6220
aVHelvetios was definitely more on the lines of metalcore than their previous work, but the album relied a lot of techniques similar to that of pop music.  Relying heavily on catchy choruses and repetitive verses was a common theme across the album.  It was also a lot more vocal-focused than previous albums.  It's still had some great songs, and I'm not entirely anti-pop either. Slania, for the most part, was the album that had the most metal element in my opinion, and even that had a lot of pop structures.  It kind of fits since they're going for a 'new age' sound, but, as a musician, I'm a huge fan of the more dynamic structure such as a lot of Ensiferum's longer songs.  I hope I've not gone too in depth and managed to cover an acceptable response for you!
p6221
aVWell if Slania had Pop elements I don't care because it is my favourite Eluveitie album.
p6222
aVSame haha, like I said, still good music!
p6223
aVI like it. Not as heavy as their other stuff, but still a good track.

aVFolk Rock

aVEluveitie is certainly on the line. [The lead single from their new album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AawUSC6hGY) is a lot more metal than this one.
p6229
aVThe majority of their songs are metal. Their last album only had one "Folk Rock" song.
p6230
aVThey pretty much just take folk and branch off in all directions from there. Stuff like Havoc and Nil are undeniably metal, while stuff like Memento and Jezaig verge on pure folk.  \u000a[Havoc](http://i.imgur.com/LLKQH2w.jpg)  \u000a[Nil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnnsm2O88s4)  \u000aAnd then stuff like  \u000a[Memento](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xhu10q4xvM)  \u000a[Jezaig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIVTnQnGI6w) (has guitar/drum backing, but super folksy songwriting and overall sound)
p6231
aVWhile I like the song and always like the female vocals, it's pretty similar to a lot of there other stuff.  They could just as easily transition into the chorus from "A Rose for Epona" or many other songs so they really aren't expanding their musical style much... \u000a\u000aThe folk instruments are great though.

p6250
aVI've only recently read the reviews on the Metal Archives and although they generally share the same opinion as myself, I find the overly-harsh reviews drag down an album's rating.\u000a\u000aCase in point: Summoning.  As an atmospheric black metal band, you can expect a lot of things from any of their releases.  A hell of a lot of reverb, lots of keys and LONG songs.  \u000a\u000aSome idiot wrote a review to one of their albums giving it a low score because "there is too my synth; this isn't black metal, and the songs are too long."  Like really?  If you were a fan of Summoning or even listened to one album, you'd KNOW that that's EXACTLY what to expect.  \u000a\u000aIt seems like many people listen to albums of genres they don't like and just decide "this is shit, better write a review."  \u000a\u000aI've just found other review sites more consistent and in-line with my tastes than the Metal Archive where anyone can submit a review.

aVExactly my thoughts! Awesome EP but wished the vocals were louder! All and all sounds awesome! Keep up the great work!
p6280
aVThe whole Ep sounds really good. I put it on my Bandcamp wishlist.\u000a\u000aWhat would you say were your influences? Golden Spirit reminds me of Hollenthon. Are you familiar with them?
p6281
aVI'm not. But I will definitely check them out. Our influences vary a bit. The singer and the other guitarist and I all came from an extreme metal background. But we all felt like doing something different. So this happened. The violinist is classically trained and listens to pretty much everything, but makes he's own electronic music. So the influences are from everywhere. But we tried to keep it as a different take on how we used to make music. Thanks man!

aVIt sure is nice. But I can't make up my mind if it truly is folk metal. And I am not questioning the folk part, I am questioning the metal part. It is called "post rock" after all. 
p6299
aVThis song might not be metal, that is true. But it certainly isn't post-rock either. Most of their music is post-rock, but this song is not. I don't know exactly what it is, but it has folk music mixed with heavy guitars and drums, so I thought it might be of interest here.

asVSilly Finntroll controversies
p6308
(lp6309
VI personally fucking love Blodsvept. It's got a lot of great folksy, polka influence. I mean, I appreciate the whole black metal appeal but as someone who is primarily a folk/thrash/power fan, it definitely appeals to me for different reasons.\u000a\u000aBut the ears are somehow making it hard to take people seriously? Are we forgetting that people do not take corpsepaint seriously? Or that the whole idea of Satanism, trolls, death, etc. aren't taken seriously outside of metal? There's no way the ears are going to be the one thing that will stop people from taking *polka metal* seriously. It's something that you either appreciate or don't- it may grow on you but it's never gonna grow on you if you don't give a shot, you know?\u000a\u000aPlus, the ears are part of the stage show. From Behemoth's aesthetics to Maiden's antics, it's all very showman-y. The ears are simply part of putting on the show and I'm not sure how that would detract from the music they play.\u000a\u000aMetal tends to be pretty divisive already. Some people are going to hate anything that makes it look like the band cares more about appearance than the music, which I can understand. However, I think if they cared about appearance over music, they wouldn't be playing polka metal. I think the ears are pretty cool and the effort to put on a full-fledged show is always appreciated by me.
p6310
aV&gt; Some people are going to hate anything that makes it look like the band cares more about appearance than the music\u000a\u000aAgreed, and IMHO those people are idiots. They seem to think a band isn't able to do two things well, or that having an image that doesn't come from lyrics or interviews will somehow compromise their music.
p6311
aVI love Blodsvept. Maybe not quite as much as some of their older albums but it's still a really good album.\u000a\u000aAs for the ears. When did they start doing that? I haven't seen them play live for a couple of years now so it might have happened since the last time but I've never noticed them/
p6312
aVI could be wrong, but I am strongly under the impression that they started doing it on the most recent tour.  Pretty sure as well that Vreth's coat in addition to the ears = same as in the video for Haxbrygd.  "Let's make the best use of awesome props we used in a music video and wear that get-up on stage too" = a principle I approve of, as it seems to me it's working well for Behemoth these days also.
p6313
aVGuess that's why I've not noticed it then. I haven't seen them play for a few years now.
p6314
aVI haven't heard the new album yet; thanks for reminding me. Going to give it a listen today. Yeah, I know, ultra-fail; I guess I forgot about it :(\u000a\u000aAs for the ears, meh, I (male) like them.
p6315
aVThe ears go well with the rest of their costume. I liked it. I wish i had pictures of that show :(
p6316
aVhonestly, whatever i think the new album is rad,  i pre-ordered with with a shirt + cd bundle. \u000a\u000aI love the ears and everything, any band that is willing to have cool costumes that corresponded with their music is swell in my books\u000a\u000ado not give a fuck what some butthurt fan is saying.\u000a\u000aif you like it, awesome. if you don't like, it cool\u000a\u000ano one needs to make a huge discussion about this, the band will decide to do whatever they want regardless and it is their decision. 
p6317
aVMale here, I don't give a flying fuck about the ears. Finntroll is still awesome so the ears don't mean shit to me. 
p6318
aVI thought the ears are funny and oddly cute in a way, too (male, n-no homo..), but I don't think they detract from their stage presence.\u000a\u000aThe whole steampunk thing with Blodsvept made me a bit confused at first, but I'm not really complaining, still sounds like Finntroll and I love it. It's a lot more "playful" in a way than Nifelvind, in my opinion, but I think that goes well with their style of folk music.
p6319
aVHonestly, I like the pagentry of folk metal, it only adds to the experience, especially at shows. There isn't a band that takes the stage that isn't concerned with image, *especially* the ones that try to convince you otherwise. \u000a\u000aI didn't hate the steam punk, but I like the older aesthetics they've gone back too. If for no other reason it'll help keep the hipster crowd at bay. 
p6320
aVI thought Niflevind and Blodsvept were by far their best.  They were never  "black metal" and you can tell in their latest album that it's still Finntroll, playing the same music, but with new ideas.\u000a\u000aI personally love Blodsvept and think it's another great album like their previous ones.  \u000a\u000aThe ears might seem silly, but who cares?  It doesn't affect their sound at all.  The reason I love Finntroll is their music and that's how it should always be.  If you let image dictate what you listen to, you're going to miss out on a lot of good music and that's just a pity.
p6321
aVI like all their albums, but i don't like their latest as much as the rest, still like it though. I don't like it as much because I feel it is more guitar first and orientated and other instruments later, the guitar is louder than the other instruments in the album most of the time, and feels like it is the melody line.
p6322
aVI love all of Finntroll's albums, but I thought Blodsvept was exceptionally good.  I appreciated how fun and upbeat it was; it stands out from the darker stuff I normally listen to.  \u000a\u000aThe ears are just part of the image they're going for, and I don't see why anyone would get butthurt about it.  Finntroll is a troll-obsessed band; if anything it should come as a surprise that it took this long for them to dress up like that.
p6323
aVWho cares? The way I see it, they probably just wanted to have a bit of fun and thought it was would be funny. 
p6324
aVThe pointy ears seemed kinda silly to me tbh, that's not just a male thing.  That said, I don't really mind silly things all *that* much, so I'm neutral about it.

asVVintersorg - Döpt I en Jökelsjö [Sweden]
p6358
(lp6359
sVWhy do you like foreign/ethnically different bands?
p6360
(lp6361
VFor me one of the major things was the diverse nature in the music.  Listening to music outside of my pre-established comfort zone is a nice change of pace.  That being said, as a musician, finding new influences from other cultures is a pretty awesome way to develop my toolkit of playing techniques/styles.
p6362
aVwhat do you take from it? the instruments, rhythm, pace, style, whatever is it you kids call it nowadays?
p6363
aVUnfortunately I'm not made of money, so not the instruments.  A lot of the method (riff structure, note choice, music theory etc.) gets absorbed into how I play. I'm from the U.S. so I don't get a whole lot of exposure to tradition folk music of many other cultures, so the influence from that into folk metal also permeates through.  I don't personally write folk-metal music, but I've noticed that several times when writing something on acoustic guitar that I've accidentally stolen riffs from folk-metal songs.\u000aAs far as rhythm goes, much of folk-metal rhythm is rhythm found in many other genres of music, lots of 4/4 in folk metal and lots of shuffling and galloping rhythm which are prevalent in most genres of metal.
p6364
aVFor me its the languages as well as the folk instruments. I grew up loving traditional folk music and going to high school and college with people who had immigrated to the US from other countries made me really appreciate the sound of foreign languages.
p6365
aVI love the atmosphere and complex compositions that are all unified by deceptively simple folk melodies.  I enjoy the diverse intrumentation and the "anything goes" nature of the music.  \u000a\u000aFolk metal is able to contain banjos, accordians, violins, horns, pianos, ethnic percussion, gamelan, saxaphones and even orchestras.  As a composer, this really appeals to me as I love hearing different ways traditional/classical instruments can be used together in new ways.  \u000a\u000aAnd on top of that, metal in general has an intense, grand atmosphere akin to classical symphonies and I find that atmosphere is particularly prevalent in Folk metal.  One of my favourite folk metal bands, Moonsorrow, produce masterful soundscapes like no other.\u000a\u000aOf course I don't exclusively listen to folk metal, but it is the niche genre I enjoy the most.  
p6366
aVI agree with most of what everyone else here says.  Another good thing about music in foreign languages is that you don't notice if the lyrics are shitty if you can't understand it at first.  I'm therefore less concerned with how terrible the lyrics are and more concerned with how awesome everything sounds!
p6367
aVThere's something for everyone. I also love the variety of instruments used in some songs. Really awesome.
