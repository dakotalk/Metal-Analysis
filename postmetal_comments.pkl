sVOcean Districts - Discovery ( Instrumental post-metal/rock official new video)
p7
(lp8
VYou might have heard of the Estonian instrumental post-metal group Ocean Districts by now. They released their debut album Expeditions back in January. Now the group debuts their first video for "Discovery" which features clips from the 1920 silent film Way Down East. \u000aGuitarist and songwriter Martin Lepalaan explains why the band decided to use scenes from this particular film: "Our debut album Expeditions pays homage to the great explorers of our time. This video is also honoring the people willing to sacrifice their health and safety to achieve something great, be it a piece of exquisite art, film or music.\u000a"The film is considered to have one of the most dangerous scenes ever in film history for that time. In addition Director D.W. Griffith was frostbitten on one side of his face during the shooting, and it bothered him the rest of his life. Until the day she died, leading actress Lillian Gish's right hand was somewhat impaired due to the extended filming where her hand was in the icy water. - Metalstorm.net

aVI really like the self-titled album, but after that things got a bit too poppy for my taste.  I hope that new Godflesh album comes out this year.  
p17
aVWe're in the same boat, save for a song or 5 here and there peppered throughout the rest of the Jesu catalogue.  
p18
aVThe last two tracks on the "Silver" EP are also favorites of mine.  Someone needs to explore the Boards of Canada + metal guitars thing more.  
p19
aVYou might like Fuck Buttons. They're not as mellow all the time as BoC is but they use guitars to make electronic music. 
p20
aVAs far as im aware they dont play guitars... Well.. The few times I have seem them they didn't...
p21
aVI saw them live when they released Street Horsing and they had guitars.  Dunno if they still use them live.

p42
aVAwesome jams man, keep it up!
p43
aVFound you guys on some /mu/ thread a while ago when Oceans Into Ashes was released. Needless to say, I'm still high on Maeth.\u000a\u000aGreat stuff. 
p44
aVWait, do you say it where the a is almost silent? How is it supposed to be said?
p45
aVWe say "May-ith." Does that make sense? It's kind of a bad band name for the reasons illuminated in this thread. It comes from ancient Hebrew, and we're mispronouncing it too. We decided it sounded more aesthetic or something. 
p46
aVI always used to say it with a silent "a", sort of like one would say "meth" (obvious, given the context). Your response got me wondering how it was originally meant to be pronounced, though.. My best guess would be "meth", because the music is pretty stonerish and it sounds pretty edgy that way.
p47
aVYour band deserves more attention. I have already listened to 'oceans into ashes' and I loved it. 'Burning turquoise' and 'troodon' are just amazing, and 'nomad' is pretty good too. Please, keep up with the good work, cheers from Portugal.

asVLooking for more post metal like Russian Circles
p55
(lp56
VSince both bands you mentioned are (mostly) instrumental, here are some other bands without vocalists to check out.  \u000a\u000aYou probably already like Pelican, if not the new album is amazing - listen to [Deny the Absolute](http://youtu.be/TOAzNXoSJ1A) if you haven't.  There's also Set and Setting, who are really good - have a listen to [Spiraling Uncertainties](http://youtu.be/a589hTo0IyY) from the debut album.  Kerretta from New Zealand is also definitely worth your time, not always super heavy but really intricate like both Cloudkicker and Russian Circles.  [Onyxia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOT3I8IW9vQ) from their album Saansilo is one of my favorites.  You might also like Watered from Germany.  Their debut album is pretty good - check out [Keratokonis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIDZU1VPVSw).
p57
aVI've only listened to Kerretta out of these, and they are great.  I'm excited to check out the others, thanks!\u000a
p58
aV[deleted]
p59
aVWow they're excellent, good looks.
p60
aVMan, it's so frustrating that Toundra is one of the few post-metal bands I simply don't like, because they're from my country and always play around my area. There are other great bands here like Adrift or El Paramo, though and those I like.
p61
aVThis is fantastic stuff! I'm only on the second track of (III), but great so far.
p62
aVI'd also recommend If These Trees Could Talk. Their Red Forrest album is brilliant. 
p63
aVI definitely second the recommendation for Pelican. They are absolutely fantastic.\u000a\u000aFor more upbeat and intense guitar based instrumental stuff check out Scale the Summit. Their new album The Migration is pretty slick.
p64
aVPelican is required listening for any post-metal and post-rock fan.  Also, Red Sparowes, but they're a little on the softer side.\u000a\u000aDepending on your taste for vocals\u000aI would also like to recommend Rosetta and The Ocean.
p65
aVI came here to suggest The Ocean and Red Sparowes. 
p66
aVIt's a small genre.
p67
aVIf you haven't seen Pelican live I would HIGHLY recommend making it happen. They are fucking brilliant.\u000a\u000aI've never heard The Ocean though so I'll have to check em out. Thanks for the tip.
p68
aVI think you'd like Omega Massif, they're quite similar to Russian Circles. 
p69
aVYear of No Light\u000a\u000aCloud Archive\u000a\u000aToundra\u000a\u000aIrepress\u000a\u000aNinth Moon Black
p70
aVIrepress is criminally underrated, and worth it beyond words. \u000a\u000a"Sol Eye Sea I" is endlessly playable, and one of the catchiest instrumental albums I know of (and I can name a few, haha). "Samus Octology" is just as creatively wild, but definitely more raw, and chunky. \u000a\u000aSheel Dave is one of the best drummers out there. 
p71
aVDude I have been waiting for some new music from these guys for so long. I check their Facebook a few times a week looking for announcements, been a very quiet year from them.  One of my favorites for sure.
p72
aVI'm Facebook friends with Shan, and they seem to be doing more work outside of music, at the moment. Then again, he doesn't post a lot, so it's not the best source. Not to mention Sheel has all of those nasty back problems that probably hold him back, at times. \u000a\u000aI'm in the same boat with Genghis Tron. They went on hiatus in 2010, and literally no word since then has been said about any aspect of the band. Mookie is a band manager for Purity Ring, Girl Talk, and some others, but nothing about work with GT.\u000a\u000aI still hold onto hope, though. I can't let go, haha. 
p73
aVI found out about YONL last week or so.  Would suggest for Pelican/RC fans.
p74
aVLong Distance Calling
p75
aVRussian Circles is one of my favorites. Did you know they're on tour at the moment?\u000a\u000aSo I think it would help if you described what it is that you like about their sound. For now, I suggest Dysrythmia, Explosions in the Sky (a bit softer), Maserati, Mogwai (some vocals) and Caspian. Now I'm going to go check out Cloudkicker since you mentioned them with Russian Circles! \u000a\u000aThanks!   
p76
aVThanks, I've edited above.  And I saw that, but sadly they are not coming anywhere near to me :(\u000a\u000aAnd Cloudkicker is fairly varied in sound; when I said he was post-metal-esque, I had in mind The Discovery, The Map is Not the Territory, Portmanteau, ]]][[[, or Beacons (though Beacons may be more prog than post).  Hope that helps.
p77
aVI wouldn't really say Mogwai is post metal, maybe post rock. Don't take that for saying don't listen to them though. They are seriously badass.
p78
aVYeah, you are right. I was actually surprised to seen Russian Circles listed as post-metal, too. 
p79
aVCheck out [Adai](http://cavityrecords.bandcamp.com/track/bodies).\u000a\u000aEdit: also, [Ocoai.](http://ocoaiband.bandcamp.com/track/breatherman)
p80
aVI hadn't heard of Cloudkicker (checking him out now... I like!), but been into RC for a while.  Pelican, Red Sparowes, and Caspian are definitely on my list when I'm in the mood for something in that vein.  Red Sparowes and Caspian a little softer and more dynamic, Pelican a bit riffier and louder.  One notch louder and sludgier I'd put Capricorns (which I love to work/drive to).
p81
aVAs others mentioned, Pelican for sure.  I'd also drop in ISIS, as well as Bossk who was recently picked up by Deathwish.
p82
aVYou may like [Audrey Fall](http://audreyfall.bandcamp.com/)
p83
aVNot all of these are strictly post metal, but here are some bands (and an album) that I think RC fans would enjoy:\u000a\u000a Torche - "In Return" (only band listed with vocals, beyond worth it)\u000a\u000aIrepress - "Sol Eye Sea I"\u000a\u000aCaspian - "The Four Trees"\u000a\u000aThe Samuel Jackson Five - "Goodbye Melody Mountain"\u000a\u000aVolta Do Mar - "At the Speed of Light or Day"\u000a\u000aRed Sparowes - "At the Soundless Dawn"\u000a\u000a
p84
aVSomeone already mentioned the Ocean, so here's a link to [Pelagial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfZMTDcqKnQ), IMO their best album hands down. \u000a\u000a[Lyrics](http://www.darklyrics.com/lyrics/theocean/pelagial.html)

aVCoL has two drummers but I believe Thomas Hedlund is the main one. Assuming that is fact: http://istanbulcymbals.com/artists/205/thomas-hedlund.html. \u000aThe only other thing I could find was on his facebook page where it states he uses Ludwig Vistalite which has a 22x14 bass drum.\u000a\u000aHope that helps! 
p95
aVWell, can't help you much but just so you know : CoL have two drummers, each one a different kind of set...
p96
aVThey still use 2 drummers? Is the guy in Phoenix still active in the band? I would have thought he left after Phoenix got huge.
p97
aVRight, but on album it's just 1 guy. Either way, all their drums sound so good

Stop not listening to them.
p102
aVSince you asked so nicely!
p103
aVWell, Neurosis, Cult of Luna, Alcest and Ocoai are my favourites besides Isis. I suggest you have a listen to Isis two albums Oceanic and Panopticon, most think they are their best albums, so be sure to check those out. \u000a\u000aAlso, if you don't have any issues with more black metal(ish) I'd suggest you check out Negura Bunget, Agalloch and Deafhaven. 
p104
aVIf you like black/post metal, you should definitely check out Altar of Plagues.
p105
aVI have actually listened to Agalloch. Some black metal ain't have bad. Just got Ne Obliviscaris's "Portal of I" the other day.
p106
aVI was just listening to [Fields of Locust](http://fieldsoflocust.bandcamp.com/album/subtopia) today and remembered how great they are.  Their singer sounds a little weird - very raspy - but musically, it's fantastic.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Here's a few more songs that I dig:\u000a\u000a[Steak Number Eight - The Sea is Dying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbSQj3EzTI)\u000a\u000a[Destroy Judas - Drown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikNuuXbPFYA)\u000a\u000a[Isis - Grinning Mouths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVAnKLsaFAo) (this is from the Panopticon album, which many feel is their best (though others argue it's Oceanic) - the whole album is incredible)\u000a\u000a[Neurosis - Stones From the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaxNnoKrK9o) - TIL there's an actual music video for this!\u000a\u000a[Blindead - Affliction XXVII II MMIX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44hd8KlMRZo)\u000a\u000a[Cloaca - The Golden Path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n3b3vnsyNA)\u000a\u000a[Mouth of the Architect - How This Will End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAqsOGQESsg).  These guys are my personal favorite and this song and the album on which it appears (Dawning) are phenomenal.\u000a\u000aI'll try to think of some more later.  I've discovered a lot of artists from this subreddit; others (and one of my favorite ways) is to just head to YouTube, look up a post-metal song I like, then check out a bunch of related videos.  It's a great way to discover new music.
p107
aVOh WOW! Thanks so much, dude! It'll take a bit but I'll get around to listening to all of these! Thanks again!

p146
aV&gt;Instead of a 4-song showcase of newer sounds, this is a big single-song experiment \u2014 a studio piece where we get to make sounds that we wouldn\u2019t get to make otherwise, with no intention of it ever being performed live. It\u2019s just a big empty canvas, motivated by the question of what is possible from a compositional standpoint, rather than a performance standpoint. We can\u2019t play like a 10-piece band, but we can write like one. It\u2019s also fun to use many more different instruments than we could ever possibly bring on tour.\u000a\u000aSounds promising!

p179
aVThe sidebar had some great recommendations.  Some members of Bossk started a band called the Mire IIRC.  They have a great EP available.   Also Monkey3 is worth your time. Instrumental, heavy and melodic. Not too droney. \u000a\u000aJakob is another band you should listen to.  They're more on the post - rock side of things, very atmospheric metal sound.   Highly recommended. They've got a lot of albums but don't be afraid to start with any of them. \u000a\u000aAlso if you can find it, Hippie Killer by Bongripper is great.   Its more stoner rock, no vocals and very repetitive of you're into that style. 
p180
aVIs The Mire any good? What do they sound like? 
p181
aVIt's been a while since I listened but i would say it sounded like the vocalist is the same from Bossk.  It reminded more of the second EP though not as slow nor bass-heavy.   It was just a couple of songs which I liked alright, but mostly recommended because of the Bossk connection.   
p182
aVHippie Killer is one of my favorite albums so yeah definitely into that, and I'll have to check out Jakob and Mire, thanks man!

aVAtmospheric sludge.\u000aThe slow build and textured guitar of post-rock combined with a sludgy metal sound.\u000aAtmospheric metal that focuses on contrasting heavy elements with beautiful tones to create an entrancing sound.\u000a\u000aI mean shit, how do you describe music in general? It's always much easier to describe it in terms of things they already know. If you spring a bunch of new stuff on them (like having to explain sludge metal, post-rock, and atmospheric music) they're probably not going to get it anyways.
p209
aV"Post metal is some of the heaviest music out there, but not in the context you'd might think of. One is literally driven into a massive, overbearing landscape, as pulsating guitars crush the eardrums of the listener, the sparse and sharp drums managing to pierce through the muddled mess of distorted strings. Furthermore, your landscape has a voice, a particularly harsh one that is difficult to hear at first."\u000a-Matt Conrad of Sputnikmusic
p210
aVThat's quite the pretentious description. Captures the feeling but not much of the sound IMO.

aVI kind of agree. It's a description for post-metal fans, not people who've never heard of the genre.

aVwell it's not mine, just a quote from a reviewer that i found accurately described what post-metal is about.

p264
aVI get the impression that Europe is the real home of post-metal, as I see more underground and upcoming bands from there all the time. Cult of Luna does most their touring in Europe, for example. \u000a\u000aIn North America, post-metal is like voices in the wilderness. I've listened to Cult of Luna for almost 10 years (god I feel old), and it was only a couple of years ago that I met another real person that had even heard of them.

There are so many great tangential Isis projects still going strong, and the forthcoming collaboration with Chino from Deftones, that I'm pretty hopeful about the future.  Even if it is a future without Isis.
p288
aVI agree, they're still relevant without the Isis moniker that it almost seems like Isis itself is still around, if that makes sense? I'm very excited about Palms! Cliff split off with Jeff and formed Red Sparowes, which I love, and from them came Marriages. There's others like Old Man Gloom, Split Cranium and Mammifer that are great as well. I'm grateful for them, I give Altered Course credit for being my first love of post rock/metal. Isis is that special band for me.

VI agree to an extent.  I do feel there's a definite "feel" to most post-metal bands; bands that may not be very similar sonically still share some element that makes me enjoy the both of them for the same reasons.  \u000a\u000aMost bands we'd call "post metal" won't describe themselves as "post metal" I've found.  I guess most artists don't like to limit themselves to one genre, but I feel post-metal is a pretty wide open genre and there are really not a lot of post metal bands that sound the same.  That's why I love the genre; I can listen to Terra Tenebrosa for one minute and Cult of Luna the next and they don't sound anything a like but they both give me something that bands outside the genre won't.

aVSome info about the EP that they [posted](http://rosettaband.tumblr.com/post/83720147323/new-ep-update) a few months back:\u000a\u000a&gt; Our new EP, titled Flies to Flame, is being mastered this week. It\u2019ll be out later this year in traditional formats \u2014 LP and CD \u2014 on Translation Loss Records. This not a pay-what-you-wish digital release.\u000a&gt; \u000a&gt; This recording was a departure from our normal working style. We wrote the material in late 2012 and recorded it in a garage in early 2013, while we were writing The Anaesthete. It\u2019s deliberately lo-fi, jangly, and experimental, a tribute to the stripped-down sound of the post-rock and drone records we loved when Rosetta began. Most of it was improvised as it was being recorded, and it was not edited or \u2018fixed\u2019 to make it sound polished. All the grit is there. We used different instruments and equipment than we normally play with, since this material isn\u2019t intended to be played live. Instead it functions as a kind of process document, from an important and transitional year in our life as a band.\u000a&gt; \u000a&gt; For the first time since The Galilean Satellites, we did all recording and mixing ourselves (with the invaluable help of our intern engineer, Alex Ruday). Mike Wohlberg is returning to create the artwork and layout, and James Plotkin is mastering it for both CD and vinyl.\u000a&gt; \u000a&gt; Track list:\u000a&gt; 1. Soot\u000a&gt; 2.

aVmoney-wise, half of the profits goes to us and half to our label Threshold of Pain (brand new startup label). Matt, the guy in charge funded half of the pressing of this; we wouldn't have been able to press it if it weren't for his generosity and support for what we're trying to do. that said, the profits aren't much simply due to how much this thing cost to press lol. it's a behemoth!

p408
aVThey're definitely close enough. I'm glad you posted this as I had no idea they released a new EP.
p409
aVCenotes is good imo, but lacks that substance that The Icthyologist contained with songs like Sevengill or Dead man Slough. I think I miss the harmonised female vocals, but the emphasised cello is gorgeous in this. 
p410
aVReally? I thought cenotes was better than Ichyologist because the songs had more depth where as Ichyologist came off as a little too pop-py (specifically in the drumming) in some parts (just couldn't shake how much that bass riff in throwing a donner party at sea sounded like greenday). 
p411
aVHmmm interesting. I really liked the bass, but I haven't heard much Green Day (if any) so I can't really offer an opinion there. Again what I said above was all opinion, but I feel as though The Icthyologist was a stronger album... Maybe that's because it was longer! Either way, it's all really good to me. \u000aGot an example of that Green Day bass?

I bought the CD at the merch table.\u000a\u000aLive 3 was recorded at the same venue (Launchpad, ABQ). I was at that show, too.

If you're interested, [here's a track that I've written](https://soundcloud.com/mynameisjonjo/long-walks-on-the-beach). Like I said, bit cheeky.. But it'd be cool if someone who inspired me to write this would be able to have a listen. No worries if not aha.

aVYou're track is great, I'd love to hear more if you have it. Do you have a band or is it all just you?

[Here is another track](https://soundcloud.com/mynameisjonjo/a-weekend-at-the-end-of), it's a similar style, but a wee bit heavier. The stuff on my Soundcloud is all written and recorded by myself. I do have a band though, we're called Vera Grace. The music is generally heavier, but take a lot of Post-Metal style influence in the music too, especially in the new E.P we're writing.

p510
aVI wish. Chicago gets a few acts a year, but no festival type shindigs. There doesn't seem to be too much of a following here. More people seem to like post rock, or indie music.\u000a\u000aAlthough, Wicker Park Fest had Baroness headline last year. And ISIS headlined three years ago. So that was all right.

aVDon't forget about Yakuza playing in 2010! Chicago has a HUGE fanbase for post-metal. The Atlas Moth,Bongripper,Pelican,Russian Circles,and Indian to just name a few bands that are chi-town based.
p512
aVThere's needs to be a huge sludge metal fest.  It needs to be headlined by the Melvins and have all the big names, eyehategod, Crowbar, Pelican, High On Fire etc.  Maybe even Mastodon and Baroness, just to get people to pay attention.

While I love that you came in from that side rather than starting with BM, it would have been nicer (and provided more variety) if it went further into BM territory at times.\u000aOther than that is was quite enjoyable.\u000a\u000aNow as a friendly guy:\u000a\u000aYou should be quite proud of this. It sounds great and I don't really hear too much that's more post-rock than it is black-metal. Keep up the good work and be sure to post whatever new material you have on here. Where are the download/buy links?

If it's been too long i'll open 'set your own price' purchasing.\u000a\u000aGlad you enjoyed it, I not trying to impose any genre on the music, it is what it is. The new material is sitting more on the darker side (apart from a single which is B-side from the album and is getting expanded upon - its similar to the album).\u000a\u000aI'll definitely keep you guys in the loop!

aVJust saw Russian Circles the other week along with BTBAM and Intervals.\u000a\u000a[INTERVALS "In Time" EP - Full Album Stream ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyBrxxUWO28)\u000a\u000aMuch more progressive but still may be enjoyable.

aVLove Russian Circles! I'll look up the latter.
p629
aVJust thought of [Stallone](http://stallone.bandcamp.com/album/stallone).\u000a\u000aAbout Karma to Burn, check out their album Almost Heithen. You'll probably like that one the most.
p630
aVPelican is best in genre in my humble opinion
p631
aVPelican is great, but they've never topped Australasia.
p632
aVIn my opinion, every Pelican album tops Australasia.\u000a\u000aedit: reworded
p633
aVTo each his own.  I love Australasia and March Into the Sea is a close second for me.  The Fire In Our Throats... was fine.  I was disappointed in City of Echoes (particularly) and the rest.  I think I listened to What We All Come To Need a bit, but it didn't do much for me.
p634
aVIndeed, my order is almost the complete opposite. City of Echoes takes the cake for me, with What We All Come To Need and Ataraxia/Taraxis tied up for second. Then Fire In Our Throats, with Australasia coming up last.\u000a
p635
aVI see.  Well, if you like Pelican you might also enjoy [Omega Massif](http://omegamassif.bandcamp.com/).  Check them out if you haven't.  They remind me of Pelican, but I like them more, though that may be b/c they're a bit noisier and heavier (and that may be the opposite of where you'd take Pelican to improve them).  Cheers.
p636
aVI do know them, I have Karpatia actually. You're right though, I definitely like the more uplifting aspects of Pelican, and Omega Massif is heavier and sludgy.
p637
aVPelican is great. I've listened to them for years now.
p638
aVIf only they had better drums. I still love them plus i'm from Chicago.
p639
aVYou might like\u000a[Out Run the Sunlight](http://outrunthesunlight.bandcamp.com)\u000aAnd I can never help but recommend [Cloudkicker](http://cloudkicker.bandcamp.com)  specifically *Beacons* and *The Discovery* for post metal, but seriously every single thing this guy releases is gold IMO
p640
aVBen Sharp can do no wrong. His work is so unique, yet is changing all the time.
p641
aVAbsolutely.  I just discovered that he posts ideas of his that didnt make it into an album on soundcloud.  They are pretty awesome too.

p654
aVScale The Summit is hands-down my favorite instrumental band, and my favorite band in general. They're far more in the progressive realm, but most of their songs are incredibly uplifting. \u000a\u000aMore instrumental bands I like:\u000a\u000a* Pelican\u000a* Animals As Leaders\u000a* Spaces\u000a* Cloudkicker\u000a* If These Trees Could Talk\u000a* T.R.A.M.\u000a* Chimp Spanner\u000a\u000aThese final two are nothing like the rest at all, they both write old-school hip hop beats with glitchy sounds and voice clips thrown in, no rapping. I enjoy them a great deal, some of you may also:\u000a\u000a* Prefuse 73\u000a* Dabrye\u000a

aVYou might try out Meniscus as well
p660
aVLove Meniscus! Fight Club has such a good drop at the end.
p661
aVThe best post metal has vocals. That's just the way it is. You are missing out on a ton of great music.\u000a\u000aBut a really good pure instrumental band that is metal-ish is [Jakob](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ld3c_IVmk8)
p662
aVOh I'm not saying I'm not interested! I'm a vocal major so I'm really picky about the voice. The growling in Ocean was great, but I'm not fond of his dark, throaty singing. For instance, I love cult of Luna. If there are bands that have better singing, I'd be totally down to listen to that.

aVI agree, and find their first album more dynamic and with nicer, less generic song structures. The new one feels more processed. I feel like it's at its best when it's more black, and in that case it sounds a lot like a shittier version of Krallice. Although nonetheless, I like it as well.

aVyeah, that is true. I need them to come play in my backyard. lol.

aVIt's not really post-metal. This is neo-crust along the lines of Downfall of Gaia. Obviously enough here for post-metal fans to be into it though. As urbangeneticist pointed out though the singer (and I think a band member or two) formed Light Bearer which is a post-metal band and they're fucking amazing.\u000a\u000aI disagree that FoF only gets better.

aVThe main things that bother me about their new sound (starting with The Violence Beneath) is that firstly, the drums are way too loud! They drown out the guitar work, which is related to another issue; Alex Vernon is no longer playing guitar and I believe he is a signature to their sound on 'Quietly' as is Greg Lahm on 'Ties That Blind'. the new guitarists are probably the reason for the change in overall tone and the decision to pop the hell out of that snair.

aVThere were a few copies going on Ebay the other week and I decided I was going to win the particular auction I bid on.

aVI think either Turner or Harris, or maybe even someone like Danny Carey (he seems like the only member of Tool who might be willing to do something like this).  But I don't think we should just limit ourselves to /r/postmetal.  Any name like Turner and Harris would do really well in /r/metal, meatheads aside.

aVI think this is the best idea - especially if we're talking about guys from Isis, since so many people that are just into metal and not post metal actually dig Isis.\u000a\u000aTurner would be my first choice.

p1302
aVPanopticon is my favorite because to me it just seems like the most cohesive from start to finish. People who argue Oceanic is better have good arguments, and it's all a matter of opinion and I respect those opinions, but to me Oceanic's one problem is it doesn't have as logical a flow as Panopticon does. \u000a\u000aI think it's specifically that way because of where "Weight" comes in the album, I think having that song in the middle throws off all the mood and tempo the album builds at the start. This is not to say I don't like "Weight" as an individual song, fact is it's in my top 3 Isis songs in their catalog. I just think it might've worked better as a closer for the album (though Hym is also an amazing closer). Panopticon just seems so much more visionary and dramatic from my point of view. That's just my two cents.
p1303
aVWe should post the album to /r/music in celebration of Panopticon to get more people on to it.
p1304
aVThe first time I heard Isis was during their tour with Tool also. Similarly I didn't get into them right away the sound at the show wasn't very good and the vocals were not done justice. Your title definitely made me laugh. For me, I love Panopticon because no matter what mood I'm in it always makes me feel really good. I can just sit a chill with a drink and get lost for an hour. I was pretty devastated when they decided to break-up, (although I did get to see them perform Wavering Radiant) but then I found Old Man Gloom which I was happy for. 
p1305
aVGoddamn I am glad to see this thread. \u000a\u000aPanopticon is a top five album of mine and is a lost of the reason I'm aware of most of my other favorite albums. I think I probably heard The Beginning and the End or So Did We first which is sort of interesting considering they're the openers for their respective albums. \u000a\u000aThe more I listened to Isis the more I became fond of their closers though, which is why, I guess, Threshold of Transformation is my preferred ISIS song. \u000a\u000aThat being said, I copped [this](http://imgur.com/de89bOm) recently and am really enjoying it today. Side B is moving nicely through 'In Fiction' and Side C has the fucking massive duo of 'Syndic Calls' and 'Altered Course' that marks the album's peak for me. 
p1306
aVDude, Threshold is a MONSTER. They closed with that when I saw them on their farewell tour; the strength of that song as a closer combined with the situation gave me goosebumps.
p1307
aVOceanic has more of my favourite songs, but Panopticon is a better album overall. Slightly disappointed with the later albums, didn't get into them anywhere near as much :(
p1308
aVEven though I thoroughly enjoy both ITAOT and Wavering Radiant, and in some ways I think they're more well thought out than Panopticon (and certainly better produced), I think just about anything they could have done would have disappointed after Panopticon.  It's such an incredible album that it dims how good their next two albums were.
p1309
aVLike you, I got into ISIS through prog metal, which led me to their proggiest record Wavering Radiant.\u000a\u000aI have a soft spot for Wavering Radiant, but Oceanic is my personal favourite.
p1310
aVHeh, I got into Isis when they toured with Tool that year too. It was pretty amazing seeing them both at the same time. I fell hard for Isis right away, but some of my friends didn't. I don't know if they didn't get it or what. Fast forward a few years and my buddy (who provided the tickets for that Tool/Isis show) was asking if I remembered them. I was like, HELL YEA DUDE WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT I LOVED THEM! And he was like, Well I've been really digging them lately man, I don't know why I didn't like them at first. Then he broke the news to me that they broke up and he was searching around for Red Sparrowes stuff.

aVI got into ISIS during the Panopticon tour with Dalek and Zombi opening for them at the Avalon in NYC. Changed my interest in music considerably.\u000a\u000aThough I have a very warm spot in my heart for Panopticon (in particular So Did We and In Fiction, both of which are incredibly emotionally wroth), I have come to appreciate Wavering Radiant quite a bit, lately.\u000a\u000aThreshold of Transformation is probably the most complete sounding ISIS song and ends that album and their career in a thorough manner.  It's the closest they got to a total Pink Floyd style of sound (particularly the extended guitar solo in mid-song, very reminiscent of Echoes). Hall of the Dead is a great opener (though not quite as crushing as So Did We) and Hand of the Host has one of the best riffs in any song.\u000a\u000aAnd then there's always Celestial.\u000a\u000aAnother great little gem is the Sawblade EP. In particularly, their cover of Godflesh's [Streetcleaner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QssxY7e3qM)....
p1312
aVFor me, So Did We is the reason Panopticon is the best album. I could forget the rest and still feel that way, the song really changed my perception of music 
p1313
aVThat song has to be one of the greatest of all time. It's so dark and somber. I've never heard a song that can evoke so many emotions as that one.
p1314
aVYeah it's just unbelievable. It tops my ipod play count with about 1100 plays, and I haven't been listening to it as much as I used to a year or two ago. The song at 6:15 after the buildup, just perfect 
p1315
aVDamn, 1100 plays is no joke haha. I listen to ISIS on cd a lot so i'd guess im at around 2-300. Regardless the song/album/band is amazing.
p1316
aVI am interested in hearing how the remastered version sounds like on vinyl. I can't seem to find original version in vinyl for a decent price...
p1317
aVI had heard of Isis from a friend and had skimmed through Celestial then forgotten about them for a while. However one day I decided to them up on Itunes and found that Panopticon was on sale so I bought it without even thinking about it. As soon as the vibrations went through my ears I fell in love with that band and started listening to that album non-stop. Whenever I feel down that's my go to album.
p1318
aVIt's the best album for feeling gloomy. Though Backlit is refreshingly upbeat.
p1319
aVHeh, your journey into metal was similar to mine.  Metallica, Pantera, "lighter" stuff and I couldn't stand the growls of death metal until the same exact album you mentioned, Blackwater Park.\u000a\u000aFrom there I started getting REALLY into death metal until someone I used to chat with on some message board sent me a couple of songs that made me realize how much more you can get from music: Lightendday by Pelican and Stones From the Sky by Neurosis.  From there I would search out new bands similar to Pelican and Neurosis and somehow stumbled upon Panopticon and it's remained one of my favorite albums ever since.\u000a\u000aIt's kind of a joke among my friends now that the only music I *really* give a shit about anymore is post metal.  I still dig some other types of metal, and classic rock and grunge and stuff like that, but the only music that I really seek out these days is post metal.  There's just not much out there that can compare, IMO.  
p1320
aVIn the Absence of Truth is my favorite, but Panopticon is the first of them I heard. I immediately bought the album after hearing a soundbit of So Did We.

VHi. I've listened to the Songs of Sadko and a few of the MMMMM my critical view is:  \u000a1. the sound of your guitars is pretty good  \u000a2. the riffs are quite fine  \u000a3. the compositions are boring, they take 'years' to gain momentum and after they finaly 'start' there isn't much to them.  \u000aSongs are like stories, or for better comparison like sex. In the very basic outline you need beginning/foreplay, story peak/climax, ending/relaxation. Your foreplay is too long, I never climax and then I realy don't feel a need to rest. The older you get the more thrills you need to get aroused - surprise me from time to time!  \u000a4. I feel that you need more 'layers' of guitars in your songs. Add something besides the riff, some more low tones or some high repetitive patterns. Something that will diversify the song and make it bloom like a flower.  \u000a5. don't give up and work on your songs - after all it's also (sadly) work. Inventing a riff is cool but turning it into song is hard hard work.  \u000a6. i see a potential so good luck with your sound.

VI know I'll be down voted for this, but someone has to say it.  These posts need to be down voted for not fostering a discussion on the artist.  If you're going to post a song youtube link, you need to tell us why *you* like it and why it means so much to *you*.  Every single music subreddit is littered with active youtube, dead links.  It's disheartening.

aVI get what you are saying and I DO agree, however, there is something to be said for posting links.  I personally am a post-metal junkie.

p1380
aVWell I figured I'd shoot the gap and post it here. Actually is it really that far of a stretch to call it post-metal? I mean what is post-metal if not a combination of post-rock and metal? Is it inappropriate to loosely refer to a combination of post-rock and black metal as post-metal? And, yeah I really hadn't heard much of these guys before, but this song's fucking spectacular.
p1381
aVDude, listen to [Roads To Judah](http://deafheavens.bandcamp.com/releases) immediately.
p1382
aVHaha, I listened to it as soon as I heard this new track. It's freaking awesome. I'm kinda kicking myself for not checking these guys out earlier.
p1383
aVPost-metal is essentially atmospheric sludge. It is not just any combination of post-rock and metal.\u000a\u000aThe term you're looking for is post-black metal.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.last.fm/tag/post-black%20metal
p1384
aVThat's not what Wikipedia says. Haha, but regardless, I don't think it's that important. I know what the genre "is". It seems a bit on the needlessly specific side to me. And there's not even a post-black metal sub. \u000a\u000aEdit: Maybe it's not that nit picky or overly specific, but I still maintain that it's not a stretch to use post-metal as a general blanket term for them. As they blend a type of metal with post-rock.
p1385
aV&gt;As they blend a type of metal with post-rock.\u000a\u000aWhich is not what post-metal means. -_-\u000a\u000aAnyways, there isn't a post-black sub, but post-black is still allowed (and liked if it's not popular) on /r/blackmetal.
p1386
aV[Hey man, the internet doesn't lie!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-metal)
p1387
aV" Isis, who like Neurosis are linked to the sludge metal scene"\u000a\u000aHurr durr. The wikipedia article is written like shit. Ever read the article on emo and seen how bad that is? They try and incorporate the MTVEmo term and it's a huge mess.
p1388
aVYeah, Neurosis and Isis are pretty sludgy. I mean Souls at Zero and everything prior were all more hardcore and sludge influenced right? Even stuff after that was as well. I'm not trying to really say anything against the pioneers of the genre having roots in different genres of metal. Also, there's no way you can dispute the validity of [THIS](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120208184840AAYL1e7). Read it and weep, chump.
p1389
aVSouls at Zero definitely has that hardcore influence but no one considered Neurosis post-metal at that point. It was after that (with Through Silver in Blood) when they adopted that. Though personally I think that's a bit of a Talk Talk situation where you could argue that they weren't the first band in the genre they were just the ones that moved music as a whole into creating the genre when they influenced others.
p1390
aVAlso, if you're unhappy with the wiki article and you think it's inaccurate, you could look into rewriting and correcting it.
p1391
aVThey'd likely not allow the edit because no sources were cited and revert it even though no sources indicate that the genres listed are what are part of post-metal. The article even goes on to say: " post-metal contain many elements similar to doom metal, progressive metal, sludge metal, and stoner metal. "\u000a\u000aWhy they don't include this from the get go is beyond me.
p1392
aVIt probably should mention it earlier. If I recall correctly though they refer to a few of those that you quoted as related topics or something in the box at the at the top right. I could be wrong though.
p1393
aVhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRedUF0SAGg\u000a\u000aToo heavy for /r/postrock and /r/blackmetal has too many purists...\u000a\u000aHoping to see this guys open for Boris pretty soon. \u000a\u000a
p1394
aVWho cares if there's too many purists? That's where it belongs. Plus, it's always fun to piss those people off.
p1395
aVYeah those purists over at /r/blackmetal will probably have a field day. They'll probably try and claim it doesn't fit on their Reddit,  then they'll go on to say that the wikipedia article regarding post-metal is inaccurate, or poorly written.  That's what those dummies over there will do.  Not like us here though... We are so much smarter.\u000a
p1396
aVDo you think Wikipedia is a legitimate source? I'm not sure what you're getting at here. Deafheaven is clearly a BM band. At least, until we here the rest of this album.
p1397
aVApparently, I'm the only one who found your statements incredibly ironic.  No I don't think Wikipedia is a legitimate source, but you apparently do, as you used it to backup  the argument that only bands based in sludge can be considered post-metal.\u000a\u000aWhat I was getting at was your "not in my backyard" attitude. That despite appealing to many users here (one of the most up-voted posts on /r/postmetal) and sharing many attributes with what purists (such as yourself) consider post-metal, you suggest that it  isn't pure enough to be posted here and instead should be used as fodder to irritate the purist users of the black metal reddit.\u000a\u000aInstead, perhaps someone should make a post-black metal reddit so you can troll that too.
p1398
aV&gt;as you used it to backup the argument that only bands based in sludge can be considered post-metal.\u000a\u000aI don't think you followed that argument very closely. The other guy was using wikipedia to point out how post-metal *isn't* sludge + post-rock and was rather just "metal + post-rock." I then used the wikipedia article itself to point out the inconsistency of the way it's written and how it later on has 2 direct references to sludge.\u000a\u000aPeople will upvote anything if it's on topic or not. Just look at whenever someone posts Explosions in the Sky on /r/postrock. Everyone bitches about it in teh comments because it's the most obvious thing ever to post but it gets half a million upvotes. The same thing happens with Burzum on /r/blackmetal. Upvotes seem to come from people who aren't very involved in the community and don't match care for topicality or if it's anything interesting.\u000a\u000aPlain and simple: This isn't post-metal in any way.

p1461
(lp1462
VGreat article. To put it into perspective, I've never purchased a single Russian Circles album, yet I have all of them on my mp3 player and I've been listening to them for years.\u000a\u000aI've seen them about 7 or 8 times live now, and I buy a t-shirt at every show. Hell, I even donated money to the guys when they had that accident a few years ago where their van was wrecked and Dave had his drums destroyed. \u000a\u000aAm I a pirate? Sure am. Do I still support the bands that I think are worthy of my money? You bet. 
p1463
aVWow, this is very close to what I think, as well. \u000a\u000aI constantly look for new bands, and I also pirate a *lot* in the process. However, I'm also spending money on buying quite a lot of music, because, similarly to Brian, I want the real albums. I want a physical item, and not just a self burnt disc or a mixtape, I want *the real deal*. A symbol of my appreciation or love for the band or artist.\u000a\u000aLately, I've also started buying more LPs, even though I don't have the appropriate equipment to play that format. Why? Because usually, if I really like a band (which I probably do, if I'm buying their records), I already have their albums, most likely in a very high quality format as well. So I might as well cough up ten bucks more, support the artist with it and get something even better myself. \u000a\u000aBeing a poor student, however, I don't have all that much money to spend on albums, but I will slowly and surely support the artists I appreciate the most. And deepest apologies for Brian: although I'm an avid Russian Circles fan, I've yet to purchase any records; something I'm hoping to fix ASAP. I did pay to see Russian Circles live last spring, I hope that counts as being supportive!
p1464
aVLooks like Brian is keen on the status of the recording industry in addition to being an awesome musician. I saw RC live last month and the best way I could come up with to support the band was to buy Empros on Bandcamp in Lossless format. While it's not the same as getting a physical CD, I support Bandcamp because it's a very forward-thinking business model that actually respects artists, unlike most conventional record labels. I believe it's a 70-30 split between the artist and Bandcamp. I pirate just as much as anyone, but I try to support the artist whenever possible.
p1465
aV&gt;recording industry \u000a\u000aHe's not really talking about the industry. He explicitly states:\u000a\u000a&gt;"this isn\u2019t about money as much as it is about entitlement and maintaining a sustainable underground infrastructure"\u000a\u000aHe's talking about keeping independent record labels and distributors alive, not major labels.\u000a\u000aBandcamp only takes 15%. The artist will only get the other 85% if it's self-published which isn't the norm for many who actually make money off of Bandcamp. That will be through a label.

VSince Isis broke up I've been expecting this day to come. Honestly though, I think the bands that were on Hydra Head will be able to do better through services like Bandcamp. They won't have to press albums anymore (I mostly mean CDs)! I think there are services that will press vinyl of digital albums though, so vinyl collectors will still be able to get their goods.
p1511
aVThis is sad news, but it's probably actually more amazing they made it this far. I feel bad for the bands, but I'm sure the really good ones will land on their feet. You don't get rich on this kind of music, but there's enough vinyl-collecting beardos out there to get by. 
p1512
aVIt's not hard to put out vinyl DIY, I've seen quite a few bands do it. Just goes to show very few labels are safe in the current state of the music industry. I agree, most of these bands will do alright and will most likely pick up on other labels, or just keep it real on their own. Hydra Head's end is most certainly the end of an era though. 
p1513
aVThe bands will do fine. Sure. But who is going to pay for their studio time and mastering?
p1514
aVThe bands will, like they always have. They would have had to let money go to Hydra Head for that in the first place. They bands may even have their own recording equipment (not unrealistic, I own enough recording equipment that I could make an album and I'm not in a band currently).
p1515
aVi think one of the sadder things they stated is that one of the reasons for their "demise" is the music indistry nowadays. i can only assume "music industry" refers to the top record companies and the terrible music they are into producing and releasing right now. not to mention how they like to "run" things.\u000a\u000a\u000aas someone who runs a record label in canada, watching shipping costs rise and watching this stronghold the "music industry" has on everything work more and more in their favour has made me debate whether or not i want to continue to support bands and people i love...or deal with the horribly stupid people who are allowed this much power. i can deal with a lot of things, but, money hungry assholes are not one of them.\u000a\u000a\u000asorry HH. take care (and reprint some daughters shirts PLEASE. mine is looking more like a rag versus a shirt).\u000a\u000ascotty\u000a\u000adwyer records.
p1516
aVI think "industry" refers to "labels who want to make money" rather than "labels who just want to release things." Even independent labels have to face the same sort of economics. People are just plain buying less music. Artists are doing okay. They can still tour and make a bit of cash (at least to support their touring efforts.) However, with people buying less music, these labels are finding less to survive off of. Which is unfortunate because obviously not every label that's paying to put bands in the studio and get their work mastered, printed, and released, is not evil.

(lp1552
VI think the thing I admire most about Intronaut is how true to their particular sound they remain. I'm glad they're not just an ISIS rip off (even though I adore ISIS) and continue to explore avenues of their own style. The harmonic vocals in this song have a habit of giving me goosebumps. \u000aBut I think to truly understand just how far they have come in evolution one would have to listen to "Fragments of Character". A layered and complex song such as that is quite the contrast to a wavy but solid composition such as this song. The fret-less bass is just so good. 
p1553
aVI totally have to agree. I really feel like they had set a precedent with Prehistoricism. Never before had I heard a band so fluidly blend stunning beauty with such raw aggression. The video for [Australopithecus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZYhDtg31Wc) (I felt) perfectly captured that emotion, too. And then Valley of Smoke. What an amazingly defining album. They held true to every aspect of creativity they'd developed even as far back as Void, but *still* brought so many new super creative ideas to the table. I should stop, I sound a little too fan boy.
p1554
aVI think we can all just agree that Intronaut is fucking awesome.

aVThat album cover and new font are horrid. At least the music was great.
p1577
aVIt's a very weird choice of cover artists. I remember from his portfolio, the artist has designed releases by Anberlin, Thrice, and Underoath. Not sure how they go from working with Aaron Turner for the debut to an artists that has seemingly no connection to their music.\u000a\u000aAnyway, tracks still sound like them (great), so I'm very excited to see Rosetta tomorrow.

aVYep. Totally agree. Much prefer their older album covers.
p1579
aVWasn't all of their art done by the singer before? Or was that just someone from Translation Loss?
p1580
aVWell, the art of Galilean Satellites was done by none other than [Aaron Turner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Turner), but their catalogue from then on I think is all Armine. Maybe not the splits they have done, but A Determinism of a Morality and Wake/Lift AFAIK are all Armine.

p1600
(lp1601
VNamed after Siberia\u2019s northernmost city, home of a famous metal smelting complex, Norilsk is a doom-death band from Gatineau (Québec), Canada. After releasing an EP, Japetus, in July 2014, Norilsk now unveils details about their debut album, \u201cThe Idea of North\u201d, out on March 10, 2015. \u000a\u000a\u201cThe Idea of North\u201d is a doom-death album crafted for the winter season: it has slow and crushing riffs, death growls, and atmospheric arrangements. An evocation of an ominous presence over a vast wasteland, \u201cThe Idea of North\u201d is a massive offering that triggers the imagination. Its music draws comparison with doom-death bands such as My Dying Bride, Morgion and Ablaze in Hatred, but it also has a few atmospheric sludge/post metal elements reminiscent of Isis and Morne.\u000a\u000aThe artwork was created by talented artist Sam Ford, who designed covers for many bands including Black Cobra, Witch Mountain, Monarch and Barrowlands.\u000a\u000aBassist and vocalist Nicolas Miquelon comments: \u201cWe wanted graphic art for this album cover, but we also wanted continuity with the visual theme developed on the EP. I knew about Sam Ford from his involvement with the Portland doom metal scene, and I had no doubt that his twisted imagination would be the perfect catalyst to re-interpret and expand Norilsk\u2019s initial concept. As this is Norilsk\u2019s first full length, we couldn\u2019t be happier to have Sam\u2019s signature on the album, as well as to have the support of two truly dedicated Canadian labels, Hypnotic Dirge Records and Dwyer Records.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Idea of North\u201d will be available in digipack CD, cassette, and digital. Based out of Saskatoon, the black metal, doom and atmospheric label Hypnotic Dirge will release the album in a glorious digipack edition, while the Ottawa-based sludge, hardcore and post-metal etiquette Dwyer Records will have the limited cassette edition.\u000a\u000aFull details about \u201cThe Idea of North\u201d to be revealed at a later date.\u000a

asVMy instrumental post-metal band just released it's first song!
p1639
(lp1640
VLove the banjo during the intro- really beautiful touch. I have some recommendations:\u000a\u000a1. Make sure you spend a ton of time humanizing the cymbal velocities. When the heavy part comes in it's very obvious that they're programmed. I usually do first hit in the bar 127, then every subsequent hit around 50-80, like a real drummer. If you're using Superior, select each of your cymbals and turn the MHE knob all the way up. It's designed to make sure the stick attack gets heard and generally increases the realism of repeated cymbal hits. \u000a\u000a2. Try utilizing a leading melody to segue into the heavy part, and from the heavy part into the spacey part. Toughest part about writing post-metal is making things sound coherent- i.e., enough musical glue- but not so streamlined as to be boring. You've got a bunch of delay-soaked guitar leads going, so take one of them and play a melody during the initial segue that leads into that big BOOOOOM low note. Any subdominant chord will do. \u000a\u000aOther than that, it sounds great! Really nice start. I think the songwriting/structure just need some tightening up. That's by far the toughest thing about making music in my experience. 
p1641
aVThanks for the feedback! Programming drums is definitely not a strength, but I've been putting a lot of work into it, and that should help a lot.\u000a\u000aI've been playing/writing more along the lines of thrash-death for the last bunch of years, so the textural/atmosphere-y stuff is a change of pace for me. This song was the first I'd written for the project, and the stuff I've demoed for the full length is easily leagues better in terms of songwriting and flow. As proud as I am of this song, I can't wait to get the next stuff out!
p1642
aVI really dug it. I look forward to hearing some more stuff!
p1643
aVThanks a ton! The split will be coming out in March (the other band is Cicada the Burrower, a killer post-black metal band), and I'm in the process of working on a full length for later this year.
p1644
aVI'm rarely impressed by a bands first release. This was really great though. Good tones and quality production are a big plus
p1645
aVThanks, I really appreciate it! It's funny that you mention the production because I had no idea what I was doing, but it ended up sounding pretty decent.
p1646
aVi have to agree. i didn't expect too much from the post title, but i've been playing the song 4 times in a row now
p1647
aVTo be honest, although this isnt quite in my musical taste, I actually really liked it.  I think you really have some talent and would love to see you get some good recognition.  The best of luck to you!\u000a\u000aAlso, what will be the price of the EP and how will you be releasing it? I would be all over that
p1648
aVThanks, that means a lot!\u000a\u000aAs for the upcoming release, it'll be released digitally for pay-what-you-want at https://mountainsoflight.bandcamp.com (the page isn't live yet, but will be shortly!), and we'll be doing a limited run of CDs for $5. I should be getting the test printing this week, and if all's good, it'll be released mid-March.

p1661
aVWell - I have noticed :) Besides it is the most obvious place where your music can improve. There is nothing 'wrong' with them. But they feel very basic/stock/uncreative **in comparison** to the melodies you have created. I think you should think about working with a live drummer, who might help you with breaking those beats...

aVI don't think linking to text off-site is a good way to start discussion. Posting it here creates a lot more discussion.

aVEither way, conveying your opinion by saying "Fuck your blog spam" certainly isn't a good way to get a discussion going.

aVConveying your opinion by posting blog spam isn't a good way to get discussion going, either.
p1742
aVThen you're just compounding the problem.  Slamming someone for something that really isn't even a big deal is just going to make people more hesitant to post anything.
p1743
aVWe don't exist to drive up the hits on someone's blog. Plain and simple. They can post the text here and provide a link to the blog in that text while also including any other relevant links about the new album.
p1744
aVSo downvote the post and politely suggest that they post the text here instead.  Flat-out attacking someone isn't going to accomplish anything but making this an unfriendly subreddit.
p1745
aVSorry, but not spamming your blog is pretty standard protocol, and they should know better.
p1746
aVConsidering your post was downvoted pretty hard, and this guy's post is getting upvotes, I think we can safely conclude that being an asshole is a more egregious offense to the community than linking to a blog.
p1747
aVWell, this is Reddit, where criticism is automatically downvoted to hell because this is most people's first forum.

aVI eventually opened two tabs and would skip the song I just listened to on the other tab since the issue was that it wouldn't play the next song. So stupid that I even had to do that.

p1842
aV&gt;They're metal that incorporates other genres of music and use synthesizers\u000a\u000aThat's not what post-metal is. I'm not even sure I would say that they have any metal in their sound.\u000a\u000a&gt;We could argue the definition of the genre but that's good enough for me because these labels are all just fluid and made up anyway. \u000a\u000aWhat? They're only fluid when you don't know how to define the genre. Your lack of knowledge doesn't make a genre's definition any different.

Your lack of knowledge doesn't make a genre's definition any different.\u000a\u000aYou act like there's some official organization making up these things. There isn't. There's no official definition of post-metal.

It has heavily distorted guitars and growl vocals. That is definitely metal style. Who is ignorant again? Why don't you know even what basic metal is?
p1844
aV&gt; You act like there's some official organization making up these things. There isn't. There's no official definition of post-metal. You didn't even bother to give your own definition. \u000a\u000aRight, so you think there's no agreed upon and widely used definition of post-metal and people can just use the term however they want even when it directly conflicts with other genres? Using your logic basically no modern genre has any official definition.\u000a\u000aPost-metal is pretty widely defined as being an evolution of atmospheric sludge that uses elements of post-rock. Roots go all the way back to Neurosis with bands like Isis solidifying it and their label actually using the term themselves.\u000a\u000a&gt;Did you even hear the song I posted? It has heavily distorted guitars and growl vocals. That is definitely metal style. Who is ignorant again? Why don't you know even what basic metal is?\u000a\u000aHeavily distorted guitars? Oh, so it's shoegaze, thanks for clearing that up.\u000a\u000aAnd what growling vocals? They use core vocals since they're a cybergrind band, a sub-genre of grindcore. I was listening to this band far before this album was out kiddo. These are not growling vocals.

VThe track overall is pretty nice.\u000aFrom a compositional perspective, your transition into the heavy part should probably be accompanied by bass and drums hits with that first heavy chord shot.  That's just my opinion though.  Carry the torch.  The more post-metal the merrier.
p1919
aVThanks for the feedback. Do you mean the first heavy chord, at 5:52 of the video when the guitarist switches channels from clean? If so, I think he just does it a bit early there but once recorded it's going to stay clean until he starts his solo. Right before that, I do the tremolo picking on G as a lead into the heavy part, and the drummer comes in with it,(like in the video) then we all go into the heavy part in unison while he starts the solo.

If you want to give that a try, i can give you a list of plugins i used (which programm you use for recording is more or less irrelevant since the vst plugins do most of the work!)\u000abtw glad you like my song, cheers!

p1967
aVHaha, awesome!
p1968
aVI think it should be more "escalating". I mean, the intro is pretty intense and it keeps going that way, it's very stable. I think it should have more "ups and downs", emotional changes and be more fluid. The outro though is exactly what I am talking about and it is very good. (sorry if am too judgemental, this is the kind of feedback I would be happy to hear myself about my songs)  
p1969
aVThanks for the feedback. I feel the same way a bit, but it just seemed to come out this way. I think that's something I struggle with when writing all of the music on my own, versus jamming with people. I'll try to add more change to future tracks.
p1970
aVNo man I did not mean that exactly, the point is to create what you feel. I believe that there are no limits or targets when creating. I just believe that it would be much better if the dynamics escalated to a breakdown even with the same notation and synthesis. Just to be more emotional and lead in a more clear way to the "hardest" part of the synthesis. Maybe with clean guitar in the intro and then escalate to distortion, or the "solo" guitar to result in playing the riff of the second. I don't know, that's what i would be doing (the beauty of music relies on that every mind is unique though) :)\u000aKeep creating man! Cheers
p1971
aVGood stuff, I'd buy an album like this.
p1972
aVI like it, has a good flow. I'm always impressed with solo bands. Question about the writing process, do you come up with the melody and guitar riffs first, or how do you do it? 
p1973
aVYeah, I normally just mess around on guitar, or possibly set up a basic drum beat in Pro Tools and try to come up with something. It's not really specific, but I do try to have a drum beat in mind when I'm messing around on guitar. The leads are almost always improvised though.

aVI have a cheap Audio Technica AT LP60. It's a decent player for a starter, specially on a budget. I don't have space for a proper set up right now, so I got the LP60 because it has a built in preamp so I can connect it to my computer and play the records that way. It's far from ideal but it works for me for now
p2003
aVI have an ION Profile LP.  I honestly don't know how good it is compared to other players, but it works for me.  It was $60 and comes with a cable that you can plug into it to record any LPs to your computer.  Of course, you can just hook up regular speakers to it as well.

p2063
aVGiant Squid, Russian Circles, and Kylesa aren't post-metal. I see where you're coming from with Russian Circles but they're not sludgy. They're just a metal influenced post-rock band. Either way not a bad gateway into this genre.\u000a\u000aLesser known: Lightbearer, Arktika, Carontte, Consiousness Removal Project, Downfall of Gaia (more so neo-crust but a lot of similarities there), Fall of Efrafa (Pre-Lightbearer, also neo-crust but fans of this genre tend to like it), North, Omega Massif, Rosetta, Sika Redem (not pure, they mix a lot of genres), Spook the Horses, Tidings.\u000a\u000aNot all of the stuff from my library but this is all of the stuff I know I like or remember liking without getting too far out there with genre boundaries.\u000a\u000aedit: I might be thinking of Grayceon when I think of Giant Squid. I always get them confused.
p2064
aVI still don't understand exactly what "post-metal" is. It confuses me even more that in an old man gloom interview Aaron Turner pretty much dismisses it entirely (unless the dude was joking). I do know that I enjoy most of the bands that fall into the genre. I just don't see how Isis or Rosetta would be post-metal while Russian Circles and Kylesa aren't.
p2065
aVEvery band in every genre dismisses that it exists or that they're in it. Very common in post-rock.\u000a\u000aKylesa is just sludge metal. I've already explained Russian Circles.\u000a\u000aBasically it's post-rock + sludge. Or just really atmospheric sludge.
p2066
aV"We don't use that label, &lt;insert genre label&gt;. We find it limiting and consider ourselves to be much more diverse  than &lt;insert genre label&gt; implies." -Every band ever\u000a\u000aThere's a El Ten Eleven interview where they basically say that and then to further distance themselves they go on to say, not only are they not post-rock, but they personally hate post-rock. Never cared for their music, but I had to laugh at that particular, um, marketing tactic.
p2067
aVI kind of get it. As a musician, you don't want to say, "I make &lt;insert genre name here&gt;." because it can limit your creative focus or your audience. Let the music speak for itself seems to be most people's answer. 
p2068
aVBingo. The genres are just for us  to make things easier to categorize and talk about. The bands really shouldn't care or worry. They should just create the art they want to create.
p2069
aVI think Empros is very post-metal. Enter not so much. Some bands you can't lump together into a genre. Like *shels. Laurentian's Atoll has a weirdly prog rock vibe to it for the first half the album even though most of their music is very post-metal. It's like Porcupine Tree met Atreyu met Zozobra.

p2084
aVI suppose you are right! Genre tags are so hard to define accurately these days... I would say that post metal includes sludgy aspects, as well as lots of melodic and atmospheric qualities. In terms of "post-metal" we lean on the slow, groove oriented, chuggy side of post-metal. That's what I meant mostly. Valid argument though! You obviously know your shit.

aVI would say both the endings of Cult of Luna's "Ghost Trail" and "Following Betulas" have that same feeling.

aV"Ghost Trail" live was one of the best experiences of my life. That song has a DOUBLE climax!\u000a
p2146
aVI haven't seen Cult Of Luna live. I imagine it must have been a really amazing, extremely well done experience?
p2147
aVThe single best light show I've ever seen, which added immensely to the music. Easily top 5...maybe top 3, but my top is cluttered with amazing experiences like Kayo Dot '05 and Sleep '10.

aVMost crushing band I've ever seen
p2149
aVwhen i saw them and they played that song, i had an out of body experience, and i was only mildly stoned and had 2 beers.  it was the most amazing 75 minutes of my life.
p2150
aVI mean, I don't know about in an all-time post-metal throwdown. But one of my favorites in the entire genre has got to be [Woundwort by Fall of Efrafa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA3VwvMOvrM). The song starts off normally enough for sludge, some big ol' riffs, but then the beginning of what eventually becomes the build-up comes around 8:09. The guitars drop away, and we're just left with a little bit of feedback, a simple drumbeat and a steady bassline. The next few minutes, it swells and swells until 11:34 hits and it feels simply transcendental
p2151
aVHad never heard this song (or band!) before. Holy shit, so good. 
p2152
aVFor me the most crushing ending is rosetta's [clavius] (http://youtu.be/hNXjjIhnHKQ) with an honorable mention to fall of efrafa's the warren of snares
p2153
aV[Rosetta - TMA3](http://rosetta.bandcamp.com/track/tma-3)\u000a\u000aMy personal favourite song by them. Explosive climax with tons of huge riffs.
p2154
aVSomehow I don't even think I've heard this one. For my money, climaxes don't get much better than ["Au Pays Natal"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meRrx4jgZzY), the closer from the greatest post-metal album ever made.

aVSecond. The best I can do is solo along in my way -__-.\u000a\u000aStill love it haha.
p2220
aVin my band, Alaskan, our guitarist comes up with a rough idea for a song (or sometimes an entire song), shows it to me (the drummer) and we work out the kinks.  he normally will have parts to the song, a rough idea of the order he wants them in and how he wants each part to "feel". we work together on the transitions, timing, tempos etc. typically, before i even get a chance to work with the song in front of my drums, i'm sent a rough bedroom recording of the guitar parts and i listen/air drum to those for as long as i need to (typically a few days). if i can't come up with anything, we go jam to see if actually watching him play makes a difference. it usually helps quite a bit.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aonce he and i are happy and finished with what we've come up with, we show our bassist and help him to learn the song.  we also give him his time with the song to add his own flare to it. eventually we play it live a few times to see how it feels and if it's good, we keep it. vocals are added along the way (our guitarist writes the vocals as well).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000ai'm in a few other non-post metal bands and the writing process is quite similiar. i'm not a fan of "just jamming" and hoping something comes of it. i've never really had much luck with that.
p2221
aVMy band has a similar process. Usually one of us will come up with 2 or 3 riffs/parts that sound good together, and then will make scratch recordings of it. From there it will be uploaded to an online dropbox that we can all access. \u000a\u000aFrom there the 3 of us will individually take the parts, and rearrange them, add to it, take stuff out as we would see it. We all upload our revised versions and then listen through at the next practice deciding what we like/don't like. Then we'll take to actually learning what we have so far as a band, and make adjustments as we play through it about 20 times in a row. \u000a\u000aI guess it's a little complicated but we don't get much time to practice so the more we can do outside of it, the better. 
p2222
aVman, i love the internet for reasons like the above. writing and recording is so damn easy.
p2223
aVReally helps being that everyone in my band works full time jobs. When it really comes down to it though, I think we can all agree that it usually starts with a riff. 
p2224
aVi agree for sure.\u000a\u000aus 3 all work full time jobs, run a record label and are in several other bands too (i'm in 5, our guitarist is in 7 and our bassist is in 3). we're busy.  cripes.

aVstart by guitar. start by picking some random unworkable idea (two notes in a bad rhythm or unpleasant noise) and then try and make it work as a riff. record it and about 15 variations. arrange them into something. \u000a\u000ashow up at practice, play it for people, see what they do with it. go from there.
p2230
aVIn my band we mostly jam on stuff.  One of us may start with a riff that we had come up with on our own with the rest of us joining in.  We usually record the jam which we then listen through and cut out the good parts or actually cut together a rough structure of a song.  This is then jammed upon again with another round of recording and cutting.  Some of the greatest stuff is done by accident so we always try and record the jams.
p2231
aVI am a vocalist in a post-metal band, and usually one of our guitar players comes up with a riff, and then they kinda weave everything around it, make it grow organically, although there are no written rules to it really
p2232
aVi'm not in a band but i'd be interested in how you drummers out there develop interesting and creative drum parts. i'm playing the drums for about 2 years now; i've been playing together with a few friends and i improvise to random songs on my ipod, BUT: after a while i find myself playing the same patterns over and over again. i'm trying to get as much creative input as possible, but when i'm out of ideas, it's always one of approximately five patterns that comes to my mind... how do you guys avoid this? and how long did it take you to find your personal note, your very own way of drumming?\u000a\u000aTL;DR: i'm a drummer with a lack of creativity. help me!

VI saw these guys live over a year ago with Black Tusk. I actually went to the show because I wanted to see a local band who was opening more than the headlining guys. I've never heard of East of the Wall before they got on stage and said who they were. For a venue which was basically a high school lunchroom style bar with a small ass stage in the back and maybe 40 people there, they put on a great show. Thank God for Spotify because I wouldn't be listening to them otherwise at this point.

p2273
aVThese guys are amazing.  Their last two albums were excellent, mashing all kinds of ideas up into songs that somehow always seem to make sense.  I'm lucky enough to live within 100 miles of them, so I've seen them as openers a few times in NYC - they've put the headliners to shame more than once.

p2324
aVI've never seen Pelican live, so maybe I'm missing something there, but on their studio stuff, I've never felt like the drummer was out of time.  That being said, I don't really like the drumming in Pelican; the last two albums in particular, I've felt like they've been far to forward in the mix and too simple to justify it.  The first two LPs were perfect: the drums were buried in the mix, kindy fuzzy even, made use of some creative percussion and quiet moments, and had sort of a bludgeoning aspect to them.  They really helped drive the songs.  Lately, they just sort of feel like a distraction from the guitars.

p2412
aVYou Europeans are jerks. Why is it taking them this long to press a US version?
p2413
aVBecause the band decided to release the album without a label and is financing it themselves, and whether they could press vinyl was dependent solely on the success of their "pay what you want" strategy for the digital album through Bandcamp.  They did say, however, that they were successful enough with BC to finance a vinyl, so it'll be coming out soon!

p2421
(lp2422
VSurprised no-one has mentioned [Deafheaven - *Sunbather*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfbLWHT7vUU) yet. I thought this was a fantastic album and it blew me away. I'm aware that everyone has been jumping on the hype train about this band, and possibly overhyping them in the process, but its still a phenomenal album.
p2423
aVIt's a fantastic album, but the post-black/blackgaze/dsbm (whatever you want to call it) style definitely isn't for everyone.\u000a\u000aIt would be high up on my list though.
p2424
aVTo be honest, everyone has been harking on about the black metal influence when in places arguably closer to 90s screamo (like [Orchid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpS_1Mx78S8) for example) than anything else.
p2425
aVThe vocal style is very much the same style as old screamo, but the melodies and general song structure are in my opinion a blend of Dsbm ([example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D89pz2hul8)),([another](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hAefXXgR4g))and a bit of shoegaze and even prog-rock to liven it up a bit.\u000a\u000aEvery review i've read for sunbather gives it a different genre description and i think that is a great thing for an album, it means it is less generic, something different and interesting. It is also acting as a gateway for new people to get into music more like black metal or post metal.\u000a\u000aWhen was the last time a black metal album was this well received by mainstream critics?
p2426
aVThe guitar sound itself has more direct lineage to Smiths era Johnny Marr than to shoegaze bands, or at least that aspect of the sound does. However I agree with your observations.
p2427
aVThe blast beats make it black metal.
p2428
aVGreat album but I cannot handle the sreamo vocal style as faceman2k mentioned.  The music is outstanding, but that scream irks the shit out of me.  No power behind it.  If they had a better vocalist the album would be on the list no doubt about it.  They need someone like Michael Armine from Rosetta or Loïc Rossetti from The Ocean doing the vocals.  Loïc Rossetti in particular would be a perfect fit as he seamlessly moves between clean and heavy vocals.  That would make for one hell of an album.
p2429
aVThe whole album was written by just the vocalist and the guitarist (the drummer merely played what they asked him to, adding a few tiny bits of personal flair into it, but not much), so getting a different vocalist would have changed the entire sound of the record. \u000a\u000aAs for lacking power, I see what you mean to an extent, and I think that was deliberate. I kind of thought that the vocals on this album were kept in the background, whilst the music was in the foreground, as opposed to the other way around which is standard in most music. Its an interesting approach and makes it less aggressive, which I guess fits to the general vibe of the album. Whether its for better or for worse is entirely down to opinion. I dig it personally.
p2430
aVAll solid points there.  I will probably give it another go at some point.  Musically it is outstanding.  Would have been a great instrumental only release.
p2431
aVThe Ocean is my favorite band, so hearing someone talk about Löic in high regards is always awesome to me. That being said, I think Deafheaven's vocals fit the style perfectly. As far as him not having any power, that's definitely in the mixing. He's not out front, and that's hardly new, Tool has been doing that for years. The dude from Deafheaven is actually one of the most powerful frontmen I've ever seen. He screams with such intensity that even when his mouth is two feet away from the microphone it is still resonating over the band. That's just my opinion though. \u000a\u000aThe Ocean all day everyday though! Are you gonna hit up their headlining tour in March?
p2432
aVRight on with The Ocean.  Brilliant band.  One of the best bands on the planet in any genre.\u000a\u000aAs for the singer for Deafheaven, it isn't just about the mix, it is the style.  He has a sort of screechy, screamo style that is annoying.  It might just be a preference/tone thing.  I prefer more of a throaty growl.  Jens Kidman, Aaron Turner, Johannes Persson, Löic, etc etc ...nothing screechy with any of those guys.  They are intense and their tone fits the music.
p2433
aVI feel what you're saying. I'm very picky with my black metal vocals. I hate most highs as I feel they fit your exact description, but I feel Deafheaven's is one of the few I like. You should check out Altar of Plagues' album Mammal. It's a post-metal/black-metal hybrid with a totally different vocal style. I love that album. 
p2434

aVScreamo? It's black metal vocals.
p2436
aV90s screamo is very different to modern day screamo. Effectively separate entities all together. [Orchid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpS_1Mx78S8) are my go to example to explain what I mean. You'll understand what I mean once you get past the 1:40 mark.
p2437
aVI know Orchid. I'm aware of 90s screamo. They still don't sound like that.
p2438
aVIt hasn't been mentioned because it's not a post-metal album. Also, it's on Bandcamp, no need to include a YT link.
p2439
aV*Sunbather* is a terrific album, one of the best from last year, but it's clearly not post-metal.. There's no sludge in it, no real grittiness.
p2440
aVSolid list. I've heard and agree with the first five and the Pelican album, and I just added the other four to my list of things to listen to. That Sannhet album starts out pretty strong.\u000a\u000aAnd thanks for informing me that Rosetta released a new record this year! The Galilean Satellites is one of my favorite records, and I really enjoy Rosetta's music. I had no idea they released anything recently.

p2443
aVThis album deserves way more attention than its getting. My number 2 for the year for any genre.

p2445
aVBut that's a post-black metal album.

aVpost black metal is still post metal. Having stupidly arbitrary genre definitions makes you sound like a pretentious ass.\u000a\u000ap.s. read the sidebar
p2449
aV&gt; post black metal is still post metal. \u000a\u000aWhat? They're completely different genres.\u000a\u000aPost-metal is sludge metal + post-rock. Post-black metal is the general term to refer to BM that's mixed with shoegaze, post-rock, and post-punk. Though people do like to use "blackgaze" to refer specifically to the shoegaze + BM style.\u000a\u000a&gt;Having stupidly arbitrary genre definitions makes you sound like a pretentious ass.\u000a\u000aSorry, just because you don't know how genres are defined, doesn't make them arbitrary.
p2450
aVIn the venn diagram of those genres there is a huge amount of crossover so no they are not completely different. These terms are fluid and don't adhere to the same rigidity as a math equation. You're being pedantic and seriously, read the damn sidebar.
p2451
aV&gt;In the venn diagram of those genres there is a huge amount of crossover\u000a\u000aNo, there isn't. One genre is black metal based and the other is sludge metal based.\u000a\u000a&gt;These terms are fluid and don't adhere to the same rigidity as a math equation.\u000a\u000aYes, they are fluid, but they still have meaning. You want it to be so fluid as to combine completely different genres. I'm simply pointing out that while "post-metal" can be a lot of things it *is not* black metal.\u000a\u000a&lt;I&gt;You're being pedantic and seriously, read the damn sidebar.&lt;/i&gt;\u000a\u000aYou mean the sidebar that specifically mentions post-black metal as another genre?
p2452
aVMy favourite album of 2013 is actually one no one has mentioned, and that album is Palms by Palms. This album was really awesome, especially the song "Shortwave radio"
p2453
aVthat was such a let down for me. such a let down.
p2454
aVI can see why, since it not something that you really expected of the guys from ISIS, and when I first heard "Future Warriror", I was far from impressed. But it got stuck in my head, so I listened to it again. And then again. And I just started loving the whole album more and more.
p2455
aVI tried man, I really did. Isis and Chino? I just can't get into it at all. Crosses on the other hand I love. Dunno.
p2456
aVWell I might have had a perk because I've never heard of Chino or Deftones. Do you have any for songs by Crosses. Listned a bit and kind of enjoyed it
p2457
aVI do somewhere. And how have you never heard the Deftones? lol, that's crazy. They are one of those bands who gets more amazing with each album.
p2458
aVNice! Got any tips for Deftones and Crosses?
p2459
aVDeftones I'd say start at the beginning man. Listen to them all, listen to them grow, almost fall apart around Saturday Night Wrist, then get their shit together and put out the most amazing albums of their careers. Koi No Yokan, their new album is amazing. It's seriously an opus, I love every song on it. I've been listening to them since 1997, and I have to say that I really think they are the best group doing music right now. Crosses, start at the beginning, they are still new enough there isn't as much to wade through. I hope that helps. Take care.

aVNo love for Light Bearer?\u000a\u000aIMO Intronaut has really moved away from sounding anywhere near post-metal. Solid list though. Sannhet is the only one I haven't listened to.
p2464
aVYes love! [Light Bearer \u2013 Silver Tongue](http://lightbearer.bandcamp.com/album/silver-tongue-2) is my definite favorite album of the year, maybe of the century even.
p2465
aVAgree with this. Intronaut's album is spectacular, imo. Going to have to hear the rest a few more times too.\u000a\u000aI notice MoTA at number 4. Dawning was certainly a good album. Interestingly though, I haven't listened to it again because I like their old stuff so much more. In fact, The Ties that Blind might be my favorite metal album *ever*. Should I give Dawning another chance?
p2466
aVDefinitely give Dawning another go.  Brilliant album.  Ties is fantastic no doubt about it, but Dawning just feels like a perfect representation of where they are as a band right now.  Sounds amazing live as well.
p2467
aVDawning is my favorite album from them. I think adding in the clean vocals to every track really brings their sound to a whole new level as it gives them a new dynamic to work with.
p2468
aVMOVE SANNHET UP!
p2469
aVListened to about half of the album and it is pretty good. Lots of competition this year though.
p2470
aV[deleted]
p2471
aVIf they come by your town you might be able to buy one for an affordable price, I remember their vinyls and cds being a little more expensive than other artists' though I might understand that given all the shit they have been through (getting robbed by fake policemen when they were driving through my city is one example).
p2472
aVProud to say that I saw 3 of the bands live last year : Pelican, Cult of Luna and Russian Circles. 
p2473
aV* Rosetta- The Anaesthete\u000a\u000a* YONL-Tocsin (this one blew me away, even without vocals I love it)\u000a\u000a* The Old Wind- Feast on your gone\u000a\u000aThat's my list. I listen to a lot of other stuff too, so those are what stuck out most for me in this genre. \u000a\u000a
p2474
aVThat The Old Wind album is great.  Thanks for that.
p2475
aVyou're welcome. the guy who is the "brains" behind them is the former vocalist of Breach, another killer doom/post band. 
p2476
aVYeah reading about them now.  That guy did everything on the album apparently.  Breach is pretty legendary.  Glad i happened upon this.\u000a\u000aThe last album that made me nod my head through the whole thing on first listen this much was Howl and Filth by Generation of Vipers.  That's not a 2013 release but I'm reminded of it when listening to this one.  Bit more of an American vibe with them being American.  I guess that makes sense.
p2477
aVyeah it does. I heard of The Old Wind via The Ocean's facebook page, apparently one of them is a touring member of them. I like how bleak it sounds, it's like his own personal hell. 
p2478
aVNice list.  Looks like I have some listening to do tomorrow.  
p2479
aVThat'd be my top 10 list except for that Intronaut album which I never really liked. Prehistoricisms is one of my favorite post metal albums, but this one didn't really appeal to me.
p2480
aVGlad I'm not the only one who feels this way. I don't even think they sound post-metal anymore. It's much closer to alt. rock fused with some generic sludgy sound. People shouldn't like bands just because they put out one good album earlier.
p2481
aVLocrian, anyone? I loved that album.
p2482
aVThat album was really hit or miss for me. It had some great songs but the more repetitive krautrock parts were hard to sit through.
p2483
aVGood list.\u000aBut I would consider Inter Arma's "Sky Burial" as well.
p2484
aVAm I the only one that wasn't that impressed with the new Rosetta? Some combination of the production and songwriting left it feeling very generic for me, like they were just covering ground they'd already done. None of the songs jumped out at me and while I like all their albums, they've always been somewhat of a "song" band to me- classics like Ayil, Departe, or Revolve are what keep me coming back. Almost nothing memorable for me on the Anaesthete. Still will catch them live the next time they play though, that's one aspect of the band that will never change for me- their intense live energy\u000a\u000aOtherwise, I mostly agree with this list, as well as commenters mentioning the new ones by Light Bearer and Deafheaven- two records that definitely beat out Rosetta or The Ocean for me this year
p2485
aVI felt like the first song was a re-tread but then after that the album has a lot of new stuff. So it just doesn't start off on the best note. I disagree about the song thing. Release/Revolve/Renew work best back to back. The Galilean Satellites seems like a single journey through space. Especially when you're listening to the combined version.
p2486
aVEveryone here should check this album out: http://shelsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/erlen-meyer\u000a\u000aGreat French post-metal album and one of my favorite albums of the year.
p2487
aVI really can't disagree with 1-6, all of those were on my top 10 and I saw 5 of those bands last year and every show was mind blowing (especially Cult of Luna, probably the best show I've been to)
p2488
aVdon't forget about year of no light - vampyr and pray for teeth's from the dry edge of the shore.\u000a\u000a2013 was a good year for music, especially heavy music.

aVPalms....?
p2491
aVPalms really didn't do anything for me.  Was kind of a bummer.  Three ex members of Isis + Chino seemed like a helluva combination but I was kind of underwhelmed.  The album definitely isn't post-metal.  Not entirely sure you could even classify it as post-rock.  Honestly sounds more like post-pop.  Not a knock on the band at all just not really a style I enjoy.

asVListened to Pelican for the first time. This stuff is awesome! What are some fundamental postmetal bands/albums that I should seek out to really get into this genre.
p2579
(lp2580
V[deleted]
p2581
aVplus Cult of Luna. Those are the big three.
p2582
aVIf we include Neurosis, then we must include Amenra too.
p2583
aVIn addition to Pelican, my go-to post-metal bands are Russian Circles and Cloudkicker. Cloudkicker is by far my favorite though. My favorite album of his is [Beacons](http://cloudkickermusic.com/album/beacons).
p2584
aVAfter many years of listening to Pelican every day I am now OBSESSED with cloudkicker
p2585
aVRussian Circles.  Yes.
p2586
aVKeep exploring Pelican, for one. I've never listened to any other band more than I have them. Note though that they are closer to post-rock than post-metal. Then, maybe give [Russian Circles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMHkYijJW3M) a try, maybe some [Red Sparowes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZizMmubcF54) too. \u000a\u000aEDIT: Seems I'm the only one that read your post. These are all instrumental bands.
p2587
aVOther than the big three (Neurosis, Isis, and Cult of Luna), the second tier is Rosetta and Callisto. Then, if you want to keep going, there's Burst (more progressive), Crib45 (sounds like CoL/Callisto, their newest is *excellent*), Huldra (sounds like later Isis), Intronaut (prog/jazzy), Irreversible, North, Sarin (sounds like earlier Isis), and Year of No Light. \u000a\u000aAll of these have vocals, I don't like instrumental post-metal, and am honestly not a big fan of the Pelican/Russian Circles strand either. I just think of them as slightly heavier post-rock. 
p2588
aVIsis - Oceanic and Through Silver in Blood, Times of Grace and Eye of Every Storm by Neurosis. 
p2589
aVYou might like Set and Setting from St. Petersburg, Florida.  I know them personally, they're good dudes and write good post-metal/postrock.  They singed a deal with Prosthetic Records last year.\u000a\u000ahttps://setandsetting.bandcamp.com/\u000a\u000aEDIT:  \u000aalso these guys are from the Tampa Bay Area.  They tend to be more melodic postrock, but the track I linked to has a heavier sort of feel.  \u000a\u000ahttps://redroomcinema.bandcamp.com/track/shadows-of-a-forgotten-city
p2590
aVAgreed on the Isis "Panopticon" and "Oceanic".\u000a\u000aI've also been listening to [If These Trees Could Talk](http://ifthesetreescouldtalk.bandcamp.com/album/red-forest).
p2591
aVAs others mentioned: Cloudkicker, Russian Circles, ISIS for sure.  On the more progressive side, I'm really digging Miroist.  Will also throw out Sisters of... (full disclosure, I run the label they are on).  Those are all mostly instrumental.  With vocals... Rosetta, and Bossk are sure to please.  
p2592
aVTwo great post-metal bands that haven't been mentioned yet.\u000a\u000aYear of No Light - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhnkD7YxJ1s\u000a\u000aTempel - http://tempelofficial.bandcamp.com/\u000a\u000aAlso, if you haven't ventured into the post-rock territory yet, you probably should. There's a lot of similar sounding stuff there, like Explosions in the Sky, Boards of Canada, Caspian, etc., but it's obviously less chunky sounding.
p2593
aVThanks for the reply. I'm a big fan of Explosions and I FUCKING LOVE Caspian.
p2594
aVI think I've found a new favorite genre at a time when I really need it. Thanks, guys!
p2595
aVIf you want something instrumental and monolithic, try Omega Massif and Year Of No Light. If something more similar to regular metal, Amenra are legendary, have vocals. As their idols Neurosis.
p2596
aVIts already been said a buncha times... Neurosis, Isis, Cult of Luna, Amenra, Rosetta. Those are the very definition of the genre. For more instrumental stuff, check out Red Sparowes. And I've been listening to The Ocean a bunch lately, too... And a band from France called As We Draw, except they are more hardcore than post-metal. 
p2597
aVKudos on mentioning As We Draw ,theyre a sick band

p2602
aVAnimals as Leaders should be mentioned here, I believe.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Spelling.
p2603
aVDef... Animals as Leaders is solid if you're looking for something faster and more progressive.  Check out their video for "Cafo" if you want a taste: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfzWpp0hMc

p2617
aVOkay.  For some reason every time I've tried to get into Russian Circles I came away feeling unimpressed, but this is pretty god damned awesome.  Is this sound a change in direction for them, or have I always been finding the worst of their songs to check out?
p2618
aVIt's more immediately heavy than a number of their songs, but I certainly wouldn't call it a change in direction. Give their albums a listen, you might be surprised.

p2648
aVI can listen to Itinerant over and over for hours and not get tired of it
p2649
aVSame here. I have listened to that song probably near a thousand times in my life. The whole album? Maybe a dozen haha.
p2650
aVIll post mine, and yes i know this is very hard to anwser, haha.\u000aIt's not impossible i will forget some songs here.\u000a  \u000a\u000a**ISIS - Grinning Mouths:**  \u000a  \u000a*The song that got me into post metal, I've always been a metal head but could never put a name on this style of metal before. Even tho, shockingly i had seen Cult of Luna and Burst live about 2 times before that.*  \u000a   \u000a\u000a**Cult of luna - Vicarious Redemption / Cult of luna - Mute Departure:**\u000a\u000a*My favourites of the Vertikal album, both songs have an amazing payoff after the build up. And most other CoL songs aswell but i felt like mentioning these.*\u000a    \u000a\u000a\u000a**Pelican - Drought:**  \u000a\u000a*One of my favourite heavy ball crushing riff songs. I wish i knew more of these kind of songs. The Album Ghost by Buried at Sea reminds me of this song, and that is also a great album!*\u000a\u000a  \u000a\u000a**Rosetta - Europa/Wake/A Determinism Of Morality:**\u000a\u000a*Rosetta are probably one of my favourite post metal bands, along side with ISIS and CoL. Atmosphere is a big thing for me in music, and i think Rosetta build an amazingly thick atmosphere and that's why i like them so much*\u000a\u000a**Amenra - Boden (vinyl version):**  \u000a  \u000aI like all of Amenra's songs equally, As goes for every one of these bands ofc. Amenra delivers a real authentic feeling of pain, Wich almost touches you through the speakers. The vocalist here is amazing and one of my favourites to date!  \u000a  \u000aThis was written from start to finish so i am certain i forgot to name some songs that i would have wanted to include. \u000a
p2651
aVHow good is Vertikal. I think it's CoL's best yet. \u000a\u000aMy go-to track is ISIS, In Fiction. It's the one that got me into this whole crazy thing and it still slays. 
p2652
aVISIS is that band to a lot of people.
p2653
aVI always forget about Pelican because I find them mostly underwhelming, but that one song..."March Into The Sea" - whichever version is 20 minutes long. That song is *awesome*. 
p2654
aVDrought is the song that got me into post metal.
p2655
aV[Buried Inside - Time as Imperialism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnd5q3Feui0)\u000a\u000aThis is one of the first Post Metal groups I got into. This album is best played through in entirety, and the theme regarding time and how it controls all aspects of life was really powerful and unique IMO. The lyrics are a bit pretentious, but still really thought provoking:\u000a\u000a&gt; The calendar year is an imperial narrative. The seven-day week is an imperial infliction. Circannual holidays are imperial flag-posts. Mechanical time is an imperial installation. The merchant workday is an imperial offering. Greenwich MeanTime is an imperial sanction. The looming weight, uniformly imposed; as albatross and as anchor. The new time-imperialists will get their way with those left: the rural, the feral, the frail. Feed them a thread, that leads to a string. They'll follow the string, until it leads to a rope, and from that rope every vestige of what was will be hung by the neck.
p2656
aVHaven't hear this band before, gonna play the album from start to finish. thanks!\u000a\u000aI finished it, incredible album, thanks for sharing.\u000aI said to myself on the last song, i hope they finish strong, and they fuckin sure did! 
p2657
aVI'll try to list some that haven't already been mentioned:\u000a\u000a -\u000a\u000a[Fall of Efrafa - The Warren of Snares](http://youtu.be/18AiWl0zjZQ)\u000a\u000aThis is perhaps my favorite song of all time. It's an epic post-metal/crust hybrid that concludes a concept trilogy of albums about bunny rabbits. What's not to love?\u000a\u000a -\u000a\u000a[Battle of Mice - At the Base of the Giant's Throat](http://youtu.be/C1CkdF7uoKk)\u000a\u000aI like this one because it makes me very uncomfortable.\u000a\u000a -\u000a\u000a[Cloudkicker - The warmth of the daytime seemed like a dream now / A weather front was stalled out in the Pacific\u200b-\u200b-\u200blike a lonely person, lost in thought, oblivious of time](http://youtu.be/RhkRbZ5sf3M)\u000a\u000aThis is actually two songs, but they belong together. Cloudkicker is definitely one my my favorite bands, but I don't think I can really articulate what it is that makes it so awesome.\u000a\u000a -\u000a\u000a[Russian Circles - 309](http://youtu.be/JtpFOBJA7O8)\u000a\u000aIt has nice structure and texture.\u000a\u000a -\u000a\u000a[Blindead - Affliction XXVII II MMIX](http://youtu.be/VBCYnKooC-I)\u000a\u000a[Ocoai - Breatherman](http://youtu.be/UjNJ1Uc1BVc)\u000a\u000a[North - Ghosts Among Us](http://youtu.be/DCKeyhDY4JA)
p2658
aVMouth of the Architect - Wake Me When It's Over. I don't think I've ever replayed a song so many times. I can't really explain it.\u000a\u000aGiant Squid - Metridium Fields. Baroness - Wailing Wintry Wind.\u000a\u000aAmong other things already posted here. I could gush for pages about ISIS.\u000a\u000aAlso, this song by a band called Throne of Mars: http://throneonmars.bandcamp.com/track/pathfinder
p2659
aVWay to post an overwhelmingly huge question. I tend to respect post-metal in album form more than song form, but I'll try to answer the question as posed.\u000a\u000aThe "why" for most of these is "because it's awesome", but what makes post-metal awesome to me is either excellent build-up and climax, or uniqueness and creativity deviating from the "typical" post-metal song format. \u000a\u000a**Creativity:**\u000a\u000a* Burst "(We Watched) The Silver Rain", "City Cloaked"\u000a\u000a* Callisto "Wormwood", "Latterday Saints", "Pathos"\u000a\u000a* Cult of Luna "Sleep", "Owlwood", "Ghost Trail", "Vicarious Redemption"\u000a\u000a* Inter Arma "'sblood", "The Cavern"\u000a\u000a* Irreversible "Sins", "Iblis", "Synaesthesia"\u000a\u000a* Rosetta "A Determinism of Morality", "Départe", "Itinérant", "Au Pays Natal", "Monument", "TMA-1", "Clavius"\u000a\u000a* Word as a Virus "Avoid the Light", "Farewell to Sanctity", "Heroin", "The Diamond Sea"\u000a\u000a**Epic buildup/heaviness:**\u000a\u000a* Crib45 "Borderlines", "Into the Abyss"\u000a\u000a* Cult of Luna "Echoes", "Finland", "Dim", "Dark City, Dead Man"\u000a\u000a* Huldra "Ursidae", "The City in the Sky"\u000a\u000a* Isis "Celestial (The Tower + Signal Fills the Void)", "Holy Tears", "The Beginning and the End", "False Light", "So Did We", "In Fiction", "Syndic Calls"\u000a\u000a* Neurosis "Given to the Rising", "At the Well", "My Heart for Deliverance", "Through Silver in Blood", "The Doorway"\u000a\u000a* Potmos Hetoimos "The Crumbling Dam/Avalanche", "Pulpit Despotism"

p2663
aVCult of luna - pretty much anything from salvation and SWATH because of the lyrics. Really can't choose a best song of theirs, I love these albums in every way \u000a\u000aRosetta - Wake is an absolute beast of a song on so many levels\u000a\u000aMouth of the architect - hate and heartache - best intro to a song ever, first half of the track makes me weak

aVThat Junius EP is truly mind-blowing.

p2779
aVHah!  You might have some competition.  Though I did just recently reset [my profile](http://www.last.fm/user/EIDMAR), because I'm a masochist I guess, but I listen to a ton of Junius.
p2780
aVMayhaps!  I am at 6,392 plays of Junius in the last 2.5 years I've been on Last.FM. 
p2781
aVDamn.  This is why I need to just stick with one profile.  I'm at...83?  I have a little catching up to do.
p2782
aVMy first profile had over 100k plays, and then I was like delete, and I have regretted every since.  Not sure why we like climbing numbers, imaginary scores so much, as a human race.
p2783
aVIt appeals to our desire to feel as if we've accomplished something.  Like listening to a hundred thousand songs.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't care about my last.fm scrobbles.  It's ridiculous, but it bothers me to listen to music without scrobbling.\u000a\u000aHaving just typed that...wow, that's really sad.
p2784
aVNah, that isn't sad.  I feel the same way.  Some people care about how many likes they get on Facebook, some people care about how many scrobbles they have on Last.FM. Too each their own.

aVI may have looked at your post history, and noticed you're from Salt Lake.  With that knowledge, I have to ask - have you heard of [Huldra](http://huldratheband.bandcamp.com/album/monuments-monoliths)?  Amazing ambient post-metal from SLC.  Really great dudes, and one of my favorite bands.  They've got a new album coming out later this year.

aVCan't believe I forgot about Red Sparowes.... Those guys are amazing! And really cool people, too. The GF and I saw them when they were touring their first album, and we hung out and talked to them after the show. About a year later, they came back thru opening for Russian Circles. We went over to the merch table, and they remembered us! Super cool people, appreciates their fans.

p2836
aVMore djent/progressive metal than straight up post-metal, but Tesseract's last album is amazing, and the vocals are beyond clean.  The singer's voice is incredibly good.  I find it scratches the same itch for me that a lot of post-metal does.  Maybe you'll be into it.  [Tesseract's "Resist"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwBdKC4EwSs) is a good starting place.

p2838
aV[*shels](https://shelsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/sea-of-the-dying-dhow) are a fantastic band and they use growls **very** sparingly (first track on that album has them.)\u000a\u000aNot really post-metal, but with elements of, Sólstafir's later albums have [no growls anymore](https://solstafir.bandcamp.com/track/n-or).\u000a\u000aIf you're simply not into harsh vocals, there are lots of instrumental post-metal bands, as suggested by others. I'd also recommend [Tempel](https://tempelofficial.bandcamp.com/track/rising-from-the-abyss), [Omega Massif](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLPJmgi6nDA), Year of no Light's [Tocsin](https://soundcloud.com/noisey/year-of-no-light-stella), [Stories from the Lost](https://dunkrecords.bandcamp.com/track/the-haze-ii) and [Heirs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4kjCdcBLws).

p2853
(lp2854
VI think Subsume is my favorite Cloudkicker album. I actually didn't even like it when I first heard it. It really took quite a few listens to grow on me, but I'm glad I stuck with it. Subsume has the emotion of Let Yourself Be Huge, with the heaviness of Beacons, and then a nice mix post metal/post rock/post whatever. "He would be riding on the subway..." begins with the same riff looped over and over again, each time building a new lay of subtle guitar. It repeats for over four minutes before finally crescendoing, but then the song builds up again, and hits you in the face. Man, I really love that song, and that album

aVWow, they've matured. Pretty awesome.
p2937
aVIt's taken me a while to get into this band, but the thing that sticks out for me is that these guys have a 'sadder' sound than most post metal bands.  I like.\u000a\u000aAlso, I was listening to the *The Violence Beneath* EP and I wondered why someone would name their song 'In Your Eyes' when Peter Gabriel already did that.  I listened to the first half of the song before I realized that it was a cover.  How many post metal covers are there of well, anything?  Cool stuff.  
p2938
aVHa, I fucking love that cover.  I wasn't even paying attention to the tracklist as I first listened to it, but about halfway through I'm thinking "wait a second...this is kinda familiar."  It's honestly one of my favorite songs by them\u000a\u000aThe only other post-metal cover I can think of off the top of my head is [Rosetta - Homesick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAzXH9k-p0Y).

I'm in total agreement with you and have always wanted our sub to be welcoming to everyone, not just a sub for those well versed in the genre. The power of our communities is in the sharing of what we love, the discussions that take place and the learning more about the genres. Be passionate about them, just don't be a dick. :) \u000a\u000aKeep doing what you do - Cheers!\u000a

p2951
aVThat's why I brought it up with dasFisch.  I've been moderators of things before and in my younger years I'd been banhappy but I've grown up and reeeeeeally tried to give this guy as many extra chances as I could.  In the end, I feel his presence caused the effect you just mentioned; some people might hesitate to post new bands because it might not be 100% post-metal and people didn't want to get ripped on for it.\u000a\u000aBesides, what *is* 100% post-metal these days??

aVI saw them play this at Roadburn. It would be so much better if they had the female vocals live too. From what I've seen on youtube, this have never been the case.
p2992
aVI've seen them a few weeks ago in Leuven (STUK) and it was just amazing!\u000a\u000abig part of it was just the experience, the atmosphere: A dark room, filled with smoke and the scent of incense (wierrook) just made it so much more intense. Then the amazing sound there made it a whole, allround spectacle.\u000a\u000aAlso the crowd there was mostly their fans, so every song everybody was slowly headbanging along the music, feeling it, getting startled by it. At one moment I was almost in tears, because it was one of the most intense things I ever experienced.\u000a\u000aAll these things combined made that the second best show I ever saw, and it will always stay in my mind. JAW DROPPING. Hearing that they are doing loads and loads of festivals kind of makes me sad, because I think everyone should have the chance to see them in their full glory, in the right place, right atmosphere right soundsystem. Those are things that -no offense- are not (or very difficult) achievable at festivals. And for that amigo: go see them in a club, it will blow you mind.\u000a\u000a[EDIT]: Forgot about the cinematics! They are just BANG ON! While they play, black/white film is projected behind them and it really hits the right spot!\u000a\u000atl;dr: Go see them in a club rather than mid day on a festival. With the right atmosphere the experience is SO MUCH MORE INTENSE.
p2993
aVOh don't get me wrong. The show at roadburn was really intense. It was the last show on the friday night. It was in the het patronaat which is a small church. This made it more awesome. I do love the black and white visuals also. All I'm saying is that  the song would be at its best live with the inclusion of the female vocals.

p3005
aVNever, I'm afraid. But here's hoping they manage to hit up Baltimore someday!
p3006
aVI'm hoping they'll start doing shows out of state soon, but two of them are in other touring bands (SubRosa and Visigoth) which takes away a lot of their time, unfortunately.  I'll be interested to see what happens after they release this album.  As it is now, things seem to be kind of on the back-burner, with just the occasional show here and there when everyone is in town for a while.

aVExactly this. City Of Echoes and What We All Come To Need. Just didn't do it for me. Not to mention atrocious drumming.
p3080
aVCity of Echoes and What We All Come To Need were solid albums, but nothing really stood out from them. Whenever I want to listen to Pelican, I never think of them.
p3081
aVStrange, City of Echoes is usually a go-to album, for me. Then again, when I heard Mammoth off of their self-titled demo, all I could think was "God DAMN Pelican used to be heavy!"

sVLet's try adding a little discussion to this subreddit...What song/band/show got you into the genre?
p3199
(lp3200
VRosetta. Ayil. I had copied the album to my sansa from my cousin's computer one day. Eventually listened to it, and was sold on the first song. A true masterpiece of an album!
p3201
aVIsis - so did we, and the Neurosis album 'A Sun that Never Sets'. Been hooked ever since. Got it through a buddy of mine who plays in Ocoai - you should check them out, they have a lot of good tunes and tons of potential.
p3202
aV[deleted]
p3203
aVIsis, specifically "The Pliable Foe."  I first heard it on Adult Swim's Metal Swim comp, and listened to it practically on loop for the longest time.  I don't think a single song has ever redefined my taste in music as much as that one.
p3204
aVIsis - Celestial (The Tower).  I found it on a Myspace profile a few years ago.  The intro caught my attention, and how Turner's voice layered into the song kept me interested.  After that I slowly bought every Isis album, and recently have broadened my range to other bands.  \u000a\u000aWhen I think back, it was an interesting discovery process.  In my teenage years I obsessed over lyrics and singing along, but when I listened to Isis, I didn't care.  About two or three years after I had started listening to Isis, I became curious what the lyrics were and then learned about the concepts behind each album.  It gave me chills.  It was like I rediscovered the band.
p3205
aVI saw Isis on Tool's 10,000 Days tour. From that day I was forever hooked.
p3206
aVWas that right around when In The Absence of Truth came out?  I saw that tour.  Really awesome of Tool to take on a relatively unknown band like Isis - though I don't think most of the Tool fans really appreciated the.
p3207
aVYea, the fall of 2006 IIRC. None of my friends who went with me thought Isis were that good. It took me a good 2 years of shoving Isis down their throats to get them to understand what I heard that day. 
p3208
aVRelatively unknown? You do know Aaron Turner's relevance beyond Isis, right?
p3209
aVI am fairly sure it was Cult of Luna - Back to Chapel Town that did it for me. I came from post-rock, and it instantly hit me. Then I dowe into the genre and fell in love with Isis. Nowadays post is pretty much the only metal genre I listen to, as I've widen up my musical spectrum a lot.
p3210
aVCult of Luna's album "Salvation" did it for me. Album is so fantastic from a musical and production perspective, I think it's probably one of my favorite *sounding* albums of all time.
p3211
aVRosetta. I was a fan of Isis, Neurosis and Godflesh, but I was stunned by the beauty of Wake. I was kind of naive and it was the first time I had heard something so immense and heavy but without aggression.
p3212
aVLove this thread.\u000a\u000aMy first was Pelican's "March To The Sea". I saw them supporting Thrice on a tour back in 08 I think and they just blew me away both nights. Seen them every time at the Troubadour in LA since then.
p3213
aV[Neurosis - eye.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5ou0UFklR0)  I heard it on college radio when through silver in blood came out. Then saw them open for Pantera and was blown away.\u000a\u000aAlso I feel old posting with what everyone else is posting.
p3214
aVI actually had no idea Neurosis ever played with Pantera.  That's awesome.  Pantera's still one of my all time favorites.
p3215
aVdude I was like 15 or 16 so I was pretty young, but it was great. The crowd really didn't get neurosis. I remember only seeing two songs and one was through silver in blood.
p3216
aV&gt;and one was through silver in blood\u000a\u000aThat's fucking awesome. \u000a\u000aUnrelated to post metal, but funny: I've twice seen strangers right in front of me at concerts turn to each other after the set and say "What the fuck did we just see?" (Because they were astounded by how different it was, not intolerant. ) The bands in question where Kylesa and Blood Ceremony. 
p3217
aVI think I was listening to Post-metal before I knew what it even was. Pretty sure I started on Cult of Luna (though it's hard to be sure), but being a fan of bands like Queens of the Stoneage from my mid teens, I hit the sludge pretty hard and had got into doom/drone like Sunn O))) before I'd properly explored the rest that post-metal has to offer. Had to to double back on myself!\u000a\u000aBut yeah, so Cult of Luna, Isis, Pelican, Russian Circles were all sort of the first bands of the style I got into.
p3218
aVNot sure if this counts but the first time I heard "farewell" by Boris as well as 'Drought' by pelican was what did it for me.  Unfortunately I have not had the chance to see many PM bands live but Im always on the lookout.

aVI might be alone here but post metal bands aren't always the most exciting bands to see live.  It's generally such moody, atmospheric music that all you can really do is stand there while slowly nodding your head.\u000a\u000aBut then again I'm the kinda guy who likes to jump into mosh pits at metal shows, so that may be why I don't get quite as much enjoyment out of post metal shows.
p3220
aVI usually stay out of the pits.  I used to be a danger to others but as Ive gotten older I find that I dont like getting hot and sweaty or rubbing against other hot and sweaty dudes.  more than that I dont like hurting people or getting hurt and both were happening frequently.
p3221
aVDo you go to any post-rock shows? I think the atmosphere that both these genres create live is unbelievable. The air grows thick. You feel the music all over your body. You can just melt into the spot you're standing.
p3222
aVClosest I've gone to is Alcest a few weeks back and it WAS pretty incredible.  As much as I love Isis and Pelican (both of whom I've seen live), I didn't enjoy them as much.  
p3223
aVI don't see how Alcest is close at all. o_0 Shoegaze and black metal.
p3224
aVThere really aren't a lot of black metal elements - particularly in their latest release.\u000a\u000aMaybe the lines for me are less distinctly drawn than you, but I don't find any one genre of the post-variety to be very clearly defined.  Isis and Neurosis are both considered post metal, but the two bands are pretty far apart.  Shoegaze and post-rock seem like very similar genres, to me.
p3225
aVNeurosis should not be considered post-metal. People really need to stop that.\u000a\u000aShoegaze and post-rock are cousins at best. My Bloody Valentine really sounds nothing like Godspeed.
p3226
aVMore sludge than postmetal, anyway : Jesu - Silver.
p3227
aVLike most people here, Isis got me into post metal.\u000a\u000aIt was like 2007, or 2008. I was at work. Pandora was huge at the time, and I had an Opeth radio station going. All of a sudden, [Garden of Light](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEu-8hjxpog) comes on. Instantly intrigued. Listened to the whole song. Got the discography about an hour later. Haven't looked back.
p3228
aVRussian Circles.
p3229
aVMy friend and I went to Fun Fun Fun Fest in 2009 and my friend was really excited about seeing Russian Circles so she sent me a link of "Death Rides A Horse". Absolutely loved it (I ride horses too so the name helped) and when they played it live, I fell in love. Saw This Will Destroy You also at that festival, got Neurosis' entire discovegraphy (sp?) from my brother, and a couple Isis records too. 
p3230
aVIn the 10th grade a good friend turned me onto "Enemy of the Sun." I had never heard anything like "Lost" before that point and listening to it for the first time was one of the moments where my taste kind of woke up and started to broaden. I'll never forget that first listen. Powerful stuff.
p3231
aVI saw this rehearsal video of [Isis - Garden of Light](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2HRzP7gCeo). Never looked back.
p3232
aVI just went nine minutes without blinking.
p3233
aVsame as OP.  nightendday is one of the most powerful songs ever written in my opinion.
p3234
aVI forget how I found out about it but Pelican's The Fire in our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw is what really turned me onto post metal.  I came from post rock and it was probably some link to Godspeed that brought me to it.  I really love the F#A# album.  From Pelican I got into Isis and then Neurosis and everything grew from there.
p3235
aVThat album is absolutely incredible.  I really wish Pelican would go back to writing those longer, epic songs.
p3236
aVYeah they certainly became a bit more riffy.  I did like City of Echoes but didn't get into the follow up album all that much.  From Pelican I found Isis, Mouth of the Architect, Cult of Luna and Neurosis.  It took me down the rabbit hole.
p3237
aVVery similar to what happened to me. I started off with post-rock before moving into post-metal.
p3238
aVSomeone made fun of me for listening to Mastodon of all bands, and told me to listen to Neurosis.
p3239
aVOkay, then how did you get into post-metal after listening to sludge metal like Neurosis? Just the search for the more experimental side of the genre?
p3240
aVnote Neurosis in the "Legends" column in the side bar.  As a musicology student I'm inclined to indicate that i think Neurosis can count as post metal for most working defintions of post metal.\u000a\u000aBut yes, exactly.  That band opened me up to a fundamentally different way to be "heavy".
p3241
aV&gt;Neurosis can count as post metal for most working defintions of post metal.\u000a\u000aWhat are the more common definitions of post metal? I tell people post metal is my favorite music genre, but I'm never sure how exactly to describe it. 
p3242
aVeh, without getting into school of thouht or being lame and academic, I can say that "post" often refers to a sort of deconstruction of something.  You can keep certain fundamental asthetic assumtions, but come at it in a radically different way.  The PostMetal we're talking about is realy only one of the way you can be a post-metal band, but it's the only prevalent stream.
p3243
aVThat same sidebar with explosions in the sky and earth?\u000a\u000aNeurosis is as post-metal as Tool.
p3244
aVI share your concern with Explosions and Earth.  I think you're silly about Neurosis and comparing them to Tool is not so much an argument as it is some sort of slander haha.  I'm not sure I have my essay ready on this one, we're going to have to agree to disagree, then I'll sneak over to r/sludge and snicker about how you thought Neurosis was sludge, instead of  "a kinda sludgy post metal band".
p3245
aVSlander? I'm just saying that both have been associated incorrectly with post-metal after the fact rather than during. Also, Neurosis is totally experimental sludge. They predate post-metal. Also, people post Isis on that subreddit if that tells you anything. There's also a Neurosis link in the first 30.
p3246
aVI was on a message board where Isis and Pelican were being discussed in 2004 or 2005. I think I actually checked out both bands in 2005 as I distinctly remember listening to both in high school. Isis' Panopticon album really stands out when I think of that time.
p3247
aVPelican's *The Fire In Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw* was my first post metal album. I was listening to a lot of doom metal at the time, and a friend send me that album. From there I got into Isis hard. I love how with post metal and post rock, you can just keep digging for more great bands and you never come up short. Every now and then I just remark: "This was here the whole time?!?"\u000a\u000aEdit: Also, around the time I was getting into post metal, I would always listen to Last.fm while cooking supper. Found out about a lot of great bands in a hurry by firing up "Isis radio" and just listening to what came down the pipe. 
p3248
aV&gt; I love how with post metal and post rock, you can just keep digging for more great bands and you never come up short. Every now and then I just remark: "This was here the whole time?!?"\u000a\u000aI hear ya!  I've mentioned on here how sometimes I like to go to youtube, type in a band/song I like, and just browse the related videos to discover bands I'd never heard of before.  I'm always amazed at the sheer amount of good music I find - to the point I actually have to be pretty picky about it.
p3249
aVSaw Isis live on my 21st birthday. Never turned back since.\u000a\u000a(P.S. Left the drunk-off-my-ass part to the next day. Was a good weekend)
p3250
aV&gt; (P.S. Left the drunk-off-my-ass part to the next day. Was a good weekend)\u000aHa, good idea.  Seeing Isis drunk would be a complete waste (both of booze and a great musical performance)
p3251
aVin my case it was a band called **the ocean**. just a bunch of great and kickass musicians!!!
p3252
aVNeurosis - Through Silver and Blood back in 1999 or something?  I was just a hardcore/metal kid back then.  That album changed my life.
p3253
aVA friend of mine posted a link to Isis' "In Fiction" video a few  years ago.  By the time that closing bass line came around I was like YOINK.
p3254
aVISIS and Aereogramme - Low Tide. The first time I listened to this song I almost had an out of body experience, I kept listening to it on repeat for days. Downloaded Oceanic and Panopticon of ISIS without knowing that it was not ISIS who provided the vocals for Low Tide. At that time I was a shoegaze, prog rock and post rock man, not a fan of metal and harsh vocals. The first few times I listened to Oceanic and Panopticon I didn't like the vocals despite being mind-blown by the music.  One day I was in a 2 hours long drive in a deserted highway, I put on Panopticon on my phone (which is my main music player) and plug in the headphones and listen to the whole thing. There was one big difference between my previous listens and that very one, everything was different, it all clicked in my head, the lyrics, the music, the emotions it all infused together and made sense to me, and since that day I got hooked to post metal and it became one of my favourite genres. 
p3255
aVA couple of my friends in high school were really big into Tool, and saw them the following summer ('07... west coast dates had ISIS supporting them, but the east coast dates, where I was, had Big Business).  Started really doing some research into Tool, finding similar bands and what not, and eventually came across "sludge."  Namely Melvins and Electric Wizard.  From there, finally stumbled across ISIS, and Pelican, and shortly there after Neurosis, et al.
p3256
aVIt was Tool. I had a time, when I listened to Tool alot.\u000a\u000aAlthough I have not been there myself, I learned about a band that went on Tour with Tool - it was Isis.\u000a\u000aOceanic finally got me. Still one of my favorite Albums.\u000a

You can tell that from the songs that have all been released anyways.\u000a\u000aLes Discrets doesn't make post-metal. He makes something closer to post-rock and shoegaze.

aVAccording to metalsucks.net this is the second track of the EP. I can see why it wasn't included on Vertikal I since it doesn't really fit in anywhere even though the overall sound fits the theme of the album. As for the structure of the song, I think it maybe would be better off cut down to 2-3 minutes and instead act as an interlude track like "the sweep" or "disharmonia". But I'm most certain it will be important for the dynamic on Vertikal II as it is. Other than that it's a really good song despite its softer approach.

aVThey sound a whole lot more like post-metal than emo or screamo, but I understand where you're coming from.
p3400
aVWhat? They have absolutely no sludge metal elements. It's not anywhere close to post-metal.  Lyrical content and delivery is very much skramz. A lot of the instrumentals sit right alongside stuff like Envy.
p3401
aVI understand what you mean, but honestly I don't know about the music. The riffs aren't very "skramz" to be honest, the lyrics, absolutely. The riffing reminds me a lot of other kinds of post metal, but I digress. If this honestly is the wrong subreddit, I'm really sorry!

Never heard of it; why not!\u000a\u000aI had never heard this band 'til now.  I heard a bit of Cult of Luna in this band before I knew they were Swedish, so I drew the comparison objectively.  I would say that CoL is just as much influenced by hardcore as by sludge. Is this a problem?  Must post-metal be derived from sludge? This is clearly influenced by screamo and shoegaze.  What if I posted Alcest?  That's like shoegaze with BM.  What about Amenra?  They're well sludgy, but the vocals are a bit sreamo-ey.  Where is the post-metal line drawn?\u000a\u000aEdited for formatting and consistent capitalisation.
p3409
aV&gt; Must post-metal be derived from sludge?\u000a\u000aThat's literally the origins of the genre. \u000a\u000a&gt;This is clearly influenced by screamo and shoegaze.\u000a\u000aWell, post-rock and screamo, but either way neither are post-metal. There's just minimal metal elements to SFFSs sound.\u000a\u000a&gt;What if I posted Alcest? That's like shoegaze with BM. \u000a\u000aYeah, it's post-black if it's something before the new album. Under the very loose rules it fits.\u000a\u000a&gt;What about Amenra?\u000a\u000aClose enough to fit.\u000a\u000a&gt;Where is the post-metal line drawn?\u000a\u000aWhere it's actually sludge metal or something derived from it.

VI'd say this is closer to the doom side of metal than anything considering it's slow and droning. Not much sludge in there. Crosses genres without giving a fuck though so I can see people here digging it.\u000a\u000aI definitely like this after I got over the vocals. I just wish the drummer was more interesting, though. He does fine when it's not slow but during the slow parts he doesn't do much.\u000a\u000aIf it's not clicking... turn it the fuck up.

V100% love this band and all of their roots.\u000a\u000aBack in 2004/2005 when I was listening to a lot of metalcore, I went to a tiny club to see a pretty big band at the time, Bleeding Through.  They packed that little club elbow-to-elbow.  The opening act for them was a 6-piece deathcore group from Minneapolis with two singers called [Nehemiah](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Nehemiah/12069).  They broke up not long after that, but a few years later, I found most of the members had reformed under a new name, Everest.  They only released one EP before changing their name to Iron Thrones, because apparently there's some indie band named Everest.  You can (and should) listen to Everest's EP here: http://everestmn.bandcamp.com/

VI like this song somewhat but the rest is kinda meh.  I'm probably going to be the only person here to say this, but I don't really like Pelican anymore.  Their first two full lengths were great (especially The Fire in Our Throats...one of my favorite albums ever), but everything they've done since has felt lazy and boring.  I've been hoping they'd go back to that style but it looks like they've abandoned it for good.
p3439
aVthey have gotten soft imo. nothing compared to the older stuff
p3440
aVI did! While City of Echoes and What We've Come To Need didn't really do much for me, I liked the EP. If nothing else they'll still be worth seeing live.
p3441
aVThey definitely are still one if the most earth crushing bands live, definitely worth seeing.
p3442
aVWhen I saw them with Isis a couple years back, they seemed to play only material from City of Echoes/What We All Come to Need.  I was extremely disappointed.  Have they gone back to playing older material lately?
p3443
aVNo idea. I saw them shortly after city of echoes was released and they played mostly older stuff, great show. If they're not performing some of their original stuff now then I'm pretty disappointed
p3444
aVNot really, when I saw them it was mostly WWACTN and a couple off The Fire and City of Echoes, But I'm really a huge fan of WWACTN, and just purely based on the huge sound they have I think it's not really possible to not enjoy it, they are legitimately heaviest band I have ever seen.\u000a\u000aI would have loved to see then support Isis, I'm really fucking bummed that they split up before I really got into them.

aVSomeone in the post-rock sub-reddit did.\u000a\u000aThe EPs alright.

aVJakob.  
p3482
aVWhenever I listen to Isis I always hear a pretty clear Neurosis influence.  I'd recommend some slightly older albums by them, namely 'Enemy of the Sun', 'Through Silver and Blood', and 'Times of Grace'. 
p3483
aVI've always struggled with Neurosis and I just find them plain brutal and abrasive without much else to say about them. Am I wrong?
p3484
aVYes!  Each Neurosis album is quite different, especially their mid to late era stuff.  If you want to start with something less abrasive The Eye of Every Storm would work.
p3485
aVAgreed. This is a great album and far more forgiving than much of their other work. I'd say its easier to listen to than some of the earlier Isis albums. 
p3486
aVYou're not wrong; it took me a long time to warm up to Neurosis. They experiment a ton and never settle into a single, solid post-metal sound like most of the bands they influenced. Their newer stuff, though, especially "Given to the Rising", is as pure post-metal as you'll find in their catalogue.
p3487
aVYou're extremely wrong but this guy also isn't right in recommending them when you're used to Isis.

aVTBH Galilean Satellites is the only Rosetta album I really like.  The others are okay but they don't have the magic of their first album.  I know a lot of people are big fans of Wake/Lift, but the awful vocal mix ruins that album for me.  Might be worth giving it a shot though.
p3496
aVIf you like Rosetta,  check out VYGR. I can't link because I'm on mobile. Everything they've done is great. Spacy, doomy, sludgy from Boston, I believe. \u000a\u000aThey only have a couple songs on YouTube but I hope you like what you hear enough to buy their stuff.
p3497
aVNope, Galilean Satellites is their best. Be sure to hear the "mixed" version; the album was released as a heavy disc and an ambient disc meant to be played together. 
p3498
aV&gt;Nope, Galilean Satellites is their best.\u000a\u000aNot sure I agree with that. It has a lot of really great moment but I feel like the nostalgia I have for the album is stronger than the actual album when I re-listen to it.

p3513
(lp3514
VI thought it was a step up from "Providence", but still a far cry from "Noir" (my second-favorite post-metal album ever) and "True Nature Unfolds". I just don't think the sound they're going for now with the new vocalist is all that appealing, though I applaud them for at least trying something unique. I was reminded of Woven Hand (or David Eugene Edwards in general) a lot on "Secret Youth", which was pleasant. I could totally imagine this material translating poorly to a live setting. It's become very introspective, low-energy music.
p3515
aVI somehow love the way the vocalist Jani does the harsh vocals but his clean singing mannerisms are not that enjoyable at times. I dig some of the cleans too as they remind me a bit of another band from Svart Records called Beastmilk but that's pretty much it. Noir is and will be one of post-metal's epitome albums.

"Conference of the Birds" and "In Dead Palm Fields" are two of my favorite songs ever.  *Shels can go seamlessly between several styles in the same track, somehow amalgamating brass, strings, guitars and piano into something greater than the whole of its parts.  Great stuff.

aVI'm so glad these guys are getting attention here. I'm from Atlanta and these guys are awesome. I was really excited too when they returned to their original sound with ashes. I got worried awhile back when I went to a show before Light came out and they were giving away their merch and hearing rumors of disbanding. Thankfully, their still ripping it.

p3733
(lp3734
VPretty cool stuff, thanks for sharing.\u000a\u000aThe first bit (0:45) sounds a bit busy with 3+ guitars all going at once; having only two guitars (e.g. 3:45) is much easier to follow. I really like the use of trumpet (wind instruments are really underused in metal).\u000a\u000aNo complaints about demo #2.
p3735
aVThanks for the feedback! I think the overly-busy issue will be fixed in post with more proper mixing; it's hard to get perfect separation via Guitar Pro. I was trying to have a bunch of melodic lines in counterpoint to create that controlled chaos, and later add some spoken word / yelled vocals over the majority of that phrase. And yeah, thankfully I have 10+ years of classical training on trumpet so I'll be able to do it live. Gonna add some mallet percussion and stuff later in the record too.\u000a\u000aSince you liked the second demo, did the final syncopation have the crazy huge impact I intended it to?

p3772
aVNot sure if you guys are looking for feedback, but I thought it was quite good -- you are all obviously talented musicians and know what you are doing. I like the very sudden punky-shoegaze turn 4 minutes in. In the same vein of some of the other posters, the belting vocals feel a bit out of place or too forced. A grittier overall vocal sound rather than oscillating between belting and growling would sound nicer to me personally.\u000a\u000aGood luck! c:

(lp3782
VDefinitely the most mature work from Cult of Luna in my opinion, a concept perfectly developed along the whole record. It just give me chills when I hear those 6 notes from the first track repeated with that futuristic tone during the entire Vertikal to the whispering way on Passing Through and Vertikal II. They should have included the EP content in the original record tho, it woulda been perfect.
p3783

aVI saw them in NYC. Blew me away, but I have a soft spot for Salvation and Highway. 
p3785
aVThey tried to stream it in full on Spotify, but I guess it ended up getting taken down.
p3786
aVI still listen to Vertikal about 3 times a week. A lot of listeners don't pick up on the repeated theme but I think it goes further. In my view opening track 'O R O' from Vertikal II echoes the same pulsating start as 'The One' from Vertikal and the same theme that returns three more times in the full length album (listen to them side by side). Yes there are clean vocals and the instrumentation is heavy but not as heavy as 'The One'. Then, before you know it, 'O R O' transforms into an adaptation of the closing minutes of  'Passing Through', also from Vertikal and the fourth time we hear the theme on the album, albeit in truncated form. The last part of the song is essentially 'The Sweep'; the second encounter with the theme on the album. Both recordings came from five years of gestation, so rather than an out-take from the Vertikal sessions the song is like a thumbnail sketch, or more accurately the genesis of Vertikal. Or perhaps they simply crawled out of the primordial soup together.

aVThat wouldn't be Mains de Givres for which you played the drums, would it? Tremendously good album as well! \u000aWe're going to release that one next year. Probably around summer. Don't worry, I'll give a shout if we're there.\u000a\u000aEric will be staying at our place for a couple of days while he'll be playing in town. He'll also do a radio session when he's here, which I'll gladly post here when it's recorded and stored on soundcloud. \u000a\u000aI'll surely say hi from "drummer Scottyscotty". :)\u000a\u000aThe record is indeed sold out at the label. I'm sure there are still some retail copies circulating, but Destructure is all out at the moment.\u000a
p3811
aVi unforunately did not drum on mains de givres...amazing album though.  i wish i had.  \u000a\u000awhat eric and i did was something a little different. it was honestly TQA with driving drums. had a very year of no light build and feel.  (i drum in alaskan, so, my style in that band came through with TQA). i'm not even sure if it has a name or anything. eric and i want to release it at some point, but, it's not a rush. \u000a\u000atell eric he has "good riffs". he hates the word "riff" so of course i kept saying it :)
p3812
aVAh, great. I'll ask Eric about it when I see him.\u000aYou made me really curious about the result.\u000a\u000aAnd very well, I'll compliment him on his riffs with your regards. :)\u000a

VThe Ocean Collective peaked early with this album. I love their energy in live shows, but none of their new material compares well to Precambrian.
p3918
aVI disagree. I thought Heliocentric was the best thing they've done. Anthropocentric was also really good. The latest is a lot less memorable.\u000a\u000aThis album in particular just doesn't seem like they're fleshing out the ideas as well as they do on later albums.
p3919
aVFirmament is the only song that I can stand from Heliocentric. I think Anthropocentric is great. Aeolian is a close third. Disc 2 of Precambrian can't be beat.
p3920
aVWhy can't you stand most of Heliocentric? I think it's their most tightly executed, coherent, and best-paced album.
p3921
aVHeliocentric had just come out when I started listening to them. The city in the sea from Aeolian was my my introduction to the band. Precambrian was next. Heliocentric just didn't pack the same kind of punch.
p3922
aV&gt;Heliocentric just didn't pack the same kind of punch.\u000a\u000aThat's correct. It packs a completely different kind of punch. One that's a lot more effective than anything else they've done. The rest of their work just isn't as well put-together. Anthropocentric just sounds like a bunch of extra songs rather than an album.
p3923
aVQuite the opposite here. I accidentally bought Heliocentric (just cause it looked neat and was tagged post-metal) and was stunned both by the album design and sound. When later I checked their other works, for some reason they did not left as much impact on me.

This list would be far better if he limited himself more. And christ, only 5 albums a page?
p4002
aVI thought Quietly was on there. \u000a\u000aIf we're throwing Lightbearer on there I'd toss on Mammal by Altar of Plauges as well and if they're gonna let Alcest pass then Sunbather is also a pretty good torch-passing album between a few genres that deserves recognition even if people *hate* the way it's been labeled.

aV&gt; SWEET! Nothing's like Salvation but still\u000a\u000aI don't get this attitude. Bands are allowed to have more than one great album even if it's not going to be their best. If someone else put out the same album you wouldn't make the comparison. Personally I thought Vertikal was the best thing they've done since Salvation.
p4070
aVReally? How did you feel about Somewhere Along the Highway? That might honestly be my favorite.
p4071
aVIt isn't an "attitude", it's my personal opinion. If they had made an album that I liked more I would have said/will say "Nothing tops _______" but for me, it's Salvation. My opinion on which record is a personal favorite doesn't negate the quality of their other releases either.\u000a\u000aedit: based on your reddit history, I wonder if you get off on trying to point out erroneous commentary?

p4075
aVBecause it's perfectly reasonable for me to give context to my opinion, to allow strangers to have insight into the other Cult releases that I enjoy. Also, I can say whatever the fuck I want. Because reddit.\u000a\u000aNot sure why I'm trying to reason with you. I suspect you'd be upset if they released another album about a mad man's diary and I said "It's just another Eternal Kingdom" ;)

aVThis one grew on me.  Good EP.

aVWHY IS THIS ALBUM SO GOOD
p4144
aVWord.  New album is fucking brilliant.  Better than Wake/Lift and Determinism and equally as good if not better than The Galilean Satellites imo
p4145
aVYou think TGS is their best? Hmm... I'm not so sure about that. It seemed like they were still finding their sound at the time and it's really inconsistent. I'm torn between ADOM and Wake/Lift as their best (not counting this yet) as ADOM is more consistent (and less repetitive) but Wake/Lift has more "high" moments. 
p4146
aVCompletely agreed. Wake is a fucking masterpiece and (in my opinion) *the* quintessential Rosetta song. But then right after it, you have Temet Nosce... ADOM, on the other hand, has absolutely zero dull moments, unless you count Blue Day for Croatoa.
p4147
aVI like Blue Day for Croatoa as an instrumental, pace setting track for the album. Especially now that I know what the song title means.
p4148
aVYou do? Is it about the Roanoke Colony? Because otherwise it flew way over my head.
p4149
aVIt's from the comic *100 Bullets.* I just looked it up and yes, what the comic is referencing is about Roanoke Colony. I guess I don't know my history because I wasn't sure if the comic was referencing something real or not until now.\u000a\u000aEither way, Blue Day for Croatoa is a song that's somewhat important to the plot of the comic, and I'm more than certain enough that Armine would be enough of a geek to make that reference.
p4150
aVOh, cool, thanks. I've always wondered what that was about.
p4151
aVTGS is definitely my favorite by them and it ain't even close.  I don't really see the inconsistency (although that first heavy part in Itinerant does strike me as slightly out of place), and the last track is easily my favorite by them.\u000a\u000aI should probably give this new album some more listens, but I've come away pretty unimpressed.  Nothing reached out and grabbed me like in previous albums.
p4152
aVAt this point it is a toss up between the new album and TGS for best album.  One of the common factors being the vocals are a bit more out in front in the mix.  Wake/Lift and ADOM are great albums but I always felt the vocals are too buried.  The new album is exceptional in my opinion.  Bass and drumming in particular.  The only complaint I have is with Hodoku / Compassion.  The clean vocals don't work and the song feels out of place.
p4153
aVYeah agreed. The clean vocals worked on ADOM but they need to be used right. Light Bearer did clean vocals 2 albums in a row and it was much more powerful when they were used the first time around as they limited it to just that use. Either way I overall enjoy this trend. I think the latest MOTA is my favorite album by them and it's largely because of the clean vocals.
p4154
aVYeah the new MOTA album is fantastic.  Man this has been a great year for music.  New Intronaut, Ocean, MOTA, Rosetta, etc.  
p4155
aVI haven't listened to the new Intronaut since I'm still bummed I missed them when I got really drunk to try and get over how bad Scale the Summit was when I saw MOTA, StS, and Introanut. I guess it's time to get over it.
p4156
aVThat sucks dude.  I completely agree with you about STS.  Talented band but kinda boring live.  MOTA was outstanding and Intronaut were as good as any band I have ever seen live.  I have seen many good bands in my life and Intronaut is right up there.  I have seen them twice now.  Really bummed I am going to miss them with Cult of Luna.  Can't believe I forgot to mention Vertikal on that list.  Like I said great year for good music.
p4157
aVSTS is all skill and no talent IMO. They can barely write a song but they can certainly play.
p4158
aVI like their new album but their live performance just didn't do much for me.  Technical instrumental metal walks a delicate line between creativity and jerkin it for the sake of jerkin it.  Animals as Leaders is a band that get's it right imo.  They are fantastic live.
p4159
aVThe album music is as good as the album cover is bad. Really.
p4160
aVThe album cover is much worse, I would say.
p4161
aVSo the album cover is worse than the music is good? I can agree. Good but not breathtaking music, AWFUL art.
p4162
aVExactly. I mean, Rosetta's music is always great, but this is definitely not their best.\u000a\u000aAnd christ that cover is awful.

p4178
(lp4179
VYou know, I always thought it was kind of odd that people would classify it in the post-metal genre. I get the whole doom thing, but really I hear it as being straight up drone when you really take into consideration the entirety of SunnO)))'s work. You are technically right that it is music that has come after metal that isn't still specifically metal but if we are talking like that, you could say that really anything is post-metal or post-rock or post-yada yada yada forever. I can see how perhaps in the spirit of the music it might fit into post0metal but stylistically I see it really only fitting the blue print for drone and doom. Haha I guess I could probably go on and on but that's my opinion. I like SunO))) lolz
p4180
aVThis really nails it.
p4181
aV[deleted]
p4182
aVPost-metal is sludgey atmospheric stuff. Think Neurosis after their hardcore transition. Sunn O))) is typically classified as a drone metal band. Which comes from doom, not sludge. As cuntbitchdick points out as well.
p4183
aVi think of ulver very clearly as post-metal because of their first 3 albums. but i dunno. i think sunn always sounded that same dronecore thing its been. so i guess the question is: is drone metal post metal. my personal opinion is to not label anything, the lines of influence are too broad with good bands these days. but when pushed i guess that i think drone metal is just drone metal. it's its own thing

aVMike Armine (Rosetta's vocalist) mentioned it on this [podcast](http://www.mbnpodcast.com/) that he appears on occasionally... I can't remember which episode it was on though... It might have been episode 15. Their drummer, BJ Murtrie is on it every week but he doesn't really talk about Rosetta all that much. It's a pretty entertaining podcast most of the time, I recommend listening to it.\u000a\u000aEDIT: They also mentioned the EP a few times on their blog, [http://rosettaband.com/](http://rosettaband.com/), but Armine specifically mentioned the NIN style track in the podcast.
p4198

Was awesome, pity I couldn't stay round for any longer.\u000a\u000aBut what was awesome, Brisbane was the last gig of their down under tour, and they left for a plane flight about 20 minutes after they finished, so all the supporting bands ended up jumping in for the last song and it was just so mental.

aVSpotify makes sense but on YT it's not gapless, there's no link to purchase, you have to stream a video just to play music, no background audio on mobile apps unless you pay, it's more than likely transcoded, and going further into that you can't verify the source.\u000a\u000aYou should really only be posting BC as the main post and then a Spotify link for people who use that service.

aVBandcamp is *far* more preferable on mobile than Youtube. Why would anyone on a phone want to stream a video when they can just load some HTML5 music?
p4385
aVI don't know if you've noticed, but no one else on this sub really cares about strict genre definitions.
p4386
aVI find that people mostly post post-metal. This isn't a matter of being strict. This is blatantly not post-metal and there's another sub where it's more appropriate.
p4387
aV&gt;  This is blatantly not post-metal and there's another sub where it's more appropriate.\u000a\u000aI disagree with this. The alternating light and heavy sections, the complexity of the structure, the lengthy running time, and the de-emphasis on vocals are post-metal hallmarks. Is it 100% post metal? No, there are multiple influences in there. But it's 2013 and bands can't just remake Oceanic or At The Soundless Dawn every two years. \u000a\u000aI'm pretty sure if I posted it to /r/stonermetal someone there would have told me it isn't slow enough or tune low enough. If it really doesn't belong here, the mods can remove it. 
p4388
aV&gt; The alternating light and heavy sections, the complexity of the structure, the lengthy running time, and the de-emphasis on vocals are post-metal hallmarks.\u000a\u000aNone of those are things that define the genre. That's like saying something is post-rock if there's a crescendo that leads into an explosive climax.\u000a\u000aI do think it's possible that post-metal was an influence on this bands sound as it was pretty varied across the album but I heard more post-rock in there than sludge metal.
p4389
aVAs a member of this band it makes me really happy that people are fighting over what genre we are rather than calling us a Neurosis/Isis ripoff. What can we do to be more post-metal for you? (check all that apply)\u000a_ More delay\u000a_ More scramz\u000a_ More beards (I'm looking at you, Steve)\u000a_ More literature references\u000a_ More vinyl\u000a_ Fewer riffs\u000a_ Fewer pinch harmonics \u000a_ Fewer songs under 10 minutes\u000a_ Fewer songs\u000a_ Fewer live shows\u000a
p4390
aVDon't worry about our petty arguments. What you're doing right now is just fine.. \u000a\u000aActually, now that I think about it, the monologue in Blackdamp was a little off-putting, but everything else was great.\u000a
p4391
aVNone of those things make it more post-metal and you don't sound like a Neurosis/Isis ripoff at all. I just think that it was a mistake of OP to call this post-metal in the first place. You shouldn't try to be more post-metal. Do what you want. Let us try and classify it.
p4392
aVI knew what you meant dude just havin' fun.
p4393
aVNo, I'm with Given. That's a fairly accurate description for such a nebulous genre.
p4394
aVConsidering the big post-rock influence I'd say that the structures are basic. Complex structures would be found in stuff like prog and not sludge metal and post-metal. Alternating light and heavy is also not essential to the genre and neither is long songs. I would say that most post-metal bands emphasize the vocals as much as any other atmospheric genre.\u000a\u000aI don't see how describing what a few bands do is an accurate description of the genre. Like I said, it's like saying something is post-rock because it follows the explosions in the sky style. It's very dangerous and limiting to have such a narrow scope.\u000a\u000aPost-metal is essentially atmospheric sludge metal.  It's sludge metal with post-rock influences. Before the term was widely accepted (a very recent thing) these bands would always be lumped in with sludge.

p4401

p4402
aVI bought Yellow &amp; Green when it came out. I listened to it once and was incredibly disappointed with it, so I shelved it and didn't really bother with it again. Then, I saw Baroness live and it was one of the best metal shows I have ever seen. Absolutely incredible. I gave the album another listen, and I can appreciate it so much more now. I actually prefer the Green disc, but Yellow is amazing as well. It's no Blue Record or Red Album, but it's definitely a solid 4.5/5.
p4403
aVFor those who dislike their last album, the songs form Yellow/Green are much more heavy live. Worth a listen anyway.\u000a\u000aEdit: more available on [bandcamp](http://baroness.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-maida-vale-bbc)

aVYellow is amazing and some of the best work they've ever done. Green is pretty shit though.

VI love post metal intensely, but never got Pelican. I feel like (and I know how this is gonna sound) their songwriting and musicianship took a huge dive after Australasia.  But I'd love to hear notions to the contrary or tracks that would change my mind. Either way, psyched for op.
p4426
aVPersonally I'm a huge fan. Their songwriting technique has always been some of my favorite since I found them, but that's just me personally.\u000a\u000aTalked with them a bit at the merch table and it sounds like their most popular album is "The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw". I myself am a big fan of the album "City of Echoes" as well as "What We All Come to Need". Off of the latter I particularly like, ["Final Breath"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0IVG8a3TN4&amp;list=PLmWRjKN7X_vno6kfYKDQW8bZItuqU0hC9&amp;index=6) which is a bit of a departure from their normal style being that it's a bit more laid back and includes some vocals.\u000a\u000aEither way, like them or not, they are great musicians and absolutely floored their live set tonight. Super tight and very high energy which drew the crowd in.
p4427
aVI agree but will say they went downhill after A Fire in Our Throats.  It seemed like the logical next step after Australasia with their songs being a bit less drone-y and more focused.  Then they said "People don't seem to enjoy listening to these songs live" and shifted to whatever it is you'd call what they're doing now (boring is my preferred word).\u000a\u000aI really miss the old Pelican.  I get that they want to write songs that people can get into during a concert, but I don't see why that has to prevent them from writing a couple of those slower, more post-metaly songs like Nightendday per album.
p4428
aVDefinitely agree though I thought Forever Becoming was a lot better than other recent efforts. Ataraxia/Taraxis is when they started turning it back around.
p4429
aVJust walked in and ready to see this this amazing band play. Pelican has been one of my absolute favorites for a couple years and were the first band to get me into the genre. \u000a\u000aI'll make sure to take plenty of pictures and get back on how fantastic they are.\u000a\u000aEdit: WOW. Blown away by the set tonight. They are fantastic live. I have no idea when my ears will stop ringing but the tinnitus is well worth it. Played a good mix of old and new stuff and gave an encore as well. Absolutely cannot wait to see these guys again some day.\u000a\u000a[Here's an album of some of the pictures I took.](http://imgur.com/a/rgBjL). Had to use my phone because I didn't have access to a nicer camera tonight. Did a bit of editing to soften up the shitty quality so sorry for the instagramish look. Picked up some merch for $40 bucks after the show. Really happy to help these guys out and get to see them live. It was incredible.
p4430
aVWear earplugs to shows dude.
p4431
aVHah! Yea I had meant to. I was scrambling to find them before the show and couldn't.
p4432
aV&gt;  I have no idea when my ears will stop ringing but the tinnitus is well worth it.\u000a\u000aI know this was a joke but I want to reinforce that tinnitus is definitely NOT worth it.  The feeling you get when it's been there for about a week and hasn't even started to go away and you realize it's there for life and a moment's silence will never be the same again is absolutely awful.

p4455
aVI don't know if I am able to translate my feel of the song into words to describe what kind of drums &gt;I&lt; would find more fitting for the song... but I'll try:  \u000aThe song itself builds quite nicely but the main part of the drums is stale. It's for the lack of a better word - very obvious. It mimicks the instrumental part instead of adding to it. It's the same as if a singer would sing the same melody as the main instrument in the song.  \u000aConstant open hihat takes away from the power of the song instead of adding to it, when it's always open. \u000a\u000aTwo more things, the keys seem to be a little too loud throughout the song (minor mix adjustments would fix it), and the final keys in the double bass section seem to be off to the beat (maybe it's your artistic choice).  \u000a\u000aIf you would care to share the instrumental part - I could try to lay my interpretation of drums.\u000a\u000a\u000a

(lp4509
VI kept waiting for the post-metal to happen and it never did. I gave up mostly through the 3rd song. The guitar player is far too obnoxious. Bass player is alright but it's one of those bands where I feel like I notice the bass more because the drumming is just sort of there and the lead guitar is committing auto-fellacio.
p4510
aVThere's a lot about this that I like, but you're probably not here for praise so much as you're looking for some CC. That said, great work!\u000a\u000aAs for the criticism, I'm really not a fan of the tones on this record, PARTICULARLY the bass tone (I'm a bassist in a post-metal band myself, so naturally that's what I've scrutinized the most). All the guitars/bass could use some more reverb, and a little of the bass's midrange and low end could use some reduction. Even with headphones with good bass response, the bass is clipping and is a little overwhelming, but not in the right way. This may be a mixing issue rather than a tone/recording one, but I can't tell having listened only to the final product.\u000a\u000aThe drums kick ass! ;)

Weird seeing this posted so recently, as this is my first time ever going on this subreddit, and I almost never go on reddit in general. Thanks for posting the music video! And yes, I agree, it's ridiculous as hell, haha. But we were only 18 when we made it, so go easy!\u000a\u000aAlso yes, I was asked to play drums for them a few years ago, but they ended up finding someone else who was more geographically convenient. Fun fact: he was the drummer for Big D and The Kids Table. What the hell, right?\u000a\u000aAlso also, as to new music: I've talked with the guys a few times recently, and Irepress seems to be a dying project. Their drummer, Sheel, plays full-time with the band Bad Rabbits, and everyone else in the band is really busy with other stuff. They're gonna be putting out a six-song release later this year, but I get the idea that's gonna be the credit roll for them.
p4556

p4557
aVThe video is pretty funny. These guys need to put out some new music. Fun fact (if I'm remembering this correctly): The guy who filmed/directed has played drums with them when one of the dudes had his back hurt or some shit... so there's a brief shot of him playing the drums (I think it's a youtube video.)

aVyeah the production is as lowbudget as it gets. the drums had to be e-drums because a mic set for my drumkit is way to expensive and since i don't own a bass, i used my guitar and shifted it one octave down... thanks for the feedback!
p4571

Technical and still atmospheric.\u000a\u000a[Gru](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7ZAbNs47Ho) is also quite good too.\u000a\u000aYou can try /r/progmetal for more recommendations as the bands you listed also fit quite comfortably there.\u000a

aVThis is called Djent, it's not a genre per say, but a sound the guitars make.  Just search for Djent on Google, it's became ultra popular in the last 3 years.
p4729
aVYep, I can definitely see OP being into this.
p4730
aVDjent is a genre. 
p4731
aVI wasn't going to be technical, but you insist, it is a subgenre:\u000a\u000a&gt;Djent /\u02c8d\u0292\u025bnt/ is a heavy metal subgenre that developed as a spinoff of traditional progressive metal. The word "djent" is an onomatopoeia for the distinctive high-gain, distorted palm-muted guitar sound employed by Meshuggah, coined by their lead guitarist, Fredrik Thordendal. Typically, the word is used to refer to music that makes use of this sound, to the sound itself, or to the scene that revolves around it.

Try Sithu Aye, Plini, The Ralph, Intervals, TesseracT, Dead Letter Circus, The Ocean, Pomegrante Tiger, Periphery, Protest the Hero, The Safety Fire and Tool for starters. Some have vocals, some don't. TesseracT and Periphery released instrumentals of their first albums as well.

VSad to see the hate in this thread for their last EP, I honestly thought it was the best thing they've done since Wake/Lift.\u000a\u000aI'm real excited to see how their new material as a 5 piece will be
p4747
aVI don't think it was the best since Wake/Lift, but I do like it a lot. It was very reminiscent of their older stuff. I'm currently enjoying the Audio/Visual score they just released
p4748
aVWow really excited to hear it. I loved The Anaesthete, not so much their last EP. Let's see what they do.

aVIs one of them the supposed "leaked" album?  I ordered them both, so it doesn't really matter, but I'm kind of curious.
p4759
aVNo. They said they gave a "fake" album to the press because they knew it would be leaked. The songs are from the two albums, but in different orders. Plus 4 more songs

aVI love this band immensely. The whole album is amazing, but this song is sticking out today.
p4818
aVSweet. I have listened to The Ocean before I started really being into post-metal and I hadn't realized it was also post-metal. On an unrelated note, now I want to go make a CS:GO map called de_profundis.
p4819
aVWell it's partially post-metal. They're a pretty cross-genre act.
p4820
aVYep, one of the reasons why they're awesome. I came for the progressive sludge and stayed for the post-metal, so to speak.
p4821
aVthis album is an absolute masterpiece. i think it should have gotten a million billion times more recognition and praise than it did.

VThis is gorgeous! Amazing stuff; such atmosphere. Thanks for introducing such a great band.
p4842
aVProbably more atmospheric black than post-metal if you want to be pedantic, but it's cool stuff! Thanks for the link. \u000a\u000aLooks like they are on [Bandcamp](http://nhor.bandcamp.com/) for those that want to hear more, but sadly there isn't a purchase option. 
p4843
aVI really wish they had their albums for sale on bandcamp. However, it looks like their discography is available on [amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Towards-Light-Dwells-Within-Trees/dp/B00ESH1Z1O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412200786&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=nhor) for $25 so that's cool.\u000a\u000aThey are undoubtedly atmospheric black metal, but this track screams post to me. It's mostly instrumental, slow and heavy in rhythm, with piano, and a subdued tremolo guitar line that sounds more like mono than immortal.
p4844
aV&gt; this track screams post to me\u000a\u000aI don't really agree with you there, I really felt more black than anything, Don't get me wrong, i love black metal and this was a really cool hybrid. Thanks for the post
p4845
aVDude, thanks so much for posting this. I'll definitely give this band more of a listen. So chill.
p4846
aVmost of the rest of the album is black metal, but it's all quite good. the piano that weaves in and out really sells it for me.
