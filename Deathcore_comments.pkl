VAside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?
p1
(lp2
VClassical, Instrumental, Alternative, rock, soundtracks.  I've been really getting into ambient music here lately.  Stuff like Biosphere and Solar Fields.  Excellent.
p3
aVI recently discovered Solar Fields as well and it's such a nice shift away from all the chaos metal brings. Them and Tycho are the ones I've been into when it comes to those similar genres.
p4
aVTo this day.. substrata is the best album ever made , period.\u000a\u000aCarbon based lifeforms - hydroponic gardens\u000a\u000aAnd the most underrated ambient album ever- Tom Opdahl - black smoker
p5
aVI mainly listen to metal (Deathcore, Metalcore/Melodic Metalcore, Melodic Death Metal, Death Metal) so I don't listen to them often, but:\u000a\u000aPsychedelic Trance (Infected Mushroom, Astral Projection, Shpongle, Hallucinogen)\u000a\u000aBrostep (Skrillex, Excision, Downlink, Bass Nectar, Kill the Noise, Knife Party)\u000a\u000aPop (Ke$ha, Charli XCX, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu)\u000a\u000aHip Hop (Cunninlynguists, MF Doom, Run the Jewels, MC Frontalot, cLOUDDEAD)\u000a\u000aDrum n Bass (Pendulum, Photek)\u000a\u000aAnd...as much as much I'm ashamed to admit it. My Little Pony fan music\u000a\u000a
p6
aVCheck out Nerve for some sick Drum n Bass. Their drummer, Jojo Mayer, is easily one of the best drummers on the world.
p7
aVFave pone artists?\u000a

p12
aVUpvote for Less Than Jake 
p13
aVThe Science of Selling Yourself Short is the absolute shit.
p14
aVPaganini and Tartini..............fan of the violin ehh?  Good stuff right there.  
p15
aVLa Dispute Post-hardcore? Hell I don't know their genre anymore, they get posted to every core subreddit it seems. 
p16
aVaside from ph, where else have they been posted? we don allow them in /r/Metalcore 
p17
aVI'll check it out, I used alientube so it shows up when I listen to the songs. Will report back if I actually find anything...
p18
aVhonestly I only listen to metal/hardcore and variations of those two genres 
p19
aVI'm a big fan of Erykah Badu. 
p20
aVPunk, pop punk, punk rock, deathcore, pop, rap, hard rock, some electronic though not enough to know the names of the subgenres, indie, hardcore, post hardcore, and a ton of metalcore. \u000aTL:DR Anything except country and jazz
p21
aVwhat about musicals
p22
aVPhantom of the opera and wicked are awesome! Some disney stuff is rad too
p23
aVChecks out.
p24
aV[deleted]
p25
aVI can listen to some rap and warped tour bands. I don't like enough of any other genres to say I actively like them I only like 1 placebo song for example. 
p26
aVI really dig Drum&amp;Bass and Neo-Orchestral (the epic music they like to put in trailers). I also listen to Deep House, some Game-Soundtracks. Ambient is very nice, too. And a lot of "Classic" Rock, namely Rolling Stones, Slash, stuff like that. But I don't really limit myself, I don't judge music by the genre. There are songs I like and dislike in every genre. This is just the stuff that has sticked to me for the longest time, but I always experiment and try out other stuff.\u000a\u000aIf I were to recommend something, it would be Massive Attack. Their music is just absolutely fascinating and deep.
p27
aV[deleted]
p28
aVYeah ofc! Great stuff there. Also Thomas Bergersen (one of the members) has some solo stuff, also really great.
p29
aVI mostly listen to rock and metal of various subgenres, but it includes everything from pop-rock like Paramore to deathcore such as Whitechapel in my flair. My absolute favorite band right now is probably [Icon for Hire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w4JGHB2o6I) which I'd say is toward the lighter pop/punk-rock end of the spectrum. I'm really looking forward to seeing them at Warped this year. [Beautiful Bodies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZrZQWJ0CRk) is another light pop-rock band that I'm interested in checking out at Warped as well if anyone else is interested in this.
p30
aVHard rock, some pop, mostly metal though.
p31
aVhip-hop, rap, r&amp;b, classical, jazz mostly.
p32
aV/r/futurebeats
p33
aVI love me some jazz, also classical (beethoven my borhta)
p34
aVFuck yeah. I love old school hip hop (Biggie all the way), punk (Blink 182), blues (SRV, BB King), jazz (Thelonius Monk, Art Blakey), and of course classical/classical guitar type shit. 
p35
aV90% of the time I listen to metal(core)/deathcore but aside from that I also enjoy rock, punk music or electronic music such as drum &amp; bass, dubstep, frenchcore, hardtek, raggatek, crossbreed or just some reggae\u000a
p36
aVHardcore (Madball, Sick of it All)\u000a\u000aMelodic Hardcore (Being as an Ocean, Stick to Your Guns, While She Sleeps)\u000a\u000aBeatdown HC (even though there is some crossover with deathcore, Nasty, Desolated)\u000a\u000aRap (Flatbush Zombies, The Underachievers, A$AP Mob, Odd Future)\u000a\u000aIndie (Arctic Monkey's first and last albums, don't care much for the others)\u000a\u000aPop Punk (New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, Blink 182)\u000a\u000aEDIT: I absolutely love Emilie Autumn, whatever the fuck she is classed as.
p37
aVWeird hip-hop, dubstep (including "brostep"), drum'n'bass, rock, soundtracks, punk and some pop. I also enjoy some stuff like Massive Attack, but just like most people here I mostly listen to metal and hardcore.
p38
aVFunk/Soul\u000a\u000aMotown\u000a\u000aPop punk\u000a\u000aIndie\u000a\u000aShoegaze\u000a\u000aRap/Hip Hop
p39
aVHip Hop. I really like Bliss n Eso, Grieves and E-dubble. Oh, and 90s Hip Hop like Wu-Tang and Mobb Deep.
p40
aVI also enjoy ambient music (sometimes even DSBM and normal black metal) or EDM and house music
p41
aVIm mostly just into metal and shit like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mO8Ho-9iTI). Not even sure what you would call that but whatever! Haha

p43
aVPost Blackened Smooth Jazz-core
p44
aVNice one. I'm a huge fan of Hammock, Stars Of The Lid, Lowercase Noises, and anything remotely similar to post-rock and ambient music. When it comes to EDM/electronica, I like Angerfist, Coone, Burial, Tycho, Aphex Twin, Volor Flex and anything that's jumpy and/or melodic.
p45
aVPretty much weird or extreme electronic music: Igorrr, Venetian Snares, WHOURKR, Mulk, Pryapisme etc.\u000a\u000aDubstep: Dead C.A.T. Bounce, Excision, Datsik, Klaypex, Downlink, Glebstar etc.\u000a\u000aChiptune: Kubbi, Graz, any 8 bit remixes of other songs I like\u000a\u000asoundtracks: MadWorld OST, Zelda music, Mario Galaxy music, LOTR OST etc.
p46
aVI usually check out alternative and indie rock. I like stuff like Brand New and Balance and Composure, but I usually go a bit more laid back stuff like The Frontbottoms, Modern Baseball, Manchester Orchestra, Modest Mouse. I've really been getting into more folk rock type stuff lately, like The Head and The Heart, Radical Face, The Tallest Man on Earth, Paul Baribeau, Andrew Jackson Jihad.  \u000a\u000aIf I'm partying maybe some late 90s/early 00s rap.
p47
aVPunk, pop punk, screamo

asVOceano - DEAD PLANET (New Song 2015)
p49
(lp50
VWell, this is already better than their last album. 
p51
aVScott from the band Delta (not sure how many people here know them) apparently joined Oceano and took over writing responsibilities. Adam still did the lyrics, but otherwise it seems they are trying to give the band a 'facelift'. Even the hashtag they are using, #oceanoawakens, kinda implies a rebirth of sorts  
p52
aVWhat's up with Delta? I haven't heard shit about them since they released a song months ago
p53
aVI'm relatively certain they are done. :(\u000a\u000aI was reading the comments on their Facebook yesterday in a post about the oceano song and it seems that's the case. 
p54
aVYes, unfortunately the band has split up. The album Doorways was to be on probably isn't happening.
p55
aVThey broke up
p56
aVVery interesting. I did not know that. I still miss [Andrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj-qPFfwELg) though :c
p57
aVYeah, I heard about that. Personally, I'm glad. They haven't put anything out worth listening to since Depths, in my opinion. 
p58
aVholy shit, that opening hits hard.
p59
aVThis is pretty sick. I'm definitely looking forward to this album.
p60
aVi'm so glad this doesn't suck
p61
aVI can't wait to hear more, holy shit. 
p62
aVWow. That just brought back memories like the first time hearing from Depths 
p63
aVNot only was this fucking awesome but Adam turned into Christian Alvestam during that song for a bit.
p64
aVThis sounds awesome. Incisions was a very disappointing album. 
p65
aVWe don't talk about that album
p66
aVOh yeah.. what album...
p67
aVHoly shit I'm so excited.
p68
aVSo I have this nostalgia feel related to "Depths" making the other albums not really sticking out to me, but this and dawn of decent? God fucking damn, I jizz all over that shit!
p69
aVYeah totally digging it, feeling some depths style darkness and tones
p70
aVThey need to fire their producer but this is a tight song.
p71
asVHelp me get into Chelsea Grin! What should I be listening to?
p72
(lp73
VFirst two releases are the heaviest , all depends on what you prefer music wise though. 
p74
aVself titled ep 
p75
aVIt depends on how hard you like your music. They've got a bit softer as their albums have been releasing so starting at the beginning and going to the last album would be best.\u000a\u000aI'm honestly a big fan of their newer stuff though; check out Clockwork and Playing With Fire. For older I'd go with Cheyne Stokes and Crewcabanger both off their first EP.
p76
aVGod fucking damn, Cheyne Stokes is sick.
p77
aVI'd go through it chronologically, Chelsea Grin EP, Desolation of Eden, My Damnation, Evolve EP, and then Ashes to Ashes
p78
aVI really only liked their older music, not a big fan of their newest album or the one before it but their older tracks are some of my favorite in Deathcore.\u000a\u000aCheyne Stokes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9fMxU4ltGE\u000a\u000aCrewcabanger https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e9Cm8rsGKI\u000a\u000aSonnet of the Wretched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZXYRsDdocE
p79
aVDesolation of Eden, specific track? The Human Condition. That fucking arpeggio/sweep intro is insane!
p80
aVIf you like slamming heavy deathcore, Desolation of Eden. Want that shit a little blackened?  My damnation will be for you. Define towards melodeath- hit ashes to ashes.\u000a\u000aFor songs I'd recommend recreant And Cheyenne strokes from desolation of Eden. I would recommend my damnation and all hail the fallen king from "my damnation".  From. Ashes to ashes I'd recommend \u2026to ashes and Morte aeterna
p81
aVLIFELESS 
p82
aVTheir best songs in my opinion in no particular order not counting the ones you mentioned\u000a\u000a[Don't Ask Don't Tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj1YiefzpRI)\u000a\u000a[Lillith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFAiOzgb8O0)\u000a\u000a[Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZIeNYgZ_hY)\u000a\u000a[Angels Shall Sin, Demons Shall Pray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khmVnxtN4ZM)\u000a\u000a[Crewcabanger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_It7M80CDG4)\u000a\u000a[Lifeless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yFBCOwpzDk)\u000a\u000a[The Human Condition (that intro tho)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFs4JKMZut4)\u000a\u000a[Sonnet of the Wretched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjECjnjl6_Q)\u000a\u000a[All Hail the Fallen King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BH5FcnwNFM)\u000a\u000a[Last Breathe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5YLWFnN2IQ)\u000a\u000aTheir self titled EP and Desolation of Eden are the best for heavy stuff, Evolve is quite progressive, and My Damnation and Ashes to Ashes are both all around quite good. Ashes to Ashes is my personal favorite album from them and in general.
p83
aVTheir album Desolation of Eden was their best imo. It was their darkest, most evil sounding stuff that they put out.\u000a\u000aedit: speaking fo this album, can somebody recommend some albums with a similar guitar tone? [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUHPef9Uhw0) is another example of a song with a similar tone
p84
aVPersonally I enjoy my damnation, try my favorite song from em: Calling in Silence, it even has a guest apperance by Nate former Vocalist of fit for an autopsy
p85
aVAs much as I can't stand their first album, you should give Desolation of Eden a shot. It's the fan favorite afaik.\u000a\u000aThough, if you're going on my personal taste give their new album Ashes to Ashes a shot. It's their best imo. \u000a\u000aIt kind of depends what you want though. Their newer stuff has a much smoother, cleaner sound. With way more melody. Desolation of Eden is much more...dry? I don't know the word for it. But it's also way chuggier. So if you're down with chugs you might like it more.

aV&gt;Help me get into Chelsea Grin!\u000aAm I the only one, who finds this request kind of...stupid?

p93
aVThis video creeps me the fuck out. Not sure why. 
p94
aVBecause it's creepy as fuck.
p95
aVIt might just be me but Rings of Saturn sounds like forced sodomy during an alien invasion.....I can't be the only one. 
p96
aVIsn't that the idea?

aVwretched is not deathcore nor is there any slam in it. if we want to sub-genre it, i would say its tech-melodeath lol. fantastic band, definitely the best on that list. 
p143
aVThere are plenty of slams throughout Son Of Perdition.
p144
aVnot really at all and if they have something similar that doesnt make them a slam band. listen to all of their albums as a whole and then come back and tell me they are a slam-deathcore band lol. they fit neither of those\u000a
p145
aVI suggested them because anyone who likes deathcore and slam will like Wretched. I never said they were a direct fusion of slam death/core. \u000a\u000aSeriously dude, you can fuck right off.

aVI've been hearing this "Slam" thing picking up on social media. What is it? How is it different than Deathcore? Anytime I listen to a Slam band, it just sounds like it's slower Deathcore.
p169
aVSlam is like slow brutal death metal , depending on the band (all the bands posted so far are pretty sweet though)

VMy question, what are some unsigned UK bands we should know about at /r/Deathcore?\u000a\u000aP.S. Can you listen to 30 seconds of my bands new song, our vocalist loves you and is a massive inspiration:\u000ahttp://youtu.be/y5ExzU2a4CM?t=32s\u000a\u000aCheers
p176
aVI like the sound on this EP dude, your vocalist has got a great range of tones. Keep plugging away at it dude!\u000a\u000aFor unsigned/unheard UK bands that you guys should be checking out, I've got a couple!\u000a\u000aShe Must Burn - symphonic blackened overgenre'd deathcore\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay-xT1iIDsI&amp;sns=fb\u000a\u000aWraiths - downtuned doom deathcore\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luc8TVGVZe4\u000a\u000aCreate To Inspire - positive vibes metalcore\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8OTgSqX0pA

aVUpvote for Wraiths. Shit is FILTHY.

aV[deleted]
p179
aVWhy are keyboardists in specifically symphonic deathcore bands always so goddamn attractive..?
p180
aVShe Must Burn is incredible. Thanks for this!
p181
aVI was hella happy to find She Must Burn on Spotify, thanks for introducing me to them!
p182
aVI hear the inspiration, and shit, I dig it. Sounds like he's the next Matty Jones haha.
p183
aVDo you have an opinion on bands that use other means to gain their success? (examples could be Cabin Boy Jumped Ship + Peaked Apparel, Lock &amp; Key etc)\u000a\u000a
p184
aVAt the end of the day, we're all out here trying to get our music to as many people as we can do. Every band has their own methods to promote their songs - but the only way that I can't justify is buying fake youtube views or likes. So long as people genuinely like the music - fair enough.\u000a\u000aYou never heard of a good band that didn't make it; or you wouldn't have heard of them. Shit bands don't make it, because if they were shit people wouldn't listen to it - its all a matter of objective opinion and perspective.
p185
aVWhat would you say are the bands that have been most influential to you?
p186
aVSlipknot, Deftones and in recent years Tom Waits man! I love Corey Taylor, the guy has a way with words and phrases that can really affect you
p187
aVI love the Deftones.
p188
aVCorey Taylor is such an inspirational person. 
p189
aVwhat did lock &amp; key do?
p190
aVHad merch printed and for sale before their EP was even released
p191
aVI see nothing wrong with that, as long as money wasnt put into merch before it went to the EP
p192
aVWhat did Cabin boy and peaked apparel do?
p193
aVWord on the street is that they also pay to get on tours, but idk if that's just shitty rumours.
p194
aVWho the hell is the brains behind all your sweet ass merch?!\u000a\u000alove you guys, keep doing what ya doing and emptying my wallet &lt;3\u000a\u000a#MDMAFIA\u000a\u000aedit: [my merch collection](http://i.imgur.com/9hVZHmh.jpg)
p195
aVHaha, we have a very talented pool of designers we use! Daniel Owen at NEMESIS Design, Ash Evans at ACE Illustration and Tom Bornarel are our favourites!\u000a\u000aWe come up with all the concepts ourselves - if you tell me your favourites, I can tell you who came up with the idea!
p196
aVThe Baphomet tee would have to be my favourite, also do you still sell physical copies of Ecophagy and do you have any Australian sites where I can buy No Hope No Morality, i got merch from 24hundred but they don't have cd's.
p197
aVAh the Baphomet shirt was by our man Robert Borbas - aka Grindesign! He designed a few bits for us way back when, he even put on a show for us in his home town of Budapest.\u000a\u000aWe sold out of Ecophagy years ago - there are still a few copies knocking around that importers in the US purchased then held in warehouses, you can pick those up on eBay. We may do a limited repress in the future! \u000a\u000aAnd NHNM never actually got a physical release in Aus - so your only way is importing it from europe! sorry dude :(
p198
aVkinda lame question, but what are the best tips you can give to upcoming bands? cheers from austria man, you guys rule!
p199
aVPlay as many shows in as many places as you can! Bug promoters and play for free, and eventually enough people will know you that you can ask for some petrol money.\u000a\u000aMy general rule of thumb is that a good band never goes unheard. In this day and age of social media and instant sharing to all your friends, we've never been able to grow as creative people as much as we can right now. Look at the incredible success people like Infant Annihilator/Black Tongue and Lorna Shore have had worldwide because they're writing great music, and people want to share it for them. A lot of the hard work is taken out of being a band these days because your fans will promote your band for you!
p200
aVBozeman or Erian?
p201
aVFuck! If I had to choose:\u000a\u000aSomatic/This Is Exile Bozeman &gt; OTB Erian\u000a\u000aDI Erian &gt; Post-TIE Bozeman
p202
aVare you planning on being a vocalist for as long as you possibly can or are there any other plans for the future? 
p203
aVBeing in a band is really hard on your family, friends and relationship. I love being away, I love playing shows and I love being in a band but it isn't something I'd choose to do forever - I think whilst I'm doing it and MD is worth me putting the people close to me through me being away regularly then I'm gonna keep on doing it. Eventually I'll settle down somewhere, get a real job and start living the grind - but that won't be any time soon!
p204
aVHave to hop on the merch-bandwagon! I own two of your shirts, which I absolutely love. My question for you Matt, what's your favorite MD shirt?
p205
aVThanks so much for picking up merch, it really really helps! You're not by any chance Sara Hultgren, are you? I remember seeing that name crop up when I've been making the postage labels!\u000a\u000aI really really love our logo. We've had 3 or 4 logos in our time, and the latest one is perhaps my favourite piece of artwork we've ever had as a band. Its so recognisable from any distance at any size - and as soon as you see it, you know who's logo it is!
p206
aVSara is my sister! She gave me one of the shirts as a gift, which was fuckin' awesome. That you remember our surname is quite brilliant! Time to pop a pint and listen to In Shadows! 
p207
aVAside from other bands, what is your biggest source of inspiration in lyrics? Big fan from Sweden \u005cm/
p208
aVI get inspiration from all places - I like to write little catchphrases and spin them around, or take a phrase I've heard from somewhere and work a song into what I think it means or what connotations it could have. For instance, I saw a non-attributed quote 'You can't get to heaven if you're raised in hell' and loved it - so I've started writing lyrics for the new album based around that idea
p209
aVHey, what is the best 2014 deathcore album for you (excluding No Hope, No Morality)? Cheers from the Czech Republic!
p210
aVthe best album for me in 2014 is a tough one, but I'd go with Upon A Burning Body - The World Is My Enemy Now. I didn't like it so much on the first listen, but I listen to it almost daily now!
p211
aVAwesome. Someone will be along to sticky this post ASAP. Is the rest of the band not joining you?
p212
aVUnfortunately not, they're all either at work or otherwise engaged so its just little old me!
p213
aVAlright then. I was going to ask your percussionist how he works with the foundation of your music. With such an obvious hardcore influence it must be a challenge for him to keep everything harmonious with the brutal shit you and your guitarists deliver.
p214
aVRichard is very instrumental (pun intended) in the writing of all our songs - he's gifted with keeping feel in his drums, and has a big influence on how riffs play out tonally and the structures of songs which allows him to balance being brutal as hell and having a little bit of hardcore groove in there too!
p215
aVThat's good to hear. His balance of those elements is some of the best in the hardcore-deathcore style IMO. On a different note, I was wondering what it was like for you to feature on Black Tongue's "Coma". It's one of my favourite features of all time. Was there a lot of pressure for you to keep up with Alex's sheer vocal ridiculousness?
p216
aVI'm glad you like it dude! Thank you so much for the kind words.\u000a\u000aHonestly, I was really trying my hardest to divide opinion on that guest spot. I know a lot of people would wanna hear me try and do the most disgusting gutturals and really try to out-heavy myself - but I didn't think that suited the song. They gave me complete free reign to do what I liked on that section, so I decided that I wanted to do something outrageous, something really catchy and something that would stand out from the song but complement it in its own way. So I started off with that hype section, made it ignorant as fuck then moved on to tearing the track up!
p217
aVThanks for the insight. It really shows that your presence in the song is very genuine in that regard. The fact that you're both small-town UK bands really adds to the heart and soul of that song.
p218
aVfavorite band you've played/toured with ? 
p219
aVMy most favourite band musically would have to be Postmortem Promises way back in 2010. I have loved that band since they started, and I had to watch them play every song every single night.\u000a\u000aPersonally, either Thy Art Is Murder or Boris The Blade. We seem to get on really well with aussie bands! It was TAIMs first euro headline tour when we supported them, and it was my 23rd birthday whilst we were away. They made the whole evening really special, bought me a cake and everything. Great guys.
p220
aV[how about my entire collection? haha](http://imgur.com/9hVZHmh)
p221
aVoh mate thank you so much! you don't know how much it means!
p222
aVjust realised i posted this on the wrong comment thread woops haha.\u000a\u000ano worries man, been following you guys since 09! &lt;3
p223
aVBeing someone from Lincolnshire myself (Spalding/fenland to be precise), was it hard to break out of the area, or did you get out of Lincolnshire as soon as possible?\u000aAlso - I thought No Hope No Morality was one of the best albums of the year (seen here: http://www.crashdoubt.co.uk/2014/12/crash-doubt-staff-picks-2015/) - great job dudes!
p224
aVAh a Spalding lad! Nowt but rough lads and cabbages that way, right?\u000a\u000aWe had a big base of friends who happened to be promoters in our early days, so that helped a lot with getting recognised in other cities. Being a promoter helps a lot though - you make friends in other cities, they help you out and you help them out when you can. it works!
p225
aVWell more cabbages than rough dudes these days.\u000aGood to have some insight on what helps young bands get around and out of places with the most terrible scenes going.\u000a(PS - your Peterborough show with Acrania was of the fucking chain!)
p226
aVThanks dude! 
p227
aVHey Matt, big fan of Martyr Defiled, you have been amazing both times I have seen you live. I have two questions. \u000a - Any chance of a headline UK tour this year?\u000a - Are you going to see 36 Crazyfists in Nottingham? \u000aThanks, keep making good music!
p228
aVMan, I wish I could go see 36CF again - they're one of my favourites from when I was younger. And its on my birthday as well! As it is, my girlfriend has arranged some cute shit that I really can't say no to.\u000a\u000aI don't know if we'll be doing a headliner this year - it all depends on how we get on with writing MD3. We don't wanna rush it, so if its done in time - we'll be out there touring and supporting it!
p229
aVShould hit them up in London Glenny ;)
p230
aVMight do man, shall check it out
p231
aVIve been wondering for a while are you guys and AOAA still ignorant to Christ? Just kidding my real question is what band would you bring back that have decided to call it quits?
p232
aVhahaha fucks sake. who knows what happened there!\u000a\u000aI'd love to see a Dreaming In Oceans album. They never got past a 5 song EP and it pains me every time
p233
aVThis is not a dig at your guys at all, fucking love your music and merch.\u000a\u000aI've bought most of your merch BUT I haven't since around Feb of last year as no matter what temp I washed my clothes at they seemed to shrink pretty badly. Have you guys changed 'jumper' provider since thats what I usually bought from you guy?
p234
aVWhat particular brand of jumper were they printed on? We usually use Gildan, which are pretty standard for band merch.. if not, send us an email to md.bigcartel@gmail.com and we'll see if we have any spares we can replace them with!
p235
aVHow do you react to the fan reception of your Lamb of god's cover? I love the song, just wanted to see your opinion on it.\u000aKiller show in Portugal btw!
p236
aVHonestly? We did it for ourselves, cos we love the song and it was a whole lot of fun. If our fans dig it then great - but it was never put out to get a reaction. I'm glad you like it though brother! It means a lot.\u000a\u000aWhich show did you come to in Portugal? That tour was CRAZY
p237
aVLisbon show, my favourite gig of the night.\u000aHope you come back sometime!
p238
aVWhat up mang, cheers from Halifax, Canada.\u000aWhat's your guilty pleasure band?
p239
aVYo! Hopefully we'll get to see you soon!\u000a\u000aI'm just not guilty about any of the really poppy stuff I listen to, but I have to admit I'm a huge t-swift fan. I love her tunes man!
p240
aVIs Dave in the band or out? Just curious because your most recent album is incredible and it would be a bummer if he left since he wrote it
p241
aVAhhh, Dave Trees isn't in MD any more - he left to pursue a teaching career that didn't marry up with the time off we needed him to take.\u000a\u000aWith regards to album writing, we all write most stuff! Ryan in particular has written a large majority of the songs on NHNM. Which are your favourite songs? I can tell you who (mostly) wrote them!
p242
aVObviously I wasn't the one who asked the question but my favourite songs are Demons in the Mist (sorry for picking that as it's the lead track) and I really liked No Hope as well. Do you all write a large portion of your own parts for each song or does one member usually piece together a song then the rest of you sort of flesh it out?
p243
aVDITM and No Hope are very much Ryan songs!\u000a\u000aWe tend to do it the second way - one member will put a song together then we'll all have our input and it'll grow from there.
p244
aVHey Matt. I just started getting into you guys. Demons in the Mist is one of my top 5 metal songs now. Fucking sick stuff. I was wondering what method of support gives you guys the biggest share of the money? iTunes, shirts from you guys, physical CDs, or something else? Keep doing what you do bro. Support from the States! 
p245
aVAh thanks man, and welcome to the MDMAFIA!\u000a\u000aShirts from our merch stores are the biggest share of cash to us - we've tried to have local stores where our biggest fanbases are, so we have a aussie merch store, a US merch store and a UK/Euro one!\u000a\u000ahttp://hivemindmerch.com - US\u000ahttp://24hundred.net - AUS\u000ahttp://impericon.com/uk/martyr-defiled.html - UK/EU
p246
aVWhy no In Shadows live anymore? :(
p247
aVwe're pushing the new stuff man! On support tours, you wanna play your newest material cos its the most relevant to people who haven't heard you before. If we did a headline set we'd definitely play some old stuff!
p248
aVSaw you guys and heard you for the first time at Face Down in the Scala last year at 2am when I was pissed as fuck and I remember having my mind blown by you guys so thanks for that!\u000a\u000aMy question is I'm a Director/Editor based in London and I'm doing Music Videos, but I want to be doing alternative/metalcore/deathcore and I'm doing anything but that these days! What do you reckon is the best way of getting gigs doing videos for you guys/others like you?
p249
aVAh man, that was definitely an experience. Did you see those crazy guys in the main room with the 3 foot mullets?\u000a\u000aYour best way forward is to get a really strong portfolio together and approach bands you wanna work with! We got involved with Zak Pinchin that way - we'd seen a load of his work before, he got in touch and asked if we were looking for any work and he did the Demons video for us, which in turn got him a bunch more work
p250
aVHey matt, long time super fan own a shit load of shirts and up until recently I owned a snapback but fuck who cares, met you a few times in London and Derby and just wanted to say you're a proper decent guy it's been a pleasure to speak to you every time, and just wanted to ask what happened to dave? 
p251
aVHey dude! I'm sure it was a pleasure to speak to you too - I'm terrible with names, but I never forget a face\u000a\u000aDave left to become a teacher! His time off in the school hols didn't work with touring so he had to pick one or the other, which is a shame. I still talk to him all the time, he's a don on Destiny so we're always on PS4 together.
p252
aVah that's great ton hear, I used to play a lot of blops2 with him he's a bit of a FPs Head aye :], safe anyways just wanna end it off by saying keep it up glad to see you guys are making it to the USA after so long you deserve it when you and lorna shore gonna tour the UK? ;D
p253
aVHaha hopefully Lorna Shore get over here very soon! Thanks for the support dude, we all appreciate it so much. Long live the MDMAFIA!
p254
aVThanks for doing this. No Hope No Morality was my favourite deathcore realease of this year, and one of my favourite albuns of the year. 616 was probably my most played track haha\u000a\u000a\u000aAlbum of the year for you? Doesn't need to be deathcore obviously.\u000aAnd favourite mainstream UK rock/metal band?  \u000a\u000a\u000aLooking at Martyr Defiled's fb page looks like you're hitting America with The Last Ten Seconds of Life, (btw their new album sounds sweet) good luck with that, and next time you visit Portugal, don't forget to play a show in Oporto pls 
p255
aVAh thanks man, its great to hear you enjoyed it so much!\u000a\u000aAlbum of the year for me is probably LP1 by FKA Twigs. I'm so into this future soul sound at the moment, I love it! My favourite mainstream UK rock/metal band is Bring Me The Horizon, I love their new album and I love Drown.\u000a\u000aWe might be announcing an american tour soon ;) Yeah we wanna come back to Portugal so bad! I love your country, we had an amazing time last summer
p256
aV&gt;My favourite mainstream UK rock/metal band is Bring Me The Horizon, I love their new album and I love Drown.\u000a\u000aI'm glad you said that. I love them, but it seems like a lot of people here in /r/deathcore shit on them since they've moved so far away from deathcore. Sempiternal is fantastic and if their new album is even half as good it'll be one of the best of the year.
p257
aV[deleted]
p258
aVSempiternal came out early 2013 and they just recently put out Drown
p259
aVHey man! huge fan,you absolutely killed it in cardiff with black tongue and at download,and I can't wait to see you again! But,if you could only listen to 3 albums and watch 3 films for the rest of your life,what would they be?\u000a
p260
aVThanks dude! Great to hear from you, thanks for watching us at download especially.\u000a\u000a3 albums:\u000a\u000aFrank Ocean - Channel Orange /\u000aDeftones - White Pony /\u000aEditors - An End Has A Start\u000a\u000a3 movies:\u000a\u000aBladerunner / \u000aDrive / \u000aInterstellar
p261
aVI love to ask random questions so: What's your favorite food?
p262
aVBurritos!
p263
aVOh man, I love those too!
p264
aVhow do you have your burrito? what meat?
p265
aVThe meat is like half pig and half cow (no idea how you call that in English honestly haha). And they somehow look like this: http://i.imgur.com/wQE1q2y.png\u000a
p266
aVAny advice you can give to gigging bands to take that next step in their career?
p267
aVShow swap, play for nothing, and never give any less than 100% into your shows no matter how many people are watching you.\u000a\u000aIts always the shows with the least people that ending up meaning the most. We once played a show in Vienna, Austria to 5 people - we could have mugged the show off and not tried, but we thought fuck it we're gonna give it our all. Every time we go back to Vienna, those same 5 guys are there with 5, 10, 15 friends. And they come back with more friends. We know one of them so well, we've watched him find his wife and have his first child - he was only 17 when we first met him!\u000a\u000atl;dr - give 100% every time because you never know how much it will benefit you
p268
aVThanks so much dude!\u000aAnything you can say for online promotion? I noticed the video you did on your facebook 'when the breakdown hits and you with your boys' and I thought it was a class idea for promotion.
p269
aVYeah little viral videos are ace to make up, but you have to do it sparingly. You don't wanna be known as the band that drops their track on every viral video ever, but its also good to have a bit of fun now and again
p270
aVFew questions here: Hope you don't mind!\u000aFavourite rappers?\u000aDo you like any music in the charts/radio 1 music?\u000aWhat's your drink of choice on a night out?\u000aAny tattoo's you regret?\u000aEver been arrested?\u000aAny uk clothing lines you're loving right now?\u000a\u000aThanks dude!
p271
aVNo worries mate, thanks for getting involved!\u000a\u000aFavourite rappers: Action Bronson, Joey Badass, Kendrick Lamar, Biggie!\u000a\u000aChart Music: Man I love all of it. I'm a sucker for a catchy song!\u000a\u000aTattoos: I honestly don't regret any of them - not even the bloody frijj logo on the back of my leg, although I'm not sure why I don't regret that one haha\u000a\u000aNever been arrested! \u000a\u000aUK clothing lines: SABBC every day man! I also really like Represent. \u000a
p272
aVHi Matt, big fan of your band! Seen you various times at Ghostfest! I was just wondering if your bassist still works at Topman in Lincoln? I had a slightly cringe moment there with him on time... Haha
p273
aVThanks man, great to hear from you!\u000a\u000aHaha no, he doesn't! I work at Vodafone in the waterside though ;)
p274
aVAhh nice! I don't go to Lincoln as much as I used to anymore... But keep up the good work and hopefully you guys will get big enough so you can leave Vodafone! 
p275
aVwill the 'step off the boks son'' sweater ever be reprinted? 
p276
aVWe'll reprint anything if theres enough demand for it bro!
p277
aVWhat's up Matt? Three questions.\u000a\u000a1. Which UK metal/hardcore bands inspired you to start up MD? I think I heard you talk about a Dreaming in Oceans tattoo once. \u000a\u000a2. What's the prisoner about on the art for No Hope No Morality?\u000a\u000a3. Which do you think is Martyr Defiled's heaviest song?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p278
aVHey dude!\u000a\u000a1. Yeah I do have a DIO tattoo - they were around after we started though. If I had to name 3 bands it would be Postmortem Promises, The Argent Dawn and Eternal Lord pre-Ed Butcher. I listened to those bands a lot in 2007, just before MD came together.\u000a\u000a2. The whole concept for NHNM is that if you can't get to heaven because you are born with original sin and can never be free of that, why would you try to be a good person when being a good person is never going to be enough? So the prisoner on the front cover is a representation of all the shit that we deal with in our lives, and the bag over his head is his blindness or apathy to whats going on around him.\u000a\u000a3. I think the ending of LVCIFER is the heaviest thing we've ever done. Every time we drop it live it makes me wanna punch someone in the face. I love it!\u000a
p279
aVAwesome. Old Eternal Lord slays. Love the concept for the album. 
p280
aVJust wanted to say that the into for No Morality is the sickest intro in this genre of music. Fucking rock on.
p281
aVThanks bro, glad you like it!
p282
aVHey Matt, good to see you on here! I met you in Munich at Backstage last time you played in the summer when I was with my asian buddy you know from back home haha. Any plans to come back here this summer?
p283
aVAh man great to hear from you again! How's wen doing?\u000a\u000aHopefully we'll get a couple DE shows but its looking more likely we'll do a proper EU run next autumn. That can all change though, its never set
p284
aVAh thats awesome! We'll definitely come again, as long as you play Infidels this time ;) \u000a\u000aWen is doing great now and is visiting his fam in China right now with his british wifey he met back in the UK. Cheers man and good luck with the next steps!
p285
aVFavourite welsh fan? (come on we both know the answer here)
p286
aVAhaha Joe, you don't even have to ask
p287
aVWhat was the deal with Attack Attack slagging you off, and the Your Demise thing?
p288
aVHonestly, no idea with AA! The YD thing was just a rip, they took it personally, we ironed it out between us and its all love now.

aVYou gonna be playing ghostfest/announcing a UK tour any time soon?
p290
aVNothing in the works at the moment man, but hopefully something comes up!
p291
aVWhat's your advice for people out there trying to learn how to do hardcore vocals? 
p292
aVI genuinely have no idea about how to develop the techniques people are doing these days, like vocal fry and false chord stuff - but there are loads of great youtube videos out there with loads of advice and help for you, so watch them and get practising!\u000a\u000aOne thing I will say is that you'll never get your voice to sound exactly like someone else's - it took me a long time to embrace the sound of my own vocals rather than trying to make them sound like Alex Erian or Mitch Lucker.
p293
aVHow are the guys from infant annihilator/black tongue? 
p294
aVBest dudes! Very different as real people though, they're quiet and reserved guys rather than the mad internet personalities that you would expect from them
p295
aVSend me to hell cuz I don't give a fuck. Best line in death core? 
p296
aVDo you feel more comfortable with your vocals now compared to your earlier stuff? How do you do your guttural vocals?
p297
aVYeah loads more comfortable now. I feel like I've grown into my range a lot more, which I think means I sound a lot more like me now rather than me trying to sound like someone else.\u000a\u000aGutturals are all about the mouth position and diaphragm control for me. I've been learning to do the false chord thing with your cheeks with some ace results, I'm excited to record again and try out some new shit!

Reminds me a lot of The Discovery by BOO.  \u000a\u000aThe new guy isn't as brutal as Brandon was.  Still good though.  Those BGVs were nice during the break.\u000a\u000aTasty riff choices by Marc\u000a\u000aEchoing what some Youtuber said, this song lost that raw feel from TCMC because Keene's productions at the time (Pretty sure this applies to Autotheism, too) don't feature sampled drums and we're now listening to 2015 hyper-compressed sampled/super perfect [&amp; probably] quantized drums.  A big factor here, too, is the style of mixing: pushing the RMS levels, as opposed to leaving it more 'organic' (dynamic).  \u000a\u000aIt's a matter of taste - some people prefer the TCMC/[id] style mixes vs. The modern super polished djentcore.  I personally enjoy both styles. However, the artform in the mix IMO is: \u000a\u000a* a. making the organic mix sound so dynamic and punchy, that you don't mind that it's not totally sampled/super high RMS mixing.  TCMC does this, so does The Faceless' Planetary Duality. \u000a* b. making the modern mix sound real.  Circle of Contempt's Artifacts In Motion is a nice example of this.  \u000a\u000aMost go for the polished sound but don't put too much effort to make it sound real (see: Latest BOO album) \u000a\u000a\u000aOverall, I really enjoyed listening to the song and I'm happy that I have an album to look forward to from one of my favorite bands\u000a\u000a\u000aTL:DR Nice groove + nice harmonic minor riffs + punchy drums  = good listen\u000a\u000ae: nice bass arp @ 3:03 I didn't catch on the first couple listens
p468
aVHate to be that guy but the Common Man's Collapse's drums were all programmed. Same as Born of Osiris' "the New Reign" EP, aswell as The Faceless' "Akeldama" EP (all produced by Keene around the same time)\u000a\u000aThe drums in Pheonix are live and not quantised, just heavily processed. It was engineered by Diego from Volumes. Diego is an absolute beast at producing the big,  heavily compressed mixes, as is evident in Subject Zero, and both Volumes' &amp; Chelsea Grin's latest albums.
p469
aV&gt;the Common Man's Collapse's drums were all programmed. Same as Born of Osiris' "the New Reign" EP, aswell as The Faceless' "Akeldama" EP (all produced by Keene around the same time)\u000a\u000aHow do you know this?
p470
aVNot Akeldama but Keene said that the drums in Planetary Duality were natural but were just overcompressed and he regrets it.
p471
aVTomorrow we die alive was pretty good imo :/
p472
aVThe part around 1:20? kinda reminds me of Complex Terms by The Human Abstract. 
p473
aVIt's been killing me since the first listen. My mind kept wandering towards that riff, but I couldn't name where it was from.\u000a\u000aIt kind of sounds similar, but not enough for me to think of plagiarism. This stuff happens some times.
p474
aVI see what you mean, I like Complex Terms much more though
p475
aVWell duh it's THA
p476
aV2015 is the year, i'm feeling it
p477
aVWe both know that's not going to happen... :_: 
p478
aVInstrumental is pretty good, but Brandon's vocals blow this out of the water.
p479
aVThis song sounds more Metalcore for sure. 
p480
aVThe lyrics are 3deep5me. \u000a\u000aThe song could have been 40 seconds long, and it would have left the same impression. \u000a\u000aWay to repetitive, not interesting enough, and there is too much open chugging. \u000a\u000aI like the screamer a lot more, though. 
p481
aVEXACTLY. the song was boring. I expect way more from VoM. Marc isn't writing as many riffs. Just boring chugs. 
p482
aVThis is only one song, wait for the album to determine if he isn't writing as many riffs anymore
p483
aVI agree, but I haven't been impressed with their stuff since TCMC and id
p484
aVBetter than I was expecting.
p485
aVI'm alright with the new vocalist. Not too big on his lows but that's just because I like Brandon's more. \u000a\u000aI love me some of them Okubo riffs. \u000a\u000aInterested to see what they come out with next.
p486
aVLyrics are repetitive, everything else is perfect.
p487
aVExcept vocals
p488
aVHopefully this is one of the more metalcorey songs, not that its bad but, would like to see some technical prowess that im used from these guys.
p489
aVI liked everything including the new vocals, although I feel the old vocals were way better. It's just that the song is too repetitive, I hope the rest of the album is more technical and progressive. Otherwise, pretty sweet.
p490
aVAnd I need new boxers.
p491
aVThis band hasn't progressed enough for my taste. I'll stick to what I know and like, TCMC and id.\u000a\u000aIt's not bad, but boring, it sounds like every other release but with a new vocalist. 
p492
aVEclipse was nice
p493
aVthey new vocalist is ass
p494
aVfirst Make them Suffer now Veil, how disappointing 
p495
aVMake them suffers song was good though :-/
p496
aVThe vocals as sooo much better than the last douche's.
p497
aVEveryone is entitled to their opinions, but what made Brandon a douche? I've met him after shows and he's always been the nicest guy.
p498
aVDoesn't give out high fives in between songs. Marc however, coolest fuckin guy. Makes raptor faces while playing and shit.
p499
aVAs someone who has met both of them numerous times, Brandon is actually one of the nicest guys I've ever met (Danny is actually the nicest member of VoM though), and Marc has been a huge douchebag every time I've met him. Marc *always* gives his fans the cold shoulder after shows. When I see VoM, I don't even try to talk to him after the show anymore. Last time I saw them, I walked up to him, and said, "Hey Marc, you guys played great tonight!" and he literally just turned around and walked away. But Brandon and Danny always drink a crapload of beer with me and talk baseball and shit (Danny's a Cardinals fan, Brandon's a Cubs fan, always makes for a fun conversation, especially when I watched Game 7 of the 2011 World Series with them, because I'm a Cardinals fan too). But yeah, Brandon is super nice. Sad to see him out of VoM.
p500
aVHuh. I've met them before and Marc was nice. Got a picture with him after the show and he talked to me for a bit. They were all nice dudes, signed my poster and CD that I bought. This was in like 2012 though.
p501
aVThe first time I saw them was right around when Brandon joined. I'm jealous that Marc was nice to you though. His guitar playing was very influential on me, so it was a huge bummer to basically be 100% ignored by one of my guitar idols. He was even like that back when they were playing at bars and record stores and shit in my area before TCMC dropped, which sucks.
p502
aVI think it all depends on whats going on when you meet them. Sometimes they're in a rush to pack up and stuff. \u000a\u000aI met Misha Mansoor after a show one time. I tried to talk to him but he just said he was in a rush and left right away without talking. I was pretty disappointed. But i've talked to him other times after that and he was nice, so I guess it all depends on the circumstances. \u000a\u000aOh and I also met Jason Richardson once (during Chelsea Grin era) and he wouldn't talk to me.
p503
aVYeah, Jason isn't talkative either. He wouldn't talk to me in BoO or CG. As a musician though, that just pisses me off. When my band is done playing, I will walk to anyone and everyone who tries to talk to me. I mean fuck, they paid money to see me, the least I can do is give them some of my time and talk to them when they want to talk.
p504
aVHave you toured at all? What is the name of your band? Maybe i've seen you
p505
aVI haven't toured more than regionally throughout the Midwest. I'm currently writing material with a new band where I play guitar and do backing vocals, but I used to be the lead vocalist of a band called Snogulated Pig (the one that did small regional tours).

asVDeathcore with open headphones?
p568
(lp569
VI listen to Deathcore on my Grado SR80i headphones. They're open backed and very good (highly recommended by audiophiles) for fast paced and heavy music. The bass response is very good, but not overpowering, and the trebel response is sparkly and tight (which is great for guitar solos and cymbals). I own a lot of headphones, most of which cost about double the price of my Grados, but my Grados are still my favourite pair. The only disadvantage is the comfort, which is not awful but not amazing either, the headphones can begin to itch your ears slightly after about 3 hours of listening. That's my opinion, although there are plenty of other great pairs of open headphones out there. 
p570
aVThanks, I'll check those out
p571
aVSwear by Audio Technica ath-m50x with any $150.00 + DAC. I posted a thread just like this, I was recommended this set up, went with it, and it really does sound incredible. It's also great for other genres. 
p572
aVI use Sennheiser HD558s. They're great, uber comfortable, good price, and they sound great.
p573
aVwhat's your budget?\u000a\u000aI'm using the HD 650's and they're incredible, but they're about 350 bucks.
p574
aVI'm on a pretty low budget, I ended up ordering the hd 439. Probably not the greatest but will definitely still sound better than my apple EarPods 
p575
aVDon't get studio monitors, they are amazing but you will be disappointed if you'r just listening to music, get something with good bass and just know most deathcore doesn't have the best production quality so if your on good headphones now you might not notice much of a difference.
p576
aVThanks!

aV??? bands have great production quality now days. Look at within the ruins 
p578
aVI don't know if it's the production quality or the inability I have with messing with EQ, but everything just sounds like shit in my car.  \u000aToo much noise and the speakers can't handle it IMO. Voices are always drawn out
p579

asVConsumption - Seven Instruments [OFFICIAL LYRIC VIDEO]
p682
(lp683
VIt's like he doesn't like children or something...\u000a\u000aIn all seriousness, this is pretty bad. The instruments are boring and the lyrics are cringey at best.\u000a\u000aProduction is decent though. So, there's that, at least.
p684
aV"Basically this album is a far more demented version of the Charles Manson story. It follows the downfall of two best friends (Adam and Anna) who have extreme home-life issues. The two decide to follow closely behind a seemingly harmless role-model named Benjamin. Through the use of drugs and extreme persuasion, he is able to manipulate the pair, along with a few other kids, into committing malicious and hateful deeds. From cultic ritual to kidnapping, torture to decapitation, it becomes blatantly clear that these kids are willing to do anything to please their leader. I hope you enjoy experiencing this story as much as I enjoyed crafting it. This is The Divine Ruination." - Gage Earls (vocals) of Consumption\u000a\u000aThe drums are programmed and the guitar, bass and vocals are recorded in their room. Jordan Becker (mixed it, wrote instruments, programmed the drums &amp; he's the Guitarist/Bassist) has only played for a few months :-) Sorry you couldn't dig it though!

aVI have to be honest, I liked this band, but not THAT much. Then "Phenomena" came out, and I haven't stopped listening to them. Now I've gone back and I'm blasting "Invade" and "Elite" just as much. So groovy.

aVIm so excited for Lorna Shore's full length album they're releasing in 2015. They been recording it very recently according to their facebook page. \u000a\u000aLorna Shore is by far my favorite band at the moment (specifically the Maleficium EP) and it isn't even close.\u000a\u000aIll be sure to check out your suggestions

aVTo be fair, pretty much all Rings of Saturn will never get old. But yes, they have a lot of unique sounds they bring to this genre.
p821
aVI'm seeing these guys when they come into town with As Blood Runs Black and I have a question, how good are they live? I remember hearing rumors that they can't play as fast as they do on the album but I think that was a bunch of bullshit. 
p822
aVWhen I've seen them, they absolutely kill it. I was blown away. It's worth noting they aren't playing anything off the new album this tour though. 
p823
aVAh that's a bummer, still excited though 
p824
aVThe whole not playing as fast as they record is a myth(maybe?) that spawned when people started saying they record at half speed and then speed it up, I haven't personally been able to see them live but plenty of my friends have and always tell me they play perfectly fine. [Lucas Mann is awesome and knows how to play the stuff he writes just fine and has addressed the nay sayers plenty of times](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfCYgorqgLA).(Skip to 16:10 to see the informational bit)

V[Aversions Crown - Tyrant - Hollow Planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fz7TryH6ZA)  \u000a  Holy shit fuck damn.  This album blindsided me.  I wasn't hyped for this release at all.  Didn't even notice it too much until it was released.  Decided to give it a listen.  Goddamn.  Fast, technical, heavy.  Just plain disgusting sickness.  One of my favorite aspects of it are the atmospheric flourishes added with the guitar work.  The breakdowns are just pure sickness also.  Definitely fuckin' awesome.

Martyr Defiled keep their formula: heavy, with some hardcore here and there, memorable and with simple songstructures most of the time. There's a reason why the chorus from 616 was stuck in my head all year, these guys just know how to write good deathcore songs.
p836
aV[Enterprise Earth - 23 EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da6_cg0qcVM) Why? Well for one thing Dan Watson is at the helm of this five piece that also includes highly skilled guitarists and surprisingly the drummer of famous non deathcore band Lacuna Coil. Now Watsons vocals just flow perfectly with the fantastic drums and the unique guitar to provide an atmospheric journey of sound. This EP may only be 16 minutes long but it is one of the finest 16 minutes in deathcore. The Lyrics give an otherworldly vibe and make you feel like you are being abducted by aliens and being enlightened to all the dark secrets in this world. This EP is a masterpiece and deserves to be AOTY

aVAshes To Ashes \u2013 Chelsea Grin\u000a\u000aFor me it's the best Chelsea Grin album so far and one of the best deathcore albums ever released.

Plus it has got an immense amount of play time (over 1 hour).\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_bKpbiMz3A&amp;list=PLQxBXGpNJ2pLZZ7QvxUjWsRrG3Iy5IhVm

This album crushed almost every other in terms of vocals and possibly lyrics. Luke Griffin's vocals are pretty unique in this genre and fast as hell. Also the topic of the songs (consumerism, propaganda, anti-authoritarian, anti-war) are not the typical "death and darkness" lyrical content that this genre typically shows.

aV[Dysphoria - The Apogee](http://dysphoriametal.bandcamp.com/album/the-apogee)      \u000aTheir  stuff before this didn't really stick with me as much, but this album totally changed that. It's absolute chaos given music structure. It's *almost* as if Danza came back, not quite, but the next best thing for me
p852
aVLugal Ki En - Rings of Saturn\u000a\u000aDid not really know this band until their release of this album, holy shit this album. Rings of Saturn has always been technical, fast and pure bad ass. But I feel this album really showed that, the vocals are also improved. I swear Ian Bearer has a mindbending range now. This album also features different drummers from other bands like, aaron kitcher from infant annihilator. The general theme of this album is really intresting, taking on after aliens ivade space (in a nutshell). Really great feel to this album in total, I love the vocals, the amazing guitar work, techincality and pretty much everything from this album, nothing bad to say against it, honestly!

p855
aVI say disqualify this album. Amidst the allegations of digital manipulation &amp; to the server degree. The album initially blew my mind, but if it's a computer playing, Fuck that. I listen to metal for musicianship
p856
aVWhat the hell are you talking about? You know they've had those stupid allegations for every album they've made right? 
p857
aVHaha. Who else even received these kinds of accusations? I watched a video the other day of that Lucas dude straight up milli vanilli with a midi playing thru the input and trying to pass that shit off. The album is masterfully written, there's credit due there but it's fucking disappointing when you scrutinize the whole thing is what the Hell I'm saying.
p858
aVThey've faced these accusations before and they've played live shows where they hit everything they hit in the record. If quantization disqualifies an album then I don't think any album can be on this list. This was album of the year for me.
p859
aV[Seditionist - Retract/Relapse](http://youtu.be/2ubHReOVgDI)\u000a\u000aCriminally underrated release this year. Clocks in at 25 minutes and includes an intro and 2 instrumental interlude tracks. Might seem like an EP with filler but it really plays through like a cohesive album. The "filler" tracks are beautifully composed piano or guitar pieces that somehow don't sound out of place sprinkled between the raw aggression of the rest of the album.\u000a\u000aThis album will satisfy the entire deathcore palette. From fast blasting with high shrieking vocals, to old school hardcore 2 step with yelling, to punk riffs with melody, to absolutely crushing breakdowns and deep growls. While I think it will be tough to top Rings Of Saturn or Aversions Crown this year, Seditionist had one of the best releases of 2014 in my opinion. *Retract/Relapse* is a great step up from their solid debut EP *Memento Mori* and should solidify them on any deathcore fans watch list.

aVi really prefer the old version, that whole EP is so good.\u000a\u000athese guys had so much potential, then just went downhill for me personally
p865
aVI guess a lot of things happened when they started to go back and forth between Deathcore to death metal and whatever the last EP was (Some people say hardcore and some people say it's something else).

asVCollin from Aversions crown is stepping down.
p888
(lp889
VI think Colin fits the frontman image better  but Poida has some, if not the best vocals in Australia next to CJ. 
p890
aVI'm just hope that Poida is able to keep working with I, Valiance (although that's probably unlikely). Their new EP is so sick 
p891
aVIV stated on facebook that he left for Aversions Crown.
p892
aVWell that's just phenominally disappointing...
p893
aVyep, I literally just started listening to the EP like 3 days ago and it blew me away, then today I saw that their vocalist was moving to AC, great for AC but I hope that the vocalist that fills in for IV is good, he has some big shoes to fill
p894
aVThey're definitely going to have to face a departure of style, though. I'm sure whomever they find will live up to fan expectations, but even still, the particular atmosphere and intensity of The Reject Of Humanity is really catalyzed by Mark's vocals.
p895
aVDude filling in is actually a decent vocalist, used to play in Arbour Lane and has filled in on the odd thy art show. 
p896
aVI'm pretty bummed, but hopefully they get someone else who can hang
p897
aVI'm ok with this, seeing as Mark is truly brutal as fuck, but I am disappointed to see him leave I, Valiance. Their new EP is fucking amazing. And it really sucks that Colin's leaving at all. He was becoming one of my favourite vocalists.
p898
aVI, Valiance had potential to become the best deathcore band from Australia, but Aversions Crown are already top 3 so i don't know how to feel about this.
p899
aVAm I correct in assuming Thy Art is Murder is either #1 or 2?
p900
aVCorrect. #2
p901
aVAlright, I'll bite. Who's #1?\u000a\u000a*I swear to CJ if you say Parkway Drive...*
p902
aVMake Them Suffer.\u000a\u000aNeverbloom &gt; Hate, but Infinite Death/Adversary &gt; Neverbloom. I like to think that Let it go song didn't happen.
p903
aVThat's an interesting take. I personally like Hate far more than Neverbloom, but as far as deathcore goes, I reckon Neverbloom is easily one of, if not the best-composed album of the genre. I'd still put Thy Art at the #1 slot for Aussie bands, but Make Them Suffer surely doesn't get enough credit. \u000a\u000aA Night In Texas also deserves to be somewhere on the list, IMO.
p904
aVNeverbloom is one of the better composed albums in all of music in my opinion, not just deathcore 
p905
aVI think hate had a few better single songs. But infinite death was better as a whole.
p906
aV(Parkway Drive is metalcore)
p907
aVYes, thank you for explaining my joke.
p908
aVGreat move from Mark Poida! Cant wait to hear what Aversions will be like, but i Prefer the I, Valiance EP to last two Aversions albums,  that was special

aVAn aborted memory holy shit talk about throw back. I saw them at their first show then the last show I saw them at they head lined it and that was right after Lorna Shore played August 8th 2013!

Such a good night that was i will always remember the guy who just came out of the stall in the bathroom and asked if I wanted my nose reset haha. 
p930
aVOCEANO'S BACKGROUND IS A DIFFERENT SHADE AND IT REALLY BOTHERS ME.
p931
aVThat's unlikely because I took all the logos, made their backgrounds transparent, and put them on a single, black background. Maybe I just can't see it on my computer, maybe you can show a screenshot?
p932
aVI can vouch for her.
p933
aVDo you mean the whiteness of the Oceano logo is a different shade? Because I really can't see how the single black background I applied would be different JUST under the Oceano logo.
p934
aVhttp://imgur.com/261l4R3\u000a\u000aI'm guessing your oceano layer has slipped over top of your BG layer.

aVIt's completely different dude, you should really sort out your monitor haha

aVDamn it! And I can't see it in the screenshot because I still see it through my monitor. ;_;\u000a\u000aEdit: WOW, I turned up my screen brightness and holy shit. That is annoying! I fixed it and put a new link up.
p937
aVHey can you tell me how you made this? Id love to make one of my own
p938
aVThat question is very hard to answer.   \u000a&amp;nbsp;  \u000a\u000aStep 1: I either found pictures of logos via searching Google images, or I found them on the bands' Facebook pages or I'd have to cut them out from any picture with the logo on it like a tour picture or album cover.  \u000a\u000aStep 2: I made all the logos white because I knew I wanted it on a black background. And then I gave the logos a transparent background.\u000a  \u000aStep 3: This is where most of the time is spent. I added a 1920x1080 black background, and then loaded all my logos into Photoshop and spent a few hours re-sizing and moving them around until they all fit together.  \u000a&amp;nbsp;  \u000a\u000a\u000aI can't teach you all the Photoshop skills for it, but I taught myself how to do all the stuff I know with the help of some searches and videos.

aVPossession by Whitechapel.\u000a
p965
aVThis. Every time. 
p966
aVThy Art Is Murder and Rings Of Saturn. So they get to experience two completely different styles.
p967
aVReally depends on who asks. For example if it's a Slipknot fan then I'd show them early Whitechapel or Carnifex. If it's a non-metal musician (like they play an instrument but not in a metal style) I'd show them Veil of Maya, maybe early Born of Osiris. If it's a punk fan I'd show them The Acacia Strain. All other categories I think it pretty much doesn't matter, they will regard it as terrible noise no matter which band it is.\u000a\u000aBut what would I consider to be the best example of deathcore? Infant Annihilator.
p968

aVI've recently been getting really into Attila. I never used to like the whole "party-core" but the breakdowns and vocal screams that Fonz does is pretty good IMO.

I don't like the whole rap thing with attila and I don't like the whole fast paced high pitched vocals. but the breakdowns and lows of both are what keep me listing cause damn it's brutal!! \u000a\u000aas far as everything goes i would rate Attila at a 7.8/10 and THG at a 7.9/10.

But there's no spot for the bass to kick in because it's already going. It's a good sound/tone but does it at the expense of some dynamics.

p1127
asVAny bands like Whitechapel?
p1128
(lp1129
VDepends what era of Whitechapel you're into.\u000a\u000aThe Somatic Defilement (10/10 best era) is pretty much as "deathcore" as it gets. Basically just shovelling "core" influences into a modernized death metal sound to get that crushing effect. Try bands like Separatist, Aversions Crown, AngelMaker, Strychnia, A Night In Texas, Xehanort, Hester Prynne, and (obviously) Thy Art Is Murder to get a feel for what basically became of that.\u000a\u000aAfter that, they refined it. Made it a little boring, IMO, but none can deny their subsequent albums were masterpeices in their own right, and PhillyBo cemented his place as one of the best deathcore vocalists of all time. For this era, try stuff that is noticeably influenced by Whitechapel in general: (early) Chelsea Grin, The Dialectic, Oceano, Chamber Of Malice, Acrania, Ingested, Infant Annihilator, Obliterationist, Lorna Shore, and Rings Of Saturn (for the groove).\u000a\u000aFinally, their new stuff. I like it, although it seems polarizing amongst deathcore fans. It's a little proggy but stays true to the nature of the beast, so to speak. Check out bands like Ovid's Withering, Shadow Of The Colossus, Humanity's Last Breath, Improvidence, and I, Valiance. None of them really seem reminiscient of Whitechapel's influence at first listen, but pay close attention to the grooves, dynamic shifts, and incorporation of progressive elements. You'll hear it.
p1130
aVThank you for a real answer. I love Somatic Defilement and I agree that that is their best album. I would love their new album if more of their songs sounded like Fall of the Hypocrites. I will definitely check out those bands!  
p1131
aVNew Whitechapel really seems to suffer from taking one too many listens to really get into it. It's solid stuff, but that first spin through is so awkward because it's such a departure from their previous stuff.

aVCheck out the band Overthrower- The free world.

p1183
(lp1184
VIt's great!
p1185
aVLove it, it's a little cringey at times but that contributes to the appeal for me. I tend to gravitate to bands who don't take themselves too seriously. Also think that while they don't add much, the trap/hip hop elements are well placed and not overdone. Definitely more emphasis on melodic verses than in FSU, which isn't bad.
p1186
aVIt's fun. It's what Attila should be. \u000a\u000aThe intro to Sour D is fucking great. I wish it had more of the trap moments. And the random Rings of Saturn-ish weedly bit in Sohar Azul I: Visionary. I like the line "I"m not the devil, do you see me wearin' prada?". \u000a\u000aThe rapping could use some work though. Both the screamed rapping and clean rapping. 
p1187
aVExactly how I feel. Saud is an amazing vocalist, but so is Fronz. They chose to go a similar route, but I feel Attila missed the mark while The Holy Guile nailed it. 
p1188

aVI love all of this. All of it exept for one.\u000a\u000aSymphony of Horror.\u000a\u000aHorror.\u000a\u000a*Horror...*\u000a\u000aOn second thought, not such a bad album title after all. I was just overthinking it. Truly, this album is fantastic, and while I am EXTREMELY biased on the grounds of black metal being my favourite kind of metal and also having been waiting for your full-length ever since I first heard your music like fucking MONTHS ago, I am confident in saying that you guys are on the path to something amazing. \u000a\u000aThe production, which was my main issue with the previous bits I heard from you, has improved drastically and it's wonderful. It makes it sound so strikingly grandiose while still having a really raw, blackened edge to it. The thing I love the most about it, is that throughout so much of the album, it's like the music doesn't want you to know how you feel about it. Whenever a dark but beautiful melody swings by and leads into a chaotic and disjointed passage of epic riffs and (albiet a *slight* bit overly-programmed-sounding) blast beats, it's like being thrown into a whole other musical world again. It gives the sense of a very powerful compositional vision, and seeing how that translates into the production is really quite impressive.\u000a\u000aThe vocals have also gotten a lot better, or at least have found their place in the music perfectly. They lack a certain kind of depth, which takes away a bit from the deathcore aspects, but adds tenfold to the blackened atmosphere, and it definitely works out in their favour. My only criticism is that I think the vocals could do a better job of flowing *with* the melodies at times. They already compliment and contrast them where they should, and in quite an epic fashion, but I'd really like to hear them try to follow and harmonize with the guitar and keyboard melodies more. Kind of like how Into Infernus does it, or how early Dissection did. \u000a\u000aAll things considered, amazing record. I'll likely be buying it soon, and definitely recommending it to whoever might be interested.
p1240
aVThanks so much! I'm really glad people are liking it, we worked very hard on it and hearing people like you who praise it makes it all worthwhile. If/when you do buy it, i'll send you a free copy of Catacombs if you end up getting a physical (Just leave your username in a note at checkout). Thanks again man, keep it metal \u005cm/
p1241
aVI got the Catacombs EP some months back and really enjoyed it as I'm a sucker for the symphonic stuff.  This is no exception.  I like the fact that it actually sounds evil.  Lots of bands try to pull that off, but the way the production is it sounds like the real deal.  Definitely good stuff.

p1311
asVWhy 18+ concerts?
p1312
(lp1313
Vthe 18+ shows are just the ones at bars/clubs
p1314
aVonly thing comming to my mind is because some venues are selling alcohol.. 
p1315
aVThe sell of alcohol in this bars it´s the problem of the restricted and i would like to change to 16 years old because there a lot of less 18 that listening any type of music.
p1316
aVUS here. Almost every venue I've been in has served alcohol and not been 18+. I've never even heard of this practice in the states. 
p1317
aVWell I am from Australia and Deathcore bands usually play a separate AA shows as well as 18+ ones . Its usually smaller rock bands, prog rock/metal, metal (genres apart from metalcore/hardcore/deathcore) that don't do all ages shows often. Not many underage people turn up if they do anyway. 
p1318
aVcuz kids fucking suck
p1319
aVI would assume it has something to do with the nature of the vocals. Lot's of swearing/adult themes. If the albums of the bands have parental advisory warnings the venue might enforce 18+ rules. Mosh pits could also be dangerous, especially for younger, smaller people and the venues may want to avoid a lawsuit because a kid got hurt. And of course, many venues, especially smaller ones where these shows are usually held sell alcohol. However I have been to shows when i was under 18 where liquor was sold. Those are my thoughts anyway. The way I see it, if kids can go see shows where girls are wearing skimpy outfits, singing about wanting cock and guys are rapping about drugs and shooting people, why are metal shows given these restrictions often? Well, that's my two cents. \u005cm/ Rock on.
p1320
aVSo it is mostly the owner of the club who does not want to have problems with lawsuits, right? On the other hand owners of the venues and promoters of the concerts loose profit because of these restrictions. I think there are a lot of underaged fans of these genres.\u000a\u000aThanks for replies, it is interesting. I just could not imagine that happening in my country because famous metal bands usually play at decent places and also alcohol is no argument here because it is sold literally everywhere and nobody can forbid you to go somewhere just because of the fact that alcohol is sold there.
p1321
aVThis is guy is completely wrong so don't listen to him. In the States if you want to sell alcohol at all ages shows most liability insurance policies will require you to purchase another specific kind of insurance policy, that is very expensive, to cover your venue if underage drinking (aka sale of alcohol to a minor) occurs and the venue is held liable. A lot of smaller venues and establishments that are primarily bars can't afford it or just don't care about that demographic as much. \u000a\u000aSource: I book shows.
p1322
aVmetal shows tend to be at venues that double as night clubs I think that's more likely the reason for the age restrictions
p1323
aVCould be in larger cities. I'm in a smaller one so the clubs here would never sell out a Deathcore Band. Hell, even BDM didn't sell out in a small place. I've been to a rave that didn't have an age restriction at a club and been to metal shows that did in a hall.

aV/thread
p1334
aVI *love* telling people that my favorite band's names, and showing them what they sound like. It's always hilarious when people say things like 'but you seem so normal', or 'I just don't get how anyone likes the screaming.' \u000a\u000aBut aside from petty reasons such as that, I love the vibe of the music. The heaviness, the complexity, the various cultural music styles they incorporate, the low screams, the high screams; it also has a sound that is just so different, I can't help but not like it. Also, there are no whiny vocals like there are in metalcore.\u000a\u000aBut yeah, incredible stuff. The only thing these bands need to work on are their lyrics. They can get a bit cheesy sometimes. 
p1335
aVThe "heaviness" of it. Can't really explain it. Plus that it sounds so unique compared to allot of other genres, makes it really interesting. 
p1336
aVThat element of it that makes you frown and unintentionally make an angry face. 
p1337
aVOr when your favorite song comes on, and you try and sing along with it. Growls and screeching. Feels so exhilarating.
p1338
aVWhen a breakdown is about to happen and people don't understand why you start shooshing them and look like you're about to shit yourself. 
p1339
aVHonestly it's the emotion that draws me in. The anger, the hatred, the sadness. 
p1340
aVAnger? Hatred? Sadness? more like Badassness
p1341
aVThe surprised look of people's faces when they ask what I was listening to on my old school mp3 player, and the shock of the name of the bands I listened to (As Blood Runs Black - Allegiance album 2008). Yeah good times.\u000a
p1342
aVFor me its the energy, everyone's standing still as the next band comes on stage then as soon as the song starts the crowd just explodes into movement and chaos. It's one of the few moments I feel truly alive.
p1343
aVThis, a thousand times this.  I live for concerts, being able to let loose and the exhilarating rush of power. 
p1344
aVWell...\u000a\u000aThe emotion, and there is also a huge appeal to me of pushing the limits. As in gutterals, fast guitar and solos, shredding drums, none of it is easy to do. I love seeing the sweat drop off of the musicians playing. The singing and dancing crowd. \u000a\u000aAll of it. And best of all...\u000a\u000aThere is no smoke and mirrors. \u000a\u000aI do prefer more technical deathcore/dm/wtfever over beatdown or sludge, though, so take that how you will. \u000a\u000aMy favorite albums of all time are probably Colors, Akeldema, Onset of Putrefaction, and The Harvest Wombs. Each album is different, bringing completely different sounds to the table, while all remaining true to themselves as musicians. \u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a
p1345
aVFallujah fuck yes!
p1346
aVWell, there are the triggered as fuck drums with some bands.
p1347
aVYeah, but triggers don't bother me. Drummer still has to keep tempo, which is where the skill is at. 
p1348
aV&gt;It has all the elements that I love of death metal - the blast beats, tremolo picking, the dark evil themes, etc... but it has brain melting breakdowns which just make it so much better than traditional death metal IMO.\u000a\u000ayou hit the nail on the head m8, also the drums are groovier, the vocalists are more versatile, theres more opportunity for melody
p1349
aVEveryone seems to be ignoring Melodic Death. Bands like Children of Bodom, Soilwork, Amon Amarth and Dark Tranquility keep plenty of melody.
p1350
aVI consider Melodeath to be a different genre, and even so, Melodeath can get very boring
p1351
aVThe very visceral emotions it causes.  How it can be as heavy and as skillful as any other subgenre, but it still keeps groove as it's focal point.   
p1352
aVWhen people see the album art, the looks on their faces.

p1355
aVSeparatist. The album is called "Closure".
p1356
aV[deleted]
p1357
aVMelody, blast beats, vocals that switch from high to low, sort of lo-fi or dirty production, and most of all the sporadic riffs. It doesn't really flow like some genres. It just hits you with riffs in a sort of one and done fashion. It's not my absolute favorite genre, but it's #2 or #3. 
p1358
aVWhat is your favorite genre?
p1359
aVMetalcore, specifically Melodic Metalcore, preferably low on chugs/breakdowns. Stuff like Haste the Day, Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall (not that familiar with these guys sadly), The Agony Scene, As I Lay Dying. Riffs + chorus stuff. The more melodeathy the better. It might become melodeath in the future if there are enough active bands doing stuff like [Suspension of Disbelief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTZrjYF84A) by Into Eternity. 
p1360
aVThe sheer brutality of the music i think. The vocals and drums are just so over the top that it creates a unique sound. Some of the riffs are nice but it's the drums and vocals that do it for me (and guitars for RoS too obviously). Plus it's funny when people ask you what music you listen and you can say all the fucked up shit (IA ...). I know most people will not even consider it music, I didn't too at first, but now it's starting to become my favorite genre. Props to youtube for suggesting me decapitation fornication which was probably my gateway to deathcore.
p1361
aVI just love the breakdowns. I can never get enough 
p1362
aVSlicing riffage, up beat fast blast beats followed by slowed down evil breakdown. It's never verse chorus verse chorus. It's controlled chaos. 
p1363
aVthe speed and aggression  amd the riffs you get from death metal which is then enhanced with a breakdown is just amazing.
p1364
aVprefer the vocals in deathcore when comparing it to death metal\u000abut I listen to everything except most power metal (three inches of blood is amazing)
p1365
aVThe beat. All metal does have a general beat, but a lot of deathcore has such a heavy and defined beat, its hard not to Bob your head to it. I listen to bits of all music, deathcore, rap, and classical is all my favorites. Something with a defined and strong beat gets my attention more than anything. Death metal and other sub genres are good to me still too, but none seem so defined by their chug-chug- chug melodies. 
p1366
aVBreakdowns :D
p1367
aVI used to hate deathcore too for the same reason, but it is my favorite subgenre of metal now, next to black metal. I still love lo production metal, and I enjoy the classics just as much. 
p1368
aVNothing.\u000a\u000aI just love it, the way it sounds, the adrenaline I feel listening to some songs, even some lyrics to some songs after I google 'em up of course.
p1369
aVThere's no singing (I think, I'm pretty old and get genres mixed up). Don't get me wrong, I'm a soul man when my wife is around, but I'm just not in to brutally heavy guitar and apocalyptic break-downs with some sort of aria talking place.  \u000aI'll admit that in this city of bros blasting vocal dance in rice shit-boxes wearing short-shorts, listening to deathcore in traffic is a guilty pleasure.

aVrough..i'll take it like a man though
p1383
aVJust practice, dude. Everyone's vocals were shit at some point. You've got better grit and tone than 50% of the established vocalists out there, it's just technique, power, and control that you lack, and those are the 3 things that make or break vocals.\u000a\u000aPractice *those* things. Don't just sit around, barking and squealing like you're trying to be brutal. Focus your technique, focus your power, *exercise* your breath control. Don't even *think* about "covering" a song until you find your sound, and deliver at least *some* evidence of technique, power, and control. And for fuck's sake, don't ever "cover" BMTH. It's not going to push you, it's just going to lull you into practicing shitty vocals.

p1567
aVthe only reason I was going to go was because of rings, now im actually excited to see ABRB! 
p1568
aVThis CD will be awesome as long as they do not kill it with **bad** cleans.  Cleans are ok, but if he sounds like a whiney Orange County bitch which is possible, then it will kill it.\u000a\u000aSeeing them with Rings of Saturn on the 24th. Could not be more stoked. If you are in SF and going, let me know. Let's get weird.

aVNever listened to these guys before, but this sounds awesome. It might be top in my top 3 Deathcore releases this year. The drum has a really nice sound to it. 
p1573
aVIf you've never listened to them before you need to check out their first album, Allegiance. It's probably my favorite album of all time. 
p1574
aVI wasn't impressed with one of their teaser songs, but this is honestly impressive. I am looking forward to this because it sounds very similar to Allegiance.
p1575
aVI love that album cover!

aVI was pleasantly surprised here. Expected shit. Got some pretty solid melodic deathcore. And they got that chunky bass reminiscent of Allegiance. Cool.

(obviously because tap dance is in the title.)\u000a\u000aI feel the vocals can't compete with the guitar tuning, unfortunately, BUT everyone loves Phil and I'm no exception. He pulled this song together. I've seen WC live, caught a drumstick, and got Phil to sign it because I'm kind of a giant fan boy. I honestly wish he would do more with a djenty sound versus his normal music. \u000a\u000aThanks for this. I will be listening to them more to see of the vocalist changes styles a bit.

aVThanks man! \u000aTo be honest, I slapped the guitar on pretty fast. I didn't really write it ahead of time, but rather winged it to go with the vocals. I went for simple, and went a little too simple haha. I'll make sure I'm on that soon
p1619
aVYour vocals are great, but I feel the guitar work and all the instruments in genral were not as good, and the transition beetween the instruments and your vocals were difficult to hear..

aVThat explains it all. By any chance, do you happen to know if their last vocalist (Chase Butler) is in any other band currently? I know that Jamie Hope is in IKTPQ, and the other members seem to be doing things unrelated to music :/, but I've been unable to find out if Chase is in a new band.

Rings of Saturn rounds out my top 5 favorite bands (although you already mentioned both of them)\u000a\u000a**edit2:** Also I read that you don't really like slam too much, but I must recommend [Abominable Putridity - The Anomalies of Artificial Origin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JYFgoaEeaQ). That album is by far the best the genre has to offer in my opinion.

aVThe only deathcore album that JFAC made was Doom and Devildriver is definitely not deathcore.
p1921
aVFuck yeah, finally I see some WBTBWB love. I only like their stuff that involved Tobius, mostly because their new vocalist ruined it for me from the moment he joined.

aVVeil of Maya. I think Elitist and Parkway Drive play in drop B but they aren't deathcore.
p1932
aVI've been learning some parkway slowly. Some of their riffs are pretty insane. I'll have to check elitist out. For some reason I've never heard veil either
p1933
aVThat last sentence made me sad :(

aVYou gotta check out veil of maya. My all time favorite and they're guitar player is one of the most talented in my opinion. 
p1935
aVWretched, The Crimson Armada, a couple Impending Doom songs, Depths of Hatred, Born of Osiris and some Chelsea Grin songs are in Drop B. Some are also in B Standard but it's not that difficult to tune another half step. Then you have the usual metalcore stuff that's in Drop C/C Standard.
p1936
aVUpvote for Wretched, although not completely Deathcore. Their songs are really fun to play

aVProvisions by August Burns Red is in drop B. It's fun to play, especially the intro. Veil of Maya songs are fun, BMTH's first album isn't that great besides the solo, a lot of the riffs are kinda boring. 
p1944
aVHe's already said that Parkway Drive is tricky for him. Veil of Maya would be really goddamn hard in that context. Born of Osiris's The New Reign was in drop B if I remember correctly. Not too crazy.\u000a\u000aOther than that, Blind Witness played in drop B.
p1945
aVYeah I'm getting there though which I'm pretty happy about, I stopped playing for 2 years and this is the most focused I've been when It comes to guitar. 
p1946

p1988
(lp1989
Vbetter than Black Crown, but not better than No Time to Bleed, The Cleansing, or anything Eddie did in All Shall Perish
p1990
aVNo disrespect to mitch at all, I think he was awesome.... But eddie has an insane range that I don't think most people can compete with, with that being said instrumentaly I feel like it's their weakest album, yet vocally their strongest. \u000aExcept for some reason eddie changed his writing and tried too hard to make the lyrics fit suicide silence instead of just being himself 
p1991
aVIt's very meh.
p1992
aVIts average...\u000a\u000aTheres really no praise to be sung about it, its just boring. Fantastic as entry level stuff through
p1993
aVEddie's screams blew me away but for how anticipated the album was it could have been a little better lyrically and somewhat instrumentally. Still enjoy it though!
p1994
aVEhhhhh\u000a\u000aIt's alright but I never listen to it.
p1995
aVSomething about the production that makes it a bit meh sounding, but i loved it, Control is one of my favourite jams of this year.
p1996
aVOnly song I sorta like is blue haze 
p1997
aVFeel the same way. People always say Eddie has this huge range but the thing about Mitch was he could do those lows and highs and then have his clean schtick. I liked that his voice was very unique and he truly showed it in No Time to Bleed, Smoke is his best album vocally, probably. He did say it was favorite song off that album. 
p1998
aVHaving never listened to them before I heard "You Can't Stop Me" (the song), I quite enjoy The Black Crown and You Can't Stop Me. By no means my favorite bands, but I can easily get groovin' to their stuff. 
p1999
aVI didn't get in to SS until after mitch died and for a while only liked Black Crown. I slowly started getting into the older stuff more, but I just can't get in to the newest one. I can't say it's bad, I just don't care much for it at all.
p2000
aVI thought The Cleansing was great and The Black Crown was okay. I never really listened to No Time to Bleed, but I really didn't like their newest album. 
p2001
aVI always thought they were meh, the new album didn't change my mind.\u000a\u000aActually the only album of theirs that I really enjoyed a lot was the black crown. I love the production, the album art, and the overall sound of it

p2018
(lp2019
VIIRC, the Despised Icon was the official "start" of deathcore.
p2020
aVI've heard that as well, but I don't think they were actually THE first deathcore band. 
p2021
aVIt's also been thrown around All Shall Perish "invented" deathcore.
p2022
aVI've heard it was early Heaven Shall Burn
p2023
aVHeaven Shall Burn is Melodic Death Metal. They were never Deathcore.
p2024
aVThey were easily one of the earliest, but with how ahead of their time they were I don't think they really had the fame when deathcore rose in popularity. They influenced all those early bands, but if you look at the their discography, The Ills of Modern Man was probably their most popular,  but they weren't they weren't the merch you saw at Hot Topic or FYE. They weren't the band myspace girls made signs for. I love them,  but the history of deathcore is complex.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI think it'd easier/interesting to see the history and influence of albums by doing some kind of ranking system for each year's top cds.

aVThis album to me was definitely a step down from their last 2 albums, but I still enjoyed it.
p2106
aVReally? I actually enjoy this album more than the previous 2 they released, wasn't that big on those... Of course my favorite is 'The Respect Issue' and 'felony'.
p2107
aVI think their first 3 releases are definitely underrated albums but reality kind of set in on Speaker Of The Dead. I think it's a lot like Call Of Duty games. The repetition of each song becomes more apparent and Frankie's lyrics are just trash talk with no intelligent resolution. However, again like COD, people like the album and they see that, so why change it?
p2108
aVEh speaker of the dead didn't really impress me tbh. There's a couple of songs but,  their first like 3 albums I loved. The latest one I can actually find myself enjoying for the most part. Then again its all opinion in the end.

Now I'm really curious if *anyone's* gotten them at all.\u000a\u000aI'm inclined to think they probably haven't even printed the vinyl, and at this rate, I guess they aren't going to. \u000a\u000aIf anyone can get ahold of any of the TD guys, I'd *really* like to see what they have to say, if they have the balls to say anything.

aVInfant Annihilator An Exhalation of Disease. The rowdy thrashy two step part in that song really helped me see a different side of their music in the rest of their songs. But that part is my favorite on the album, the part is just so filthy.
p2164
aVThere are so many wicked hardcore beats and brutal slams throughout the album that always go unnoticed the first time around. It wasn't until I started listening to a lot of slam death that I really learned to appreciate how goddamn groovy IA can be.
p2165
aVIt's really true. I remember when I first listened to it, all I heard was blast beats (which is not a bad thing), but I always need that slam groove to really annoy people on my train ride home heh
p2166
aVMine too!
p2167
aVI really wasn't big on Rings of Saturn until they released the first single from the new album. The kinda spacey-sweeping riff midway through the song completely captivated me, and now Lugal Ki En is easily in my top 5 of 2014.
p2168
aVYeah I mean Dingir isn't bad but it doesnt have the same flow that Lugal Ki En has.
p2169
aVThey just perfected their formula I think. Dingir is interesting and memorable, but not as captivating nor brutal.
p2170
aVWhitechapel's The Somatic Defilement made me love the band. I had only heard I, Dementia and while I love it now, it didn't have the power I was after at the time but The Somatic Defilement delivered for sure. There are a few other bands that this has happened to, including Architects with Borrowed Time, Sick of it All with Road Less Traveled and Aborted with The Extirpation Agenda.
p2171
aVDude it should be a crime to be introduced to anything but The Somatic Defilement as your first taste of Whitechapel. It's easily one of the most influential albums on the deathcore subgenre. 
p2172
aVI hated Attilla with a passion until I heard Payback, ever since I pretty much dig everything they ever put out.
p2173
aVBro,exactly for me too!
p2174
aVThe first song I heard by Bring Me The Horizon after Pray for Plagues... that album had its moments, I really liked Oli Sykes' scream, but they are so fucking terrible now. I almost crashed my car when I first heard "Sleepwalking" on the radio recently\u000a\u000aedit - whoops the album I'm talking about is called Count Your Blessings I just realized.
p2175
aVI like everything Bring Me The Horizon has put out ^^^^^^^even ^^^^^^^Drown
p2176
aVI just can't bring myself to like Drown. It's too boring.
p2177
aVIt lacks their character I get that, but it's a enjoyable for me for a few listens.
p2178
aVits pop music
p2179
aVI honestly grew to like their newer stuff even better even though I disliked it a lot at first.
p2180
aVRight? It's one of the few softer bands that I like now...
p2181
aVPray for plagues is definitely one of my favorite albums but the new stuff is growing on me. I think I probably like it because it's like listening to a totally different band (which is kinda sad cause old bring me was fantastic) so usually it just comes down to what I'm in the mood for.
p2182
aVYeah their new stuff isn't unlistenable, it's actually a good deal better than a lot of modern rock you'll hear on the radio these days, it's just disappointing to me that they totally abandoned being brutal.
p2183
aVI like all of their albums for very different reasons. There is a hell has to be my favorite out of all of them though. Why do you dismiss their new stuff as shit? It's a completely different style of music and can't really be compared to their older music.
p2184
aVI mean you're free to like their new stuff. I just like deathcore but hate most metalcore.
p2185
aVEach to their own I guess. I really like their new stuff though, even though I dislike a lot of metalcore too, I couldn't sit through an Of Mice &amp; Men album.
p2186
aVbut Sleepwalking is the best song they've ever put out.
p2187
aVSo I like screamed vocals, and I like clean vocals, but I'm really not a fan of the middle ground - like an Emmure talking to screaming sort of thing, or the half-scream half-sing going on for most of Sleepwalking. There was little enough of it on Pray for Plagues that I liked it, sadly for me that was the direction BTMH chose to pursue.
p2188
aVFair enough, while I do like Count Your Blessings a lot, Sempiternal is far and away my favorite of their albums.
p2189
aVDon't Ask Don't Tell from Chelsea Grin. Worst song they ever made, after that I didn't really listen to them anymore.
p2190
aVYeah man, they aren't doing it for me any more. Desolation of Eden was great, My Damnation got boring real fast for me and then the Evolve EP was just.....not good
p2191
aVBeing a big metalcore fan I enjoyed Evolve just because it seemed a little more melodic, but Desolation of Eden is by far my favorite Chelsea Grin album. Didn't think Ashes to Ashes was that great but it has its gems imo.
p2192
aVIMO My Damnation is amazing, DoE and EP were also amazing. I don't dig the rest of their music honestly...
p2193
aVCease to Exist by Suicide Silence. I mean obviously they have a new singer but I'm honestly not a fan of his vocals. Liked SS a lot before but not looking forward to any new albums now.
p2194
aVI just can't get behind Eddie's lyrics. His vocals are good, but the writing has been pretty lackluster.
p2195
aVIt's so crazy too because so much of the stuff Eddie wrote with ASP especially in their early years fit so well.
p2196
aVI agree. The new guys vocals just don't do it for me :(
p2197
aVThis. So much this.

aVThe whole album of Dingir
p2199
aVEmmure, first I thought they were OK chuggy deathcore, good if you were in the mood for it but MDMA showed me a more feelsy side, that I wish they played up more.
p2200
aVHypocrisy by Sworn In. I *really* liked *Catharsis* and *Start/End* (which is still my all-time favorite beatdown hardcore EP), but when they released Hypocrisy as the first single from The Death Card, I knew I was going to hate the album (and even after *trying* to like it, I still fucking hate it).

p2214
aVI agree wholeheartedly that the riffs and instrumentation were absolutely fantastic on this one.(Also agreed on Lugal Ki En(holy shit just holy shit on that album.))
p2215
aVYeah. It's pretty much what I want out of a Deathcore album.

p2244
aVI'm pretty stoked to see both. Lech is still with the band and he's one of my favorite drummers. I just hope they play Legends Never Die. Best breakdown IMO.
p2245
aVYeah, I'll give you that for sure. Lech is a beast live. I saw them when they released Allegiance with Animosity, The Faceless and Beheading the Martyr. It was a wicked show. Animosity through out all this like confetti type shit. Was rad.

aVI don't.  I think it's pretty spooky.

p2283
aVThey've definitely shifted from deathcore to nu-metal, I think it has to do with the whole return of nu-metal that I've seen lately with bands like King 810 and of course Slipknot making new stuff. I never thought I'd see the day though when nu-metal would be cool again.

p2338
asVInspired by the r/metalcore thread, what trends in deathcore are you getting sick of?
p2339
(lp2340
VIntroductions and filler tracks full of samples and repeating riffs.  \u000a1.  If you are doing an intro, show off some of what we're in for if you have some sick instrumental work in the album.  Make it fit into the context of the first song.  If possible, forget the intro.  I'd rather have less songs than have an intro and think there are more songs.  If they have to have an intro, put it in with the first song instead of making it a separate track.  \u000a2.  Filler tracks.  If it's going to be an instrumental.  Make it sick. Give us some killer instrumental work.  And/or if the album has a concept/theme, some how incorporate it with the rest of the album.  \u000a3.  I've noticed a few bands including clean vocals in some albums as of late(I'm looking at you As Blood Runs Black.)  I haven't witnessed them overused or used to where it's annoying.  Keeping cleans out of deathcore would be nice.  I mean it is a pretty brutal genre.  And if the song has this killer momentum and is chugging or speeding along and all of the sudden a clean section comes in, it just kills it for me.  I expect it from metalcore.  The cleans are often awesome in that because I often find sections where the cleans are soaring and epic.  Just doesn't seem to work for deathcore for these ears.  \u000a\u000aOf course I'm sure someone will have something to counter these but they are just things that I personally am not a fan of with deathcore.  All in all, it is still one of my favorite genres.  It keeps getting better.
p2341
aVI agree completely. An intro should fucking lay down the law right off the bat. So this is suffering has done it right just to name one . Filller tracks have to go. The holy guile did a rap but I wasn't digging his flow too much. At least it was content though instead of meaningless bull shit. 
p2342
aVSo This is Suffering is such a killer band.\u000a
p2343
aVAgreed on the cleans. I just got into SHOKRAN, and they fucking rip, and while I don't dislike their clean vocals, I think they would be better without them. 
p2344
aVI hate intros that are 2 minutes long and nothing but sound effects. When I'm browsing for new music, I give a song 30 seconds to capture my interest before I move on. I can't tell you how many awesome song I found that I previously passed on because of boring intros.  
p2345
aVTotally agreed.  It does get aggravating.
p2346
aVIm getting really bored of the generic af whore killing lyrics like you can write other lyrics and still be heavy
p2347
aVA lot of deathcore has poorly written lyrics, which is why Rings of Saturn and Acrania are very refreshing with the lyrics. Much better than what is considered generic, about death (even though RoS is basically death but with a different twist).
p2348
aV"Whore killing lyrics" are certainly not generic. In fact, they're nowhere near common enough imo. The term you're looking for is "poorly written", which most deathcore lyrics in general usually are.
p2349
aVI suppose i did exaggerate but i could name you off like at least 10 bands off the top of my head where lyrics about killing women are present
p2350
aVBy my count:\u000a\u000a1 Whitechapel album\u000a\u000a1 Chelsea Grin EP\u000a\u000a1 Thy Art Is Murder EP, and 1 demo\u000a\u000a1 Misericordiam album\u000a\u000a1 line in 1 AngelMaker song\u000a\u000aThe rest I can think of, which are indeed very many, are all brutal/slam death bands, grindcore and its derivatives, and even some metalcore. Misogynistic lyrics are common, but not so much in deathcore in particular. I for one adore lyrics about torturing whores and slaughtering sluts etc etc. Obviously when they're poorly written, it's terrible.\u000a\u000aBut so are all poorly written lyrics. The only time you get a free pass is if you're exceptionally Russian, exceptionally brutal, and your English is fucking terrible.
p2351
aVEhh fair enough, i can think of a few more but it would have been better to say poorly written lyrics, i guess its just me but every time i hear a song with lyrics like that it bugs me, not because im offended or anything it just seems old to me i guess 
p2352
aVIt's a lot easier to throw "whore" or "slut" on the end of a breakdown line than it is to rewrite it so it actually has impact.\u000a\u000aBut still, words like those can have a fuckton of impact if used well. The lyrics on Whitechapel's first album are surprisingly well-written and rather eloquent. The lyrics on Infinite Death aren't super intelligent or nothing but they work perfectly. There's no particular lyrical theme that intrinsically suffers because of its literal applications. Some of them do "get old" over time, but none of them become impossible to use properly.
p2353
aVso far, none, in fact, the way ive been seeing it, deathcore has been doing nothing but improving over the last 3 or 4 years, incorporating more technicality, versatility and melody, and bands seem to be really branching out and experimenting with it
p2354
aVVery true. It's really come to the forefront of musical progress in recent years, and that's amazing. Still, I see so many people complaining about stuff like piq squealing, open-note breakdowns, djent fusions, orchestral elements (don't know why the fuck anyone would hate this though), overusing sweep techniques, the recent explosion of crowdfunding campaigns amongst deathcore artists, etc.\u000a\u000aAnd if there's so much to complain about, I'd like to hear some explainations from those that do.
p2355
aVI love pig squeals.
p2356
aVMe too. All about that bree.
p2357
aV&gt;stuff like pig squealing\u000a\u000athis isnt unique to deathcore, and even if it was, its not like it runs rampant\u000a\u000a&gt;open-note breakdowns\u000a\u000aoh shut up, thats the point\u000a\u000a&gt;djent fusions\u000a\u000aKeyboards and palm mutes != Djent\u000a\u000a&gt;orchestral elements \u000a\u000apeople complain about that??????\u000a\u000a&gt;overusing sweep techniques\u000a\u000aplay Whitechapel: "it needs to be more technical"\u000a\u000aplay RoS: "This is too technical"\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/D6QR2py.jpg\u000a\u000a&gt;the recent explosion of crowdfunding campaigns amongst deathcore artists\u000a\u000a*deep sigh* SO FUCKING WHAT!?!\u000a

p2360
aVYou hit the nail on the head.

aVI hate the whole down tempo phase happening right now. Like yeah, there's a few bands who are awesome, mainly Black Tongue, but listening to a whole album sounds like just one big long breakdown. Go on blogspots and forums and all you see are "deathcore/down tempo". It annoys me. \u000a\u000aThey need to bring back the tech phase.

p2363
aVI am very much with you on the blogspots and forums. It's incredible how nearly every other release right now is a down tempo band. I think the production quality is cool on a lot of them, and they sound absolutely massive, but it's so hard to bounce to. Maybe they are making deathcore for the moon...
p2364
aVYeah there are way too many bands trying to revive beatdown and failing. Black Tongue, Villains, Traitors to some extent, A Memoria Brooded, Beyond Deviation (especially), Abbadon, and I guess you could say I Declare War are all doing a pretty phenominal job of it. But the rest all seem to blow really hard.\u000a\u000aAlthough, the tech shit kind of bothers me to. Of course you have bands like Rings of Saturn, going all out with it and it's amazing. Then you have bands like Ovid's Withering and Thy Art Is Murder, showing that "technical" doesn't actually just mean constant sweeping and scales upon scales. But a lot of bands I find don't know the difference, and end up just going up and down and up and down constantly. It's atrocious, especially when they're playing the exact same scale the entire time (looking at you, 95% of tech death).\u000a\u000aTechnical dynamics in metal are really similar to "Prog" dynamics in metal. If you do it well, it can be fucking amazing. If you fuck it up, even the slightest bit, you're completely fucked.
p2365
aVBlack Tongue and Genocide District are the only two downtempo/beatdown bands i like
p2366
aVBands who use an 8-string guitar when they simply just make open string chugs or a few rhythmic triplets. I get that they want the heavy tone, but my personal opinion is they should utilize more of the guitar instead and maybe just downtune a 7-string.
p2367
aVConducting from the Grave uses 7/8 string guitars (i forget which) but really utilize their full potential
p2368
aVAs a guitarist, I never understood this. Chugging is great, breakdowns are fun as fuck to play, but why the hell wouldn't you want to use the whole damn thing? Why the fuck would any guitarist choose to just refuse to do any soloing? Or even playing *any* leads for that matter.
p2369
aVMy roommate and I have this conversation all the time. \u000a\u000aI love my lead work, and I love learning new scales and forms, and he flat out refuses to even crack a theory book. \u000a\u000aI don't get it man. 
p2370
aVWell, I play lead, and I only know the very basics of theory. And even at that, I only know the basics of theory on piano. Theory itself really isn't necessary. It's a great tool to help a lot of people understand what they're *trying* to play. But I've never had any trouble understand what I'm *trying* to play, and my only limitation are my hands themselves. \u000a\u000aSome people, myself included though I don't mean to brag, just have an easier time creating music. Just like some people have an easier time recreating music they hear, which I cannot do. That's why I mostly play improvisational. It's easy for me, because I for whatever reason just have this ability to feel the entire fretboard whilst playing only a section of it. And I don't even know the location of any single note in the tuning I'm playing in right now. \u000a\u000aThe best way I can put it, is the first think black metal ever taught me. Notes, scales, and *especially* keys, mean absolutely nothing when it comes time to create. Create what sounds good, create what sounds terrible, and create what sounds so bad it comes all the way back around and sounds good again. That is how music is created. There are no rules.
p2371
aVAHHH. It drives me nuts to see so many strings go to so little use. Tosin Abasi and Javier Reyes know how to use 8 strings to their potential. \u000a\u000a[Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmwiZhC8uWQ)
p2372
aVI feel like I encounter more and more people that are just rude as fuck in the deathcore scene. I get that generally it's a genre used to express anger and other emotions like that, but that doesn't give you an excuse to be a prick at shows. Music is supposed to unite people. 
p2373
aVUh, repetitive breakdowns. It's good to include the occasional breakdown here and there, but don't include two "brutal" breakdowns in EVERY song
p2374
aVI agree with you, it can sometimes become pretty boring if the band focuses too much on the breakdowns. To me it feels like many bands are just writing their songs like build ups to their breakdowns, It can work for a few songs on a album. But if every song is written that way, it tends to get old fast. 
p2375
aVGlossy, over-produced albums. 
p2376
aVWhat is over-produced to you? When everything sounds clear and good (i.e. Ovid's Withering), or when the mix is too even and you hear things you shouldn't normally be hearing, like snare echo or uneven bass pressure?
p2377
aVI am not him, but I think the new BOO is overproduced: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yqWtYD8
p2378
aVI'm guessing maybe the new fallujah content. I think Chemical Cave was a little too over produced for me, the synth, the layers of guitar effects, idk. They did great with the production of most of the other songs on The Flesh Prevails, the synth added a distinct mood for the whole album, but I think it was over done. The editing was also a little messy, vocals too quiet or too loud at some point, just very little things. But I think the album was really well written. \u000a
p2379
aVI agree that the vocals on the new album were really poorly produced, but everything else was great I think. The synth kind of made the contrasting elements in the instrumentation a little abrasive at times, but other than that it worked rather well.\u000a\u000aHonestly, I really wish I could get into Fallujah, but the vocals are really boring on TFP and on The Harvest Wombs. The only thing I really like from them is Nomadic.
p2380
aVIt really doesn't have to do with the mix levels. \u000a\u000aI'll probably get down voted for this, but I really loved Burning the Masses' "Volatile Existence" when it came out in 2008 I think, and I was really excited for them to release a full length full production album.  When "Mind Control" came out it felt like they took all of their raw energy and sound and put it through the computer, resulting in a much more slick but bland production. \u000a\u000aNailgun Massacre off of Volatile Existence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_SbM4l30LE\u000a\u000aNailgun Massacre off of Mind Control:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXm8mlpQ98A\u000a\u000aThis trend has only seemed to have gotten worse.\u000aI also cannot stand the electronic drum breakdowns at the end of songs.\u000a\u000aI'm probably full of shit though I haven't kept up on deathcore to closely at all in the last few years.

aVThey don't make the album cover.\u000a\u000a
p2383
aVNot something with the genre in specific but some of the fans. From the beginning I have always HATED hardcore dancing. 
p2384
aVJust keep your distance? Don't go to hardcore shows?\u000aI don't personally do it, but I don't see why you hate it unless someone you know got hurt.
p2385
aVI do know people who have gotten hurt.
p2386
aVPersonally, if you don't absolutely despise hardcore dancing and those that do it, we can't be friends. I know a guy who had to miss Black Tongue's first performance in North America because he was standing kind of near the pit and some girl kicked him in the side of his head so hard he now has permanent inner ear damage. Her response to kicking him? Screaming "don't get in my fucking way" and pushing him, while he's holding his bleeding ear. \u000a\u000aThankfully, another (clearly more legit) punk girl damn near smacked her face clean *off* after the show.
p2387
aVStarland Ballroom, Sayreville, NJ, 2003. Norma Jean is playing. \u000a\u000aI watch a 30+ year old man, FSU member, spin kick some scrawny kid, no more than 13 years old, right in the face, breaking his jaw and knocking him unconscious. 
p2388
aVFuck that. Hardcore died in the 90's and the kids should've gone with it.
p2389
aVWhoa whoa whoa whoa. Hardcore is fucking awesome, and is far from dead. Hardcore dancing is not awesome, and should be put away, but the music is still fantastic. 
p2390
aVTrue hardcore punk is long dead, dude. The only "hardcore" bands still relevant today are fusion styles. It's all about that hardcore/deathcore/downtempo/beatdown trend going around these days. There are no hardcore bands today that are seeing any newfound success, and if you think Beartooth is gonna turn everything around, you'll be disappointed.\u000a\u000aHence why I'll just sit here in my cave, and wait for Black Flag 2.0 to find their way to the stage.
p2391

p2393
aVsome of the best modern hardcore bands, enjoy
p2394
aVAnd Rotting Out. They're tight. 
p2395
aVI personally love to dance at shows. But it's important not to dance like a fucktard while you are doing it. You are not jackie chan. If you're going to dance remember\u000a\u000a1. don't crowd bash, sorry, not cool, albeit fun\u000a2. Practicing your cirque du soleil routine is not tough. It does not look tough.\u000a3. don't be a pussy, actually get in the pit away from the sides where people are trying to watch a show, they don't want to dance with you. again, sorry.\u000a4. you are going to get hit, be aware, you're in the pit. You do not need to fight the person that hit you. They are doing what you are doing. \u000a5. arms in toward your chest. Throw some elbows. Stomp it out. If you have to throw and arm, at least you're in the middle.\u000a\u000aThere are more rules to this list, but I promise, we are not all bad people. 
p2396
aVI am a slam dancer and I follow your rules to a T. I'm not there to fuck some kid up in the pit, I'm there to express myself in a style that may look silly but when I feel the music flow through me I can't help myself to throw down.\u000a\u000aI was at a show last night and after Cruel Hand finished there set I was walking behind some kids talking about how much they love to punch and fuck kids up. The fucking nerve of those bastards. I really wanted to approach those kids and tell them that they are in there for the wrong reasons and they belong somewhere else. Just because you are in a mosh pit and bigger and older than people in there doesn't give you the authority to fuck some kids day up. Its people like them who can mosh pits and slam dancers a bad name
p2397
aVTotally agree. Glad there are more of us. I feel the same way you do. Fuck it. I am a mad guy most the time keeping it in a nice quiet shell. When I got to a show, I want to get violent WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET VIOLENT.\u000a\u000aThose kids sound horrible. Those are the "Bash approved" kids if you ask me :) Keep doing what you do man. BTW, I've noticed in SF, at least, that dancing seems to be dying in Deathcore since most deathcore bands tour with deathmetal bands and push pits are the norm. I weigh 135 so I lose by default in push pits. \u000a\u000aDo you notice this? Show recommendations you'd have if I want to go dance? 
p2398
aVWell I'm from Boston and the hardcore scene is pretty alive here so you can go to a pop punk show and probably see a small percent of deathcore kids, like myself, at these shows throwing down hard style but the brotherhood is true and there is a lot of respect. The show where I overheard the bashers was down in Florida and it gave me a homesick feeling because I know I wouldn't hear that shit in Boston. Also I'm 165 lbs and that is considered small in the genres crowd as well so I feel ya on the push pit thing.
p2399
aVI'm tired of over the top electronic sampling.\u000aI'm tired of breakdowns every fifteen seconds.
p2400
aVFor me, nothing pisses me off more than listening to a deathcore song and thinking "holy shit this is brutal". Then 30 seconds into the song, they hit you with some weak-as-fuck monotonous "growls" with absolutely no range, power, or depth to them. Or they just throw shitty hardcore vocals on it. I'm a big fan of high screams, so if you're going to do only lows, they'd better be good. Otherwise you're leaning into BDM territory, and if you're not slammin' as fuck, you'll fail at that too.\u000a\u000aDeathcore is a somewhat vocal-centric kind of music. If the rest of the band is going to commit to something brutal, the vocalist has to step his game up as well.
p2401
aVBreakdowns that last way too long. I love brutal stuff more than anyone I know, but those 40-second breakdowns with the 30 BPM bass drum and crashes is slow and boring to me. 
p2402
aVWith you on that. I hate when a band drops a sick breakdown, and just as I'm thinking the next verse is going to knock my socks off, I'm treated to another 4 bars of the same breakdown. Completely unnecessary.\u000a\u000aI also don't like when a breakdown is too short, but I feel that it can be done well.
p2403
aVHave the lyrics always been like this?   Just for shock value and nothing else?\u000a\u000aPersonally I like listening to lyrics I can sing out loud with no one looking at me like I'm some kind of psychopath. 
p2404
aV1. You shouldn't be singing along to deathcore lyrics out loud. At least not in public.\u000a\u000a2. You shouldn't be *singing* along to deathcore lyrics at all.\u000a\u000a3. A lot of lyrics in metal as a whole are written for shock value elements. While this is true, a lot of lyricists actually believe in what they write. A lot of lyrics about morbid subjects such as violence, murder, rape, necrophilia, etc. are METAPHORS for things the person writing about them is experiencing and/or feeling. For example, a deathcore band might feature a lyric about slashing some whore's throat. Ok, so what does that mean? Well, it could be a metaphor for betrayl, as the act could be vengeant in nature. The "whore" labeling could also refer to betrayl in the form of infidelity, or perhaps refer to someone who is being corrupted by material reward. Slashing their throat could indicate a desire to deal with the conflict as quickly as possible, or a nod to keeping someone silent. \u000a\u000aDon't assume that because something is morbid that the person writing it doesn't mean it. There is hidden meaning behind almost everything in the entire world, and that's what makes language an art form in the first place as well, through poetry. Also, just because someone might mean those things, literally or metaphorically, doesn't make them a psychopath. It just means they're putting their feelings and fantasies down on a page and turning it into music. It's not your place to tell them what their art has to be about. \u000a\u000aEven still, there probably are a couple of real psychopaths in deathcore. It's a form of music almost entirely based on making as inhuman of noises one can muster. We already knew all the goregrind kids were psycho, why not deathcore? Skinny jeans mean you can't be clinically insane?
p2405
aVOver producing vocals to the point that they sound like they are coming out of a can.
p2406
aVI might get some hate for this, but: \u000a\u000aI don't like Deathcore bands with positive/cheerish lyrics. I can sorta understand if a band chooses to have a more upbeat sound with more melodies and catchy choruses to it, then the positive lyrical approach might work for their sound. To me it makes more sense if the band plays Metalcore or has some sort of happier/sadder vibe to it.  \u000a\u000aBut when it comes to deathcore, I think the subject matter should be darker and more hateful to match up with the angry and sometimes rhythmical sound. \u000aI mean like, It's called DEATHcore for a reason. \u000aShure it's totally ok if a band chooses a positive direction, it's just that I usually have a hard time getting into those types of lyrics. 
p2407
aVI agree. Positive lyrics are more of a metalcore/post-hardcore staple, and even then I wish bands in those styles wouldn't constantly try to be so uplifting.
p2408
aV"whore killing" lyrics
p2409
aVThe only complaint I have is that I really don't like the djent tone so when I hear deathcore bands do it I sort of lose interest. Like the second (maybe 3rd) track on Aversion Crowns new album, really good... then bwow bwow bwow x20.
p2410
aV*The* djent tone? There are many, many different kinds of djenty tones. Some deathcore bands use a high-gain tone with a lower pitch, like Ovid's Withering or Lorna Shore, and they use it really well. Some bands use a more bass or mid-heavy tone with very flat distortion, like Delusions Of Grandeur or Aversion's Crown. Some use the straight-up thall as fuck drone thing Vildhjarta came up with.\u000a\u000aI love all of them, but I will agree that some deathcore bands use them really poorly. Especially when they kick in a djent tone for one little groove, but the rest of their tones already fit groove patterns well enough. It's really uneccessary. There's also a weird gray area between completely committing to the tone, and not using it enough, which makes the whole concept fall apart.
p2411
aVI'm sure there are differences, but as a drummer I couldn't begin to know the differences or terminology lol. All I know is if it sounds like Volumes, I'm not into it. Aversions Crown is my only example of it ruining a song, I heard it come on the other day and it made me change the track. Everything else was good, I just like the crunchy, deep, chugs way more. To each their own.
p2412
aVI don't like the djenty sound found in a lot of newer stuff\u000a\u000abut what I hate most is obnoxious  triggers.... Some examples are [anything from infant annihilator's album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCeRWaIh5Hw), [Aversion's Crown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tFYdzSB8bI), [Ovid's Withering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfoXYpR4PXI)\u000a\u000aLove the latter two bands mentioned, but IA... meh\u000a\u000a
p2413
aVIf you had said early Rings Of Saturn I'd have agreed, but I find absolutely nothing annoying about the triggers used on those bands' drums.

aVHSB is pretty unique and it's hard to put them in a specific category. Most people i know label them simple deathcore and i would say they're a mix of melodic death metal and metalcore.

asVWhy Deathcore is the best music
p2576
(lp2577
VDeathcore is best because it is the only extreme metal subgenre that successfully blends with raw emotion and melody with pure brutality.\u000a\u000aFavorites: Thy Art Is Murder, Shadow Of The Colossus,Conducting From The Grave, Ingested, and Xehanort
p2578
aV&gt; That successfully blends with raw emotion and melody with pure brutality.\u000a\u000aAbsolutely Poetic.
p2579
aVThy Art Is Murder, Whitechapel, Rings of Saturn, King Conquer, Taylor Swift, Within The Ruins, Older Suicide Silence, Oceano, 
p2580
aVYa sometimes after so much deathcore Taylor Swift usually mellows me out.
p2581
aVWell I do have Carnifex tattooed across my calf...
p2582
aVWhat if they break up?
p2583
aVIt aint about the band its about their music, they did break up after I got the tattoo and I was heartbroken but it didn't diminish the tattoo for me. The tattoo also reminds me of a time in my life when Carnifex was the only comfort I had, Scott's lyrics really resonated with me. It reminds me that I never want to feel that way again and it's a badge of honor that i made it out of there in one piece 
p2584
aVI see. Sounds like a very positive tattoo!
p2585
aVIt is! It was my first and is still my favorite :)
p2586
aVIs it painful?
p2587
aVYes of course it hurt 
p2588
aVWhen people ask "How do you listen to that shit?!" I simply explain them the power of music, it's relative to the user. I can listen the multiple deathcore bands and determine ones that I THINK are worth listening to and ones that aren't and distinguish differnts styles of influences the bands have. All in the mean time and non-deathcore listener would just say " But they all just sound the same?" To which I retort "I think all EDM and country music sounds the same, simply because I don't give them the time of day to listen to those genres" It's all about relativity and what makes you happy, and deathcore makes me happy.\u000a\u000aFavorites: Thy Art Is Murder, Black Tongue, Veil of Maya, Rings of Saturn\u000a\u000aCheers
p2589
aVya how can you listen to that crap it all sounds the same...my ass tell them to listen to some rings and watch their tits melt 
p2590
aVObviously Rings of Saturn sounds like a copy of Thy Art Is Murder. And Whitechapel is literally just the same band as Ingested.
p2591
aV[Embrace The End (best deathcore band imo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhddQRj7gdc)    \u000a[With Dead Hands Rising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDTm9cv2_Q)    \u000a[Dead To Fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOKfCLMeFLs)    \u000a[Misericordiam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoTBBr72V7I)    \u000a[Elysia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzP77_6WEes)    \u000a[I Ate Everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLM2pICv8xM)    \u000a[Winds Of Plague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTmHeoxzfN4)    \u000a[Knights Of The Abyss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ius-zdbNZt0)    \u000aIf you got into deathcore after 08 then you probably missed these great bands, I recommend you to check them out 
p2592
aVI really feel sad for all the people who weren't around for the 06-09 deathcore phase. There was so much sick shit. There silk is, but there's just so much nostalgia from those few years.
p2593
aVI think early 2000s metalcore is even better than mid 2000s deathcore, people were wearing really tight shirts and bootcut girl jeans and converse or new balance shoes (the tr00 hxc kids usually wore NBs lol) 
p2594
aVFUCKIN ELYSIA! I saw them on one of their last tours before they broke up! They played at a tiny record store like 40 minutes from my house with a bunch of local bands, and another touring band whose name I forgot. It was fucking awesome.
p2595
aVOvid's Withering, AngelMaker, Lorelei, Shadow Of The Colossus, Obliterationist, and A Night In Texas are the future of deathcore imo.
p2596
aVIm not really going to try to argue that deathcore is the best music, because that's 100% subjective\u000a\u000aIt is, however, the best music for me\u000a\u000aI love the deathcore style breakdowns more than any other genre. Fused death metal, you also get the evilness, the blast beats, the tremolo picking, etc that I love. Plus deathcore brings the screams that death metal doesn't have.\u000a\u000aFavorite bands currently: Lorna Shore, Aversions Crown, Thy Art Is Murder, Rings of Saturn 
p2597
aVIf you haven't yet, try listening to Born Of Osiris. That's what I recommend to everyone who is sort of new to the deathcore and metalcore scene. After all these years they still drop my jaw And raise the hairs on the back of my neck.

p2606
aVIt's pretty close tho, they have a lot of hardcore elements.
p2607
aVListed in no particular order.\u000aWhitechapel, Thy Art Is Murder, Fit For An Autopsy, King Conquer, Suicide Silence, All Shall Perish
p2608
aVI'm pretty new to deathcore. But after discovering humanities last breath and walking dead on Broadway I'm stoked on discovering more
p2609
aVtry Delta, theyre gonna get big soon
p2610
aVHumanity's Last Breath's last album is a one-man band record. Can't wait for Buster Odeholm to release the new tracks. He's also Vildhjatra's new drummer. 
p2611
aV[deleted]
p2612
aV&gt;What's your favorite band and why is Deathcore the best, motherfuckers?\u000a\u000aCarnifex. They're basically Slaughter of the Soul 2: This Time It's Deathcore. 
p2613
aVDeathcore is not the best. Don't get me wrong, I love some occasional deathcore. Whitechapel is one of my favorite extreme metal bands. It's just that a lot of deathcore is tasteless and predictable. It doesn't matter how "brutal" you are if your music is boring. Textbook case of this is Emmure. Heavy chunky guitar riffs and pounding drums, but it' so predictable I could tell what they were going to do 10 seconds before I even heard the rest of the song. Listen to some bands like Opeth and Gojira. They make a large amount of Deathcore bands look like children that just picked up some instruments in guitar center. There are so many more talented and technically beautiful so much raw power and emotion like Dying fetus. With so many thriving subgenres, it's so unfair to not even give them a try and to just give the assumption that deathcore is superior.\u000a\u000aTL;DR I like deathcore, but it is far form the best music.
p2614
aVDeathcore is awesome because sometimes you just want to get hit in the ears by a train of pure brutality.\u000a\u000aScar Symmetry has to be one of my favorites, but it's debatable if that's deathcore. Acacia Strain is really good too. All Shall Perish and the new Suicide Silence (same vocals) are also brutal as fuck and amazing.
p2615
aVScar symmetry is melodic death metal, with some influences of groove metal.
p2616
aVTechnically it's Progressive Power Melodic Death Metal. *adjusts glasses*\u000a\u000aBut I threw it in there because it has some of the same qualities that I like in deathcore :P
p2617
aVNah, this band is "Progressive Power Melodic Death Metal": [Crimson Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snI-FiyM7Dg).
p2618
aVSo is Scar Symmetry. I got it directly from their [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar_Symmetry). Can't they both be?

p2630
aVYour loss
p2631
aVIt took me a while to get into them, but for me part of the appeal was the over the top lyrics, it's like intense but at the same time not overly serious 
p2632
aVI'm sorry but how can you not love them for their lyrics? \u000a\u000a"The thought of your genitals makes me sick and I bet you could fit five cocks up that ass.\u000aWhy don't you just strap a mattress to your back?"\u000a\u000aVincent's lyrics are so deliciously over the top. It makes the band basically.

VBest Chelsea Grin album.
p2636
aVI want to see these guys live soon in Philadelphia.  What are their shows like live?  What songs do they play/arepopular.    
p2637
aVDefinitely go. They are good live, more so when they aren't on warped tour (I didn't enjoy their warped performance as much). As far as songs go I've never not heard them play recreant, usually they stick to the popular ones and throw in some random ones. All of them are good.  
p2638
aVtheir shows in canada have always been violent as fuck. you can go back and find videos of chelsea playing 4/20 at mavericks in ottawa, and find adam warren doing vocals for the whole desolation of eden set list because alex broke his jaw. (THEY BROKE HIS JAWWW~!) i remember one time i saw them it was in a venue maybe 3/4 the size of a football field or something. 2 pits one at the very front one at the very back, somehow there was a massive clusterfuck and they merged full of given at least 50 guys throwing down in a tight packed place. was nuts. 
p2639
aVWoah, that fucking brutal.  I have to go now.  
p2640
aVdon't get your hopes up, i stayed for half their set a few years ago, alex was constantly out of breath and sounded like daffy duck

p2643
aVsaw that tour in hamilton, best chelsea grin show hands down

aVCrewcabanger and Recreant off their first album are, imo, their most known songs. I don't know much about them though, so I can't really help with your question.

aVI toured with these guys in like 2007, and have remained friends through the years. They're all doing different stuff now, but The Breathing Process was a force to be reckoned with for a hot minute.

aVYou said you toured with them.  Were you in a band?  Or currently in one?

aVI was in a band called A Girl A Gun A Ghost. We played more hardcore than metal for sure, but they were one of the bands we did a DIY tour with, and they ended up helping us get signed to Siege Of Amida back in the Whitechapel days. It was a great experience, especially when Siege joined with Ferret. We recorded a rap album with them in their guitarists basement in Connecticut haha. They are interesting dudes.

p2680
aVActually I wouldnt even characterize that as his key trait. Yeah recently he has been doing it fast as hell but I think his lows are his key feature. I mean Somatic Defialment will always be there heaviest album and his vocals are just nuts. In Unanswered he used what god gave him, sadistic gutteral lows. 
p2681
aVBest overall performance- Jonny Davy for sure. His vocals are just straight up mean.\u000a\u000aBest Lucker Impression- Ricky Hoover\u000a\u000aEdit: Just kidding. Holy fuck, Eddie Hermida fucking killed it.

(lp2731
VThis put my Google-fu to the test here as I know it has been hard to find everything that is in this song.  After a bit of googling parts of the second quote(the woman talking about the old days.) I stumbled across a Google+ profile that had a comment with the whole transcript on Youtube.  I really like this song and felt this album was a great culmination of their sound circa-The Dead Walk and their sound that came into play around Continent and onward.  This song right here demonstrates that this band would make a fucking killer sludge/doom band.  This song alone puts me through the ringer emotionally.  Here it is:\u000a\u000aLYRICS  \u000a**Vincent**  \u000aInstead of fighting the sickness she is  \u000aYou\u2019ll become the disease  \u000aGive your life to the witch  \u000aGive your life to the witch  \u000aGive your life to the witch  \u000aGive your life to the witch    \u000a\u000a**Rust Cohle Quote**  \u000a\u201cYou look in their eyes, even in a picture, doesn't matter if they're dead or alive, you can still read 'em. You know what you see? They welcomed it... not at first, but... right there in the last instant. It's an unmistakable relief. See, cause they were afraid, and now they saw for the very first time how easy it was to just... let go. Yeah They saw, in that last nanosecond, they saw... what they were. You, yourself, this whole big drama, it was never more than a jerry rig of presumption and dumb will, and you could just let go. To finally know that you didn't have to hold on so tight. To realize that all your life, all your love, all your hate, all your memories, all your pain, it was all the same thing. It was all the same dream, a dream that you had inside a locked room, a dream about being a person. And like a lot of dreams, there's a monster at the end of it.\u201d  \u000a\u000a\u000a**Abra Bigham**  \u000a\u201cRemember the old days... How everything used to be? We used to be so happy. I miss that. I miss us. How normal it used to be. You and I used to smile so much... Look at all that water. I love the ocean because it reminds me of all the wonderful times we used to have here. The sounds and the sights, and the smell, it just makes me so happy. All of those memories and feelings help me live. The hope that maybe everything will be like they used to be gives me a reason to wake up in the morning. I don\u2019t dream anymore. I know a lot of people say that but I really don\u2019t. It\u2019s hard to dream when everything you used to dream about is a nightmare. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry. Sometimes I still cling to that memory, hoping. You always look the same while you\u2019re asleep. It\u2019s like reliving an old memory. So calm, so peaceful, almost happy. It reminds me of the old me, the one I thought I knew before all this. I\u2019m not a stranger to these feelings. Loneliness, emptiness, anger. But I thought we worked through them. I thought we defeated them, together. Instead they stand in defiance in the back of my mind slowly inching their way forward again. When\u2019s this going to stop? Tell me. Please tell me. Say you\u2019ll make it better again. I miss the way it was. The way things were. I would rather die than know that I will never relive those moments again. Because this isn\u2019t living, this isn\u2019t anything at all. I would rather die.\u201d  \u000a\u000a**Vincent**  \u000aShe pulls you deeper from the world  \u000aAs you gasp your final breathe  \u000aSay goodbye to the world  \u000aAnd face your fate that\u2019s worse than death  \u000aShe is the one you see when you close your eyes  \u000aSpreader of fear, paralyzer of lies  \u000aGasping for words, and exploding your heart.  \u000aWhere is the distance alone in the dark?  \u000a\u000aGive your life to the witch  \u000aSurrender your last breathe to the witch  \u000aGive your life to the witch  \u000aSurrender your last breathe to the witch  \u000a\u000a\u000a**Kurtz Quote from Apocalypse Now**  \u000a\u201cBut you have no right to call me a murderer. You have a right to kill me. You have a right to do that... but you have no right to judge me. It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means. Horror... Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies!\u201d  \u000a\u000a\u000a**Vincent**  \u000aFrozen to the bed and terror in my mind  \u000aShe calls out to me.   \u000aI cannot scream  \u000aI leave the world behind\u000aI cannot scream  \u000aI cannot scream  \u000aI cannot scream  \u000aI cannot scream  \u000a\u000aBury me in a nameless grave  \u000aBury me in a nameless grave  \u000aBury me in a nameless grave  \u000aBury me in a nameless grave\ufeff  \u000a\u000a\u000aThe source came from a user on Google+ by the name of Brow Dee  Here is a link to the post:  \u000a[Original post of the entire lyrics.](https://plus.google.com/114380769082925016380/posts/YvZj4vFMsHD)  \u000aEdit:  Made a couple modifications to this comment thanks to what /u/PUBES_IN_YOUR_FOOD pointed out below.

p2843
(lp2844
VFrom the bands facebook/bandcamp pages:\u000a\u000a&gt; The first AHFW album Domain (2008) was marred by series of unwanted edits and decisions by the band's label at the time, ultimately resulting in the release of an album that did not sound the way they wanted it to and causing the band to distance themselves from the album and its material. \u000a&gt; \u000a&gt; In 2010, the idea was briefly discussed of remixing and remastering the album and releasing someday down the road. The project was ultimately abandoned, but one track was remixed and has never been shown or released until now. This is an idea of what Domain could have sounded like.
p2845
aVIs it just that song or the whole album?\u000a

aVGod the vocals are way better. The weird ass effect his voice had before was just silly.
p2849

p2965
aVI agree with you. Not every band we discover becomes our favorite lol. 
p2966
aVCheck out some of their older stuff before Wormwood. For me, an avid listener since their first album, Wormwood was not that enjoyable - it was repetitive and unoriginal. \u000a\u000aTheir first album, ...And Life Is Very Long, wasn't their best by far, but "The Widowmaker" and "Cable Ready Techno Slut" deserve a listen.\u000a\u000aTheir next album, 3750, is better; I enjoy every song off that album.\u000a\u000aMoving forward again, they released my absolute favorite album of theirs, The Dead Walk. Every song is incredible and original.\u000a\u000aContinent is next and aside from the obvious changes in production value as they had become more popular and hence had a larger production budget, the album is still great.\u000a\u000aAfter this, they released their Most Heard Unheard EP, off of which I enjoyed "Terminator" and "Stat Puft."\u000a\u000aThen came Wormwood, which I wasn't too much of a fan of, and then Death Is Only Mortal, off of which I only liked Brain Death and was extremely disappointed.\u000a\u000aThey also covered "War Pigs" by Black Sabbath on the Resistance soundtrack.\u000a\u000aAll in all, for me, it goes like this: The Dead Walk &gt; 3750 &gt; Continent &gt; Most Heard Unheard EP &gt; ...And Life Is Very Long &gt; Wormwood &gt; Death Is Only Mortal.\u000a\u000aHope this helps you find some music from this band that you can enjoy!
p2967
aVI completely agree with you dude, except for me it would be The Dead Walk &gt; 3750 &gt; Continent &gt; Death Is The Only Mortal &gt; ...And Life Is Very Long &gt; Most Heard Unheard EP &gt; Wormwood.\u000a\u000aWormwood just wasn't that great to me, as soon as they switch to 8 strings it turned me off.  The songs on DITOM seemed like DL knew how to write better songs with an 8 string though so that was cool.
p2968
aVI don't know what the hype about this album is. I love The Acacia Strain but wow this album sucked. It wasn't as bad as DITOM but it was still pretty lame.
p2969
aVYou dont like the album? I actually dont like anything else by them but this album I loved
p2970

p2989
aVDang, man, this is great.  I can't wait to hear this with the vocals in.\u000a\u000aI don't know why people would say Vibrant Vibrance isn't deathcore.  Sure, it doesn't have a strict breakdown, but...  There're plenty of other common deathcore elements there.  Breakowns aren't the end-all-be-all of deathcore, or music.  Plus, it's not like it matters.  The song rocks, everything else is just trying to explain why.\u000a\u000aAlso, the cover of Lights is fan-fucking-tastic.  I would so fucking dig a deathcore/metal/whatever cover like that.
p2990
aVVocals are coming soon dude. I try not to think to much into genres, I just write what I think sounds cool, and I'm glad you enjoyed the lights cover!
p2991
aVI'm at a loss there too. I consider this to be straight up death-core.
p2992
aVThis is not deathcore to me. I suggest reposing it in r/metal, it will get more views there. Just don't use the "core" word. I really like the song. Does your band have a vocalist?
p2993
aVWe've kind of always branded ourselves as deathcore because that's how it originally started out, but I can see why you're saying that. Our other songs may be a bit "corey" if you will. We do have a vocalist and vocals will be recorded very soon actually.

sVWhat's the opinion on the new Chelsea Grin album? Especially Alex's vocals.
p3022
(lp3023
VVox are pretty great, instrumentals are fantastic thanks to Mr. Richardson.\u000a\u000aThe lyrics though. They are god-awful, full of cringe in so many ways. That's my only complaint about the album, really.
p3024
aVPretty much this. I just think they're trying to keep appealing to the younger crowd. 
p3025
aVOn the first discussion someone said he thought 2/3 of the lyrics were garbage and I think that's a good way to put it. Even when he did manage to write something decent it was still not as well as he's done. Still one of my favorite albums though. 
p3026
aVHis vox are on point. Lyrics are not. Riffs are great. But the guitars needed a little bit more punch, felt like they were a bit weak. 
p3027
aV[deleted]
p3028
aVSome songs are fucking amazing, some songs are good and some songs are complete trash.
p3029
aVI think it's their best album. It's pretty melodic, and the instruments sound a lot better than they did on Desolation of Eden. I also like Alex's vocals a whole lot more here than on Desolation of Eden as well, where they kind of sounded like a congested Donald Duck. Of the eight Deathcore albums I've listened to this year, it's number five. And it's probably top 25 out of all of the albums I've heard this year. 
p3030
aVDesolation of Eden is in my top 5 albums, I don't know why people bash on it. I think it's Alex's best.
p3031
aVIt's all preference I suppose. \u000a\u000aIt's not a bad album by any means though. I'm sure there would be someone who'd shit on me for the fact that The Unspoken King is in my top 10. 
p3032
aVI thoroughly enjoy it. I'm a pretty big Cheslea Grin fan regardless. I have enjoyed every bit of their music from their beginning all the way up to their newest album. 
p3033
aVAt first I didn't like it so much because I'm more biased towards the older style, however its my girlfriend's favorite album so after a while I really started to enjoy it.  Like many things in life, it just took some time 
p3034
aVWas alright, not much replay value for me though. 
p3035
aVEvery song is a metal anthem it feels like from me. And the lyrics are shit. I really liked evolve too,so I thought this had great potential 
p3036
aVI thought playing with fire was a cool song. Couldn't get into the rest of the album though. I always valued instrumentals over lyrics, so they didn't really bother me.
p3037
aVI like it a lot as a whole and Alex's vocals sound way better than I think anyone expected, but there are some really awful songs on here.
p3038
aVWell seeing as Don't Ask, Don't Tell (Some Bring Me The Horizon shit) is by far their most popular song I am so grateful they didn't pursue the metalcorey-sceney money grab genre that the song so subtly rode on. This album (whether or not a good one) was a step away from that and back where they shine. Some song are just plain great chelsea songs, some are alright but hard to get into, and some are just a bit weak sounding.. they don't have that signature flair. \u000aNow his vocals have improved quite a lot, but unfortunately we don't get to see that disgusting self-titled EP low vocal style that drew me into  this band originally. That being said, the vocals do hit well and pack a big punch. The sound is there and is solid. His voice has improved by a million.\u000aDo I love this album? It's alright, and It's sure as hell a chelsea album. I can't help but miss the pure simplicity of the EP (Maybe nostalgia speaking). The band as a whole sounds a fuckton better here than they ever have. My only gripe would be the occasional metalcore feel of evolve that seeps in here and there. If I could dictate their next album style I hope they can continue to steer from the metalcore scene, and improve on the powerful vocals and technical skill playing. It sounds so much better than strumming the same drop chord 20 times in a row.\u000aThey never cease to add something special in each album so whatever they do next, I'm sure It'll be brutal. Or half of it will.
p3039
aVThis is absolutely my go-to album right now. I just can't get it out of my head.  I'm a little biased though, as I'm still in the honeymoon stage with this album, but it's sofa king good I can't stand it.

aVisn't this more like metalcore+dupstep? but I agree it's pretty neat.
p3051
aVcause it sounds like shit.
p3052
aVDubstep was just a fad, they should incorporate electronic music with deathcore, not dubstep.
p3053
aVI can't say I'd like them to do *another* album with Dubstep elements, but I think this is a pretty interesting album because of the dubstep thing. \u000a\u000aAlso... Dubstep *is* electronic music- did you mean Deathcore mixed with other kinds of electronic music like trance/techno? Because that could be pretty cool too. Something like a Deathcore version of Crossfaith would be great. Not sure if I'd call dubstep a fad though, it still seems pretty popular to me.

aVI like Lorna Shore a lot and as someone who watched them grow from playing in a shitty theater with a venue the size of a 20x20ft to now going on tours and playing with bands such as Carnifex, Oceano, I Declare War and much more is such an amazing feeling. I really hope they go places cause they are such a good band and the members are really awesome and cool with the fans. I've talked to the bassist at a show and he's really cool, Tom(vocals) is really chill with the fans asking for pictures and asking questions. I wanted to get a full band autograph when I saw them like a week ago but their were too many people asking for pictures and I found amazement in watching Tom calmly deal with all the people and the hectic fans asking for merch. I really hope I do get a full band autograph cause I went Lorna Shore to be my first autograph! :) \u000a\u000a

Vheard the album... best shit I've heard in a while.  \u000a2015 starting strong, this is seriously a good album...prepare to get your mind blown.
p3071
aVIt was a great release. Never been huge on dual vocals, but these guys really do it well. The blond kid has a mitch lucker/Chelsea grin vibe going on in his highs and lows thay I really dig. There are a couple songs on the new album too where I mistake his highs and their cadence with the new Chelsea Grin album though the music itself and overall effort is better, imo. \u000a\u000aI have to say it came in a close second behind Ingested for me, but it was still really really good. Acrania, Angelmaker, and Ingested are my favorite deathcore bands right now, hands down that are on the up and up.\u000a\u000aNext stop, new music from Lorna Shore soon, hopefully.
p3072
aVTotally agree, they are my favorite at the moment too. Every other release just seems the same shit I've heard over and over.  \u000aLooking forward to Lorna Shore too, favorite vocals for me.
p3073
aVAgreed on the over and over feel of a lot of new releases. Or let downs from older bands changing direction (good for them, not good for mez). I really like the evil tone all four of those bands can have. There is a dark theme in their music or a good concept like Whitechapel's Somatic Defilement. Something that runs through the whole album. 
p3074
aV&gt;the blond kid\u000a\u000aHis name's Mike Greenwood, and if you think he's brutal now, wait until you see him live. His gutterals are flawless and his pig squeals are spine-vibrating.

I wasn't a huge fan of what they put out after - it kind of had too much of that weird thing that Frankie Palmeri does with his voice.  Then, unfortunately, they broke up.\u000a\u000aDo you know if any of their members went on to do anything cool?
p3087
aVAs far as I know, nope. During their reunion tour with Oceano in 2013 they dedicated their set as a fuck you to Frankie Palmeri though, so I guess there's some bad blood there.

p3165
aVDon't listen to these non believers!\u000a\u000aBands like: Slice the Cake, Winds of Plague, Lorelei, Ovids Withering, The HAARP Machine, even Dimmu Borgir and Fleshgod Apocalypse and The Black Dahlia Murder all use symphonic music with death metal and -core influences and might be up your alley.\u000a\u000aAlso, no cleans because I can't sing worth shit but my band [Plaguebringer](https://plaguebringercanada.bandcamp.com) also does melodic deathcore with some symphonic and classical influences too! You might like that too.

aVHonestly? Nothing. There is no other melodic deathcore with that style
p3183
aVD: Damn it. Something about them just gives me the tinglies. I've been listening to their stuff nonstop for a year or so. Even that weird single they put out was amazing.
p3184
aVThe Synthies, the Keyboarder singing, the intense emotions, the lyrics.. these guys will go far. IF they continue their own path and don't convert to any 'selling' style.\u000a\u000aMTS is fucking awesome.
p3185
aVI think it's the emotion. Their instrumentals are so heavenly, it's insane. They're like a blend of deathcore and melodic hardcore. 
p3186
aVTheir newest single is quite the opposite of awesome. The lyrics are a little ooey gooey for Deathcore, and he doesn't sing the same. It's also got none of the same atmosphere.
p3187
aVI felt exactly the same. Super disappointed in the stylistic changes, but I'll reserve judgment for the rest of the album.
p3188
aVOh, of course. they just seemed to cop out on their previous emotional state
p3189
aVIt's the Elegies of the new album.\u000aPlus I love that song, there's so many feels in there!\u000a\u000aGuess I'm a sucker for emotions and depth more than musical diversity. Oo

p3195
aVMy favorite PH band is [Fightstar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag4XZqFCJIY). I want to sex Charlie Simpson so bad.
p3196
aVI was just curious. Are you looking for symphonic-type bands?
p3197
aVI don't know! What defines symphonic?
p3198
aVA VERY similar band would be Through my Eyes - Skin Deep. \u000a
p3199
aVTry Painted in Exile. They just released their first new song in 5 years titled DM but their old stuff is very good too. They incorporate a lot of genres into their music too like Jazz and Hip-hop but are primarily deathcore with some slower more melodic parts.
p3200
aVIf you dig metalcore, check out as blood runs black.\u000a\u000aAlso, this is a stretch but try out A Night in Texas and Rings of saturn. 
p3201
aVoh god, a night in texas and rings of saturn are fucking amazing.. but I wouldn't say they are anything close to make them suffer lol.... they are fucking brutal compared to make them suffer.\u000a\u000aedit: as blood runs black is amazing too, but same thing, fucking brutal compared to make them suffer.
p3202
aVoh def not but everyone mentioned pretty much all the similar bands so i just threw out some bands i figured he would dig \u000a\u000aa night in texas is so dope and underrated it's almost criminal

p3207
aVThanks so much, I'll check them out when I'm done with classes today 
p3208
aVI can't think of many bands labelled as "Deathcore" that sound like Make Them Suffer, the combination of the brutal style with softer and more melodic parts is rather hard to match. The closest band that I can think of is the Metalcore band "Architects". Some of their heavier songs (try listening to "Follow The Water" and "Alpha Omega") have a similar sound to them, and they also combine quiet melodic parts, with great vocals and heavy breakdowns, whilst still retaining the "Metalcore" label. That's the closest that I can think of, give 'em a listen and see what you think. 
p3209
aVthey're pretty one of a kind, but the closest you'll get is Lorelei and Ovid's Withering.

p3213
(lp3214
VIf they kept churning out crazy good shit like Infinite Death? For sure.
p3215
aVMost likely yes, given that a good chunk of their success early on was because of the publicitiy Infinite Death got, but CJ is a fucking beast and the way they've progressed I think was entirely necessary for them to be the band they are today.
p3216
aVInfinite Death is still better than anything they currently have imo. \u000aI miss the old vocalist. \u000aFor one e.p. it was insane i couldnt wait for more, i messaged the band a looooong time ago why they got a new vocalist, they replied with CJ "can actually perform live so yeahh"\u000aThis was back on myspace. 
p3217
aVMaybe. Don't get me wrong, I think Infinite Death is awesome, but I kinda prefer Hate for a number of reasons.
p3218
aVbut if they kept their old vocalist and progressed to be some crazy band they might end up be similar to boris the blade (or they could of ended up staying just a small local band, I personally think they would of become huge anyway) \u000a**TL; DR - could have gone either way, CJ is killer live though**
p3219
aVI actually like CJ better, I think his voice fits better with the music. I like Infinite Death a lot but Hate is truly a better album. Everything is a lot more mature, which I don't think would've happened if CJ didn't join. 
p3220
aVThe difference of hate also was contributed by their lead guitarist leaving before it too. 
p3221
aVno way, cj brings everything to the table, from vocals to business. 
p3222
aVNope, his heart wasnt in it (I know Brenddogs)
p3223
aVCan you tell me the real reason he left the band? I've been listening to this band for years, and after he left I stopped listening to them until I heard reign of darkness. Their first album with cj wasn't the best. Hate is one of my top 5 albums now though. 
p3224
aVI think more successful imo. CJ's vocals still fit the band perfectly though.
p3225
aVI think they would have been more successful. All of infinite death was insane.
p3226
aVthen maybe vegas in ruins wouldn't have broken up

aVSpeaking of their discography, where the hell is their next album?
p3228
aVnope, still generic breakdowns.

p3393
aVAt least where I was, the crowd response for TaiM was wild. Like a bomb went off. It was so much fun, dancers and moshers alike were having a great time. Same for WtR, but since they played lower on the bill the pits weren't as hard, though they put on a flawless show.\u000a\u000aThat being said, I literally had to force myself to leave the room because I was laughing so hard towards the end of BtM's set. They were that bad. There seemed to be 10 people who came to see them in the crowd, and the only other time the audience had any response was during their frozen cover, which seemed to last eight minutes; and even then it seemed like it was mostly out of pity.\u000a\u000aI don't even know why they were playing under WtR to begin with... that just doesn't even make sense

p3430
(lp3431
VI'll take a stab at it, being that he's my favorite vocalist. \u000a\u000a\u000aFor me at least, it's the speed combined with the timing of the vocals. It's unique and very enjoyable. This in addition to the fact that I actually love his highs and pig squeals in combination with the lows. They may not be "cool" but I enjoy them. \u000a\u000aBasically all I'm saying can be summed up in [the end](http://youtu.be/wFEaVM3VLdc?t=2m55s) of one of their songs.\u000a\u000aEdit: [better example of vocal range](http://youtu.be/iymIQ0iQloA?t=5m)
p3432
aVI really love [this part](http://youtu.be/MZfL1Xu-fow?t=1m28s) he changes his sound so many times in that line it's pretty amazing.
p3433
aV&gt;Pig squeals haven't been cool since I was in middle school \u000a\u000aIt's a vocal style... it's neither cool or uncool. \u000a\u000aYou don't enjoy them, okay, move on. I'm not sure anything anyone could post would be able to sway you. 
p3434
aVI like how fast he can go, but that's about it. If you've listened to any actual Brutal Death, you won't really think his vocals are all that brutal.\u000a\u000aThat being said, Totalitarian Dystopia is my favorite album of 2014 so far.
p3435
aV&gt; Totalitarian Dystopia is my favorite album of 2014 so far.\u000a\u000aSecond being Lugal Ki En I hope?\u000a
p3436
aVTo me it just sounds goofy as all hell which fits with the madness of the music. It almost does sound like a parody but for some reason I enjoy it. Like listening to the dude from Cattle Decap snarl and spit. Or watching a torture porn film. In an art form clouded with brutality, sometimes the absurd is what stands out the most.
p3437
aVI agree. I've never understood the hype behind Luke Griffin. \u000a\u000aAlso, Black Tongue's vocalist is Alex Teyen.
p3438
aVI can't really argue against you about Acrania's vocalist, I've never been huge on vocals anyways, but I do prefer deep vocals overall. I also happened to be listening to ROS when I read your post, and I've always thought Ian's growling was fantastic.
p3439
aVHow can you say his vocals are generic and then go on to name Vincent and Alex Teyen as your favorite vocalists. I like them too but let's be honest here both vocalists you listed aren't winning any awards for their vocal range, and both have pretty generic vocals. Acrania's vocalist arguably has the most range of anyone else I can find in the genre currently, you just don't like gutterals and pig squeals (which have been around for a while and never left). If you want to listen to just lows-mid vocals go listen to the tough guy down tempo trend happening lately that will probably fade out in the next couple of years because there doesn't seem to be much variation between bands.
p3440
aVRead my post again. I'm not denying his range, I just said his gutturals and screams have no power and sounds generic. It sounds like he can't find what he likes best so it all just comes out flat and boring.

[Thy Art is Murder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vtaROWZt1U) is also around the mid-to-fast range and absolutely rips. Same with [Fit For an Autopsy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEfPPa8T8gU). [The Last Ten Seconds of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKz2qhjq3p8) on Invivo[Exvivo] would probably fit here, but they often cross the line into beatdown, so it's a hit or miss.\u000a\u000a\u000aThere's been a trend of aforementioned beatdown lately. Nice, slow, face-crunching beatdown in the vein of [Traitors](https://traitorsfl.bandcamp.com/album/the-hate-campaign), [A Memoria Brooded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpemfArrx4k), [Black Tongue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62i_6Byhf_c), newer [The Acacia Strain (on Death is the Only Mortal and Coma Witch)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7urCPXFkmE), (some will disagree with me here) [Impending Doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAwaq1GS__s), [Humanity's Last Breath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plrO8-DBKS8), and [Immoralist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ke-BOKpzZo).\u000a\u000a\u000aOn the more technical side of things you'll find [The Red Shore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsnc9ugrbw0), [The Schoenberg Automaton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udrQbohjKE8) (a personal favorite of mine), [Beneath the Massacre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUOZRcocoFI), and [Rings of Saturn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkG9Y6it-MA), the last of which you might or might not like.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you look for synths, things to look for would be [Born of Osiris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wraoECk6hss), [Make Them Suffer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKe4Z9mmyVk), [Ovid's Withering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfoXYpR4PXI), and [Xehanort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adiXlN32CnI).\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you like the sound of older deathcore you might like [Point Below Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_dsiCq3Osk), [Through the Eyes of the Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUoq1CQtT0Q), [Molotov Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDUDj4KRHDg), [Despised Icon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laXxoLGhwiw), [Martyr Defiled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkUqYD8L4Ng), and [The Red Chord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV5DRaqrMuo).\u000a\u000a\u000aPersonal root for [My Bitter End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-rEHK3sJEo).

Or look around the sub first, there's a post on the front page right now asking about bands similar to Whitechapel that has 18 comments. That would be a good place to start.\u000a\u000aMy guess is you'll enjoy stuff like Thy Art Is Murder, As Blood Runs Black, Chelsea Grin, The Acacia Strain, Oceano, Carnifex, I Declare War, Born of Osiris, Aversions Crown, AngelMaker, A Night In Texas, Lorna Shore.

aVthy art is murder, chelsea grin, and hell followed with, upon a burning body, rings of saturn, (older) emmure, lorna shore and rex are good places to start.

aVOh rad, I didn't realize they had another album coming out. 
p3466
aVSounded cool till the clean vocals ruined it
p3467
aVThe vocals really took awhile to grow on me but after I got used to them I actually really like what they add to the music. They are tough to get used to and I really didnt listen to these guys for awhile because of them. One day I just put it on and it just kinda clicked. Can't wait for these guys next release cause I really haven't stopped listening to this album since.
p3468
aVThe thing is, they clearly recorded the vocals tracked in chronological order. The vocals in their entirety get better as the album progresses.

VI'm interested in what the context for the show was. Was your school a high school or a post-secondary school? And where was the show, in the gym? Cafeteria? \u000a\u000aI'm interested because a deathcore band performing at my school would have been totally out of the question! So that sounds awesome to me.
p3476
aVit was a free show organized by the metal club here for the school festival. basically, all the clubs and circles try to raise money by selling food and stuff while the metal club put on free shows in one of the auditoriums. the metal club also had a bunch of other free cover band concerts (like trivium, pantera, maiden and stuff). fun day. \u000a\u000aedit: i should mention this is a college in kyoto, japan where i'm studying at.

aVWrong album, that's on Coma Witch

aVYes, yes it is.

aVIs this even deathcore though? Its like constant breakdowns with zero death metal elements 
p3505
aVGood point
p3506
aVHeh dont mistake my post for bashing acacia strain. Ive seen them posted a lot here so im pretty sure its acceptable. 
p3507
aVFuck whether its acceptable to be posted, you're missing the point of metal entirely. Its heavy as fuck so its fine by me.

p3512
aVOk after you pointed that out its pretty funnny
p3513
aVSo I stumbled into this subreddit by clicking random. That said I was somewhat into deathcore and the Acacia Strain in middle school and some of high school from like 2004-2008. This sounds like a totally different band than The Acacia Strain I remember and not in a good way. They sound like very other generic deathcore band out there. They used to have a really unique, thrashy, heavy, sound that took a lot of influence from hardcore. Not anymore I guess....
p3514
aVI love these guys so bias might be playing an effect here but I don't think they sound like every other band out there at all. This album in particular is more like their older stuff combined with a lot of Meshuggah influence (mostly in the ambient parts). If you liked their older stuff though you might like their brand new album Coma Witch. It goes back to their roots a bit. 
p3515
asVDelta - "Veils" (2:54)
p3516
(lp3517
VI REALLY like this.
p3518
aVSide note: That scream at 1:31 is beyond disgusting. 
p3519
aVThis song is sick! Whatever happened to the new ep they were releasing?

aVFuck yes, I've been waiting for this so long.
p3527
aVAm I the only one who thinks Ovid is slightly overrated?  
p3528
aVI love them! Is there anything you don't like about them or you just think they get too much undeserved hype?
p3529
aVMaybe. They do do a looooot of chugging from what I've heard so I can understand if that's a turn off, although I really love their lyrical themes and how they have this huge mythology about their stuff. 
p3530
asVDoes anyone know where the spoken word pieces in The Acacia Strain's Observer are from?
p3531
(lp3532
Vhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGoX1B6_2k\u000a\u000aIt's from Matthew McConaughey in this episode of True Detective. Skip to 1:45 for the actual part.
p3533
aVThanks a bunch! Did you find it by Google or are you familiar with the show and recognized it when listening? 
p3534
aVI think I googled "like a lot of dreams there's a monster at the end." 
p3535
aVHoly. Shit. \u000a\u000aI've been saying that this part of Observer sounds like "creepy Matthew McConaughey voice" since I first heard it, but I had NO idea it was actually "creepy Matthew McConaughey voice"! And I even saw this episode of True Detective (awesome freakin show) and still didn't put 2 + 2 together. Thanks for the detective work!\u000a\u000aAnd I can't get enough of this tune. I never thought me and my ridiculously short attention span could get into a nearly 28 minute long tune, but I can't stop listening. This shit is awesome!
p3536
aVIt's definitely one of my favorite parts of the album.
p3537
aVThe male voices are samples, but the liner notes in the hard copy mentioned Abra Bigham as additional personnel. I Googled her, she's a voice actor, which leads me to believe that the female spoken word section is an original recording.

aVAwesome, thank you, I love that it's an original bit, really adds something to the masterpiece.

aVAnything with Luke in is brilliant, immediately his vocals take forefront of music.  I would love to see him as rings of saturn vocalist.  That would be best combo in deathcore.

p3585
aVMetalSucks has always hated the core genres. They embody the elitist metalhead culture that would be best to always avoid.\u000a\u000aSo, with regards to this article... Not worth reading.

aVAxl is the only elitist. The other guys are quite cool.

aVI really don't care about someone's opinions about a band's fan

aVI was under the impression that Metalsucks was supposed to be a joke? They Shit on the stuff they love, and everyone takes them so seriously.

aVthis isnt an article is a poorly written exuse for being to fucking stupid to form any valid arguments

p3623
aVI think 80% of the deathcore bands I listen to, I found through your posts on threads like these.
p3624
aVits nice to know i'm appreciated, thanks mate
p3625
aVI made a thread about this a few days ago (idk if you replied to it or not) but since you seem to know a lot of deathcore, do you know any bands that use a ton of tremolo picking? stuff like ABRBs allegiance ... with blood comes cleansing... etc \u000a\u000a
p3626
aVOvdi!!
p3627
aVThanks a ton, man!!! I absolutely love Conducting From the Grave's self titled album!
p3628
aVYou should be a mod the...O.
p3629
aVRings Of Saturns new album
p3630
aVAcrania, Thy Art is murder, Whitechapel, Oceano, The acacia strain, Black tongue, Suicide silence, I declare war, infant annihilator, make them suffer, the last ten seconds of life, and hell followed with, rose funeral, or emmure.     \u000a\u000aThose are what I would consider my staple bands probably. All different little niches of metal but a grander focus on what this subreddit tends to like and what is easy to get into.\u000a\u000aYou said you wanted some aspects of deathcore, most people will tell you chugging and breakdowns and they aren't wrong. It gets a lot of flak for being easy to play and people say it's easy but in reality creating anything as crushing as the band's I've listed above takes a ton of skill and the more you listen the better you appreciate how simple music can still break your bones
p3631
aVI remember the first time I listened through Wormwood by TAS I thought, "pfft, lame" and then I gave it another once through at a friend's behest, and *really listened* to the music itself, and despite that albums flaws, I can honestly say it's probably one of my favorites in the genre. How angry the vocalist sounds, and how sincerely he seems to hate everything, plus those riffs just gets me. \u000a\u000aThat got a little out of hand and long winded, but my point is, I guess, I like your list, and recommend that album by them in particular. It seems like I have an easier time hearing the details(?) rather than just a bunch of dissonant noise and incomprehensible words, like so many deathcore bands are prone too. 
p3632
aVThanks for your detail, I'll check those bands out!
p3633
aV/u/keepitcutthroat will probably be more help than I, but as someone who likes similar stuff when it comes to Metalcore you could try Carnifex. Especially their second album, [The Diseased and the Poisoned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHTAj8wirsM). If you like that you could try their first album, and As Blood Runs Black's first album Allegiance. You might give Knights of the Abyss' second album [Shades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32JGiq-Rz6I) a try too. Of course Job for a Cowboy's ep [Doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jhi88tjS7A). \u000a\u000aIf you just want to dive right into it you could try Thy Art is Muder's ep [Infinite Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxqzNbcj1d8)
p3634
aVThanks for the links! I'll check them out!
p3635
aVthe red chord. Doom by Job For a Cowboy. The Cleansing by Suicide Silence. Lorna Shore. The Acacia Strain.
p3636
aVThanks for the suggestion!
p3637
aVDefinitely agree with the red chord. I have been obsessing over them lately. \u000a\u000aThey are a good mix of deathcore and metalcore. Pretty techy shit too. 
p3638
aVTechnically they're mathcore, but they perfect for bridging the gap
p3639
aVTomato tomato
p3640
aVStart with All Shall Perish !!!
p3641
aVWhich album? I'm a huge ASP fan and I know which album I'd have someone start with. 
p3642
aVWhich album would that be?
p3643
aVI don't think I've ever met another person who agrees with me, but in my opinion, Awaken the Dreamers is probably the closest to a perfect album I've ever heard. There's not a single part of any song on there I was would change. 
p3644
aVFor me, the best album is the price of existence. Really brotal but really melodic too.\u000aI love others albums too (btw, do not forget the first album ;))
p3645
aVThat's the one I hear most commonly. The only one I can say anything really negative about is This is Where it Ends. That was a weak record. 
p3646
aVagree
p3647
aV[Whitechapel is a must](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o9tj-xH1qU)
p3648
aVmaybe 5 years ago..
p3649
aVHence why I linked Possession 
p3650
aVPeople consider current Whitechapel not deathcore? \u000a\u000aAnd people are linking Chelsea grin as deathcore? Woah. 
p3651
aVBecause Chelsea grin is clearly deathcore? 
p3652
aVLol no they aren't. They are sell outs 
p3653
aVExcept they're deathcore
p3654
aVStill makes them deathcore though right? 
p3655
aVApparently being deathcore has a political stigma that you must be underground to still be deathcore /s
p3656
aVI think you would like In Dying Arms
p3657
aVI'll take a look, thanks!
p3658
aVAllegiance by As Blood Runs Black, that was the first deathcore album I ever listened to, still one of my favorites.
p3659
aVAwesome! Thanks for the comment I'll be checking them out too!
p3660
aVI would definitely recommend The Acacia Strain, and of course Whitechapel (if you haven't heard them already ha). Phil Bozeman is easily one of the best in the genre. 
p3661
aVI wish he'd quit layering his vocals so heavily. I can barely understand about 1/3 of Our Endless War, and it's not like I'm new to the style
p3662
aVin dying arms \u000a\u000athey can mix the br00tal vocals with more melodic cleans to make it a bit different
p3663
aVThanks, I've seen a few posts about In Dying Arms, I'll be sure to check them out!
p3664
aVI like Carnifex's Die Without Hope a lot but I got into deathcore through Suicide Silence. I feel SS is a major gateway band for deathcore so they are safe to try out. You Only Live Once's lyrics are kinda eh but it is really catchy and that got me into deathcore. I like Chelsea Grin and Whitechapel as well.
p3665
aVThanks for the suggestions, I'll defiantly take a look!
p3666
aVI'm surprised that no one has mentioned carnifex their most recent album die without hope was amazing and is a must listen to
p3667
aVThanks, it'll be on my to-listen-to-list!
p3668
aVNp! Its really cool cause they take a lot of influence from black metal so it has that feel plus the deathcore stuff
p3669
aVAenimus, Depths of Hatred, Rose Funeral, Within the Ruins, Lorelei, Aversion's Crown, Ovid's Withering, Slice the Cake, Veil of Maya, Humanity's Last Breath..... deathcore is alright. technical death metal is where its at
p3670
aVUpvote for Slice the Cake. Fucking hell yeah bro. 
p3671
aVhuge fan of them. they kill it
p3672
aVNew Chelsea Grin is amazing as are Born of Osiris two most recent albums 
p3673
aVOld Chelsea Grin*
p3674
aVIdk i think theyre newest album is totally different from everything else theyve done and about a hundred times better. 
p3675
aVAgreed
p3676
aVAnd I'll take a look *back* at them too! Thanks!
p3677
aVI'll be sure to listen to them, thanks for you suggestion!
p3678
aVIf you're looking for something to ease you in, definitely go with [Betraying The Martyrs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ykuf11YkmHo). They have cleans, and mix a sort of post-hardcore/metalcore sound with some of the heavier aspects of deathcore. Born Of Osiris is probably another good one as they aren't particularly super heavy. From there maybe check out Thy Art Is Murder, Make Them Suffer, Aversions Crown (all aussies) and maybe Suicide Silence, Chelsea Grin, Carnifex or Whitechapel. These are some of the more popular deathcore bands and arent hard to get into
p3679
aVHard to say what's friendly to start with because we're all different! I can only provide one of my favorite bands, [Impending Doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPAA-OJdh3Y). Death will reign! Please let me know what you think.
p3680
aVYou should start where a lot of people did with some of the older stuff. \u000a\u000aJob for a cowboy-Doom\u000a\u000aDespised Icon-The ills of modern man or the healing process (or any of them, I love these guys) \u000a\u000aWhitechapel-somatic defilement or this is exile\u000a\u000aAs blood runs black-allegiance \u000a\u000aSuicide silence-the cleansing\u000a\u000aThrough the eyes of the dead-bloodlust or malice both are great \u000a\u000aAnd as always \u000a\u000aInfant annihilator is a must \u000a\u000aThen go from there it just keeps getting better,\u000a\u000aEdit:spelling

aVThanks for sharing some more stuff with me\u2026 I'll defiantly check these out too when I have some free time.
p3682
aVmarked for reference &lt;3
p3683
aVCheck out We Are The End too, they were signed to Metal Blade for a short time.  Their demos are good, but if you can find the shit that they got signed for like Dear Diary, When Children Become Sidewalks, and The Cost of Catching Your Breath then definitely listen to those.  To me it's like god tier.

aVWhy Brandon why
p3703
aVThat sounds awful. Slam with Brandon's vocals, no thanks.\u000a\u000aSuper talented lyricist, but unless he has some hidden brutality I've never heard, he would fit a different style so much better.
p3704
aVYeah that song was extremely boring, but I really don't expect their new music to sound like that, hopefully. I'm just excited to hear Brandon's sweet buttery voice again.
p3705
aVI'm excited tbh. Their two songs on SoundCloud sound good. &lt;3
p3706
aVThat doesnt sound like a good combo, vocalist will have to change or the IDW members will have to change. Their music with his vocals wont go well.

aVIt's the genre I listen to most, but not the only one I listen to, that would be weird. I like most other genres of metal, plus a little classical and some electronic stuff (breakcore, dubstep etc.)

aVNot at all. I spend most of my time rating stuff, I don't even remember half of the stuff I listen to though. I keep track of it through [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/Amethyst_Star/tracks?page=1) and [rateyourmusic](https://rateyourmusic.com/~amethyststar) though.

p3742
aVJustin Timberlake is a fucking legend.
p3743
aVDeath/metalcore, some prog, post-rock, EDM and "chillstep" are most of what I listen to.
p3744
aVDeathcore is the current go to poison.  But metalcore, hardcore, classical, grindcore, crust, powerviolence, alternative, ambient, metal(various forms of extreme and traditional) and rock are all my favorites.  Depends on whatever I feel like listening to at any given time.
p3745
aVDeathcore, metalcore, 90's alternative. Good stuff here and there. 
p3746
aVmost kinda of metal, hardcore, pop punk, punk, classic rock....shit really everything but modern country and 99% of electronic music

aVDeathcore and prog-djent-shit are the only things I listen to. \u000a\u000aAcacia Strain, The Contortionist, Rings of Saturn, Tesseract, Skyharbor. Shit like that. 
p3748
aVI listen to just about everything. I jam to Billy Joel just as often as I jam to circle of dead children.

aVI feel the exact same way you do. Check out With Blood Comes Cleansing. They have two albums. Sadly, they are not making new music anymore to my knowledge, but their two albums sounds like satan walking into a catholic church to sacrifice a virgin with angels around the ceilings and demons around the alter.... yeah, like that. \u000a\u000a- [With Blood Comes Cleansing - Horror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPD7FI5C5gs).\u000a- [With Blood Comes Cleansing - Golgotha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ7BawjhthE).\u000a\u000aIf I think of any others, I'll let you know. 
p3781
aVwow, that is **EXACTLY** what I was looking for. I fucking love it. \u000a\u000aedit: I don't know if this is true or not, but it seems like this is more common in a lot of 'older' deathcore albums (like pre-09ish). Everything is so djenty these days. 
p3782
aVI feel like that is an accurate statement from what I've found looking for that type of feeling. Check out [The Blood Countess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-kBH6KR2AM) too. This song not as much, but the whole album has that vibe. Couldn't find the full album on youtube right now. They have a very With Blood Comes Cleansing type vibe. \u000a\u000aAnother good band you might like that does this is [Resist the Thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hodh_Le7V2k). This song is almost solely tremolo picking for the full intro and first verse. Listen to this full CD and you'll find what you are looking for too. \u000a\u000aIf you are into music in general, listen to Daniel Barenboim play Chopin's Noturnes. It is all piano, but it is very dark, morose, and melancholy. He was a romantic composer so if you like this general type of sound, check out all romantic composer and some baroque composers really do a good job of capturing that vibe too. \u000a\u000aEDIT. As much as I love Zetterberg, Datsyuk has such mad style. Go Ducks though in the end!

p3840
aVI'm in the same town as them/friends with them, and have seen them a few times in the past few months. Their past few shows, they played a new intro (fucking ballsy and super slammy) and a new song (heavy as fuck). Expect this new album to be AOTY.
p3841
aVI hope so. I've already got two albums that ive been looking forward to for a looooooong time. Ingested's new album and the one Sylosis is about to release. 
p3842
aVI heard a lot of Midi files when I was hanging out with them. They made like 30 tracks, and put them down to like, 10-13 or something like that, taking all the best parts from all of them. And expect samples. they wanted to bring back samples in deathcore bands like in the old days. Itll be fucking tight. Im so stoked on it.

VFound this band in my suggestions in Spotify.  Wow.  This is some seriously killer, shreddy, brutal stuff right here.  The melodic guitar work on it is just so fantastic.  Couple that with some brutal breakdowns, this makes for a very killer listen.  It sounds like it culls a lot from As Blood Runs Black's Allegiance, and All Shall Perish's The Price of Existence(which makes sense as both albums came up 3 years before.).  Definitely not bad.  
p3924

asVYoung folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?
p3993
(lp3994
Vmy dad always listened to rock in the car and I really liked metallica, korn, staind, disturbed, etc. when I was little and when I was in highschool my buddy had the devil wears prada on his ipod and let me listen to it.(swords dragons and diet coke..still remember) thought it was weird at first but then hearing the breakdowns I fukin loved it. Started listening to bands like them, then gravitated to more "brutal" stuff, found Rose Funeral and Carnifex and thats what really got me in the genre. \u000a\u000aNow I'm more into death metal, really love the old school bands like Baphomet, Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, etc. 
p3995
aVVery similar for me, my dad always listened to pantera, metallica, rob zombie, etc so I just kinda naturally gravitated to stuff like that. the first CD I ever bought was Toxicity by System of a Down and I loved it. Listened to linkin park and loved their screamed vocals and started finding things with more and more screaming until finding metalcore/deathcore, stuff like that.
p3996
aVIs your dad now interested in your stuff? In our family van we always listened to music my brother and I wanted to hear. So my mom had to endure some Cannibal Corpse while riding to the mountains.
p3997
aVSort of, but not as much as I'd like. I showed him August Burns Red's new christmas song ([it's so cool haha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH9f3CacSjI#t=30)) and he lol'd when the vocals came in, but he definitely wouldn't listen on his own. closest he's gotten is probably avenged sevenfold, he really likes them. But yeah, my family has had to listen to a lot that I'm sure they hated.
p3998
aVHaha, this song *is* funny! Nice breakdown though.\u000a\u000aI suggest you expose him to a lot growls and screams till he starts to like it, similarly like we "grew" into our music taste ;-)
p3999
aVHaha, awesome! Brings back some memories, too! I can totally relate to the "gravitating towards more brutal stuff": Often I found myself looking for something even more extreme (I guess I stopped at Crepitation [http://youtu.be/d6cd8uhFe7E])\u000aI like how you're looking for the roots of your bands, like Cannibal Corpse and Suffocation. Long time favorites of mine, too. Then i discovered the new stuff which arrived from the USA. So just the other way around than you.
p4000
aVGrew up to bands like 311, Modest Mouse, Falling Up, etc. \u000aIn middle school, I played guitar guitar hero and heard songs like Six, Prequel to the Sequel, and that always appealed to me for some reason. \u000a\u000aPretty self explanatory from there, started researching, going to shows, socializing with other metalheads, etc. 
p4001
aVI never thought about the Guitar Hero part of your story!
p4002
aVI'm really into System of a Down. Slipknot used to be the more "hardcore" stuff for me. \u000aI've discovered Carnifex by messing around on Youtube at the beginning of the year when they release [Dragged into the Grave.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1hafyakGXE) The ending part was a blast, so well written. \u000a\u000aDie Without Hope is my albums of the year, actually, one of my favorite album ever. I've listened to all Carnifex album, but unfortunately, none sounds like their newest (don't get me wrong, some of their oldest sounds are outstanding, Dead But Dreaming, Hell Chose me, Hope Dies With The Decadent), but none of them sounds as good as Die Without Hope in my opinion. 
p4003
aVCarnifex seems to be a way more important band that I thought it to be.
p4004
aVCarnifex was the reason i started writing songs and wanting to be a vocalist. That never happened (yet) but it was the one band that i connected to the most when listening /reading thier lyrics (emotional love stuff) so they will always be one of my favorite bands.
p4005

p4006
aVCarry on with your aim to be a vocalist, man! Get yourself a little setup and a small room to practice, and later some nice dudes to play great music with. My brother practiced for almost 2 years but set it aside after he lost interest because it got boring to just scream for himself. I still think it's a shame he never sang in a band.
p4007
aVI guess I did what most kids do these days. I was introduced to a pop-metalcore-ish band through a runescape friend (yes, it was those days) and I started listening to it because I liked it a lot. I listened to metalcore for many years, and got to know of Chelsea Grin, Suicide Silence and Whitechapel through youtube comments and videos. Started listening to it, and I never looked back! Now 6 years later, deathcore is the genre of music I listen to the most, but my taste has grown into more of the underground bands who incorporate a lot of brutal death metal and slam elements into their music, opposed to for example, ironically enough: Chelsea Grin, Suicide Silence and Whitechapel who took their music in a more commercial direction.
p4008
aVIt's funny how Youtube was, and maybe still is, a platform for many young bands.\u000a\u000aCould you maybe name a few bands you're listening to at the moment? It sounds like something I would enjoy, too.\u000a
p4009
aVBeen listening to a lot of Acrania, Vulvodynia, Beyond Deviation (some of the nastiest high's in deathcore I tell ye), Cage of Torment (norway represent) and some I Declare War (yes, they have some slam stuff in some of their songs). Those are what I remember from the top of my head.
p4010
aVHeavy stuff! Seems like you went from pop-ish stuff to quiet extreme stuff. I conclude that younger people still start with lighter metal stuff and try to experience new sounds by going to extremer sounds and vocals.\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed Cage of Torment. And Acrania seems to have havesome lyrics. Thanks for the suggestions!
p4011
aVWhen I was younger one day I got bored of green day after they released a bad album. Prior to that I literally ONLY listened to green day.\u000a\u000aA friend recommended me slipknot, and linked the music video to sulfur. I really liked it so listened to skipknot and other nu metal bands for a while (such as SoaD). Also listened to some disturbed. I thought I was such a metal head and that I listened to really heavy shit. \u000a\u000aA few months later I decided to listen to some of the metal classics, such as iron maiden. After listening to some older stuff like that for a while, I discovered power metal. I listened to straight power metal for at least a year, I loved it way more than slipknot/SoaD/disturbed. After a while power metal started getting a bit old but I still loved it.\u000a\u000aAt the time, I was a huge league of legends fan, and one day when I was browsing the league forums I stumbled upon a thread asking what song you are currently listened to. I clicked a random link and stumbled upon [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oqPrB7NPdo). This is what started my journey into extreme metal.\u000a\u000aI torrented the album and listened to it for a while. It was the only album with that "crazy screaming/growling shit" that I actually enjoyed. I kind of hovered between this album and power metal for a while... I was actually ashamed that I was listening to stuff with screaming haha... I thought "i don't want to be one of *those* people" (whatever that means).\u000a\u000aEventually I got over that phase and realized that I really did enjoy the vocals on this album. I tried to learn more about this type of music - it was a mix of electronic stuff and something called "metalcore". I did more research on metalcore and eventually started listening to more of it. I grew very tolerant of harsh vocals after a while, and eventually I realized I liked it better than cleans.\u000a\u000aI eventually stumbled upon deathcore, death metal, and all the other extreme metal genres. \u000a\u000aAnd here I am today.. ive given up metalcore. Mostly listen to deathcore and slam death metal. I had phases of black metal/death metal, but I find that I like deathcore/slam the most.\u000a\u000a
p4012
aV&gt; I grew very tolerant of harsh vocals after a while, and eventually I realized I liked it better than cleans.\u000a\u000aHaha, this never gets old I guess! Thank you for telling your journey, I liked reading it.
p4013
aVI don't know if I count as younger (21) but I found the genre because of rateyourmusic. I saw the genre was related to metalcore and looked at [the list of all of the deathcore albums](https://rateyourmusic.com/customchart?page=1&amp;chart_type=top&amp;type=album&amp;year=alltime&amp;genre_include=1&amp;genres=Deathcore&amp;include_child_genres=t&amp;include=both&amp;limit=none&amp;countries=) just looking at all the different album art, and liked the one for [Dominion](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/one_more_victim/dominion/) by One More Victim and decided to check it out. Before that I'd known about deathcore, but really didn't want to listen to any of it because I wasn't interested in metal  (and the pig squeals were a huge turn off). I ended up liking the album and came here to ask for some suggestions, burned through those in a couple of weeks and got tired of deathcore. A little while later though I heard that Carnifex had a new album out and said "fuck it why not get into Carnifex?" and decided to marathon their discography. I actually really liked it.\u000a\u000aI'm still not as familiar with the genre as I'd like to be though.  
p4014
aVWhat led you to listening Metalcore? (I am assuming you were/are listening to Metalcore because you mentioned this connection on rateyourmusic.) What were you listening before "Extreme Music"?\u000a\u000aAnd how do you differentiate between Metalcore and Metal (you said that you were not interested in Metal). Where do you draw the line? Are you interested in the big bands of "classic" metal or not at all?
p4015
aV&gt;What led you to listening Metalcore?\u000a\u000aThere's a show I watch that has a fairly large fan base, enough so that it has it's own little music "scene" and a couple of online radio stations. One of the songs I heard on the station was some energetic guitar work with a mix of clean + harsh vocals. I was also watching a youtuber called theneedledrop around the same time, and he put out a video reviewing Sempiternal by Bring Me the Horizon, I like the one fan song a lot and said "both of these are metalcore right?" and checked out the genre. \u000a\u000a&gt;What were you listening before "Extreme Music"?\u000a\u000aFan music of a show I watch, psychedelic trance (Infected Mushroom, Astral Projection, 1200 Micrograms, Shpongle, Hallucinogen, the Distance to Goa compilations), brostep (Skrillex, Excision, Knife Party, Bassnectar), and the occasional hip hop album (Run the Jewels, Lost in Space/Black Elvis, Dr. Octagon, Operation Doomsday, Czarface, Critical Beatdown, A Piece of Strange). I did have a few token metal albums I was listening to, Come My Fanatics by Electric Wizard, Meir and the s/t by Kvelertak, White 1 by Sunn O))), and pretty much everything Machinae Supremacy put out. \u000a\u000a &gt;And how do you differentiate between Metalcore and Metal\u000a\u000aI'm not wholly sure on that. Honestly I just think of metalcore as melodeath with choruses and the occasional breakdown or chug. \u000a\u000a&gt;Where do you draw the line?\u000a\u000aI really don't at this point. I've pretty much gotten over my whole metal"phobia" for the most part. \u000a\u000a&gt;Are you interested in the big bands of "classic" metal or not at all?\u000a\u000aI'm interested in getting into as many genres as I can at the moment. So at some point, if by classic you're talking about like Iron Maiden (I've listened to them twice) and other 70's/80's bands. But not right now. I'm trying to get into death metal right now, especially melodic death metal, especially a small backlog of stuff from this year that I need to get through in the next couple of weeks. But at some point absolutely. 
p4016
aVThis was very interesting to read, thank you! I quickly listened to Machinae Supremacy and found a link I was looking for in my post: I never heard this kind of music before (although it sometimes remembers me of Dragonforce) and I guess it may bridge the gap between more popular genres and things like Deathcore. A bridge I never heard before.\u000a\u000aI once was at the point as you are right now: I was really interested in the roots of "my music" and tried all the old bands, reaching back to Black Sabbath. But I think it isn't condemnable if one doesn't like everything from the past, just because it influenced your favorite band. I never got into Iron Maiden, for example. Or Judas Priest.\u000a\u000aI tried hard to find a suggestion, which will slowly bring you into Death Metal. Try Dying Fetus. Although Dying Fetus is fast and brutal, they often have somehow groovy parts, to which you may will connect. Try their cover album "History repeats" for easy access ;-)
p4017

But it's not just metal genres that I'm interested in. \u000a\u000a&gt; But I think it isn't condemnable if one doesn't like everything from the past, just because it influenced your favorite band. \u000a\u000aCertainly. I haven't been a fan of what little beatdown hardcore I've heard. No one can expect to like everything out there. \u000a\u000a&gt;I tried hard to find a suggestion, which will slowly bring you into Death Metal. Try Dying Fetus. Although Dying Fetus is fast and brutal, they often have somehow groovy parts, to which you may will connect.\u000a\u000aMy problem at this point isn't that I can't handle dm, I just have to explore it more. But I have a huge ass backlog of music to burn through (like ~700 albums) I don't have much time for it. I tend to listen to an album and then forget about it, but I'm keeping with the metal I like [here](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/amethyststar/favorite_albums__metal/). \u000a\u000a&gt;Try Dying Fetus. Although Dying Fetus is fast and brutal, they often have somehow groovy parts, to which you may will connect. Try their cover album "History repeats" for easy access ;-)\u000a\u000aI'll give the album a listen sometime. I liked the Dying Fetus album I listened to a while ago. \u000a
p4018
aVWell back in the day 10 years ago when I was like 12-13ish I listened to a decent amount of "rock" mostly pop-rock like Sum 41, Good Charlotte, Jimmy Eat World etc. I heard bands like Metallica, Guns n Roses, Megadeth etc. on the radio and liked them, but then my best friend showed me Underoath and I wanted more bands like that so I went on blanktv when it was a music video site and discovered mainly; Children of Bodom, Atreyu, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Haste the Day and Killswitch Engage. \u000a\u000aNeedless to say when I started high school all my new friends I made listened to pretty much the same stuff and introduced me to a lot of new bands/genres. Although metalcore remained at the top, because of AILD, ATR, and HTD. My first ever concert was those 3 with Through the Eyes of the Dead! ;D Anyways since I was always looking for new bands to listen to this sounds kinda lame but around 2007-08 I look up "best breakdown" videos on youtube, and that's where I first heard Whitechapel - Vicer Exciser, Carnifex -Lie to My Face, Suicide Silence - No Pity For a Coward etc. And ever since been a huge deathcore fan.
p4019
aV21 now, When I was around 14 I heard Whitechapel's This is Exile and instantly got hooked. Before that it was mostly Metallica, Slayer, etc.. i got into Death Metal after listening to Deathcore oddly enough.
p4020
aVSo just the other way around than me :-)
p4021
aVI'm 18, and in seventh grade I started listening to Flyleaf, which turned to BMTH's EP (I never liked anything else by them), then the first true deathcore I listened to was Chelsea Grin's Evolve EP a few years later. People hate on that but if it weren't for the cleans in Lilith and DADT, I probably wouldn't have grown to like deathcore today. My second deathcore band after CG ended up being Rings of Saturn, which I'm pretty proud about.
p4022
aVDamn, I just listened to Rings of Saturn (Dingir). I personally hear some Mathcore influences. Not easy to listen to.
p4023
aVbest breakdown videos on youtube to find new bands in maybe 07?\u000ai was into rap then i liked limp bizkit then went onto like wrestling type nu metal bands then one of my friends took me too a taste of chaos show and i got into mosh hardcore. Around this time i just wanted to check out heaps of bands as i just got a ipod and need to fill it plus I liked the sound. By the time 2008 started i was into deathcore. 
p4024
aVThis sounds like the kind of journey I was imagining for myself. Starting with Rap, going to New Metal stuff, advancing to Hardcore and searching for other styles with breakdowns. This path "wasn't" possible or this popular when I was younger. Thank you!
p4025
aVIt's kinda hard to tell where exactly I found my way into deathcore. I've always been into rock and almost all types of metal and have always been looking for new bands to listen to. One day I was looking at some old The Black Dahlia Murder music on YouTube and saw Bring Me The Horizon in the recommended video list. I started listening to them and enjoyed it for a while, but nothing past their first album really seemed to compare. So once again I went back to YouTube and started checking out more recommended videos. Eventually I found something I really liked, the music video for Servants of Divinity by Bleed From Within. After that I wanted more music like this, so I did the unthinkable, I started reading YouTube comments and saw people recommending other bands, Thy Art is Murder's Infinite Death and As Blood Runs Black Allegiance were the most notable bands, I still listen to that ep/album every week. From that point I started listening to mostly deathcore and I mainly discover bands now from this subreddit,   different tours, and even YouTube recommended videos sometimes.  
p4026
aV&gt; I started reading YouTube comments and saw people recommending other bands\u000a\u000aHaha! :-D\u000a\u000aI discovered As blood Runs Black through Youtube, too. Amazing how it got some bands really popular!
p4027
aVI suppose 18 is young (college freshman)...\u000a\u000aI find myself to be pretty similar with the others. About 5th grade was when I actually discovered Green Day from a friend; which encouraged me to learn guitar. At that point, I was familiarized with all the classic rock bands because my dad always had rock on the radio and he jammed my iPod with 30 GB of it.\u000a\u000aAs I got better with guitar, I discovered AC/DC, and then learned all of their songs. I would even consider Metallica or Megadeth being really "heavy" then. I pretty much listened purely to AC/DC until about 8th grade when I really listened to Megadeth, Pantera, and the other classic metal bands. Also because my skill with guitar had progressed to this point as well. At some point I also became obsessed with Tool. I can accredit many of the bands I know to Pandora. \u000a\u000aAround 11th grade some random video had a part of a Gojira song in it. Then I fell in love with Gojira. Pandora introduced me to Meshuggah and I thought that was (still do) some brilliant shit. Looking back I would've thought this was the heaviest stuff out there in middle school.\u000a\u000aFunny thing I was looking for a song called "Carrion" written for the new Call of Duty zombie mode and accidentally clicked on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhbyS1SuR7c]("Carrion" by Parkway Drive). It was a really weird sound to me, but I actually couldn't believe that I didn't find the vocal styles unbearable. That's what led me to a few good bands in metalcore with the help of Pandora.\u000a\u000aSomewhere I found Thy Art Is Murder and have been heavily focused on listening to Deathcore for the past year and a half or so.\u000a\u000aThrough the years, I can see my musical tastes changing and my interpretation of what is "heavy" kept getting pushed back by something better.
p4028
aVAwesome story, thanks for sharing! It seems like although you are a little bit younger you still took the same music path like a lot of my friends did: Getting obsessed with AC/DC and then looking for other great musicians in bands like Pantera and Tool.
p4029
aVGrowing up, I never liked any music, mainly because my dad only listened to rap and my mom only listened to country and I couldn't get into those. When I was about ten, my friend gave me a mixtape for my birthday with bands like Linkin Park, Three Days Grace, and Papa Roach. I later discovered pop punk bands like Blink, Sum, and The Offspring. I gradually got into post-hardcore and metalcore and then, Mitch Lucker passed away and everyone was talking about it, and I discovered Suicide Silence, getting me into more deathcore bands 
p4030
aVI used to listen to Japanese bands like Dir En Grey, Maximum the Hormone, and even Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. I wanted to find English bands like the first two, so I found Asking Alexandria (Not close at all, but I used to like them). One night I was reading through YouTube comments one some AA music video, and I saw a comment about Acrania being better. I thought nobody could be better than AA, so I checked Acrania out. I then started liking deathcore. 
p4031
aVIt all started in my junior high scene kid days, the classics like The Used, From Autumn To Ashes, Fall of Troy. Went to high school and kind of stopped listening to heavy music till my sophomore year heard Black Dahlia Murder and was instantly sucked back into heavy music, got really into death metal then heard whitechapel and slowly became tolerant of the breakdowns and gutterals. now I listen to mostly deathcore or hardcore.
p4032
aVI went to my older cousins house few years ago and heard 'Bat Country' by Avenged Sevenfold because he was playing Guitar Hero. I looked them up at home, liked them and started listening to bands like SOAD, BVB and Slipknot.  \u000a  \u000aWhen I started buying music magazines it exposed me to different kinds of rock and metal and I slowly shifted from hard rock and popular metal to heavier stuff, but almost nothing with harsh vox still. A comment on an A7X video led me to DevilDriver (still love 'em!) and I really liked the song 'Clouds Over California'. From there, I began exploring groove metal, melodeath and death metal.  \u000a\u000aThen I found deathcore a couple of years ago and fell in love with it. It helps that I made a friend on the deviantART forums who recommended me a lot of good stuff.
p4033
aVI'm probably one of the younger people on this sub. \u000a\u000aI started with indie, still love indie (indie pop, indie rock, electronica). \u000a\u000aThen I heard Linkin Park (I know, I know) and that was the heaviest music I had heard, and I loved it. Then my friend in middle school introduced me to BMTH and I hated it because screaming. \u000a\u000aBut I started listening to it more and more (listened to There Is A Hell like 50 times) and got hooked on AA and Of Mice and Men. \u000a\u000a\u000aFrom there I started listening to Count Your Blessings (BMTH has become one of my favorite bands) and then I was sold, and started listening to Emmure, Deafheaven, AGATG, and then I went down the rabbit hole thanks to you guys.\u000a\u000a\u000a**TL;DR:** Austin Carlile saved my ~~life~~ music taste
p4034
aVMy mother listend to GnR,Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Bon Jovi,Aerosmith and that kind of music. But at one point that started to be too soft i can say. I listned to some of asking alexandria and bullet for my valentine and some Slayer on the side. Later on I heard about Lamb of God and with Lamb, there was Pantera. But I was still wanting something stronger so my friend told me about Suicide Silence,Whitechappel and Thy Art is Murder. That's how i got hooked on deathcore. And I'm 15 btw\u000a
p4035
aVAwesome! Thank you.
p4036
aVI started listening to bands like rise against, and harder rock like A7X. Led me to metalcore, and eventually here. Now I listen to deathcore exclusively. 
p4037
aVVery interesting, thank you for your reply. So younger folks of today still still start with bands like Rise Against? How have you heard of them the first time?
p4038
aVPandora. I started hearing some heavier bands. Like the newer asking alexandria. Then I started listening to the older stuff by them and thinking wow, I like the music but this screaming stuff sucks. I used to love cleans, and hate screams.. Now I hate cleans, and love screams. I eased my way into it.
p4039
aVYeah, it takes some time to getting used to the vocals, but once you're there you don't go back all too fast. My younger brother listened to Dimmu Borgir before me and it took me 3 months until I started liking the screams I heard through the walls.
p4040
asVFavorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)
p4041
(lp4042
VComa Witch by far. I like what they did with the production and its just so. fucking. heavy. The ending breakdown for Send Help is just all kinds of nasty.
p4043
aVFuck yes. I love the Acacia Strain because they are just ball to the fuckin walls heavy as shit. Nothing fancy just hate
p4044
aVExactly. Same with bands like Black Tongue. I hate reading YouTube comments about how "this band is terrible. All it is is just one long breakdown." Well no shit. Black tongue and The Acacia Strain were created with the sole purpose of being heavy as fuck. 
p4045
aVRings of Saturn tends to get a lot of hate but personally I think it's gonna be REALLY hard to hate on Lugal Ki En. It's a masterpiece:^) new Acacia Strain is good but it just can't hold my attention the same way yknow
p4046
aVThey do get a lot of hate. I wouldn't say I hated them per se, but definitely did not listen to them prior to this. Knew about them, thought Embryonic Anomaly was sick, but still didn't listen to them often. More of a friend who doesn't listen to metal type shocker band. After hearing this, I was able to listen to their whole discography and appreciate it in a completely new light. 
p4047
aVIf you asked me 1 month ago how I felt about RoS I would have said they're awful. But After listening to all their songs they are easily my favorite band at the moment. It's definitely different than what I usually listen to, but I love that shit.
p4048
aVSolid thread OP, I was aware of all but the Sever the King release (I've never heard of them before actually). I'm really digging the new RoS, but I'm giving Sever the King's album a listen and its sick.
p4049
aVI found out about the release last night. It was awesome. It reminded me of a toned down version of these guys \u2014 [Colossus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b91QFlURaKY). 
p4050
aVI'm gonna have to go with Lugal Ki En. It's beautiful.
p4051
aVLugal Ki En is pretty excellent, but I've been listening to Coma Witch continuously for roughly 72 hours haha
p4052
aVPersonally, it was between TAS and ROS. I am giving a slight edge to The Acacia Strain because it held my attention a little better than Lugal Ki En.
p4053
aVHow did it hold your attention better? I only ask because most people (I would assume) would argue that ROS' release had so much going on it held you listening to where TAS would be less melodic let's say and therefore more straight forward. Interested to hear what you think. Do you also like down tempo primarily in Deathcore? 
p4054
aVIt just did, it's hard to explain but I feel that Coma Witch was more complete than Lugal Ki En (not to say it was a bad album at all, it is a really good album) but on the whole, I prefer TAS to ROS. I love down tempo in Deathcore but I don't know if I would say I primarily like down tempo, I love faster stuff too.
p4055
aVLugal Ki En was my introduction to Rings of Saturn, and I'm a fan now. I gotta go with that!

aVIt's bullshit. There should be some sort of recourse for the fans through indiegogo to get their money back

Or at least save the music bashing for a review. \u000a\u000aNow, hopefully this isn't true. 
p4081
aVThey are harsh on a lot of metalcore, so I'm not really surprised on the music bashing. I do however know of some people that did the pre-order stuff from indiegogo and haven't gotten their download yet. I would be pissed too, because I didn't order it and here I am listening to it on spotify for free... lol
p4082
aVYeah. I'm not surprised that they hate -core. A lot of people seem to. \u000a\u000aI might not buy the album if that's really true, that's terrible. You make a promise, you fucking keep it. 
p4083
aVI might be a bit in the wrong, but indiegogo is very much alike kickstarted right? Did they actually get the money, since from that article it stated they did not reach the target goal. On kickstarted it would mean it is a no go project. If the project would still get financed by the indiegogo campaign that way it sucks, but I think these guys have had a hard time lately so I wouldn't personally make a big deal out of it.
p4084
aVI'm not sure honestly. \u000a\u000aI know on kickstarter there's flexible payment, where you still get the money even if you don't reach the goal. But I don't know anything about indiegogo.\u000a\u000aIt's still shitty regardless though. Maybe it's me, but I think if you make a promise to the fans you either:\u000a\u000aa) Keep it, even if it means taking a financial hit\u000a\u000aor \u000a\u000ab) refund them, even if it means taking a financial hit\u000a\u000aYou shouldn't make a promise you can't keep. 
p4085
aVHmm, I am not really sure about that kickstarter/indiegogo issue either so I can't judge that correctly. Of course you should try to keep your promises, but you can promise things now because it looks like an easy promise to keep. Maybe they just can't afford to take this financial hit. I understand the frustration about it but I would just give it some time to let the band sort this out. 
p4086
aVIf they can't do it now, they should do it later.\u000a\u000a
p4087
aVPretty sure it doesn't matter if you reach your goal. \u000aIve given money to a few bands that started a campaign and didn't reach their goal. I still got my digital download and t-shirt. I think the money goes straight to the band regardless. Obviously there are fees involved but it's so minimal. There really isn't any reason for a digital download to not be able to be e-mailed out to their fans.

p4096
aVJob For a Cowboy and By Blood and Iron.\u000a\u000aI listen to a lot of metalcore too and I started to want more heavy and less cleans so I progressed to deathcore and was not dissappointed
p4097
aVAs Blood Runs Black. Allegience.\u000a\u000aThis is the album that made me transcend into this awesome genre. Its still one of my top 3 favorite albums ever. My top 3 (in no specific order) being ABRB - Allegience, Lorna Shore - Maleficium, Thirteen Bled Promises - Heliopause Fleets.
p4098
aVImpending Doom - Nailed. Dead. Risen.\u000a
p4099
aVIn the Midst of Lions (R.I.P.)got me started on deathcore. When I saw them live. They were from St. Louis and we're amazing. Then I went to carnifex, whitechapel, As Blood Runs Black, etc. \u000a\u000aI like death core better because I love the rhythm in music more than anything and death metal is just to constricted and feels robotic. "We're a deathmetal band and to compete we have to have the most INTENSE solos, most black clothes, most long hair for headbanging..." and so on. Death core is way more casual. Also, I probably like core more because it's the catchiest. Not that death metal is bad, but I really like a good breakdown and the screams are entirely different. \u000a\u000aWhy do so many people like suicide silence? I just can't get into it. 
p4100
aVI saw In The Midst of Lions right before they broke up. They were awesome. It was actually on the last Thrash and Burn Tour back in 2011! Great show. Carnifex is another one of my favorite deathcore bands. I haven't really been able to follow As Blood Runs Black past their album Allegiance. Just not all that crazy about them. \u000a\u000aI definitely know what you mean about the dynamic rhythmic feel that deathcore has as opposed to death metal. I usually prefer something that tends to change a bit through the song. Death metal definitely does feel constricted. But there are plenty of times that that's what I'm in the mood for. Sometimes all I want to listen to is Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, or Dying Fetus. So for me I think it all has to do with my mood.\u000a\u000aI don't know what it is about Suicide Silence. I've always loved them since I first got into deathcore. I fell in love with The Cleansing when I first heard it. I think a part of my love for them has to do with when I saw them at the 2011 Mayhem Fest. Mitch Lucker's dynamic stage presence really got me (R.I.P.) 
p4101
aVDifferent strokes for different folks. I completely understand the craving for a specific sound. Maybe you could recommend me a song and I'll try it. \u000a\u000aToday is music day, haha.

p4103
aVAre you from stl? I've seen them live a couple times, shit was brutal.
p4104
aVNo, I'm in Arkansas and they're amazing as shit. The venue when I first saw the was called the village. The two guitarist hopped on the bar and the rest were on the stage and they two stepped in time. All while throwing down. Shit was great. 
p4105
aVextreme metal Arkansas here, band that got me into deathcore is a local band here called Abandon The Artifice!
p4106
aVStill one of my favorite deathcore bands
p4107
aVSame bands got me into deathcore as well. I just got into heavier music as I got older and scouted for bands. Death metal and deathcore are probably equal for me. I like me some WhiteChapel, Born of Osiris and Ingested but sometimes I want Job for a Cowboy, Death, Nile or Gojira.
p4108
aVBorn of Osiris are pretty damn awesome. In regards to death metal, Death is definitely my favorite. Leprosy and Spiritual Healing are such great albums. Gojira is pretty great, but I never really followed them that much. And you can never go wrong with Nile. 
p4109
aVI just find it interesting that JFAC used to be on the other side of that list.
p4110
aVJFAC and TAIM first albums, chelsea grin and whitechapel as well. Came from metalcore originally, merged through All Shall Perish.
p4111
aVWinds of Plague and Knights of the Abyss. Discovered both on MySpace and couldn't get enough.
p4112
aVMolotov Solution, specifically tier song The Final Hour. So good
p4113
aVChelsea Grin really. Really wasn't in to it at first, then my friend wanted me to learn a few songs from CG and one from BOO on bass and I was pretty hooked on it. Raw intensity and simplicity go well together, especially while playing. I now listen to Danza (if you'd call that deathcore) and Rings of Saturn almost exclusively, with a little bit of CG and Carnifex in the mix.\u000a\u000aIt widened my mind on music and really humbled me on the subject of "technical is always better". Used to hate CG and the like because all i heard were open notes and bends. Now love it
p4114
aVSuicide Silence - The Cleansing \u000a\u000aChelsea Grin - Self titled EP\u000a\u000aJob For a Cowboy - Doom EP\u000a\u000aBring Me the Horizon - Count Your Blessings \u000a\u000aafter that i started listening to as blood runs black, oceano, whitechapel, ect.
p4115
aVSuicide silence, job for a cowboy, oceano, heaven shall burn and make them suffer
p4116
aVElysia and molotov solution \u000a\u000aand all the others such as jfac, and impending doom.  SS played a big part also, \u000a\u000athe biggest memory which finally turned me that was a good bridge of hardcore and death influences was animosity empires....still one of my fav albums to date.
p4117
aVSuicide Silence obviously. The Price of Beauty and Unanswered are great tracks. Chelsea Smile by BMTH also helped, but that's not really deathcore.\u000a\u000a\u000aI love Death Metal, specially stuff like Decapitated, Dying Fetus, Behemoth or Cattle Decapitation. But at the end of the day i still prefer deathcore over death metal because of its catchiness and breakdowns.
p4118
aVWhitechapel - To All That Are Dead (that exact song got me into deathcore)\u000a\u000aI just liked how it sounded, it had a lot of power in it compared to the other shit I listened to. I don't have any preference between deathcore or death metal.
p4119
aVI'm gonna be a generic scene kid here and say Suicide Silence. It was Slaves To Substance that really caught my attention 
p4120
aVThe Red Cord - Fused Together in Revolving Doors was the first me --&gt; Then Through the Eyes of the Dead - The Scars of Ages --&gt; The Taste of Blood - Predator --&gt; From there it just got heavier and heavier.  \u000a\u000aI started off as big thrash/death metal fan(still am) but back then when these genres were first mixing it was blowing my mind  at how heavy these bands doing this could be.
p4121
aVBoris The Blade basically they won me over after I saw them live in 2013.
p4122
aVWhitechapel and Born of Osiris. I originally was a big post hardcore / generic metal core fan, then whilst browsing YouTube a video for Whitechapel's The saw is the law appeared (yeah not been a fan of the genre for too long) and I liked it. Soon after that o found BoO and had no idea them and Whitechapel were the same style of metal
p4123
aVBy watching backyard wrestling videos produced by the guitarist of Boris the Blade in around 2003-2006. He just used to throw melodic death metal and like nu metal tracks over their fights and i guess as he got into more heavier stuff he incorporated that in their videos and I was hooked on what I watching and the music. 
p4124
aVSuicide Silence definitely. I picked up their self-titled EP years ago and it's as amazing now as it was then.
p4125
aV[deleted]
p4126
aVBring me the horizon - Count your bessings\u000aIt is kinda embarassing to say this, but at the time it disclosed a brand new world. Some songs still kick-ass (like Off the heezay)
p4127
aVBMTH is one of those bands that everyone loves to hate. I even jumped on that bandwagon myself a while back. For a while I really couldn't get into them. Then it wasn't until about two or three years ago I listened to them again and was like "Wow, they're actually not THAT bad." They're a pretty good band in my opinion. 
p4128
aVBring Me the Horizon - Count Your Blessings\u000a\u000aSuicide Silence - The Cleansing\u000a\u000aWhitechapel - This is Exile\u000a\u000aChelsea Grin - Self Titled\u000a\u000aDefinitely prefer deathcore over death metal, just like how it sounds.

VAmazing. Not as perfect as 10 Code was, but they still did a great job. 
p4294
aVI got it through bandcamp and I have an iPhone, anyway, this is my personal AOTY it is so much better then 10 code imo, the vocals are perfect.
p4295
aVI'm honestly surprised reading these comments; I liked 10 Code, but I think this is screechy water trash compared to their old material. 
p4296
aVAOTY for me no doubt. It's scary how much the lyrics directly relate to my current state of life. It's like they took them out of my mental journal. \u000a\u000aAfter my first listen, I had to pause just to think about it before replaying it again. 
p4297
aVThis is how I feel, too. Though I'm not sure if it's my AOTY. *Loom* by Frameworks, *Home, Like NoPlace Is There* by The Hotelier, and the Full of Hell x Merzbow collab are all very tight.

aVI just looked it up and apparently artists get $0.10 a song. I'm sure it's less if they're going through a label but I don't know how that all works. \u000a\u000aSo... not much lol. I mean it adds up but you have to sell a shit load of songs to get any real amount of money.
p4307
aVwell i know bands dont make much either off CD's. idk im too lazy to search up all this information to find out. oh well. thanks for this!
p4308
aVWhy are they not on iTunes?!?
p4309
aVMan, I wish these guys would just get their original vocalist back, or stop getting whiny manchildren to do vocals for them. Their original vocalist had so much power, and sounded so fucking pissed, and the guy on 10 Code, and their drummer, both sound like whiny fifteen year olds.
p4310
aVIt's not on iTunes because they recorded the whole album independently, good move honestly as they get more money for the purchases.

You guys are classics.

aVHaha, as someone who likes the album, I couldn't agree more about it sounding compressed.

aVIt lacked substance in my opinion, on paper the album is technical and aggressive, but there was little atmosphere and they lost any feel to the music because they were too focused on wankery
p4547
aVThe atmosphere was kind of wasted in the first two songs on the record. After that they just kinda recycled the low end and like you said, wanked.

aVLugal Ki En was a great album, musically they took it to the next level.  Although what Luke Griffin from Acrania is doing with his vocals is well worth a mention.\u000a\u000aIs there any way to go back and see winners from past years?
p4549
aVweve only done this once before and it was informal

(lp4569
VOh Carnifex. Expect to bang your head and have a good time.. But you probably need to watch our for hardcore dancing idiots, unfortunately.
p4570
aVMy thoughts exactly. I'm going with my SO and my friend and would rather not have any of us hit. The only concert I have been too, within the ruins, I saw two girls punched in the face by those guys. Would rather that not happen. \u000a\u000aEdit: forgot to mention carnifex is pretty much what got me into deathcore, he'll chose me was and is an amazing song. Do you have any idea what their current line up may be?
p4571
aVDo not stand on the edge of the pit. Keep your SO in arms length. Enough for you to put a fist out if needed so that person hits your fist before your SO. Also, if shit starts getting crazy around you, push her behind you where the crazy is not happening and start moshing like a mad man. This will cause everyone around you to stop and give you space, thus saving your SO and yourself. But main rule, if you don't want to get bumped or hit, stay away from the edge of the pit. 
p4572
aVI feel like I've gotten hurt so many more times on the edge of the pit rather than actually being in the pit.
p4573
aVThat's reassuring   :\u005c
p4574
aVHave faith, I think he means physically standing on the edge where you are essentially the human shield between the pit and the people standing on the edge. This is probably the worst place to stand at any given time especially if kids are crowd bashing / really getting into that circle pit. You'll be good have faith. \u000a
p4575
aVHaha thanks, I'm not really worried about myself though. I can take pain, just rather not have my SO get clocked. But yeah we'lol definitely stay a little ways away from the pit
p4576
aVJust keep her behind you. Or in front of you if you plan on being close to the stage.
p4577
aVThere's tons of places to stand at a show. Stand at the back. 
p4578
aVThanks for the advice, I'm definitely gonna mosh a bit but that's not her scene. Thankfully my friend will be there so we can take turns in the pit
p4579
aVThey play hatred and slaughter, hell chose me, slit wrist savior towards the end, a lot of the new album. They are so great live. 
p4580
aVThanks man! I'm getting so psyched up waiting for this. I can't wait to hear these guys! 
p4581
aVExact same way I got into it! Hell chose me is still my favorite song \u005cm/
p4582
aVWorcester native here. If you end up on the floor where the pit is, be careful. Worcester goes hard. I'll be there, it will be an absolute banger of a show!
p4583
aVWooh! How hard we talking? Like broken bones or bloody noses? My brother had his jaw broken at an emmure concert (4+ years ago) and I'd rather avoid shit like that 
p4584
aVPeople get thrown out for fighting a lot. It depends on the crowd. Just be aware of what is happening around you!
p4585
aVThe Palladium has an area right above the floor that's great for shows when you don't want to be in the pit. You're still close enough to the stage to see eveything, but no worrying about some dude's elbow clocking you in the face. It's my go-to for shows there.
p4586
aVSweet thanks for the advice! That's probably where we'll be then. Do they have a bar there or do I have to pre-game?
p4587
aVThere's a bar a little ways behind that. But you'd definitely need someone to hold your spot, or else somebody will take it as soon as you move.
p4588
aVI'm going with two other people so that won't be a problem, thanks for your help!
p4589
aVSaw black tongue in Tampa last year. And it was really awesome, during beat down everyone went slow mo in the pit.

p4591
aVChelsea Grin AND Carnifex? Jesus fuck I wish I was going. 
p4592
aVI'm probably going to it. You'll be fine dude, it might get a little rough in the pit but if you don't want that just stay out of it. The Palladium is a great place for a first show.

p4620
aVGoogle Play Music All Access, or whatever they're calling it these days.

aVI stream what I can (spotify usually), download what I can't, and buy what I end up really liking at some point. If I buy I try to buy physicals. In my ~8 months of listening to deathcore I've acquired maybe 12 - 15 cd's of it. My most recent being Lugal Ki En. 
p4623
aV&gt;Lugal Ki En. \u000a\u000aGood choice. \u000a

aVhonestly just youtube and r/deathcore\u000a\u000aima have to start using bandcamp apparently. Ive purchased some albums from there but I haven't really used it as a place to find new music
p4628
aV[GetMetal](http://getmetal.org/), [Realm of Metal](http://v1.realmofmetal.org), The Pirate Bay, or googling "&lt;band name&gt; &lt;album name&gt; rar download"
p4629
aVDon't assume that I legally download my music. Don't assume that I illegally download my music. Let's just not assume anything about how I got my music.
p4630
aV* Search blog sites and youtube channels like chugcore, duckcore, pigsquealsandbreakdowns, yourdailybreakdowns, beheadingthetraitor, totaldeathcore, spirit-of-metal, record labels I like, and of course  /r/Deathcore  to preview music, read reviews, get an idea of what's currently hot.\u000a\u000a* If it strikes my interests I will search for a free download via blog sites or torrents. \u000a\u000a* If the album is good I'll buy a physical CD or shirt from the band. \u000a\u000a* If it's REALLY good I buy the vinyl (if available of course)\u000a\u000a

That was until I hear the interlude where they got all "let's pray together now."\u000a\u000aI know most deathcore is usually pretty morbid and brutal but this was just such a crazy juxtaposition I couldn't even continue listening. Same thing with Impending Doom although I can't really understand the lyrics so it's not as much of a problem!

p4739
aVFrom the wikipedias.\u000a\u000a&gt;Acrania is a rare congenital disorder that occurs in the human fetus in which the flat bones in the cranial vault are either completely or partially absent. The cerebral hemispheres develop completely but abnormally. The condition is frequently, though not always, associated with anencephaly. The fetus is said to suffer from acrania if it meets the following criteria: the fetus should have a perfectly normal facial bone, a normal cervical column but without the fetal skull and a volume of brain tissue equivalent to at least one third of the normal brain size.

p4814
aVThat was quite good.
p4815
aVDamn. I've never listened to these guys before, I might have to fix that now. \u000a\u000aThe drum sound is great. 
p4816
aVTheir first 2 albums are great. Incisions had a somewhat poor production quality and its kind of experimental, so not a whole lot of people like it. But depths and contagion are fantastic.
p4817
aVWhen you say Incisions had "poor production quality" what do you mean by poor? Like it's actually bad? Or is it lo fi or something? 
p4818
aVOne thing I loved about the first two was the power behind the bass drum and guitar. It was loud, and awesome. Incisions? It sounds like someone turned down the bass down completely. It sounds off. I liked incisions, but it always bothered me. 
p4819
aVI just listened to a track from Incisions (Incisions) and one from Depths (District of Misery). I think the production on Incisions was better actually, but i can hear what you're saying about the drum. It does have more power on Depths. \u000a\u000aThe closer it sounds to Carnifex's [first album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVOsc0hEES0) or The Agony Scene's [second album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1wDLVJDFUk) the better imo.

aV**AOTY?!**\u000a\u000aBeen anxiously awaiting this release all year, I think it's definitely in the conversation for Album Of The Year after first listen. I don't think there are any other huge releases coming up for the rest of 2014 so we can start to reflect.\u000a\u000aBased on popularity in this sub I'd say the winner has to be between Aversion's Crown, Rings Of Saturn, and Acrania.\u000a\u000aIn my opinion the decision is a lot tougher as I really liked Sever The King, Seditionist, Boris The Blade, I Declare War, Black Tongue, and Depths Of Hatred's releases this year too.\u000a\u000aWhat are your top 3 from 2014? And if there are still upcoming releases I'm forgetting please remind me. 
p4879
aVAs far as straight up deathcore is concerned I would say that Rings of Saturn has definitely got the album of the year for me. \u000a\u000aWith that said, and although not really deathcore, Job for a cowboy's newest album destroys everything that has been released this year (in the death metal category). Some of the best prog death I've ever heard. 
p4880
aVJFAC's album is sick indeed but there are plenty of death metal albums released this year that would compete with it. Check out both Origin's and Fallujah's full lengths that came out this year.
p4881
aVI haven't heard origins album but I've listened to fallujahs several times. I was a huge fan of their first album and EP, and when I heard the first single for their newest album it blew me away, but the whole album wasn't as consistently good for me. I think the ambiance was a little too high in the mix but eh different strokes for different folks lol

asVDoes anyone else miss old deathcore?
p4900
(lp4901
VNot really, most of my favourite albums are from 2006-10 but right now we have bands like Angelmaker, A Night In Texas, Slice The Cake, Ingested, Ovid's Withering, Shadow of the Colossus, Nexilva, Martyr Defiled, I, Valiance, Aversions Crown, Lorna Shore putting out better quality music than any of the old guard did, deathcore at the moment is by far the most diverse core genre and it's only getting better.
p4902
aVI hated deathcore until around 2010 (excluding Infinite Death, The Somatic Defilement, and Fused Together In Revolving Doors). It was boring, chuggy and lacked versatility.
p4903
aVyeah I miss old deathcore. ABRB's album Allegiance will forever be my favorite deathcore album. I do like a lot of newer stuff though. I didn't like 2010-2012 deathcore. I felt like the 2010-2012 stuff was where deathcore started trying to diversify but most of it was all prototypical and mediocre.. now we're experiencing the fruits of that movement though. \u000a\u000aIt has become an extremely diverse genre recently. When stuff like Within The Ruins, Ovid's Withering, Rings of Saturn, and Thy Art Is Murder all fall under the same overarching genre you know it has grown and matured a lot and im quite excited to see where it will be even 5 years from now. It honestly baffles me that the majority of more traditional "metalheads" think deathcore is all generic and boring, no talent required, and not even metal lol.
p4904
aVdefinitely miss all the mathcore and all the crazy fun deathcore.\u000a\u000ai love modern deathcore. but i miss when bands didn't give a fuck and just did silly shit all the time. (see you next tuesday, arsonists get all the girls, tony danza, horse the band, heavyheavylowlow, duck duck goose, ect)\u000a\u000aeven though it felt like they didn't take themselves seriously at all, their music was the bees knees. it was fun to listen to. still is. the shows were the shit. just insanity. 
p4905
aV[deleted]
p4906
aVHonestly, no. After bands like Whitechapel and Carnifex got popular, it became a massive fad. I can't praise an era that caused me to bear witness to Attila. I think that now, though, deathcore has variety and each band has an identity.
p4907
aVI miss Somatic Defilement
p4908
aVNot even a little bit. 06-08 death core is like an annoying kid brother that won't stop banging on your bedroom door, and stealing your fucking Nintendo to play with its shitty friend.\u000a\u000aI guess you guys don't understand similes. I was using the "banging door" as a comparison to how the bass drum was always too loud and muddy in the mix. The Nintendo thing was a simile for the obnoxious "iwrestledabearonce" style of songwriting.\u000a\u000aBut hey, this is reddit. So if your opinion differs from the norm, get down voted.

This is the last video he made. NSFL probably for some people who do not want to see the last words of person who then went and committed a school shooting. Though, this is pretty consistent with what we listen to on the daily if you're in this sub. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe quoted part is right at 5:30 or so. \u000a

aVYou never know man. Some people are really sensitive to that kind of thing. Also, that cat in certain parts of that video really looks like a small monkey. 
p4942
aVIngested doesnt change much between each album, but they seem to still progress and they sound more collected, like they started with one style of writing, and just continuously improved on the small problems rather than scraping it for the next album
p4943
aVIt's a masterpiece. I expected no less. 
p4944
aVThis album, Acrania's new album, and Vulvodynia's new album all fall in this new really exciting little bag for me. They are over the top brutal, but they maintain that groove and slam vibe (some more than others), that really bring a lot to the genre. \u000a\u000aI would love to see this trend continue. I like the way these albums are produced, but most of all, I really like the Slam meets Deathcore elements that all have. \u000a\u000aIf you have any recommendations for me, let me know!\u000a\u000aThis would have been my album of the year if it was release a few weeks earlier. I dig RoS new album and it's brutal. But it's not as brutal (imo) as this album which still maintains some technicality and who doesn't love some good ol' murder cut scenes in the middle too. \u000a\u000aI also love the instrumental on this album. I think it is one of my favorite tracks. The main riff that runs down the neck almost sounds like the Foo Fighters little movement down the neck in Everlong, but a lot heavier and with a lot of extra yummies going on in and around it.\u000a\u000aAny way, personally cannot say enough good stuff about it.

aVI assume because his parents or mother named him Vincent and not Vince and generally people like to be called my their proper names. 
p4951
aVPeople named Johnathan go by John though, that doesn't really seem like why.
p4952
aVBut not everyone subscribes to that idea, plenty of Matthews only want be called Matthew and not Matt, and vice versa. It's their name, they are free to reject the short version if they want. Like, if my name was William but you kept calling me Bill, I would think you were kinda being an asshole.
p4953
aVI believe it's because his father is called Vince, and he despises his father.\u000aNot completely sure.  That's what my friend)who is a huggeee TAS fan) told me.\u000a\u000aAlso, met Vincent on the Eternal Enemies Tour.  He is one of the most genuine, cool, nice person I have ever met.  We talked about his music, our shirts(TAS and Emmure crewnecks) and we took pictures. One of the best times of my life.

aVI like to run and listen to it. I remember running a race in moab Utah and being in the middle of nowhere, in the heat, listening to one of the later songs in the album (the most Mellow part of the album). It was almost out of body. 
p4980
aVThis is an awesome, well written description! Good job, dude!\u000a\u000a I've been pretty much out of deathcore for around 2 or so years now, but there's just something about The Acacia Strain's newer stuff that keeps me coming back. Wormwood got me listening to them again, and I kinda subconsciously took note of that doomy vibe, but I thought it was just the better production (in my opinion) that made it heavier. When they dropped Death is the Only Mortal, the first song I listened to was Brain Death. The first word that came to my mind after finishing that song was doom, and they do that shit WELL. They'll probably always be my jam when I'm pissed off.
p4981
aVMuch appreciated.  Death is the Only Mortal is a damn good listen for sure.\u000a
p4982
aVExcellent guide, this is my favorite band. You ever hear their demo from 2001? They sound nothing like they do now obviously, but it's a pretty interesting listen.

p4988
aVThank you.  It's getting my ass back into writing.  
p4989
aVI really think *The Dead Walk* is the peak of Acacia Strain.  It is a **perfect** metal album IMO.  It is just crushing, it has technical grooves and amazingly crafted breakdowns.  The instrumentals are 100% there.  As far as vocals are concerned, Vincent kills it every. fucking. second. of the album.\u000a\u000aContinent comes in second for me, and I love the album, but it doesn't come close to having the 'this album just doesn't fuck around' factor that Dead Walk does.\u000a\u000aComa Witch, I haven't listened to enough yet.  Gotta get some more plays in.  Some songs on the album kind of turn me off while others are pretty damn good.  Ever since Wormwood, I feel like the poor lyrics factor has been jumping up a bit (but thats just me).

aVyou should also mention TAS live is also very damn good, Coma witch and The Dead Walk are so heavy and so good. Solid guide

aVI honestly love every single song TAS ever put out since 3750, I don't really like ...And Life Is Very Long at all, I consider it more of a demo than an actual album.
p4992
aVYou should add above and below,that was a sick ep. Great writeup. 
p4993
aVI thought of doing that but decided against it because it always seemed their albums were where the large changes were made. I did consider doing a separate guide to their ep's, live recordings etc. Might do that if someone wants. 
p4994
aVSo who does everyone think I should do a guide for next? I like writing these.  
p4995
aVWell, you need to do something that seems relativly long/hard to get into. Personally, I've been wanting to get more into Job for a Cowboy. So thats my suggestion
p4996
aVA very good suggestion.  Hopefully the mods would be cool with it as their later work is more technical death metal than deathcore.
p4997
aVcan't wait ;)

aVOne of the things i like most about TAS (aside from the music) is the artwork, especially Wormwood and Coma Witch.

aVI'm a big fan of KC! But their situation right now is strange to me. They lost both James (The guttural vocalist) and Chris (The drummer/ backup vocalist) and when they finally found replacements they went almost inactive. To me it seems like Bryan (As far as I know he's supposed to be the new vocalist for KC) is only working with dealey plaza and it feels like he's ignoring the fact that KC exists. This is just one of my theories and I hope that they will arise from the ashes soon.\u000a\u000aI don't know really but I hope they will release some new stuff in the future. \u000a\u000aEdit: Just added some things.

aVthis
p5025
aVA million fucking times this!!! \u000aEasily my favorite all shall perish song and probably top 10 deathcore songs 
p5026
aVEddie Hermida is the best deathcore vocalist this side of Phil Bozeman. Hes insane live too. May be an unpopular opinion but he was SUCH an upgrade over Mitch Lucker.
p5027
aVI'm a little salty that he chose Suicide Silence over All Shall Perish, practically causing their disbanding.
p5028
aVActually kinda me too. SS's instrumentals are nowhere near the quality of ASP.
p5029
aVI agree with this. All Shall Perish had (has?) much more musical talent, but pre-Black Crown SS was fucking brutal man.
p5030
aVSS's problem was never musical talent, it's composition. Both their guitarists are excellent at what they do, and every drummer they've had thus far has been a force to be reckoned with, but no matter what they struggle to translate that skill into interesting and captivating instrumental composition. Case and point: the solo in "Wake Up". There's nothing bad about it, but it completely lacks the energy of the rest of the song and almost takes away from it.
p5031
aVMan I've tried to describe what SS lacked, and this explains it perfectly. If Mitch wasn't one of if not the best frontmen SS would have been another dime a dozen myspace bands. And that's coming from a huge SS fan.
p5032
aVI always thought Mitch's vocals were grossly overrated, but he was a tremendous performer.
p5033
aVHis highs back in the day were great,  but his lows were not too great live. He destroyed small venues. I liked seeing him in big places, but those 500-200 people venues with him got fucking nuts. 
p5034
aV[MetalSucks](http://www.metalsucks.net/2015/01/06/shall-perish-release-new-album-year/) posted an article in January saying All Shall Perish will be putting out a new album this year.  Still not entirely sure what their line-up will be though.  
p5035
aVAren't ASP and SS both on Nuclear Blast, maybe Eddie will be able to do both bands, I just wished Ben Orum would still be in ASP. Either way, this is great news.
p5036
aVI had to look it up - but yeah they're both on Nuclear Blast. Agreed on Ben still being in the band.
p5037
aVHe is seriously underrated, I think he even sounded a bit better live back when they were touring for this and TPOE. Back in the day they were a serious force to be reckoned with.

p5077

p5078

p5082

p5084
aVI've seen him more times than I can count and I'll have to agree. He's SO hit and miss, it's really frustrating. 
p5085
aVIt depends how drunk he gets before, i had a beer with him and Lee after a show one night and he was completely blind
p5086

aVI've seen them 3 times and he's been perfect every time. I hope the next time or any after he's just as amazing :/

p5104
(lp5105
V&gt; Posts Chelsea Grin in /r/deathcore\u000a\u000a&gt; lololol so underrated
p5106
aVFirst thing I thought too. Chelsea grin was rocketed into fame with this album and they are arguably one of the most well known deathcore bands
p5107
aVRight? A song from this album gets posted here at least once a day, so saying that either this *specific*  album, or the band themselves, are underrated is just plain malarkey.
p5108
aVI thought it was 'Recreant' and latter Don't Ask Don't Tell that did that.\u000a\u000a\u000aJust like I said in the other post, people give them shit for their new stuff with Jason (i actually like it, but not as much as this) and look back to DoE and their EP as their good ol' days and completely ignore this album, that's mainly the reason i think it's a bit underrated. Being underrated doesn't mean they need to have below 10k likes on facebook.
p5109
aVThis specific album, not the band
p5110
aVNot even close to being underrated. 
p5111
aVHey not my words, I agree
p5112
aVBy far their best album, then it went downhill. 
p5113
aVPeople always look at Desolation of Eden or even their shitty EP as their glory days, but I always looked this album as their best, and one of the best deathcore albuns ever. It had atmosphere and showed Alex's best performance (some people might not stand his highs, but i think they're pretty unique and very black metalish) which set them apart from everything else. With that being said, underrated=\u005c=underground or not famous.
p5114
aVShitty EP???
p5115
aVYes, their shitty EP. \u000a\u000aAgreed fully with you though Jorge.

asVI really like the intensity of this genre, heavy/death/black metal/core etc., but it seems like these genres are saturated by bands with really good lyricists/vocalists and terrible instrumentalists, what do you guys think?
p5138
(lp5139
VI feel the opposite way actually, I think that too often I will love a band's instrumentals but the vocals turn me off so much I can't make it through one track
p5140
aVI can agree with that too, but sometimes I find the lyrics to be redeeming enough to forgive some bad vocals. It does get on my nerves as much though most of the time.
p5141
aVExactly my problem with deathcore.
p5142
aVThat's how I feel about Infant Annihilator. The vocals make it completely unlistenable to me.
p5143
aVWell, what do you think of this stuff?\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJADFkEkrOs\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0D9Mqb86lI\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep5i7xqsIOg\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN3hv5PfoVA\u000a\u000aAnd I think a lot of the reason for the simplistic song structure is because deathcore is a derivative of hardcore, which usually has a pretty simple song structure.
p5144
aVHow did I know that was veil haha
p5145
aVI liked the way the instruments were used in all of those. But I know what you mean, I just find myself wishing that there was a genre where the music had really complex structure, orchestral vocalists (essentially ethereal wave music), but with the intensity of metal and the killer beats found in hip-hop and rap. I've yet to find it but deathcore definitely has the passion I like to hear from the singers. I just find the vocals to be really hit and miss when it comes to songs with good instrumentalists, sometimes they're mind-numbing and nothing more than guttural shrieks or screaming that I can barely understand, other times they're legible and sound awesome but without the speedy delivery or the impressive lyrics you find in rap. Conversely, I find myself listening to rap, the rapper lays down some sick lines, but the music is boring and the beat is all synth'd instead of made with real instruments. Didn't mean to rant, the 2nd and 4th videos were awesome though, the rest I couldn't really understand the words, thanks for the recommendations!
p5146
aV^couldnt really understand the wordsThat's like 75% of the genres vocals
p5147
aVYou can check out my band [Windy City Slaughter](http://youtu.be/_Wd6bcH9ywo).  We're a deathcore band, but I definitely feel we break the mold in a lot of ways.\u000a\u000aI agree that there are many in the genre who are stuck emulating bands they listen to, instead of really having a voice and expressing it through their music.  I think this is why a lot of people hate on deathcore - because there are tons of bad deathcore bands.  However, I think there  more than a few bands that give deathcore a solid name.
p5148
aVCheck out some all shall parish

VAnimosity's 3rd album Animal, the song "You Can't Win". I was in college at UC Santa Cruz at the time and my girlfriend's sister Rebecca was dating the lead singer of **Animosity**, Leo Miller. It was my 21st birthday, Oct 1st 2005 when I got a call from Leo saying Rebecca had been in a motorcycle accident on the way to his concert in San Francisco and she was dead.\u000a\u000aThe song lyric: *"Not a day goes by when I didn't wish I were still living in September 2005."* is because Rebecca was still alive in September 2005. She was 19 years old. Hit by a neo-nazi fuckhead 2 weeks out of prison driving on meth on the opposite side of the road (he got 40 years for 2nd degree murder).\u000a\u000aWe had to call their parent's to say what happened that night.

I enjoyed Black Heart Market a lot.  \u000a\u000a**All Shall Perish - Songs for the Damned** - The awesomeness in this song is just too much to bear.  a.  It name drops a shit tone of classic metal albums.  b.  it has a profound sense of unhappiness in it.  Just fantastic.  \u000a\u000aAlso, if you are into hardcore/metalcore much at all:  \u000aDamnation A.D - No More Dreams of Happy Endings  \u000aPoison the Well - The Opposite of December  \u000aAmerican Nightmare - Background Music  \u000aMisery Signals - Of Malice and the Magnum Heart  \u000aDisembodied - If Only God Knew the Rest Were Dead  \u000aAll Else Failed - Archetype  \u000a\u000aThese albums have been chosen as all of them have lots of overarching themes of sadness, misery, pain, depression and what have you.  I have a crap ton of this type of stuff.  Especially All Else Failed's Archetype, holy shit, just listen to The Hutton Play on that album.  That is pure misery he's conveying.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVLet Me In by Make Them Suffer. The video is a real downer, too.
p5184
aVNot much deathcore thats sad, an that being said I cant think of any. But for sad music theres some albums you could try, like Illuminate by Lydia, Seahaven's most recent album (really any of their music but its the most down sounding), some songs by Brand New such as "At the Bottom", "Degausser", "Luca", "You wont know".. Fuck it a lot of their songs too. My favorite acoustic artist Radical Face is great for everything, especially when youre feeling down because it can also lift you back up or keep you there if you want to be. Feel better man

aVNailgun bores me too, but this one is my favourite from the new stuff by far.
p5207
aVI'm glad someone enjoys it. I really have gotten bored of this genre in the last couple years. I'm not sure why, but I find myself listening to more 90s music like Soundgarden, Down, and that first Stone Sour album type stuff. Maybe I'm older and more boring? I just feel like I'm not as angry as I used to be and this genre has gotten stale sounding to my ears. I still enjoy the 06-09 era of deathcore/whatevercore but as of late bands I love have just made me press the snooze button. This of course, does not include seeing these bands live.\u000a\u000aNo disrespect to anybody who likes the new TAS stuff, because music is subjective and it's all a matter of taste (just to avoid arguments).
p5208
aVI've been moving toward 90s music and Tool these days, but a good show is always welcome. I don't find myself jamming this stuff in the car nearly as much anymore tho. We gettin old breh

aVAll the years of angsty teen hatred has tired me out. Life got me all like, deleting my fb and not caring about what people do, say, or share. I'm all, in the woods hiking n fishin. ya know, doing shit that makes my insides feel good. Got a gray hair in my beard now. We old my nugraz. \u000a\u000aBut I can still go to a TAS or Hatebreed show and stomp around wearing nothing relevant to the hilariously awful bro-core shirts with angry statements on them as a sign of my masculinity and distaste for the culture and world around me.

This is one of my absolute favorites in this small microcosm of deathcore.  \u000a[Continent - Decaying Days](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxzFSjxSTcU) - Here's a newer one that I've gotten into.  Really dark and doomey sounding.  It plods and seeths with absolute hatred.  \u000a[Face Your Maker - Tyranny](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmz7aLrqLZ8) - Another fantastic band here.

This band was recommended to me by someone else on this particular sub(though who it was escapes me.)  Either way, gave it a listen and immediately got all of their stuff.  It's weird, heavy, and nightmarish sounding type stuff.  Definitely damn good.  Excellent Halloween music too.

aVThe only band IMO that completely fused mathcore and deathcore into a single genre.  Yes there's Danza and Rings of Saturn, but I find them more of mathcore with breakdowns.  I highly recommend listening to Dysphorias previous 2 albums, but do note that the first album needs to be listened to from beginning to end to comprehend it: the first 3 tracks are all just chugging, while the last tracks are straight up mathcore.  It's not until the 2nd album that the 2 genres are pretty much fused together.  Can't wait to see what they do in the future.
p5275
aVYeah, I've given their 2nd album a few listens and I like it, but haven't listened to the first yet. I agree that this is the most balanced mathcore/deathcore mix, I've wanted something like this for a long time.

p5317
aVI love Attila,not all the time,but they're fun to jam once in a while. Just fun music. New album is alright,wish it was as heavy as About That Life but still okay.
p5318
aVThe new album is actually in a lower tuning, but the reason it feels less heavy is because the breakdowns are more hardcore-oriented. A lot of syncopated, 2-step riffs. About That Life was more about the groove, and that the vocals were more metal-centric, it's much heavier overall. \u000a\u000aThe new album is kind of confusing imo. I like most of it, but a lot of it is pretty forgettable compared to About That Life.

aV&gt; Some might say it sounds over-produced\u000a\u000aI don't mind slick production. Aren't Betraying the Martyrs one of the few deathcore groups that has cleans?

aVYeah they use a fair amount of cleans on this album too.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KebRqQMk6Q) is the album, I should've linked it in the original comment.  They still go pretty hard and the cleans are usually pretty well done.

p5343
aVHard to say, maybe a fair bit now that Mosh Lucker is dead, i could see some fangirls paying upwards of $50 for it.
p5344
aVI'd prolly pay about $50 for that.  That album was pretty important to my taste development and I want to have hard copies of those important albums, but I don't think I'd care about those signatures the second I put it away
p5345
aVAgreed. This album definitely influenced my tastes. I actually have the  CD mounted in a frame with some pictures from the show where I got the sigs.  Good times, sad Mitch is gone though.\u000a\u000aThank for the input

aVI have it too, never realized it was rare, im interested to see what people are willing to pay
p5347
aVNo one is going to pay over 20$ for it I'm sure
p5348
aVI reckon it would go for more than that. I have no idea how many Mitch signed before his death, but I can't imagine that the number was too high. I can't find any signed copies of it online, so it would be interesting to see what it would go for on Ebay if you ever sold it.

p5539
aVThis is taken from their Facebook:\u000a\u000a&gt;Mainly because why not? Originally when we "got together", we were throwing around all these stupid "spr srs" deathcore band names like "Eden In Ruins" and "Gaia Aflame" and stuff of that ilk, but Jonas had put together a placeholder logo (using a font similar to a certain band on Sumerian Records with a fondness for aliens...) that just said "SLICE THE CAKE", and we figured it was a solid option. Plus, band names in this sort of music are getting beyond ridiculous with the amount of near-identical patterns, that soon we're just going to run out of combinations of "metal" sounding words. The logical conclusion is that we'll end up with stuff like "Slice the Cake" and "Toast the Bread", so we ran with it. Oh, and of course, because "it's all about the music, maaaaaan."

p5594
aVWhich is fair. I'm not really on anyone's side. The way they executed things was shady, but I can understand being annoyed when someone asks you to change your lifestyle. They've been doing things the same way for years, and for him to come in and ask them to change the way things operate is a little shady as well.

p5599
aVI'll give you that, the ambiance and the drums were pretty stellar but the vocals and rhythm work really killed the feel for me. Follow the signs and devastate are some of my favorite tracks but the never ending breakdown formula really undermines the lead work in my opinion.\u000a\u000aThat being said I still listen to the discovery from time to time, I can't stand Chelsea grin though.
p5600
aVThat's a fair criticism. As for CG, I'm really picky with them. I don't really like any full albums, but I probably like half the songs on all of them.

aV&gt; simply beautiful. its a shame that most people don't see past the distortion, tattoos, and aggressive sound to perceive the inherent beauty of music like this. it is darkly sweet.\u000a\u000aCouldn't have put it better myself.  This is some of the of the most dark/beautiful music out there.  \u000a\u000aYou're right: the listening curve for things like: growling, 1/32nd note kick drum triplets and distorted guitars, is very steep. That is - it takes some time for a new listener to acquire the vernacular that's needs to appreciate the harmony and the rhythm that's inside of this music. \u000a\u000aI.E I've played something like ["Planetary Duality Pt. I"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwyUq_0R_XE) for experienced musicians, and mostly, they can't even process what their hearing.  And/or have a bashful/defensive reaction to the growing and can't hear past it!

aVThe Discovery is *older* than Tomorrow We Die Alive
p5609
aVWell, yeah. But that doesn't mean that The Discovery is "old" by any means.
p5610
aVI'm sorry, I should have said, "Damn I miss the Born of Osiris from 2011."
p5611
aVOr you could have just said what everyone else already has. "I wish Jason was in Born of Osiris still." \u000a\u000aI'm not trying to be a dick. I just thought it was interesting that people regarded The Discovery as "old" Born of Osiris. To me, old Born of Osiris is like, The New Reign and back.

aVIt's always boggled my mind that people have claimed this guy has no range.\u000a\u000aEven before his highs improved he could go higher than a lot of vocalists in Deathcore, but, to top it off, his highs have improved a lot. \u000a\u000aPeople also seem to forget that highs \u2260 range. If you can go really high, but your "lows" sound like mids without any enunciation (a huge problem in Deathcore), you don't have range.

aVI dunno but im pretty sure its him, usually bands dont have a fill in singer.
p5791
aVHe could very well be a session vocalist until they find a full-time replacement. Bands have session artists come in and record all the time. It happens less often with vocalists, but it does indeed happen.\u000a\u000aI know personally, I'll be waiting for an official confirmation from the band before I assume anything.

p5795
(lp5796
VThe beginning of the song starts with a poem by Aleister Crowley named "The Poet."  Here is the full poem by him:  \u000a\u000a\u000aBury me in an nameless grave!  \u000aI came from god the world to save.  \u000aI brought them wisdom from above:  \u000aWorship, and Liberty, and Love.  \u000aThey slew me for I did disparage  \u000aTherefore Religion, Law, and Marriage.  \u000aSo be my grave without a name  \u000aThat earth may swallow up my shame! \u000a\u000a[Here is the Wiki article on him to give you a general idea of the man who wrote the poem.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley)   \u000a\u000a[Here is the reading of the poem recorded in 1920](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMJ5bD5iclw)\u000a\u000a\u000a

asVHester Prynne - Black Heart Market
p5811
(lp5812
VI loved this band. Anyone know whatever happened to them?
p5813
aVThey semi hung it up. They went quiet after the Goswell Divorce. Then they did a kickstarter and raised money for their new album which they released themselves. It was a great effort. After releasing the album, they went quiet again. Overall, I think the lead singer drives a lot of the direction for how active the band is (or this is the feel I get from their FB). He also seems like he has a hard life (I am speaking from pure speculation), but it seemed like he started getting passionate to a fault at the end. Anyway, my two cents. If you go to their FB, you can find a lot of what I am talking about. 
p5814
aVThey did a kickstarter and kind of ripped off a bunch of their fans, then they deleted comments of people calling them out on Facebook, and eventually deleted their entire page.
p5815
aVPersonally, The Goswell Divorce was much better, lyric and instrumental - wise, one of my all time favorite albums. Don't get me wrong, I love Black Heart Market, but I was expecting a more solid album. Some parts just lacked and seemed almost empty, whereas the Goswell Divorce was as solid as it gets.

p5822
aVSo what was the battle about?
p5823
aVProbably there was a fight between them and their past label. Im guessing they had to get the rights to the ep back but had trouble getting it.
p5824
aVYeah now that I think of it, the EP was released through statik factory.
p5825
aVI'm not really sure since no information was ever released about anything related to that. Personally I think they just couldn't release them because the label thought they might not have made profit and since it's available digitally. 
p5826
aVThink they will eventually release the ep just like the rest of their cds?

p5831
aVSpicy drama!
p5832
aVWow, I didn't know Lucas Mann was such a dick.
p5833
aVthere are very "subtle" hints at it or ... obvious. 
p5834
aVWhen I bought merch off him at a show he just kinda stared blankly at me while Ian shook my hand with a smile and made small talk. I knew at that point that the rumors about Lucas were true.
p5835
aVi met him around the time he started saying "if you want to see ROS come out because this will be the last time we do something" or whatever. as if HE controlled the band? fuck id say kick him out. It seems he is the problem in itself. Like ok you're a good manager and everything but a lazy piece of shit and wont learn your new songs when everyone else is capable so you set them back? Nothing in a band makes YOUR say higher than anyone else. I don't give a fuck. 
p5836
aVI had the same experience at Summer Slaughter with him.
p5837
aVJoel's a better guitarist, and I listen to RoS entirely for him and Ian, so I'm not too upset about this. I actually really hope Ian and Aaron leave RoS as well and do something with Joel in the future. Lucas is the only thing holding them back, clearly.
p5838
aVHe did act like a douche in his Shards of Scorched Flesh playthrough, kinda assumed it was an act or just a big fuck you to the haters. Hmm well what do ya know

p5846
aVThis is really disappointing for me because I love ROS. I wonder if they could function without Lucas if they found a suitable replacement for him. Sounds like it may be for the best.
p5847
aVThe band would not be able to function what so ever if Luke left the band. he handles everything; booking tours, handling the merch store, shipping merch. handling details about shipping merch to each venue, helping Joel replace all his equipment (replace guitars, guitar strings) also trying to teach that fuck how to use his ax fx and set his tone, he also handles shit with the label and his management, making sure his van is able to make the tours that they do do, making sure band mates are able to make it out via flight or him having to drive his ass to go pick them up or buying their plane ticket, hashing out details with recording studios and labels to record, handling doing guest solo for other bands, trying to track down artist to make guest appearance in an album, not to mention all the bad press he gets from butt hurt ex members speaking out realizing how good they had it when they were in the band. literally this band would crash and burn if it wasn't for Luke. crash and burn.
p5848
aV&gt; handling the merch store, shipping merch. handling details about shipping merch\u000a\u000aand i still haven't got my order from back in september

p5851
aVWell just because hes your friend and in a sort of kind of successful band doesnt mean hes not a douchebag.
p5852
aVI honestly don't know what to believe it's one persons word against the other. I have no concrete evidence beyond the fact that they have horrible member turnover 
p5853
aVIt doesn't matter who you are on Earth. It doesn't matter what you've done, or what you've left behind. When the aliens arrive, they will slaughter every last one of us without discrimination. Every last one of us will suffer and die, and not a trace of this species will be left on the planet. So we may as well be good to each other now. So stop being a dick, Lucas. 
p5854
aVITT: Luke's Highschool friends pretending to be impartial. 
p5855
aV**TL;DR**\u000a\u000a'I got sick of playing retarded aliencore with this dumb ass and decided to go to school as I approach my mid twenties'\u000a\u000aEDIT: One quick zip through anything press related that has Lucas Mann at the helm kind of proves what Joel is saying here. From ignoring fans, to 'not having fun' on tour, to cutting supporting acts set time short, to overpriced merchandise. Then reading that they haven't been playing any new material is a joke. Its good that he is getting away from this before it implodes.\u000a\u000aRemember Lucas Mann asked 20k for a solo album.
p5856

aVGod damn, really going for the throat there. Lucas sounds like a total piece of shit, too.
p5863
aVYeah, I've heard that the RoS guys are...not nice. Apparently they contacted the admins on thedailymosh and told them not to even discuss their band in any capacity, which is weird.
p5864
aVI'm pretty sure it's just Lucas. I've talked to Joel and Ian every time I've seen them, and they've all been super nice and help up great conversations. Lucas on the other hand was either nowhere to be found, or just glaring at people no joke. 
p5865
aVI saw him about 15 feet away from me at a show a couple of months ago and said "Is that Lucas Mann?" to my friend standing next to me, but also loud enough so that Luke heard. He seriously turned around and just glared at me without smiling at me at all, it was pretty hilarious.
p5866
aVRoS is Luke's baby. I actually was in a band with Luke in high school, so I got to see the dynamic of his musical workflow. \u000a\u000ahe built RoS from the ground up, so he's kind of the ring leader of the whole thing. sucks this guy left the band and is bitter about it, but so be it. 
p5867
aVreal talk, same boat best friends with Luke since freshmen year. it is his baby. the only people that have been super chill about leaving the band were Ian, Jesse, and Shawn. Brett took it hard, and now Joel apparently.

Drop G is also a nice tuning if you want to take things lower.

aVTriple drop L# dude only way to be brutal.\u000a\u000aIn all seriousness, there are so many different tunings you can use for deathcore, especially with a 7 string. \u000a\u000aDrop E works great for really djenty stuff, provided you have the means to get the right tone for it. It's much easier to use on an 8 string though, as it doesn't cut off the range so much with that extra top string. Bands like Galactic Pegasus and Delusions of Grandeur use this tuning quite often.\u000a\u000aDrop F# is my personal favourite for getting that tight, but gritty sound for killer riffs and slams. Bands like Infant Annihilator play in this tuning, and it's great for 7 strings playing anything from deathcore to doom metal. \u000a\u000aBut you're probably better off going for something like Drop A, if you're just playing straight-up deathcore tunes, or the classic Drop G# if you want to be able to get pretty brutal with it.
p6013
aVThanks I'll give it a try, I thought about buying an 8 string but I didnt even know what to do with 7 so I'll work my way up haha 
p6014
aVI use a six string. Tune to C sharp. Heavy yet somehow "different". Once I started playing on it I couldn't stop. 
p6015
aVYea thats is what I have my six string in but I just got bored needed something heavier

asVNOCTURNAL BLOODLUST - DESPERATE (Japanese deathcore)
p6017
(lp6018
VFucking love this band, but I'd say they're metalcore before anything else. The orchestration of the heavier aspects never really touch on a deathcore formula to be honest, and the fact that nearly every song has cleans pushes it in that direction. Their screamer is fucking brutal though, and Grimoire is an awesome record, so I digress.
p6019
aVI'd say it's a mix of both.  \u000aThere are tracks on some of the older albums that are heavier then the heaviest shit I've seen on here.  \u000aUnfortunately the fact that they look like asian anime cosplayers turns many off, give these guys a chance.

It's long but it sums up their sound really well. \u000a\u000aI'd also recommend The Contortionist's album [Exoplanet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GGPFioA8Wc). Their more recent albums are prog metal, but this one is a seamless fusion of proper deathcore and progressive melodies. I'm into post-rock as well so that may be why I like this particular sound so much.

They've definitely moved on a bit from the more brutal deathcore sound, but it's all still great!

p6204
aVWhat albums did he record for? Looking up ASP's discog and I can't seem to see him in any of the personnel notes. I know he briefly toured with them, but was unaware he recorded some of their material and would like to check it out.

aVAshes to ashes is just a shit album.

p6207
aVIMO Self-Titled, DoE and My Damnation are their best work. Not so into the other stuff. Still can't believe how disappointing Ashes to Ashes is, was the album I looked the most foreward to in 2014...
p6208
aVI 100% agree with you. The lyrics sound like some 14 year old emo girl wrote them. Evolve was also my favorite work they've ever done too.
p6209
aVThe lyrics are terrible!! I feel like they did fine instrumentally but even then the breakdowns are weak and forced, if you can even call them that. 
p6210
aVYeah I mean the album is still heavy, and the guitar solos are awesome, but I just can't get around the shitty emo lyrics. Basically every song is "oh look at us, we're really hardcore, fuck the police, get drunk"\u000a
p6211
aVIf Alex would have stepped up the album would probably be a 9~10 for me. Hopefully next album..

asVMake Them Suffer - Weeping Wastelands
p6231
(lp6232
Veughhhhh eughhhh EUGHHHHHHHH
p6233
aVThis song really showed how goddamned brutal they really can be. 
p6234
aVOne of my favorites from them.
p6235
aVToo bad they are kind of straying away from deathcore. Their newest song was too metalcore for me
p6236
aVI'm pretty sure they released a statement that said "let me in" was the elegies equivalent on their new album. 
p6237
aVIt's really hard to judge how a band is moving their entire sound with one song ya know 
p6238
aVI agree, but i was not a fan of that song AT ALL
p6239
aVI didn't like it the most either, but I'm sure their new album is going to be nuts.

p6247
(lp6248
VThis band...mmmmmm miss them
p6249
aVOne of the first bands I heard when I got into Deathcore, fucking loved it.
p6250
aVStill one of the craziest shows I've been too. 
p6251
aVLast time I saw them was with Catherine and Stick to your guns in a music store back in 2007ish. One of the best shows I've ever been to. 150 people crammed into a FYE and moshed in the little space they opened up. Glory days.
p6252
aVI saw this same tour in Ottawa. I've never seen so many pile ups for a band. I was ontop of one and touching the ceiling of the venue. Shit was packed.\u000a
p6253
aVI listen to incinerate almost every day on my train ride home while packed bear people. "40,000 people die every day, how come you're not one them?"

p6258
aVGood list
p6259
aVGood list but i don't get the love for The Somatic Defilement, i always thought that was de worst Whitechapel album by far.
p6260
aVThat was my first foray into the genre, it was so raw and heavy. This is Exile blew me away but after that I didn't really care for Whitechapel anymore. 
p6261
aVDanza isn't deathcore, but good list. 
p6262
aV1. Whitechapel - A New Era Of Corruption \u000a2. Thy Art Is Murder -  Hate\u000a3. The Last Felony - To Many Humans\u000a4. Ovid's Withering - Scryers Of The Ibis\u000a5. I Declare War - Self Titled\u000a6. The Acacia Strain - Death Is The Only Mortal\u000a7. Humanity's Last Breath -  Self Titled \u000a8. Fit For An Autopsy - Hellbound \u000a9. Impending Doom - There Will Be Violence\u000a10. Born Of Osiris -  The Discovery \u000a\u000aIt's hard to really put these in order, I just wrote them as they came to me. Also I went with one album per band. 
p6263
aVAnybody?\u000a\u000a1. Thy Art is Murder - Infinite Death\u000a2. As blood runs black - Allegiance \u000a3. Signal The Firing Squad - Earth Harvest \u000a4. Carnifex - Dead In My Arms\u000a5. Oceano - Depths \u000a6. Born of Osiris - The Discovery \u000a7. All Shall Perish - The Price of Existence \u000a8. Salt The Wound - Carnal Repercussions\u000a9. Point Below Zero - Point Below Zero EP \u000a10. Whitechapel - This is Exile
p6264
aV1) Ingested - The Architect Of Extinction\u000a\u000a- These guys are lyrical geniuses. The flow and way every single song and even sentence was put together was just perfect.\u000a\u000a2) Black Toungue - Born Hanged / Falsifier [Redux]\u000a\u000a- For anyone who hasn't checked out the Redux, it's SO much better than the normal EP's and amazingly Brutal in my opinion.\u000a\u000a3) Rings of Saturn - Lugal Ki En\u000a\u000a- Perfect combination between technicality and musicality in one album.\u000a\u000a4) Thy Art Is Murder - Hate\u000a\u000a- Pure brutality.\u000a\u000a5) Infant Annihilator - The Palpable Leprosy Of Pollution\u000aNow, these guys don't take themselves too serious, but I think that Eddie Pickard and Aaron Kitcher are an amazingly deadly combination. A very good mix between brutality, technicality and musicality.\u000a\u000a6) Thy Art Is Murder - Infinite Death EP\u000a\u000a- It was good, but it was a bit too chaotic for me. Still an amazing EP with some insane lyrics.\u000a\u000a7) Born of Osiris - Tomorrow We Die Alive\u000a\u000a- Just felt like should put this here, although it may be considered Metalcore, I think its lyrics were quite different and it had a nice techno kind of feel to it.\u000a\u000a8) Veil of Maya - Eclipse\u000a\u000a- It's different, in a rather positive way. It had some more flow than the typical Deathcore album for me.\u000a\u000a9) Rings of Saturn - Enbryotic Anomaly\u000a\u000a- Sheer awesomeness and it being the first album of an amazing new twist to the genre.\u000a\u000a10) Suicide Silence - The Cleansing.\u000a\u000a- I know that this will be a rather unpopular opinion but I think that this is just one of the classics. It's the album that got me into Deathcore and I still like it.\u000a
p6265
aVThis is a really good list. Pretty much every album on it is among my favorite of all time.

p6268
aV&gt;Ovid's Withering - Scryers of the Abyss\u000a\u000aJust a heads up, it's "Ibis", not "Abyss". I wouldn't normally have the sense to correct it, but I'm wearing the shirt right now.\u000a\u000aThat aside, your list is legit as fuck. Shadow Of The Colossus is a grossly underrated band.
p6269
aV&gt; That aside, your list is legit as fuck. Shadow Of The Colossus is a grossly underrated band\u000a\u000ai don't think i'll ever get tired of listening to End Game, i wish they hurry up and put it on spotify 
p6270
aVoh just buy it, they deserve the money
p6271
aVI rarely like to buy cd's internationally and they have no Australian sites selling it, they also shut down their merch site.
p6272
aVso no bandcamp
p6273
aVSeriously. Sotc not being on Spotify sucks. 
p6274
aVHad this thread open on a tab for awhile to come back and check out some of these bands. On Spotify. Shadow of the Colossus was my first try. Stupid me.

aVI would switch the rings of Saturn album to LeK. That first album was just too much,too chaotic with no balance or structure. It was good,but just too much.
p6310
aVHaven't gotten around to listening to their other albums yet, so can't really pick LeK over Embryonic, but the chaotic nature is what I like about it
p6311
aVLek fucking rips. I didn't care for dingir, but Lek is their climax imo\u000a
p6312
aVI'm sorry man, but if you didn't care for dingir you just didn't listen to it enough. Every single song off of dingir is beyond groovy and brutal as fuck. Objective to harvest, galactic cleansing, dingir, faces imploding, fruitless existence, immaculate order, utopia....seriously some of my favorite songs of all time.\u000a\u000aLook up the lyrics while you listen to the album too...especially faces imploding...incredible lyrics.

aVOh yeah, Joe is definitely a funny dude! But I think as far as actual personableness goes, Ronnie is by far the most friendly and easy to talk to. He seemed to genuinely appreciate it when I complimented his live vocals, and we even had a good 5 minute conversation. Obviously 5 minutes of small talk with a fan means jack shit to him, but I immensely respect any band member that makes an effort to connect with fans despite how exhausting playing a half hour set and doing meet and greets may be.
p6330
aVYeah, definitely agree with you on that

(lp6358
VThis album really grew on me over the course of the year. Bought a physical copy last week.
p6359
aVAgreed.  Not album of the year material for me, but definitely ended up liking it the more I listened.
p6360
aVComing from someone who only really like The Somatic Defilement, the new record is definitely a "grows on you" type. Phil's vocals are great as always, and they're still very dynamic in a much different way, and the groove is undeniable. But while I've grown to like it over time, this new record kind of lacks the punch that TSD and their other earlier stuff had.
p6361
aVThe part I miss most from their current sound is the brutal death aspect they had.  I do like that their earlier albums were more murky and super brutal.
p6362
aVthis is the only song I liked from the album
p6363
aVThis was the only one?  Did you dislike "Blacked Out"?  I wasn't too keen on this record but that track stood out to me.
p6364
asVSo im new to Aegaeon
p6365
(lp6366
VDefinitely best to start with Exponential Transcendence then go into Dissension, check out Neural Union with the new vocalist first if you want.\u000a\u000aFavourite songs would be Neural Union, A Product Of Variety, Reshaping The Mulverse, Dimensions Of Reality and Demise.
p6367
aVI always think the best way to get into a band is to listen to their discography chronologically, see how the band progresses
p6368
aVThat is usually what I do, but just wanted some suggestions
p6369
aVThey don't have that much material, three EPs and a full length last time I checked, so it shouldn't be hard to go through all of it. 
p6370
aVI personally love their first EP. It's so dark and brutal, I suggest that you just start there and then move forward in their discography.

aVVeil of Maya - The Common Man's Collapse\u000a\u000a- Pillars  \u000a- We Bow in It's Aura  \u000a- All Eyes Look Ahead\u000a\u000aPillars warms you up, we bow crushes your balls, then it calms down to a dark chug.  Then all eyes brings it back up to the insanity we are used to with VoM, particularly the first 20 seconds or so.  Song stays strong and wild but does a slow taper.  The mood of this string of songs is like twin peaks.  Slow ascent, sheer ascent, peak, long gradual descent, sheer ascent, peak, small drop, ridgeline, descent.  I really like it, and have listened to it many times.
p6482
aVWe Bow in its Aura is my favorite VoM song, love that weird synthy part
p6483
aVIt's my favorite too.  I only wish they kept up the madness in the beginning for longer.  The rest of the song is a little too chuggy for me.

asVQuestion about programming drums!!
p6562
(lp6563
VAny program that can give you a midi output can be used, then you need to replace the (almost always really crappy) standard midi sounds with something half decent, which is a process I know basically nothing about. Sorry I couldn't be of more help, man.
p6564
aVMy guitarist programs all of the drums I actually play, I'm not sure how he does it, but he uses the program mixcraft. It's fairly simple I believe 
p6565
aVI'm gunna check that out when I get off work. Any idea if its free?
p6566
aVNahhh but you can torrent it lol. He got it off a friend that actually bought it. 
p6567
aVwhat part of it is confusing you? i've programmed an album + few EP's worth of drums, could probably help you out.
p6568
aVHonestly I don't even know where to start or what programs to use. I play guitar and have messed around with audacity to record. Basically I don't want to buy something and end up not being able to use it. What do you use/recommend?
p6569
aVOK this can get long real easily, but I will try to distill it down to some basic concepts.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, you're going to need a way to sequence the drums. Either get a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation, basically any recording program like Logic, Pro Tools, Cubase, Reaper, Audacity, etc)  better than audacity that has something called a Piano Roll on it (which allows you to sequence MIDI notes in time with whatever song you're working on) or get TuxGuitar/Guitarpro/Powertab, any program that lets you write a drum track and export it as MIDI data. If you use a program like TuxGuitar, you'll still need a DAW that you can import the MIDI date into to be interpreted by your drum machine.\u000a\u000aNext you'll need a program that can interpret that MIDI data and host a drum machine in it. For example, I use Steven Slate Drums hosted within Logic. I program my drums either in the Piano Roll in Logic or in Tuxguitar (in which case I'd export the drums as MIDI data and import into a track on Logic which has Steven Slate Drums on it). There's lots of other drum programs, some don't need to be hosted in a DAW to produce sound, but might not have a way to interpret MIDI data that you'd feed it, they might need the DAW's interpretive ability cause it's not built into the program. I THINK (not sure) EZDrummer is a standalone program that has an arrange function where you can drop in your MIDI date, or program your own. Not entirely sure, look it up on your own. I know Steven Slate is just a drum machine; you can edit what drum sounds you're using, what MIDI note triggers what drum, mix the drums within Steven Slate and/or send aux tracks out in Logic to separate each drum sound.\u000a\u000aThen of course you need to know how to write drum beats. Best advice: make sure you know how meter and rhythm works, you should be comfortable with concepts like time signatures (at least basic ones like 4/4, 3/4, 6/8) and whole, half, quarter, eighth, sixteenth notes, triplets, etc. If you've never programmed a drum before, start by copying drums from a song you like. It's the only way you'll get a good feel for it. A drumset is always at LEAST a bass/kick drum and a snare, then you have toms (which you can have anywhere between 1-6 of, I usually have 4) and various cymbals (hi-hat, 1-3 crashes, a ride, china, splash) learn the different sounds of each drum, and where to use them. \u000a\u000aIf you want, I can give you some real basic drum patterns later, but for now, I just got off work and must nap. hope this helps. if you want to hear some drums I programmed (but didn't mix, I left that to another engineer), listen to my deathcore at http://gravebornma.bandcamp.com or my electronic music at http://yearn.bandcamp.com

VI think you're playing too hard on the snare. I know with this kind of music it may seem like you have to play it like that, but don't. I'm not saying you have to be playing ghost notes or anything, but accenting your hits (like at 1:13) will make your playing sound much cleaner and give it more life.

p6623
aVSome of the best talent in Michigan born from the late Ares Letum, the latter of which was incredibly ahead of their time in the music scene. That being said, their lifestyle has destroyed any chance of them making good music. Cult mentality with an enormous ego and a ridiculous victim complex. My old band played 3 shows with them. One was shut down after their set because they destroyed/stole other band's equipment. The other two involved throwing things at the crowd, police intervention/arrests, and tear gas. Fucking shithead pricks that don't deserve any recognition past the fact that they were once talented musicians.

p6628
aVI do not like them. 
p6629
aVI'll say that I tried!  I think they have some really good songs.  "Fat Around the Heart" and "Kill them all" are just really solid, heavy jams.  The rest of their album was kind of boring.\u000a\u000aI think their lyrical content starts off as potent, then ends up being redundant.  It's refreshing that they kind of have something different to sing about, but I think they take the wrong angle.  Instead of lyrics about uplifting themselves and having a positive impact on the shitty city they came from, it's all about how they are part of the problem.\u000a\u000aReally solid production on their album though.  Josh Schroeder rips it up and captured a very raw and aggressive sound.\u000a\u000aIf they came around with another band I liked, I wouldn't skip their set, but they're not a group I'd go out of my way for.

I loved seeing TAIM with a longer set, and Fallujah was just fantastic\u000a\u000aOverall though, a few years back I saw Roger Waters preform The Wall, and was more than blown away. The show started kind of normal, but throughout the first half, they built up a gigantic wall across the stage and were projecting on it. By the start of the second half, the wall covered the stage completely and the band played behind the wall (with the exception of the guitarist who climbed up on top for the solo of Comfortably Numb). Then, at the end of The Trial, when "Tear Down The Wall" is chanted, they knocked the wall down and played Outside The Wall as an acoustic.\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/KU1fewp.jpg\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/Ojt8ReS.jpg\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/n0eJMQ6.jpg\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/D9N8rQd.jpg

aVThe best overall concert I've ever been to was Nine Inch Nails. Their lightshow and effects were absolutely unreal.
p6698
aVnot deathcore at all but holy shit pennywise is the best live
p6699
aVMan, fuck. I've seen a lot of great shows.\u000a\u000aI saw Veil of Maya, After the Burial, Misery Signals, Within the Ruins, Your Memorial play together on the Crush Em All II Tour.\u000a\u000aI saw Meshuggah and Between the Buried and Me on Meshuggah's 25th Anniversary Tour.\u000a\u000aI saw Conducting from the Grave, Molotov Solution, MyChildren MyBride, The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza, and Suicide Silence on the No Time to Bleed Tour.\u000a\u000aI saw Counterparts and the original Misery Signals lineup (with a surprise 7 Angels 7 Plagues mini-reunion with all of the original members, but also all three vocalists from across 7A7P's career, in MS and 7A7P's hometown) on the Malice X tour.\u000a\u000aI saw Rings of Saturn, Thy Art is Murder, Periphery, Animals as Leaders, The Dillinger Escape Plan, and Cattle Decapitation at Summer Slaughter 2013.\u000a\u000aI saw Attila, For the Fallen Dreams, The Crimson Armada and Chelsea Grin on some tour that I forgot the name of when I was in high school.\u000a\u000aI saw Within the Ruins, After the Burial, Glass Cloud, and The Contortionist my freshman year of college.\u000a\u000aI saw Veil of Maya, Volumes, and Upon a Burning Body on the tour they did where The Acacia Strain was headlining but dropped, but Volumes was underwhelming, and it was the absolute worst Veil of Maya show I have ever seen (I've seen them like 5 times, including before they released The Common Man's Collapse). I haven't seen them since, because Marc is getting sloppy, and lazy. Almost all of the leads were on a backing track, and he was pretty much just playing chugs the entire time, and kept drifting out of time (even though they were playing to a click). Also their setlist was pretty lame. All songs from Eclipse, except Unbreakable and It's Not Safe to Swim Today. UABB fucking killed it though.
p6700
aVVeil of Maya, The Contortionist, Glass Cloud, with local openers. Mostly because The Contortionist. It was after Jonathan left though, which bums me out, but they played Vessel and Oscillator and I lost my fucking mind.
p6701
aVFor deathcore, Summer Slaughter 2014. The deathcore bands playing were The Faceless, Thy Art Is Murder, Within the Ruins, Fallujah, and a couple of pretty good local bands. For my bast concert overall, It was a lineup of Periphery, The Contortionist, Intervals, and Toothgrinder. I had gotten a lesson from Matt Halpern before the show, and was front row during it.
p6702
aVMy favorite was probably the Upon A Burning Body, Thy Art Is Murder, As Blood Runs Black, The Color Morale (know Hope album cycle so it was good), Fit For An Autopsy, I Declare War, and Last 10 Seconds of Life. \u000a\u000aReally wild show. 
p6703
aVI have a couple. \u000a\u000aI saw Suicide Silence with The Faceless before they made planetary duality. Nile was also there but they were boring. Mitch had CRAZY stage presence. Made for a fun show. \u000a\u000aThe Acacia Strain at the St. Pete warped tour a couple years ago was fucking brutal. "I AM THE END OF THE WORLD." and then people die. You know, the usual! \u000a\u000aAnd then in December I'll be going to the Emmure, The Acacia Strain and Stray From The Path show in Tampa so that should top the list. 
p6704
aVI like Suicide Silence and The Faceless, but I'm kind of surprised to hear that Nile was boring. The Acacia Strain was great when I saw them a couple of years ago... I would definitely do it again.
p6705
aVYeah it's weird cause well.... I like Nile. But they were just a freaking drag live. I don't know why.

VThat was sick dude. Maybe it was just a fuzzy recording, but I think you could push for a little more clarity in your lows, otherwise that was great! \u000a\u000aI bet you'd kill 'The Dot' by I Declare War
p6709
aVI'm actually debating what cover I do next. I'm thinking Veil of Maya, but I'll gladly consider some IDW :)
p6710
aVThis dude is seriously right. You would destroy any IDW. Your voice is perfect for that. You'd do well with some Acacia Strain as well. Sick cover bro. 
p6711
aVnot bad, although your beard is excellent
p6712
aVSounds great dude! I was on another tab while listening to this in the background, completely forgot I was listening to a cover of the song haha. Reckon you could do Dimensions of Reality by Aegaeon for a future cover?
p6713
aVOooh, another great suggestion. I'll keep it in mind!
p6714
aVTight.  Who did the rest of the tracks?  The guitars are different from the original track.
p6715
aVThe instrumental (programmed drums/ rhythm guitar/ bass) was done by YouTuber 'SummitSoundStudios'. We couldn't find a clean way to remove the original vocal track so we borrowed his cover. The lead was done by my guitarist, as seen in the video.
p6716
aVNot fuckin' bad, man. I also listened to your band's EP, really love the crunchy (or whatever you call it) producing. Your clean vocals are tight too. Keep em' coming!

VUsually for the bands I listen to, they show up on the same day as their release date, but it took about a week for A Night In Texas' recent release to show up

aVWell the thing is, it is usually the label or the distributor that releases albums for the bands in different music streaming sources. Doing so takes usually about a week, if the band has a spotify account. But there is no certain time, honestly.
p6850
aVThe time it takes for an album to appear on Spotify really varies. Slipknot's 5th album was put on there the same night as the release, but I've seen other albums take in excess of a week to turn up. Sometimes the band or the label will release an official album stream prior to the actual release date, via Youtube, Soundcloud, Music Glue or another platform, which is usually the best way to listen to a new album on (or before) the CD release date.

p7015
aVHaha, never heard of these guys but am listening to them now and liking the sound. Thanks for the suggestion!
p7016
aVThey've courted some controversy lately, when they promoted their new album on Twitter by faking that their singer had been abducted.  The worst part of this is that there latest album isn't that great.  "Intermission" from their album The World is Ours has a solid drinking anthem in it.
p7017
aVThe World Is Ours is my favorite, Red. White. Green. Is amazing, I wanted to like the new album, but I couldn't. \u000a\u000aI was really let down. I didn't care about the stunt, I was worried then pissed for 8 seconds. The album just didn't hold up to the last two. 
p7018
aVI was really not impressed with the stunt, and it took me a while to actually pick up the new album, because I have enjoyed their previous work.  I just really couldn't dig it.  The songs just don't have the same spark as their other stuff.
p7019
aVCan confirm. "Intermission" is the drunkest i've been.

aVIt's got a lot to do with how hyper competitive and well supported our local scene is, as well as a symptom of Internet and YouTube accessibility.

aVProbably because drugs are so expensive there people have to do things like actually practice guitar to not be bored
p7128
aVNot sure if any of you remember this, but back in the day (only a few years ago), it was Montreal that was pumping out all the super tight bands. You had Despised Icon, Ion Dissonance, Beneath The Massacre, Camilla Rhodes, The Last Felony, 3 Mile Scream, Blind Witness, Blessed By A Broken Heart (EP/First album when they didn't have the glam side to them). They pumped out some of the best stuff for a long time.

p7150
aVThanks so much for this, replaying it like crazy
p7151
aVCool music, duuuuumb lyrics.
p7152
aVMeh, its subjective.
p7153
aVI know, I just think they are boring and shallow while trying to bank on the space angle to sound cool. Just another stickler for lyrics I guess. They have a super gnarly sound, I give them that. My favorite part being "DON'T FORGET WHERE YOU CAME FROM". and the breakdown that follows it. I haven't listened to much of their other stuff, maybe they have some variety in the lyrics of other tracks?
p7154
aVYeah man, wasn't trying to knock you at all. I kinda feel like they are lackluster as well. However, I'm pretty heavily into sci-fi stuff in general, so bands like Rings of Saturn, Aversions Crown, and the like really get my jimmies going. Their *Multidimensional* album in general I found to be quite raw, but quite a fulfilling listen. They play alot on the Djent side of things, but I'm also kinda into the extended range guitars and unpredictable rhythms. All in all, Lifeforms are bland lyrically, but I love the way the vocals fit into the rest of the music.

aVSame day as Revocation's Deathless. I'll listen to them both on the 14th; can't wait.
p7221
aVWow, this was off the tits.
p7222
aVThis is really something else! They totally outdid themselves this time.\u000a\u000aI like how they focused more on the melodic parts, which have always been my favorite thing about Rings of Saturn. The apeshit wanky parts are definitely still there, but they feel more tasteful and sound better than they did in the past.\u000a\u000a\u000aSeriously, I'm totally loving this.
p7223
aVI agree. *The* biggest reason I couldn't get into RoS in the past was because, while they had really nice melodies, 90% of each song was just chaos. I think this album has a perfect blend of melody and discordance and I really really like it.

Not midi or guitar pro.  Nice try though.\ufeff"

aVWhat did it say?

aVHe just mentioned that the whole album sounds like midi. Clearly making a joke about all the criticism the band gets for the guitar work

p7239
aVNot super similar but check out Soreption or Archspire. 
p7240
aVSoreption shreds
p7241
aVIt's the vocalist (or ex vocalist) of Infant Annihilator. You might wanna check them out.

p7244
aVI thought you were saying that Dan Watson is the vocalist of Rings of Saturn. Your comment above doesn't really make any sense 
p7245
aVOh yeah, damn, I messed up pretty bad. Read some place that Dan would make the vocals for this album, pretty much assumed it was done. Should have read the album's description.
p7246
aVThe drummer was in Infant Annihilator, not the vocalist.
p7247
aVThis album is a prime example of why I'm in love with this genre... The talent it takes to pull this shit off. Rings of Saturn along with other bands deserve a lot more attention
p7248
aVThis album is amazing, nearly every audio sliver within it is incredible.\u000a\u000aBut seriously, what the fuck were they thinking on the guitar intro on Lalassu Xul? That was awful. I don't know if it was a joke or what, but it wasn't funny enough. It actually made me want to skip that song. They don't have to do funny little gimmicky things anymore. They're legit.
p7249

aVIt's pretty unfortunate that they lost the Dingir vocalist (along with the rest of the band or something, idk, they can't keep the same people for more than 4 months lol), but I think the new guy is doing pretty well.
p7252
aVThis album is incredible. It reminds me of Arsonist Get All the Girls, but a lot more brutal. Sounds like a deathcore van halen.

An example of relatively early "djent":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuFmNZ09_Y8\u000a\u000aAnd the ones who brought djent into popularity: http://youtu.be/6J4Ye7nRT0s\u000a\u000aYou must remember that the term djent really only describes the guitar tone. A lot of djent bands incorporate off beat breakdowns and time signatures.\u000a\u000aThis is of course a pretty condense explanation, but I hope it gives you an idea of the different sounds through the years.

aVThis is a shitty answer on my part for not having the source but he said more or less that he didn't care so much about going as low as he can but more so about pronunciation and being able to hear what he screams.

p7312
aVHey mate, we don't actually like labeling metal. We like to think it's just metal... heavy music. It's all sick, breakdowns or no breakdowns.  There's too many sub genres floating around these days. Aliencore? Hahah. At the end of the day if we needed to label ourselves I guess we would be "deathcore" if we were compared to a band like fleshgod apocalypse or behemoth.

aVUnfortunately Hayden is in his silk cocoon right now so he is unable to reply. We agree, Hayden was outstanding in Harry Potter. Hayden has been allergic to sunlight since birth, so going in the sun has never been an option for gothboyvamplvrhvden. If he goes in sun his dick flies off.

aVSince your first EP and first album, the vocals have changed quite a lot. Any lessons you've learnt? How did you come to progress to be so good, basically?\u000a Also how did you come about having 3 guitarists? 
p7352
aVWe got three guitarists to try and replicate the album live. Chris plays a lot of lead parts throughout the songs and it allows us to make sure the rhythm section still sounds full. 
p7353
aVYou left out the vocal question :( how did you come into doing highs, since you never did them on the EP Or first album? Also what vocal warm ups do you do to withstand touring? 
p7354
aVI didn't sing on the ep haha\u000aMy highs have always been my strong point because of my older band. Deep vocals have been a new thing for me since I joined Aversions. For warm ups I use the zen of screaning/ Melissa cross warm ups :)

p7363
aVI've been a fan since the EP and have watched the band's rise and evolution\u000aYou guy's keep refining your sound better and better with every album.\u000aAt first I thought having 3 guitarists was silly, but when I saw you guys live having 3 guitarists and a very solid bass player makes some of the heaviest music I have ever heard live.\u000aHow did you guys start using kemper profiling amps live and what are the advantages and disadvantages?
p7364
aVWe decided to get the Kempers to make touring easier. They're great sounding amps and are really practical. They've got a realistic valve sound and have a built in power amp. 
p7365
aVI see you guys used your own PA monitors on stage but if you guys desired you could plug directly into the front of house right?
p7366
aVYeah man absolutely. We can just run the Kempers straight into the PA.  We use our own speakers for our on stage foldback. 
p7367
aVFirst and foremost, you guys are absolutely amazing. I've been listening to your music basically everyday since I first discovered you just over a year ago. I attribute all of my PR's in the gym to the menacing breakdowns and fierce lyrical content of Servitude and the singles released off Tyrant. Gives me shivers and gets me in the fucking zone. Seriously just such a huge fan, the images you portray with your music are beyond apocalyptic and mind blowing. Tyrant was everything I had hoped for and my hype level was reaching near insanity waiting for it. Excellent work bros and thank you.... Anyways, questions. 1) Where do you draw the majority of your influence from lyrically as well as musically?  2) Favourite sci-fi book/movie/series/video game? 3) Favourite band or artist? 4) What do you guys do for day jobs (if you have them) and to add on that question what other passions do you have next to music and if you weren't professional musicians what would you wish for a career? 5) Is kangaroo meat really as good as everyone tells me? .... Thank you for your time it means a lot. Hails from Northern BC, Canada!!! Winter is coming.

aVNo.3 favourite band or artists is a hard one im going to say Behemoth, fleshgod apocolypse, Aborted, The faceless. There is alot of amazing bands that are big influences to us all

aVGreat answer! Behemoth pretty much got me into more extreme music. I caught them in Vancouver with Watain a couple years ago and their live show was absolutely monstrous!! Been a HUGE fan of Michael Keene and the Faceless since Akheldama, the man fucking shreds. 
p7376
aV1) cheers for the props dude, a lot of my influence for lyrics came from a super wide variety of sci-fi films, video games and documentaries. The ideas and themes explored on the tyrant album can't really be nailed down to one specific source, they were born from the experiences of everything in my life, I developed different ideas and beliefs over time that don't necessarily correlate with any one source. The themes on the album are made up from things I believe to be real mixed with things that I'm afraid of.\u000a
p7377
aVThank you for the answer! There are so many passages that hit so hard, very dark and yet so poetic. Reminds me of my nightmares.

aVThanks mate! Yeah we can't wait to get over there. There's been word of heading over there for your spring. 
p7383
aVWhat are you doing for V Loud? 
p7384
aVDoing a takeover, spinning some of our favourite tracks and talking about the album, should be live in a few weeks
p7385
aVAre you guys going to tour in America, New York or New Jersey any time soon?? I really wanna see you guys live, BTW new album is sick!
p7386
aVSpring is the word homie, hopefully it goes ahead
p7387
aVIf you were to do a galactic tour, playing to crowds across different planets, then what 3 bands would you want to go on the tour with? Btw I had an awesome time seeing you guys with Thy art is murder and Heart of a coward in Hamburg :)
p7388
aVHey guys\u000a\u000a\u000aDo you have plans to tour smaller, lesser mapped places like South Africa? Would be mad to finally see a quality metal band! Otherwise how are you all enjoying life on tour? \u000a
p7389
aVHoly fuck how didn't I know this happened, dammed work. You guys are fucking amazing. Loved every song and album you've put out.
p7390
aVWhen I heard you guys for the first time, I aggressively ejaculated all over my room.... 
p7391
aVwhats your theory about aliens and humans on earth?\u000a
p7392
aVThey are here, among us.
p7393
aVdude, thats deep. does the guitarist miss signal at all? i was bummed they split up. coming to see you in melbs on sat
p7394
aVWill you guys come to Norway?!
p7395
aVAny chance of coming over to the NZ anytime soon?
p7396
aVThat would be sick, we have never really had an offer, what are the shows like?
p7397
aVI'm more into hardcore personally but i do check out the occasional deathcore gig, the gigs range a lot from everyone standing/siting noding their head, to some good moshing. \u000a\u000aI am 17, so I've been only to all ages gig but the best gigs mosh wise was die die die and desperate models who are neither heavy. While going to a pretty much metalcore gig nobody was doing anything but two hardcore dancers.\u000a\u000aif you know you got a good fan base here the gig would be sick otherwise you'd probably want to tour with someone who does have a good one. \u000a\u000aVenues are pretty cheap too, I'd say.\u000a\u000ait looks like at some bars
p7398
aVListened to that new As Blood Runs Black today and turned it off to listen to Tyrant instead. Meaty meaty. Now how much of those drums are fake, cause holy fuck. Also, met a Brisbane woman the other day and she was super noice. Represent.
p7399
aVThats sick man.\u000aThe drums are not fake we spent a good while recording them.
p7400
aVThat's awesome to hear. Love you guys' shit as well as the lot of Australian death metal.
p7401
aVAww come on. Didn't expect this to be that early, are you guys still online?
p7402
aVJust logged back in Brah. What's up
p7403
aVAwesome, glad I didn't miss this after all. So I find the alien-themed element a great idea and so far every song reflects and expresses that pretty well. My question is do you guys plan on keeping this element for the next releases?
p7404
aVDefinitely, it's a comfortable subject for us and we haven't said all we wanted to say.
p7405
aVThat's a pretty solid thing to hear. I really support the progress of a band over time, but the lyrical and the base concept is something I like to see stay unaffected. Plus it was about time more "aliens" appeared in the metal scene, looking forward to see you live in January.
p7406
aVNotice me please?
p7407
aVDo you miss the other local bands, such as "The Red Shore", or "Signal The Firing Squad"? (I assume that any of you guys listen to them)
p7408
aVIn the glass sentient at about 2:42 what noise is triggering with the kick that sounds like a hollow pulse rifle shot?
p7409
aVWhy did you choose the alien deathcore element as your main focus as opposed to other genres?
p7410
aVIt's something we are all interested in, a lot of bands are singing about Satan, or hatred, we just felt comfortable singing about what we like
p7411
aVBesides deathcore, what else do you guys listen to? \u000aWhat artists have you been/are influenced by? \u000aMade a subreddit for Helm a while ago, you guys wanna be moderators? r/helmband\u000aDo you like cheesecake? \u000a\u000aIn 1932 there was a war in WA, the Great Emu War.  A war with emus. Yes, a legit historical event. What are the chances that event will be mentioned in your next album? \u000a\u000a
p7412
aVLong live the warriors of the emu war. a really inspiring artist to us is Lorde. I think the fact that she is the leader of the kiwi army who fought alongside the emu army is very inspiring.  She is also a very good geologist.  Yayaya I am lorde. Yayaya.

p7426
aVI mean when you compare Emmure to someone like The Faceless or Veil of Maya it can get a little aggravating that Emmure is just as if not more popular and they obviously aren't as talented. That said I like Goodbye to the Gallows quite a bit, and Emmure was pretty fun to see live during that time. I was totally unaware that frankie is a douche or whatever, I just thought their music got worse after The Respect Issue.
p7427
aV&gt;I mean when you compare Emmure to someone like The Faceless or Veil of Maya it can get a little aggravating that Emmure is just as if not more popular and they obviously aren't as talented.\u000a\u000aBest analogy I can think of is this; I love steak... thick cut, dry-aged, expensive ass steak. It's really one of the finest culinary experiences IMO. You know what else I fucking love? Taco Bell. \u000a\u000aBoth are hugely popular. Sometimes you just gotta groove with a good ol' cheesy Gordita crunch, because it hits hard and fills a need inside you. Other times, you need that exquisitely dry-aged hunk of cow flesh with all it's complex notes and textures because you're a fucking sophisticated human and you can appreciate the artistry that went into preparing it for you. Neither devalues the other, and both fill their niche at different points in your life. 
p7428
aVThere is a talent to fitting the right vibe though.  If Emmure tried to get more technical it wouldn't fit their sound. So it's a bit harder to knock Emmure for that.  
p7429
aVThat's a good point, I did like their original vibe but IMO they didn't really expand on it or do anything fresh.
p7430
aVI think it's the kind of thing you can't really expand on. It's successful cause it's simplistic old school deathcore.  They've been mediocre and even good at some times,  but after deathcore took off and evolved between 08-10 there just wasn't much of a niche for them anymore.  
p7431
aVI saw Emmure live once. Frankie is such an awesome dude though, the whole douchebag thing is pretty much all an act, I saw him outside after the show and talked to him. He really is a down to earth dude and they've got love for their fans, so fuck the people that want to hate. Oh yeah, and Thy Art Is Murder and Volumes were really kickass that night too.
p7432
aVI saw volumes here in ohio. They put on a really good show. 
p7433
aVVolumes always puts on a good show. Saw them 2 years in a row on warped and then once on the mosh lives tour. They never disappoint.
p7434
aV[deleted]
p7435
aVThy art fucking slays
p7436
aVI saw them with whitechapel, and he was a massive cunt. Apparently Phil bozeman is usually a dick but he was much better than frankie
p7437
aVI love Emmure. One of my favorite bands. I don't understand people's desire to put them down, but I do agree with you. There's a lot of good music out there that can be shared.
p7438
aVKids go through school thinking they have to like a certain [anything] and it evolves from there. It's tough for people to go along thinking that they can only like a certain genre/band/etc. and then branch out, and it takes time. It's just a matter of growing up, I think.
p7439
aVI think the reason people don't like Emmure is because it's possible to play their guitar riffs on a [hockey stick.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF8psEdwVVo&amp;feature=youtu.be)
p7440
aVFor starters, I love Emmure, especially Goodbye to the Gallows. That being said, I also think that Emmure has some hilarious songs in terms of musicianship and I think Frankie Palmeri does have a propensity to be a douche sometimes. And I enjoy laughing at them while enjoying their music. \u000a\u000aI think the problem with music is everyone has an opinion they feel is fact as opposed to understanding that this is just their opinion. Shut the fuck up and listen, and have an opinion you can share, and if that opinion is a low level comment about how the singer jerks off to We Came as Romans or Falling In Reverse who cares; thanks for being a part of the scene because without fucktards like you, it would be boring (I'm using the universal fucktard not you per se). \u000a\u000aAnd a lot of people also have a really hard time approaching music with an open mind these days (unfortunately). But, it's what makes the scene the scene, and we have to admire it for that. You can take any genre whether it be pop, rock, classical etc and there will always be a village idiot. It's something that strikes more to the core of what people are generally like as people than genre or music taste. Some people are simply idiots who will hold onto their opinion until the church burns down, and they'll be in the church at the alter receiting their opinion while it burns, and you know what... fuck'em let'em burn. \u000a\u000aThis sub is about finding music that YOU like. Not that someone else likes or that someone else thinks is good. If your aesthetic fits the music you are listening too sweet! If it doesn't change it. \u000a\u000aThat being said, we are on Reddit. I think we should let the trolling, short sided and shallow comments continue! If the internet isn't pissing people off, the internet is not working properly. \u000a\u000aLONG LIVE THE SCENE \u005cnn/ (fucktards and all)
p7441
aVI'm going to simply explain the reason I don't like Emmure. 90% because of Frankies vocal style. To me, it sounds like he's pushing out a serious turd when he pushes his cleans really hard, that and I think his screams are amateur at best. The same goes to the rest of the band.I couldn't give two hot steeming dumps about who evers a douche and who ever is "a really down to earth dude." I just don't care for their music.\u000a\u000aOn the upside for Emmure, I saw them open once and they were entertaining to me but nothing more than that.

p7488
aVThe fact that TAS incorporates actual hardcore bands like Ringworm and Incendiary on their guest vocals and not bullshit like Jonathan Davis or Corey Taylor or some shit shows that they know their roots. The guest vocals give the song a great dynamic. Anyone who disagrees is obviously wrong and dumb. (downvotes ahoy!)

p7495
aVI think this song was better than that other single they released, but this is still shaping up to be a rather sub-par album. Maybe it's because I've grown older and changed, but I certainly haven't enjoyed the direction TAS have gone since Wormwood (which was the last good album if you ask me).

Not many people would have been so welcoming to a couple of teenagers. It wasn't even till later on that I realized how cool it was of him to do that. I have so much respect for him outside of him being one/the best frontmans that started the deathcore genre.

aVshocking to me as well\u000a\u000athat whole album from start to finish is one of my favorite of all time\u000a\u000athe last relapse will forever be my favorite ASP track of all time \u000a\u000asuch a dark subject covered with brilliant riffs and insane vocals, how can anyone who claims to enjoy metal ever hate that album 
p7585
aVI was a casual fan, until I saw them live.  Amazing set!  I recommend that if you have the chance, you check them out.
p7586
aVIve seen live videos, im just unimpressed
p7587
aVI've seen em live a few times. Every time it was honestly hit or miss. If the crowd wasn't feeling it eddie would get kinda pissy and start not giving a shit. I can honestly only think of one show where the planets aligned and the set was overthetop badass.
p7588
aVI saw them in a little show (maybe 100 - 200 people? ) where eddie had to be in front of the stage like with the crowd and was honestly one of the best shows ive been too
p7589
aVThis is what makes me jealous of people who live in Australia. I feel like there are a lot of venues there where the singer is in the the crowd. I've seen pictures with Thy Art is Murder, I Exalt, Tomb of Doom all in those situations. I remember local shows like this and there is a great energy. 
p7590
aVIMO. Eddie does have shitty stage presence. In ASP, he just stood there, hairy, belting shit out (top notch at that). In SS, he did the same thing. He jumped some on the bouncies, but that was it. \u000a\u000aI think this album will be disappointing if you are looking for a deathcore album. Though every fiber in my body hopes for the best.
p7591
aV&gt;he just stood there, hairy\u000a\u000aum... what
p7592
aVI saw them during their last tour. Eddie had grown his hair long + his face hair long. It looked like a shirt with a brown weeble on top. 
p7593
aVBen was the reason I loved so many songs and Eddie was a great vocalist for for them. I don't think they'll be the same without those two. 
p7594
aVLooking forward to the new music they'll drop. Hope it lives up to their older albums though.
p7595
aV[Francesco dropped a hint back in november](http://instagram.com/p/u_SHKRuwPA/). I can't wait for new content.
p7596
aVArtusato also has a solo instrudjental project. If you like Angel Vivaldi or Modern Day Babylon it's worth a listen.
p7597
aVYes Yes Yes!!!  Been a long time fan of this band for a long time.  Definitely was unhappy that Eddie left.  I hope they get one that brought the rage just as much as he did.  From that Nuclear Blast promo looks like a lot of good metal maybe coming out this year:  Enslaved, Immolation, Meshuggah, and Nile.
p7598
aVif Eddie is not the vocalist it is basically a totally different band\u000a\u000aI treat vocals as another insturment, and usually each vocalist is unique, the downside is that changing a vocalist can drastically change the way a band sounds overall\u000a\u000aI really, desperately, want Eddie to come back to ASP and keep putting out incredible music even if he is in SS and ASP simultaneously \u000a\u000aOne of the only regrets I can remember having was not going to see ASP when they played locally a couple years ago, I would absolutely relish the opportunity to see them live, all the better if Eddie was back with them so that their whole catalog was still playable

aVTheres always that guy when it comes to Emmure. But in all seriousness, with every album, they distance themselves from the genre further and further.

I kept listening to new shit hoping it'd eventually be a return to Goodbye to the Gallows.

asVThoughts on the new Emmure album?
p7637
(lp7638
VOk. I used to ride the "Emmure fucking sucks" train too. Sure, a couple of their songs were passable, but as a deathcore band I gave them zero respect. After seeing them this past week with the Acacia Strain (who were fucking incredible btw) I have to say, Emmure is definitely a HUGE guilty pleasure of mine. Their stage presence is great and Frankie is a decent ass frontman if you can put up with the "I think i'm a rapper" bullshit. They aren't meant to be taken completely seriously or do anything groundbreaking. They're just a bunch of angry white dudes who are just a bit more.... urban... than the average deathcore fan. But rant aside, I'd say it's a solid album, nothing spectacular.
p7639

aVI didn't even know they were touring together.  I still can't believe that given their beef all those years ago.  It just seems odd.
p7642
aVI didn't even know they were releasing a new album, like, I've literally heard nothing about it. How does that happen?\u000a\u000aThat being said, Emmure has never been something I listen to for lyrics, and I didn't really care for the last album. The last time I enjoyed an Emmure release was Felony, not sure what it is about that album, but its always fun to jam out to.
p7643
aVThat's because *Eternal Enemies* came out on April 15th. They toured just before its release with Thy Art Is Murder, Volumes, and Gideon. I never liked Emmure but I enjoyed their live performance on this tour. I decided I would check out their new album when it dropped and it only reminded me why I didn't like them to begin with. There is nothing to be excited about on that album.
p7644
aVThe song with the school shootings just annoyed me, it's just Frankie trying to be edgy and get people talking. He'll deny it and say that it's some artistic bullshit, but fuck him.

Before they were Your Heart Engraved, and before that Diminished. \u000a\u000aEDIT: Just wanted to post proof of the SM deal - [thats me](http://imgur.com/4HDNdnU) in the background of the Machine video from 2 summers ago.

Observer ties all the loose ends together just like I feel Acrania's "Disillusion In A Discordant System" did at the "Send them to the slaughterhouse".\u000a\u000aAll of the sounds and the feel of legitimate "doom" make this album great. The Acacia Strain just sent a gut punch to us all. \u000a\u000aThis is The Acacia Strain and this is what they do best. No technical guitar riffs, no complex time signatures that each guitarist and drummer plays to, just pure unadulterated hate.

This is gonna be a rough couple of days, but the positive comments on here have me beyond pumped.\u000a\u000aEdit: It finally came... Holy shit. So worth the wait. The album is excellent, but Observer just put it over the top, it's simultaneously one of the most beautiful and terrifying songs I've ever heard. 10/10, this is AOTY material for me.
p7700
aVI gave in... \u000a\u000aNo regret. But I understand them feels.
p7701
aVI don't blame you. Favorite track? How do you think it stands up to their other material?
p7702
aVWell it was rather hard for me to choose a favorite track, I'm stuck between Observer, Whale Shark, and Cauterizer as my favorites... \u000aAs far as their other material goes, I wanna say Wormwood had a baby with DITOM. Gut-bustinly heavy. :D
p7703
aVThe final song is its own album. Reminds me of Sleep's Dopesmoker right down to the effects they put on the opening riff. Really hoping they explore that more.\u000a\u000aOtherwise usual lovely stuff. If you like Acacia cause they are the most hateful, nihilistic, ethos-lacking band out there, this is more of the same. A little less continuous/proggy/spacey then DITOM (IMO their best album as a totality, maybe not their best songs) and not the skullpounding chugfest that was Wormwood, reminds me of Continents even the intro song has that drop and hit the ground running start. 
p7704
aVThat song with the dude from incendiary is so good. A whole album with him and Vincent would be incredible.\u000a\u000aI also really dig that 27 min song at the end. It reminds me of that of something Pig Destroyer might put out at the end of one of there albums.
p7705
aVDefinitely my favorite since Continent. Observer is super cool, too.
p7706
aVObserver is fucking epic!
p7707
aVI have been waiting with baited fucking breath for this album. The first track is like a kick in the god damn mouth. I'm thoroughly impressed with this album and I think it's a great marriage of their classic and modern sound (Dead Walk/Continent + Wormwood/DITOM).\u000a\u000aObserver is a monstrous and epic track that transcends everything the band has ever done previously.\u000a\u000aBury me in a nameless grave.
p7708
aVCorrect me if i'm wrong, but is that one of Matthew McConaughey's True Detective speeches in Observer?
p7709

aVI just received my pre-order today.  This album is fantastic.  Production wise, it reminds me of their "The Dead Walk"-era style Acacia.  However, listening to the songs themselves, and hearing "Continent/Wormwood"-era Acacia in the lyrics and song style.  I noticed they brought back some speed for it(except for Observer obviously, I don't care what anyone says, that sounds like it could be straight up sludge and it is awesome.).  The hate, the pessimism, the Apocalyptic themes are all there.  I like the return of the more raw sound on this one.  Definitely a damn good album.  Now, on to waiting for Rings of Saturn's new one.

aVIf you find this boring maybe it's because what you're used to listening to is more so techdeath than deathcore or hardcore so you're wanting cool guy time signature changes and shredding while this instead punches you in the face with another breakdown, which is what its meant to do.

aVDoes it really matter to you what genre a band decides to label themselves as? Do you NEED to call them deathcore? Do it anyway it's not like TAS are going to write an angry comment to you about it. What a trivial complaint to have against a band.

aVuhh ok. what does that have to do with the album being boring?

sVLooking for a suggestion
p7750
(lp7751
VI got your back dude, I've been on the hunt for deathcore bands with good clean vocals forever. Everyone always suggests Betraying The Martyrs and stuff like Emmure/Attila/all the rapcore but here are some bands that don't sacrifice a shred of brutality for those cleans:\u000a\u000aOvid's Withering: Not only are JJ's vocals as flawless as can be, his style is very traditional death/almost viking-metal-influenced, so it's really easy to get into them for people who aren't as into the heavier side of extreme vocals. Their bassist throws clean passages in on some songs here and there, and the dude's got a really nice voice. Perfectly suits the music, compliments the already-phenominal instrumentals, you can't go wrong. They're easily one of the best deathcore acts out there, and they throw down some wicked djenty madness too, so there's something for everyone.\u000a\u000aErra: They're not really deathcore - not even close really - but Erra's newest EP "Moments of Clarity" features a brand new vocalist who primarily uses a thick, deep growl that can honestly compete with some of the better deathcore screamers out there. They're really a djent-driven metalcore outfit if you want to get technical, but they can get pretty heavy with it too. The big thing here is the guitarist, Jesse Cash. Not only is his guitar work completely jaw-dropping at times, he delivers some of the best clean choruses in metalcore.\u000a\u000aAkeldama: Another prog/djent band, what a surprise. These guys rip some sick tunes, *if* you like stuff that's very technical with the time, but more ambient/graceful with the melodies. They can be a *little* bland at times, and the harsh vocals are *good* but nothing really to write home about. The highlight of this band is its founder: Andrew Zink. Dude is talented as fuck, and his clean singing is kind of ridiculous. I don't know if you ever wanted to hear a full-grown bearded man sing higher than Mariah Carey, but that's what you get with Akeldama. And while I'll admit, it's a rather abrasive sound to most at first listen, but you never know who might like what, so I'll suggest it to you as well.\u000a\u000aInto Infernus: Andrew Zink is back, and this time he brought Norway's shameful past with him. Into Infernus is a symphonic black metal/deathcore/"KVLT as FVCK" fusion band, and is definitely something to behold. There are three vocalists; one who does high, raspy black metal screams and screeches, one who does deathcore-style lows and gutterals, and Zink himself, who writes, composes, and records all of the instrumentals, co-writes the lyrical content, performs theatrical voices as narration throughout the songs, all of which tell stories influenced by Christian myths and biblical stories (with an emphasis on Satan and Satany-like things. It *is* black metal after all), and he does all the clean vocals throughout their newest album, "The End of Eden", and I have to say they're even more astounding than in Akeldama's songs.\u000a\u000aShadow Of The Colossus: all-around just a fantastic band. Amazing guitar work, excellent deathcore vocals, and solid cleans and metalcore screaming from the second vocalist. The percussion is otherworldly, the melodies are outstanding, and the breakdowns are beautiful and brutal at the same time.\u000a\u000aThey're... they're *brutiful...*\u000a\u000aAnd finally, Shokran: because Ancient Egyptian folk djentcore. Because why not.\u000a\u000aThat's all I can think of now, and I apologize for using my mobile so I can't provide any links, but I reckon these should be a good place to start. I tried to stick with bands you probably haven't heard too much of if you're relatively new to deathcore, so just let me know if any of these stand out to you, and I can suggest some other bands like them.

aVSame. Seems a little too tough guy core. Just trying to be as heavy as possible to look cool and knowing others will listen to it to feel tough as well. 
p7785
aVthat's beatdown for ya.\u000a\u000abut yeah, can't get into them either. I love music that's heavy as fuck, but them and other 'beatdown' metal is almost TOO ignorant for me. 
p7786
aVthere's beatdown done right, and then wrong. Traitors is too monotonous IMO. REX, Feign, Bodysnatcher do it right
p7787
aVAs I agree with you guys they are a little too heavy but I do like them cause the slow heavy breakdowns with the long screams and parts that hit hard as fuck just give me goosebumps. Feign, engrossed, body snatchers, black tongue all do it a bit better. 
p7788
aVIMO Traitors does it better than those. But that's my opinion.
p7789
aVI'll be honest, Black Tongue's first EP got me into beatdown/down-tempo, and then Traitors just kinda sealed the deal for me after that.

They knew his blood wasn´t red. \u000a\u000aThe Sun ejected him to the depths. He was forced to stay. \u000a\u000aAn equinox of despair darkened his poles. Ultraviolet violence corrupted it all in the galaxy. \u000a\u000aThe agony condensed on those protoplanets. The fatal consequences reflected in billions of years. \u000a\u000aSatellites, secret moons, lurking star rings. A massive conjunction of death. \u000a\u000aWhen planets collide, spiral arms grow, floating like stellar corpses, disturbing star formations. \u000a\u000aAnd darkness conquers space, expanding the obscurest density waves, arousing life light years away from us. \u000a\u000aWe all are from a small planet that orbits around a mediocre star, in the galaxy suburbs. \u000a\u000aIts collision will merge to form a giant elliptical force and at the end, that star will be left with none of the bodies that first were orbiting it\u000a\u000a---------------------------\u000a\u000aImpressive lyrics for what I think is a Spanish band

sVLooking for Graphic Designers
p7876
(lp7877
VI really hope you guys find someone suitable, cause your song that I just heard is fucking awesome. Although I wouldn't really classify it as deathcore, to be honest. While the guitar tones and percussion definitely speak to that of early-Despised Icon/newer-Whitchapel, the grooves and vocals are more reminiscient of metalcore, along the lines of Sworn In, Architects, Wolves, and Seditionist. Try cross-posting to /r/metalcore just in case, because they'll dig this shit and you might find what you're looking for there.\u000a\u000aBut deathcore fans, check this shit out. It rips, it grooves, and the vocals seem to have a really nice emotional emphasis to them. The first couple lines of Progress/Process are just absolutely captivating. Hope to see some more releases from you guys soon, and no matter what style it'll follow, you'd better be posting it here so I can find it.
p7878
aVWow, thanks man. this means a lot that you even gave us a listen. thanks for the feedback. I already made a post to r/metalcore at the same time as this one. I just thought there might be some people here that could help us with designs. 
p7879
aVThere ought to be. People have hooked up artists with bands on this sub before, and I guarantee as soon as someone takes the time out to listen to your stuff, they'll be pushing it just the same as I am. Feel free to post your song itself on the sub as well.
p7880
aVArchitects are hardcore son
p7881
aVI gave you a listen and it's awesome. You really remind me of Northlane sometimes. I can't help you much with graphic design, but depending on what you need I could try to do something. Just out of boredom. I can promise you that it won't turn out good, but at least you get something to choose from.
p7882
aVNorthlane was exactly the comparison I was looking for. It's like a heavier, more "raw" take on Northlane's prog-metal/core sound, especially as the vocals are so expressionate just like Adrian's were and Marcus' are now. Good catch.
p7883

aVMake Them Suffer, Lorna Shore, The Acacia Strain, and Rings Of Saturn all have have great lyrics.

VDude taps like Fred Astaire on LSD.
p7989
aVWould anyone mind explaining how the "tapping" works? I have never thought about it that much but I find it hard to believe that tapping the strings can produce those sounds
p7990
aVIt does.  Tapping on the string makes the string vibrate, thus the sound you hear when tapping.
p7991
aVIt's a bunch of Hammer on's and Pull off's mixed with tapping. Combining it all really fast in a sequence while executing it well results in that sound. \u000a\u000aEDIT: It really sounds way harder than it is to execute. If your a really accurate player you can pick it up in no time.
p7992
aValright, I guess I just don't know guitar very well 
p7993
aVCalluses. \u000a\u000aBig fucking calluses. You can't do it with soft pussy hands. \u000a\u000aYour fingers have to *bleed* from tapping, and only then can you get a good tone out of it. \u000a\u000aAlso, another important factor is in your string and tone choice. If you're going super bright nickel wound with 10-treble/0-mid/10-bass/10-distortion then you're not going to get a good tone for shit.\u000a\u000aBut like most things in guitar, it's all about practice. I can tap really well now, because my guitar's fretboard has seen more than its fair share of blood. \u000a\u000aI'm being over-dramatic, but that's essentially the idea behind it.
p7994
aVLeft handed and bad ass. My body is so ready for probing

aVDo we have any proof either way besides people's word as to whether or not Lucas did record at half-speed?

Its the kind of shit you hear being played by a smelly guy with a ponytail at guitar center, constantly looking over his shoulder to see if people are looking at him and his 666 sick shredz. Just because its complicated and fast, and yes, hard to play, doesnt mean it has any kind of musicality.

p8001
aVThanks, that means a lot! I think its coming together nicely as well.
p8002
aVThis is fucking awesome! I've always liked "blackened" bands. Keep it up!
p8003
aVThanks dude! Blackened is life \u005cm/
p8004
aVBlackened deathcore. Can;t say I've heard it before, but it's really cool. Any bands that inspired you to look towards that sound?
p8005
aVYeah man! As far as core music goes: Make Them Suffer, and new carnifex. Outside core: Goatwhore, Dimmu Borgir, Alghazanth, Abigail Williams, Enslavement Of Beauty, Cradle Of Filth. I love black/symphonic metal and deathcore, so combining the two makes perfect sense.
p8006
aVA better sound for the drums is the only thing that stands out to me as being necessary for improvement. A more organic-sounding, heavy kick would really help round out the -core elements and make it all flow nicer. \u000a\u000aIt's kind of touch-and-go with this sort of fusion, "blackcore" or whathaveyou, but as black metal has been my favourite subgenre since I was 9, and deathcore has become one of my favourites just in recent years, I'm glad to see someone's taking the reigns and actually making great music with this formula. \u000a\u000aGranted, you'll have bands like Into Infernus and Lorelei to compete with, but these samples definitely show a little more "expertise" when it comes to incorporating the black metal elements in, and the symphonic bits coupled with nice deathcore riffs are really pleasant to listen to. \u000a\u000aBut I think the vocals could honestly make or break this endeavor, so I hope your vocalist is capable enough to handle it. Fusing the extremity of deathcore vocals and black metal vocals is challenging enough as is, but also falls victim to the near-paradoxal standard that if it isn't amazing, it sucks beyond belief. From what I've heard off your bandcamp, your vocalist can do some good low growls and some wicked high screams, but he's gonna need to kick it into overdrive for this newer stuff.\u000a\u000aAnyway, just my feedback. I really like the sound you've got so far, and hope to hear more from you guys soon.
p8007
aVThanks for the feedback!\u000a\u000aAs far as drums go, I see what you're saying. I've worked probably more on the drum sound than anything else so far, I'm fairly happy with it, but as you said, the kick isn't fantastic. I'm still working on it, and hopefully it'll sound a bit better by release.\u000a\u000aVocals are very important to me, I've told our vocalist that he needs to step it up for this one, and he's been practising his ass off. If im not happy with the sound, i'll find someone else, I've already told him this and hes fine with it. I think he can do it though.\u000a\u000aThanks for being critical, it really helps to make this album better overall. Glad you are liking most of it so far though! \u005cm/

Unfortunately, I am not a huge straight downtempo (doomcore) fan, don't get me wrong sprinkled in with other stuff is awesome, but there is no way in hell doomcore is rock.
