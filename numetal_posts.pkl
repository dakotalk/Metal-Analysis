Let's respect others opinions (except in this round no one has any different opinions). \u000a\u000aUPDATE 2 POLL CLOSED: Something tells me old Fred isn't gonna make a come back so I'm gonna call it closed.

To be fair to him it's a fairly accurate statement. It's pretty much always the same Slipknot, SOAD and A7X songs. I need new music to listen to and after going through the various metal subreddits, this is the one with the most bands I like.\u000a\u000aSo tell me, what are the greatest songs/bands in this genre?

p243
sVWhat exactly is NuMetal? Sevendust is not one, are they?
p244
VRecently Sevendust has come up in my playlists and I'm finding a few songs are pretty solid, and I have arrived 15 years too late. But I read up on them and find they are classified as "NuMetal".\u000a\u000aI'm a fan of a lot of metal, whatever it's classified as "NuMetal" or whatever the hell, but I have a hard time grasping this classification. \u000a\u000aNuMetal to me has always been something like Limp Bizkit. Clear hybrid rock/rap (assuming that's the definition). Or Korn, I have a conflicted time thinking they are NuMetal since they are more like "groove metal" J Davis isn't exactly the rapper type like Fred Durst, but since they teamed up I guess they're in the same camp? Even people who say Faith No More was a precursor to NuMetal because Mike Patton "rapped" on Epic confuses me because FNM was not remotely NuMetal as a whole. It's like saying Led Leppelin was precursor to NIN.\u000a\u000aOr how people think STP/Smashing Pumpkins was "grunge" because they came out the same time as Nirvana, even though their music really wasn't grunge.\u000a\u000aTake, for example, this song - [Reconnect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A_sIDDzhzA)\u000a\u000aOr even one of the newest songs - [Picture Perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wDgSepBVHU)\u000a\u000aMaybe I'm just taking a small sample, but how is that "nu metal" exactly? What differentiates the muted guitar + bass drum + bass from something like, say, Meshuggah? (Of course they elaborate more on that, but still)\u000a\u000aI don't know, maybe I'm completely oblivious as to what "NuMetal" means. That or people are just blurring the lines between bands. I often see System of a Down as numetal, but I'm also confused by that one.

sVBracket Day 6: Fred Durst V.S. Mushroom Head Trio
p289
VAfter being discovered by KoRn, Fred Durst lead Limp Bizket into Stardom of the 90's. Not many artists affected people the way Fred Durst did. He took America by a Nookie storm with his catchy but also somewhat humorous songs that people just couldn't get enough of (well until the 2000's).\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpUYjpKg9KY\u000a\u000aWaylon Reavis Jason Popson and Jeffrey Hatrix and together they make up the Mushroom Head Trio Vocalists.  Mushroom head started in Cleveland Ohio in the 90's and has been followed by a loyal fan base over the years. Much like Slipknot, Mushroom head has many members and they all wear masks. However, Mushroom Heads combination of three different vocalists leaves a very unique sound that cant be replicated.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U45NfWSX-Vk\u000a\u000aUPDATE POLL CLOSED: FRED DURST WILL BE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ROUND.

The final scene had bees crawling over the lead singer.\u000a\u000aAny help in finding this song would be greatly appreciated.\u000a\u000aThanks

VChad Grey is best known in the new metal community for his work with Mudvayne. Mudvayne  was praised for their unique style and deep lyrical content along with the even mixture of different styles blended into one band. Chad Grey currently is working with the band Hellyeah putting out albums and touring, but many wish for his return to Mudvayne.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIqbdnaPcT8\u000a\u000aSonny Sandoval is the lead singer of P.O.D or Playable on Death. Sonny is Numetal through and through and holds the best quality of being able to right a song that has such a deep meaning that it often times leaves the listener in aw. Although the lyrics maybe insightful P.O.D and Sonny never lack on a catchy tune that gets caught in your head.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDKwCvD56kw\u000a\u000aUPDATE POLL CLOSED: CHAD GREY WILL BE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ROUND.

sVBracket Day 8: Chino Moreno (2) V.S. Sully Erna (3)
p544
VChino Moreno is the lead front man of the Deftones. His music often contains a eerie hypnotic tone that draws the listener in. The Deftones and Chino are often praised for there unique style and many people do not wish to admit that the Deftones are Numetal.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPpDyIJdasg\u000a\u000aSully Erna is the lead singer of Godsmack. Godsmack was formed in the late 90's and has grown to be one of the biggest Numetal and hard rock bands of current time. Sully is well liked for his impactful stage presence during live shows such as the bands live drum battles.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME3Ahe8z16k\u000a\u000aUPDATE POLL CLOSED: Chino Moreno is moving on to the next round.

VWhy do SO MANY people refuse to admit that these albums are nu metal? Honestly, these albums are practically the epitome of nu metal, and yet so many people will tell you that they were merely lumped in with the other nu metal bands of the time. I can understand the reason for doing so, as the term nu metal has sort of a stigma attached to it, but there is simply no denying that these two first albums fit the bill. Deftones don't get their own genre, they are nu metal.

p658
VI don't know how to really explain it more, but I have found several new Nu-Metal bands, thanks to the Japanense edition of Knotfest 2014 in Chiba. Just the fact that Slipknot could pull of an Japanese edition of their music festival last year shows that there is an up and coming Nu-Metal-movement in Japan, right now.\u000a\u000aTry out Man With A Mission, or go to http://knotfestjapan.com and explore the bands from there. One of the bands from the festival - Crystal Lake - made a cover of Limp Bizkit's Rollin': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WyZ2GcdmCM\u000a\u000aI can see definitly see one of those bands get big outside Japan later.

I'm skipping over the more unquestionable ones like KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Sevendust, etc. I'm trying to build this around the more aggressive-toned midstream and underground bands. So far I have:\u000a\u000a* Flaw\u000a* Unloco\u000a* 40 Below Summer\u000a* American Head Charge\u000a* Dry Kill Logic\u000a* Motograter\u000a* Five.Bolt.Main\u000a* Lifer\u000a* Bloodsimple\u000a* Apartment 26\u000a* Ill Nino\u000a* Stereomud\u000a* Slaves On Dope\u000a* grade 8\u000a* Switched\u000a* Nothingface\u000a* Endo\u000a* One Minute Silence\u000a* Ultraspank\u000a* 3rd Strike\u000a* Onesidezero\u000a* Noise Therapy\u000a* Another Black Day\u000a* The Union Underground\u000a* Coal Chamber\u000a* Lo-Pro\u000a* Five Pointe O\u000a* Systematic\u000a* Twisted Method\u000a* Epidemic\u000a* Nullset\u000a* Spineshank\u000a* Videodrone\u000a* Reveille\u000a* Boy Hits Car\u000a* Ra\u000a* Snot\u000a* Stuck Mojo\u000a* Factory 81\u000a* Cold \u000a* Nonpoint \u000a* Primer 55\u000a* Taproot\u000a* Soulfly and Sepultura (*Roots* album) \u000a* Smaxxide (suggested by natonio95)\u000a* Project 86, Travail and shuvel (suggested by disciple_walks)\u000a\u000aYes, I know, it's a long list already.

sVBracket Day 4: David Draiman (2) V.S. Wayne Static (3)
p1019
VDavid Draiman is the lead singer of Disturbed and most recently Device. He is widely recognized by fans and non-fans alike due to his unique animal growls that he often includes in songs. Although Disturbed is sometimes recognized as more of a hard rock band than Numetal, there is no denying the greatness of The Sickness.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVcY--XzeIc\u000a\u000aWayne Static is the lead singer for the band Static-X. Although Static X was popular in Numetal in the early 2000's there popularity faded over time and this unfortunately led to a break up of the band in recent years. However, not before they released a stream of popular hits.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps0MfBG5-Uo\u000a\u000aUPDATE POLL CLOSED: DAVID DRAIMAN WILL BE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ROUND.

sVBands with singers similar-sounding to Jonathan Davis?
p1026
VI really want to add some more Nu Metal to my library, but just about all music comes down to the singer for me.  Decent sounding instrumental performances aren't uncommon, but a great singer like Jonathan is rare.  So what are some other bands with singers who sound a bit like Jonathan?\u000a\u000aEdit:  Mudvayne seems pretty close.  They're not bad by any stretch.  Any others you recommend though?  I'm up for trying just about any band, but I don't like Slipknot.  I've got a fairly wide musical taste though, Skrillex, Infected Mushroom, Metallica, SYOAD, Korn, Disturbed, A7X, and now I'm probably going to be adding Mudvayne.
