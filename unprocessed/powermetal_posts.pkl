First off, **Crimson Wind** sounds like some solid symphonic power. It's pretty standard fare, but well executed. The vocalist is talented enough, and the symphonic elements are plentiful. If you enjoy symphonic power, give them a listen.\u000a\u000a**Evertale**'s *Of Dragons and Elves* was an unsigned debut release back in 2013, and now they are re-releasing via NoiseArt Records. And it is awesome. Fantasy-based, epic-vibe power metal right there. This is easily my favorite track this week... but it's an old one, so it doesn't count. I'm definitely gonna try and get my hands on this one, regardless.\u000a\u000aA lot of speed metal releases this week. My favorite of the bunch is **Enforcer**'s "Undying Evil", which is a true blast from the past. It's some impressive speed metal with a glam metal voice. I don't have much else to say, it's just some awesome old-school stuff.\u000a\u000aAnd finally, in the unclean vocals corner, **Exthenia**'s single is a masterpiece. That melodic intro just totally blew me away.\u000a\u000a##/u/MadTheMad:  \u000aI'm more than happy to recommend **Evil Invaders** plate of speed riffing and screeching accompanied with silly imagery and wording. The song takes us back in time to the thrashy 80s metal era and it's one speed baller of a song, it kicks off with the silly over the top intro (fits the image of the band) with wicked screaming vocals and evolves into a smashing and bashing force of nature. Everything is reminiscent of older times but at the same time feels like brand new polished metal; the band takes inspiration from stuff like early Metallica and Razor (The name of the band is the name of an album from Razor).\u000a\u000aI highly recommend Evil Invaders if you are into pure 80s speed/thrash worship with a modern touch, I know I will be getting the album as soon as I can. There's one thing I want to point out though and I'm not entirely positive of this but, it sounds like the drummer is not using a double bass... I know, jaw dropping right? A Speed Metal track with no frenetic pedaling these days is a very rare sight, just like the Bigfoot.\u000a\u000aLastly, nothing comes close to Evil Invaders this week but **Exthenia** stands out as something interesting, apocalyptic, deathly... Can't formulate words to express my feelings towards this song; it's a different (albeit generic in structure and pacing) eerie piece of melodeath and keyboarding insanity, worth a check most definitely.\u000a\u000a##/u/omegakingauldron:  \u000aA lot of the music here is good and worthwhile, with some standing out more than others. **Evertale** gets the highest of recommendations, being that it\u2019s what we all want; Power Metal, Fantasy and speed. The only problem I had was that it\u2019s a re-issue, but don\u2019t let that stop you from listening to it/picking it up.\u000a\u000aOtherwise, my recommendation of the week will go to **Enforcer**. This is mostly because I got that NWOBHM vibe from them, and I am always down for that sound. It even hit the main rule of music for me; if I\u2019m singing along to the chorus on the first listen, you are a worthwhile song/band (yes I know there was a lyric video, but I was actually not looking at it while listening).\u000a\u000aAnd since my colleagues mentioned it, **Exthenia** is an interesting case. I wasn\u2019t keen on the vocals at all, but I liked it instrumentally. It\u2019s worth a curious listen, but I don\u2019t see much value in it after that.\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a/u/MadTheMad: [MRW I get the high honor of recommending songs on the release week](http://i.imgur.com/jaC8kbk.png)

sVLooking for Suggestions - Power Metal With Backbone?
p76
VGreetings.\u000a\u000aPower metal is perhaps my favorite genre of music. While I am a fan of many genres, the sheer strength and energy of power metal has entranced me since I first listened to Dragonforce and Rhapsody in high school. I have gathered a few preferred bands over the years, but now I want to expand my horizons beyond casual listening.\u000a\u000aHowever, I have one big itch that few bands can scratch. Few of them have any depth to their music. Most songs don't escape vague epic fantasy platitudes. Dragonforce is the worst example of this, but I'd say it extends to most acts, even ones I love. Rhapsody of Fire's 10-album story, while ambitious, doesn't escape fantasy tropes. The lyrics lack weight for me - its the music itself that carries the song. The same can be said from what I've seen of Blind Guardian, Stratovarius, Nightwish, and most others. \u000a\u000aSo, what bands or albums break the power metal sterotypes? Which ones explore tougher emotions like fear and sadness, or tell unique stories? It'd be fine if some non-power metal bands/albums were listed, too, as I've been wanting to check those genres out (I've recently listened to Ayreon's The Human Equation and was very impressed). \u000a\u000aThanks for all the suggestions.

This is Valhalla, not the Senate. You can all take a bit of linguistic rough-and-tumble in the comments section. You're grownups. The freedom-driven frontier nature of this community is what gives it its character, and I am hugely unwilling to stomp all over that. Feel free to convince me otherwise but that's where I'm at right now.\u000a\u000aStay tuned to /r/PowerMetal in the run-up to the new year for the prep for our annual awards ceremony!\u000a\u000aRegards,\u000a\u000aSpeakMouthWords

V###Discovering Power Metal: Neonfly\u000aFellow warriors, today we will be looking at a band with a weird-ass name. Neonfly. Neon, fly. What? That must be the most un-metal band name I've ever heard. Don't be fooled, though. These guys can pull some serious tunes!\u000a\u000aI just had the last exam of my life. I've got nothing booked for next week, as I'm awaiting a thesis interview. What does that mean for you? Avantasia write-up before the end of next week! WOOOOO. AVANTASIAAAAA!\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###About the band  \u000a**Genre**: Melodic Power Metal  \u000a**Country**: UK\u000a\u000aAs the name might reveal, Neonfly isn't a heavy and dark band at all. Their most distinct characteristics are their solid melodic instrumentation and the glam-rock voice of their vocalist, Willy Norton. They debuted in 2008 with an EP, but didn't get a full album released before 2011. Just before the end of 2014, they released their second album, which was positively received by many of us here on /r/PowerMetal.\u000a\u000aWhile Neonfly is not a very guitar-oriented band, their music is still utilizing guitars to carry their songs along. It generally stays in the background, though, save for guitar solos in most of their songs. These guitar solos are usually nothing to write home about. However, the non-guitar instrumentation is very good, especially on their second album.\u000a\u000aInstrumentation aside, the voice... damn. The vocal style that Norton uses is usually found in glam rock bands. To combine it with power metal instrumentation feels incredibly fresh, and as an enthusiast of both genres, I can only say *hell yes*. Norton has a powerhouse of a voice. If he made music in the fourth quarter of the 20th century, he would no doubt stand as a beloved classic together with Freddie Mercury, Klaus Meine, and all those folks. Sadly though, Power Metal is a criminally underrated music genre, and even within the genre, Neonfly will probably stay under the radar. Well, this review is an effort to generate some well-deserved attention their way!\u000a\u000aLine-up:\u000a\u000a* **Paul Miller**: Bass guitarist  \u000a* **Frederick Thunder**: Guitarist  \u000a* **Patrick Harrington**: Guitarist  \u000a* **Boris le Gal**: Drums  \u000a* **Willy Norton**: Vocals\u000a\u000aGet familiarized with the band:\u000a\u000a* [A Gift to Remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AW_NzNarEc) - Music video  \u000a* [The Revenant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f04io8ERRm0) - Tour movie with studio audio  \u000a* [Better Angels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ngt3Z33m8U) - Acoustic version\u000a* [Heart of the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmiMP8zwyKs) - Playlist addition\u000a\u000aAnd here are some useful links:\u000a\u000a* [All my reviews](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2qlzcx/review_index_discovering_power_metal/)\u000a* [The glorious YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE1FmEyuepxioBu4yCDeqK8Ntfgly8oC1)\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Outshine the Sun (2011)  \u000aA very ambitious album name, and in terms of radiating energy and positivity, the album does the name justice. This album has a big hard rock influence, and while I can barely find any tracks *not* worth naming, I can only recommend listening to this album if you also enjoy regular hard rock and glam rock. Power Metal purists won't find what they're looking for here. If that doesn't scare you off, then by all means. It's a very solid debut album, the quality level is definitely high. Even so, I couldn't find an isolated track that is a must-listen. Hence the lack of a playlist addition from this album. Still wholeheartedly recommended! Let's dive in:\u000a\u000a* [Broken Wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iN6MwsdFSQ)  \u000a* [The Enemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3EBS4QZ1M8)  \u000a* [Ship with no Sails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGIWszVeUv0)  \u000a* [A Gift to Remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AW_NzNarEc)  \u000a* [The Revenant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f04io8ERRm0)  \u000a* [The Ornament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V12wWggTKg)  \u000a* [Reality Shift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD-7gVzlAkI)  \u000a* [Spitting Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g685N9fwDN4)  \u000a* [Morning Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpR_F-mVkjs)  \u000a* [The Messenger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOPbOHdFO1E)  \u000a* [I Think I Saw a UFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9emk9x4qJA)\u000a\u000aThe album doesn't suffer from a pointless intro, but kicks right off with a self-contained track. "Broken Wings" is quite catchy, nicely fast, and should tell you pretty much what to expect from this album. The next songs have a more melodic touch, as is immediately evident in the sweet intro guitar riff of "The Enemy". The song maintains a fast pace and has great vocals.  \u000a"Ship with no Sails" has starts off with a cool bass riff, then goes into a video game-like guitar riff. Pretty great stuff. In this song, the vocal style deviates a little bit from the glam rock style, as it sounds a little more like modern alternative rock. I personally like that less, but the chorus is so damn great that it more than makes up for it.  \u000a"A Gift to Remember" takes on a hard-rock vibe. As such, it is the first slower-paced song on the album. It's pretty catchy (noticing a trend), and the slow pace allows for the vocals to become a lot more prominent. They already were, of course, but this song really showcases what Norton can do. 1:30 - 1:45 is genuinely awesome in that respect.  \u000a"The Revenant" has a heavy and intense guitar intro, and it's awesome. Beyond that, it sounds very similar to the rest of the album. This song does have the coolest guitar solo of the album at around 2:45, so there's that.  \u000a"The Ornament" is an instrumental-only track. It's very cool, but ends up being less memorable because of that fact.  \u000a"Reality Shift" is very fast and a tad heavier than the rest. This is the song that sounds the most like a traditional power metal song. It's definitely headbangalicious, but it sounds a little bit unpolished vocals-wise. Still a very nice track. The last minute is a guitar solo segment, a really interesting way of finishing a song.  \u000a"Spitting Blood" goes back to having a classic hard rock vibe. The instrumentation isn't very interesting here, and the chorus is easily the most memorable part of the song. The guitar solo, while short-ish, is pretty cool as well.  \u000aThe next two songs are the only two that don't kick major ass. "Morning Star" has some oriental sounds in their intro, a little out of place but whatever. The instrumentation is okay, but the vocals are less merry and catchy, making me like this song a little less. "The Messenger" is a slow song, and suffers because of that fact. The vocals are good, but the song is too boring to keep my interest.  \u000aLuckily, the album has a great finish. "I Think I Saw a UFO", quite the wacky title, goes back to being a fast-paced hard rock-influenced song with great, catchy vocals. Like with "Ship with no Sails", the vocal style leans a little bit toward modern alternative rock. It's still cool, and definitely the quirkiest song on the album. The ending is wtf.\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Strangers in Paradise (2014)  \u000aStrangers in Paradise, while still having a noticeable hard rock vibe to it, this album feels a lot more like Power Metal. It's a lot more diverse than the first album, which can be refreshing on the one side, but on the other hand I might have wanted more songs like "Heart of the Sun". Let's dive in!\u000a\u000a* [Whispered Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYiCTRsoTuQ)  \u000a* [Highways to Nowhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFauncPjRow)  \u000a* [Better Angels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ngt3Z33m8U) (acoustic, only one I could find)  \u000a* Rose in Bloom (no vids)  \u000a* [Heart of the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmiMP8zwyKs)  \u000a* [Aztec Gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo4vHxWy8AQ)  \u000a* Fierce Battalions (no vids)  \u000a* [Sons of Liberty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGpkPYp1rR4)  \u000a* [Chasing the Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWFlfI-yHdQ) (uploaded this for you, sexy bastards)  \u000a* [Falling Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOG8NULIkr0)\u000a\u000a"Whispered Dreams" is a nice opening song. It sounds much like a song right off the debut album. You can notice, though, that the focus has shifted a little towards melodic sounds. The instrumental segment between 1:55 - 2:45 sees some nice guitar riffs and some melodic parts, pretty cool and full of energy. The vocals don't disappoint, either.  \u000aThe opening song is followed by a song that throws you a bit out of whack. The always-positive, happy sound of Neonfly suddenly changes dramatically in what I can only characterize as some sort of punk rock track. "Highways to Nowhere" has vocals that are harsher than normally, sometimes bordering on the unclean. As a punk rock song, the instrumentation is basically just noise. A very surprising song that I don't care for.  \u000aLuckily, though, this change is reverted again in the next track, "Better Angels". It's a slower-paced song with decent vocals and a pretty great chorus. "Rose in Bloom" is even calmer. It's a warm and fuzzy song, for those moments when you need some feel-good vibes to calm down instead of getting hopped up on fast power metal.  \u000aThen we get to Neonfly's ultimate song, **"Heart of the Sun"**. This song is absolutely awesome. It's their catchiest song. It's the song with the most prominent melodic vibe. And the vocals are fantastic. This song NEEDS to go down as a Power Metal legend. In five years, people should repost this song and go "remember this gem?" Because really, holy shit. It's not an intensely fast song, that's not what makes me go holy shit. It just bursts with energy, and it just doesn't stop. The melodic intro is delicious, and man, when those guitars and drums kick in, you know you're in for a treat. Then the vocals start, sounding great as always. At first it doesn't seem very different from other tracks, but somewhere down the line (chorus build-up, chorus), you realize this is their catchiest song. The instrumentation stays awesome, with melodic sounds throughout the whole song and kick-ass drums. After 2:50, the song suddenly enters a really awesome segment, in what must be the greatest musical bridge in power metal. *I don't want no last chance, bring it on, I'll advance and chase my, FREEDOOOM! FREEDOOOOOM!* Hence the holy shit.  \u000a"Aztec Gold" sounds a bit like a continuation of "Heart of the Sun". It's an all-instrumental track, seeing some nice guitars and even the return of the melodic segment so characteristic of "Heart of the Sun". It's pretty cool for what it is.  \u000aThen we get back to regular tracks with "Fierce Battalions". Decent melodic intro, after which we're thrown into one of their heavier tracks. The vocals are slightly rougher than usually, but not to the extent of "Highways to Nowhere". It's definitely a decent track, and the guitar solo is really short but really cool.  \u000a"Sons of Liberty" is another track that sounds like it could have been on the first album, at least in terms of vocals. The chorus is pretty catchy, and the instrumentation is all right. It pretty much follows the formula that Neonfly has established for themselves by now.  \u000a"Chasing the Night" is probably my second favorite song from these guys. A really great, catchy song. I absolutely dig the chorus buildup and the chorus itself. Not quite interesting enough instrumentation-wise to warrant a playlist addition though. The guitar solo is cool, though. It's more like... If I added this one to the playlist, then I'd have to add more songs too because they're about as great as this one. It'd all become a big mess. Does this make sense to you?  \u000aThe album finishes off with a feel-good song. "Falling Star" is a calm song, sounding like kind of a send-off, like something that would play during the ending of a movie. And while it SOUNDS like he's singing "*You're far away like a porn star, baby*", you can rest assured because he's saying "falling star", not "porn star". It's pretty sweet, tying the knot on a pretty unique album.\u000a*****  \u000a###Conclusion  \u000aNeonfly turned out to be quite awesome, right? Within the Power Metal genre, Neonfly has a pretty unique sound, with its hard-rock influences. Norton's glam-rock voice is easily the best feature of this band, although the instrumentation is very solid. The first album is a solid outing, being somewhere between a Power Metal album and a hard rock album. The second album leans more towards Power Metal, and is also more diverse. I dig both, but you might find yourself favoring one of the two.  \u000a\u000aWe're at the end of another of my walls of text. As I mentioned, **Avantasia** is next. Look forward to it! I might actually have to split it up in two parts because of the size of the discography and the awesomeness of the band (making me write more).\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a[Me when Neonfly pops up on shuffle](http://i.pinger.pl/pgr188/6300fb320001e8494dc0ea21/I+feel+good.gif)

VIs Axenstar\u2019s new album any more interesting and coherent than 2011\u2019s *Aftermath*?  Does it recapture any of their early day\u2019s magic from 2002\u2019s *Perpetual Twilight* or 2003\u2019s *Far from Heaven*?  Well, I don\u2019t know, decide for yourself!  This isn\u2019t a damn review, it\u2019s a track-by-track first impressions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a**Disclaimer:**  I am in no way a professional reviewer of music; I am just giving my first impressions as a power metal fanatic for those who are wondering if they should pick up the album.  Feel free to offer advice and tips on how to improve this for the future.  \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a**Disclaimer 2:**  This is FIRST IMPRESSIONS, and I have found myself to be very picky lately.  If you feel this kind of music is your thing and I do not like it, do not feel bound by one man's unprofessional and shitty opinions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a**1) Fear**\u000a\u000aThe intro to this song is energetic and it kicks your ass with some sweet, varied drumming and rhythm guitars.  Considering the intro and verse alone, this is a great start to the album.  The verse continues with this energy with a beautifully flowing vocal melody.  Right away you can notice the improvements in Magnus Winterwild\u2019s control of his voice, and it is quite nice.  The pre-chorus is the most awkward part of the song, coming in too early and completely disrupts the energy and flow of the song - the song takes a big hit because of it.  The chorus does not do a good job of saving it either.  It is hard to tell you have even made it to the chorus.  You can tell they put a decent amount of thought into the structure of the chorus, but it does not captivate, it does not stick in your head, and it does not bring the energy back from the beginning of the song.  The best word I can use to describe the chorus is awkward, though to be honest, it does have a hint of something that makes me think maybe I\u2019ll come back to it.  After the second chorus comes a riffing interlude which is a bit boring but serves its purpose as a transition into the guitar solo/more interlude.  This is probably the second best part of the song.  It is the only section that matches the introduction\u2019s energy.  The song then ends with its awkward chorus.\u000a\u000a\u000a**2) Inside the Maze**\u000a\u000aInsize the Maze starts with a very generic power metal intro - sounds nice, but is nothing special.  The verse is fairly catchy, and it really showcases the vocalist\u2019s new control with his voice.  The pre-chorus is good - nothing great, but leads up to the chorus nicely.  The chorus is still kind of awkward.  Maybe it his voice making the chorus\u2019 awkward?  I am not sure, I enjoy a lot of their older chorus\u2019.  That said, it is more fitting to the song than Fear\u2019s, but I am not sure if I would say it is better.  The bridge after the second chorus is alright, though it really showcases a lack of emotion in Magnus\u2019 voice.  The solo that follows is nice.  I like what they are doing with the solos so far - instead of throwing every note in that they, they try to create a melody and build a solo around said melody.  And they do it quite well.  The song ends off with a repeat of all the vocal sections in order, and then the chorus repeats again in a higher key.  I do not imagine coming back to this song - while there was no notable bad parts, there was nothing captivating enough to make me think \u201clet\u2019s go listen to Inside the Maze again!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a**3) My Sacrifice**\u000a\u000aThe style of the first several seconds of this song makes me think they got the idea from Helloween\u2019s \u201cMy Sacrifice\u201d.  In-fact, I am pretty sure they did, though they went with a less epic route.  After this little part comes some deliciously heavy riffing, and boy does it sound great.  The verse kicks in keeping the sweet energy flowing that the song has created, and damn is it a great verse - this is what I am talking about!  The rhythm of the song so far has been fairly diverse and interesting.  Then the chorus hits\u2026 ugh.  What used to be Axenstar\u2019s strongest writing point has seemed to become their weakest.  Which is a shame, because the chorus is usually the staple of a song - being the most repeated part of a song, and being the most notable in terms of melody and structure.  Again, awkward!  The energy is simply not there.  What a damn shame.  The solo is the least interesting of the album so far.  Ending with another chorus, this is definitely the most disappointing song of the album so far.  So much potential, fantastic writing, leading up to such a shitty chorus that feels like they just stopped caring about the song.\u000a\u000a\u000a**4) Curse of the Tyrant**\u000a\u000aJeez, this is definitely the heaviest material I have heard from Axenstar (the album in general, including this song).  And I like it.  They really know how to do heavy song-writing.  Fantastic introduction, with keyboards, guitars, and drums that help make the song\u2019s title feel very relevant.  The verse is nothing special, albeit fitting.  The pre-chorus has some of Magnus\u2019 most aggressive vocals, which is not saying much - still, it sounds awesome.  Then comes the best chorus of the album so far.  The irony here is the chorus does not come until after the second verse.  It is nothing amazing, but it is definitely decent and it fits with the rest of the song, which is a nice change.  The solos have definitely begun to lose their touch.  After the short solo is a bit of a guitar interlude that is trying to recapture the image of the song, but feels like it is missing something.  The song realizes that after several seconds and decides to reintroduce that atmosphere with keyboards and heavy guitars.  The song ends expectedly, going pre-chorus &gt; chorus &gt; chorus with key change.  Again, I do not see myself coming back to this song.  Despite being probably the best song so far, I still can\u2019t find any magic in this album that entrances me to come back.\u000a\u000a\u000a**5) The Return**\u000a\u000aBeen a lot to say about the first 4 songs, but this one not as much.  The introduction is boring, the verse is fairly catchy, the pre-chorus is decent, and the chorus is forgettable.  Some nice, atmospheric keyboards placed throughout this song, though.  Solo is forgettable, and the ending is like the rest from this album.\u000a\u000a\u000a**6) Demise**\u000a\u000aThe heaviness returns, which is unsurprising considering the title of the song.  I love the subtle use of well-placed, atmospheric keyboard pads throughout this album as they use it here.  It is disappointing nothing has really kept me interested.  The verse is fairly generic.  The song skips the pre-chorus all together, and the chorus that follows is the most boring and uninspired of the album to this point.  Whoa, what happened here?  It is almost as if they realized \u201cshit, hey guys, none of my vocals has any emotion throughout this album - how about we do this little part right here?\u201d  After the second chorus comes a fantastic aggressive part by Magnus.  Is that really him?  This is the best I have ever heard from him in all of Axenstar\u2019s discography.  This part really fits in with the heavy theme in this album.  The solo that follows is the best of the album as well.  Two great parts in a row - it is a shame that the rest of the song is so mediocre.  Dammit, Axenstar.  You need to put more care into each song and make sure each song flows properly.  The song fades out with some out of place generic heavy riffing that feels like its there just to say \u201chey, remember this song is heavy and we\u2019re heavy\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u000a**7) Annihilation**\u000a\u000aWithout a doubt the best introduction of the album so far.  The keyboards start it off with some sort of light bells, for lack of a better word, creating for what I feel is a twisted take on the atmosphere behind \u201cannihilation\u201d.  The keyboards continue while some of the best clean guitar I\u2019ve heard from Axenstar joins in, creating for some of the best instrumentals I have heard from Axenstar in this album yet.  This atmosphere abruptly stops and Axenstar\u2019s heavy instrumentals come galloping in, kicking off the verse instantly alongside the heavy power metal.  This part is pretty awesome as well, turning away from the twisted take on annihilation to the more fitting, heavy take on it.  The pre-chorus is empty and forgettable, but the chorus is pretty decent.  While it is nothing great, Magnus decides to show some emotion here with a slight yell to his voice.  The interlude after the second chorus is nothing worth nothing, although the solo that follows is pretty decent.  The guitar has a really nice sound here.  Then the song changes things up a bit.  They repeat the chorus, but instead of ending the song, the galloping drums return, the rhythm guitar goes silent, and the song focuses on the lead guitar and keyboards.  This is a nice change of pace from the standard strong structure, and it is a nice interlude at that.  Then the pre-chorus shows its face again, and then the chorus for a fourth time, ending the song very abruptly.  As much as the chorus comes back, I do not think I will be.  Which is sad, considering this is one of the better songs so far.  And we only have 4 more to go.\u000a\u000a\u000a**8) Greed**\u000a\u000aThis song slows things down quite a bit in comparison to the rest of the song, starting with generic heavy riffing.  The verse is also pretty heavy, and Magnus\u2019 shows off his newfound (somewhat) aggressive voice that actually contains some emotion - quite enjoyable.  The pre-chorus slows things down a bit more while Magnus\u2019 repeats the last words of the verse slowly.  The chorus then follows, as is standard, and this is definitely the best chorus of the album.  It is a throwback to old Axenstar for sure, with catchy melodies and harmonies.  The bridge after the second chorus is a good lead into the solo, and this solo is quite enjoyable.  They definitely put care into molding this one.  Following the solo is a heavy riffing interlude (lots of those), and then the song ends with repetition of the chorus.  I imagine myself coming back to this song, and it is definitely the best song of the album so far.  Still, it is nothing amazing, which is disappointing.  Axenstar was one of the first bands that got me into not-DragonForce power metal.\u000a\u000a\u000a**9) The Reaper**\u000a\u000aMmf, that riff; very refreshing for power metal, making for a fantastic introduction.  Good verse as well, with a bit of a march rhythm.  The lead guitar does the pre-chorus this time around, and the chorus is quite enjoyable as well.  After the second chorus is a heavy guitar interlude with some blast beats and heavy keyboards to boot.  The solo is beautiful and surprisingly relates to the song title the most out of all the parts of the song.  After the solo is another guitar interlude, focussing more on the lead instead of heavy rhythm guitars, and is a nice build-up to the ending chorus.  This is the new best song of the album, as every part is quite good.  Still - I will not call it fantastic!\u000a\u000a\u000a**10) This False Imagery**\u000a\u000aThis False Imagery puts things back to speed - literally.  Up comes the tempo, in comes the double bass, and the soaring keyboards.  The instrumentals are quite enjoyable here, with the keyboards creating the most of the atmosphere, as per usual.  The verse is pretty generic and boring.  The pre-chorus is pretty catchy, though.  The chorus is intricate and there is a lot to it in terms of rhythm and melody.  That said, it does not hook me, and it does not do a good job in making me want to come back.  After the second chorus comes some of the best instrumentals of this album.  The rhythm guitar fades out into some atmospheric - a key word in this album - clean guitars.  Lead guitars come in to amplify this atmosphere, as well as a very noticeable bass line and appropriate drumming.  The solo that follows is quite enjoyable, albeit short.  The solos continue to be a dominant force on this album.  The song ends with its very intricate chorus.  Even if it does not hook me, I can really appreciate the song-writing here.  Overall, I probably will listen to this song again.  I enjoyed that interlude far too much.\u000a\u000a\u000a**11) Sweet Farewell**\u000a\u000aThe last song on this album really slows things down.  The vocals start the verse fairly quickly, and it is quite the snooze.  The pre-chorus is a snooze, and so is the chorus.  The interlude after the second chorus is definitely the most enjoyable part.  Some brooding rhythm guitar and marching drums, with some atmospheric (there it is again) lead guitar.  If the rest of the song was this quality, then we might have something.  This interlude definitely drags on too long, though.  The solo is one of the weaker of this album, no sections of it really standing out.  The song ends kind of awkwardly with boring chugging and random lead guitar.  I am not sure if Axenstar has done a good song at this slow of a tempo, and I am not sure if they can.  Poor end to the album.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOverall, I am pretty disappointed, but I expected it from the single, and from their last album.  However, this is definitely a big step up.  They are trying to create a balance between modern heaviness and the catchy, atmospheric and flowery melodies of Sonata Arctica-like power metal.  They are almost there.  I am quite interested to see what their next album has to offer, if there will be one.\u000a

VI've never been much of a singer, but been a fan of power metal for years, even when I was the only person I knew who listened to it. After listening to it for some time I began to try to sing some of my favorite songs because I wanted to see if I could sing like they do. While I don't really like to sing in front of people I've started to really like singing just for myself and I've been told I'm good at it. I never would have started if it wasn't for power metal. Anyone else have a similar story?

VIt is that time again -- when we all gather together in glorious feastmaking and merriment and bestow upon our favorite bands honors for their pleasing of our ears. In many of these categories, our warriors battled it out in manners worthy of song. In others, the victors sent their competition to the Hall of the Slain in swift time. But enough of introductions, \u000a\u000a[It is time for the victors to reap their glory!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkD0MxNY_Bw#t=10s)\u000a\u000a\u000aWe start off our awards with **best song!** This was a fierce battle with many fan-favorite entrants. Some entered with pure catichess, others tried weird avant-garde narration, but we're really concerned with who won right now! Well, as it turns out this award is so prestigious that we ended up with the rare occurrence of two winners: **Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods** and **Sabaton - Night Witches!**\u000a\u000aBut as we all know, a good power metal song is usually accompanied by a thrilling solo. Who bewildered us the most with their guitarists on the spotlight? We have another tie for **best solo**! **Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods** and **Viathyn - Cynosure** share this award!\u000a\u000aThere's more to a song than guitars, though. So let's give our appreciation to those who fill our speakers and headphones with the **Best Non-guitar Instrumentation!** For the first time in this thread, we have a clear winner! Congratulations to **Alestorm and their Sunset on the Golden Age!**\u000a\u000aThere's one more thing to fill out a song, unless you're an instrumental band, and so we come to **best vocalist**! Indeed, power metal is a subgenre which tends to care a great deal about the one working the microphone. Who is the glorious warrior to gift us with a voice for the gods this year? **Hansi Kürsch** of Blind Guardian!\u000a\u000aHowever, most of us don't want our vocalists singing random non-sense - the words they sing can help us understand the motivations behind the music, enhance our appreciation of the sounds, or simply just entertain us on their own! And so it is time for **best lyrics!** This one was mostly a battle between love, folklore, and war -- and you guys chose war! **Sabaton - Heroes** wins this category!\u000a\u000aThe last big piece of what makes an album is its visual approach. My mother always said don't judge a book by its cover, but an album cover is often our first impression of what the music will be like. They aren't always accurate, but that doesn't mean these works of art can't be appreciated on their own. And so we now bestow our judgement for **best album cover!** A falcon, sea, moon, and fire make up the winner for this year -- **Falconer - Black Moon Rising!**\u000a\u000aNow let's not kid ourselves. Power metal, and metal in general, is a sausage-fest. So while those albums with fronted by women can often stand easily on their own moments, it's also nice to set aside an award where there's no question that they can share in the spotlight too. And so we now present **Best Female-Fronted Release,** which this year goes to **Ancient Bards and their A New Dawn Ending!**\u000a\u000aIt can also be tough for unsigned bands to shine too (though Keldian's Outbound won album of the year last year!) And so let us take a moment to appreciate those who are trying to break into this industry and make it big. This year's **Best Unsigned Release** goes to **Noble Beast** and their self-titled album!\u000a\u000aLet us sow glory with one more award before we get to what you're all waiting for! We here in power metal pride ourselves with such thing as glory, being epic, charisma, and being mighty. We also look to individuals to embody these ideals. We now crown our **Mightiest Warrior** for 2014! He is well known for his stage energy and putting his aviators on little kids -- congratulations to **Joakim Brodén** of Sabaton!\u000a\u000aAnd now...\u000a\u000a[**YOUR ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1De-OI8YG-M)\u000a\u000aMany duked it out with their guitars, drums, bass, vocals, diverse instrumentation, lyrics, album art, and songwriting. In the end several bands fought for rather large scraps while one winner emerged. You know them for their stage presence and camo outfits. You know them for their war-based lyrics. You know them for that deep voice, catchy tunes, and plentiful keyboard sound effects! One and all, the Album of the Year Two Thousand Fourteen:\u000a\u000a**Sabaton - Heroes!**\u000a\u000aBut we're not done yet! We have a couple more rewards to go still!\u000a\u000aFirst, this community would be nothing without its users. Yes you guys! You who submit links, contribute to discussions, recommend changes for the subreddit, give us weekly features, vote, and listen! And whilst this community would not be the same if a single one of you were not here, there are those who've contributed more than others, and this is our chance to recognize that. Our **Upsword Award for Best User** goes to **/u/UnlostHorizon!** Wait... he's not here anymore? Well... this is awkward...\u000a\u000aLastly, we must continue our now annual tradition of recognizing those who've had an impact on the subgenre and us all. These are people who can be felt throughout what power metal is today, who've inspired numerous artists, and who've put out one quality release after another, always contributing to the wealth of this art. Last year, we put Kai Hansen in the halls of immortality. This year we recognize **Hansi Kürsch** for the **Lifetime Achievement Award!!**\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, that is all we have for 2014.

This wasn't something we mods had planned on, so we had to come up with a solution on-the-go. Many of their fans voted simply for that band in the categories they were nominated for and left everything else alone. We felt that this wasn't playing in the spirit of the subreddit, and so those votes were rendered void. All other votes were left alone. This choice was made while voting was still in its prime, and without take a close look at the current results. That is, we did not make the decision to play favorites. As things turned out, this decision only affected one category - it would have been a sole Viathyn victory for best solo.\u000a\u000aThis Awards Ceremony brought to you by [Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPTz7z04_OM), which was listened to several times whilst being composed!\u000a

p196
V###Discovering Power Metal: Dragonland  \u000aDearly beloved, we are gathered here today to listen to some **DRAGONLAND**.\u000a\u000aOnce again I dare venture upon sacred land, the Land of Dragons of the Sidebar continent. I, a heathen and a pagan adventurer, shall embark on a treacherous journey through this land, bringing back any *treasure* I can find.\u000a\u000a[The glorious YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE1FmEyuepxioBu4yCDeqK8Ntfgly8oC1)  \u000a[Review index](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2qlzcx/review_index_discovering_power_metal/)    \u000a*****  \u000a###About the band  \u000a**Genre**: Power Metal (often called symphonic power, but come on)  \u000a**Country**: Sweden\u000a\u000aDragonland is a power metal band that is perhaps best distinguished by their great vocalist Jonas Heidgert, and by their sound that, while staying relatively close to the basic power metal recipe, simultaneously manages to sound entirely different from other bands. It's difficult to put the finger on exactly what it is that defines Dragonland as a band. If I had to narrow it down to one thing, I'd have to say that their *songwriting* is what sets them apart.\u000a\u000aSporting five albums, Dragonland has an established name in the power metal scene. After some years of hiatus, they appear to be back to doing (a few) live shows, and there were apparently re-releases of their two oldest albums put out this month. Can't find much info on that, though. I'd be more interested in a *new* album.\u000a\u000aThree of their albums are based on *The Dragonland Chronicles*, a work of fiction created by the band itself. Essentially, these three are all related *concept albums*. I haven't delved into the actual story, and I'd go ahead and assume that it's nothing too deep. The first two albums and the fifth album are the ones that tell the tales of Dragonland. The third album doesn't seem to have a lyrical theme, and the fourth album is about *space*. All in all, I think we're in for a very varied and interesting experience!  \u000a******  \u000a###The Battle of the Ivory Plains (2001)  \u000a2001 marks the debut of Dragonland, with the first concept album to deal with the Dragonland Chronicles. The album starts off with the mandatory instrumental intro, which could easily have been a movie or video game soundtrack. Then the album really kicks off with [Storming Across Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3pNHqCqdkY). The first 25 seconds are brilliant, with kickass guitars and a good ol' high-pitched power metal scream. This segment gave me high hopes for this album, but the rest of the song didn't quite live up to its bombastic intro. The vocals are kinda monotone, making the song a dull overall. *A Last Farewell* is a ballad and a duet featuring a female guest vocalist. It's nothing special, and honestly quite boring imo. [Ride for Glory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPqTjxNuNX4) has some really cool instrumental segments, and is arguably the best song on the album. The chorus is actually pretty good, here. The title track has an interesting intro, but as with *Storming Across Heaven*, the vocals are pretty lackluster. *Rondo Alla Turca* is a short rendition of a piece of classical music. While it is generally well done, I think it would have sounded better if it was slowed down just a bit. [A Secret Unveiled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4DCKkYZuYc) is another okay song with pretty nice guitar segments.\u000a\u000aTo sum this album up, it's just not really that good. *Ride for Glory* is my favorite from this album, but even so, this isn't an album that I will personally go back and listen to. The sound quality is decent for a debut album, so check out the linked songs and determine if it is worth your time.  \u000a*****  \u000a###Holy War (2002)  \u000aAlready one year later, the *Dragonland Chronicles* saga continues. Also this album starts with an instrumental intro. It's pretty neat, could easily be a LotR soundtrack or something. The first normal track is *Majesty of the Mithril Mountains*, which is somewhat a weak kickoff. Except for the solo segments, the guitars and drums are pretty repetitive. Moreover, there is barely any semblance of vocal variation. [Through Elven Woods and Dwarven Mines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgY4reWfU_w) kicks it up a notch with pretty cool keyboard and guitar throughout the song, though still with uninspired vocals. The [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXgK3bKP2s0) is probably the song with the best vocals on this album, and it's pretty good instrumentally, too, with a nearly 2 minute long solo segment. Then we *Return to the Ivory Plains*, but there's nothing to see (or hear). [A Thousand Points of Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLpfJuie-7k) is a decent finisher for the album, not counting the 4 and a half minute outro.\u000a\u000aThe conclusion for this album is the same as the first one: Meh. There are a few tracks worth checking out for those who REALLY love their later albums, but it's nowhere as good. The title track and *A Thousand Points of Light* are the most notable tracks, but the rest is skippable.  \u000a*****  \u000a###Starfall (2004)  \u000aWith this album, Dragonland begun getting really good at what they're doing. It departs from the fantasy theme and instead takes on a variety of lyrical themes. It's a consistently good album with 8 standalone tracks and a three-part thingamajig called *The Book of Shadows* at the end. Despite this consistency, I couldn't find any single track that I feel deserve a special mention (and hence a playlist addition). This album is definitely a step up from the earlier two albums on the instrumental side, adding a lot more focus on (electronic) keyboard sounds. However, I feel that the vocal part did not improve to the same extent. I know this is the favorite album for some of you, and while I'd probably pick one of the next two albums, I can definitely appreciate Starfall for its consistent quality level. First, I want to get *The Book of Shadows* out of the way. Let's not beat around the bush - it's a weak finish of this album. Part 1 is a random instrumental part, part 2 has slow vocals that aren't as good as the rest of the album, and part 3 is another instrumental that admittedly is quite mysterious and interesting. As for the actually notable tracks, I'd say the rest are all notable. Perhaps with the exception of *The Returning*. [As Madness Took Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oncmbjuu7yY) is a decent album starter with a nifty electronic intro and a catchy chorus. The [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI9IJpR-jzA) has a catchy intro, decent vocals, a cool guitar hook at the end of the first chorus, and a cool solo segment. [Calling my Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJYGJL7zXA) has some of the best vocals on this album, though the chorus is somewhat underwhelming. [In Perfect Harmony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkNIBKZmpWc) has a pretty sweet intro and kind of an aloof vibe to it. That should be enough to get you familiarized with this album.  \u000a*****  \u000a###Astronomy (2006)  \u000aAs the album name reveals, we be talkin' bout space yo. The album starter is called **Supernova** ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeeTDGHiF3E)) and is the first Dragonland song I can *really* get behind. It encapsulates much of what I like about power metal. The intro (after 26 seconds, that is) is wonderfully cheerful and catchy. A major improvement on this album that is immediately evident is that the instruments and vocals are much, much more *congruent*. The instruments actually *carry* the voice up and make it more impactful. The vocals themselves are excellent, also a step up from earlier albums. It is also immediately clear that this album is a lot heavier than its predecessors, with pretty heavy bass and drums. Whether or not that is an improvement over *Starfall* is really a matter of opinion, mine being yes. *The Book of Shadows* returns with part 4, *yayness*. It's a random, stupid instrumental track. Also this album ends with a three-part thingamajig (stop it Dragonland), which is just as uninteresting as it was on *Starfall*. Other than that, this album is pretty good. The [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwf6VhhOAHg) is pretty damn good, with awesome vocals but lacking the intensity of *Supernova*, imo. [Contact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbbzPPOsUKY), [Antimatter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtDC9yyGfNQ) and [Beethoven's Nightmare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTShSv-95uI) are other noteworthy tracks.  \u000a*****  \u000a###Under the Grey Banner (2011)  \u000aThe final album of Dragonland makes a return to the *Dragonland Chronicles*. Whoop de doo. That aside, this is one of Dragonland's finest albums. In proper *Dragonland Chronciles* style, there is a mandatory instrumental intro that you can skip, yay. Even the second track, [Shadow of the Mithril Mountains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QseCih9H40) takes a minute to start up. After that it's a decent album kick-off. The quality level quickly rises with [The Tempest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6anQjgYeOnQ), which is a slow track with very intense vocals, giving the song a epic and motivating vibe. The guitar solo segment is nothing short of epicly intense. I love these slow guitar solos brimming with emotion, too bad it's a little short. Great track. Then we come to **A Thousand Towers White** ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp-cmldfErY)), which is easily Dragonland's best track. What can I say? It's fast and bombastic, with quick drums and nifty bass guitars accentuating the song. The vocals are ex-ce-llent! [Fire and Brimstone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jOn2CRDVw0) is all right, but I find the narrator voice kinda distracting from the overall quality of the song. The [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtGW8kDomxs) is decent, but it is 8 minutes long and I find myself bored towards the end. The album ends with an inconsequential outro, unless you've got the Japanese bonus track edition. This bonus track is called [At the Inn of Éamon Bayle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zZva8IiTSw) and is actually pretty good. The other albums had some bonus tracks as well, but none were worth noting. Anyway, this song sounds a little folky, and is among the best tracks on the album along with *The Tempest* and *A Thousand Towers White*.  \u000a*****  \u000a###Conclusion  \u000aPlaylist additions:\u000a\u000a* **Supernova** ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeeTDGHiF3E))\u000a* **A Thousand Towers White** ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp-cmldfErY))\u000a\u000a**TL;DR**: Dragonland is a unique band and is pretty good. Their best work is scattered across their latest three albums, whereas the first two albums are not really worth your time. *Starfall* introduces a focus on keyboard sounds, making the album very different from its two predecessors. The album is consistently good, with the exception of the three-part ending. *Astronomy* improves upon the *Starfall* sound, adding a focus on heavy guitars and drums. **Supernova** is a really great track from this album, with a cheerful intro and an intense, powerful sound throughout. *Under the Grey Banner* goes back to the Dragonland lore, for better or worse, and is a bit of an up-and-down album. **A Thousand Towers White** is my personal favorite track from this album and this band altogether.\u000a\u000aIt's difficult to pick a favorite album. All three of the latest albums suffer from useless intros, interludes, and/or outros, and/or multi-part snoozefests. The good stuff is scattered around these nuisances, but Dragonland has a lot to offer if you know where to look. I would pick *Astronomy* as my favorite album.\u000a\u000aThe next band I will be reviewing is **Divine Ascension**. *Pythia* and *Secret Sphere* are high up on the waiting list, *Elvenking* and *Sabaton* after that, and in between I might throw in some of the big names like Avantasia, Sonata Arctica, Rhapsody of Fire, and who knows, I might finally give Blind Guardian a try some time.

sVDiscovering Power Metal: Divine Ascension
p199
V###Discovering Power Metal: Divine Ascension  \u000aToday I'll be walking you through the discography of **Divine Ascension**, which has recently caught the attention of many with their surprisingly solid album *Liberator*.\u000a\u000aThings aren't going as quickly as I'd like. As a non-finance student taking a finance class for those last required credits, most of my time is spent with my face buried in textbooks to try to understand the madness. FML. But what can ya do. Here's my next review, for your reading pleasure.\u000a\u000a[The glorious YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE1FmEyuepxioBu4yCDeqK8Ntfgly8oC1)  \u000a[Review Index](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2qlzcx/review_index_discovering_power_metal/)\u000a*****  \u000a###About the band  \u000a**Genre**: Progressive Power Metal  \u000a**Country**: Australia\u000a\u000a**Divine Ascension** is a *female-fronted* progressive PM band. They have been active since 2007, which was when they debuted with a demo, and has since brought out two albums. Their latest album was released just a while back, and I caught them in the weekly release thread and instantly became a fan.\u000a\u000aLine-up:\u000a\u000a* **Luke Wenczel** - Drummer  \u000a* **Karl Szulik** - Lead guitarist  \u000a* **Robert Inglis** - Rhytm guitarist  \u000a* **Jennifer Borg** - Vocalist  \u000a* **David van Pelt** - Keyboardist  \u000a* **Jason Meracis** - Bass guitarist  \u000a\u000aDivine Ascension is the first and only band in frontwoman Jennifer Borg's musical career. The same counts for all other members as well, with the exception of Jason Meracis who has also played for the melodeath band *Unknown Addiction*. Any fan of Power Metal is bound to come across multiple of the female-fronted symphonic bands who opt for high-register soprano-style singing. Now, Divine Ascension is not a symphonic band, but I still find the fact that Jennifer Borg sings in a lower register extremely refreshing. Her singing style is somehow a little more down-to-earth and believable. She has shown an incredibly growth as a singer between the two albums.\u000a\u000aFamiliarize yourself with the band:\u000a\u000a* [Red Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PjP-hckyPs) - Excellent example of Jennifer's vocal quality - uploaded by yours truly.  \u000a* [Answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyY7icbJYro) - Their only music video, if you wanna see how they look like. **Note: Terrible song**.  \u000a* [Stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7_frbp6bi8) - Playlist addition #1  \u000a* [Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWqHmZFLQ3U) - Playlist addition #2\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###As the Truth Appears (2011)  \u000aThe debut album of Divine Ascension is, in a word, forgettable. I could go on to describe the tracks in length, or I could just tell you to go listen to *Liberator* instead. I'm leaning more towards the latter. Hell, I'll just list the three songs that I found to be worth listening to at all:\u000a\u000a* [Visionary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th4T8iFTzyQ)  \u000a* [Vision Divine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwjgucxpxl8)  \u000a* [One Last Caress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM-NeQlWHMU) - Most likely to best track on this album. \u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Liberator (2014)  \u000aLiberator constitutes a major improvement over the debut album in just about every possible way. Better vocals, better drums, better guitars, more prominent keyboards, and a heavier sound. \u000a\u000a[Dawn Brings no Mercy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKYFdoyU6Ao) is the opening track, with a pretty sweet intro. It's immediately apparent that this album is way more melodic, a welcome improvement. The vocals are sounding pretty good, but beyond the first couple of lines, I don't really find them very interesting. The saving grace of this particular song is the solid instrumentation. The solo segment at about 4:40 in is amazing. It begins with a wicked keyboard solo, moves over to a guitar solo, then switches back to keyboard, and then one last time to guitar. The keyboard parts are pretty damn cool!\u000a\u000a**Stronger** ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7_frbp6bi8)) is the first of two playlist additions from this band, and also my favorite of the two. This song is amazing, it totally blows me away. Everything about this song is fantastic. The *entire* song maintains a constant rhythm of one second between the heaviest drum beats, or the highest pitch of the vocal lines, or the most prominent notes of the solo, depending on where you're at in the song. The only exception is in the beginning of the verses, where there are no instruments to accentuate the vocals. I don't know much about composing music, but I don't believe I'm mistaken if I say that's pretty amazing. The instrumentation is nothing short of solid, starting off with some soft keyboard followed by a heavy riff and a combination of keyboards and guitars. The verses are pretty amazing, but what puts this song above the rest of their songs and honestly above most songs in general, is the bridge to the chorus and the chorus itself. The instruments accentuate the vocals perfectly. The guitar solo is amazing as well, starting at around 3:45. The song's got a dramatic vibe to it, not really the most common thing that the power metal crowd is interested in, but I love it!\u000a\u000a*Liberator*, the title track, is not really among the most impressive songs on the album. Honestly, it kinda sounds like a pop song (which is not a compliment). The vocals are fine, but apart from the keyboard and guitar solos, the instruments do little to remind you that this is actually power metal. That leads us to the sole reason for listening to this track: the keyboard solo! Starting at around 2:55. I couldn't find a video of this one, but check it out if it ever pops up, if only for the keyboard solo.\u000a\u000a**Machine** ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWqHmZFLQ3U)) is the second playlist addition. The intro is delicious, sounding like it could have been Symphony X. The vocals are great, and I like the lyrical theme (the "common age" of society - we should all be the same and we don't have to think for ourselves because society does that for us). The chorus will catch you off guard and blow your mind, because there's a moment of silence between the end of the verse and the beginning of the chorus. The chorus is a lot more bombastic, and has a different pace than the rest of the song. Very cool! There's a guitar solo at about 4:15, but it's nothing major. Another really strong song, though!\u000a\u000a[Red Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PjP-hckyPs) is a slow and calm song focusing on the vocals. As I said earlier, this song is probably the one that best shows off Jennifer's vocals. They are mainly backed up by piano and synthesizer. If you don't care about non-heavy tracks, feel free to skip this one. I'm generally not into non-heavy tracks either, but I *really* like this one for some reason. It sounds very peaceful despite being about death, and the vocals are just fantastic. "Oh what a waste, to leave this place that I call home". Chills. I had to upload this song myself... It's not playlist-worthy because it's just not power metal, but for what it is, attention is definitely deserved.\u000a\u000a[The Final Stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhyrPx3Dv8) is another quite pop-y song. The vocals are good, though, and the chorus is pretty catchy. Also here, the instrumentation is a little bland. But hey, it's not a bad song by any means. Also, it was the only other song that has been uploaded to YouTube, so it's got that going for it.\u000a\u000a*Hideaway* is the last song I'll mention. This one isn't up on YouTube either, though. It's yet another song that leans a little towards the pop side, but it's heavy enough. The vocals are pretty good, although the chorus isn't as good as the verses. Just another song to check out if it ever pops up.\u000a\u000a**NOTE**: The whole album is available on YouTube, but only for people living in the US. It's another upload by "Topic", which hates us Europeans and all other non-Americans. But if you are American, you can listen to the whole thing.\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Conclusion\u000a\u000a**TL;DR**: *As the Truth Appears* is forgettable, *Liberator* is awesome.\u000a\u000aSo I ended up mainly talking about their second album. And really, that's where it's at. I can wholeheartedly recommend *Liberator*. Even if you like that album, I wouldn't recommend the debut album, though. "Stronger" has become one of my favorite songs, and "Machine" is pretty awesome as well. I'm probably this sub's biggest fan of this album, but I hope all of you will give it a listen and maybe become half as hooked as me!\u000a\u000aThe next band I'm reviewing is **Neonfly**. I had promised other bands, but "Heart of the Sun" is on my head and I want to check out the whole discography (2 albums, I think). Luckily I'm my own boss. I promised to check out Falconer and I will, just not very soon. I'm also a little afraid I won't like it half as much as most of you do, so I'm giving myself some time to get into the band. Other upcoming bands are Secret Sphere, Pythia, Elvenking, Avantasia and Sabaton, in no particular order.

sVA guide for my journey into PowerMetal
p239
VHey everyone, \u000a\u000aFirst, thanks to everyone that contributes to this sub. \u000a\u000aI enjoy the complexity of some classical music. A few months back I saw [this nearly scientific headline](http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/metal-science/science-proves-metal-fans-and-classical-fans-are-identical-personality-wise) and thought I could be missing out on a whole genre of music. I talked to a friend of mine that's into metal about where I might find bands or songs that hit the things I like. \u000a\u000aSure enough, after some discussion, experimentation and planning my route on [a map](http://mapofmetal.com/#/home) I landed on power metal. Not surprising to anyone here and I'm honestly really glad to have this whole new world before me. \u000a\u000aHowever, I'm at a plateau and I think I need some guidance in order to ascend to another level. I have a list of maybe 10 or so songs I think are amazing and really do have a rich depth to them, and I'm wondering what else I might be missing. \u000a\u000aWhat (as best I can tell) I'm looking for is the real masterpieces of melodic power metal. Or maybe not - I have no idea. One place I won't compromise is vocals - harsh vocals just do not do it for me, it just reminds me of people doing a Christian Bale Batman impression. \u000a\u000aHere's a few examples of what I know I do like and I am aware of so far - my tastes are strange, I don't seek forgiveness for that. \u000a\u000aDragonForce: Cry Thunder, Through the Fire and the Flames, The Fire Still Burns\u000a\u000aNightwish: I Wish I Had an Angel, Nemo\u000a\u000aPathfinder: Fifth Element\u000a\u000aBlind Guardian: Battlefield, Mirror Mirror\u000a\u000aRhapsody: Lord of Thunder\u000a\u000aAngra: Carry On\u000a\u000aThere's a few others - I can't remember which Helloween song fell into this category, but they have one I think. \u000a\u000aWhat's strange to me is that for most of these songs they rarely show up in the "most popular" categories of the bands that made them. Many of those bands are prolific as well, so I might otherwise have to weed through hours of albums to find something similar. \u000a\u000aI appreciate in advance any suggestions! \u000a\u000aEDIT: To clarify - I'm looking for individual songs that are similar to the ones noted above. I've picked through a fair number of albums on the sidebar previously and since I've found a few things I like a lot - but it's like 1% of what I've listened to so far. I'm hoping to increase that ratio.

VSometimes people talk about power metal articles on wikipedia. Sometimes they say funny stuff. Here is a small collection of such moments, though it's not terribly expansive so dig around and post your own discoveries!\u000a\u000aIt's amazing how funny people can get over genre disputes...\u000a\u000a**Blind Guardian**\u000a&gt;I personally believe that Blind Guardian is somewhat Christian-Metal because on most of their albums, they have at least one, if not more songs about The Bible or Jesus. If you have any conflicting beliefs, please tell me them.\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000a&gt;[On A Night at the Opera's title] Sorry but copying the name of another album is....lame. \u000a\u000a**Helloween**\u000a&gt;[On the contentious point of the band being labeled 'power metal'] According to their website they play 'German Melodic-Speed-Metal', and really, shouldn't the article reflect the band?\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000a&gt;[On Keeper of the Seven Keys Part I] Have someone of authors of the article listened to the album if they had have, the would have realized, that the album is NOT Power Metal, but more mixture of Heavy and Speed Metal.\u000a\u000a**Sonata Arctica**\u000a&gt;Ecliptica rated 2 stars ?? what the heck? i have recknoning night and its nice but it isnt better then this one by any means so why is this 2 stars and that one almost 5 stars\u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000a&gt;most of Sonata Arcticas songs break the mold of power metal, they don't sound at all like Edguy or HammerFall which are pretty generic ... It would just seem to be incorrect to say that this is totally the same genre as DragonForce or Edguy. \u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000a&gt;This is definitely a progressive album, almost to the point where you could call it "pop metal".\u000a\u000a**Gamma Ray**\u000a&gt;"Helloween lost its continuity and did not develop to its full potential.

sVUnlostHorizon's Year in Review 2014
p288
VWell, I did a Top 20 list last year (that I apparently never posted here on /r/PowerMetal), and this year I was asked to make a Top 30 list by The Metal Observer, the site I write reviews and articles for. I'm not gonna bore you guys with 30 paragraphs of fawning over each album on this list. Besides, I'm gonna exclude 10 of the albums that I don't think are close enough to "power metal". I'll still mention the non-power metal albums and their positions, but I'll only write summaries for my top 10 power metal albums (leaving 10 power metal albums that won't get write-ups). Later on this month, I'll publish my Top 30 list in full detail on The Metal Observer and I'll link to it once it's posted, in case any of you care at all. \u000a\u000aI was worried my list would be too obscure and pretentious, but it's actually not that bad in hindsight. It definitely felt like a better year than 2013, and there's still stuff I feel like I haven't digested well enough yet. So I've got some quick Honorable Mentions that didn't make the list just because I don't feel like I have a good enough grip on the album yet. Let's get to it:\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a**Honorable Mentions**\u000a\u000a**Viathyn** - [*Cynosure*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDL26Jl-Vt4)  \u000a**A Sound of Thunder** - [*The Lesser Key of Solomon*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetRJ9aAyvc)  \u000a**Nothgard** - [*Age of Pandora*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDKfKotvEZ4)  \u000a**Skyliner** - [*Outsiders*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9SOCeLI9vY)  \u000a**Stilverlight** - [*Stilverlight*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=453EIo8DVKk)\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a**Top 10 Non-Power Metal Albums (and their placement in the Top 30 list)**\u000a\u000a30\u005c. **Primalfrost** - [*Prosperous Visions*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99dsIMoVqng) (Blackened Power/Folk Metal)  \u000a28. **Game Over** - [*Burst into the Quiet*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mpR7d0jPr4) (Thrash Metal)  \u000a27. **Heidra** - [*Awaiting Dawn*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlptzyGIzqQ) (Folk/Viking Metal)  \u000a26. **Delain** - [*The Human Contradiction*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubi1m5pR3hM) (Melodic/Symphonic Metal)  \u000a17. **Equilibrium** - [*Erdentempel*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPNOIK_kBx4) (Epic Viking/Folk Metal)  \u000a11. **Exmortus** - [*Slave to the Sword*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA2CnEfzTLw) (Technical Melodic Thrash/Death Metal)  \u000a8. **BABYMETAL** - [*BABYMETAL*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDqaTXqCN-Q) (J-Pop/Metal)  \u000a7. **Scar Symmetry** - [*The Singularity (Phase I: Neohumanity)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8aS37GpjdY) (Melodic Death Metal)  \u000a2. **Insomnium** - [*Shadows of the Dying Sun*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1S4_hGiti8) (Melodic Death Metal)  \u000a1. **Ne Obliviscaris** - [*Citadel*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z9PKxt_9k4) (Extreme Progressive Metal)\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a**Top Three Power Metal Songs of 2014**\u000a\u000a3\u005c. **Triosphere** - "Remedy" (No YouTube links found)  \u000a2. **Kamijo** - "[Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg_DOt-xyig)"  \u000a1. **Immortal Guardian** - "[Beyond the Skies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsWN_qJTRJA)"\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a**Top 20 Power Metal Albums of 2014**\u000a\u000a20\u005c. **Galneryus** - [*Vetelgyus*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KN3ju3xPmo)  \u000a19. **Magistina Saga** - [*Creaith*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzy4jcbd05E)  \u000a18. **Xandria** - [*Sacrificium*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGTAmmTiD_Y)  \u000a17. **Arion** - [*Last of Us*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg_-nEZFS-I)  \u000a16. **Ancient Bards** - [*A New Dawn Ending*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxnlx_TgRpI)  \u000a15. **Evergrey** - [*Hymns for the Broken*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmmh69G-pt0)  \u000a14. **Diabulus in Musica** - [*Argia*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzPESD5GGig)  \u000a13. **Crimson Shadows** - [*Kings Among Men*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJh7fSr0cRc)  \u000a12. **Twilight Force** - [*Tales of Ancient Prophecies*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6IVA0BdbnE)  \u000a11. **Aldious** - [*Dazed and Delight*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NY7S7b7PO8)\u000a\u000a10\u005c. **Kamijo** - [*Heart*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg_DOt-xyig): Easily the best JPM album of 2014. The symphonic passages are absolutely incredible, and anyone who can appreciate Kamijo's voice is sure to enjoy *Heart*. There's a wide variety of styles present on the album, and variety is exactly what I've been wanting from Japan for a while now. If you're a fan of Japanese power metal, Versailles, or you just want something a little different than most Europower bands, this is your best bet for the year.\u000a\u000a9\u005c. **MindMaze** - [*Back from the Edge*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC-GsMPLsgg): This is an improvement over *Mask of Lies* in every way. MindMaze may be female-fronted, but their style is much more akin to Queensrÿche or Seven Kingdoms. Sarah Teet's voice is absolutely incredible throughout, and some of Jeff's solos are so well-composed that they'll grab your attention before you know it. Also, Mike LePond from Symphony X plays bass here, so that's cool too.\u000a\u000a8\u005c. **Epica** - [*The Quantum Enigma*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7IIYIFljZM): The folks over at /r/SymphonicMetal are buzzing like crazy about this album, and with good reason. It's aggressive, driven, and it's on-par with the band's early material. I think everyone knows what Epica are capable of if they've heard even a fraction of their discography; this album is pretty much a cumulation of all their strengths and none of their weaknesses.\u000a\u000a7\u005c. **Ninth Circle** - [*Legions of the Brave*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89MQSGUKjrA): I really wish more people would have listened to this album. It flew under everyone's radar, and I only heard it because I had to review it. It's ended up as my top USPM album and top independent album of the year. *Legions of the Brave* is a bit different than most USPM albums. They have a fair bit of influence from the European bands, as well as an incredible knack for writing catchy choruses. Riffs-galore on this album, and it's an album that you should all give a try.\u000a\u000a6\u005c. **Black Fate** - [*Between Visions &amp; Lies*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEbDO9k1XVI): If you miss Roy Khan, this album is the cure for that. Vasilis Georgiou is a dead ringer for Roy Khan, and the music sounds very similar to Ghost Opera-era Kamelot. Even without the Kamelot comparison, it's an incredibly solid and consistent album with some great hooks and riffs. It's a good break from all the fantasy-themed stuff, and it's a great album in its own right.\u000a\u000a5\u005c. **DragonForce** - [*Maximum Overload*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7F3SU5BRw): I'm sure everyone's formed their own opinion on this by now. Frankly, I liked it just as much as *The Power Within*. Marc seems to be finding his place in the band quite comfortably, and that feeling on the last album that some of the songs weren't written for him is no longer an issue. \u000a\u000a4\u005c. **Vanishing Point** - [*Distant is the Sun*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od7PPU4kMVQ): Australia's finest export puts out another amazing album. With a melancholic and energetic sound, it's recommended for fans of Sonata Arctica and Kamelot. Some of the album borders more towards progressive metal, but it's done well enough to be captivating and keep your attention. \u000a\u000a3\u005c. **Sonata Arctica** - [*Pariah's Child*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxdHhemkLKo): The band's kicking butt again, and after the shockingly terrible nightmare that was *Stones Grow Her Name*, I'm happy that I'm no longer ashamed to be a Sonata Arctica fan again. The replay value on this album is surprisingly high, and there's quite an eclectic mix of styles and influences on *Pariah's Child*. If you gave up on Sonata Arctica over the past two or three albums, this is the one you'll want to listen to.\u000a\u000a2\u005c. **Triosphere** - [*The Heart of the Matter*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0): This is even better than 2010's *The Road Less Travelled*, and that's a difficult feat to achieve. There are a lot of *feels* to be had on this album. If you've never listened to Triosphere before, they're pretty much the equivalent of a keyboard-less Symphony X with a female singer. Having only been released about a month ago, this is one album I expect most power metal fans to have on their top albums list in some capacity. \u000a\u000a1\u005c. **Outloud** - [*Let's Get Serious*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkCEaUkfOM0): My #1 power metal album of 2014 was by Outloud, a Greek hard rock/power metal band, featuring Bob Katsionis of Firewind on guitar and keyboards. Considering Katsionis has written many of Firewind's most iconic and memorable songs since *Allegiance*, that should give you a good idea as to what to expect from Outloud. The songs are infectiously catchy, they're earnest, and they're exactly how hard rock and power metal need to be melded flawlessly. There's not a single weak song on this album, and I dare someone to listen to this album and not have a single chorus stuck in their head.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aI hope that was worth something to you guys. Comments are appreciated; the more aggressive and belittling, the better. Don't be afraid to really tear into me for not having Sabaton, Freedom Call, or Noble Beast. \u000a\u000a[Here's to an end of a year, and the promises of the beginning of another great year...or something like that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EfhAFA2yFE)

The preview song is solid to say the least, and it's a great breath of fresh air from the heaps of Europower that's being released right now. Speaking of Europe, though, if you haven't already done so, check out that **Serious Black** album. For some reason it's not on the Metal Archives (someone go fix that), but it's a supergroup with some serious starpower. Their album is fantastic to say the least. The track I've linked to reminds me quite a bit of Firewind and Masterplan, so if you like those bands, this is definitely worth your time.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a[Me everytime BABYMETAL gets posted to this sub.](http://i.imgur.com/4sCtgB4.jpg)

VI am getting ready to preorder Endless Forms Most Beautiful; the 3-CD edition interests me, but I am unable to figure out what exactly an "earbook" is (besides a special CD packaging that is the size of a record) or why it is so expensive compared to the 2-CD digipak. Does anyone know what the point of an earbook is?

V[Link to the original article](http://www.metal-observer.com/3.o/a-beginners-guide-to-the-world-of-japanese-power-metal/). I'm formatting it and posting it here for those of you who never saw it, as well as for the wiki's sake. Just keep in mind I wrote this about a year ago; some of the info might be slightly out of date.\u000a\u000aIt can be bizarre. It can also be off-putting. But it\u2019s an entirely new realm of the sub-genre that can afford some great new bands and masterpieces to listeners. The power metal scene has really blossomed since the arrival of X Japan in the \u201980s, and since then it\u2019s been taken to new heights and limits.\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve found myself getting dragged deeper and deeper into Japan\u2019s power metal scene over the past year, and I can honestly say that its best attribute is its daringness. As Marty Friedman put it so well, \u201cIn Japan, taboos are off\u201d. While so many people believe power metal is stagnant in the western hemisphere (which I disagree with, anyway), Japan has been experimenting all along with different sounds, interesting visuals, and pushing the boundaries of the genre, all while maintaining a flavor of the European power metal and speed metal that we all love.\u000a\u000aThe biggest distinction one could find about Japan\u2019s power metal is two simple words: visual kei. In its simplest definition, it\u2019s Japan\u2019s interpretation of glam metal\u2019s visual element and fashion trends. Musically, however, it can vary anywhere from pop music to melodic death metal and metalcore. While some bands nowadays denounce the self-indulgence of visual kei, Japanese power metal undeniably traces its roots back to the innovators of visual kei: X Japan. Several bands continue the visual kei trend to this day, but most have moved on with slightly less focus to their imagery.\u000a\u000aAnother important aspect is most bands\u2019 insistence on singing in their native language. Several bands do incorporate the occasional English lyrics into their music or entire English songs, but almost no bands have dedicated their music entirely to the English language. Unfortunately, some of the English pronunciation can be poor at times, but much like Europe\u2019s questionable grasp on the English language, it can lend itself to become an endearing element of the music.\u000a\u000aSo to help introduce people to the world of Japanese power metal, I thought I\u2019d highlight several noteworthy bands, in my opinion, give them a rundown, and list some important songs of theirs. I\u2019ll be dividing this list into two portions: male-fronted and female-fronted.\u000a\u000a#Male-fronted\u000a\u000a##[**X Japan**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/X_promo.jpg)\u000a\u000aAs innovators of visual kei and power metal in Japan, X Japan is without a doubt the most vital band to the development of all sub-genres of metal in Japan. Having achieved mainstream success with *Blue Blood* and shattering records with *Jealousy*, as well as having constructed a 30 minute masterpiece, *Art of Life*, it\u2019s easy to see why they are held in such a high regard. Following their disband, guitarist, hide, took his life, and it took until 2007 for all the side projects to subside and the band to reunite, but not without paying homage to their late guitarist by dedicating their new song, \u201cI.V.\u201d to his memory.\u000a\u000aFan-favorite tracks:  \u000a* "[Kurenai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6lKT8REALw)"  \u000a* "[Art of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eqmkgSeYjI)"  \u000a* "[Endless Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LyJ20WWsAU)"\u000a\u000a##[**Galneryus**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/GalneryusAngelofSalvationalbumphoto.jpeg)\u000a\u000aAs one of the most well-known Japanese metal bands of the current millennium, Galneryus have popularized their own brand of neoclassically-tinged power metal in the past decade. Having been kickstarted by Japanese metal veterans, Syu and Yama-B, the band has since undergone numerous lineup changes with songwriter and guitarist, Syu, being the only constant. Their most recent release, *Angel of Salvation*, has seen them receive worldwide acclaim from critics and fans alike heavily in part to the majestic orchestrations and solos employed. In contrast to X Japan, Galneryus has been relatively free of visual kei imagery and outfits and are easily the most famous power metal band to achieve their level of success without the visual kei connection.\u000a\u000aFan-favorite tracks:  \u000a* "[Angel of Salvation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsi9HEmZl9Y)"  \u000a* "[Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hL-iO86vdI)"  \u000a* "[Hunting For Your Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FhmyWT-_0U)"\u000a\u000a##[**Versailles**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/22101-versailles-ftsv.jpg)\u000a\u000aWith lavish Baroque-era outfits, a dark symphonic power metal sound, and cross-dressing guitarists, it\u2019s hard to not be stunned by the looks of Versailles. Having skyrocketed in popularity since their debut, *Noble*, the band continued with consistent masterpieces of the genre until the band\u2019s mutual hiatus in late 2012. Since then, singer, Kamijo, has carved for himself a successful solo career with a vampire obsession, and the remaining members of Versailles, in addition to singer, Zin, formed the neoclassical power metal band, Jupiter. Both side projects carry on the Versailles spirit fantastically and are recommended to any fans of the genre.\u000a\u000aFan-favorite tracks:  \u000a* "[The Revenant Choir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQx1zOGmKYY)"  \u000a* "[Princess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vde0w7U2ev8)"  \u000a* "[Masquerade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrcBcYu6bAM)"\u000a\u000a##[**Sex Machineguns**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1230008783000_f.jpg)\u000a\u000aAs an obvious pun on the Sex Pistols\u2019 band name, Sex Machineguns are probably one of the most prolific metal bands in all of Japan and definitely the most prolific power metal band in Japan. Having embraced the visual kei movement in their heyday in the early \u201800s, the band has slowly shifted away from the flamboyant clothes, but their music has been constant the whole time: a vibrant and humorous mix of thrash and speed and power to create the energetic amalgamation they are. Singer and guitarists, Anchang, remains the only original member of the band, and with a new single out this year SMG seems to be making a comeback of sorts.\u000a\u000aFan-favorite tracks:  \u000a* "[Heavy Metal Thunder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFNVgI76sJY)"  \u000a* \u201c[\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044\u306a\u3081\u305f\u3044\u5371\u967a\u5730\u5e2f](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhZbq3KJaao)\u201d (Tabetai Nametai Kiken Chitai)  \u000a* "[Tekken II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0gZEn3sUng)"\u000a\u000a##[**Balflare**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Balflare_pic1.jpg)\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s the dark horse on the list. Balflare aren\u2019t notable for flashy dresses, innovating the power metal genre in Japan, or just being prolific. I\u2019m including them here due to their European style of power metal, a rare trait in most Japanese power metal bands. They\u2019re probably one of the only examples of a band that writes lyrics exclusively in English, and they have a sound very reminiscent of *Silence*-era Sonata Arctica. If for nothing else, Balflare is a great way to transition to the Japanese metal stylings. Unfortunately, they tend to stay rather dormant in between albums with few live shows or even Facebook posts to tide fans over. Hell, I hadn\u2019t even seen a picture of the band until I prepared this article.\u000a\u000aFan-favorite tracks:  \u000a* "[The Dunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub-HmO26aKo)"  \u000a* "[Waking in Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giStj5LCyNc)"  \u000a* "[Before the Dawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHNK2jXi-Fw)"\u000a\u000a#Female-fronted\u000a\u000a##[**Aldious**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Aldious.jpg)\u000a\u000aAnother element of Japan\u2019s metal scene that you\u2019ll soon start to notice is the prevalence of all-female metal bands, something that\u2019s unheard of here in the USA (The Iron Maidens don\u2019t count). And that\u2019s where Aldious shines so well. Their music is incredibly good; so good in fact that you really should neglect referencing their genders. Re:NO\u2019s voice is of a low timbre, a rare trait for any power metal singer, especially a female one, and the rest of the band play speedy power metal that accentuates Re:NO\u2019s delivery perfectly. They\u2019re definitely my most highly recommended band on this female-fronted side of things.\u000a\u000aFan-favorite tracks:  \u000a* "[Dominator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQkhio7glys)"  \u000a* "[Spirit Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgmZI1M9jz0)"  \u000a* "[Scrash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtWBan30c30)"\u000a\u000a##[**Cyntia**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/044614c3c6e9b16fa112ab9cbec6f4e41384826606_full.jpg)\u000a\u000aAs a complement to Aldious, Cyntia also does the \u201clow-pitched female singer in an all-female band\u201d thing, but Cyntia pulls it off with a bit more melody and a little less speed. Having established entirely new images for themselves with each album, their music has stayed consistently enjoyable. Its heavy/power metal hybrid lends itself well to Cyntia thanks to the teamwork between Saki and Ayano, singer and keyboardist, respectively.\u000a\u000aFan-favorite tracks:  \u000a* "[Run to the Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g09UK5hNO34)"  \u000a* \u201c[\u9583\u5149\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghauU_VBtDg)\u201d (Senkou Strings)  \u000a* \u201c[\u6df1\u611b\u30a8\u30b4\u30a4\u30ba\u30e0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bDVY5rCU20)\u201d (Shin Ai Egoism)\u000a\u000a##[**LIGHT BRINGER**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Light-Bringer-Band.jpg)\u000a\u000aNeoclassical and visual kei: those are probably the best adjectives to describe LIGHT BRINGER (caps necessary). With an even larger focus on keyboards than Cyntia, they are probably one of the happiest bands I\u2019ve heard from Japan. Fuki, the lead singer, possesses an incredibly powerful voice that\u2019s backed up by a male band who really know how to write a solo or two. What really makes LIGHT BRINGER stand out amongst all these other bands is the progressive elements they incorporate; at times, their music can be incredibly complex, jazzy, and/or technical. It\u2019s a marvelous mixture of styles that have made these guys and gals one of the most exciting modern power metal bands.\u000a\u000aFan-favorite tracks:  \u000a* "[noah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc8tHKdNieY)"  \u000a* "[Hyperion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnqud-E4aXM)"  \u000a* "[ark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZVOeTPhgnQ)"\u000a\u000a##[**Albion**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/3540368194_photo-1024x679.jpg)\u000a\u000aHere are some newcomers to the power metal scene. Having only released their debut album, *Campanula*, this year to relatively no fanfare, it\u2019s a wonder to me why more people haven\u2019t taken note of them yet. It\u2019s an album drenched in keyboards, with a relentless and liberal singer who belts out her vocal lines, and intense guitar-keyboard dueling solos that rival those of Sonata Arctica. With only the lone album underneath their belts, I\u2019d definitely recommend a listen to them on Spotify at the very least.\u000a\u000aFan-favorite tracks:  \u000a* \u201c[\u5168\u3066\u3092\u77e5\u3089\u305b\u308b\u9418\u3068\u8ff7\u5bae\u306b\u60d1\u308f\u3055\u308c\u3057\u8005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW8C_ze5NKc)\u201d (Subete o shiraseru kane to meiky\u016b ni madowasareshi sha)  \u000a* "[\u78a7\u7460\u7483\u306e\u7a7a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8EylPkjDY)" (Hekiruri no sora)  \u000a(I can\u2019t find any more of their tracks online)\u000a\u000a##[**Mary's Blood**](http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/a2ed8217.png)\u000a\u000aFinally, we come full circle to Mary\u2019s Blood, the closest thing to a female X Japan that there is. With their equal focus on speed and guitar-driven melodies, they\u2019re also probably the closest thing to a traditional metal band on this list. After 5 years of teasing fans with singles and EP\u2019s, Mary\u2019s Blood has their debut album, *Countdown to Evolution*, coming out this August, and it looks to be a consistent display of their NWOBHM-tinged speed metal stylings.\u000a\u000aFan-favorite tracks:  \u000a* "[Burning Blaze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08GNcXDuSMY)"  \u000a* "[Save the Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yjiSNw90VI)"  \u000a* "[Marionette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLM2unV0kwU)"\u000a\u000aHopefully that provided you with some new listening material and some insight into the world of Japanese power metal. There are plenty of bands that I had to leave out of this guide to preserve my sanity, like Kamijo, Gauntlet, MinstreliX, Skywings, Destrose, and others, but maybe I can cover those later in [a follow-up to this guide](http://www.metal-observer.com/3.o/an-intermediates-guide-to-the-world-of-japanese-power-metal/). I hope you enjoyed this guide and it was of some use to you.\u000a\u000aI'll reformat and post [the second part](http://www.metal-observer.com/3.o/an-intermediates-guide-to-the-world-of-japanese-power-metal/) sometime next week.

sVThe guidelines of metal
p314
VSo I was trying to find where to buy a certain album (http://www.sonicattack.de/en/default/page/open/title/download-shop) and I ended up finding the guidelines of the label in the context of demo submissions instead. I thought you might find it interesting. \u000a\u000a"We are still looking for young Metal Bands . Currently we are especially interested in Stoner Rock, Psychedelic Metal, Doom, Post Metal, Progressive Styles and anything cutting edge and forward looking. We are closed for all traditional styles of Metal and will only consider those based on recommendations. Please digest the following rules carefully before submitting your songs:\u000a \u000a1. If you are a Newcomer you should be young, very young ! The younger the better ! It takes years to build the base for a Rock Band. We are not in the Pop Business ! The average age should be well under 25 ! Don\u2019t apply if this is not the case.\u000a \u000a2. We are only interested in Bands. No Solo Projects or Duo\u2019s!\u000a \u000a3. Be unique within your Sub Genre. Make a difference. Don\u2019t imitate your Heroes (the bands on your shirts). We are not interested in clones \u2013 not even good ones. Beware of the unwritten Metal Dogmas ! We are freethinkers and don't like any dogmas ! Rules stop you from being inventive and different. Mould your style the way you need it. And foremost: write great songs, don\u2019t get lost in your technical abilities.\u000a \u000a4. Don\u2019t apply if you are not commited to sacrifice your job, career or girlfriend in exchange for the stony and rocky, yet adventurous and challenging way to rock stardom. Students beware! The digital revolution is upon us and records are just a means to secure live shows and therewith generate income. Records these days barely pay for the production costs of records.\u000a \u000a5. Don\u2019t apply if you are not a Live Band ! You should at least have perfomed a minimum of twelve shows over the last 18 month.\u000a \u000a6. Your Singer should have personality and charisma \u2013 he should be an outstanding performer . His/her voice should be a means of communication \u2013 no growls please or very minimal. The drummer should be a maniac, a force of power and precision, with the iron will of a bull. Giving the band the drive forward. The base player complements the rythm: strengthens it so that it can develop it\u2019s full potential. The guitar (s) define the acrobatic skills of any Metal Unit as well as the song structures through inventive riffing and great melodies.\u000a \u000a7. Create a visual image which reflects your musical style. Give your band a face. Rise above the nameless crowds... And within the band image, think about individuality and personality of each band member. Choose between facelessness and the risk of being special.\u000aOrganise your Army of Super-Fans by using all the means available in this digital age. Where is your Digital-Fanclub ? How many fans can you activate with one call ? Do not think any more in terms of sold CD\u2019s. Physical product (especially (CD\u2019s ) is dying fast. The power of Relationships is much more important.\u000a \u000a8. Your application should include the following: a band photo, a band bio (only the facts to keep it short) profiles of each band member, lyric sheets, a list of your live activities during the last 18 month, web links to all relevant web sites, link to an upload server for your songs, a mission statement about the bands goals.\u000a \u000a9. Also be aware that this label is only our instrument to find suitable bands for management as labels in their traditional function are a dying breed. We understand the release of a bands first album internationally as a testing ground for potential and commitment. Only those with a burning desire to break free of the shackles of employment will make it in the highly competetive music scene."\u000a\u000ahttp://sonicattackrecords.com/de/default/page/open/title/senden_sie_uns_ihre_demo

Power with progressive and speed metal influences, and also some melodeath. Many different vocal styles as well.\u000a\u000aTom Englund from Evergrey appears on the track Closer on Exlibris new release. No surprise in a way, this guy is everywhere.\u000a\u000aI think **Reason Behind** stood out this week. It's fast, melodic and sweet. They released an EP back in 2012, but The Alpha Memory is their first full-length album.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a**Highlight of the Week**\u000a\u000aAll-female japanese power metal band Cyntia are active on the japanese power metal scene. They've been releasing an album a year, and successfully released their third full-length album in february this year. The promo track ([\u9583\u5149\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9](http://youtu.be/ghauU_VBtDg)) was pretty power, but some of the stuff they released later during the year has been much more poppy. Their latest tune is called _Kiss Kiss Kiss_ and sounds more like an anime opening than a metal song. Not sure what direction they will head in the future, but it seems as if they will release an album fairly soon, so we'll just have to wait a couple of months!\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a[When your favorite vocalist returns from the dead and kind of doesn't deliver.](http://38.media.tumblr.com/21a0ca796a29aac68eed2a7b44ad6fc4/tumblr_mmho0rgx8C1sqr9w8o1_r2_400.gif)\u000a\u000a

I'm not familiar with everything on the label, but both the Instanzia and Icewind albums are must-owns for power metal fans. I ordered Vorpal Nomad and Mindfeeder, both of which sound heavily Iron Savior-influenced.\u000a\u000aI figured some people on here would be interested, as power metal CDs are usually not cheap.

sVFazermint's favorite Power Metal releases: February
p405
V###Fazermint's favorite Power Metal releases: February  \u000aFellow warriors, the moon of February has passed and it is time to reflect. What were your favorite Power Metal outings this month? Let's hear it in the comments! As for me, I will provide an overview of my own favorites below.\u000a\u000a[January's post](http://redd.it/2v37rn)\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Release highlights  \u000a[Playlist: Power Metal 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE1FmEyuepxiO3TkjfULAm-t3qw2Dh9cl)\u000a\u000a* **Winterage**: *The Harmonic Passage* - [Title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF-2N9BJYgc&amp;list=PLE1FmEyuepxiO3TkjfULAm-t3qw2Dh9cl&amp;index=7) (Symphonic Power Metal)  \u000a* **Wind Rose**: *Wardens of the West Wind* - [Rebel and Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NAsnedf9I&amp;index=8&amp;list=PLE1FmEyuepxiO3TkjfULAm-t3qw2Dh9cl) (Progressive Power Metal)  \u000a* **Tanagra**: *None of This is Real* - [The Undying Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1XDO4wNTpk&amp;list=PLE1FmEyuepxiO3TkjfULAm-t3qw2Dh9cl&amp;index=9) (Power Metal)  \u000a* **Lords of the Trident**: *Frostburn* - [Winds of the Storm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANouZi7L6g4&amp;index=10&amp;list=PLE1FmEyuepxiO3TkjfULAm-t3qw2Dh9cl) (Heavy / Power Metal)  \u000a* **Nocturna**: *Lucidity* (EP) - [Title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37VfMQiMzJM) (Symphonic Power / Progressive Metal)  \u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Fazermint's ultra-biased opinions  \u000a\u000a* **Winterage**: This band is what Twilight Force should have been: A RoF-inspired blast of symphonic goodness. We will probably never see the return of the glory days of RoF and symphonic power metal, but this album goes a long way to sate that hunger for something classic, yet entirely new. The album is pretty long: 69 minutes. It could easily have been shorter if all the filler intro/interludes were cut, which would have made the album more compact. The title track has become one of my favorite symphonic power metal tracks, with great melodies, orchestral instrumentation (primarily violins, goes for the whole album), and good vocals. The song would be perfect if it weren't for those unnecessary high-pitched squeals here and there, which goes to show that the album is largely based on inspirations from the genre and has little creativity and innovation.  \u000aThat said, the album is very dynamic, with each song being notably different from each other. "The Flame Shall not Fade" is a 7-minute long, generally slow-paced song with a few faster segments that changes things up often enough to create an enticing whole. "Wirewings" is more traditional, in the sense of being shorter and faster-paced, and has a nifty melody. "Golden Worm" is one of the strongest tracks on the album, with rock-solid instrumentation and a smashing chorus. "Crown to the Crowds" is a pretty standard, but decent track, and "The Endless Well" is pretty amazing if you don't mind the opera vocals.  \u000a**TL;DR**: *The Harmonic Passage* has some of the nicest symphonic power metal tracks I've heard in a while. The album is largely based on inspirations from the genre and has little creativity and innovation. It also suffers from some poor pacing because of filler tracks. Score: **8/10**.  \u000a* **Wind Rose**: Behind this awful name hides a manly-man power metal band. Something that is not evident in "Rebel and Free" is that the vocalist sounds pretty damn much like Russell Allen. And that, my friends, is a *good* thing. "Rebel and Free" is more chant-based, and the vocalist sounds nothing like Russell Allen using this vocal style. The slow intro that is in the video is not present on the album, but sadly the sudden pause in the middle is. The song itself is pretty fantastic, with hard-hitting drums and guitar riffs backed by melodic elements. Other songs equally worthy of the title *song of the month* are "Age of Conquest" and "Born in the Cradle of Storms", both in which the incredible Russel Allen likeness is apparent. None of these two are up on YouTube, but maybe you can find them elsewhere. As for the rest of the album, it is incredibly good throughout. It is delightfully heavy, the vocals and chants are fantastic, and it has enchanting melodic elements. I know "The Breed of Durin" is on YT, so check it out because it's another fantastic track.  \u000a**TL;DR**: This is easily the **album of the month**. Look up every track you possibly can from this album. Score: **10/10**.  \u000a* **Tanagra**: Tanagra's debut album caught my attention quickly, in part because of its album art. The song used to promote the album was "Tyranny of Time", which went a long way to get me excited for the album. It was by no means an exceptional track, but it did sound like solid power metal to me. The vocals are more than good enough, and the chorus was pretty damn amazing. The guitar riff was a bit repetitive, perhaps, but I thought it worked well enough. The guitar solo showcased that they did know how to riff properly. So yes, I was intrigued. The sound quality is at a low 128kbps, which is somewhat understandable for a debut album, but certainly not desirable in the year of 2015. After getting my hands on the album, I was delighted to hear that the opening track, "The Undying Light", was even better than "Tyranny of Time". Nice and fast, recipe-based but solid, soaring vocals, and a smashing chorus. The guitar solo is even sicker than in "Tyranny of Time", as well. The kick in the face, though, is that the rest of the album is quite forgettable.  \u000a**TL;DR**: Couple of sweet tracks on an otherwise forgettable album; production quality is sub-par. Score: **6/10**.  \u000a* **Lords of the Trident**: It is always cool when the singer (or any other member of the band, for that matter) hangs out on /r/PowerMetal. Shoutout to /u/mshabooboo for putting out a more-than-solid album! Now, some people (including myself) has called this a *fun* album. If you have witnessed any of the disastrous Gloryhammer discussions on here, you know that's a no-no. *This album is not good because it's fun*. I don't think anybody thinks so (although that's what gets taken away from our comments). *It is good in its own right*. The *fun* factor comes with the overall light-hearted vibe of the music, and the [personalities of the band members](https://wudmusic.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/lordsofthetrident.jpg).  \u000aOnto the actual album, this is a Heavy / Power Metal album. The instrumentation is generally fast-paced, and the vocal style is definitely inspired by power metal. I had a hard time picking a favorite track from this album, mainly between "Knights of Dragon's Deep" and "Winds of the Storm". Out of those two, /u/mshabooboo's favorite is "Knights of Dragon's Deep", perhaps because it is easier to sing for him. He likened singing "Winds of the Storm" to a *weightlifting marathon while being chased by rabid cheetahs*. Well, that settled it for me, "Winds of the Storm" is my favorite. If you're still not sold on the album after hearing these two tracks, I can also recommend "Kill to Die" as one of the most power metal-y tracks. The whole album is solid, anyway.  \u000a**TL;DR**: Awesome Heavy / Power with a talented vocalist, a consistently good album. Score: **8/10**.  \u000a* **Nocturna**: This was a nice little EP that I feel needs some more attention. It is their first EP, and they have yet to produce a full album. This EP shows a lot of promise. Nice and fast instrumentation, symphonic support, and interesting vocals. The vocalist has a slightly boyish voice, but I think it works well with the music. He is definitely talented. The EP has 4 tracks (excluding intro and interlude), three of which are normal length (5ish minutes) and one that is a 10-minute long semi-ballad track that switches pace every minute because it wouldn't be a power metal production otherwise ;_;  \u000aThe title track is awesome, with hard-hitting instrumentation and soaring vocals. They've made a music video of "Revelation", which is definitely worth checking out (dat mouth synchronization tho). "Gaining Solace" is another excellent track, though not to the extent of the aforementioned tracks.  \u000a**TL;DR**: A nice little EP that shows tons of promise. Hurry and make a full album, guys! Score: **7/10**\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Non-PM spotlight  \u000a* **Adrenaline Mob**: *Dearly Departed* (EP) - [Gets You Through the Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-D-b83tMr4&amp;t=5s) (Hard Rock / Groove Metal). Adrenaline Mob is a supergroup fronted by the hero Russell Allen, and they've been active for some years now. This EP is built around a song that is in no way new - it was featured on their latest full album. So why this EP exists is beyond me. Anyway, the EP does feature some new tracks, most of which are cover songs, and they're all right. The star of the EP, in my eyes, is "Gets you Through the Night", which was previously only released as a Japanese bonus track. And it's pretty awesome! Its incredible energy and smooth rhythm makes it one of my favorite tracks so far for 2015. Score: **7/10**.  \u000a* **Eclipse**: *Armageddonize* - [Stand on your Feet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r453Xtjn6bA) (Hard Rock). Eclipse is one of the best hard rock act out there. They have taken the hard rock genre and perfected it. Everything the made the genre awesome in the old days is present, just in a modern package sounding tons better. They had 2 or 3 albums from the early 2000's, which were complete crap. Then they re-invented themselves in 2008 with immensely improved recording quality and songwriting. Vocalist and producer Erik Mårtensson has an amazing voice. The album has received perfect 10/10's all over the internet, but as much as I wanted this album to be perfect - it isn't. Their previous album *Bleed and Scream* may have been worthy of a perfect score, but I'm gonna have to give *Armageddonize* a score of **9/10**.\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a[When someone declares they have lost respect for me](http://i.imgur.com/EZVyXUc.gif)

sVShould we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?
p415
VI've been thinking about this since it's now March. It might be a good way to introduce people to new bands and stimulate discussion. I don't know if something like this has been done in the past since I've only joined the subreddit in January. Would you people be interested? \u000a\u000aI understand these tournaments are essentially popularity contests, so it might be beneficial to pair the big names against each other (like Blind Guardian vs. Stratovarius) and smaller names against each other (like Almah vs. Shaman). I know sometimes people get upset that their preferred group might lose due to popularity (just look at the Ultimate-Guitar bracket contest lately), but we already exist in a subreddit of rare taste anyway, so I thought it would be interesting.\u000a\u000aIf anyone is interested, please post your ideas below. We could decide who does pairings, who sets up brackets, etc. Maybe the Mods could help too.\u000a\u000aJust an idea. Thanks! \u000a\u000aEdit 1: How about we do two separate brackets? One for popular legends and another for underdogs? \u000a\u000aAngra, Avantasia, Blind Guardian, Dragonforce, Edguy, Hammerfall, Helloween, Iced Earth, Kamelot, Lost Horizon, Nightwish, Rhapsody of Fire, Sabaton, Stratovarius, Symphony X, etc. for popular.\u000a\u000a\u000aAdagio, Albion, Altaria, Angel Dust, Aquaria, Armory, Brain Storm, Cellador, Excalion, Hammerforce, Labyrinth, Pagan's Mind, Powerwolf, Scelerata, Seven Kingdoms, Skywings, Stormwarrior, Tiluland, Twilight Force, Winterage, etc. for less popular\u000a\u000a\u000aThere are some bands where I don't really know where there popularity fall: Dark Moor, Dragonland, Falconer, Galneryus, Pathfinder, Nocturnal Rites, Theocracy, etc. \u000a\u000aEdit 2: Users have recommended albums instead. Should we do multiple albums my a single artist like several Blind Guardian and Stratovarius? You guys should list some albums for recommendation.

sVFazermint's favorite Power Metal releases: January [Revised edition]
p424
V###Fazermint's favorite Power Metal releases: January [Revised edition]  \u000aFellow warriors, welcome to the non-lazy edition of my monthly release post! I went and actually listened to the full albums, and below you can find my ultra-biased opinions and a 1-to-10-scale rating of each album. The Power Metal 2015 playlist will remain the same; that is, one song per release. Applying the same level of scrutiny as I do in my DPM series would be overkill.\u000a\u000a*This does mean my Avantasia writeup is gonna be delayed...*\u000a\u000aShoutout to /u/MadTheMad and /u/Omegakingauldron for suggesting these improvements.\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Release highlights  \u000a[Playlist: Power Metal 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE1FmEyuepxiO3TkjfULAm-t3qw2Dh9cl)\u000a\u000a* **Angra**: *Secret Garden* - [Newborn Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wIqIRK5ynM) (Progressive Power Metal)  \u000a* **Orden Ogan**: *Ravenhead* - [F.E.V.E.R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZrT_w2TAIU) (Power Metal)  \u000a* **Serious Black**: *As Daylight Breaks* - [My Mystic Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBQyssSWmL8) (Power Metal)  \u000a* **Vexillum**: *Unum* - [Over the Clouds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B43V8xIgoCM) (Folk / Power Metal)  \u000a* **Visigoth**: *The Revenant King* - [Creature of Desire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I64M_04-m98) (Heavy / Power Metal)  \u000a* **Blind Guardian**: *Beyond the Red Mirror* - [Twilight of the Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep1B_aIFPDE) (Power Metal)  \u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Fazermint's ultra-biased opinions  \u000a**Angra**: *Secret Garden* is the first Angra album that I've checked out, what with me being relatively new to the genre and all. This is also the first Angra album to be fronted by Fabio Lione, the fabulous lion, whom you know from Rhapsody of Fire among other things. The album has a very impressive line-up of guest musicians. There are too many to mention that are doing choirs and backup vocals, but *Simone Simons* of Epica sings on the title track.  \u000aMy favorite song from this album remains the opening track and lead single, **Newborn Me**. I dig the guitar riff and the keyboard segment before the vocals start. Fabio sounds great as always, and this song has the best chorus of the album, IMO. The instrumental segment is awesome, starting with some progressive riffs, followed by some acoustic guitar, and finished off with an awesome guitar solo.    \u000aThe rest of the album is packed with good songs. The main reason for me liking the songs is the instrumentation and the guitar solos, they're simply stellar. I don't think this album is Fabio's best work. Anyway, the opener is followed by two awesome tracks, "Black Hearted Soul" and "Final Light". After that, however, the album sees a bit of a weak middle part. "Storm of Emotions" is a calm song that doesn't do much for me. "Violet Sky" is equally unimpressive. "Secret Garden" sounds pretty much like an Epica track, and not a particularly good one. I mean, Simone Simons sings awesomely, but... yawn. "Upper Levels" ups the game again, with a nifty acoustic guitar intro. This is probably my #2 track on this album. Fabio's vocals are more ambitious here than on other songs, and that works in the song's favor. Some solid bass guitars in this song, and the guitar solo is quick and awesome. "Crushing Room" with Dora Pesch is another decent track. I don't care much for Dora's vocals, but the chorus is good and the instrumentation solid, and dat guitar solo, son. "Perfect Symmetry" is another good track with killer guitars between verses, great vocals by Fabio, and a pretty intense solo segment. The finisher, "Silent Call" is a weak, calm song. It's perhaps intentional, since it is an appropriate ending if you listen to the whole album in one go.  \u000aTo sum it up, *Secret Garden* is a quality outing by a quality band. The instrumentation is stellar, and Fabio is one hell of a vocalist. A slight disappointment is that Fabio's voice doesn't always *soar* above the music. I'm gonna give this a score of **8/10**\u000a\u000a**Orden Ogan**: This is a band that I had just recently fallen in love with.  The tracks "The Things we Believe In" and "To the End" from the previous album are two of my favorite tracks right now. Forget that, we're talking about *Ravenhead* now. Beginning with my favorite track of the album: **F.E.V.E.R**. Piano + choir intro, after which some pretty sick riffs are thrown at you. The album is full of these. Vocally, Fever impresses with a sweet, catchy verse. Already after the first chorus, we get the coolest solo on the album. A song full of energy and melody.  \u000aThen the other good tracks. "Ravenhead" is pretty damn good, being the fastest track on the album. The instrumentation is good, though perhaps a bit repetitive. The vocals are decent enough, although I only feel like singing along for that one line, "*all you have to do is leave the ones you love behind*". "Here at the End of the World" is less melodic than most of the other songs, but has a great pace, brilliant chorus, and of course a kickass guitar solo. "Sorrow is your Tale" is more melodic, with particularly great drums and great vocals.  \u000a"The Lake" starts off with the best intro on the album, but the intensity goes away when the guy starts singing. It's a decent song, but I expected something more intense after hearing that awesome intro. "Evil Lies in Every Man" is an all right song, but slightly ruined by the silly intro. This is the kind of shit where, if you have friends over and this pops up on the playlist, you have to explain that the intro is just weird. Totally unnecessary, the rest of the song is cool.  \u000aIf you feel like having a calm, non-intense Orden Ogan song, "Reason to Give" would be your best bet. "Deaf Among the Blind" is an all right song, nice and fast. "In Grief and Chains" is a random instrumental track... *shrug*. "Too Soon" is just a boring ending. To sum it up, I really like this album. I do feel that it lacks some character compared to *To the End*. I'm going to award this album with an **8/10**.\u000a\u000a**Serious Black**: Contrary to what the name might imply, Serious Black is a nice, regular Power Metal band with only clean vocals. Yay! It's a new supergroup that's not a supergroup at all! The band is likened to a supergroup because of the impressive line-up of well-known musicians from various bands. But they actually form a permanent band. We've got Urban Breed on vocals (Trail of Murder, Project Arcadia), Roland Grapow (Masterplan) and Dominik Sebastian (Edenbridge) on guitars, Thomen Stauch (ex-Blind Guardian), Jan Vacik on keyboards, and Mario Lochert on bass.  \u000aThe album is very reminiscent of Masterplan, particularly in the *Aeronautics* era (Grapow says hello). And that, my friends, is a very good thing. I'll introduce this album through my favorite song, **My Mystic Mind**. An epic-vibe, melodic guitar intro lets you know you're in for a treat. I absolutely dig the vocals, and also the lyrics, in this one. "My mystic mind twist my dreams and turns, tells me I will burn, tells me I will BUUUURN!"    \u000aThe rest of the album is generally pretty awesome, with only a couple of weaker songs. "Sealing my Fate" is a slow-paced that can't quite compare with the rest of the album. The title track is a ballad. I don't know about all of you, but I don't care overly much for ballads. "Temple of the Sun" is just some interlude nonsense. The rest of the album is top-notch, and I'd just recommend listening to the whole thing. I'd like to mentions two more tracks, though, that you absolutely have to listen to if you like "My Mystic Mind". The first one being "Akhenaton", which is just fine throughout and has a really great chorus. The other one is "Trail of Murder" which is obviously a nod to one of Urban Breed's other bands. Great song, too. As for the album, I'd say it's worth a solid **9/10**.\u000a\u000a**Vexillum**: An Italian Power / Folk Metal band with high-profile guest vocalists such as Hansi Kürsch. What can go wrong? Well, quite some stuff actually. If the songwriting just isn't interesting, an album can't really gain much momentum. You can throw in folk instruments in your music, but that doesn't do much unless the vocals are catchy. The song **Over the Clouds** is the only song where I feel they really pull that off. The band's main vocalist, Dario Vallesi, has a decent power metal voice, and delivers a catchy tune with this song. Guest vocalist Chris Bay does a few backup lines, but he's ultimately sounding worse than Vallesi and it'd just be better if he weren't there. Looking away from this nitpick, "Over the Clouds" is a pretty good song. Not song of the month material, but still recommended.  \u000aI only found myself caring about two of the rest of the songs. One being "Fire and Blood", featuring Hansi. Instrumentation is okay, vocals are okay. My main gripe with this song is the chaotic chorus. Vallesi and Hansi are alternating lines, but it's way too messy and incongruent. But, you know, this song has Hansi so check it out. The third song I liked is "Run Runaway", which is a Slade cover song. It's kinda silly sounding, but tons of fun to listen to. It's actually pretty well done, too.  \u000aThe rest of the album just doesn't cut it for me. Vallesi doesn't always sound equally good, and most of the songs lack catchiness and are otherwise uninteresting. It's not necessarily bad, but they're not exactly memorable tracks. I give this album a **6/10**.\u000a\u000a**Visigoth**: A Heavy / Power Metal band from the US. I don't listen to much USPM, but dammit this stuff is surprisingly good. I say surprisingly, because it is a debut album, and the band name and album art made me expect something else entirely. The album consists of only 9 songs, but most of them are over 6 minutes long. Jake Rogers is the vocalist, and his rough-y vocal style fits well with the instrumentation which is more heavy than melodic. The guy is pretty damn talented, too. The song that didn't spearhead the promotion of the album, but that should have spearheaded it, is **Creature of Desire**. This is a song from their EP *The Final Spell* from 2012. Maybe they didn't want to promote the new album with an old song. It is still, by far, the most epic song on the album. The album version has received some re-mastering touches compared to the EP version, but they're more or less the same. A real bad-ass intro riff topped off with a great power metal scream leads you into a super-intense song. It's definitely the fastest and most power-metaly song on the album. The vocals are insanely good! Super-sick guitar in-between verses and super-sick guitar solo! Wow.  \u000aAs a Heavy / Power album, you'll find that the album is largely non-melodic. In fact, their instrumentation is kind of old school, sounding somewhat like Iron Maiden. The main attraction, then, is Jake Roger's vocals and, of course, the well-written songs. The album is about half fast tracks, half slow(er) tracks. The lead single "Dungeon Master" is one of the faster tracks, which kicks some serious ass. It's got excellent guitars, great vocals, and basically just the whole package. The title track is one of the slower ones, which is also pretty damn good. Basically the whole album consists of good tracks, perhaps with the exception of "Iron Brotherhood", which I found to be the most boring song on the album. "From the Arcane Mists of Proph" is nearly 10 minutes long, but has some awesome segments. All in all, a really awesome album, **9/10**.\u000a\u000a**Blind Guardian**: Hey, I went and listened to my first full Blind Guardian album ever. Aren't you proud of me? I'm not a big fan of Blind Guardian, and here's why. If this album is any indication, their songs generally follow a structure that lacks peaks. By this, I mean that the songs slowly build up your expectations of, for example, fantastic choruses. Then they fall short by not having anything like that. More than anything else, Blind Guardian is more about the *journey* rather than the destination. This is not a criticism at all - it's a perfectly valid style. For me, though, it's not really a compelling style. Don't get me wrong, though. The instrumentation sounds excellent, despite the sub-par production quality. It's the structure, and length, of the songs that ruins it a little bit for me.  \u000aNaturally, **Twilight of the Gods** is my favorite track on the album. It's the only one that resembles the Power Metal that I'm used to, in terms of structure. Other songs that I found enjoyable are "Prophecies", "At the Edge of Time", "Sacred Mind", and "Grand Parade".  \u000aI sincerely hope, though, that this is far from Blind Guardian's best work. I believe the album is worth an **8/10**.\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Non-PM spotlight  \u000aJust some random non-PM releases that I enjoyed:\u000a\u000a* **Dracula**: *Swing of Death* - [Walking on Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9Gme_E8ZWk) (Hard Rock). A concept album and a collaboration between metal legend Jørn Lande (Jorn) and guitarist/songwriter Trond Holte. Holte has worked with Jorn on his latest solo album, but is best known for being the guitarist/songwriter for the glam rock band Wig Wam. [Here's an example of Holter rockin' it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US5NedSGPcA). As for the actual release, it's not really reminiscent of anything Jorn has done before. It's less heavy, there's a general influence of classical music, and some songs are duets with female vocalist Lena Fløitmoen. I found the lead single, "Walking on Water", to be fairly enjoyable. Holter's guitar solo is pretty smooth, generally less speed-oriented than you folks probably prefer, though. The title track is enjoyable, but it sounds more like jazz than anything else. I enjoy jazz occasionally, but it's generally not something I find myself revisiting. As much as I love everything Jorn does, I can't omit the fact that this album is pretty much forgettable. I believe a **7/10** is in order.  \u000a* **Level 10**: *Chapter 1* - [Cry no More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02NNqNocpY0) (Heavy Metal). Allen &amp; Lande may not be doing a release together, but they've both got a new release out this month. Level 10 is another new collaboration, this time between Russel Allen (Symphony X) and Mat Sinner (Primal Fear). This is a regular Heavy Metal album, and most of the tracks have a slight touch of soul music. Allen has a powerhouse of a voice, and the instrumentation is well done. I found "Cry no More" to be the most memorable track on the album. Other memorable tracks are "When the Nighttime Comes" and "In for the Kill". Beyond that, the album ended up being quite generic metal. It's redeeming feature is the fact that Russel Allen provides the vocals. I can recommend the album only if you *really* like Russel Allen. Think of this as a heavier version of his solo album. I'm gonna give this album a **7/10** as well.\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a[When I post something non-worshippy about Blind Guardian](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Jim-Carrey-Smiles-Runs-Out-of-Court-Room.gif)

V###Discovering Power Metal: Powerglove  \u000aAll right, it's time for my **Powerglove** review! Took me a while to put together, because I've got no WiFi in my own apartment yet and I'm leeching off the neighbour's WiFi, which gives me a 1-stripe signal and it only works 20% of the time, and slowly to boot. ANYWAY. I've really looked forward to doing this band, being an avid gamer and all. Ironically, it was just pointed out to me that I primarily focus on the vocals of music, so let's see how it goes with an all instrumental band!\u000a\u000aOh and I changed the headers to black, now they don't look like links (thanks to /u/MadTheMad for the suggestion).\u000a\u000a[YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE1FmEyuepxioBu4yCDeqK8Ntfgly8oC1)\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###About the band  \u000a**Genre**: Power Metal  \u000a**Country**: US\u000a\u000aPowerglove is, with one or two exceptions, an all-instrumental power metal band that makes its own renditions of beloved video game soundtracks and TV show theme songs. An awesome premise! Quite often, they are being pretty creative with the material and end up creating something of their own. Great in some cases, but in a select few cases I would have preferred it if they stayed more true to the source material. I'll explain what I mean when we come to the tracks I'm talking about.\u000a\u000aThe band has one extended play, called Total Pwnage, which was released in 2005. They've got two full albums, one focusing on video game soundtracks (Metal Kombat for the Mortal Man, 2007) while the other focuses on cartoon theme songs (Saturday Morning Apocalypse, 2010). In addition to that, they've got two remix albums. These remix albums consist partly of old tracks and new, improved versions of old tracks (primarily from the EP). The first one, "TV Game Metal" was released in 2012 (Japan only) and has 4 revisited tracks. The second one, "Video Game Metal", was released digitally this year and has two or three revisited tracks. I can't find any YouTube uploads of the latest remix album, with the exception of one of the remixed tracks.\u000a*****  \u000a###Total Pwnage (EP, 2005)\u000a\u000aTotal Pwnage marks the band's debut, and consists of seven tracks total. As is often the case with debut albums, the production quality is quite low. To reuse my line from my thoughts about Dark Moor's debut album, the drums sound like someone is hammering on frickin' Ikea boxes. It's not necessarily as bad as many other crappy debut albums, but considering most of the tracks have gotten a remix later on, it's a much better idea to go listen to those. If you're still interested in hearing some of the stuff that is on this EP, you could always check out [Tetris (Themes B and C)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trGkPerU3-k) (remixed on 2014 release), or [Mute City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OUkexdBXP8) (only non-remixed track at this point). Other than that, I wouldn't really bother with this EP.\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Metal Kombat for the Mortal Man (2007)  \u000aPlaylist additions:\u000a\u000a* [Omnishred (We're Gonna Need a Bigger Sword)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH9u3wpmxwA) - Final Fantasy VII boss theme  \u000a* [Red Wings over Baron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n01JYXwxkeo) - Final Fantasy IV medley\u000a\u000aThis album, which consists of powermetalized video game soundtracks, sees two playlist additions. Both are from the Final Fantasy franchise. I think that says more about Nobuo Uematsu, the composer of all the soundtracks in the franchise, than it says about the album itself. What I mean is, when you're basing your work upon existing work, the quality of the source material is a significant factor for the outcome. And if you've ever played a Final Fantasy game, you would probably agree on that the franchise has nothing short of fantastic soundtracks.\u000a\u000a**Omnishred** is the boss battle theme from Final Fantasy VII. Powerglove stays relatively close to the original soundtrack in terms of structure, except the segment from 1:38 to 2:23, which is of their own creation. This segment feels somewhat disconnected from the rest, jarring the intensity of the song just a little. It didn't need to be there. Its absence would make the song a lot shorter, but they could have opted to repeat the melody another time instead. Despite this minor annoyance, it is still the best version I've ever heard. The intro riff is inherently explosive and badass, and 0:39 - 0:50 is my favorite part, and 0:50 - 1:38 is incredible as well. While some credit should go to the original composer, Powerglove did a really good job with this one. You can compare it to the original soundtrack, as well as the Black Mages version (a band consisting of three of Square's composers, Uematsu being one of them).\u000a\u000a* [Original soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVBM3bX7xdw)  \u000a* [Black Mages version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzFh9GuE0rA)\u000a\u000a**Red Wings over Baron** is a Final Fantasy IV medley, taking melodies from multiple parts of the game. The beginning of the intro is of Powerglove's own creation. 0:23 - 1:07 is the characteristic "Red Wings" theme. 1:08 - 1:55 is the standard battle theme. For a specific part of the melody here, which is repeated quite a few times, Powerglove experiments with two different drum paces. It is the slower one of the two that really hits the spot (1:35 - 1:38, as opposed to 1:41 - 1:44). 1:55 - 2:36 is the "Four Fiends" theme, which is also pretty cool. 3:08 to 4:05 is a calm segment replicating the cave music of the game, and sounds nearly identical to what it does in the game. The boss theme starts at 4:15, but doesn't really kick off until 4:38, and lasts till 5:22. After that, the victory theme common to the entire franchise is played for a little while, followed by some of Powerglove's own stuff, and finished off by a segment from Powerglove that I actually like a lot, from 6:29 and onwards. All in all, the song could have been slightly more compact, but it contains so many fantastic melodies from a good old game that it is easily some of Powerglove's best work. For the interested, here are the original soundtracks. The Black Mages has their own version of the Four Fiends theme, and perhaps of the other ones too (couldn't find any using a quick search).\u000a\u000a* [Battle theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nh5QcbYvGM)  \u000a* Four Fiends theme: [Original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B08Nhzrp41c) - [Black Mages version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xItobZ34odw)\u000a* [Boss theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6iHlBN_ZM)\u000a\u000aWell, this is getting long-winded! I'll just list the additional songs on this album that are worth checking out:\u000a\u000a* [Mario Minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l1n69jTArI) - Super Mario  \u000a* [Vanquish the Holy Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdD3JRYjvtw) - Castlevania  \u000a* [Holy Orders (Be Quick and Just Shred)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdD3JRYjvtw) - Guilty Gear  \u000a* [Metal Kombat for the Mortal Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B0P4F3C2no) - Mortal Kombat\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Saturday Morning Apocalypse (2010)  \u000aPlaylist additions:\u000a\u000a* [Gotta Catch 'em All (Ft. Tony Kakko)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev3VwmpBXyo) - (Pokemon theme song)\u000a\u000aThis album consists of powermetalized cartoon theme songs. I'll just tell you right away that I'm less fond of this album compared to Metal Kombat for the Mortal Man. I'm not sure if it's a generally poor selection of source material, or the fact that I didn't watch many cartoons as a kid, or that cartoon theme songs are just less sophisticated than video game soundtracks. A little bit of each one, perhaps? Anyway, there's one song on this album that I really like, and it's the, brace yourselves, POKEMON THEME SONG!\u000a\u000a**Gotta Catch 'em All (Ft. Tony Kakko)** is the theme song of the cartoon/anime/whatever that was so insanely popular back in the day (now it's all shit, I hear). That's not the best part, though - it features vocals by none other than Tony motherfucking Kakko of Sonata Arctica! And trust me, that's what makes this song awesome. Chances are you (used to) like Pokemon, so this song is bound to tickle your inner nerd. And if you didn't, chances are you're thinking "laaaame" right now. But hear me out. Forget that this is the Pokemon theme song. You like Sonata Arctica, right? Of course you do. So think of this song as a (somewhat strange, I'll give you that) Sonata Arctica song. You with me? Aight. Let's get to the actual song. It gets progressively better as the song goes through the three verses - each verse is better than the previous one. This fact has nothing to do with the vocals, it is the *drums* that get better. The first verse (0:06 - 0:26) has what seems to me as senseless, chaotic drumming. I see this a lot in this genre... hammering on the drums as fast as you can, or adding computer-generated "machine gun" drums. On rare occasions, that works, but most of the time it doesn't really. It gets better already during the chorus. In the second verse, they manage to slow down and actually getting a drum beat with a power vibe (1:15 - 1:20, specifically). A short burst of awesomeness. Worry not, it'll come back stronger in the third verse. Before that, though, there's an awesome vocal hook (1:46 - 1:58) where Tony Kakko is shouting "Gotta catch 'em all" 6 times. After that, there's a guitar solo. Nothing stellar, but it still stands out since the guitars in the rest of the song are drowned out by the vocals. A pretty badass riff from 2:17 to 2:33 precedes the final verse, where the drums finally reach perfection. You can compare it the original theme song, or to Powerglove's non-vocal version:\u000a\u000a* [Original soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuYeHPFR3f0)  \u000a* [Powerglove, non-vocals version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_emC3mSz_6E) (sucks without Tony, eh?)\u000a\u000aAs for the rest of the album, there's really not that much to tell. My second favorite track would be X-men, and Transformers is also worth checking out. The Simpsons *does have vocals*, also by Tony Kakko. All he says is "The Simpsons" at the beginning, though.\u000a\u000a* [X-Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNLL_lxL-bQ)\u000a* [Transformers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhiiWKR9jwg)\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a### TV Game Metal (2012)  \u000aPlaylist additions:\u000a\u000a* [The Decisive Battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JzK6IbLbs) (Final Fantasy VI boss theme)  \u000a* [Birth of a God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub_RAbeZMjk) (Final Fantasy VII, Bizarro Sephiroth theme)  \u000a* [Dr. Wily Stage 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R98rj-T48Mc) (Mega Man II)\u000a\u000aThis is the first remix album, and perhaps oddly the one to provide the most playlist additions. The album has 10 tracks, and 3 of these are all 3 previous playlist additions: Omnishred, Red Wings over Baron, and Gotta Catch 'em All (Ft. Tony Kakko). It also features, non-remixed, Holy Orders, The Simpsons, and Bloody Tears / Beginning (which is identical to Vanquish the Horrible Night). The *juice of the album*, though, are the remixed tracks. There are four of these, and 3 of them warranted a playlist addition. The exception would be Storm Eagled Battle, which is still pretty good despite not being put on the playlist.\u000a\u000a**The Decisive Battle** is the boss soundtrack of Final Fantasy VI. It appeared on the EP, but this version is infinitely better. Powerglove stays pretty much true to the original soundtrack (minus a few new riffs). Honestly, I can't really say much more about this track, other than that it's goddamn awesome. I'm not being lazy, it's just awesome through and through and I don't think I need to justify why it was added.\u000a\u000a* [Original soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb-Lhkm93pI)  \u000a* [Black Mages version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHJe_Te8D5g)  \u000a* [EP version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb31vfYuXfs)\u000a\u000a**Birth of a God** is the soundtrack that goes with *Bizarro Sephiroth*, one of FFVII's final boss' forms. I actually had to upload this one to YT myself, since this remixed version was not uploaded by anyone yet. It appeared on the EP as well, and again, this version is infinitely better. My only complaint is that they miss a note at a specific point (0:48 - 0:51 and 0:54 - 0:57, and whenever this part is repeated). That even almost makes me prefer the original soundtrack. But I really do dig this version, because of the segments between 0:59 and 2:10, as well as 2:41 - 3:14. Here the song is brimming with power and sounds even better than the original soundtrack.\u000a\u000a* [Original soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H8_2vEb6PU)  \u000a* [EP version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAiOAhp_Llc)\u000a\u000a**Dr. Wily Stage 1** is the soundtrack to 2 or 3 of the Dr Wily stages at the end of Mega Man II (not just Stage 1...). This particular soundtrack has got to be the best one to ever grace the ol' Nintendo, and Powerglove does a good job translating it into power metal. The parts that are taken from the actual soundtrack are between 0:00 and 0:51, 1:03 - 1:35, as well as the final segment. So, Powerglove throws some new riffs in there. They're okay. All in all, a really good rendition of a really great soundtrack.\u000a\u000a* [Original soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJRoRt155mA)  \u000a* [EP version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V770s29vlVk)  \u000a* [Nirreman + Lee Duffy's version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXQ2a-K1QRo) (non-power, used to be my go-to Dr Wily theme)\u000a\u000aTo conclude, this remix album is all you really need from Powerglove. It has the three most listenworthy tracks from the previous albums, 3 other tracks from previous albums, and 4 really good remixes of some of the stuff that was on the EP. As for *getting a hold* of this album, that's a toughie. Apparently it was a Japan only release. It *is* available for digital purchase, though, via the big digital music stores. So it's either that or import, I guess. Oh yeah, don't forget to also check out Stormed Eagle Battle, it's decent.\u000a\u000a* [Storm Eagled Battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL6AHHWZA6U)\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Video Game Metal (2014)    \u000aOkay, can't talk much about this release since the post is too long for reddit otherwise. Digital release only, remixed version of tetris and the [Power Rangers Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5RKhoChXZg). Apparently also a remixed Duck Grinder, although I can't hear the difference on Amazon previews. The rest are old tracks, so it's not really an interesting release anyway.\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Conclusion\u000aPowerglove is a great band, particularly for gamers. Even if you aren't one, I can guarantee that you find something you like. 4 playlist additions from Final Fantasy games (thank you Uematsu), one from Mega Man II, and one Pokemon theme song. Hope you enjoyed this review! Please list your own favorites, I'm very curious how biased I was (since I have played the games of all the playlist additions). I don't have space for the whole series summary, but you can find that in the [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2mbesf/discovering_power_metal_dark_moor/).

The preview song "Rebel and Free" is basically power folk, sporting fast and nice instrumentation and choir-style vocals. Specific instrumental segments sound like they were taken from a Lost Horizon song... I can't quite put my finger on which one. Listen to 1:00 - 1:05 and you'll see what I mean. I'm curious whether this song is indicative of the entire album... we'll see. Good stuff.\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a[When I take over the weekly release threads for /u/UnlostHorizon](https://mrcobbsclass.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/olympic-relay-pivot.gif)

sVWhat are you looking forward to in (the rest of) 2015?
p472
VYeah I know I'm 3+ months late on asking that. \u000a\u000aStill, it's pretty early in the year and, apart from a glaring exception (Blind Guardian), there's not much 2015 power metal going on right now. I myself have only listened to one album so far - Orden Ogan - and it was kind of eh. Makes me feel like I'm slowly drifting away from this genre sometimes. \u000a\u000aAnyway, given what we know, is there anything for you to look forward to in 2015? [Here's](http://www.metalstorm.net/events/new_releases.php?upcoming=1) a list of upcoming metal stuff, though it's not complete by any means.\u000a\u000aI personally plan to give [Magic Kingdom - Savage Requiem](http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Magic_Kingdom/Savage_Requiem/485658) a listen once it's out even if I'm not particularly excited about Magic Kingdom (as there's nothing else at the moment).\u000a\u000a[Lancer](http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Lancer/Second_Storm/486365) are also coming out with a second album so that would also be another thing I plan to listen to at some point.\u000a\u000aOther stuff? Well Helloween are getting an album out but I can already predict it's gonna have a couple of catchy Helloween-style songs and a bunch of filler in between. I'm not craving for more Helloween anyway.\u000a\u000aHeavenly has sadly gone AWOL again, which makes me fear the album is stuck in limbo.\u000a\u000aInsania and Instanzia have promised albums this year and I genuinely look forward to both, but I don't see any update and they haven't even provided a tentative release date, so my bet is that both albums are far from over and it will be a long time until we get to listen to them. (maybe not even in 2015)\u000a\u000aHonestly the only thing that really got me excited this year was Timeless Miracle's facebook post about planning to start writing stuff for the new album.\u000a\u000aEdit: Somehow completely forgot about Cain's Offering. Okay this year doesn't sound too bad now, but I will still retain my excitement until I listen to samples.

If you don't like Japanese power metal, then you don't deserve to get a recommendation from me. Here are some other Jupiter songs appearing on the new album:\u000a\u000a"[Last Moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4t_P6kKXEk)"  \u000a"[Luminous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NJb6mUiKyY)"  \u000a"[Arcadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xQM778WyeE)"  \u000a"[Darkness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9-2eCLNAAs)"  \u000a"[\u6c37\u306e\u4e2d\u306e\u5c11\u5973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8_S7jEaWBs)"  \u000a"[Sacred Altar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swPsteGfm8I)"\u000a\u000aI expect a /u/MisterMillennia write-up on all of these tracks due by the end of the week.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a[Here's a great demonstration of why Japan is better than the USA in every regard.](http://gfycat.com/DescriptiveSecondBrocketdeer)\u000a\u000a/s\u000a\u000a**EDIT:** I just added the Rainbowdragoneyes release.

sVMushmancat's Year in Review 2014
p521
VWhelp, another year, another chance for me to give you my over-opinionated view on the past 12 months of power metal.  With finals officially over, I had the chance to sit down and sort my thoughts and come up with the best and worst of this year. Personally, I think 2014 was a step up from 2013, but i'm not sure if its just because I listened to a lot more music this year or if it really was just overall better. \u000a\u000a__________________________________________________________\u000a\u000a**10 WORST ALBUMS**\u000a\u000a**10** Skull &amp; Bones- The Cursed Island- A  ripoff of Running Wild.  They aren't even trying to hide it. Long John Silver just rips off Port Royal's chorus after taking away all the energy. Also, good luck taking the singer seriously. \u000a\u000a**9** Iced Earth- Plagues of Babylon- Pointless riffs that do nothing with Stu Block wishing he was Matt Barlow is not for me.  I would avoid this album like the plague(get it?), especially Schaffer's ballad's.\u000a\u000a**8**- Grailknights- Calling the Choir- I get it, they dress up like superheroes and cover Bonnie Tyler songs, so they are obviously aren't taking themselves seriously.  They doesn't save them from being bad. Teens who play Robot Unicorn attack will love this band. \u000a\u000a**7** 4th Dimension- Dispelling the Veil of Illusions- If you love overbearing keyboards your dick is going to be throbbing over this.  I don't remember much else about this album. Just keyboards, keyboards and more keyboards. \u000a\u000a**6** Lothlöryen- Some Ways Back Some More - What the hell does this album title even mean. \u000a\u000a**5** Betoken- Beyond Redemption - A lifeless collection of songs that just blend into one another.  Every member of the bands seems like they just can't be bothered. There are songs on that album that actually make me angry. \u000a\u000a**4** Twilight Force- Tales of Ancient Prophecies - Power metal's version of an exploitation film. If all you care about is french horns and choir vocals in the chorus, then this band is for you.  \u000a\u000a**3** Delain- The Human Contradiction - Evanescence 2.0. Not power metal.  Barely even metal.  \u000a\u000a**2** Holy Dragons- Dragon Inferno- There are actually some cool guitar parts here.  That isn't enough to save this album though.  \u000a\u000a**1** Pellek- Cloud Dancers - All Pellek jokes aside, this album is a fucking atrocity.  I started listening to this album as a goof, and finished it out of morbid curiosity.  There isn't a single song on this album that would feel out of place on your local pop radio station. \u000a\u000a__________________________________________________________\u000a\u000a**TOP 3 SONGS**\u000a\u000a\u000a**3**- [Viathyn- The Coachman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDL26Jl-Vt4)\u000a\u000a**2**- [Triosphere- Relentless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx0TFOYmmEc)\u000a\u000a**1** -[Noble Beast- Nothing to Repent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB6vN3VA_OQ)\u000a__________________________________________________________\u000a\u000a**TOP NON-POWER METAL ALBUM**\u000a\u000a[Ne Obliviscaris- Citadel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyimEeu9h-0)\u000a\u000a__________________________________________________________\u000a\u000a**TOP 10 POWER METAL ALBUMS**\u000a\u000a**10** [Skyliner- Outsiders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4TMf1WNZ9U) - A bit long winded, but a solid debut album.  Aria of the Waters is one of my favorite songs this year. \u000a\u000a**9** [Edge of Thorns- Insomnia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3yd1k17JGU)- The guitar here is the star of the show here.  Constantly something going on, which seems to be more and more rare in power metal these days.\u000a\u000a**8** [Disforia- The Age of Ether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zdj51D57nk)- Just insane power/prog metal that sounds like nothing i've heard before in the genre(So it will be ignored for the most part).  \u000a\u000a**7** [Sonata Arctica- Pariah's Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSH1zwPf2Us)- Tony rising from the ashes like a god damn phoenix. As one of the biggest doubters of this album, I am so glad I was proven wrong.  \u000a\u000a**6** [Xandria- Sacrificium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGTAmmTiD_Y)- With Nightwish continuing to push away from their old sound, i'm glad a band picked up the banner of symphonic driven power metal.  \u000a\u000a**5** [Dark Forest- The Awakening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl_rlEgXD5E)- Super catchy, very fun album. There is nothing flashy or gimmicky, so it will be under a lot of people's radar, but make no mistake, this album is up there with the best of them. \u000a\u000a**4** [Freedom Call- Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu4TGlKrc1A)- Much like Sonata, it was good to see another one of the stalwarts returning to form.  After several pointless albums, Freedom Call blew me away with this album. \u000a\u000a3- [Viathyn- Cynosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMQ8MwAqfAs)- There is no excuse for this band to not be discussed about. They should be blowing up like crazy right now.  The replay-ability of this album is off the god damn charts. \u000a\u000a**2** [Triosphere- The heart of the Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqFtlAnhzu8)- The Queen of power metal and company return with a highly anticipated follow up to the Road Less Travelled and did not disappoint.  They are currently one of the best power metal bands around.  \u000a\u000a**1**  [Noble Beast- s/t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1571Ucf3XA) - Everyone needs to take notice here, because Noble Beast just came out of nowhere to land a haymaker on this genre's jaw. This is what power metal should sound like. There are more riffs per song here than an entire Sabaton album.  \u000a

sVGuitarists of /r/PowerMetal, what are some good pickups/gear for particular sounds?

VSo I'm just getting into playing electric (played classical style for years), and I was wondering what kind of gear you use to produce your favorite tones. I'm currently playing a B.C. Rich Metal Master Warlock, though I'm looking at expanding my electric collection. I'm particularly drawn to a Judas Priest or HammerFall style sound. What would be best for this? Also, for fun, feel free to list and discuss what you prefer. Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you all!

sVThe State of the Subreddit
p562
VThe subreddit has had a bit of a shake up recently, so I thought it would be a good idea to get some discussion going on where we're headed next now that the dust has settled a bit. We had a bit of unofficial discussion regarding this, but not really in a place that was easily visible and open to comments from all of you guys.\u000a\u000aFirst up, [we recently concluded our 2014 year-end awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2v2qlp/ladies_gentlemen_those_who_identify_as_nonbinary/). The voting stage was a bit briefer than usual, but I wanted to get those out there as soon as possible since they were running later than usual, and voting had sufficiently died down to the point that I felt comfortable ending it. There's been a good amount of critiques regarding the results, so when the 2015 awards draw near we'll (mods and users together) re-examine the process and put in any new methods or rules that we think will improve the results. That said, the awards will always ultimately be a popularity contest, and I don't think too many restrictions should be placed on them.\u000a\u000aAs /u/70000tonsofmetal [brought up](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2v0bm8/great_job_mods_love_the_look_of_this_place/), /u/mushmancat has been doing a good bit of CSS and design work for the subreddit, so thanks to him and continue giving him any feedback you have.\u000a\u000a/u/Fazermint [has been continuing our weekly release threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2v3hwl/this_week_in_power_metal_releases_29_215/). My own view is that I'd like to see this become something that's shared between users, particularly so that we might get different perspectives on weekly recommendations, but your input on this would be appreciated, of course.\u000a\u000aThe sidebar has received a revision as well. We're now making use of [our wiki ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/wiki/index)to host the essential albums, along with our yearly awards. This has tidied up the sidebar quite a bit, as well as provide room for anything else we might want to include there in the future.\u000a\u000aRegarding the essential albums, redoing the list has been a much discussed matter. In the next few weeks, I'd like to see that effort be taken up.\u000a\u000aI'd also like to see more regular 'official' posts for fostering discussions -- discussions for new and old albums and the like. The first will be an discussion based around [Blind Guardian's recently released Beyond the Red Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPTz7z04_OM) to go up in the next few days. I'd like to see these go beyond 'I liked this album' or 'I liked song ____,' so if you'd like to take part give the album a few listens and form some ideas for discussion points!\u000a\u000aLastly, as you've noticed (or not), we've not done any introductions of new rules and such, nor do we plan to. However, we do have a larger and more active moderating team now, so in case incidences require us to give warnings, we will do so. If people continue being disruptive despite those warnings, they may face temporary bans. But we do think that the community does a great job of watching itself, and such occurrences where even warnings would be required are exceedingly rare. [Just remember to obey the moderator!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0nxsNRT1TU)\u000a\u000aLeave thoughts, questions, concerns, suggestions, and excellent power metal below!

sVDiscovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 2: 2010 - 2013)
p586
V###Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 2: 2010 - 2013)  \u000aFellow warriors, welcome to part 2 of my Avantasia write-up! Part 1 covered the first four albums released between 2001 and 2008. This second part covers the rest of them - 3 albums that were released between 2010 and 2013.\u000a\u000a**A friendly reminder**: This is a subjective, *song-oriented* review, not an objective account of what albums you should get.\u000a\u000aI'm gonna skip the "About the band" section, read about that in [Part 1](http://redd.it/2w7m6r).\u000a\u000aGetting familiarized with the band:\u000a\u000a* [Dying for an Angel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quH_vUCdy2o) (Music video, playlist addition #7)  \u000a* [Sleepwalking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oeuqm5j2aA) (Music video)  \u000a* [The Wicked Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFcRkTYm9NM) (Playlist addition #6)  \u000a* [The Watchmaker's Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30e47Q-xIOw) (Playlist addition #8)  \u000a* [Invoke the Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfQEclxbQrs) (Playlist addition #9)\u000a\u000aUseful links:\u000a\u000a* All my reviews: [Index](http://redd.it/2qlzcx) - [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/wiki/articles)  \u000a* The glorious [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE1FmEyuepxioBu4yCDeqK8Ntfgly8oC1)\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###The Wicked Symphony (2010)  \u000aIn 2010, Avantasia went and did something awesome: They released two albums simultaneously. Both albums are continuations of the fictional plot of *The Scarecrow*, and the three albums are often referred to as "The Wicked Trilogy". *The Wicked Symphony* is part two of this trilogy.\u000a\u000a**Returning guest vocalists**: Jørn Lande, Michael Kiske, André Matos, Bob Catley, and Ralf Zdiarstek.  \u000a**New guest vocalists**: Russel Allen, Klaus Meine, Tim "Ripper" Owens.\u000a\u000aThe album is appropriately opened with "**The Wicked Symphony**". And if you have not heard this song yet, you'll need to tighten your belt because this song will blow your pants off. The intro is a cinematic score, which immediately gives you epic vibes and builds up your expectations for the rest of the song. It might be because I have listened to this song *at least* a hundred times, but the intro makes so much sense and the climax comes at a very appropriate point, after which the drums and guitars kick in with a very nice melodic segment. Tobias Sammet opens the first verse, with 8 fantastic lines. Then Russel Allen takes over with four soaring lines, and finally Jorn finishes the last 4 lines of the verse. They sing the chorus in unison, and it's fantastic. The second verse follows the same structure, only Jorn and Sammet switch parts. After the second run of the chorus, we have an awesome guitar solo that *just makes so much sense* with the rest of the song. After it is done, Sammet does some irregular screams while a cool rhythm is running, and the two slowly merge to something more sensible and the result will send chills down your spine. Cue a short guitar solo, followed by a great bridge back to the chorus, which runs one last time. After that, the song comes to an end. I know I don't usually get this fanboyish, but this song is just perfect. I kept saying that the song *made sense*, and it does - it's such a well crafted song. The icing on the cake is the fact that all three of my favorite vocalists are teaming up in this song. They will forever be the holy trinity of my power metal heart, and their gathering has only happened once and will probably never happen again. This track is the holy grail to the religion that is power metal.\u000a\u000aHow can the rest of the album live up to such a masterpiece of an opening? Well, it can't. The next track is "Wastelands", featuring Kiske in what is a generally forgettable song. The song has good guitar work, but the vocals are average by Avantasia standards, and I get reminded how quickly Kiske's vibrato gets old. Track 3 is "Scales of Justice" with Tim "Ripper" Owens. The song itself is decent, but man, Owens' voice is downright unpleasant. It's not unclean, but not clean either. He sings high-pitched notes, and the results make me cringe.\u000a\u000aThen we get to the poppy song of the album, "**Dying for an Angel**" (sorry, /u/MadTheMad). This song is to Avantasia what "Spill Blood on Fire" is to Heavenly: An incredibly catchy song that, despite not being a powerful song at all, definitely deserves a listen. This track features Klaus Meine of Scorpions, whose voice is very different from Sammet's. That allows for very dynamic verses. It is probably the least significant song that I added to the playlist, but I do think that anyone that are into Avantasia should listen to this song. It might be too poppy for you, but if you can appreciate song recommendations based purely on catchiness, this one just might stick in your mind.\u000a\u000a"Blizzard on a Broken Mirror" is another forgettable track. I don't really have much to say about it. The chorus is pretty bad. Let's just move on to "Runaway Train", which features Kiske, Jorn, and Bob Catley. The song starts out like a ballad, but gains some momentum after a minute or so. Out of the four vocalists, I'd say Sammet sounds best in this one. It's a decent power metal ballad. "Crestfallen" has some kind of abstract, pop-like vibe. Sammet's performance on the first verse is decent, but the chorus makes my ears hurt. Jorn does a good job on the second verse, but even Jorn can't save this song. "Forever is a Long Time" is a much more pleasant song that better utilizes Jorn's powerful voice. The instrumentation here is pretty bland, but Jorn and Sammet's vocals make it an enjoyable track nonetheless.\u000a\u000aRalf Zdiarstek returns in "Black Wings", but the song is too slow to let him pull any of those amazing vocals he did in *The Metal Opera*. A forgettable track, to put it mildly. Things get better with "States of Matter", featuring Russel Allen. The faster tempo is welcome after the bulk of the album being generally slow. Allen sounds fantastic as always, as does Sammet. One of the more enjoyable tracks on the album. The album is closed with ballad-like "The Edge".\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Angel of Babylon (2010)  \u000aThe third and final part of the Scarecrow trilogy. It is also, in my opinion, the weakest album of the bunch. Not a single playlist addition here.\u000a\u000a**Returning guest vocalists**: Jørn Lande, Michael Kiske, Oliver Hartmann, Bob Catley.  \u000a**New guest vocalists**: Russel Allen, Jon Oliva, Cloudy Yang\u000a\u000aThis album opens with "Stargazers", featuring Jorn, Allen, and Kiske. Initially, the song sounds very promising. When you compare this song to "The Wicked Symphony", "Stargazers" simply does not deliver. The intro sounds promising indeed, with Sammet, Jorn and Allen doing some lines each. Kiske doesn't until the first verse. The instrumentation has a fast tempo, but is a little lacking in melody. The main attraction here is the vocals, and all four vocalists are excellent. Some extra props should go to Allen, he sounds absolutely magnificent in this track, especially between 4:35 - 5:05. The chorus is forgettable by Avantasia standards, and while it is definitely a strong track in its own right, it lacks an overall memorability. "Angel of Babylon", featuring only Jorn this time, is very similar in vibe to "Forever is a Long Time" on *The Wicked Symphony*: The dynamic duo of Sammet and Jorn delivers another enjoyable track, average in instrumentation but with fantastic vocals and a feel-good vibe overall. The third track of the album is "Your Love is Evil", which is soloed by Sammet. It's slower, with steady drums and little guitar work. From a different perspective, you could say there's no distractions from the vocals, and Sammet does not disappoint here. Another enjoyable track.\u000a\u000aThen we get to a weird ass song. "Death is Just a Feeling" is a creepy-vibe song fronted by Jon Oliva. Like with "Scales of Justice" on *The Wicked Symphony*, the the voice keeps the song from being enjoyable, at least to me.  \u000aThe album takes a turn for the better again with "Rat Race", again featuring Jorn. The tempo is faster again, and this song actually seems some decent guitar work backing up the vocals. Jorn kicks off the first verse, and Sammet does the second half of the first verse. Sammet solos the chorus this time around, and it's a grabbing one. The second verse is sung solely by Sammet, as well. After the second run of the chorus, at 2:55 we get one of the best guitar solos on the album.\u000a\u000aThe rest of the album remains forgettable. "Promised Land", originally featured on the *Lost in Space* EP, is somewhat of a remedy to the otherwise weak second half. Besides that, they're all more or less forgettable. "Down in the Dark" is a slow track featuring Jorn, which honestly bores me. "Blowing Out the Flame" is a boring ballad, something I feel that Avantasia does way too often. Things get weird in "Symphony of Life". A creepy synthesizer intro, and vocals by female guest vocalist Cloudy Yang. Sammet doesn't participate in this song. The vocals are okay, but the song is very out of place with the rest of the album, hell, the whole trilogy, hell, the whole discography!\u000a\u000a"Alone I Remember" has a decent acoustic guitar intro, and Jorn makes yet another appearance. It's yet another slow-paced song, however, and while the vocals are great as per usual, it just simply isn't memorable. If you didn't have enough ballads yet, the album ends with one: "Journey to Arcadia", with Allen and Bob Catley. Dammit, I'm tired of these ballads!\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###The Mystery of Time (2013)  \u000aALLRIGHT KIDS, it's time for **Avantasia's best album**!!!! In terms of style, *The Mystery of Time* hits a middle point between *The Metal Opera* and *The Scarecrow*. The album is more speed-based overall than the previous three albums, which is a welcome change.\u000a\u000a**Returning guest vocalists**: Michael Kiske, Bob Catley, Cloudy Yang.  \u000a**New guest vocalists**: Joe Lynn Turner, Biff Bayford, Ronnie Atkins, Eric Martin.\u000a\u000aThis album starts off much in the same vein as *The Wicked Symphony*. "Spectres" pretty much follows the structure of "The Wicked Symphony", with a cinematic score building up the song, followed by a melodic kickoff. Whereas the verses are largely different, the chorus is very similar. Sammet is supported by Turner here. This song is also much shorter than "The Wicked Symphony", clocking in *only 6 minutes*. It's a great start of the album, to say the least. However, it doesn't knock my pants off like "The Wicked Symphony" does.\u000a\u000aThe high quality is maintained in "**The Watchmaker's Dream**". This is one of Avantasia's more cheerful songs, in vibe and melody at least. The intro riff is deliciously energetic and positive. This is Turner's time to shine, with an absolutely fantastic first verse. The instrumentation during the first verse is almost non-existent, which only amplifies the magnificence of the powerful lines Turner is dishing out. After a fantastic "oooh nooo", the chorus hits you, and it hits hard. At first it may sound like a chorus build up, but it's actually the chorus itself. Because of, or despite that fact, the chorus is absolutely gripping and amazing. For the second verse, Sammet delivers a crushing first line, after which Turner finishes the second verse. However, Sammet does the chorus this time, and it's awesome. After that, an amazing guitar solo makes its entrance, and it fits perfectly with the pace and vibe of the song. Finally, the chorus returns for a full third time, and it phases out with a fourth run.\u000a\u000a"Black Orchid" takes on a slower pace, with a symphonic intro. Biff Byford makes his first guest appearance for Avantasia here, and he definitely sounds good. The verses are great, the chorus less so. Honestly, though, this is one of the most forgettable tracks on the album. "Where Clock Hands Freeze" is probably the Avantasia song in which Kiske sounds best, in what is a pretty standard Avantasia song. Definite check-out recommendation from me.\u000a\u000aThen we have "Sleepwalking", the song that spearheaded the promotion of the album. Which is baffling, to say the least, because this is a pop song. At the time, it definitely turned me off and lowered my expectations for the album greatly. The song attempts very hard to be dramatic, but that kinda works against it. Both Sammet and Yang's vocals are commendable, but this song just simply isn't good.\u000a\u000a"Savior in the Clockwork" sounds like an album opener, with a cinematic intro. It's the longest song on the album, and features Kiske, Turner, and Byford. The pace is nicely fast-ish, and the instrumentation is decent enough. The main attraction, as usual, is the vocals. I'm 90% sure Turner solos the first verse, sounding good doing so. Sammet spearheads the chorus, and it sounds pretty awesome. The second verse is soloed by Sammet, sounds awesome as usual. After the second run of the chorus, we hear Byford in the bridge leading into some nifty guitar riffs. I don't really hear Kiske in the mix, though... o_O\u000a\u000aNext up is "**Invoke the Machine**", which is filled to the brim with energy, intensity and awesomeness! The song immediately kicks you in the nuts with the sickest guitar solo Avantasia has ever put out. Holy fucking shit, that's all I have to say. Sammet delivers some excellent lines, followed by Ronnie Atkins delivering equally excellent lines with his rough-y voice. The fast pace is maintained also in the chorus, making the song sound wholesome and intense throughout. The chorus is decent enough, but the verses are where it's at. The sick intro riff returns after the chorus, which is a good choice. I have no clue who does the first lines of verse 2. Roy Khan? Idk. Sources only cite Ronnie Atkins, but it sounds nothing like his other lines. Maybe he simply switches vocal styles. The guitar solo towards the end of the track is cool enough, but it doesn't come close to the intro riff, honestly.\u000a\u000aIt's not an Avantasia album without a ballad. "What's Left of Me" takes care of business. This is Eric Martin's only appearance for Avantasia. Too bad for him that he was featured on a forgettable ballad. The Kiske man kicks it up a notch in "Dweller in a Dream", returning to the fast pace we all know and love. This song goes to show that Sammet and Kiske *can* be a deadly duo. The album closes with ballad-like "The Great Mystery", being supported by Catley, Turner, and Byford. The song is 10 minutes long. I can't recommend a 10-minute long ballad. I just can't. The song does see some heavier segments, but only slightly, and they're few and far between. I bet that it's an appropriate album closer from an artistic viewpoint. But all I want is some power meturls, dammit!\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Conclusion  \u000a**TL;DR**: Check out "The Wicked Symphony", "Dying for an Angel", "The Watchmaker's Dream", and "Invoke the Machine".\u000a\u000a*The Scarecrow* was finished off with two albums with some great songs in between but with far too many ballads. I'm not afraid to call *The Mystery of Time* the best album Avantasia has put out.

p604
VWith bands such as Blind Guardian, Orden Ogan and Nightwish releasing multiple versions of their new album, this brings up the biggest question; which one should you get?\u000a\u000aIs there a difference between getting the standard version, the digipak version and the Earbook version other than price?\u000a\u000aWhat of those who want vinyl? Do you get absolutely everything or are you fine with one format of music?\u000a\u000aAnd as with the case of Orden Ogan, do you need superfluous items such as a bust or is it not needed?\u000a\u000aThis is mostly for my knowledge as I'm unsure on what to get for these bands.

VIt's that time of year again. Namely the end of it. With not much on my radar before 2015, here's a brief look at Chapter 2014 in the Book of Power Metal as I saw it:\u000a\u000a----\u000a\u000a**The Amazing**\u000a\u000aFreedom Call - Beyond\u000a\u000aSonata Arctica - Pariah's Child\u000a\u000aGamma Ray - Empire of the Undead\u000a\u000aEdguy - Space Police: Defenders of the Crown\u000a\u000aElvenking - The Pagan Manifesto\u000a\u000aSabaton - Heroes\u000a\u000aFalconer - Black Moon Rising\u000a\u000aAlestorm - Sunset on the Golden Age\u000a\u000aUnisonic - Light of Dawn\u000a\u000a----\u000a\u000a**The Good**\u000a\u000aPrimal Fear - Delivering the Black\u000a\u000aWinterstorm - Cathyron\u000a\u000aBattleroar - Blood of Legends\u000a\u000aTwilight Force - Tales of Ancient Prophecies\u000a\u000aDerdian - Human Reset\u000a\u000aDragonForce - Maximum Overload\u000a\u000aHammerFall - (r)Evolution\u000a\u000aNeonfly - Strangers in Paradise\u000a\u000a----\u000a\u000a**The Not Bad**\u000a\u000aIced Earth - Plagues of Babylon\u000a\u000aPersuader - The Fiction Maze\u000a\u000aIron Savior - Rise of the Hero\u000a\u000aBrainstorm - Firesoul\u000a\u000aCrystal Eyes - Killer\u000a\u000aAstral Doors - Notes from the Shadows\u000a\u000aBloodbound - Stormborn\u000a\u000a----\u000a\u000a**The Ugly**\u000a\u000aTimo Tolkki's Avalon - Angels of the Apocalypse\u000a\u000aMachinae Supremacy - Phantom Shadow\u000a\u000a----\u000a\u000a\u000a**Quick Summary**\u000a\u000aThis year has been a *very* good quality year for power metal. It's central theme has been bands returning to form and improving upon their last release. Freedom Call and HammerFall back to roots with more focus on good old cheesy power metal, Sonata in places back to a pre-Unia sound, Edguy somewhat coming out of the hard rock phase, Gamma Ray improving on To The Metal, Alestorm showing they're far from running dry, Unisonic delivering the power metal we all wanted, beautiful magic from Elvenking and Primal Fear delivering a classic. Not to mention more good stuff from DragonForce with Marc, solid stuff from Sabaton, more decent stuff from Derdian and a some promising potential from Neonfly.\u000a\u000a----\u000a\u000a**Snake_Byte's 2014 Album of the Year**: Falconer - Black Moon Rising\u000a\u000aAfter such strong competition this year this was a very hard choice but at the end of the day I had to go with something consistently joyful to listen to, where every song brings a smile. This is one of those "I have to listen to it all in one go" albums. It's damn near-flawless and such a big improvement on Armod. It's ballsy, it's atmospheric, it's heavy, it's gentle, it's folk-y, it's shred-y, it's melodic, it's intricate, it's got narrative, it's got Mathias showcasing his best and everyone playing out of their skin. A firm Falconer classic and no mistake. \u000a\u000a----\u000a\u000a**Snake_Byte's 2014 Biggest Disappointment of the Year**: Iron Savior - Rise of the Hero\u000a\u000aI was SO close to saying Timo Tolkki's Avalon - Angels of the Apocalypse but you know what that's just bad without surprise. Whereas with Iron Savior I really expected something more than this after enjoying The Landing so damn much. I love Piet Sielck and even though Iron Savior have a tendency to sound samey, this just feels so generic compared to The Landing. It's not a bad album, not by far, it's very listenable it just lacks originality and sounds like it could've been spat out in a week.

VYear end posts seem to be the hip thing right now, so here's mine! Unlike the others, this isn't going to be a top __ list, though there will be a little of that. I've figured there have been enough of those, and more will likely come. So I'll rather be doing my own sort of year end awards!\u000a\u000aFor the purposes of getting other names out there, the winners of the top two categories will not be eligible for categories 3 - 5, either in a winning or running up position.\u000a\u000a\u000a1\u005c. **Best Album: [Falconer - Black Moon Rising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXhJhoxdpzY)**\u000a\u000aUpon the release of the first single, 'Locust Swarm,' I admit I was skeptical. Unlike others, the song didn't immediately grab a hold of me, and I'd say it remains in the bottom two tracks of this album, though it has grown on me. However, this album was ultimately stunning to me. The riffs are energetic, the vocals are buttery and outstanding, the solos do a great job of releasing the energy the songs build up. While it has its comparatively weaker moments, the album remains strong throughout, and it does a great job with pacing. There's a great mix of all out power metal energy, folk inspiration, heavy riffing, and calmer moments. The result is not just my favorite album of the year, but Falconer's best album yet, and a work which should be heralded as among the best this subgenre has to offer.\u000a\u000a*Runners up: Persuader - The Fiction Maze, Disforia - The Age of Ether, Triosphere - The Heart of the Matter*\u000a\u000a2\u005c. **Best Song: [Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep1B_aIFPDE)**\u000a\u000a(Disclaimer: I am a proud participant in the Blind Guardian circlejerk!) When Blind Guardian puts something out, it's not even really fair. They are the gold standard for the genre. Hansi's vocals contain an unmatched ferocity, and André's songwriting contains a unique combination of complexity and catchiness which I've yet to find another band capable of matching. Twilight of the Gods is an excellent demonstration of these qualities as the gods of power metal relentlessly pump out energetic riffs, and engaging solo, and, of course, beautiful layered vocal work.\u000a\u000a*Runners up: Freedom Call - Beyond, Persuader - One Lifetime, Sabaton - No Bullets Fly*\u000a\u000a3\u005c. **Best Male Vocalist: [Jens Carlsson \u005c(Persuader\u005c)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICLgZfAISI)**\u000a\u000aI suppose, given my deep love for the vocals of Hansi Kürsch, it's not surprising that this be given to someone who's often compared to Blind Guardian's vocalist. But to give that as Carlsson's greatest claim would be unfair, as he is a fantastic vocalist in his own right, and I actually think this is the album where he sounds least like Hansi. His clean vocals are fierce and powerful, and he complements them with more than competent harsh vocals on occasion. \u000a\u000a*Runners up: John Yelland (Disforia), Vasilis Georgiou (Black Fate), Sir Robert (Noble Beast)*\u000a\u000a4\u005c. **Best Female Vocalist: [Ida Haukland \u005c(Triosphere\u005c)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqFtlAnhzu8)**\u000a\u000aFemale vocals in metal are usually operatic, or they take their feminine qualities and push them as far as they can go. Not Ida - these vocals are rough and aggressive! They work with Triosphere's excellent riffs very well, and provide an energy that even many male vocalists fail to match. Ida is a great example that female vocals can not only be fit for metal, but that they can molded for and excel in this genre.\u000a\u000a*Runners up: Dianne van Giersbergen (Xandria), Emily Alice Ovenden (Pythia)*\u000a\u000a5\u005c. **Best Solo: [DragonForce - The Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7F3SU5BRw)**\u000a\u000aDragonForce is a band principally known for solos, and I can't say that I've found as much worth in them as others. However, with this track, DragonForce is doing something actually fairly alien to not only their sound, but power metal in general. Even more surprising: it works and I like it quite a bit! There's energy and DragonForce's typical technicality, but also a sort of downward chaos that fits the themes of the song quite well.\u000a\u000a*Runners up: Kamijo - Heart, Noble Beast - Iron Clad Angels, Sonata Arctica - Running Lights*\u000a\u000a6\u005c. **Best Comeback: [Persuader - The Fiction Maze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdaZ4yWR3k8)**\u000a\u000aIt was eight long years since Persuader's last album, but not only did they come back - they came back near flawlessly! The Fiction Maze would be my album of the year if not for Black Moon Rising. While many of the bands that have put out albums more frequently have stagnated, Persuader came in with something that's aggressive, heavy, and exciting. While it does feel like we skipped a step in their growth over those eight years, what we have leaves little to want for.\u000a\u000a*Runner up: Freedom Call - Beyond*\u000a\u000a7\u005c. **Most WTF: [Moonrise: A Symphonic Metal Opera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBvl-AdnHGY)**\u000a\u000aPretty good orchestration, fun riffs... and My Little Pony? I only have a passing familiarity with the Brony phenomenon, and I'm not too sure what to make of this. Power metal isn't at all alien to cheesy stories, so at least it's not too out of place.\u000a\u000a8\u005c. **Most Unexpected: [Pentakill - Smite &amp; Ignite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUiOylPbfV0)**\u000a\u000aIf you told me that Jørn Lande, ZP Theart, and Derek Sherinian were going to appear on an album together this year, I would've asked where I had missed the Avantasia announcement. If you told me that album was going to be from Riot Games and based on a band in League of Legends, I would have laughed in your face! The result isn't amazing, but it's competent power metal with some pretty good songs.\u000a\u000a*Runner up: Freedom Call - Beyond [Because who expected them to be that good again?!]*\u000a\u000a9\u005c. **Best album art: [Falconer - Black Moon Rising](http://i.imgur.com/BKZGxtH.jpg)**\u000a\u000aI love the artistry, the use of color, and the details that manage that not to detract from the focus of the art... but most of all: *that falcon!*\u000a\u000a*Runner up: Sabaton - Heroes (Special Edition)*\u000a\u000a10\u005c. **Biggest Disappointment: [Gamma Ray - Empire of the Undead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkF-ErMnwNo)**\u000a\u000aOh, Gamma Ray, won't you please release something excellent again? Ok, to be fair this album was a big step up from their last couple of releases, but they seemed to have lost their spirit after 2005's Majestic. There was hope for this album, but it's still not quite yet. What's worse is that there are moments which could have fit very well into an excellent album, but they prove to only tease the listener for what could have been. Hopefully Kai Hansen proves next time why he's in the power metal pantheon!\u000a\u000a*Runner up: Edguy - Space Police (Defenders of the Crown)*\u000a\u000a11\u005c. **Most Likely to Be Forced Onto Your iTunes Account by Apple/Labels: [Amaranthe - Massive Addiction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AHiZ2g6FyE)**\u000a\u000aThis label-generated metalcore/pop bullshit isn't even power metal! Olof, I want my Dragonland!!!\u000a\u000a*Runner up: DragonForce - Maximum Overload*\u000a\u000a12\u005c. **Most Anticipated: [Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvH9vC66P6M)**\u000a\u000aThe proper return of the gods awaits! Beyond the Red Mirror promises quality songwriting, amazing vocals, thrilling orchestrations, wonderful choirs... you get the point! Beyond the Red Mirror is also Hansi's first attempt at a concept album based on his own story, one based off of an idea he had in *Imaginations from the Other Side* twenty years ago! The glimpses we've had promise true grandeur!\u000a\u000a*Runners up: Orden Ogan - Ravenhead, Symphony X - TBA*\u000a\u000a13\u005c. **Best Fantasy Book: [Brandon Sanderson - Words of Radiance](http://brandonsanderson.com/books/the-stormlight-archive/words-of-radiance/)**\u000a\u000aGiven the heavy role that fantasy plays in power metal, I thought it appropriate to highlight other avenues of that genre as well. Starting out, we have Brandon Sanderson's Words of Radiance, book two in his *Stormlight Archive* and a sequel\u000ato *The Way of Kings*. The first book I thought was good, but not great, but this one is the book which really shows that this series has promise. Maybe Hansi will one day write some lyrics based on it?\u000a\u000a14\u005c. **Best Fantasy - Other Medium: [Dragon Age : Inquisition](http://www.dragonage.com/#!/en_US/home)**\u000a\u000aDA:I is the third main entry in the Dragon Age series, following the amazing Dragon Age: Origins and the rather lackluster Dragon Age 2. Don't worry though, Bioware has returned to much of their former glory with Inquisition. While the gameplay isn't quite what I'd like it to be, it's still very fun. The story, if generic, is interesting enough - and good Creator is there a whole lot of lore to consume! That's all combined with a good deal of content and fantastic visuals, both with art design and graphics.\u000a\u000a*Runners up: Divinity: Original Sin, HBO's Game of Thrones (Season Four)*\u000a\u000a15\u005c. **Best Non-Power Metal: [Devin Townsend Project - Z^2 : Sky Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRFHR19EW34)**\u000a\u000aIf Amaranthe is a lesson in how *not* to do pop metal, the Devin Townsend Project has increasingly become a lesson in how to do it properly. Sky Blue isn't a very intricate album, but it is fun, varied, and reflective. It's surprising that the disc which at first was just an obligation to the studio turned out to be, by far, the better of the two Z^2 albums.\u000a\u000a*Runners up: The Glitch Mob - Love Death Immortality, Opeth - Pale Communion, Devin Townsend - Casualties of Cool*\u000a\u000a\u000a

sVSavatage reunion...question about Vocalist
p660
VSo Savatage is playing a reunion show in Wacken.\u000aNow my question about this is the following.\u000a\u000aIf  Zachary Stevens does not sing in Wacken, would you still call this a reunion?\u000a\u000aReason I am asking is, that the he sang on (IMO) four of last albums and he was the front-man during the height of their career.\u000aDisclaimer:\u000aI am skipping Poets and Madman as that album came out as a half ass try and clearly deserved more effort.\u000aAnd I have not seen any confirmation that Zach will be at Wacken with Savatage.\u000a

V[Non-tl;dr version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uBQkAA49kt6NbCeOQc_Wtsy5rpS1O8x3Fa-dIrobFh4/edit?usp=sharing)\u000a\u000a**Iron Savior, tl;dr version**\u000a\u000aIn the power metal circles I've been a part of, Iron Savior is generally acknowledged but isn't one of the top bands that people talk about. They don't have the musical variety of a band like Sonata Arctica or Stratovarius, but they do what they do extremely well.\u000a\u000aIron Savior's initial claim to fame was having both Thomen Stauch and Mr. Power Metal, Kai Hansen in their lineup. This was rounded out by Hansen's childhood friend Piet Sielck on vocals and guitars. Both Hansen and Stauch later left the band, but Sielck carried on with new people. He was previously involved with the production on some Gamma Ray and Blind Guardian albums.\u000a\u000aThe band's music is centered around the sentient spaceship known as the Iron Savior. The idea for this came from a sci-fi book that Sielck had been writing, and the band has written four concept albums around it. This story has mostly been dropped since then, but the ship still graces the band's album covers and makes an appearance on one or two songs every time.\u000a**[Iron Savior (1997)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvNazUnle2rRRaVJzBlc6oHZOFNxJcbt9)**\u000a\u000a*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, bass, vocals), Kai Hansen (guitar, vocals), Thomen Stauch (drums)*\u000a\u000aLike many bands' first album, Iron Savior's debut album is a little rough around the edges-production wise. They hadn't found their sound yet; you can really hear the Judas Priest influence in some places. It's a solid album but their weakest in my opinion. It's not as cohesive as an album as some of their future albums, but there are some very good songs nonetheless.\u000a\u000a*Notable songs from this album:*\u000a\u000a[Atlantis Falling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PseK0lgnT4) - This song gets right to the point, introducing both the story and the band's musical style. It's slightly faster than midtempo, and has a great main riff. A good headbanging song.\u000a\u000a[Children of the Wasteland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8dEZWGBpRk) - My personal favorite off this album. It's another solid midtempo song, with a pretty awesome solo. Sielck likes to include these small interludes in a lot of his songs that could almost be their own song. 2:54 is the first of these and there are many more in future albums.\u000a\u000a[Watcher in the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlZ7ZbKxzV4) - The first song with Kai Hansen singing. He wrote this one and it is also on Gamma Ray's album Somewhere Out in Space. Hansen's vocals are pretty similar to his singing in Gamma Ray. Sielck also sings a verse, which is pretty cool. Songs where both of them sing are among my favorites.\u000a\u000a**[Unification (1999)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvNazUnle2rRhHynE684f1PX3nVWGlVXW)**\u000a\u000a*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Kai Hansen (guitar, vocals), Jan Eckert (bass, vocals), Andreas Kück (keyboards), Dan Zimmermann (drums)*\u000a\u000aIron Savior's sound really shines on this album. They added bassist Jan Eckert and keyboardist Andreas Kück, who mostly adds to the general atmosphere of the music. Thomen Stauch was also traded out for Dan Zimmermann from Gamma Ray. The tone is much better and the sound is a lot fuller. Unfortunately the full album isn't on Youtube, but if you can get your hands on it I recommend listening to it front to back. It is a very cohesive album and the band creates the sci-fi atmosphere really, really well. \u000a\u000a*Notable songs*\u000a\u000a[Coming Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_cVxEiMdzk) is one of Iron Savior's most famous songs. It exemplifies their style and is a good song for people new to the band. It's got one of those choruses you can't help but sing along to.\u000a\u000a[Forevermore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeYz4xJ8ors) isn't a song you would probably come across if you were looking for Iron Savior music on Youtube. It's a slow song, every metal album has to have one right? But this one has Kai singing, and has some amazing vocal harmonies. I highly recommend it.\u000a\u000a[Gorgar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3wRYbVkz1o) - Did you know Piet Sielck was in an early incarnation of Helloween? He contributed to some of the early songs.\u000a\u000a**[Dark Assault(2001)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvNazUnle2rThhGjAnA31tg91yjbxQi0U)**\u000a\u000a*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Kai Hansen (guitar, vocals), Joachim Küstner (guitar, backing vocals), Jan Eckert (bass, vocals), Andreas Kück (keyboard), Thomas Nack (drums)*\u000a\u000aThe band added guitarist Joachim Küstner for this album. He has only one solo on this album, but really shines in the future. They also traded out Dan Zimmermann for Thomas Nack, who did drums on one Gamma Ray album. Stylistically, this is pretty similar to Unification. The songs again work together well as a cohesive unit, and build up both the atmosphere and the storyline. Again they are a mix of mid-tempo and uptempo, though this album is overall a bit faster than the last one. I also couldn't find videos for all the songs on YouTube, which is a shame because this album is another incredible one to sit down and listen to. \u000a\u000a*Notable songs*\u000a\u000a[Solar Wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pRnbrUomCs) has some of Kai Hansen's harshest vocals with the band. This is one of the first songs that doesn't necessarily have to do with the story, though stylistically it is of course pretty similar.\u000a\u000a[Predators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIjblIRLGLA) has Hansen and Sielck singing back-to-back, alternating lines throughout the verses, it's really cool. This is another "let's go kick some alien ass" song. This is Küstner's time to shine; the solo on this song is 100% him.\u000a\u000aI couldn't find a video of **Made of Metal**, but it is one of my favorite songs off this album. It is a slightly slower song about the Savior lamenting what it has done. It has found peace with itself and is returning to Earth.\u000a\u000a[Back into the Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaj4lKxYFm4) is my favorite song from this album. I think it needs to be listened to after the rest of the album to really feel its impact, but it is still good on its own. It is a good (half of the) climax/resolution to the album and you can feel the tension.\u000a\u000aSongs I couldn't find a video for:\u000aMade of Metal\u000aAfter the War has a verse sung by Jan Eckert and serves as the other half of the resolution.\u000a\u000a**[Condition Red(2002)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFD636A5B98B6090C)**\u000a\u000a*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Joachim Küstner (guitar, backing vocals), Jan Eckert (bass, vocals), Andreas Kück (keyboard), Thomas Nack (drums)*\u000a\u000aKai Hansen dropped out after the last album. Thankfully, the only thing missing is his vocals and his small contributions to songwriting. I have heard many people say this is their favorite Iron Savior album, and with good reason. Once again, it is a very, very good complete-sounding concept album. At this point you might say Iron Savior is predictable and doesn't have a lot of variety, and you're probably mostly right. But they do it so beautifully that it might not even matter.\u000a\u000a*Notable songs*\u000a\u000a[Mindfeeder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj9KDp1bjQw) (my personal favorite) is one of the most badass songs by a band that does almost nothing but badass songs. It is about the bad guy, Randor CulDranoc and his return to take revenge on those who wronged him. \u000a\u000a[Paradise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9yewsdsveI) is a send-off for both the album, and the story. It is more appreciated by listening to the full album. The Savior has reaffirmed its mission to protect Earth, and sees off a crew that is sailing for new worlds.\u000a\u000a**[Thunderbird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFyKGt8iCeQ) has the single greatest intro I have ever heard in a song, ever. If you listen to nothing else in this guide please for the love of god listen to the first minute.** \u000a\u000aThis album also has an interesting cover of Crazy, by Seal. I think the original is better but it's still interesting to listen to.\u000a\u000a**[Battering Ram(2004)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL37E7371ABE933FFB)**\u000a\u000a*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Joachim Küstner (guitar, backing vocals), Yenz Leonhardt (bass), Thomas Nack (drums)*\u000a\u000aOn this album Iron Savior is a little more straight-up heavy metal. The title track opens up the album and isn't super fast like the last 2 openers. The full sound is still there, but without the keyboards. They brought in Yenz Leonhardt (Stormwarrior) to replace Jan Eckert and his sound is a little different. He gets to shine every once in a while. \u000a\u000a*Notable songs*\u000a\u000a[Riding Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUQwBt8q5LM) is probably Iron Savior's fastest song post-concept albums. It is has another one of the interludes that could possibly be expanded on to be its own song at 4:10.\u000a\u000a[Machine World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XwH-65DgUM) didn't get put in that playlist for some reason. It's slow, but heavy, and is part of the story.\u000a\u000a[Living on a Fault Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYfK2noxzgA) is the single most depressing song Iron Savior has written. It's slow, and it's different from anything Iron Savior has done. Highly, highly recommended.\u000a\u000a**[Megatropolis (2007)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL36B8070A96789101)**\u000a\u000a*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Joachim Küstner (guitar, backing vocals), Yenz Leonhardt (bass), Thomas Nack (drums)*\u000a\u000aDespite dropping the story for the most part, Iron Savior has continued the sci-fi theme. On this album they also dropped the guitars to C#, a first for the band. Sielck's voice is a little harsher, for lack of a better word, on this album. The new guitar-centric sound continues on this album and it has a thick, full sound. Finally, the bass is brought up a little bit too which is great. The band also has a more mature, slightly darker sound here. This is likely in part due to the death of Sielck's brother in 2005, to whom the album is dedicated. It is a good album but I like a few of their other ones better.\u000a\u000a*Notable songs*\u000a\u000a[Megatropolis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tiE3fNavWw) (my personal favorite) sums up the new style well. The vocals are a little bit lower, the song is a little bit darker, and everything's tuned down to C#. The song is about one of the adventurers on the Thunderbird, returned to his home in Megatropolis.\u000a\u000a[Cybernetic Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLm69KLTnZg) is slow and dark. The bass's muddy tone is really, really good on this one.\u000a\u000aA really interesting bonus track on this album is [Iron Watcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iRmxqdqI38), a combination of the songs Iron Savior and Watcher in the Sky. \u000a\u000a**[The Landing (2011)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6F65D2A98B8FC5D6)**\u000a\u000a*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Joachim Küstner (guitar, backing vocals), **Jan Eckert (bass, backing vocals)**, Thomas Nack (drums)*\u000a\u000aThe separate intro track returns after a long absence, and it leads into the majestic [The Savior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj5oEXMTW38). The heavier guitar-centric sound continues on this album, and it is a return to the lighter sound/tone after Megatropolis. \u000a\u000a*Notable songs*\u000a\u000a[Hall of the Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbNhdaVdO2E) is a slightly slower song. It is sort of unique in that it tells a story of its own, supported by no other songs. Highly recommended.\u000a\u000a[R. U. Ready](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD7WOQqNQxc) is an homage to the music and bands that inspired Iron Savior.\u000a\u000aThe single most interesting part of this album to me is the cover of Underworld's [Underneath the Radar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ-IdrKsXdo). It is a completely different style from the original, but it works very well. \u000a\u000a**[Rise of the Hero (2014)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7L6Yv9k_sc)**\u000a\u000a*Lineup: Piet Sielck (guitar, vocals), Joachim Küstner (guitar, backing vocals), Jan Eckert (bass, backing vocals), Thomas Nack (drums)*\u000a\u000aStylistically this is a very similar album to the previous one, and is good but not quite as good as The Landing in my opinion. The band uses D tuning again, probably because that's also what they use when they play live. This album also shows a little bit more variety in the songs, with another out-of-genre cover of Dance with Somebody.\u000a\u000a*Notable songs*\u000a\u000a**Iron Warrior** (my personal favorite) is a pretty standard song musically, but that chorus is just great. I sing along with it almost every time I listen to it.\u000a\u000a**Dragon King** is Iron Savior's second standalone story song. Like the last one it's a little slower, and very good.\u000a\u000a**The Demon** is this album's slow song. It's very somber, similar to Before the Pain on the last album. This one has a harsh, sad chorus though. \u000a\u000a**My personal favorite song from each album:**\u000a\u000aIron Savior: Children of the Wasteland\u000a\u000aUnification: Eye to Eye\u000a\u000aDark Assault: Back Into the Light\u000a\u000aCondition Red: Mindfeeder\u000a\u000aBattering Ram: Starchaser\u000a\u000aMegatropolis: Megatropolis\u000a\u000aThe Landing: Underneath the Radar\u000a\u000aRise of the Hero: Iron Warrior\u000a\u000aAlbum overall: Dark Assault, because I got it at an important time in my life. The most popular choice for this is usually Unification or Condition Red.

V###Fazermint's favorite Power Metal releases: January  \u000aFellow warriors, I present to you my newest /r/PowerMetal project: Talking about my favorite releases of the past month!\u000a\u000aYou know me, I like making playlists. So, naturally, I've decided to maintain a playlist of all my favorite releases on the Power Metal scene. I'll be doing this for the entirety of 2015. Hot damn!\u000a\u000aIt's not a Fazermint post if I don't provide my own ultra-biased opinions. So you can find those below. Hot diggity!\u000a\u000aI'll even talk about a select few non-PM releases that I'm excited about, because... well, because I can! So let's get to it!\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Release highlights  \u000a\u000a[Playlist: Power Metal 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE1FmEyuepxiO3TkjfULAm-t3qw2Dh9cl)\u000a\u000a* **Angra**: *Secret Garden* - [Newborn Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wIqIRK5ynM) (Progressive Power Metal)  \u000a* **Orden Ogan**: *Ravenhead* - [F.E.V.E.R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZrT_w2TAIU) (Power Metal)  \u000a* **Serious Black**: *As Daylight Breaks* - [My Mystic Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBQyssSWmL8) (Power Metal)  \u000a* **Vexillum**: *Unum* - [Over the Clouds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B43V8xIgoCM) (Folk / Power Metal)  \u000a* **Visigoth**: *The Revenant King* - [Creature of Desire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I64M_04-m98) (Heavy / Power Metal)  \u000a* **Blind Guardian**: *Beyond the Red Mirror* - [Twilight of the Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep1B_aIFPDE) (Power Metal)  \u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Fazermint's ultra-biased opinions\u000a\u000a* **Angra**: Angra is posted frequently here on /r/PowerMetal, and is a top-tier PM band for many of us. I'm not very familiar with their stuff, but *Secret Garden* sounds like a quality outing. Angra is now fronted by Fabio Lione, the fabulous lion, who you know from Rhapsody of Fire among other things. Some of you may be sick of the guy, because he's *everywhere*. Well, not me! The lead single, "Newborn Me" is pretty awesome, showcasing that Fabio and progressive PM go well together. Great riffs throughout the song, great chorus, awesome acoustic guitar segment and kick-ass solo right after.  \u000a* **Orden Ogan**: I've recently fallen in love with Orden Ogan. "The Things we Believe In" and "To the End" are my go-to tracks right now. To hear that theres's a new release was a pleasant surprise. "F.E.V.E.R" sounds really good, with powerful and catchy vocals, great chorus, superb instrumentation with kick-ass guitars and some violins here and there (at least I think they are violins...?)  \u000a* **Serious Black**: Oh, hell yes! This is definitely my favorite song of the month. Serious Black is kind of a supergroup, but not really - they consider themselves a regular band, the fact that it is comprised of some serious starpower besides. We've got Urban Breed on vocals, Roland Grapow on guitars, and other well-established musicians. Grapow's influence is noticeable, as "Mystic Mind" sounds like it could have been a Masterplan song off the Aeronautics album. The melodic intro is awesome, and I can actually identify with the lyrics. Really really great, song of the month for me.  \u000a* **Vexillum**: I'm happy to expand my library of Power Folk, now Elvenking won't be so alone. I really like "Over the Clouds". Chris Bay provides vocals on this one, and he has been criticized. I can understand the criticisms, but it's not that bad. The melody is folky and catchy, and the vocals are as well. This song just puts a smile on my face. The folk instruments are well executed, and the guitar solo kills! The rest of the album sees guest musicians such as Hansi Kürch and Mark Boals. It's a pretty high-end production. \u000a* **Visigoth**: Most surprising release of the month? It just might be. The album is promoted with the song [Dungeon Master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oclDVweTR4). The instrumentation is nice and fast, and the guitars kick some serious ass! The vocalist is damn good, but I didn't like the vocals in this particular song. I was certainly intrigued, though, and dug further. I found the song "Creature of Desire" off their EP, which kicks way more ass. I uploaded the slightly remastered version of this song off the new album, *just for you, sexy bastards*.  \u000a* **Blind Guardian**: So yeah. I'm not a Blind Guardian fanboy. But holy schmuck, "Twilight of the Gods" is one magnificent track. It's the only Blind Guardian song I have really cared about, which is weird because I'm told it's fairly standard BG stuff. Subjectivity is fascinating. There's just something else about this track. I guess it's closer to my own personal notion of power metal, or something. It kicks so much ass.  \u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Non-PM spotlight  \u000aJust some random non-PM releases I'm excited about:\u000a\u000a* **Dracula**: *Swing of Death* - [Walking on Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9Gme_E8ZWk) (Hard Rock). This is the concept album collaboration of metal king Jørn Lande (Jorn) and guitarist/songwriter Trond Holter. Holter has worked with Jorn on his latest solo records, but is best known as the guitarist/songwriter of the Glam Rock band Wig Wam. [Holter rockin' it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US5NedSGPcA). As for the actual release, it's not really reminiscent of anything Jorn has done before. It's less heavy, there's a general influence of classical music, and some songs are duets with female vocalist Lena Fløitmoen. Holter's guitar solos are pretty smooth, generally less speed-oriented than you folks probably prefer. It's a pretty enjoyable album, but it's different than Jorn's usual stuff.  \u000a* **Level 10**: *Chapter 1* - [Cry no More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02NNqNocpY0) (Heavy Metal). Allen &amp; Lande may not be doing a release together, but they've both got a new release out this month. Level 10 is another new collaboration, this time between Russel Allen (Symphony X) and Mat Sinner (Primal Fear). This is a regular Heavy Metal album, and most of the tracks have a slight touch of soul music. Allen has a powerhouse of a voice, and the instrumentation is well done. I skimmed through it and it seems pretty decent, but also nothing to get all tingly about.  \u000a\u000a*****  \u000a[When I first checked out Twilight of the Gods](http://media.giphy.com/media/mO7zIWExMpWRG/giphy.gif)

VThis really hasn't been an issue in the past - until only the last few weeks, (and honestly even now) this subreddit self-regulated very well. We're a relatively small and respectful group. \u000a\u000aBut I think that all of us have noticed some recent developments in the subreddit. None of them have been too egregious, but if left unchecked have the potential to become much more problematic and detrimental to the community. Due to the small size of this sub, even heavily downvoted posts can end up on our frontpage, and now seems like the time to resolve this before it has the chance to get any worse. \u000a\u000a**/u/SpeakMouthWords** - Don't get me wrong - I think our mod and founder are doing a great job right now. But it's hard to tell how active you are with the low profile you keep. One person can't keep an eye on things around the clock, and without a few other people to bounce ideas off of, it can be hard for one person to know how to respond to specific situations and users in the best way. \u000a\u000aI know in the past there have been some threads about setting up weekly discussions, or updating the sidebar, etc. that didn't really get mod attention. That can be frustrating in a small community like this, when you aren't sure whether the mods disagree, don't care, or simply didn't even see the post. \u000a\u000aI'm sure there are several fantastic and mature Mighty Warriors (is that what we're calling ourselves?) who have been quietly contributing to the community that we could ask to step up. \u000a\u000aSo let's see what our community thinks about this idea. /u/SpeakMouthWords, I hope you see this, and can let us know your own thoughts, and how you envision this subreddit working and being run - now, and in the future.

Out of this week's releases, I'd recommend **Deus X Machina**, a pretty solid-sounding outing with a nice melodic property and some very decent riffs. It's a re-issue of their 2014 album, though.\u000a\u000aOn the plus side though, I found a nice little EP that I missed a couple of weeks back: **Nocturna**. These guys haven't got an album out yet, but this EP sounds promising. The vocalist has a slightly boyish voice, but it works. For a debut EP, these guys are pulling some serious tunes.\u000a\u000a/u/psychoconductor pointed me to **Ascendia**'s release last week. The preview track is pretty amazing. The instrumentation is pretty basic, but dat singer tho. Sadly, the rest of the album is meh.\u000a\u000a##/u/MadTheMad  \u000aThis week sucks and so I feel that I can't really recommend anything but if I had to, I'd recommend **Ascendia**'s song "At the End of it All", it's nothing new or amazing but it's a good song overall with a good voice behind it and symphonic elements that support rather than take over. They have another song ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdN2ywKo0ak)) but it's generic as fuck and it makes me wonder if the the album is worth buying. "At the End of it All" is definitely worth a check.\u000a\u000aHonorable mention goes to **Axemaster**'s return to form, they're pretty much retro old school and somehow they have this "...And Justice For All" vibe going on here with a production similar to early Anthrax. This is not Power Metal though, it's Heavy Metal with some groove here and there. An interesting weird song but it's just a different shot at the old.\u000a\u000a##/u/omegakingauldron  \u000aRecommendation pending\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a[When I finally gave the Noble Beast album a spin](http://new4.fjcdn.com/thumbnails/comments/Go+get+em+champ+_09aa74b5c1c13540b567393a2414e3d2.gif)

sVAny Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?
p688
VI need some help understanding where the fandom is. I discovered Rhapsody of Fire roughly 2 years ago and have been in love ever since, I mean what kind of Godly band can make music that NEVER gets old? That case of "I listened to a song so much that I hate it" just doesn't happen with this band.\u000a\u000aYet, I still don't know how famous they are, if they still do concerts, or where to find a damn fanbase. Reddit has everything, right? Well the Rhapsody of Fire subreddit has a single post from 5 years ago... Can anyone tell me firstly how famous they are, perhaps put it into some sort of comparison to a famous band, tell me whether or not they still tour or are even a band anymore, and where I can find somewhere to connect with fans?

VHey everybody! I've lurked this board and others and discovered a lot of music that I listen to daily. I realized that a lot of these were in Youtube videos and I had to then go find the music.\u000a\u000aI wanted to make a subreddit where we could all get together and share playlists for numerous genres and ideas and discover some new music together. \u000a\u000aSo I made /r/metalplaylists. It is still a work in progress but I hope it takes off with the power of metal/hardcore/punk.

sVAngra - Secret Garden (2014 Japan Release) - Track by Track First Impressions
p726
VFabio Lione in Angra seems like such a strange choice.  Also, I will be making more of an effort to shorten the first impressions of each track by leaving out or leaving a brief note on sections that are not much worth a mention (for not being poor or great).  Shit\u2019s hard.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**Disclaimer:**  I am in no way a professional reviewer of music; I am just giving my first impressions as a power metal fanatic for those who are wondering if they should pick up the album.  Feel free to offer advice and tips on how to improve this for the future.  \u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**Disclaimer 2:**  This is FIRST IMPRESSIONS, and I have found myself to be very picky lately.  If you feel this kind of music is your thing and I do not like it, do not feel bound by one man's unprofessional and shitty opinions.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**1) Newborn Me**\u000a\u000aInteresting industrial/orchestral introduction, I kinda like it.  The real music begins with epic, heavy riffing backed by some more orchestration.  The verse continues with the heavy riffing and some fast-paced vocals; Fabio sounds great to start things off.  The pre-chorus is a solid build up to the chorus (minus an annoying vocal tidbit on the word \u201cdespair\u201d).  The chorus has a really nice flow to it.  I did not care for it much when I first started listening to it, but as with a lot of Angra\u2019s music, you have to really listen to it a number of times before you start appreciating it fully.  After the second chorus comes a very neat instrumental section, but who are we kidding - this is Angra, of course they are going to do that well.  Heavy guitar play with Angra\u2019s fantastic drumming, which then leads into a bit of a boring acoustic section.  The solo is quite enjoyable; I love Angra\u2019s solos.  Overall, quite a good song, and well done to Fabio.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**2) Black Hearted Soul**\u000a\u000aMuch more of a power metal introduction to this song.  Choir into double bass, lead-guitar driven power metal - great introduction.  The verses are generic; nothing special.  They fit the fast power metal theme and the melody flows in a way which I feel I have heard many times before.  The pre-chorus flies by unnoticed, but into a great chorus.  This is a power metal chorus by all rights.  It has a catchy, soaring melody with nice backing vocals.  The choir comes back for more action after the chorus, followed by a fantastic instrumental section.  God damn Angra, I love your instrumentals.  The solo is quite enjoyable once again; a very melodic solo with a very pleasant sound; Angra has a such distinct sound in their solos.  Until the end this is your standard, furious Angra power metal song and they show they still know how to do it well, capable of holding the spot as an opener for albums such as *Rebirth* or *Temple of Shadows*.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**3) Final Light**\u000a\u000aStarting off very dark and brooding with the help of the heavy guitar riffing and atmospheric keyboards, this song has me intrigued right away.  The first verse lets go of the guitars while the atmosphere kicks it up another notch behind a fantastic sounding Fabio and more keyboards.  Unfortunately the chorus takes away from the atmosphere and flow of the song which is otherwise fantastic (and very\u2026 different).  The second verse is more of the same but with the guitars staying to enjoy the show; the verse sounds way more awesome without the guitar.  The solo is not as interested this time, but this is by Angra\u2019s standards.  The solos in this album are very reminiscent of the style of solos on Aurora Consurgens, which is not a bad thing at all.  This song could have been so much more if they dropped the guitars in the second verse as well, and if they put more care into crafting a chorus to maintain the atmosphere that the song was able to create in the beginning.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**4) Storm of Emotions**\u000a\u000aI am really digging this song. The introduction and verse are awesome and Fabio continues to sound phenomenal.  They continue their darker, brooding atmosphere (seems to be a thing since Aurora Consurgens), and my lord is this song doing it perfectly so far.  The chorus manages to be catchy while maintaining that atmosphere, which is impressive song writing.  The second chorus is worth mentioning. Bringing Fabio\u2019s vocals up a notch, it forces some of his higher notes, and he sounds great.  Rafael Bittencourt also gets some time on the vocals in this song, and he sounds great.  I wish he would sing more.  Honestly, I prefer his voice more than Fabio\u2019s, even after the short section he is in.  There are also some choirs near the end that are worth mentioning; catchy while maintaining the brooding atmosphere.  I love Angra\u2019s ability to do this.  I imagine this song getting more spins with me in the future for sure, but it requires a certain mood to really get into it.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**5) Violet Sky**\u000a\u000aI am going to assume this is Rafael again.  Regardless of who it is, he sounds great.  The chorus was awkward, though; and lacking compared to the verse.  I do not think of Angra while listening to this song.  Very experimental piece.  I feel this song will be forgotten.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**6) Secret Garden**\u000a\u000aSimone Simons!  I wish there were male vocals in this song as well.  Oh well; Simone is as enjoyable as she always is, being one of the few female vocalists I like.  She definitely adds the Simone touch to this song, and it sounds great with Angra\u2019s writing.  This is a fairly orchestrated piece, which is interesting to hear from Angra.  Everything about this song is catchy.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**7) Upper Levels**\u000a\u000aAhh, I found the song with the Brazilian-influenced introduction.  As per usual it is enjoyable, though definitely not on par with other album\u2019s correspondents.  After listening to the verse and chorus, this song feels like filler, which is not common with Angra.  It sounds like a combination of the songs so far from this album while not being as good as any of them.  About midway there is a really nice vocal section (assuming by Rafael again) that is very reminiscent of the unique vocal passage in one of my favorite Angra songs \u201cThe Shadow Hunter\u201d.  This is the only part of the song that I really care for.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**8) Crushing Room**\u000a\u000aHeavy riffing introduction between brief dark piano sections.  Exactly the kind of thing I expected (and desired) from the song title.  The verse was nice, but the rest was forgettable.  I could do without this female vocalist.  Doro Pesch is her name, and I do not like her much.  I suppose there is a reason I have never heard of her until this song.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**9) Perfect Symmetry**\u000a\u000aSecond double bass song of the album.  In a way, it is disappointing to have to type that at track 9.  Sounds absolutely fantastic to start off, though.  Angra needs to go back to this.  No other band has done it like they have (besides Age of Artemis\u2019 first album, which was also pretty good).  This song is definitely the most uplifting song.  Angra seems to not be trying with the verses of their double bass songs on this album.  They just want to get to the chorus, I suppose.  Black Hearted Soul had better vocal melodies in the chorus, but I quite enjoy the keyboards in the chorus of this song.  After the second chorus comes one of the best parts of the album, an absolutely phenomenal orchestral section.  At this point I now realize Angra\u2019s next album needs to be a symphonic power metal venture.  Just do it, please Angra.  Just once.  With your own Angra touch.  I digress\u2026 the solo is a bit generic, unfortunately.  The song ends with another short orchestral section, and it is great once again.  I imagine I will come back to this song to check it out again, but first impressions are there is not much to keep me coming back besides those orchestral parts.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**10) Silent Call**\u000a\u000aI guess the closest thing Angra has done to this song is Lease of Life?  Even then, it sounds quite a bit different than that - quite a bit different than any Angra.  There is no Fabio singing once again - I find it kind of funny how little singing he has done on this album.  This song is forgettable.  The vocals by Rafael are fantastic but it is a bit cheesy and I feel like I have heard songs like this many times before.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aAngra is such a dark band now; so much different than the Andre Matos era and the beginning of the Edu Falaschi era.  The production of this album is great, and it has some great parts, but overall, it does not come close to the glory of *Angels Cry* or *Temple of Shadows*.  Bands are allowed to change, and there is nothing wrong with that, but I think with a bit more care this album could have been fantastic.  As it stands from first impressions, I would say it is good; nothing more, nothing less.  A step up from Aqua, although nothing reaches the awesomeness of \u201cArising Thunder\u201d.

I thought it was neat. I was really in the mood for some fast power when I listened to this, so I pretty much got what I asked for. They seem like a fairly solid band overall.\u000a\u000aAs for last week, turns out I missed that PelleK released his new album. I know /u/realkman666 and /u/mushmancat are extremely pumped for this, go [buy your signed copy here](http://pellek.com/).\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a**Highlight of the Week**\u000a\u000aYou all know Epica. Simone Simons is all over the place on the metal scene, and they have built up quite a name for themselves. In May this year they released their seventh full-length album. I listened to Design Your Universe a bit back in the days, but haven't really caught up with them entirely. In my quest for epic instrumentals, I found one on their recent album. [That shit's majestic](http://youtu.be/Mc9p4N8QBaw). They promoted the album, _The Quantic Enigma_, with a partly progressive, heavy and occasionally epic tune called [The Essence of Silence](http://youtu.be/oePrtEMmX9Y).

p761
VSo doing the year end best of\u2019s got me in the mood for lists and I finally finished up something I started earlier in the year when it became apparent that all I had left in life was arguing about power metal with strangers over the internet.  Anyway, I wanted to do my top three power metal albums from each year. I\u2019m sure no one really cares, but this took more time than I care to admit, so I\u2019m going to share it anyway. \u000a\u000aI decided to start in 1983, because there wasn't much going on before then in terms of power metal.  Also, this list seems to be constantly changing, so if you feel like i've left something out, let me know. There is a good chance i've forgotten some proper albums. \u000a\u000a**1983**- No Competition here, Crystal Logic runs away with it. \u000a\u000aManilla Road- Crystal Logic\u000a\u000aSavatage- Sirens\u000a\u000aManowar- Into Glory Ride\u000a\u000a__________________________________________________________\u000a\u000a**1984** - Metal Church gets 1984 by the narrowest of margins.

sVState of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing
p799
VI have been thinking about the state of /r/PowerMetal at this current time.  I become more annoyed every time I visit this subreddit.  Note:  I have no plans to leave and no big dramatic post that I will regret later because I will come back anyways (ahem, you know who you are!  &lt;3).  However, it would be nice to get this place cleaned up a bit.  Maybe some moderation could start happening as well, as there never has been much of that - trolling and completely non-power metal posts have always slipped by.  There are two main issues at the moment.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**1) Trolling**  \u000a\u000aI am not sure what the rules are against calling out.  Are the rules for all of Reddit or do they depend on the subreddit?  I do not care.  Either way, I am going to do it, because we are a small community with many known members.  Realkman666's trolling has gotten frustrating for a number of people.  This is a message to him and possibly mods.  I do not know why you have started this trolling - if I recall correctly you have been around for awhile and this only is a recent thing.  Is it because the PelleK bashing got on your nerves?  I can understand that to a degree.  But there are better ways to deal with it.  Your comments add nothing and your constant PelleK posts are obviously nothing more than trolls.  There is nothing wrong with posting PelleK but we all know you are feeding this PelleK hate on purpose.  Just look at the titles of your posts.  You know what you're doing.  I was hoping you'd stop, or maybe moderators could take action.\u000a\u000a**EDIT:** I forgot to mention - stop downvoting Realkman666 no matter what he posts!  That is immaturity at its finest.  Downvote him if he is being toxic or being a troll, sure.  If he is not, then stop being an idiot.  There is no value in doing that kind of thing.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a**2) PelleK Bashing**\u000a\u000aThis needs to stop.  There is no need to state how much he sucks every post or at what point you stopped listening to the linked song.  Here are some things I think needed to be pointed out:  firstly, he is a better singer than almost everyone here.  Guaranteed.  He loves power metal and is really putting it out there in his own way.  Honestly, it is pretty cool.  And give it to the guy - he has quite a few good videos.  I personally do not like where he has gone with them for the past while; he used to have a much nicer voice.  But maybe it is simply not for everyone.  Check out his work with Damnation Angels, or his Christmas album if that is your kind of thing (while it is not mine, it is actually really well done).  Secondly, there is a point where it becomes too much and it is almost a form of bullying: simply being mean while offering nothing constructive and offering no intelligent discussion  I am pretty sure he has posted here in the past, though maybe my memory fails me.  If he did, I am sure he would not want to again.  Get over yourselves.  Enough with it; stop being dicks.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aThat is about all I wanted to say.  Hopefully people will take this to heart, especially Realkman666.  Too much trolling, silliness and drama.  Let's keep it power metal.  Bring back healthy discussion instead of this toxicity.

First off, I would like to recommend **Winterage**, which I somehow missed last week. It's Luca Turilli-esque Symphonic Power, and it sounds very awesome. The preview track has a slight overuse of high-pitched screams though.\u000a\u000aAs for this week's releases, I recommend checking out **Tanagra**, **Adrenaline Mob**, and **Lords of the Trident**. Tanagra sounds like a very interesting debut album, and that album art is GORGEOUS. Adrenaline Mob is recommended for fans of Russel Allen. This EP seems to be a mix of a few tracks from their previous album along with some new cover songs. Eh, why not? Lastly, Lords of the Trident should definitely be checked out. The album art is cool, and the lyric video has tons of explosions and flames. Oh, and the song is cool.\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a[When I accidentally listen to a Black Metal song, thinking it was a Power Metal band](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/profiles/icons/big/000/203/182/515.gif)\u000a\u000aAre you interested in writing weekly release threads on a rotational basis?

p828
VThese aren't in any order, but I do have one disc of the year.\u000a\u000a[Edguy - Space Police](http://youtu.be/NXByLCwYKW8?list=PLNcioWfkdxJiB0x454m26BcC8-LzGhrxm)\u000a\u000aI really haven't liked pretty much anything they've done since Rocket Ride. I felt they went really off the rails on a hair metal train going straight to shittown. There was absolutely nothing memorable about them. I didn't have high hopes for this album, but to my surprise I just kept hitting the repeat button. It still doesn't hold a candle to their older work, but it's nice to know that Edguy does know how to right good melodic metal given the right circumstances.\u000a\u000a[Equilibrium - Erdentempel](http://youtu.be/vPNOIK_kBx4?list=PLEFNRJ3-oh8c9OFMnSPwOCOLoDxPAYgDp)\u000a\u000aThese guys are the current kings of viking metal. Their last album was fucking brilliant and somehow they achieved brilliance again with their latest outing. The rhythm section is top notch, the orchestrations soar, and the vocalist doesn't just warble incoherently over a background noise. Most of the time in black/death metal the vocalist just adds to the noise. This guy follows a rhythm and follows the music and let's it become important.\u000a\u000a[Threshold - For The Journey](http://youtu.be/ToYSRker8UM)\u000a\u000aThey seem to have settled into a comfortable pace. They haven't really changed their sound since Dead Reckoning, but I find it hard to argue when their music is just so fucking good. They are top tier prog metal. Damian Wilson is a powerhouse of a vocalist.\u000a\u000a[Scar Symmetry - The Singularity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NsFx6iVOaA)\u000a\u000aThis is the best disc they've done since they lost Christian. Anyone looking to dip into the melodic death genre a la Soilwork should start here. They have the lushest melodies this side of progpower.\u000a\u000a[Evergrey - Hymns For The Broken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK0G74RcIBM)\u000a\u000aEvergrey is like Edguy in the fact that their last few albums have been totally lackluster. The Glorious Collision was in the right direction but still lacking. This disc puts them right back where they belong and it sounds like a logical follow-up to The Inner Circle, which was their last good disc until this showed up.\u000a\u000a[Viathyn - Cynosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDL26Jl-Vt4)\u000a\u000aI just fucking love when a rookie band comes from nowhere and releases a stellar album. The Falconer influence is everywhere and that's a good thing. \u000a\u000a[Adamantra - Act II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNxldP3qptY)\u000a\u000aThese guys if you didn't know rose from the ashes of Bride Adorned. Bride Adorned put out one of the finest symphonic metal albums ever made IMO. I'm glad they basically kept a lot of what was good from BA and transferred it to another band. The Finns as usual have top notch production sensibilities which helps considered the layers upon layers of nuances in every song.\u000a\u000a[Sabaton - Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHg5LW3R3Pg)\u000a\u000aYou all knew this was going to be here. They've been on every list I've done since they started releasing superb quality albums (starting with The Art of War, I felt everything before that was spotty). Night Witches is a fucking blazer of an opener. Anyone who hears this song first is instantly sold on the album. I could go on and on about this album being amazing, but I'll just leave it with my only gripe being that the album is a tad short!\u000a\u000a[Voyager - V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZqx-zirNf4)\u000a\u000aTheir jump to djent was not without it's missteps, but it's ultimately a quality album. It's not as good as the masterful Meaning of I, but it's rare when a band is album to match something like that. Go listen to the song [Broken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EkU3tMs4c) and you'll see what I mean. Don't let that deter you, dive right in and be amazed with talent of constructing a captivating melody, along with having the distinction of having no one else sounding like them.\u000a\u000aDISC OF THE YEAR\u000a\u000a[Dynazty - Renatus](http://youtu.be/LlXBwsgcQ70?list=PLm2qJi599_Q12Y9NEGHZEsm2wWEX00gxp)\u000a\u000aThese guys were amazing AOR/Hard Rock anyways, but then they decided "fuck it, let's get faster, heavier, and better". And they did! They genre jumped like fucking champs making it look easy and like they have been doing it all their lives. After hearing Starlight it immediately got added to my gym playlist. Hell, if you need motivation to get shit done throw this album in the player and go do a few more sets. \u000a\u000a\u000a

VHis last comment was 12 days. He still hasn't posted the 2014 Awards nominees. He won't reply to my messages (albeit I sent it 24 hours ago).\u000a\u000aI know this sub doesn't demand a whole lot of active moderation, but that doesn't mean he should be absent 250 days of the year. So my question is does anyone know /u/SpeakMouthWords personally and know what he's up to? Furthermore, I think it's about time we get a second mod. We're at the point where the oldest post on the frontpage is roughly 24 hours old, and with the upcoming Blind Guardian AMA, I think we'll need the manpower to make sure this subreddit stays well-oiled.\u000a\u000aJust to make it clear, I'm absolutely not advocating we overthrow him or get a replacement. I think we need a second mod. And not me either; I've already overstayed my welcome by waiting for this 2014 Awards thing. But I can't be the only one a little frustrated that the one fallback that a subreddit needs is one that we don't have.

p890
V###Discovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Pt. 1: 2001 - 2008)\u000aFellow warriors, welcome to the Avantasia write-up that I promised *last week*! It's late, since I decided to first redo my favorite releases post for January. Because of space constraints, this Avantasia write-up has to be covered in two separate posts. This first part covers *The Metal Opera* part 1 and 2, both parts of *Lost in Space*, and *The Scarecrow*. The second part, covering the last three albums, should arrive in a couple of days.\u000a\u000aBefore we begin, I want to make clear that I'm in no way an expert on Power Metal or on music. I'm just a guy who's passionate about this genre of music and like to write / discuss about it. My reviews of bands are, ultimately, subjective endeavors. Your own opinion is not guaranteed to be represented in my writings, but you are welcome and encouraged to share your own opinions in the comments! Most of you are already aware of this, but I wanted to reiterate it before writing about one of the genre's most beloved bands.\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###About the band  \u000a**Genre**: Symphonic Power Metal  \u000a**Country**: Germany\u000a\u000aAvantasia is the prime example of a Power Metal supergroup. The project is the brainchild of Tobias Sammet, vocalist and primary songwriter of **Edguy**. Sammet is the main vocalist of Avantasia, appearing on most (*if not all*) songs. Avantasia also has an incredible line-up of guest vocalists. Many big names in metal has visited the Avantasia club at one point or another. Drawing a comparison to Edguy, which produces album after album with awesome, funny and catchy Power Metal, Avantasia is more down-to-earth and serious.\u000a\u000aOriginally, Sammet planned for Avantasia to be a one-off project, consisting only of the *Metal Opera* albums. That explains the void between *The Metal Opera Pt. 2* in 2002 and *Lost in Space* in 2007 - It took about 5 years before Sammet decided to make Avantasia a permanent Power Metal act. And we're all glad he did. Avantasia has been putting out albums regularly ever since, and according to Wikipedia, Sammet said that the latest album, *The Mystery of Time*, will definitely have a sequel.

Kiske). The verses smash you in the face with awesomeness, but sadly the chorus is much less catchy and kinda breaks the pace. "Serpents in Paradise" (ft. David DeFeis) is another great track, with a sweet intro guitar riff and great vocals, and a pretty happy-vibe chorus even though the song name would suggest otherwise.  \u000aThe best song on the album, in my opinion, is "**Glory of Rome**". This one has THREE guest vocalists: Oliver Hartmann, Ralf Zdiarstek and Rob Rock. I'm not familiar with these specific vocalist and it's difficult to tell which one does which segments. Whoever sings the segment from 0:47 - 1:08 is awesome, though! Good, speedy riffs and drums accentuate the song perfectly. This is a real classic!  \u000aThe rest of the album is more or less forgettable in my opinion. The album finisher, "The Tower", has Kiske, Hartmann and DeFeis, as well as Timo Tolkki and Andre Matos. Are you sure you have enough vocalists there, Sammet!? The song is okay-ish, but can't really keep my interest for its 9 minute duration. \u000a\u000a##Part 2 (2002)  \u000aThe album opens with "The Seven Angels", which is 14 minutes long. It has its good moments, but it's not really good enough to keep my interest for the entirety of the song's length, and it changes pace too much. Track #2 is "No Return" (ft. Kiske and Matos), which is the first noteworthy song. The guitar intro is decent enough, and the instrumentation is good throughout the song. The vocals start off in a standard fashion (so far as *The Metal Opera* is concerned), but smashes you in the face with the most memorable vocal segment on both of these albums: 0:48 - 0:59. *Until the morning light, illuminate the night, be the light on our side*. It returns at 2:15 - 2:24, and even in guitar solo form at 3:15 - 3:25. Even so, I still wish there would be more of it, it's so darn catchy whereas the rest of the vocals are *just okay*.  \u000aFrom then on, the album consists of mostly forgettable tracks (again, *in my opinion*), broken off with "The Final Sacrifice" in between. David DeFeis returns as a guest vocalist here. The song's pretty badass, with heavy riffs and rough-y vocals that are maybe a little over the top at some points. I like it though!  \u000aNear the end we reach the final noteworthy song of the album: "**Memory**". Ralf Zdiarstek returns here, and man, I've never heard of this guy before but he's the best thing to happen to these albums. I suspect he's the one that has that super awesome segment in "Glory of Rome" as well. "Memory" has a nifty guitar riff going on, and this song has one of the coolest guitar solos on the *Metal Opera* albums. The second verse, between 2:06 and 2:40, is incredible.\u000a\u000a##Conclusion (*The Metal Opera*)\u000a*The Metal Opera* marks the beginning of something fantastic. Both albums have their own gems, most notably "The Glory of Rome" from part 1 and "Memory" from part 2. The first one is decidedly the most solid album of the two, as is evident by its spot in our Essential albums list. The albums are largely similar in style, yet vastly different from later Avantasia albums. Personally, I prefer the style of the later albums. Another testament to how my opinion differs from the norm! YAY ME!  \u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Lost in Space (2007)  \u000aIn 2007, Avantasia returned with two separate EPs titled Lost in Space (Part 1 and 2 respectively). The EPs are obviously centered around the single "Lost in Space", which is featured a total of three times across both EPs. The original single is featured on both EPs, and Part 2 also has a live version. PLS LIKE LOST IN SPACE PLS. Both EPs also has two cover songs, as well as 2-3 new songs.\u000a\u000a##Part 1\u000a"Lost in Space" immediately showcases the shift in style from *The Metal Opera*: It is less speed-oriented, the vocals are more prominent and focal in the mix, and naturally the recording quality is a bit higher. The titular track is a generally calm song, focusing more on melody and vocals than on instrumentation. Basically, it's not a Power Metal track. Because of that, the song is more accessible to the general public, which probably helped for promotional purposes. I like it, but would hardly consider it an essential Avantasia song.  \u000aThe next track is an ABBA cover. I don't care about ABBA songs at all, but dammit, this one really works in Power Metal form! Or well, it is mostly the verses that sound good. They are more speed-based than the chorus, which makes it fit better with Power Metal.  \u000aThen we get to an original song, "**Another Angel Down**". Wait, who's the guest vocalist here? Modda fokkin JORN, that's who. Okay so Jorn is my favorite vocalist and I may sound biased as hell, but this is easily the best track across both EPs. Not only because Jorn is there, but also because of the nifty intro guitar riff and the overall instrumentation.  \u000a"The Story ain't Over" is a forgettable ballad. "Ride the Sky" is a Lucifer's Friend cover, which has the drummer (Eric Singer) doing part of the vocals. It's a pretty enjoyable song, I guess.\u000a\u000a##Part 2\u000aAlso this EP starts off with the titular track, followed by an original song called "Promised Land". There are two guest vocalists here: Jorn and Kiske. Hearing so many great vocalist in one track is pretty awesome. The song is very nice, but I consider it less essential than "Another Angel Down".  \u000aAnd then, just because he could, Sammet did a cover of "Dancing with Tears in my Eyes" by Ultravox. Pretty weird... and it actually sounds all right.  \u000aNext up is an original song, "Scary Eyes", which is decent but forgettable. It is followed by a cover of "In my Defense" by Freddie Mercury. Great, more ballads... And if you REALLY want to, you can listen to the last track which is a live recording of "Lost in Space". To make it even more exciting, it's ACOUSTIC! WOO... oo.\u000a\u000a##Conclusion (*Lost in Space*)  \u000aThe *Lost in Space* EPs were effectively building up the release of the next album, *The Scarecrow*. Both the titular track and "Another Angel Down" are featured on that album as well. The EPs may still be worth checking out because of some unique tracks such as "Promised Land".\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###The Scarecrow (2008)  \u000aThis album marks the beginning of the contemporary musical style of Avantasia, although it was already sampled in the *Lost in Space* EPs. *The Scarecrow* is part of *The Wicked Symphony* trilogy, consisting of this album and two albums released simultaneously in 2010.  \u000aGetting right to it, the album is opened by "Twisted Mind" (ft. Roy Khan). This song is pretty great, and you should definitely check it out. It has kind of a creepy vibe, which is what they were going for judging by the song title.  \u000aThe second track is the title track, "**The Scarecrow**". This song is 11 minutes long and I usually have a bit of a gripe with longer tracks, but this one is fantastic. With the exception of a nonsensical pause in the pace between 4:15 - 6:15, this song is awesome through and through. The sweet violin intro is supported by tribe-like drums (in lack of a better term), soon accentuated with symphonic elements. The pace of the song is generally slow, but it's a powerful track despite that fact. Sammet sounds incredibly epic here. *There's a voice and a million answers to the questions I don't ask*. And oh yeah, Jorn is back! He starts singing the second verse. There's so much awesomeness packed into this song, and the melody is really memorable. As I mentioned, the pace is broken for two minutes, before it returns with more awesomeness.  \u000aThe title track is followed by "Shelter from the Rain" (ft. Kiske), which I found to be decent but forgettable. Then we have "Carry me Over", which was released in single form before. It's another ballad, and while I enjoy the occasional ballad, this one is skippable. Speaking of ballads, "What Kind of Love" (ft. Amanda Somerville) is another one.  \u000a"Another Angel Down" makes a return. After that, we've got Alice Cooper on "The Toy Master". This is another song with a creepy vibe. You do have to like Alice Cooper to like this track. Next up is "**Devil in the Belfry**" (ft. Jorn), which is one of the most explosive tracks on the album. Sammet and Jorn are a deadly duo, which this track is an excellent example of. Alternating lines works really well, and the chorus is incredible. Jorn bias much? Maybe... what can ya do.  \u000aIf you didn't get enough ballads, you can listen to "Cry Just a Little". The final original song on the album is "I Don't Believe in your Love" (ft. Oliver Hartmann). This one's pretty great as well. Intriguingly, Sammet is fine with singing "Don't give a fuck", whereas Hartmann prefers "Don't give a damn". The album finishes with "Lost in Space" for good measure.\u000a\u000a*****  \u000a###Conclusion (Part 1)  \u000a**TL;DR**: Check out these songs: "The Glory of Rome", "Memory", "Another Angel Down", "The Scarecrow" and "Devil in the Belfry".\u000a\u000aPart two should be on its way. I'd promise to have it out by Friday, but something always seems to come up and I end up delaying stuff... I'll try though!

sVA Beginner's Guide to Heavenly
p913
VHeavenly was an unexpected decision for my second guide - unlike with Sonata Arctica, which I had known and loved for years, I have only discovered Heavenly in the last few months, after joining this subreddit. But they have quickly become one of my all-time favorite power metal bands, and I figured I might as well put my recent obsession with them to good use. \u000a\u000aHeavenly, so far as I can tell, occupies a bit of an odd space in the Power Metal scene. They are not often talked about or mentioned as one of the "greats", and yet everyone who has heard of them seems to absolutely love at least a part of their discography. Through my research it has become clear why some of the albums I adore are not as well loved by others, but the general consensus across the board is that their album *Dust to Dust* is as deserving of a place on the sidebar as anything there. \u000a\u000a**Note: For those new to Heavenly, I suggest starting with their album Dust to Dust and on, which is when they really come into their own. Their earlier work is somewhat lackluster, and eminently skippable, though with some definite merits.**\u000a\u000a**Some History:** \u000aBased in Marseille, France, this band began in 1993 as a cover band under the name "Satan's Lawyer", started by lead singer Benjamin Sotto and drummer Max Pilo. By 1994 they had morphed into a full fledged power metal band in their own right, heavily influenced by Helloween and Gamma Ray, among others. After the usual member shuffle and a short demo (which got them signed to label Noise Records), the lineup looked like this: Benjamin Sotto (Vocals), Max Pilo (Drummer), Chris Savourey (Guitar) and Laurent Jean (Bass). While most often categorized as power metal, the discerning ear will note heavy classical and progressive influences (and maybe even some Queen...) \u000a \u000a[**2000: Coming from the Sky**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7h9GOxYyKY)\u000a\u000a**lineup: Benjamin Sotto, Chris Savourey, Laurent Jean, Maxence Pilo, Charley Corbiaux**\u000a\u000aThough a solid debut, Heavenly had not yet developed their utterly unique style, and many reviews deride this album as somewhat derivative. Often compared to Gamma Ray, Iron Savior, and late 80s Helloween (almost all reviews mention Benjamin Sotto's vocal resemblance to Michael Kiske) this album is significantly different tonally and stylistically from what they would later evolve into. Despite these failings, this album was well received by the metal community. \u000a\u000a*The Fan Favorite:*: [Riding Through Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNer2g5D6D4): The best song off the album. A bit slow to get started, but full of strong vocals and rocking instrumentals. \u000a\u000a*My Tops*:\u000a\u000a1. [Time Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0WqZratZhQ): Featuring the frontmen of Gamma Ray and Iron Savior, it is perhaps no surprise that this song brings both those bands to mind. The vocally layered chorus is one of the most sing-able off the album. \u000a\u000a**Between Albums:** \u000a \u000aBassist Larent Jean departs and is replaced by Pierre-Emmanuel Pélisson. In addition, Frédéric Leclercq is added on keyboards originally, before replacing Chris Savourey on guitar. \u000a\u000a[**2001: Sign of the Winner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1l6GXzFAoI)\u000a\u000a**Lineup: Benjamin Sotto, Frédéric Leclercq, Pierre-Emmanuel Pélisson, Maxence Pilo, Charley Corbiaux**\u000a\u000aOnce again, some of the key critical terms when referring to this album are - "derivative", "done before", "sounds like"... Heavenly delivers here a solid album, but too clearly influenced by other bands and not yet displaying enough of their own unique style. \u000a\u000a*The Fan Favorite*: [Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymfrq4RrFtU): With an instrumental theme that kicks off from the last note and lasts until the song trails out, and merges into the main vocals, this is probably the best song off the album, by quite a margin. \u000a\u000a*My Tops*:\u000a\u000a1. [Break the Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBY-i3fm0qM): The first song of the album, this is a 4 minute instrumental introduction, that I find myself listening to more often than any of the other songs. While it can be a bit repetitive in segments, it developed several themes I keep coming back to hear over and over. \u000a\u000a2. [The Sandman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMunUMf2a8A): Vocally layered with an interesting musical theme, this song is worth your time. \u000a\u000a[**2004: Dust to Dust**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOp-Akk59sE)\u000a\u000a**Lineup: Benjamin Sotto, Frédéric Leclercq, Pierre-Emmanuel Pélisson, Maxence Pilo, Charley Corbiaux**\u000a\u000aThis album is where Heavenly really comes into their own, finally moving from a more cookie cutter sound to something totally new and all theirs. While there is still some merit to be found in earlier albums, most fans tend to stick with this album and later ones. The jump in quality here is nearly unbelievable - from their somewhat lackluster earlier work, to what is one of the best power metal albums I've ever heard. \u000a\u000a*Dust to Dust* is a concept album about a man seeking revenge against his master, the vampire who turned him and caused his eternal damnation.  \u000a\u000a*The Fan Favorite*: [Miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUB4Wvo2suw): Strident guitar solos over piano melodies, fading into and out of each other. Almost hymnal vocals giving way to heartfelt wails. This song is a revelation in and of itself, mirroring the one found in this song by the album's protagonist. Power metal doesn't get much better than this. \u000a\u000a*My Tops:*\u000a\u000a1. [Evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IEX7U-Ht2U): Quickly establishes a fast rhythm and simple melody, which soon builds up to one of my favorite choruses of all time. *"Glory, to the miracle..."*\u000a\u000a2. [Victory (Creature of the Night)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gts4hv99FVA): Beginning with a wonderful piano melody under Sotto's vocals, this song then wanders through several musical themes before finally finding its refrain. But this is not a song getting lost, but instead exploring new territory, in such a way that you can't help but to travel with it. \u000a\u000a**Between Albums**\u000a\u000aFrédéric Leclercq, Max Pilo, and Pierre-Emmanuel Pélisson depart, to be replaced by Thomas Das Neves (drums), Olivier Lapauze (guitar), and Matthieu Plana (Bass). \u000a\u000a[**2006: Virus**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRvoaq6KYtI)\u000a\u000a**Lineup: Benjamin Sotto, Olivier Lapauze, Matthieu Plana, Thomas Das Neves, Charley Corbiaux**\u000a\u000aThis album only continues the band's upwards trend. Virus is their most popular album, and the one most quoted by fans as their absolute favorite. Full of brilliant vocals and rich instrumentals, it is this album that helps cement Heavenly at the top of the power metal genre. Nevertheless, there are fans that hold that nothing after *Dust to Dust* was able to reach that same height, and that *Virus* once again relies too much on Heavenly's influences. \u000a\u000a*The Fan Favorite*: [Virus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6ZJP1QyeBo): Starts right in with the heavy guitars, melding it with dark vocals and all moving towards a fantastic chorus. *"Just remember the man you used to be..."*\u000a\u000a*My Tops*:\u000a\u000a1. [Spill Blood on Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE8XoLzDEFs): One of those songs you can never seem to get out of your head... \u000a\u000a2. [The Dark Memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LelYBwaJKZo): Moody and full of rich instruments and vocals, this song hits home. \u000a\u000a[**2009: Carpe Diem**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0ZAwvfnYvQ)\u000a\u000a**NOTE: ALL the links from this album (including the full album link above) are NSFW, due to the album artwork.**\u000a\u000a**Lineup: Benjamin Sotto, Olivier Lapauze, Matthieu Plana, Thomas Das Neves, Charley Corbiaux**\u000a\u000aDespite a [cover (NSFW)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Heavenly_-_Carpe_Diem.jpg) you'd hate to be seen in public with, Heavenly only continues their upward trend with this album. Fans seem to either love or hate this album depending on what they're looking for - while fans of the Gamma Ray clone are (mostly) disappointed, there are others who love the new elements this album brings to the table (not least among them an obvious tonal and instrumental similarity to Queen). The vocals really take the frontline in this album, with many great refrains and layered harmonies. This was the album that introduced me to Heavenly, and comes a close second (behind Dust to Dust) in my personal rating of their discography. \u000a\u000a*The Fan Favorite*: [Carpe Diem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu2V_Ea5UgU): Guitar solos vie for control with a rich chorus, and the song is the only one who wins. \u000a\u000a*My Tops:* \u000a\u000a1. [Lost In Your Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8citLM_uR8Q): Jumping straight into a fantastic melody, the guitars push the song all the way to fantastic chorus. \u000a\u000a2. [Fullmoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwcutxyxjI4): *"She should not lock the open door..."* Just joking. The instruments hold up the vocals, all melding together in a chorus that will have you singing along just as much as any other FullMoons might. \u000a\u000a**What's Next?** \u000a\u000aDespite several years without the release of new material, Heavenly has made claims on their Facebook page that they are working on and planning to record a new album, though it is unclear at this point where the project stands.

sVThought experiment: What if Michael Jackson had sung power metal?
p931
VI have a recurring train of thought that goes something like this:\u000a\u000aI lament/wonder about the general (though not complete) dearth of black people in heavy metal, especially given that perhaps the most important guitarist in establishing the genre was black. I think how it'd be sort of interesting (if tokenist) if a power-metal band had a black frontman, Killswitch Engage style. I think, well, at least stereotypically, I think of black male singing voices as being more often bass and baritone than typical power-metal tenor. And then I remember Michael Jackson, probably the most famous tenor/countertenor in all of popular music. And I wonder...\u000a\u000aHow would Jackson's voice have translated to a power-metal band? He sung high enough, for sure, and he had the energy... Would it have worked? Totally a random thought process, but it intrigued me enough to want others' opinions.\u000a\u000a(Also, I think someone really needs to do a power-metal cover of "Thriller.")

For fans of folk metal with unclean vocals, **Ensiferum** seems to have pretty kick-ass instrumentation. Also, if you liked **Scanner**'s release back in January, a music video has since dropped for the title track of the album. The symphonic (power) metal enthusiast in me was excited to check out *Whyzdom* and *Lapis Lazuli*, but I found both cases to be quite uninteresting, honestly.\u000a\u000aThe new **Nightwish** single for Élan dropped yesterday, so if you haven't yet, check it out! The song is calm and beautiful, and Floor sounds fantastic. I do, however, hope for heavier and speedier tracks on the actual album. The single release had a bonus track, [Sagan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq-qQRLjEJM), which is slightly speedier. Even though these two tracks aren't really what I, and bet most of you, expect from the album, I'm still confident that the album will contain one or two hard-hitting tracks to stand above the currently known songs.\u000a\u000aI've toyed around somewhat with the link format, putting indicative names on the links instead of calling everything a preview. Tell me which style you prefer. Also, /u/Phyralis has expressed interest in helping out with the weekly releases. I asked about it and haven't heard from him yet, but hopefully he'll join me soon. \u000a\u000a*****  \u000a[MFW upvote count for new Nightwish single](http://new4.fjcdn.com/gifs/When+you+notice+the+new+alert+icon_9a8fb0_5453126.gif)

sVIdea for a community project: Themed "mixtape" videos
p976
VLately I've been toying around with the idea of creating YouTube videos consisting of a number of same-themed songs. You know, not an actual video in terms of animating stuff or whatever, just with the album art of the song currently playing and random images relating to the theme (not like people sit and watch these things anyway).\u000a\u000aI've been planning to do one centered around Fairyland's "Score to a New Beginning", i.e. "serene" power metal. I've been looking for songs with the same sonic vibe rather than focusing on lyrics, but maybe it's an idea to use lyrics as themes, too. So far I've found [Revolution Renaissance - Into the Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5seLcRVJ6o) and Symphony X's "When All is Lost" and/or "Paradise Lost", although the latter two have pretty dramatic lyrics.\u000a\u000aSo if people are interested, we could make this into a thing. People can suggest themes or make their own, and we collaborate on determining the tracklist. Things like length should be discussed, etc.\u000a\u000aJust throwing stuff directly out of my brain, let me know what you think.  \u000aEdit: Lol forgot the link  \u000aEdit 2: Maybe themes should be a little more general than "serene", e.g. just symphonic power metal, or songs with excellent symphonic instrumentation, or what have you.

In one case I simply did a coin flip to decide whether Sonata Arctica's song would be 'Blood' or 'The Wolves Die Young,' as they each received one nomination and I thought it best for them to have one song present as with the other bands. Voting will be up for awhile so plenty of people can see it.\u000a\u000aEdit: Nice job guys! Already over 100 responses!\u000a\u000aEdit: A strong second day as well, with nearly 150 responses as of now.

VI like Rhapsody, DragonForce, and Twilight Force.

I haven't been able to really get into them the way I have with the three bands above. \u000a\u000aI would say a requirement would be other instruments besides guitars and drums. Keyboards at least, but the more symphonic the better. \u000a\u000aThanks for the help. \u000a\u000a**Edit: I just wanna say in case anyone ever comes back to read this that you guys are awesome. Nicest/most welcoming metal community I've ever come across. Thank you.**

VI really like their latest album Pariah's Child, despite the super-duper mixed reviews it has been receiving (I think history will look back on this album in much more favorable light; it takes some getting used to it seems). I especially love the song Blood. However, the definition of blood that's read at the beginning of the song, in what sounds like a computer generated voice, really annoys me. \u000a\u000aCan someone give me a good explanation for that definition being read at the beginning of the song, so that it feels like it fits into the song better and I can stop being annoyed by it?

sVCanadian PM Bands Index (AKA My 2014 in power metal)\u200f
p1094
VSo here's the thing. I was going to make a 2014 in power metal thingie, but it would be extremely biased to bands I was looking into. This is what happened:\u000a\u000a-In late 2013 I started editing power metal articles on wikipedia\u000a\u000a-On the list of power metal bands, there was like 2 Canadian bands. I'm a Canadian guy, so I was interested in whether Canada really had any power metal. I started looking into newer bands (since most stuff on wikipedia is a few years behind unless it's super popular). \u000a\u000a-I actually found a handful of bands that were awesome, and that's when I added a couple of newer Canadian PM bands to Wikipedia. Been watching them over 2014 and a bunch released new material. Overall I'm pretty impressed. However, here I intend to talk about all of the bands I looked at, not just ones with new material.\u000a\u000aSo here's where I tell you about them, which ones I looked at, which ones were eh, which ones were great. But before that, I'll just point out other releases in 2014 that I particularly liked:\u000a\u000a* Sonata Arctica - Pariah's Child\u000a* Alestorm - Sunset on the Golden Age\u000a* Noble Beast's self-titled debut\u000a\u000aAnyways, let's get on with this. I'll put them in alphabetical order. Generally if I couldn't find their work on youtube, I didn't look into the band (so no split up 80s/90s bands unfortunately). Wall of text time!\u000a\u000aDoesn't fit here: \u000a\u000ahttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1FVIyJjIlhPLUvi_bYazi8Q6dD8TSr4J0en-cvkykWsY/edit?usp=sharing \u000a\u000ait's on google docs.

sVFor anyone who has already listened to "Beyond the Red Mirror"
p1114
VWhat\u2019s the verdict on the bonus track \u201cDistant Memories\u201d? Is it worth buying the digipack version for, or is the album ultimately better paced without it? I really want to pre-order the album, but only the digipack version is available on Amazon for pre-order, and I don't want to buy a version of the album that has an average song in the middle of it which wrecks the pacing of greatness. Normally I wouldn't mind the addition of a bonus song like this, but its placing in the very middle of the album is concerning, whereas normally bonus songs seem to be added at the end. Its placing could potentially severely damage the experience, is what I'm getting at.\u000a\u000atl;dr version: Does the addition of "Distant Memories" damage the album experience? Is it a welcome addition, or not?
