sVCould I get some help on finding a symphonic black metal band?
p31
VMy friend told me about this symphonic black metal band to look up. The problem is, I don't remember what they were called. I remember the name started with an "A," it was two words (something like Acrach or something like that was the first word), and they consisted of three members. If one of you knows which one I'm talking about, it would be great if you could let me know. Thanks.

sVTrying to like Symphonic Black metal, care to help me out?
p93
VI have tried in the past to get into this genre, but i really cannot find anything that I liked. One of the main complaints i had was (what you always hear...) the production quality of some albums. I understand it adds to the experience and whatnot, but i just have to have decent quality or the experience is ruined for me. All that was to say, what are some good symphonic black metal bands you would reccommend to a new listener?

sVJust a little rant defending Dimmu Borgir's music.
p112
VI just really don't understand everyone's hate for Dimmu Borgir. Sure, it's not textbook for the genre, but that makes them different. Some people hate on their later albums for being to heavy in the symphony. If that's you're argument, then you have no place to judge, it's not your piece of pie and that's OK. You're only comparing apples and oranges if you're going to argue. \u000a\u000aSome say the symphony drowns out some of the more catchy riffs. Listening through the album very carefully I did notice a few (a very small few) moments where that holds true, but the symphony was good enough to make up for it. Once again if this is your problem, apples and oranges.\u000a\u000aThe most valid argument: the symphony score and essentially the biggest credit to most songs was written by someone else, so they basically paid someone else to write the music. Okay, I admit I was actually really disappointed when I found out the members of Dimmu pretty much had nothing to do the symphony. While this may be true, I think their songwriting on top of it is great. So even if you discredit the members of Dimmu, you can't discredit the music its self.\u000a\u000aIf you listen the Abrahadabra or Death Cult Armageddon or In Sorte Diaboli, with no expectations for bindings to genre, I don't see how you can hate it that much. I honestly think the main reason Dimmu Borgir is hated so much in the black metal community is that they're successful. They went outside the norm, changed things up and became the best selling band in their field.
