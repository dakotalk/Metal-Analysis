VViathyn - Ageless Stranger
p1
(lp2
VCheers, thanks for posting!
p3
asVDo you even Celt, bro?
p4
(lp5
VTry [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/23o21i/celtic_metal_what_bands_and_songs_are_the/) and [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2b91kn/powersymphonic_metal_with_irish_celtic_or_gaelic/) for some past suggestions.\u000a\u000aBtw, it's "Celtic", not "Celtish".
p6
aVIm on my phone, I know its celtic but... Phone...
p7
aVNo worries.
p8
aVI'm surprised not to see Mago de Oz on either of those lists. They're awesome! Do they not qualify for some reason?
p9
aVThe first thread has Mago de Oz mentioned. The main reason you don't see them mentioned a lot is because they've only had a couple albums that can be considered power metal, and their older material is by far their most popular.
p10
aVAh, so it does - didn't look hard enough!  I suppose they really don't have that much power metal in their library, but what is there is absolutely fantastic!
p11
aVelvenking is probably my fave for folk influenced metal.  their first two albums heathenreel and wyrd are really good, and have more folk than power.  their latest album pagen manifesto gets back to a bit stronger folk feel as well.  winterwake is also pretty solid and has a much more power metal feel to it.
p12
aVLate, but try any of Tuatha de Danann's albums. \u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVe8yvstUhg

asVSABATON - Ghost Division (OFFICIAL LIVE VIDEO)
p14
(lp15
VI love these guys so much. If you ever get a chance, they're an absolute treat to see live. I saw them with Iced Earth about half a year ago. Didn't really know Sabaton then, but they stole the show and I've been a fan ever since.
p16
aVWell, you will be happy to hear that, i posted this as a tribute to the fact that i, only a couple hours ago, bought tickets to their show in London :D\u000a\u000aI am so hyped already :D (Delain and Battle Beast are a huge bonus, as they are both awesome too)
p17
aVYes. Battle Beast is great. \u000a\u000aYou'll love Sabaton. They're so much fun. You can tell they're having a blast on stage. The show is great. I was sad I missed them last time they came through with Amon Amarth and Skeletonwitch.
p18
aVI saw the same tour, I'm sure, but in LA. I took my GF with me, and she's more of a Metal sympathizer than a fan, and even she enjoyed Sabaton, and their performance.\u000a\u000aI was just getting into Sabaton at then time, and that show definitely earned them a huge fan. They're just great.
p19
aVYeah. You can just tell they enjoy what they do very much. They're not on stage for the paycheck but because they love the music and performing.
p20
aVI saw these guys last month with Skeletonwitch and Amon Amarth. Easily the best live band there, and that's saying something with that line-up. 
p21
aVThey give definition to the "Power" in Power Metal.
p22
aV&gt; [They give definition to the "Power" in Power Metal.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/gallery/no/754.gif)\u000a\u000a
p23
aVSo much energy in their performance. Im not a big Sabaton fan but i would gladly go to their concert if its always like this!
p24
aVSeen them twice. It's always like this, and is actually a much better experience live. You can tell that they absolutely love what they do.
p25
aVOMG U GAIZ SABATON R NAZIS!!!\u000a\u000aSeriously, though, love these guys. Joakim is always great fun live, and they always sound great, unlike some...other bands I like *coughdragonforcecough*.
p26
asVAngra - Crushing Room (feat. Doro Pesch) (New Album "Secret Garden" Song)
p27
(lp28
VI guess the album leaked then?
p29
aVAngra has always been one of those bands to me that can do no wrong. Even Fabio sounds *great* on this song. And the instrumentation is, as always, perfection.\u000a\u000aBut goddamn I cannot stand Doro. And now the country of Germany will hate me for saying that. Like, literally any other female vocalist would've been better.
p30
aVI'm pretty sure Fabio doesn't sing on this song. That definitely sounds like Rafael's voice.
p31
asV[Savatagurday] Savatage- Summer's Rain
p32
(lp33
VThe final minute or so of this song is just beautiful.  The build up with the orchestra and Jon's vocals give me chills.

asVBLIND GUARDIAN - Twilight Of The Gods - In The Studio (OFFICIAL TRAILER #1)
p38
(lp39
VEveryone I know is losing their minds over the new Star Wars trailer. Me? This is what I'm losing my mind over.
p40
aVSame here! My SO is torn though, he loves both things...I feel so bad for him. His brain must be overloading with awesomeness at this point.
p41
aVThe small sample starting at 3:03 got me incredibly giddy.
p42
aVThe song sounds great. I'm hyped as fuck for the new album.
p43
aVI'm glad I'm not epileptic.
p44
aVYou are now!
p45
aVDamn it Blind Guardian, why don't you just make us wait... The hype is too strong with this one... This one week left is going to be the longest ever
p46
aVReally sounds thick and muddy so far.
p47
aVI pointed out in a youtube comment that it sounds like the video is mono. Not sure how they managed to do that
p48
aVThe magic of Nuclear Blast.\u000a\u000a*cue downvotes*
p49
aVI have no clue how they keep the quality level so high album after album. Really excited. Makes me wish I could find a studio around here to work in.
p50
aVIt's magical, how with every next album Blind Guardian is just getting better and better.
p51
asVLast Tribe - Witch Dance

p56
asVGamma Ray - Eagle
p57
(lp58
VAnd now it's time for me to revisit this album. It's been too long.
p59
aVGamma Ray is a band that eludes me a lot. I seriously need to listen to more of them
p60
aVjet noise during intro \u000a\u000afucking love this song. 
p61
asVDark Moor- Phantom Queen
p62

sVInvictus - REvolution
p64
(lp65
VCan't one of these bands spell "revolution" normally? 
p66
asVBloodBound - For The King
p67
(lp68
VI like the song, but man, the youtube compression killed the audio
p69
aVBands are naming themselves after Hammerfall songs now? I'm ok with this world. /u/fuzzynyanko nailed it.
p70
aVI believe they were around before that Hammerfall album.
p71
asVSeventh Wonder - The Black Parade
p72
(lp73
VFantastic band.  I like Tommy with Kamelot but Seventh Wonder is where his vocals really shine.  Every one of their members is really talented.
p74
aVCannot go wrong with this album.
p75
aVI love Seventh Wonder but aren't they prog metal?
p76
aVThey are, but they did originally start out as a power metal band, and some consider them to be power-prog (similar to Symphony X).
p77
aVWho said they can't be both? You can have a powerful sound and catchy choruses AND progressive song structure and crazy time signature. As stated by /u/Edledhron, There is Symphony X, but also Angra, Labÿrinth, Theocracy, Serenity, Anubis Gate, Pagan's Mind, Elegy, Evergrey, Beyond Twilight and SO many more bands that cross the boundaries of both genres.
p78
aVA band certainly can be both, whether or not SW is among such bands is what's up for debate. My own opinion is that they are not, unless you'd also count bands like Dream Theater, Haken, and Pain of Salvation as power-prog.
p79
aVFor me, it's all about those catchy choruses on Mercy Falls.
p80
aVThe instrumentation isn't really there, though. \u000a\u000aOf course, this is just a genre dispute, and not a very important one. SW is one of my favorite bands regardless of how one chooses to classify them.
p81
aVYou are right, genres and categories are not worthy of any kind of disputes. Mercy Falls is in my top 5 albums, all genres included.
p82
asVTýr - Ellindur Bóndi Á Jaðri
p83
(lp84
VMy favorite song on *The Lay of Thrym*.
p85
aVTyr is my all-time favorite power metal band, and this is a damn good example why.
p86
asVRadiance - The Burning Sun (Sami Raatikainen - Necrophagist side project)
p87
(lp88
VI was wondering how power a Necro side project could be. ;)\u000a\u000aHard to believe it's Levén. :/
p89

aVHail! 
p95
aVMy wife sets this as her ringtone every December.
p96
asVOrden Ogan - A Reason to Give
p97
(lp98
VI really liked this song, but not a very big fan of the rest I am finding with them unfortunately.\u000a\u000aMaybe the rest of this album is up to it.
p99
asV[Karaoke]Edguy - Mysteria
p100
(lp101
VI need to re-institute my subscription to JoySound to rip some more of these, my channel has quite a few of them so far. It's only like 1000 yen a month, but my digital wallet ran out of money and 3rd parties are such a rip off. If you can give me a docomo email address I can easily get more of these.
p102
asVWould people be interested in an Iron Savior guide/writeup?
p103
(lp104
VJust something to think about, but I'm not a huge fan of the "Guide to _____" that gives a biographical explanation of the band. To me, I could just read their wikipedia page and read around a little bit more.\u000a\u000aWhat I'm interested in, for a "Guide To" topic would be recommendations of what songs to listen to, explanation of the techniques and lyrical content and other information which would help me get into the band. After I read a "guide" topic, I should want to listen to the *music* because it's been hyped up so much :D To me, it's not particularly helpful to have a "history of ____" topic, unless it's called that! I would think a "guide to" should teach me what to expect with the music, which should obviously intertwine with the history a bit (lineup changes etc)\u000a\u000aJust something to think about. I'm definitely interested in something like this for Iron Savior though :D
p105
aVYeah, sorry that's sort of what I meant. I would analyze the music, how it changes from album to album, etc.
p106
aVNo problem, it's just that the "guides" included in the sidebar are, while appreciated, not particularly good for getting into the band itself.\u000a\u000aGood luck :D
p107
aVYeah I'd read it, listened to some of their songs and would be interested in purchasing a few albums
p108
aVBring it on!
p109
aVDo you know if there is a list anywhere of all of the songs that tell the Iron Savior story? And if not would you be able to throw one together? Not sure if this is the type of things you were offering but it sounds like something you could probably do easily.\u000a\u000aI really like the story, but their website basically just outlines the whole thing, so I guess to get the most fleshed out version I'd have to just listen to the whole things straight through.
p110
aVI don't think there's a list anywhere. Since they dropped the full album stories, there's been one or two songs on each album that tell a little bit. I'd be glad to add a list to my writeup.
p111
aVI'm interested in reading any guide on any PM band. I think they're the type of fantastic content I'd love to see more of on this sub. \u000a\u000aRegarding Iron Savior specifically, I was actually kind of interested after listening to some stuff off their most recent album, which I heard wasn't that great. So I'd love to  learn more about some of their "better" stuff, for sure. \u000a\u000aI think something touching on all their albums would be best. If you'd like an example, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1dmxof/a_beginners_guide_to_coheed_cambria/) is one of the best guides to a band I've seen (Not PM though). 
p112
aVThat's a good reference, thanks! 
p113
aVGuide to Iron Savior: put your phone on mute, dim the lights, sit down in your favourite recliner and listen to Unification from start to finish. That album is a masterpiece. \u000a\u000aP.s.: they have amazing songs throughout their discography . I wont hijack OP, but for those of you who never really paid attention to the band, you should. 
p114
aV100% agree. I'm gonna try and post it this weekend.
p115
aVSeems like you've decided to do it, looking forward to your guide!
p116
asVHoly Grail - My Last Attack
p117
(lp118
VWas there for the music video shoot. Didn't make the final cut of the video ::tear::\u000a\u000aI need to get back to LA so I can be an extra in more music videos.
p119
aVI remember first hearing this song thinking wow this band is going to be amazing. After getting the CD "My Last Attack" was the only song I really liked. \u000a\u000aThe other songs sounded a lot more Avenge Sevenfold Influenced, not sure what genre that is but it sounded more like that. 
p120
asVNew release: Engage - Don't Turn Back (Deluxe Edition)
p121
(lp122
VYou had me with that album art :D\u000a\u000aThis is good stuff! Lots of power and energy and ludicrously high vocals. Yum! \u005cm/\u000a\u000aWas there a physical release I can get my hands on?
p123
aVThere WAS a physical release back in the day but only digital copies now.  \u000a\u000aI did some googling and found this site has my lyrics up.. can't find anywhere on the internets that transcribe my lyrics for the demo tracks though...\u000a\u000ahttp://www.metallyrica.com/lyrica/engage/dont_turn_back.html#1
p124
aVThis is REALLY good! I just listened to the whole Don't Turn Back album w/ my Google Play music subscription. I'm a big fan of the overall production. The sound is so clear and well mixed that it's hard to believe that this isn't a major studio release and the guitar work is killer!\u000a\u000aAre you guys still playing together?
p125
aVThanks for the compliment! \u000a\u000a\u000aWe do not still play together, we all kinda moved on to other stuff.  There are a lot of things I would change about the recording and stuff like that but overall I think we did really good for recording ourselves.  We just purchased equipment here and there, read a lot and just played around with mixing until we got a good sound.  \u000a\u000a\u000aIf I were to do it again I would have boosted the high mids on my bass signal some more so that it would punch through a bit
p126
aVThat's a shame, the way you guys sounds makes it seem like you played together with some really good chemistry. Do you still keep in touch with them? Are you or your former mates involved in any new projects that we can check out?
p127
aVYeah, Chris (guitar) just house sat for me the other day. He's been my pal since 3rd grade. \u000a\u000aNo other projects except for james (guitar). He majored in jazz, lived in Qatar for a few years performing there and now he's back performing in a fado group (Portuguese folk stuff. Very good) called fado nasso. I think they have a facebook page. 
p128
aVHere is James' Fado group:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.cdbaby.com/cd/fadonosso2\u000a\u000ahttps://www.facebook.com/fadonosso\u000a\u000a\u000aI am convinced that the guy can literally do anything musically.  He can shred like Yngwie then switch it up to Gypsie, Jazz, whatever man
p129
aVI dont know how much control you have, but you seem to be lumped into a group with other bands titled engage that are not related to you. Might be worh trying to seperate yourself from them. Sounds pretty good so far though, will give a full listen sometime soon
p130
asVHelloween - All Over the Nations
p131
(lp132
VDoctors should start prescribing Helloween songs instead of antidepressants.
p133
aVAgreed. The other day I revisited Keeper of the Seven Keys Part II (not that I needed to; that album is ingrained in my head), and it was honestly the best 50 minutes of my week.
p134
aVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg8VbwRwPxY\u000a\u000athis was a related vid. kids hilarious

asVBLIND GUARDIAN - Beyond The Red Mirror - In The Studio (OFFICIAL TRAILER #6)
p137
(lp138
VNooooooooo! I shouldn't have posted this! I had 69 link karma. It was hilllllarious...
p139
aVThis will probably be an unpopular opinion but I'm honestly not all that impressed with the album, I liked the previous one much more. It has really good moments but all in all it's pretty average, and the overuse of backing chorus vocals was kinda annoying. It also lacked the pure metal energy of previous albums since they focused on the epic orchestral sound so much. I was expecting more songs like The Holy Grail.\u000a\u000aI'd give the album a 6/10.
p140
aVAgreed. I thought it lacked the perfect mix of epic and agression from the previous album. There are some great moments in there and Twilight of the Gods is an absolute blast, but the rest didn't stand out all that much. Still a good album though.
p141
aVIt will be an unpopular opinion because this subreddit sucks Blind Guardian's dick to hell and back. They're not infallible and this album shows it.
p142
asVBABYMETAL have already gone full power metal before! Here's "Akatsuki", a massive tribute to '80s power metal
p143
(lp144
V The lead singer is wearing a scale-mail vest and has a battle onstage.\u000a\u000aIf that's not Power Metal then nothing is.\u000a\u000aAlso, damn, that girl can sing.  
p145
aVThis is one of the most over-produced metal songs I've ever heard. It's like every last word was run through autotune half a dozen times. The vocals have this extremely soft, fuzzy texture around them that doesn't sound the least bit natural. Wouldn't sound right coming from a robot, either. \u000a\u000aTotal uncanny valley. 
p146
aVJust for you, [here's a live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjQsayrmMoU). :)\u000a\u000aAlthough, I do agree with you to some extent, but I stop hearing the overproduction once the instruments kick in.
p147
aVHearing this track live is very different to the live recording, Suzuka has proven herself to have a great voice, and hearing her sing this live, really brings it out\u000a\u000aMaybe im bias though, i just think this is an all-round great track, and it really shows off the people behind the instruments too.
p148
aVEither way, why listen to this when you can listen to the band that did it first, X Japan?\u000a\u000aThe melodies and instrumentals are similar, but better with X Japan. The only difference is that, instead of instrumentalists, we see (literal) 7th graders dancing around in red skirts. Oh, and female vocals instead of Toshi.
p149
aVIt's not like Toshi had stellar vocals back in *Jealousy*. And I don't know if you watched the video, but this is the one song that they don't dance to, as well as one of the only songs where it's only the lead singer on stage. 
p150
aVSo what's going on at 2:51?
p151
aVA fucking awesome fight scene. It's actually part of the story that the whole concert tells. The other two girls get taken to the "dark side of metal" (which can be interpreted as nu metal) and the older girl must save them by fighting off the evil spirit within them (and performing a kickass power metal song). \u000a\u000aThat's not even dancing. They're clearly having a pro wrestling match. Stone Cold has a run in about halfway through. If you look closely, you can see one hit the other with a barbed wire-wrapped steel chair.
p152
aVAnd that's before Golden God Cena gets tapped in for the finisher.\u000a\u000aPoor girl didn't even realise it was a tag team match.
p153

aVJudas Priest, wow. Not too disappointed?
p160
aVNope, they were better than I expected, so maybe I had low expectations. Halford killed it on "Victim of Changes". 
p161
aVAdd Kamijo on there.
p162
aVUmmm, I never saw Kamijo live this year. Maybe in 2015 when he visits the USA, though. 
p163
aVOh, wait, I thought that was a list of shows for 2015 that you were hyped for. Never mind.
p164
aVAll of them because I live in Tasmania...
p165
aVI see you've been licking toads. Good choice. :S
p166
aVNo toads down this far just yet thank god
p167
aVI was lucky enough to make it to a Sonata Arctica show.\u000a\u000aBest day of my life. (v'_')v
p168
aVI saw them the first time they came to America. I'll never forget it.
p169
aVI have seen Sonata 3 times, every year they come to London, next year marking the 4th...\u000a\u000aI never get tired of their shows, they just have such an amazing energy to them...
p170
aVSabbaton, Edguy and Hammerfall. \u000a\u000aThe 3 bands are fucking amazing.\u000a\u000aalso some minor local bands.
p171
aVWith money being hard pressed to come by this year, I only saw two concerts this year;\u000a\u000aIced Earth/Sabaton/ReVamp &amp; Primal Fear.\u000a\u000aGranted, both of them were VIP experiences.\u000a\u000aEdit; these were Toronto, Canada shows.
p172
aVI was at the Primal Fear show in Toronto as well. It was a killer performance!
p173
aVIndeed. Even the new stuff was amazing. Still a little sad they played no material off of Black Sun. (Countdown to Insanity but it's an intro track...)
p174
aVHow was Floor?
p175
aVShe was amazing, just like the last time I saw her 7 years prior with After Forever. She has quite the stage presence when she performs. Also, massive windmills from her and her hair.
p176
aVThat's great to hear. I'm glad she didn't drop everything for Nightwish. When was that? I wanted to visit To this summer, but I had zero le cash.
p177
aVEarly April. I want to say the 7th but don't quote me. I know it was a Monday as Sabaton wondered how the crowd had so much energy on a Monday night.

aVWho considers Amaranthe power metal?

aVYours are cuter. ;P
p201
asVSongs similar to A Quest For the Crown by Falconer?
p202
(lp203
VWell, there's the easy answer of the other Falconer songs that also use tambourine (I'm not sure how familiar you are with Falconer's discography, which is why I bring it up), which would be *Lament of a Minstrel, Tower of the Queen, Child of Innocence* and *Scoundrel and the Squire*. But, that doesn't *really* answer your question, so I'll move on.\u000a\u000aSo, there's some Blind Guardian songs as well, I figure they're probably your best bet.\u000a\u000a[Skalds and Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3_S1Q40HZo)  \u000a[The Bard's Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC7iR577OQw)\u000a\u000aSo I also like [Battlelore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPzc5s1JXXY), although they're Epic/Symphonic and not power, as well as using growls from time to time. [Fairyland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21JTcHB9USM) is another band which I see with the medieval-y sound a bit. I'm going to second [Rhapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XICdeUlTmQ4) as a suggestion as well.\u000a\u000aThere's also the question of exactly how much metal you want, because there's certainly some [softer music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-21AtiWV3TE) that I would suggest. One thing which rather bothers me is that medieval metal really refers to music that is actually medieval style, rather than sounding "medieval", like this Falconer song does. Not to mention, it's all in German (which I like, but it makes it difficult to recommend for others).\u000a\u000aSince I don't really know anything about what music you listen to, I'm just going to assume you don't listen to any folk metal. (If you do, I'm sorry. :P) So, first of all, [Skyclad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOwxjxEwZgA). [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwlRmv8TEWA) [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kigXJfNu_A). There's also [Elvenking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgzlOMVyL2g), who are power/folk band. It should be noted that none of these bands are really much like Falconer at all, but it's all good regardless. [Tengwar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynr7i2ozPec) is also a band that I would recommend. [Saltatio Mortis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXe8Z-GhayU) usually sings in German, but they're a pretty good folky band.\u000a\u000aSadly, I've sort of gone it bit off topic, but I just want you to know that I reached all of these bands after finding Falconer and looking to find similar music. So, if I like it, I figure you might as well. Besides, I would rather have some answers that are wrong or unhelpful than no answers at all.
p204
aVThanks for all these suggestions! I really like those Skyclad songs, I will be checking out more of them soon. You've given me a good list of music that I like, and I am sure I can branch out from here, so thanks again!

V**Best Album:** Falconer - Black Moon Rising\u000a\u000a*Simply put this is the album that got most plays from me. Sensational in almost every respect*\u000a\u000a**Best Song:** Falconer - Halls and Chambers\u000a\u000a*Super hard choice but again the one with the most replays wins.*\u000a\u000a**Song With Best Solo:** Unisonic - Your Time Has Come\u000a\u000a*Are there objectively better solos out there? Yes. But none stuck in my head like this one did.*\u000a\u000a**Best Unsigned Release:** Noble Beast - Noble Beast\u000a\u000a*Hands down. No question.*\u000a\u000a**Best Female-fronted Release:** N/A\u000a\u000a*I don't feel qualified enough to answer this one.*\u000a\u000a**Album With Best Nonguitar Instrumentation:** Neonfly - Strangers in Paradise\u000a\u000a*Seriously the symphonic element comes out of nowhere and it's really good.*\u000a\u000a**Best Album Cover:** [Unisonic - Light of Dawn](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/Light_of_Dawn.jpg)\u000a\u000a*Forget generic power metal cover cliches and the same Felipe Machado Franco-esque artwork, Unisonic went "FUCK IT LET'S HAVE A FLEET OF STEAMPUNK SPACESHIPS"*\u000a\u000a**Singer Of The Year:** Ralf Scheepers of Primal Fear\u000a\u000a*Lot of great vocalists showing some amazing work this year but I'm amazed at the consistent quality of Scheepers. Every song he sings still has every last drop of him at his prime and he's like an air-raid siren on every track.*\u000a\u000a**Album with Best Lyrics:** Falconer - Black Moon Rising\u000a\u000a*Beautiful. Haunting. Paints a hell of a story.*\u000a\u000a**Lifetime Achievement Award:** Kai Hansen\u000a\u000a*Yes his voice is 80% gravel now but he can still kill the high notes when he wants to and he's the only grand-daddy of the WHOLE GENRE still going strong with his band, still touring like a bastard, kicking out intense shred guitar and putting out decent stuff with a supergroup all while smiling like a chubby kid. And he's 51 YEARS OLD!! Love him.*\u000a\u000a**Mightiest Warrior Of 2014:** Fabio Lione\u000a\u000a*It's tough being the new guy and I think Angra have found an unexpected perfect-fit with this power metal God. Plus his voice hasn't changed a day. Still remains THE voice of symphonic metal for me.*\u000a\u000a**Upsword Award for Best User:** /u/UnlostHorizon\u000a\u000a*Do I like the fucker? Not always. Is he too opinionated and standoffish? Yes. Does he like stuff that makes the bile rise in my gullet? Yes, sir. Does he contribute consistently informative, discussion-worthy, unique and entertaining content? FUCK YES. This is well-deserved.*

aVHey guys, I've been reading for about a month now, but I just made an account and this is my first post. \u000a\u000aBest Album: Vetelgyus - Galneryus \u2028\u000aI wish I had more time to listen to more albums; I was going to choose Falconer, Twilight Force, or DragonForce, until I heard this masterpiece during New Year's. It's not "epic" in the same way as Angel of Salvation, but its best moments just really resonate for reasons I can't explain. The opening synths in "There's No Escape," the defining melody in "Enemy to Injustice," the dynamic splendor of "The Judgement Day," the synergized endings to the previous track and "Attitude to Life," and the beautiful closing "The Voyage."  This album has so many defining moments and addictive replay value for me.\u000a \u000aBest Song: "The Judgement Day" - Galneryus\u2028\u000aI had "Twilight Horizon" by Twilight Force chosen, but after hearing this album, it was between "Enemy to Injustice" and "The Judgement Day." While I like that epic melody in the former, "The Judgement Day" just has it all: epic intro, epic solo that through me for a surprise in where it went, and amazing finishing synergy by the whole band. It doesn't have the beautiful neoclassical ferocity of "Angel of Salvation," but it's epic in its own way. \u000a\u000aSong With Best Solo: "Vetelgyus" - Galneryus\u2028\u000aAs an aspiring shredder who's heard just about every type of guitar solo, not much has impressed me this year. Syu in "Vetelgyus" though combines guitar soloing with the other instrumentalists perfectly and really hits hard with the synergy. The whole song is an instrumental loaded with solos. I love the guitar vs. keyboards duel starting at 2:56, which gave me a big grin, a feat last achieved by Pathfinder's "Beyond the Space, Beyond the Time." At 6:12 there are irish melodies that are enhanced by the other instruments really pushing the guitar soloing. ShadowStrike was a close second. Also, not PM related, but check out Ignazio di Salvo and Per Nilsson (Scar Symmetry) for my favorite lead-guitar material this year. \u000a\u000aBest Unsigned Release: Noble Beast - Noble Beast\u2028\u000aShadowStrike was the other contender (gorgeous guitar and vocals), but this trumps it with the best guitar riffs of the year. The vocalist is one of the best this year too alongside Twilight Force\u2019s singer. This release is pure power metal with extra ferocity. I wouldn\u2019t have heard Noble Beast without everyone here deifying it, so thanks everyone! \u000a\u000aBest Female-fronted Release: Back from the Edge - MindMaze\u2028\u000aEpica and Divine Ascension had strong releases, and I still plan to listen to Triosphere, but for now I give credit to MindMaze. There's so much melody in the vocals, and it doesn't try to be operatic. It reminds me of Seven Kingdoms like the guitar melodies too. Constant reply value and amazing solo-work too. Plus there's Mike LePond from Symphony X! \u000a\u000aAlbum With Best Nonguitar Instrumentation: Vetelgyus - Galneryus \u2028\u000aThe orchestral sections are blissful, but the keyboards shine through the most. Yuhki is a godly player.  There were other albums with amazing ethnic instrumental flare and exotic timbres like "Fantasia" - Estate, but I felt "Vetelgyus" was much stronger. \u000a\u000aBest Album Cover: Fantasia - Estate\u2028\u000aExotic rainbows, mountains, nebulas, and panflutes. That is all.\u000a\u000aAlbum with Best Lyrics: Black Moon Rising - Falconer\u2028\u000aI was not really that cognizant of lyricism quality, especially in PM. I should as I write literature and poetry often. I've always liked Falconer's lyrical quality though as I've heard most of their releases. It paints imagery while sounding genuine and not that cheesy. Epica also had quality lyrics this year (given this style), but Falconer just makes a more genuine connection with me. \u000a\u000aSinger Of The Year: Christian Hedgren (Twilight Force) \u2028This guy's vocals blew my mind; they're simply breathtaking. I can't believe I read some people don't like his vocals. Some parts in "Twilight Horizon" are really high and he just keeps going. My new favorite voice up there with my favorites: Tommy Karevik, Roy Khan, Simon Kostro, Russell Allen, Mathias Blad, Matt Smith, Marc Hudson, Rob Tyrant, etc. \u000a\u000a/r/PowerMetal Lifetime Achievement Award To An Individual For Outstanding Contribution To Power Metal: Fabio Lione\u2028\u000aThis guy's discography is ridiculous. Rhapsody (of almost every type), Vision Divine, and now Angra. Plus he's contributed to many PM bands like Altair, Ancient Bards, Sebastien, The 4th Dimension, and even a guest in Ayreon. He's even helped out Kamelot for a tour when Roy left.\u000a  \u000aMightiest Warrior Of 2014: Christian Hedgren (Twilight Force)\u2028\u000aToo epic of a voice. Pure PM. 
p231
aVSo these are my pics. I don't really have an opinion on half of the categories, so I'll omit those.\u000a\u000a**Best Album**: Sabaton - Heroes. Close call between this and Divine Ascension's Liberator. I've missed most of 2014's releases, mainly because I'm relatively new to the genre and diving into discographies of several bands. But out of the ones I did check out, Sabaton wins out.\u000a\u000a**Best Song**: Sabaton - Night Witches. *How* is this not on everybody's top list? Again, close call between this and *Stronger* by Divine Ascension. This song is, in a word, superawesomeholyshitexplosivepowerwinwinwin.\u000a\u000a**Best Female-fronted Release**: Divine Ascension - Liberator. Everybody goes for Triosphere, and I'm sure Triosphere will win. I don't mind. I have not listened to Triosphere's release, but I will cause it sounds goddamn good. For me, though, Divine Ascension's *Liberator* blew my mind.\u000a\u000a**Upsword Award for Best User**: /u/SinuataBouquet. While the role of posting weekly release threads have shuffled a bit, I'd like to raise my glass to /u/SinuataBouquet for his efforts. Also, where the fuck are you man.
p232
aVTanks for giving Sabaton some love. Some think that Heroes isn't all that good, but, well, it's hands down their best album IMO. So many awesome tracks.
p233
aVSome of the things I nominated (that haven't been nominated yet from what I see):\u000a\u000a**Best Song**: Melodius Deite - Land of Fantasy\u000a\u000a9+ min epic full of the most wonderful instrumental parts I've heard in an album, packed with frenetic energy and a chorus that copies Pachelbel's Canon in D note-by-note (which is 100% a good thing).\u000a\u000a**Best unsigned release**: Enceladus - Journey to Enlightenment\u000a\u000aApparently Noble Beast will totally dominate this year, which is a shame because Enceladus's debut is damn amazing and it gets hardly any praise. The solos are insane.\u000a\u000a**Album with best lyrics**: Derdian - Human Reset. \u000a\u000aIt's not exactly lyric poetry, but power metal lyrics tend to be generally crappy. Their song "These Rails Will Bleed" completely hit me out of the blue with its theme of suicide (uncanny for power metal) and its powerful message, and it's probably the main reason why I put Derdian here.\u000a\u000a**Singer of the Year**: Tony Kakko\u000a\u000aI mean come on, the guy sang in 2 albums and his voice has developed nicely (nasal tone and all).\u000a\u000a**Mightiest Warrior of 2014**: Chris Bay\u000a\u000aFor turning Freedom Call from "eh they suck now" to "holy shit they're amazing again!" with a single album.
p234
aV**Best Album** - Freedom Call - Beyond\u000a\u000aThis album is stunning.  A few songs that I do not like (even then, they are not that forgettable), but damn, they brought back the magic in a whole new way.  The atmosphere of this album is so intensely and entrancingly fantasy, I just nergasm every time I listen to them.  The melodies, the keyboards, the vocals, the song-writing; it all manages to be so catchy, while being a fairly depthful album for Freedom call.\u000a\u000a**Best Song** - Neonfly - Heart of the Sun\u000a\u000aI am probably the only one close to thinking this, but something about this song hit me in all the right ways.  I get lost in my fantasy mind when I hear it.  Elvenking\u2019s Witches Gather was a close second.  If the second half was as good as the first, well damn, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do\u2026\u000a\u000a**Song With Best Solo** - Sabaton - Night Witches\u000a\u000aThe solo of this song is pretty nice and it keeps the pace and badass feel of the song flowing very well.\u000a\u000a**Best Unsigned Release** Noble Beast - Noble Beast\u000a\u000aThis album was pretty amazing.  The song-writing and technical work is fantastic.  I do not enjoy it nearly as much as some people, and really the only songs that get spins are Nothing to Repent and We Burn, but still - I appreciate it quite a lot.\u000a\u000a**Best Female-fronted Release** Epica - The Quantum Enigma\u000a\u000aI rarely like female-fronted bands  I usually prefer ladies that sound like men, but damn, there is something about Simone Simons\u2019 voice that just gets me.  I choose this over Triosphere due to the symphonic elements and simply liking more songs, though Triosphere was pretty good as well.\u000a\u000a**Album With Best Non-guitar Instrumentation** Twilight Force - Tales of Ancient Prophecies\u000a\u000aMushmancat continues to be incredibly wrong.  This album was fantastic - better than anything Rhapsody of Fire has done (honestly, I do not understand the appeal).  Rhapsody of Fire\u2019s problem is they use the symphonies in a very generic sounding way (besides some exceptions, notable Queen of the Dark Horizon).  Twilight Force brings in the symphony and gives it personality; makes it catchy.  I wish Wintersun released Time II this year, because I am sure it would have won.  Oh well.  Whatever year it is released, it will win.\u000a\u000a**Best Album Cover** - Freedom Call - Beyond\u000a\u000aMmf.  Hits me in all the nerdy parts.\u000a\u000a**Album with Best Lyrics** Triosphere - Heart of the Matter\u000a\u000aI love these kinds of lyrics\u2026 not much more to say.\u000a\u000a**Singer of the Year** Michael Kiske\u000a\u000a \u2026.he sounds as good as ever.\u000a\u000a**/r/PowerMetal Lifetime Achievement Award to an Individual for Outstanding Contribution to Power Metal** - Michael Kiske\u000a\u000aI was close to saying Fabio Lione, but honestly, Michael Kiske is just fantastic.  The fact that he is doing what he does at that age astounds me.  I am worried though, because he simply can\u2019t keep up live in 2014 from what I have heard.  2013 and before was fantastic.  Hansi Kursch can take this in 2015.\u000a\u000a**Mightiest Warrior of 2014** - Marc Hudson\u000a\u000aI envy the shit out of this guy.  So young; so perfect.  Honestly, listen to him live; it is stupid.\u000a\u000a**/r/PowerMetal Upsword Award to a User for Contribution to the Subreddit** - That guy who does all them band write-ups\u2026 yeah.
p235
aVThe more I listen to Neonfly's "Heart of the Sun", the more I love it. I'm glad it got a mention, I kinda forgot about it at the time of voting but it's song of the year #3 for me, behing Night Witches and Stronger (Divine Ascension).
p236
aVWhy the hell are people nominating Kiske for lifetime achievement.  The dude stopped making metal for a good 20 years...
p237
aVMaybe, but his guest appearances and return to power metal in the latest Unisonic album are pretty big.

aVHere's mine (I'll explain anything not covered in my [end of the year review](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2pxvtc/edledhrons_two_thousand_fourteen_in_power_metal/))\u000a\u000aBest Album: Falconer - Black Moon Rising\u000a\u000aBest Song: Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods\u000a\u000aSong With Best Solo: Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods\u000a\u000aSince this is the big official thing, I decided to break with my no-BG or Falconer policy, and I'm a BG fanboy so deal with it! \u000a\u000aBest Unsigned Release: Noble Beast - Noble Beast\u000a\u000aNoble Beast got some mentions in my thread, but seriously listen to this if you haven't already! It's raw power metal excellence, and the vocalist is fantastic!\u000a\u000aBest Female-fronted Release: Triosphere - The Heart of the Matter\u000a\u000aHonestly, easily a contender for album of the year female-fronted or not!\u000a\u000aAlbum With Best Nonguitar Instrumentation: Kamijo - Heart\u000a\u000aI would go with Epica, but I don't see them as a power metal band. Triosphere came in a close second thanks to their use of the hammond organ, but Kamijo's instrumentation throughout the album is simply at the top tier level of excellence.\u000a\u000aBest Album Cover: Falconer - Black Moon Rising\u000a\u000aSinger Of The Year: Hansi Kürsch\u000a\u000aAgain, breaking with the No BG/Falconer thing. Hansi is simply my favorite vocalist. He could sing the phone book and he'd win this award.\u000a\u000aAlbum with Best Lyrics: Falconer - Black Moon Rising\u000a\u000aOne doesn't listen to power metal to discover a new Shakespeare, but we should celebrate those bands which rise beyond the cheesiest of the cheese. Falconer is one such band, and I enjoyed their lyrics the most this year.\u000a\u000aLifetime Achievement Award: Hansi Kürsch\u000a\u000aThe mightiest vocalist of all, half of the primary songwriters for Blind Guardian, an influence on many, and participant in many other projects and bands. Hansi has established himself in the top circle of the power metal pantheon.\u000a\u000aMightiest Warrior Of 2014: André Olbrich\u000a\u000aThe other half of Blind Guardian's songwriting, and while André doesn't get as much attention as the band's frontman, his accomplishments are no less. He's developed a distinct guitar style and has guided Blind Guardian's evolution through the decades while retaining top notch songwriting quality throughout. Twilight of the Gods is an excellent example of this.\u000a\u000aUpsword Award for Best User: /u/mistermillennia \u000a\u000aWhile I haven't commented on many of his posts, I have appreciated reading through many of them, and he maintains a level of quality, effort, and dedication that is simply unmatched on this sub.

aVMy picks, if anyone cares.\u000a\u000a**Album**- [Noble Beast- S/T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1571Ucf3XA)\u000a\u000aIts not really close here.  This album destroys. \u000a\u000a**Song**- [Noble Beast- Nothing to Repent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB6vN3VA_OQ)\u000a\u000asee above\u000a\u000a**Solo**- Noble Beast- Nothing to Repent\u000a\u000aThe song is just insanely fucking good. \u000a\u000a**Unsigned Release**- [Disforia- The Age of Ether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRFMOXWUOQ)\u000a\u000aJust to diversify a little.  Noble Beast was superior, but this album deserves a nomination. Plus Hansi lent his vocals to the album, which should tell you something.\u000a\u000a**Female Fronted Album**- [Triosphere- The Heart of the Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYKX3yxWy1k)\u000a\u000aI feel like this band is about to blow up and a lot of that has to do with the presence of Ida Haukland.\u000a\u000a**Non-guitar Instrumentation**- [Adamantra- Act II- Silent Narratives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e756WPVJoDQ)\u000a\u000aChristian Pulkkinen has earned his spot among the top keyboardists of the genre with this album.  And of that wasn't enough the orchestation, when used, compliments the music perfectly. \u000a\u000a**Album Cover**- [Winter's Edge- The Ferryman's Eyes](http://f1.bcbits.com/img/a3928078660_10.jpg)\u000a\u000aLook at that shit! God damn gorgeous\u000a\u000a**Singer**- [Michael Kiske](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRDalM6c3hI)\u000a\u000aHe sounds as good as ever.  \u000a\u000a**Lifetime Achievement**- Hansi Kursch\u000a\u000aIts a no-brainer. The mastermind behind the definitive power metal band.  Hansen got the award last year, so next in line is withouta doubt Hansi.\u000a\u000a**Mightiest Warrior**- Joakim Broden\u000a\u000aSabaton are insanely overrated, but you can't deny that Joakim eats, sleeps, and breathes metal.  His stage presence is just crazy and on top of everything he brought the band back from a split up and has made them arguably more popular than ever.  I may find his music mediocre, but I won't deny that Joakim IS metal. \u000a\u000a**Upsword award**- MisterMillenia.  As said before, his write ups are a highlight of the week around here. The dude did a massive writeup for Panopticon when I posted it, thats just dedication.  \u000a\u000a\u000a

aV&gt; He sounds as good as ever. \u000a\u000aFor me, Kiske keeps sounding better than he did before. Songwriters are finding out how to use his voice in awesome ways

aVWell, here goes nothing. I should mention a lot of my votes were done within the realm of possibility (i.e. choosing a nominee that stands a chance of winning). If you've checked out my posts over the past year, some of these should be no surprise to you. These are who I picked:\u000a\u000a* **Best Album:** Triosphere - [*The Heart of the Matter*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0)\u000a\u000aYeah, I know this wasn't my #1 album of the year, but there's no way that Outloud is going to win this, so I decided to give my vote to Triosphere, who released an absolutely incredible album in November. It should be mandatory listening for anyone voting in this poll, at the very least.\u000a\u000a* **Best Song:** Kamijo - "[Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg_DOt-xyig)"\u000a\u000aNo real surprise here. This song is fantastic, and I know I'm not the only one who hold that opinion.\u000a\u000a* **Song With Best Solo:** Jupiter - "[Last Moment](http://youtu.be/T4t_P6kKXEk?t=3m25s)"\u000a\u000aAgain, not a huge surprise if you've followed my posts or if you've heard this solo. I promise there'll be no more JPM here!\u000a\u000a* **Best Unsigned Release:** Ninth Circle - [*Legions of the Brave*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzlYdS7hZ_0)\u000a\u000aThis is probably my only "wasted" nomination, since it's a given that you guys are going to vote for Noble Beast's debut album (which is incredibly overrated), but I thought this album at least deserved a mention somewhere in this voting.\u000a\u000a* **Best Female-fronted Release:** Triosphere - [*The Heart of the Matter*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0)\u000a\u000aIf this surprised you, you may need glasses.\u000a\u000a* **Album With Best Nonguitar Instrumentation:** Kamijo - [*Heart*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVYZe9NVq2g)\u000a\u000aI lied about the JPM thing, btw. It was between this and Epica, frankly, and I decided to give the vote to Kamijo, since Epica's main drawing power on their new album, IMO, was the heavier sound derived from the guitars, not the orchestral passages.\u000a\u000a* **Best Album Cover:** Estate - [*Fantasia*](http://mightymusic.dk/wp-content/uploads/Cover-RGB.jpg)\u000a\u000aI'm gonna be pissed if Sabaton wins this or something. Just look at that cover.\u000a\u000a* **Album with Best Lyrics:** Triosphere - [*The Heart of the Matter*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0)\u000a\u000aI'm gonna be pissed if Sabaton wins this or something.\u000a\u000a* **Singer Of The Year:** [Marc Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQPWAJWAYNQ)\u000a\u000aI'm gonna be pissed if Joakim Broden wins this or something. Marc did a stellar job on the new DF album, and his live performances are almost impeccable. He's slotted himself almost seamlessly into the band and that deserves praise.\u000a\u000a* **/r/PowerMetal Lifetime Achievement Award To An Individual For Outstanding Contribution To Power Metal:** [Michael Kiske](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92_XyoAGprc)\u000a\u000aRelevant link. Those lyrics are all I need to say.\u000a\u000a* **Mightiest Warrior Of 2014:** [Marc Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvquZi1Cipw)\u000a\u000aThis dude genuinely seems to love what he's doing, he's great at what he does, and I'd be pretty content with having him represent power metal at some barbaric metal conference. Either him or Fabio Lione, but since Fabio didn't release anything substantial in 2014, my vote goes to Marc.\u000a\u000a* **/r/PowerMetal Upsword Award To A User For Contribution To The Subreddit:** /u/MisterMillennia\u000a\u000aThis fucker has been doing complete writeups on all the previews in the weekly releases thread for about 2/3 of the year. They're massively long, and they're a breath of fresh air from the usual comments that single out just one album and make a joke/comment about it. I think his efforts should be recognized, and his love for power metal (which has blossomed tenfold this year) should be acknowledged. He's always been open to new music, new vocal styles, new bands, and he's done nothing but be as kind and as insightful as he can be on all of his posts, and that's the kind of guy I want to see get rewarded with this award.

aVOk, here it goes\u000a\u000a* **Album** - [Crimson Shadows - Kings Among Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrULHAdyqBg)\u000a\u000aI know, It's not 100% clean power metal band, but those drums, those guitars, those solos are just insane! But i have to mention that if i could choose more albums it'll be Dragonforce and Hammerfall\u000a\u000a* **Song** - Crimson Shadows - Freedom and Salvation (can't find album version on YT so no link here, but listen to it on Spotify)\u000a\u000aOh moomy, this song is so great. It's... It's... IT'S MAGNIFICENT! (I love this word)\u000a\u000a* **Solo** - [Dragonforce - Extraction Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdd4eU4YHVE)\u000a\u000aSure, it's Dragonforce! It's always Herman Li.\u000a\u000a* **Unsigned Release** - [Kolony - Sledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fywLXF2yJmI)\u000a\u000aI don't know what to say really. Just listen.\u000a\u000a* **Female Fronted Album** - [Triosphere - The Heart of the Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqFtlAnhzu8)\u000a\u000aI'm not a big fan of female fronted power metal bands (Actually the only female fronted bands i like are Battle Beast, Forgotten Tales and Claymorean) but after i first heard her voice, i wasn't sure if its female or male fronted band. And it's absolutely epic.\u000a\u000a* **Non-guitar Instrumentation** [Exlibris - Aftereal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd30lArQdaQ)\u000a\u000aI love keys on this album but the violin solo on "The Day of Burning" by Zbigniew Wodecki... Unreal!\u000a\u000a* **Album Cover** [Neonfly - Strangers in Paradise](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H6NElpJlCsA/VDL5AcJetcI/AAAAAAAACBE/mqvKANz3o5M/s1600/Neonfly_artwork.jpg)\u000a\u000a* **Album with Best Lyrics** [Noble Beast - Noble Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPn2e5zG1Lk)\u000a\u000a&gt;It's a time of hate and fear\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;Full of misery and pain\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;But I look into your eyes my friend\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;And I know it's not in vain\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;For amidst insanity\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;We must cling to our humanity\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;For all of our brothers\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;And all of the others\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;We will never falter\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;With righteous flame we burn\u000a\u000a\u000a* **Singer of the Year** - [Marc Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQPWAJWAYNQ)\u000a\u000aEven though i think he's the best this year, i still can't decide if he's better than ZP Theart\u000a\u000a\u000a* **Lifetime Achievement Award To blablabla...*** [Fabio Lione for doing amazing shit with Angra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1bO3jV74IY)\u000a\u000a\u000a* **Mightiest Warrior** - [Fabio Lione](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1bO3jV74IY)\u000a\u000aHe can literally sing everything, everywhere and i love when he sings live.

Thanks dude.

aV**Best Album:** Primal Fear - Delivering the Black\u000a\u000aI go with what has been an album I kept going back to over and over again throughout the year. Honorable mention to Falconer's Black Moon Rising and Freedom Call's Beyond\u000a\u000a**Best Song:** Hammerfall - Hector's Hymn\u000a\u000aThis song brought me back to Hammerfall after their last album.\u000a\u000a**Song With Best Solo:** N/A\u000a\u000a**Best Unsigned Release:** Noble Beast - Noble Beast\u000a\u000aNothing really blew me away for this category, even Noble Beast. Although they were the most memorable of the bunch I did hear.\u000a\u000a**Best Femail-Fronted Release:** Mindmaze - Back From the Edge\u000a\u000aI picked this solely because I got into this band and wanted more. I got that with the new album and was once again blown away by this band.\u000a\u000a**Album With Best Nonguitar Instrumentation:** Epica - The Quantum Enigma\u000a\u000aHard to not nominate this album, especially with it being one of their best.\u000a\u000a**Best Album Cover:** Timo Tolkki's Avalon - Angels of the Apocalypse\u000a\u000a**Album With Best Lyrics:** Heroes - Sabaton\u000a\u000aNo this is not a troll pick but my actual pick. There are few bands where I care of the lyrical content, bt Sabaton I want to know what they're singing about.\u000a\u000a**Singer of the Year:** Joakim Broden\u000a\u000aHonorable mention to Michael Kiske and Stu Block. Joakim doesn;t have an off day no matter what he performs on, where it is, you name it.\u000a\u000a(I also went with singers that released full-length material in the year, thus why Hansi is not mentioned)\u000a\u000a**Lifetime Achievement Award:** Kai Hansen\u000a\u000aSeriously, he's done everything. Although he didn't have the strongest Gamma Ray release (hard to recreate Powerplant) he's done everything possible in Power Metal. He even rocks it with Kiske in Unisonic, so I can't complain.\u000a\u000a**Mightiest Warrior of 2014:** Ritchie Faulkner\u000a\u000aThis guy steps into Judas Priest, with all eyes on him and he doesn't disappoint. In fact, his guitar play seems to light a fire under the entire band and they release their best album since Painkiller. Good on him for not crumbling under the pressure.\u000a\u000a**Upsword Award:** N/A\u000a\u000aI don't feel I can properly nominate for this category.
p254
aV&gt; Primal Fear - Delivering the Black\u000a\u000aI just started to listen to this album, and it's indeed quite awesome. 
p255
aVKai won the award last year, for the very reasons that you stated.  He has done it all. 
p256
aVMy apologies. I was unaware of this seeing how this is my first year voting on the awards.
p257
aVNo need to apologize. You were indeed correct in saying Kai deserves the award. 
p258
aVI liked Nostradamus a hell of a lot and Angel of Retribution is fantastic.
p259
aVI liked Nostradamus as well, but it tends to get a bad reputation from most. Angel of Retribution was a good album, but I feel it's forgettable after the first 3-4 tracks.
p260
aV**Best Album:** [Galneryus \u2013 Vetelgyus]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv05oHDjus4)\u000a\u000aThis was a tough decision as there wasn\u2019t a huge, standout album for me but Falconer \u2013 Black Moon Rising and Galneryus \u2013 Vetelgyus are the two albums I\u2019ve been listening to all year so it\u2019s only fair I vote for one of them. I adore Mathias Blad\u2019s singing and Black Moon Rising is such a fucking good song but I found Vetelgyus more consistently enjoyable.\u000a\u000a**Best Song:** [Falconer - Black Moon Rising]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv05oHDjus4)\u000a\u000aChoosing the best song was even harder than choosing the best album. I figure that Black Moon Rising is probably the new release I have listened to the most this year, and being the fantastic song that it is, deserved this prize more than any other.\u000a\u000a\u000a**Song With Best Solo:** N/A\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a**Best Unsigned Release:** [Disforia \u2013 Age of Ether]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NCwW_lblwI)\u000a\u000aApparently Noble Beasts album is very good. I haven\u2019t actually listened to more than two of the songs though so my vote goes to Disforia for their album Age of the Ether. Every track on this album is fantastic and very atmospheric. It tells an awesome story, has fantastic keyboards and Hansi Kursch being a guest vocalist on one song really helps it stand out.  Runner up was Elderoth - Mystic\u000a\u000a\u000a**Best Female-fronted Release:** [Ancient Bards - A New Dawn Ending]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHsZmsIOYXc)\u000a\u000aThis was a pretty easy one for me, although there have been some amazing female fronted releases this year (Triosphere, Mind Maze &amp; A Sound of Thunder to name a few) this album tops them all and the symphonic metal elements really sold this album to me more than the others and made it one of my favourites of 2014.\u000a\u000a**Album With Best Non-guitar Instrumentation:** [Galneryus \u2013 Vetelgyus]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KN3ju3xPmo)\u000a\u000aMy two favourite non guitar instruments in anything ever are the violin and the keyboard. Unfortunately I haven\u2019t paid a huge amount of attention to exactly how good every bands instruments were but I really like Galneryus\u2019 Vetelgyus and it has some damn good keyboard in it so it gets my vote.\u000a\u000a**Best Album Cover:** [Falconer \u2013 Black Moon Rising]( http://planetmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Falconer-Black-Moon-Rising-album-cover.jpg)\u000a\u000aI wasn\u2019t paying much attention to album art either but this one is pretty cool. Runner up goes to [Sonata Arctica \u2013 Pariah\u2019s Child]( http://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Sonata-Arctica-Pariahs-Child.jpg) because it was so damn satisfying and reassuring to see a wolf back on the cover of a Sonata Arctica album and [Melodius Deite - Voyage Through the World of Fantasy]( http://www.inazumaprod.com/userdata/gfx/36cf54bbe8ef8adcc1f128f365a77845.jpg) because it makes me so gosh darn happy to look at it.\u000a\u000a**Singer Of The Year:** Hansi Kursh\u000a\u000aHe may only have released a single this year but I can\u2019t help giving him my vote for best vocals (and will continue to every year till he wins it). Runner up goes to Sara Squadrani of Ancient Bards.\u000a\u000a\u000a**Album with Best Lyrics:** N/A\u000a\u000a\u000a**Lifetime Achievement Award:** [Fabio Lione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Lione)\u000a\u000aAlthough his release this year with Angra wasn\u2019t stellar Fabio has been a huge figure in the power metal scene. His involvement in so many successful ventures in power metal scene have made him an inspiration. He also has some fantastic hair.\u000a\u000a\u000a**Mightiest Warrior Of 2014:** N/A\u000a\u000a\u000a**Upsword Award for Best User:** /u/MisterMillennia\u000a\u000aI considered /u/SinuataBouquet &amp; /u/unlosthorizon &amp; /u/mushmancat for the weekly releases threads but considering how often the job has switched hands I think it\u2019s unfair to give it to only one of them (also /u/unlosthorizon got it last year so we can hardly give it to him twice). MisterMillenia has been extremely consistent, interesting and informative in his weekly analysis posts and deserves this award more than anyone else. We better be getting him a cool flair or something.

aV* **Best Album** - [Noble Beast - Noble Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPRDE17-xIQ) - I can only hope for this album to get some recognition and somehow become a benchmark of what power metal will be in the future but i know that it won't. This album, was a sigh of relief in a sea of power metal shit, riffs for days, solos for days, amazing baritone vocals (thank god), and to my very welcome surprise, no pussy ass ballad crap, the album flows perfectly and so does my head-banging. I won't say it's perfect, but it's by far the best power metal album this year.\u000a\u000a* **Best Song** - [Dark Forest - Secret Commonwealth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAfcLfIydck) - I am positive this will never win but, my god, this song is amazing! and for the least power metal reasons, don't get me wrong, it's power metal for sure, the melodies are amazing and the songs consistently delivers guitar work, drumming and a variety of melodies that completes the song into an extremely enjoyable tune, there is always something going on and, most importantly, in a genre filled with bands, albums and songs that always want to do more instrumentation and be louder and be "bigger", this a shining example where less is more. Kudos to Dark Forest for creating an amazing album this year.\u000a\u000a* **Song With Best Solo** - [Jupiter - Last Moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4t_P6kKXEk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m35s) - I may be an asshole when it comes to JPM but i like to think that I am a fair asshole and I like to give credit where credit is due, JPM is not devoid of talent by any means, they just make very questionable musical choices and end up with a myriad of bad songs with the occasional shining moments. This is one of them... A sucky sucky song with an awesome solo. It's just that, it sucks for a whole 3 minutes but then the there's a good buildup to the solo and then BAM! kick-ass solo!... and then is sucks again for the rest of the song. Think of it as a really boring roller coaster, but then it starts to go faster and BOOM it starts to go up and down and sideways at 200 km/h, does 3 barrel rolls, 2 front flips and 1 and half front flip and then it comes to an halt... and you die. That's this song.\u000a\u000a* **Best Unsigned Release** - [Noble Beast - Noble Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPRDE17-xIQ) - It just is. \u000a\u000a* **Best Female-fronted release** - [Ancient Bards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIWmCPeVZSM) - It's a good album, very dramatic sometimes, she sings amazingly in my opinion.\u000a\u000a* **Album With Best Nonguitar Instrumentation** - [Adamantra - Act II - Silent Narratives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e756WPVJoDQ) - I'm with /u/mushmancat on this one, really sweet keyboarding going on here, the album is nothing spectacular.\u000a\u000a* **Best Album Cover** - [Alestorm - Sunset on the Golden Age](https://burningfist.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/alestorm-sunset-on-the-golden-age.jpg) - Fun album by a fun band, i think the album cover is really cool.\u000a\u000a* **Album With Best Lyrics** - [Sabaton - Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYWdgBtSM8s) - Cause /u/UnlostHorizon.\u000a\u000a* **Singer Of The Year** - [Kiske](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92_XyoAGprc) - You all have heard the man, needs no explanation.\u000a\u000a* **/r/PowerMetal Lifetime Achievement Award To An Individual For Outstanding Contribution To Power Metal** - [Fabio Lione](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVs9vUej_L4) - The fucker is everywhere and does a ton for power metal and he is always consistent. He is almost always a plus in all bands he sings.\u000a\u000a* **Mightiest Warrior Of 2014** - [Broden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgSehsHOUdo) - Awesome stage presence, seeing this guy live is just fucking amazing. Sabaton is beyond overrated and have an impressive repertoire of fodder songs but, this guy does his best to make them shine and seems to always pull off an impressive performance.\u000a\u000a* **/r/PowerMetal Upsword Award To A User For Contribution To The Subreddit** - /u/Fazermint - I have a ton of respect for /u/MisterMillennia but, in my opinion, he just straight up likes 95% of all releases and i end up only liking 5% of all releases, [so reading his reviews for me is kinda pointless](http://i.imgur.com/1l5cpe5.gif). /u/Fazermint are a lot of fun to read and i hope he continues, even if it's moving at a snail's pace.

p280
aVOh, They are definitely similar.  More than just the vocals too.  This album is what I felt The Days of Grey should have been. 
p281
aV&gt;This album is what I felt The Days of Grey should have been.\u000a\u000aI agree and at the same time disagree because I actually thought The Days Of Grays was a very interesting album albeit weird and confusing. Took me multiple listens to actually start enjoying the album, more than any album I have ever listened to.
p282
aVMaybe i'll go revisit it today. Its been a long time. 
p283
aVJust don't think that it's a power metal album because it really isn't, each song fits different genres, the genres that make sense for the emotion conveyed. In my opinion, that is what makes this album so special to me.

aVyes, im not alone in my obsession with this song.
p294
aVBest Debut, perhaps?
p295
aVI feel like this is a good idea. There's a lot of unsigned releases that are not debuts.\u000a\u000aHence, best debut should be a separate category and best unsigned releases should exclude debuting bands?
p296

p305
aVI presume it means the song that had the best insrumentation if you were to ignore the guitar parts of the song.
p306
aVYeah, so I'm thinking keyboards (if present) and drums would be the main elements that are being judged\u000a\u000aalthough I guess a bomb-ass bass line would work too?

asVThis Week in Power Metal Releases (2/23 - 3/1)
p330
(lp331
VAnother week, more power metal! Excellent, let's get to it.\u000a\u000a**Furyon: Lost Salvation** - Calculatedly written mainstream rock, it's the same formula you hear on radio all the time, it's boring.\u000a\u000a**Crimson Wind: Last Poetry Line** - If you haven't heard of these guys, their first album showed some promise but ultimately felt flat. This song showcases what I tend to dislike in symphonic based acts, the pristine keyboarding eclipsing the guitar. It's not a bad song by all means, it's the never ending sense of déjà vu constantly popping on these new symphonic power metal songs. \u000a\u000a**The Storyteller: Sacred Fire** - Biggest problem with this band is the name, when you name your band "The Storyteller" you build this minor expectation that a story will be told but a story is never told. The song is just okay but the vocalist stands out and I always have been a fan of him and I always wondered how much better he would sound in other bands.\u000a\u000a**Evertale: Of Dragons and Elves** - Ah yes, Evertale... the oh-so praised band that released this majestic 90s Blind Guardian worship album that kicked multiple bare backs and melted faces. I can give you my opinion on the full album rather than the song because I listened to it quite a bit. The album is 80 minutes long and it should instead clock in at 40 to 50 minutes meaning there's a lot of fat to be cut here; another problem is the chaotic musicianship going on here; ever heard of Slayer being called chaotic? That's because they're songs often had these [moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Wnn47V09Q2M#t=170) of pure guitar and drum noise and even some [riffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeAV3LTNGks) where a complete mess but worked wonders. This album on the other hand is "bad chaos", there are a lot of moments on the album that just sounds like they went insane and decided to mix all music samples the mixing program could muster and create this wall of messy sound. In the end, I highly recommend this album because it has a lot of neat ideas and this song is pretty good.\u000a\u000a**Wolfpakk: Rise of the Animal** - Have you ever noticed how Sonata Arctica are obsessed with wolves? Well, these guys seem even more obsessed except they suck. Boring overdone Heavy Metal track. Not even going to talk about how stupid the name of the song is, sounds like a quote coming out of a Worms game.\u000a\u000a**Enforcer: From Beyond** - Sweden speed junkies made a pretty good album in 2010 called Diamonds (totally deserves a check). This song sounds a tad safer than usual but it's a good song nonetheless. It has this weird segment in the middle of the song that I think is really cool.\u000a\u000a**Trauma: Rapture and Wrath** - Well, everything is pretty fucking good but the vocalist just lacks in power, this song needed that screaming voice, that powerful punch to the ear because seriously, the guitars rule. Even the guitar overall production needed a bit more of "intensification" but I just can't get past the vocals. Worth a check, it's not power metal though.\u000a\u000a**Forces United: II** - Vapid Stratovarius ripoff. Apparently it's an international project or some shit but I don't know anybody. There is some truly mediocre keyboards de-harmonizing(?) this bullshit Eurovision song.\u000a\u000a[MRW I have no appropriate gif for anything](http://i.imgur.com/XZCF9Ue.gif)
p332
aVGlad to see Evertale getting a reissue, but I still think it'll be hard to acquire in North America at a decent price. With that said, I'd like to hear it, but it's too long for my tastes so I'll pass.\u000a\u000aI'm looking forward to Enforcer's album. I don't think they'll be able to live up to Diamonds, but if this is anything like the last one, it should be pretty solid.\u000a\u000aThe Evil Invaders album is pretty good. I actually had higher expectations for it, but any fan of speed metal should be satisfied with it. [Here's](http://skullfracturingmetal.blogspot.ca/2015/02/evil-invaders-pulses-of-pleasure.html) my review if anyone is interested.
p333
aVSo weird, I was literally listening to Enforcer yesterday and said they were due for a new album.  Sadly that song didn't excite me too much.  A step down from Death by Fire would be understandable though, because it was such a good album. \u000a\u000aAn Evertale reissue is interesting. Is it better production or something?  That was actually one of my favorite albums the year it originally came out, so I will have to check this out. 
p334
aVMy first time hearing Enforcer, I will check Death by Fire out.\u000a\u000aAnd as far as I know the Evertale releases are identical. I could be wrong, but I couldn't find any official promotional vids

p338
aVIt was me. It was always meeee.
p339
aVI'm really excited for the new Enforcer. I'm still mesmerized by their last album but I'm hoping this one is just as good.\u000a\u000aTrauma I'm looking forward to aswell, seeing as their one of the older of the bunch. More USPM oriented and their debut *Scratch and Scream* is quite notable. Seems they went into a more trad/speed direction according to their new song.\u000a\u000aEvil Invaders is horrible. The vox are just...bland 80s thrash. This is coming from a guy who is love with a lot 80s thrash but this is bad. It's mediocre at best to me.\u000a\u000aEvertale had something last year and just dropped the ball to me. The rest of their music just didn't deliver, so I'm not really looking forward to the reissue.

aVI was just going through metallum to find the status of melodic death/power metal band (Luna Mortis), and came across this. I thought, "Power metal/black? I need to see what it sounds like!"

aV2015 /r/powermetal singer of the year.\u000a\u000aThis is really good :-)
p380
aVMan, this is awesome! I'm going to try imitating Hansi too!
p381
aVTiming a little off and a few notes aren't quite pitch perfect but it's still impressive. Always love a good wail. Keep on it dude \u005cm/
p382
aVAs a singer who's been taking lessons for two years and wishes he wasn't a baritone...\u000a\u000a\u000aNice. \u000a\u000a\u000aGet a better mic. T_T
p383
aVHansi is a pretty classic baritone (C2-A5ish, if I recall correctly).\u000a\u000aAnd being a baritone for power metal is perfect. Most vocalists are. And you can probably hit some of the higher notes just fine :-)
p384
aVReally? Huh. I guess it's a different problem. I run into this thing where it FEELS like I'm hitting the pitch but it feels like these guys are still singing higher than me. If you're a power metal singer, mind if I PM you and ask your advice? 
p385
asVBruce Dickinson - Accident of Birth (I love how Bruce sings on this).
p386
(lp387
VI absolutely adore Bruce's solo stuff. I actually listen to it much more than Maiden. *(Though, to be fair, that's partly because I overloaded on Maiden when I was younger, then starting exploring other stuff.)*\u000a\u000aAccident of Birth is a goddamn masterpiece. Omega is my personal favorite.
p388
aVNever heard omega will have to pick it up 
p389
aVIt's one of those Stairway to Heaven type tracks. It starts out with a pretty nice acoustic bit then it builds and builds into a big sweeping climax with a wicked solo.\u000a\u000aFreakin awesome subject matter too. It's about how inevitably (over hundreds of billions of years, mind you) our sun is going to grow then scorch/swallow the earth. It's really easy to get into as a power metal fan.\u000a\u000a&gt;The sun that gave us life yesterday\u000a\u000a&gt; is the sun that takes our lives away\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxqQT3UvXkM

asVNightwish new album title revealed: Endless Forms Most Beautiful
p397
(lp398
VIt seems to be a conceptual album about evolution. That would explain the guest appearance from Richard Dawkins. An unusual topic for a power metal band. More I hear about this album, the more interesting it sounds. 
p399
aVSomeone bothered to downvote for some reason but you're right.  It's definitely a reference to the final sentence of Origin of Species. \u000a\u000a"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."
p400
aVNightwish becomes euphoric *tips top hat*
p401
aVPlease don't.
p402
aVDefinitely a very Nightwish-y title. 
p403
aVEndless Forms Grow Her Name. 
p404
aVStill makes more sense than the actual title.
p405
aVInteresting title to say the least. Whatever, it's the least of my worries.\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso can I just say how awesome it is that we're getting both a new Nightwish and Blind Guardian album next year? 
p406
aVDon't forget Kamelot
p407
aVAnd Luca Turilli's Rhapsody.
p408
aVI'll be honest, I'd rather a new Roy Khan solo album than a new Kamelot one. Not that they're *bad* without him, but...
p409
aVKhan was good with Conception.  Also, try listening to Between Visions and Lies by Black Fate.  The dude is kind of like a Khan copycat.\u000a\u000aAnyway, until Khan hops off the crazy bus I don't think he's making music.
p410
aVWell, I hope it's better than the name suggests it will be...
p411
aVFloor's contributions to Ayreon were respectable, and the pre-reviews (?) have been fairly positive. I'm confident this won't be disastrous.\u000a\u000aAs far as Nightwish goes, this is the most hyped I've been for a Nightwish album in a long time. My hopes are high.
p412
aVUgh,, what an awful title. 
p413
aVMy most anticipated album of next year. 
p414
aVThe album art looks awful, dull and dreary. How non-Nightwish.
p415
aVThis is the most pumped I've been for a new Nightwish album in quite sometime.  Floor is the best of Tarja and Anete in one package.  I'm looking forward to hearing what she has to bring to table.  I'm also curious to see how folky they're going to get with Troy on pipes.
p416

p417
aVKai is the drummer on this album. 
p418

p419

p428
aVHave they started working on another one after Outbound?
p429

p434
aVSee ya there :-)\u000a\u000aI've made it my 2015 metal goal to see Falconer as much as possible this year. Definitely going to ProgPower and moving to Stockholm in April, so I'll be able to hit up Rockstad Falun in August. \u000a\u000aNot doing Wacken, unfortunately.
p435
aVYou lucky, lucky bastard.  All of my favorite metal these days is from Sweden it seems!  Love that new Hammerfall record.
p436
aVDepends on what you consider 'lucky'. I'm taking like a 50% paycut to move to Stockholm because I'm bored and need a change of scenery.\u000a\u000aBut I guess being in a position to even consider doing that does make me lucky. Hmm. . .
p437
aVThat will be quite an adjustment.  I wish you the best fellow metalhed!  Yes, I'll see you at ProgPower.  I'll be the one with the black jacket on....
p438
aV&gt; last falconer live show ever.\u000a\u000aWhat? Nooooo. 
p439
aVThai is how ProgPower is billing it...and the promoters of that show are "in the know."  Band says they were originally conceived as studio only and began playing live to satisfy demand from fans.  Which is understandable.  But that they are busy with family and the touring just doesn't fit.  They promised more Falconer before its all said and done though so I'm happy.

p445
aVSpace Police is my favorite Edguy album. 
p446
aVThis is controversial? It's a damn good album!
p447
aVNot sure if it's controversial, but a lot of people bitched about it on this sub when it came out. 
p448
aVAgreed. My favourite album of theirs since Hellfire Club.
p449
aVI'm tired of every fucking "symphonic" band being fronted by a female singer. Nightwish is the only band I can stand in that category. 
p450
aVFor me, there's no difference between Nightwish and every other symphonic female fronted band. They all sounds the same
p451
aVThat's true for me as well.\u000a\u000aWhich I suppose is a good thing; if I wan't a symphonic female fronted band, I don't ever have to look very hard.
p452
aVSymphonic metal has a bit of a "hip" status, so I feel like a lot of these bands sound overly commercial, just picking a female singer even though she doesn't have a voice suited for metal. The only male-fronted symphonic metal bands I can think of are Kamelot and Serenity... There are some good female-fronted ones besides Nightwish, but I definitely agree that the genre is dominated by mediocrity.
p453
aVRhapsody...rhapsody is essentially what I use as the definition of symphonic metal. Whether it be Luca Turilli's Rhapsody or Rhapsody of Fire, they are symphonic metal in complete form. Definitely my favorite groups in the genre...
p454
aVDamnation Angels is pretty good
p455
aVDid you body slam your midterms, or did your midterms body slam you? :P\u000a\u000aI generally don't care about lyrics, because music is a terrible medium for telling stories. I usually can't make out what they're singing for an entire song, rendering the overall lyrics hazy at best. Most of the lyrical themes bore me. For example, while I greatly enjoy fantasy novels, fantasy-based lyrics end up being cheesy and generic. You can't tell a good fantasy story in such a short duration. And if it's not fantasy, then it's some kind of sentiment that I don't give a crap about. Singing about hardships, negative emotions? Fuck that, I listen to PM to get cheered up. Some other kind of convoluted meaning? Fuck that, I'm not in the mood to analyze your shit by looking up the lyrics.
p456
aVI think i t depends on the band. Someone like Hammerfall is a band I listen to when I just want to be happy, but a band like Brainstorm, I'll listen to the lyrics because they sound different from the norm.\u000a\u000aThat and any band that goes out of their way to make a story that's halfway understandable (Avantasia) gets lyrical attention from me.\u000a\u000aThe gif though; it basically shows "I doing well/I'm going to rock these/Why are you moving.....splat!" (ie not good)
p457
aVI definitely have similar problems with being unable to understand lyrics during a song, I have no idea how some people are able to do it without even trying\u000a\u000a

p463
aVI usually pay attention to lyrics, and if songs have cringeworthy lyrics I really won't like them for long.
p464
aVIf you are looking for quality lyrics in power metal, you won't find any.

p467
aVYeah, it certainly isn't, but it'll sweep the next awards just like Hansi did this year. 
p468
aVHeck, not even Album of the month for January.
p469
aVI thought that at first.  But it is an album you really need to pay attention to and listening to everything closely.  With good audio.
p470
aVthat's almost as watertight as the "you need to learn to enjoy this ~~food~~ ~~drink~~ album
p471
aVIt doesn't mean you will like it for sure. But it does help; there is a lot going on in this album with a lot of subtleties.
p472
aVFor me it's quire opossite. When i first heard Beyond the Red Mirror i was like [this](http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/aBKVLED_460sa.gif) but then i was just skipping Blind Guardian when i was listening to music from my playlist.
p473
aVFor some reason, most of BG is like that for me. I didn't enjoy At the Edge of Time when I first heard it either.
p474
aVWhat else is billed for release this year that could take it's throne?
p475
aVOther than Visigoth already having done so?\u000a\u000aTheocracy\u000a\u000aRhapsody\u000a\u000aHeavenly(Its gotta be this year, right?)\u000a\u000aManilla Road(I know its out, but I haven't heard it yet)\u000a\u000a
p476
aVIn addition to those, Kamelot\u000a\u000aMaybe Pyramaze from what they've been hinting at since October
p477
aV[oh boy](http://i.imgur.com/wABFJsK.gif)
p478
aVcan heavenly please be this year? :(
p479
aVTheocracy? Maybe. They had a few really good songs on their latest album, but there was some inconsistency. Which Rhapsody? Heavenly pls.
p480
aVWhich Rhapsody? The only one that matters. 
p481
aVTurilli's. I think it's due somewhere around the half year mark.  
p482
aVI've been feeling kinda burnt out at work this week. Tonight, I was staring at my screen, unable to force myself to write some really simple code, and then Amaranthe started playing, and I actually didn't mind it. I was even able to finish off the thing I was working on.\u000a\u000a...\u000a\u000aAm I dying?
p483
aVI like Amaranthe :|
p484
aVI finally got around to listening to Pathfinder, and what a disappointment. Do we really need another DragonForce? 
p485
aVI don't like Pathfinder either, but I don't think they sound very much like dragonforce (other than the wankery)
p486
aVpathfinder's first album was much better, disappointed with the second album and they're gonna disappear cause their new singer blows
p487
aVI'm sick of people being snobbish about songs that are "too poppy." The vast majority of metal, power metal especially, follows the "pop" verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus, and is upheld by a cool riff/motif or catchy refrain. I hate to break this to you, people, but Avantasia's "Dying for an Angel" has basically the same structure as "The Wicked Symphony." AND THAT'S OKAY. Not every song has to be a bloody symphony.\u000a\u000aOh, and on the topic of Nightwish, I think that Imaginaerum is far superior to Wishmaster.
p488
aVI used to enjoy Michael Kiske, now his vibrato makes me want to KILL ALL HUMANS.\u000a\u000aAlso fuck Sabaton. #mushmansolidarity
p489
aVOh man, Kiske has one vocal technique and it gets old real quick
p490
aVYeah. He was great on the Keeper albums but he did get old. 
p491
aVI don't like old stratovarius (episode, visions and destiny included) still haven't bothered listening to Lost Horizon (mainly because their stuff is hard to find on youtube and not on spotify) and think Beyond by Freedom Call was the best power metal album of 2014
p492
aVI was listening to "Episode" recently, and honestly, I think if it weren't for the fact that Stratovarius was so early on the scene, they wouldn't be as big as they are today. I love their last two albums, as well as Visions, and enjoy the remaining ones, but for me, they don't stack up against certain other bands in the genre.
p493
aVBoth Lost Horizon albums are on spotify. At least in the US. 
p494
aVThey aren't in Australia for some reason\u000a\u000aEDIT:\u000aNevermind looks like they got added recently. Guess I'll have to finally listen to these guys
p495
aVWelcome to the greatest day of your life. 
p496
aVBattle Beast is generic as fuck, can't believe they are getting bigger.  
p497
aVI haven't heard their new album, but I wouldn't call their older stuff generic. Gritty female vocals are at least a novelty.\u000a\u000aBut assuming they are generic, more generic =&gt; more general appeal. So it would make sense for them to be getting bigger.
p498
aVI think Triosphere is overrated. 
p499
aV[Oh really?](http://thumbs.newschoolers.com/index.php?src=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rwro8doozUw/T755eP-AslI/AAAAAAAABPU/nCWLy9hg7Dg/s1600/triple-h-angry.gif&amp;size=400x1000)
p500
aVI actually like Dragonforce's newest album, for me since the new singer joined they are getting better.\u000a\u000aI enjoy Edguy's Space Police a lot, they still deliver their brand of good music with stupid and entertaining lyrics. And I've kind of accepted that any *serious* music is going to come from Avantasia from now on. \u000a\u000aI do not enjoy listening to Blind Guardian with the exception of two or three songs, and God knows I tried with Beyond the Red Mirror, I think they do choruses really well. But a chorus is only a part of a song and I felt bored just waiting for a chorus the majority of my time.\u000a\u000aAnd this is my first post..... Hi....
p501
aVI don't see what's the deal with Noble Beats. It's not a bad album, but nothing spectacular, in my opinion. It might be the singer, I don't like his voice too much. 
p502
aV[deleted]
p503
aVNo one is talking about Angra, maybe it's just me that's missing on all online and offline discussions because I haven't seen anyone talking about Angra latest album. Do I have shit in my ears? Isn't the album amazing?\u000a\u000aI know, they're lineup is inconsistent and everybody kinda thought they had split or something but did they lost all of their relevancy? Honestly, they're a very unique band in power metal and they are splendid musicians. Everyone says it's either Visigoth or Blind Guardian who have current best power metal album this year, I say it's Angra.
p504
aVI just haven't heard it (outside of the single) which may explain why I haven't heard/seen anything.
p505
aVNew Angra isn't bad. It's just nothing special and it's hard to get excited about it :/
p506
aVI can honestly say that the new Angra bored me to tears. 
p507
aVI hope Roy Khan never comes back just to spite the people who have to chime in about Khan in every remotely Kamelot or Black Fate related thread.
p508
aVBut but... I miss Roy =(
p509
aVI think most power metal bands are incredibly bland, have weak vocals, bad mixing or just no unique sound. Even a lot of popular ones like Stratovarius, Freedom Call, or Hammerfall (the list could go on, but I only enjoy like 5% of the subs front page). \u000a\u000aA lot of bands have too much going on as well so it feels like I'm being bombarded with garble and instruments that are fighting each other to be heard.\u000a\u000a15 years of power metal later and I still mainly listen to Rhapsody, with episodes of other stuff.\u000a\u000aAlso I'm not a fan of Hansi's vocals.
p510
aVI hate everything to do with dragonforce and I think they are the bane of this genre. I will not listen to a single second when I go to see kamelot in a few months.

And though he be now their foe, are not they and he of one kin? Vengeance calls me hence, but even were it otherwise, I would not dwell longer in the same land with the kin of my father's slayer and the thief of my treasure. Yet I am not the only valiant in this valiant people. And have ye not all lost your king? And what else have ye not lost, cooped here in a narrow land between the jealous mountains and the harvestless Sea? Here once was light, that the Valar begrudged to Middle-earth, but now dark levels all. Shall we mourn here deedless for ever, a shadow-folk, mist-haunting, dropping vain tears in the salt thankless Sea? Or shall we go home? In Kuiviénen sweet ran the waters under unclouded stars, and wide lands lay about where a free folk might walk. There they lie still and await us who in our folly forsook them. Come away! Let the cowards keep this city. But by the blood of Finwë! unless I dote, if the cowards only remain, then grass will grow in the streets. Nay, rot, mildew, and toadstool. ...Fair shall the end be though long and hard shall be the road! Say farewell to bndage! But say farewell also to ease! Say farewell to the weak! Say farewell to your treasures - more still shall we make! Journey light. But bring with you your swords!

There long shall ye abide and yearn for your bodies and find little pity though all whom ye have slain should entreat for you.

aVI just heard that Andreas Blomqvist's family just had their second child, so I'm not sure how much time he's had to write...he seems to be one of the driving forces behind that band...
p536
aVSilverthorn was october 2012 and now we get Haven. The Great Escape was 2010 and we STILL dont have a release date for the new SW.... its a bittersweet feeling.
p537
aVSW?
p538
aVSeventh Wonder :) a.k.a the greatest prog/power band in the world.
p539
aVLink your 3 favorite songs for me =D
p540
aVWell, first off we have [Destiny Calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wy8B42G3vQ), really  great intro and fantastic vocals. Then we have [One Last Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEK9-9emkEA), a really beautiful ballad (Tommy is seriously amazing with ballads). And finally, the greatest song i have ever heard. I recommend you sit down with the lyrics and actually listen through it, cause it is really worth it. [The Great Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMjO7y-98Ak) Its 30 minutes but there isnt one wasted minute.
p541
aVI'd recommend listening to their album 'Mercy Falls' in full, beginning to end for the greatest impact. The first two songs max linked actually come towards the end of that, and have some pretty big spoilers for the story of the album.
p542
aVCan't wait. Kamelot is my favorite band, and this will be the first album of theirs I'll be present for upon release.
p543
aVI am scared...
p544
aVI'm really excited, but I'm really waiting on my favorite band Seventh Wonder to put out another masterpiece... Although, if Haven will be like anything like Silverthorn or better, I'd be very happy! 
p545
aVSo the song titles presented by Youngblood and this website...it looks like the new album is another concept album, this time with a dystopian theme. Anyone else seeing this?
p546
aVI'm hoping that with this album we can see karevik's vocals becoming more like his own style, rather than the material for Silverthorn which sounded like it was written for Khan (and from what I've heard it was)
p547
aVMy understanding is that the instrumentals were already written, and Tommy wrote his own melodies. While I imagine Tommy being better integrated into the band will have the music being written more with his voice in mind, I don't think it will, nor should, result in Tommy using something reflecting his Seventh Wonder vocal style. Kamelot has its sound, and Seventh Wonder has its sound - these are rather distinct for various reasons, so Tommy going in with a style better suited for a very proggy band wouldn't really work.\u000a\u000aTommy had to bend his voice to work with the Kamelot's already established sound, and I think that worked well on Silverthorn. People say he became a Khan-clone or whatever, but I don't see that at all. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTjaSGeypZ4) is what a Khan-clone sounds like. I imagine many of the same people would be complaining and saying that Tommy ruined the band if he went with a Seventh Wonder-style. 
p548
aVMy problem with Karevik on Silverthorn wasn't that he didn't sound enough like he does on Seventh Wonder, it's just that he didn't seem to be really singing like he wanted to. He puts a lot of emotion into his Seventh Wonder work just like how khan put a lot of emotion into his kamelot work and I felt like that was missing on Silverthorn. \u000aThat said I still think that his singing was really good, just not as good as it could have been.
p549
aVThis is a matter of subjectivity and perception, so all I can say to that is that I thought Tommy matched even Khan's more emotional moments with his performance on Silverthorn.
p550
aVReally hate that the album is coming out after my live date. They will undoubtedly play some new material, and live shows are so loud and bassy that it's really difficult to hear the music if you don't know it already, so the new songs will be wasted on me.  :(
p551
aVI may be in the minority, but Silverthorn didn't light my world on fire like previous Kamelot albums have (not since Ghost Opera, but still) so I'm a tad skeptical on what it'll be like.
p552
aVAlright, I'm a bit late to this party, but I've got a theory. \u000a\u000aKamelot's album quality follows a sine-wave-like pattern. They started off low with their first vocalist. Khan signed up and they started to improve, hitting their peak somewhere around Epica or The Black Halo. Then they started getting worse going to "solid but not great" with Ghost Opera and hitting their lowest point at Poetry for the Poisoned. Now that Tommy's on board, we're starting to go into an upswing. Silverthorn was to Kaverik as Karma or The Fourth Legacy was to Khan. \u000a\u000aIt's all uphill from here guys. Nothing bad's ever gonna happen again with Kamelot. \u000a\u000a***Nothing bad. Ever again***
p553
aVVery excited to hear more Kamelot, especially with Tommy. Silverthorn really grew on me over time. I don't love the cover or the title, feels a little too goth, but I'm holding out hope.
p554
aVSeems pretty legit. Hard to get too excited though, they've not delivered with Silverthorn and Poetry for the Poisoned IMHO. 
p555
aVI think it's really exciting, even though I didn't like silverthorn. 
p556
asVLooking for Suggestions - Power Metal With Backbone?
p557
(lp558
V&gt;The same can be said from what I've seen of Blind Guardian\u000a\u000aI'm sort of surprised that you would say this of Blind Guardian. They are largely inspired by fantasy, but their lyrics deal often with the best of fantasy literature, along with mythology and similar topics. Hansi very often does a great job of conveying the emotion behind these works - he isn't just making bland use of fantasy tropes. Furthermore, he often does branch out from these themes. A Night at the Opera has songs about Galileo and Nietzsche. A Twist in the Myth has songs about personality disorders and dreams. Religion and science fiction are common themes throughout their albums, and At the Edge of Time has a song about a political treatise in the context of the English Civil War. Even when dealing with fantasy or mythology, Hansi usually is able to bring in some new perspective - for example, 'Under the Ice,' a song about a story from Greek mythology, contains heavy feminist themes. No, he's not Shakespeare, but I'd say his lyrics are easily among the best in the genre. \u000a\u000aAnd I'd say the same thing about Nightwish as well. Yes, they've also delved heavily into fantasy. But their songs also extend well beyond that, and if you pay attention to the lyrics there's a lot of emotional depth to them. They certainly shouldn't be included with the likes of DragonForce or Rhapsody.\u000a\u000aAll that said, I would recommend checking out Angra, Dark Moor, Edguy, Kamelot, Demons &amp; Wizards, Disforia, Judicator, Sonata Arctica, Keldian, Masterplan, Symphony X, Falconer, and Triosphere.\u000a\u000a\u000aSince you brought up Ayreon's The Human Equation, I'll recommend a few prog metal bands you'd probably like as well:\u000a\u000aSeventh Wonder, Haken, Porcupine Tree, Devin Townsend.
p559
aVThe Wicked Trilogy by Avantasia is a fairly abstract trio of concept albums, which may be what you're looking for. the music is somewhat in the vein of Ayreon too so there's a good chance you'll like them
p560
aVWas gonna say Avantasia.  Or Edguy. \u000aIf you're looking For deep meaning, i highly recommended Dream Theater. They'll blow your mind. \u000aSome other favorites include Kamelot, Demons &amp; Wizards, Nocturnal Rites to name a few.
p561
aVI love all the bands you mentioned, so definitely good choices, although not sure about nocturnal rites with regards to their lyrics
p562
aVYa I guess. Still an amazing band. I Kind of ventured away from the story telling aspect he is looking for. \u000aFirst band that comes to mind is Blind Guardian. They have some great tales Haha.
p563
aVYou listened to Sabaton?\u000a\u000aThey sing about War.\u000a\u000aMass human loss and suffering is pretty substantial I think, more than fantasy settings.\u000a\u000aIf you're looking for some philosophical symphonies from the Plato of Power metal, however, I'm not sure I can help.

aVThe new Judicator album is about the singer's brother who died from cancer years ago and the effect on his life.

aVSonata Arctica has plenty of song on deeper subjects, like Tallulah which is about leaving someone you love because you fear what it will be like if the relationship goes on and the love begins to dwindle. Or Letter to Dana, which is about a former friend/love who ran away from home and seeing them on the cover of a porn mag years later. "Tony" (quotes because it's not really Tony in the song, i'll just use him as an insert since he's the singer) then goes on about how he hoped she would come back (seemingly still loving her) until the porn mag incident, which killed the last of his love.\u000a\u000aThose are just two examples, there's plenty more songs from them that are deep. (What did you do in the war, dad? Love kind of counts, I have a right is about the children's right to a proper education, Alone in heaven questions Christian beliefs about heaven... I could go on and on, you get the point)\u000a\u000aSabaton sings about historic events, like the World War II, the life of king Karl (Charles/Carolus) the XII (Carolean's prayer, Carolus Rex, Long Live the King and Ruina Imperii at least tell about his and his soldiers life).\u000a\u000aAlestorm tells about the hardships as well as the glory of being a pirate. (Shipwrecked tells about exactly that, Midget saw tells about a man who had his limbs cut off for beating a monkey to death. [Quite psychotic reasoning to be honest, but when were pirates known for their mental stability] Barrett's privateers tells about privateering during the American Revolution and the hardships that brought to the singer.)\u000a\u000aSentenced has/had (as the band has been disbanded forever after Miika Tenkula died of a heart attack [from a hereditary heart disease], and the band had quit in 2005 officially, but some people were somewhat still holding out for a re-union) plenty of songs about death, suicide, depression and other such dark matters. (their first few albums are more death metal, but after the third or so i'd place them as a heavy power metal band).\u000a\u000aAri Koivunen's Angels are calling is seemingly about losing his little sister who was only 12 at the time of her death. (Ari has said that it's not specifically about her, and that everyone can fit their own story into it, but it's clear that it's more or less about his sister.)\u000a\u000aTarja's (Tarja Turunen) Boy and the ghost tells about a dead boy and (seemingly possessed by) a ghost. The boy seems to have been mistreated as the song sings about how "all he needed was a gentle heart to guide him trough the dark" and is now seemingly terrorising the town.\u000a\u000aPoisonblack, the more or less spiritual successor of Sentenced, has very similar themes to the singer Ville Laihiala's previous band (Sentenced) of death and other darker subject matters.\u000a\u000a**TL;DR**\u000a\u000aThere is plenty of power metal with a spine and darker/mature subjects, you just have to dig a little bit.\u000a\u000aBut please, do read the whole thing, it took quite a bit to write. And the bands are just from my spotify playlist, i'm sure there's plenty more songs and bands like the ones mentioned.
p571
aV&gt;Most songs don't escape vague epic fantasy platitudes. ... The same can be said from what I've seen of Blind Guardian, Stratovarius, Nightwish, and most others. \u000a\u000aWhat exactly would you consider deep then? Admittedly most of eg Blind Guardian is tales of fantasy worlds, but does that necessarily mean the theme of the song is 'shallow?\u000a\u000aWould you eg consider Sabaton deep when they sing about the psychic stress and depravities of actual wars, but not another band if they sung about the same, but from a fantasy world?
p572
aVWhile admittedly Blind Guardian does have more to offer in terms of different themes than the average power metal band, none of their songs effected me on a personal level. I find the singer doesn't portray strong emotions well, and the lyrics are too vague, often based on works I've never read. I can see why they have their fans, but one song just slips to the next when I listen to their albums.

VI have no idea, but you might want to try asking the Pathfinder Facebook page. I know Arek (Arkadiusz) and Karol are pretty active posters, especially now with the crowdfunding deal. Try asking them if Szymon's doing alright and if he's in any new projects...that sort of stuff.
p607
aVPrior to Pathfinder, Simon has put out two albums, one with *Privateer* and one with *Scrat*. The former is heavy/power, the latter is trash metal.
p608
aV&gt; the latter is **thrash** metal\u000a\u000aWhy do so many people think it's spelled without the "h"? Don't make the obvious joke!
p609
aVI honestly though the genre was called trash metal. But now that you say it, it occurs to me that they're *thrashing*\u000a\u000aIt also took me years to realize that the Pokemon move Thrash was not called Trash and had nothing to do with garbage. I literally thought they would throw garbage at the enemy, I kid you not.
p610
aV&gt; I literally thought they would throw garbage at the enemy, I kid you not.\u000a\u000aI was like that as well, until I stopped sucking at English.\u000a\u000aThrash isn't exactly a word you just pick up from watching TV, since nobody *really* uses that in every day speech.\u000a\u000aOn a side note, though. The move Gunk Shot is exactly that. In Generation 6 games, the animation is literally throwing a garbage can at the enemy.
p611
aVYeah, exactly. The phrase "thrashing about" also had me confused to think it meant throwing garbage around, lol.\u000a\u000aHah, Pokemon games are really running out of ideas! Haven't played anything past 3rd gen.

aVI thought sweat was pronounced "sweet" when I read books as a child, and I never understood what the hell it was. "Why was he covered in sweet? The hell is that?"\u000a\u000aThen I realized I was an idiot on my own.

aVAhah, covered in sweet! That's gold.

p615
aVWhat's the matter?\u000a\u000aIf you're bothered that I thought thrash metal was called trash metal, that's just an oversight on my part.\u000a\u000aIf you're bothered that I didn't know that trash and thrash were two different words when I was 10 year old non-native English speaker, I don't know what to tell you.

p640
aVSadists.
p641
aVWell I should put the song title in quotations, and then put "by [Artist]," but the entire syntactical perfectionism seems redundant on internet forums. I'd write it formally if it were a formal piece of writing like a review. I'm not promoting lazy syntax, as I'm an English major and hate poor grammar, but I feel I've sufficed in achieving the rhetorical purpose of just stating the song and artist names.
p642
aVThe main problem with writing in that order is confusing people who may not be familiar with said band/song, as Band - Song Title is the most common order.

aVAhaha, thanks for the offer, but I'm not even a metal player (yet)\u000a\u000aI play fingerstyle and such
p687
aVThe cool thing about metal is that it's an anything goes genre. Even on /r/powermetal you'll see bands that use strings, pipes, accordions, and all kinds of obscure folk instruments. There's no reason why a metal band can't accommodate fingerstyle.
p688
aVLike this song based on The Empire Strikes Back? [Star One - Master of Darkness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjB11mPtbOg)
p689
aVI want to do the same but with warhammer 40k
p690
aVTo be fair, I feel like 40K deserves to be played by heavier forms of Metal, considering the whole "Purge The Heretic" sort of themes that would go really well there.\u000a\u000aOf course, you could take it the other way, and have the band be all-Eldar and sing of the Fall of their race, or all-Tau and sing of murdering others for the Greater Good. But what kind of scum would forsake the God-Emperor for some filthy Xenos?
p691
aVI think one band's first few albums were 40k based (Bolt Thrower maybe?) and those were quite heavy.\u000a\u000aBut the splendour and glory of the Great Crusade and The Horus Heresy could only properly be represented by a sweeping symphonic power metal opera imo. Of course, some heavier sounds should definitely be in there though.
p692
aVSeriously, this needs to happen. Still hoping for Hansi to just go out and do it, [it's not as if he doesn't like SW.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKAdVbhtEY)  \u000a\u000aI need a Thrawn song so bad...

p701
aV[**Falconer - Wake Up**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U7g5RsWcF0) from *Grime vs. Grandeur*. It's already a very non-Falconer album, accentuated by the fact that this song is about rock and roll and stuff like that. It's not even got Mathias, which I guess describes a quarter of their albums, but I've listened to this song on shuffle and not even realized it was Falconer.\u000a\u000a[**HammerFall - 666 - The Enemy Within**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf1autcTMIQ) from *Infected*. HammerFall do not often sing about Satan. Okay, well actually everything is else is pretty much par for the course for HammerFall, but they're a pretty homogeneous band. Honorable mention for [My Sharona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-SFWc0dGfE), but it's a cover so I don't know if it should count.\u000a\u000a**[Kiuas - Of Love, Lust and Human Nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d19JIxgiZE)** from *Lustdriven*. Now, Kiuas' sound doesn't really vary much, but I think this song is least like the others. It has the whispery stuff at the beginning which sounds like it belongs in a Disturbed song, not a Kiuas one.\u000a\u000a**[Alestorm - Death Throes of the Terrorsquid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TKyNTwD3Yk)** from *Back Through Time*. A power metal song with growls and breakdowns? That's pretty unusual on its own. This song is pretty much lyrically congruent with everything else that Alestorm has done, but as far as the music goes, it's very different. Honorable mention for [Hangover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5P5Tz3VH94).
p702
aVMusically, I'd go with Trail of Broken Hearts by DragonForce. While they'd done power ballads before and since, this one comes off as trying too hard, with the excessively dramatic lyrics and the indulgent synthesizers, and it's easily my least favorite song of theirs, almost totally at odds with everything else they've done. Luckily, they cleaned up their act with the next one on Ultra Beatdown.\u000a\u000aLyrically, I'd go with Seasons, also by DragonForce. The music is on par with their usual stylings, the lyrics make it, fundamentally, a break-up song. It's also lyrically different in that the lyrics have a fairly clear (if metaphor-laden) meaning, but they've since done some stuff that's not just a Markov chain derived from a DnD manual.

aVI like both, especially Seasons. Dat bass drop doe

Song's ok, just seems like it was written in 5 minutes.\u000a\u000a\u000aNot sure if covers count but Iced Earth's cover of Highwayman. Outlaw country song by Iced Earth. 'nuff said. The only fitting part about it was Michael Paulson of Volbeat singing Johnny Cash's part, which was badass

(lp715
VI haven't listened to the album yet (Tuesday!!) but I know the general concept: On *Imaginations from the Other Side* we meet a boy who's kind of a loner and doesn't get along well with his family ('Bright Eyes'). One day he meets a stranger who introduces him to a magical mirror ('And the Story Ends'), though the mirror is truly a gateway to another world where the boy is destined to be king/the chosen one. However, the boy has sort of a doppelgänger in that world based on the worst parts of his personality. The boy has to make a choice: jump through the mirror or stay. He decides to stay, leading both worlds into chaos and disorder over the next twenty years while the gateways between the worlds all eventually close except the Red Mirror. The now grown up boy has to regain his memory and find a way to the other world, meanwhile his Modred-like counterpart is making efforts to improve his world.\u000a\u000aThe big influences behind it seem to be *The Chronicles of Narnia* and *Le Morte d'Arthur.*

Their music features a folkish 'natural' feel and themes such as the beauty of the natural world, existentialism, and storytelling.  The vocals within Viathyn's music are also more subdued than typical power metal vocal heights, which lends to the natural and existential themes of their albums.  The band's name is a play on the word '[leviathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan)', and has no true definition, but when describing the band can be defined as 'progressive, melodic, grandiose, innovative and emotional'. \u000a\u000a&gt;====\u000a\u000a&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/kWRPn1I.png) [^(i)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Viathyn_2014.png)\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a^Interesting: [^Noctis ^Valkyries ^Metal ^Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctis_Valkyries_Metal_Festival) ^| [^List ^of ^power ^metal ^bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_power_metal_bands) \u000a\u000a^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+coyph4j) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+coyph4j)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

aV"Golden Worm" by Winterage has my favorite guitar riff intro lately. It's so majestic it makes me think of the splendor of the infinite universe. \u000a\u000aAlso, check out Cellador, Galneryus, Rhapsody of Fire/Luca Turilli, Pathfinder, and DragonForce for splendid guitar work. Although you might find the latter two to be "wankery" as some put it, but as a guitarist myself, I love them. \u000a\u000aIf you're looking for metal outside Power Metal, I highly recommend these guitarists: Andy James, Dream Theater/John Petrucci, Jeff Loomis, Paul Wardingham, Sergey Golovin, and Theodore Ziras.
p729
aVGreat recommendations, everyone! Stormwarrior is always a blast, and yes, I've heard some of the more famous bands here, like DragonForce and Gamma Ray. That being said, it's always great to hear some songs that slipped under your radar. Heavenly is interesting, and I've been meaning to check out Dark Moor for awhile. So does anyone have any lesser known songs or budding artists? I think Viathyn is taking the crown in that category right now. Broke my heart to see they had NO ratings on either album on Amazon MP3!

aV(Someone already recommended [Cellador](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG79dvSCaFk), otherwise I would have said them).\u000a\u000aOther than Viathyn, for Canadian bands we have [Borealis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n49T3GFqbqA) which is very riff heavy but doesn't have as much guitar soloing (and also prog/power), for something really weird but interesting (they have some very interesting concept album work), there's [Antiquus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xNfVesyG3w), for something with a big focus on lyrics but also great guitar work, there's [Instanzia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flupVYEIb3Q), a Firewind-esque band [King Misfit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2snxallivNA), a very heavy epic/black/power metal mix headed by a 18-19 year old, [Primalfrost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99dsIMoVqng), a subdued, shoegazy folkish act from one guy [Sequester](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hifAkro4LLM), and a heavier band with distorted vocals but a clear PM influence [Shadowblade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcXh9Jc6fQ).\u000a\u000aFor other countries, other people are probably better for recommendations. But I think in that list you'll find something.

p862
aVExcellent, welcome back even though you sort of never left. Also, i agree with everything you said, the overreaction, the drama and the no need for rules.
p863
aVI just have a small suggestion. When the release thread gets posted on Saturday, don't sticky it until Sunday or Monday. The timeframes they cover go from Monday to Sunday, so there might still be releases coming out from the previous week's thread. Furthermore, I feel like no one looks at the release thread once it's stickied. That might sound weird, but look at this week's thread and its score of 3, and compare it back to when I or MMC would do the threads and they'd be unstickied on the frontpage for about 24 hours before they got stickied. \u000a\u000aThoughts?
p864
aVYeah I've been playing around with the timings on that one. From your experience of running it, did you find that anybody interacted with it from about Tuesday onwards? I'm thinking it may be worth freeing up the sticky slot for other activities if it steams ahead with its own momentum. 
p865
aVNot many new comments would come in past Tuesday, but I saw a few replies to other comments. By Thursday, it was pretty much dead. But I've used it countless times later on in the week to see what albums were coming out on that certain day. \u000a\u000aAside from the end of year awards, is there anything else you'd sticky instead?
p866
aVWe've had ideas in the community in the past. Depends what comes up.
p867
aVI love this thread title. 
p868
aVA moderator that doesn't freak out at the smallest cheeky provocation is a good moderator, wink wink.\u000a\u000aWhen I came here, I was impressed by the community and how level-headed everybody was. Obviously, this week showed me otherwise, but I'm glad you still believe in it, there are good and sensible people here.
p869
aVNothing to apologise for Warrior in Chief. Agreed fully that heavy-handed modding (as always) isn't the right solution and the community is best left to self-policing with occasional step-ins only when necessary. It's good to hear you'll be keeping a closer eye on things.\u000a\u000aThat said - totally aside from the silly week - it springs to mind that there was a highly commented upon thread with a number of users voicing support for a 2nd mod but you're still - even in this very thread - reluctant to consider that. Similarly a guidelines thread was gaining attention as well as detailed suggestions too...will they be disregarded additionally? I know the Grand Wizard hat must be awfully comfy but a true Supreme Sorcerer knows when to *listen* to the community too. Subs run best as democracies. Still, maybe it's best to see how things go into the next year.
p870
aVSee my response elsewhere in this thread with regards to a second mod. 
p871
aVI think as long as he's up to it he's more than capable of handling this sub on his own. Personally I do the majority of modding on a subreddit of similar size AND one that's over twice the size. It's not a huge task to check the mod queue and mod mail every now and then, especially with tools like /r/Toolbox.
p872
aVIt is often smarter to listen to the wise than to demand more government.
p873
aVGood.
p874
aVFirst off, it is good to know that you will be able to oversee what goes in here more frequently.\u000a\u000aSecond, it now seems odd that we were allowed to suggest guidelines and now that's considered a bad move? Most rules that got mentioned were common sense from users that wanted a small semblance of order in this subreddit. I don't see it as a bad thing but I may be wrong.
p875
aVlaissez faire works just fine here.  
p876
aVThanks for being in touch, it's good to have a reasonable moderator for the sub.\u000a\u000aI agree with your decision. At first I though we needed moderation, but I thought about it and I think that part of the thing that makes this sub special is that we don't have rules and still get along and have good quality submissions.\u000a\u000aPresumably as the sub grows past 10k or more subs rules might have to happen, but for now I think level-headed moderation on a case-by-case basis is the way to go.\u000a\u000astay awesome.
p877
aVI think it's best to keep it loose at the moment. The lame theme threads (I contributed to one set heavily) might have caused an upswing in overall posts. \u000a\u000aThe only thing I can think of is maybe a "curfew" on certain bands or songs for 2-4 months. For example, Daft Punk released Get Lucky, and /r/music exploded with Get Lucky posts. However, now that the hoopla died down, there might not be as much of a reason to force Daft Punk into its own sub
p878
aVI feel my post in the moderation thread hits the nail on the head. It talks about freedom from rules, with only a few simple guidelines for organization and to avoid the recent situation that, whether or not annoyed you, annoyed a lot of people.\u000a\u000aBut if you're back to use logical judgment and devote attention then things might be okay. We are getting to a point where a second moderator might not be a bad idea, though.
p879
aV&gt; We are getting to a point where a second moderator might not be a bad idea, though.\u000a\u000aWe're actually surprisingly still quite a long way away from that point.\u000a\u000a---------------\u000a\u000aCurrent age of the items in my reports queue:\u000a\u000a2 days ago\u000a\u000a4 days ago\u000a\u000a8 days ago\u000a\u000a8 days ago\u000a\u000a8 days ago\u000a\u000a15 days ago\u000a\u000a---------\u000a\u000aCurrent age of items in my  mod messages:\u000a\u000a2 days ago\u000a\u000a29 days ago\u000a\u000a1 month ago\u000a\u000a1 month ago\u000a\u000a3 months ago\u000a\u000a4 months ago
p880
aVI'm not sure if I would agree that is a good measurement for there being a second moderator.  It's a small community without rules put in place and without assurance that reporting even does anything.  Reporting seems like a null point.  However, if you're going to be able to devote attention, a second moderator is probably not necessary.
p881
aVIt wasn't that I wasn't willing to devote attention, but rather that /r/Futurology was flooding the shit out of all my mod channels so I just wasn't picking up on any communication coming my way. 
p882
aVWell, because of that it was hard to devote attention, I mean.  I understand what you are saying; no worries.
p883
aVThank you for the response I had hoped for from the moderator of this sub. And thank you for making it known that it is up to us to decide how this sub will proceed with content.
p884
aVrespect.
p885
aVCool. Thinking about it, your policy of "no rules, common sense" is great. And while there may have been a little bit of recent turmoil, shit seems to have calmed down now. 
p886
asVAlright, let's hash it out. ZP or Marc?
p887
(lp888
VBoth. I like classic Dragonforce as well as new Dragonforce. Both will always hold a special place in my heart.
p889
aVThis. 
p890
aVThat's what up votes are for.
p891
aVCame here to say that. Have an upvote!
p892
aVThis is a really great question, but the answer has to be ZP. The Valley of the Damned is my all-time favourite power metal album. It's a masterpiece, and he is a huge reason why. His performance never waned, even despite the one bad album in their catalogue (Ultra Beatdown).\u000a\u000aWith that said, it's hard to deny how great the work with Marc is. The first album with a new singer was opened with a wailing scream that immediately sold me on Marc. He's not as good of a singer, but both albums with him are near perfect. I think I like both better than Sonic Firestorm (my second favourite of the ZP era). 
p893
aVMaybe I'm a blasphemer or whatever, but DragonForce got me into power metal in the first place(the genre I listen to almost exclusively now.) So yeah, thanks ZP.\u000a\u000aThat being said, if DragonForce wanted to go into a new direction, they couldn't have found a better match than Marc. I saw them live when they came to L.A. before Power Within was released, and I was sold.\u000a\u000aAt this point, classic DF and new DF fill different niches for me. I love the awesome nonsense lyrics and bombastic feel of classic DF, but I feel new DF meets a higher standard of quality(personal tastes aside.) \u000a\u000aBasically, ZP and Marc are both great at different things, and I'm too much of a fan/weenie to choose.
p894
aVThis is really tough. And just so we don't have any debate later - Marc Hudson *does* have a "wider" vocal range than ZP Theart (A2-B5ish v. Bb2-G5ish). But I hate using "wide vocal range" as the reason why someone is a better singer. \u000a\u000aI'm siding with ZP on this one. Mostly because I like the tone of his voice significantly more.\u000a\u000aI'm not a Dragonforce fan, so this is probably not as well-researched as some of yours, but I have seen both of them and, live, Marc is absolutely phenomenal. Like, they were mindblowingly good with Marc.\u000a\u000aHowever, ZP has sung some of my favorite Dragonforce songs - some of the best (as in "most complex") vocal work Dragonforce has done has been stuff like *Above The Winter Moonlight*, *Black Winter Night*, *Starfire*, etc. He does some stuff with his voice that is just ridiculously impressive.\u000a\u000aThat said, I haven't really given Marc a chance on the recorded stuff. I haven't listened to anything after *Sonic Firestorm*, to be honest, and what I have heard I wasn't that impressed with. But I don't know if that's because the music hasn't evolved or whatnot.\u000a\u000aBut I can't overstate that - as a live performer - Marc is probably like top 10 vocalist I've ever seen.
p895
aV&gt;[...as a live performer - Marc is probably like top 10 vocalist I've ever seen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kZGNLIjSLI#t=277)\u000a\u000aI agreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
p896
aVThis is so tough. I think I'm one of the few who looks forward to lineup changes within a band to see how one change can affect the whole project, even if it is for the worse in the end. When ZP was finished I couldn't wait to hear new Dragonforce material. Now that they've got two albums with him under their belt (and I have yet to see him live) it's still tough for me to say. \u000a\u000aSimilar to what /u/70000TonsOfMetal said above me, I feel like Dragonforce has more noteworthy songs with ZP than with Marc (which obviously isn't the greatest analysis due to only having two albums with the guy.) On the other hand I have a much easier time listening to The Power Within and Maximum Overload from start to finish than I do Inhuman Rampage and Ultra Beatdown.\u000a\u000aI guess you could say that, in my opinion, they've picked up the slack since their last two albums with ZP? Two albums is enough to say he was a suitable replacement (hell, one is probably enough) but I'm not entirely set on who I prefer just yet.
p897
aVAfter I heard Marc once, I knew I liked him more than ZP. I think that they're both good and fit well with Dragonforce, but I personally like Marc more.
p898
aV[deleted]
p899
aVI agree with parks completely for songs and vocal abilities. Only thing is ZP was much more genuine and passionate about crowd involvement. He owned the stage and the crowd was his.\u000a\u000aMarc is good, but during solos he'll move behind Sam and Herman and Fred and won't involve himself with getting the crowd hyped, it almost feels awkward and uncomfortable.\u000a
p900
aVI think I will always be partial to ZP myself. It's just that I've been a Dragonforce fan since the beginning, and to hear somebody other than ZP saying is quite different.\u000a\u000aNothing against Marc its just I prefer the ZP material over Marc material. It's not that the Marc stuff is bad it's just that the ZP stuff is just that much better.\u000a\u000aSo with that I would rather hear Valley of the Damned or Sonic Firestorm over The Power Within or Maximum Overdrive if given the choice.
p901
aV&gt;Maximum Overload
p902
aVThank you for the fact check. I always mess that album name up.
p903
aVMarc by far. ZP couldn't perform old songs to save his life by the end of his run, and I got the feeling he stopped giving a shit after the Inhuman Rampage hype faded. Marc seems driven and focused, which is a lot more than I could say for ZP. \u000a\u000a*Twilight Dementia* is a good example of how bad ZP's vocals had gotten. On the other hand, Marc is pretty much flawless live, especially when he's singing his own material. And on the albums, ZP kind of just *let it all out there*, if you guys know what I mean. There was no subtlety and restraint on his part. He more or less resorted to talking his way through some songs on *Ultra Beatdown*. Marc's voice is a little generic, but I'd rather have generic than "past his prime".
p904
aVOoh, arguing about DragonForce, my specialty. \u000a\u000aHm...well, I would have to say that bringing a new voice, and by extension a new dynamic, forced them to evolve their sound somewhat and adapt to somebody with a wider range, was ultimately a good thing for the band. ZP was good, but his range was limited and I feel prevented them from exploring some possibilities that Marc is allowing them to look into now. Plus, ZP couldn't sing live, like, at all, whereas Marc is decent, at least. I'd have to go with Marc, because he simply did help the band grow.
p905
aVI'd say definitely Marc, although I don't dislike ZP's work with DragonForce. Maybe he's gotten better recently too, because he sounds great with [Pentakill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be1waE9myCU)
p906
aVI like both iterations of Dragonforce, with ZP and Marc Hudson. Right now, I'll go with ZP. However, Marc Hudson is growing on me, plus the band is figuring out how to perform with his voice. \u000a\u000aGiven 1-2 more albums, I feel that I'll probably end up liking Marc Hudson more. Dragonforce has been shifting to a new sound, but keeping enough of the old sound around. While it sounds slower, the BPM actually sounds like it has gotten faster. 
p907
aVZP gets my vote. Valley of the Damned is the greatest album they have relased, and ZP's range is higher and just plain superior sounding than Hudson's I feel.\u000a\u000aI do enjoy Hudson, don't get me wrong. And he has been getting better, his vocals on the Maximum Overload album was much better than The Power Within in my opinion.
p908
aVI gotta go with Marc. While I felt this year's album was lackluster, I thought The Power Within is one of the DF's strongest albums. Everything meshed well on that album, and Marc did a fantastic job.
p909
aVi liked how marc sounded on the first album better than zp.  his voice just sounded more...full and clear to me.  but their new album...damn, he blew me away.  three hammers especially, i play that song damn near every day on my way to the gym.
p910
aVIn going to have to say ZP. I love Marc, but Dragonforces older stuff is what got me into power metal just because of the talent from ZP. Before Dragonforce, I didn't know this kind of music existed...now I'm hooked!!!

I think PM is a very good genre for getting people into metal due to the positivity and general lighter heaviness levels.\u000a\u000aGenerally people want positivity from their music (Positive music to reinforce positive moods, and positive music to escape negative moods).

p1077
aVAlways good to see another Neonfly enthusiast. I probably listen to Heart of the Sun 5x a day nowadays... its *that good*
p1078
aVI wasn't expecting to find Neonfly here! I first saw them years ago back when they had their previous singer. They played the Bloodstock festival not long after that, but the singer couldn't make it so they brought in Norton as a temporary replacement. He was *so* much better that we all begged them to keep him on permanently. Fortunately, they did.\u000a\u000a&gt; I couldn't find an isolated track that is a must-listen.\u000a\u000aThat track is "Ship with no sails", but only really in a live setting. Like the rest of the debut album, if felt a bit flat in the studio.\u000a\u000aThe second album is much, *much* better.
p1079
aVHah, so sad for the original singer! But I'm glad for it, Norton is amazing.\u000a\u000aShip with no Sails is definitely good, though. But so is basically the whole album... couldn't pick one that stood out high above the others.\u000a\u000aIn terms of production value, the second album is better indeed. I'd probably lean towards that one as well, but the first one is awesome as well.
p1080
aV&gt; Hah, so sad for the original singer! But I'm glad for it, Norton is amazing.\u000a\u000aYes. Vocally the previous singer, Tamás Csemez, [was actually quite reasonable](https://soundcloud.com/tamas-csemez/the-sign-of-the-southern-cross), although he lacked stage presence. It's just that Norton is better on pretty much every level.
p1081
aVMy good friend Andy Midgely (ex-Power Quest, has played with I AM I) just became their official guitarist. Great band, amazing energy on-stage, seriously has great potential. 
p1082
aVI always shrugged at Neonfly, Heart of the sun is a good song though.\u000a\u000aJust a note: Highways to Nowhere isn't really a punk rock song, it goes more into alternative metal territory ala Disturbed mixed with Neonfly's power metal style.
p1083
aVI don't know if you're into hard rock, but if not, I can definitely understand the lack of appeal.\u000a\u000aAs for Highways to Nowhere, I found it a little hard to place. Thanks for pointing that out 
p1084
aVQuite frankly I always felt hard rock to be a bit too samey, i definitely like some of it but most of hard rock songs are just either to similar to others or too simplistic. [Audrey Horne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YYCjR2dgsc), is an example of what I would call a good hard rock band and song.\u000a\u000aNeonfly is definitely a good band but ultimately I just get that familiar sensation or repetition, even if they're 100% original songs. They do have good melodies though.

p1133
aVSame. I see no reason either, but if it does actually sound different I can at least give it a listen.
p1134
aVI'll disagree. I'm rarely in favour of bands releasing rerecorded or remixed albums. But in this case, the original version was weak, and could maybe benefit from some additional tweaking to get it to the same level as some of their other releases.
p1135
aVWhy? Easily their weakest IMO. Hopefully the corrections Sielck plans to make will make it a bit better.

p1148
aVI agree about At the Edge of Time. Definitely the best song on the album
p1149
aVBeyond The Red Mirror is fantastic. Their best since Night At The Opera(which is my favorite BG album), and in top 5 overall. 
p1150
aVI would put it at 3rd behind Nightfall and At the Edge of Time, but they're pretty much all great albums.\u000a
p1151
aVMan. The chorus of this song bugs me so much. I feel like it's only half a musical phrase. Like, it builds tension, and then doesn't resolve (stays on the 4th degree). To me, there should be another 4 bars after it to "complete" the phrase.

aVMy favorites from each album (in no particular order):\u000a\u000a1. [Mindtraveller - Falconer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yMsxQWuWvE)\u000a\u000a2.

[Spirit of the Hawk - Northwind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEw7aP-HhBQ) (This whole album is great)\u000a\u000a6.

[At the Jester's Ball - Black Moon Rising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HX7rG_M2aE)
p1159
aVFalconer is the best band ever. *Spirit of the Hawk* is their worst song.\u000a\u000aI like that we can agree on how great the band is, but have vastly differing views on what tracks are the best. That's the sign of a good band. I think. . .
p1160
aVIn my opinion, *Power* is their worst song. Either way, Falconer is great.
p1161
aVI'm sorry, have you heard *The Gate*? That one's just bad, even Stefan agrees its their worst.\u000a\u000a*Spirit of the Hawk* isn't what I would choose from Northwind, (*Perjury and Sanctity* all the way, man), but it's far from their worst. :(

aVIt's a good single song. This, along with "World on Fire" and "Mercenary Man" and "Breaking the Silence" were pretty much the first ever power metal songs I listened to that weren't recorded by Sonata Arctica. Sonata Arctica was my gateway to power metal, and Firewind were the second power metal band I ever listened to.

VI'm not sure if you're being sarcastic, but the Lord's Prayer is a cornerstone prayer of Christianity.

VWe're winding down! So it turns out I end up listening to all of these albums in full anyway sometime during the week. So I guess these opinions of mine are mainly for others to enjoy...\u000a\u000aMy opinions (based upon previews only):\u000a\u000a* **Fortress Under Siege:** *ft. Hannibal*...ok..Anyways, instantly that guy's voice reminds me a lot of modern-day Bruce Dickinson. Not so much as [Attick Demons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg-RzE-a6qs), but you get the point. It seems a bit generic and it's recalling a lot of the Project Arcadia album from earlier this year, but it's solid all-around. There's no real complaints; it's vocally-driven with the rest of the instrumentation seemingly an afterthought, but it works decently well. It's nothing ground-breaking or monumental, but it gets the job done. Just like last time, I'll check out a second track on these iffy previews. "[Hate What We Like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLznAN86qyE)" is much more powerful as a preview for the album. I'm really digging those synths in the verses, and the singer's voice is much more powerful than in the previous song. I'd definitely recommend giving this second track a listen. \u000a\u000a* **ShadowIcon:** ...whereas this singer reminds me of Kiara Laetita from Skylark *shudder*. Although I will say it's refreshing to see such high productions from Slovenia. Also, what is a Chloe Grace-Moretz lookalike doing in this video? Anyways, the singer's definitely the weakest point of this song, but it's bearable. The symphonic passages and the synths are what caught my attention the most upon first listen, so hopefully that singer can grow on me. Her lows seem to resonate the most with me, but its her highs on the chorus that just trouble me a little bit. No second song preview for this one.\u000a\u000a* **\u0422\u0440\u0438\u0443\u043c\u0444\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u042a (Triumphator):** Have I ever mentioned that I can't listen to Slavic languages? I know I said I was pretty un-picky when it came to vocals, but just the enunciation of it doesn't sit right with me, much like Japanese doesn't bode well with many people here. The slightly-lacking production aside, it's just not anything special. Very derivative and dime-a-dozen. Fazermint put it well: it's monotone and repetitive. No second song here either, and I'm not sure I'd want one.\u000a\u000a* **Zaria:** Slovenian vocals. Great. Same issue as the last one. The vocals just irk me a bit, and the rest of the song is a little bland, but now there's folky stuff going on too, so I guess that's the difference. The song kind of just plods along uninterestingly, and I frankly couldn't care any less about it once we're 4 minutes into it. Get your shit together, Eastern Europe!\u000a\u000aWhat I missed last week:\u000a\u000a* **Light Bringer:** I was really hoping this one would have a preview link. I've waited too damn long this year to get a single good power metal live DVD, and this seems to be my best shot. Light Bringer is great, so hopefully this DVD ends up online at some point.\u000a\u000a* **Voodoma:** The vocalists on this one are way more competent than the last couple albums. The female clean vocals and the male cleans are used pretty well together, and it's promising, but that's it. I just hope it's not like a lot of other generic Germany heavy metal bands. The female vocals on this one definitely set it apart, but considering they're just guest vocals, I'm still not entirely sold. YouTube just uploaded [the whole album here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh68lJlxjZmDl3CnS0XoecA/videos), so I decided to check out track #2, "[Secret Circle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRpP7GD9H9c)". And it's more of the same. If anything, I'm excited about the progressive tinges and the possibility of something more than just "GERMAN HEAVY METAL", but I wouldn't say either of the songs have been memorable. \u000a\u000aSo, in conclusion, maybe check out the first two albums, and watch the Light Bringer DVD if you find it somewhere online in the future. I gotta get to work on Top 30 list of 2014 (my top two albums aren't even power metal this year, and that's terrifying to me). Comments are welcome, unless you're /u/realkman666, in which case they're demanded.

aVThe troll has been summoned, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to troll about? I'm a big Versailles fan, but I don't know Light Bringer too much.
p1288
aV*Scenes of Infinity* and *Genesis* are Light Bringer at their best, if you need a starting point to listen to them. Try listening to "[noah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc8tHKdNieY)" for a good idea of what they sound like.\u000a\u000a**Edit:** I just saw your other comment here. If you liked "noah", you should like Light Bringer.
p1289
aVThey're fantastic, but the prices are outrageous.\u000a\u000aFun fact, first result on Amazon.ca is Bringers of Light, by Damnation Angels.
p1290
aVYou're just toying with me now. Besides, that's a great album.\u000a\u000aYeah, importing anything from Japan is outrageously expensive. It's the one place I don't feel guilty pirating music from (even though I eventually end up buying most of it because I'm weak-willed).

aVThe universe wants you to love him.\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/93tdX7J.jpg

aVI never said I didn't love him. I love that Damnation Angels album, and I love *Ocean of Opportunity* to an extent. If anything, I've given him a fair chance, more than I can say about most people. His newest album is horrendous, though, and his covers seem kind of careless nowadays. I just don't like when people post his videos every day. It would be the same if people posted Blind Guardian every day.

aVYay, it's that time of the week again! Appropriate gif is appropriate (I had a part in the drama with my inappropriate PelleK comment last week. I've taken the criticisms to heart, no more vulgar comments from me!)\u000a\u000a* **Fortress Under Siege**: This is decent. It's got some wonderfully quirky moments that jumps out above the otherwise generic sound of this preview. The vocalist is pretty damn good, actually.  \u000a* **ShadowIcon**: A very vocal-focused song (or band, idk). The female vocalist is all right, a little more on the pop side of the spectrum. Sadly, the musical part is pretty lackluster, and serve as background for the voice. There's a short keyboard/guitar solo, but to me it sounds like they're just going through the motions, having a solo just because that's the standard song format. This is not bad by any means, but it's pretty weak in terms of both symphonic metal and power metal.  \u000a* **Triumphator**: All right guys. This is an EP. Apparently not a debut EP - I checked Metal Archives and the band debuted with a full release earlier this year. Onto the preview. I don't think there's really any other way to say it: It's just bad. It has the low production quality of a debut EP in the early 2000's. The preview song is, in a word, monotone. Repetitive drums / riffs and un-melodic vocals. It's just not doing it for me.  \u000a* **Zaria**: This is a style I don't personally like, and I won't deride it for being what it is. What you get: Folk metal that is, correct me if I'm wrong, a little bleak musically. There's both a male and female voice. The male voice switches between three vocal styles (weird nasal-sounding vocals, regular vocals, and growling), and the female voice is in soprano style. It has some decent moments, I guess. I'm not big enough on folk metal to really say if it's good or bad.  \u000a* **Light Bringer**: No preview. DVD release, anyway.\u000a* **Voodoma**: If I am to describe this with one word, the word of choice would probably be *weird*. The frontman kinda looks like your average joe neighbor. Anyway, he sings all right. From what I gather, there's a female guest vocalist, who also sings all right. The song is rather slow and monotone, kind of *weird*. The interaction between the two vocalists in the video only contribute more *weird*. Watch it for the fun, if anything.\u000a\u000aYesyes, slow week for power metal. I can't really recommend anything.

aVThanks for the fixes! Great work, as usual. Updated my post accordingly.
p1297
aVGreat, Tony Kakko revisits a classic to fix his lyrics and ShadowIcon mess it up in the damn title. Zaria is pretty cool. With a bit more energy, I'd be behind this all the way. \u000a\u000aBad week for guitar tones overall.\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is not from the new DVD, but I guess it's similar to what you can expect from Light Bringer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk01RyB7kNA\u000a\u000aIt's a bit tempting even at 50 buckaroos. I paid more for End of an Era back in the day. http://www.yesasia.com/us/the-light-brings-the-past-scenes-%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E7%89%88/1036985952-0-0-0-zh_TW/info.html

aVI do roughly the same thing, but usually with Elvenkind. I suspect my roommate secretly hates me for it, but he has yet to say anything. 
p1335
aVI was in a band in middle school that played Tool covers. I was the singer. This was ~1999/2000ish. I thought I knew how to sing.\u000a\u000aEnter power metal (I discovered it in 2001). That's really what turned me on to the great singers of the world. That said, I always thought those type of vocals was something I couldn't do, so I gravitated more towards growly-melodic-death metal stuff (even though I was never really into that type of music) and was in more bands covering that type of music (In Flames, Arch Enemy, Dark Tranquillity, etc.).\u000a\u000aA few years back, I had some vocal chord problems and now I can't growl *at all*. Like, literally can't scream or growl no matter how much I try. So I focused on developing my clean voice more and, at the urging of an ex-girlfriend who was a *phenomenal* singer, started teaching myself to sing power metal. Lots of DVDs, met with her vocal teacher, etc. I realized that singing really is something anyone can do with enough practice. I also really need to put some covers up (once I move out of this apartment. . .I need some actual recording space).\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, I've been playing drums for ~18 years and I think power metal probably dumbed down my drumming =P. I first started studying jazz and stuff and now I just want to double-bass and play Sonata Arctica beats all day. \u000a\u000aBeen playing guitar for ~12 years. Power metal definitely helped there. Completely self-taught.\u000a\u000aBought a keyboard on a whim ~3 years ago just to dick around. Nearly everything I know is power metal (Twilightning, Cain's Offering, Sonata Arctica, etc.).\u000a\u000aThis seems like the type of genre where most people are musicians. I'd be amazed if the majority of /r/powermetal didn't play at least one instrument and/or sang.
p1336
aV&gt; On the other hand, I've been playing drums for ~18 years and I think power metal probably dumbed down my drumming =P. I first started studying jazz and stuff and now I just want to double-bass and play Sonata Arctica beats all day.\u000a\u000aI can relate. Been playing drums for about six years (you already know I'm pretty young), and nowadays I'd rather play a Sonata Arctica or Sabaton track than play something more complex like Seventh Wonder or Symphony X (although one of my favorite accomplishments is learning "The Odyssey" over the summer).
p1337
aV&gt; one of my favorite accomplishments is learning "The Odyssey" over the summer\u000a\u000aI binge-listened to it for a week to learn all the lyrics as quick as I could - nothing is better than a 24-minute car ride and a sore throat afterward.  Totally worth it, every time.

aVGuitarist/drummer/piano player here\u000a\u000ahaving played many instruments is one of the reasons I shied away from more mainstream genres, their focus is completely away from instrumental depth.

p1340
aVI just remind myself that my favorite vocalist, Mathias Blad, didn't record anything with Falconer until he was 28.\u000a\u000aJo Amore from Nightmare didn't really start singing (professionally) until he was in his 40s.\u000a\u000aThere's always time :-)
p1341
aVYeah, definitely started singing because of power metal.  Been told I am good by people as well.  Probably will upload covers here in the future once I can get my hand on a decent mic.
p1342
aVYea, i also started to sing, but the truth is that i can't. I also bought myself a keyboard but it turned out that i can't do that too. Sad, isn't it?
p1343
aVWell keep trying man! Don't give up yet. People spend years learning and practicing and it's a talent you'll have for the rest of your life!

aVI can't sing for my life, let alone epic power metal. I do play and study guitar religiously though and shred daily. I aspire to write epic power metal, but there's too many obstacles like writing for the other instruments...
p1351
aVI can say that people are surprised at the stuff I can belt out in karaoke if they have power metal songs.\u000a\u000aWhen I went to japan for a while...karaoke like every week with people so I could sing the huge PM selection. They would never have that amount of stuff anywhere over here.\u000a\u000aSA's Fullmoon was my go-to karaoke thing :P
p1352
aVSomewhat. I started because of Rocksmith and singing along to [Nirvana's In Bloom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbgKEjNBHqM). "Whoa! I can sing the high notes! I better see a vocal coach". I just started listening to power metal, and loved it, so I tried that genre\u000a\u000aThings I found:\u000a\u000a1. Power metal is high. [I tried to sing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZJw19uFQ18) but had lots of trouble\u000a2. It's best to be a tenor. Some signs is if your voice has a naturally light timber. If you have a deep voice and can't speak loudly, you might not speak in your voice's best pitch. \u000a3. Baritones are common in rock, but not in power metal. It's dominated by tenors, tenor being the highest range for males. This may explain why there's a lot of women in power metal, but not other kinds of metal\u000a4. Nirvana is baritone, so when my voice got stronger, In Bloom ended up not being high at all\u000a5. Because of how high power metal is, I had to start out with alternative rock\u000a6. Not only power metal has a lot of tenors, a lot of songs go above the normal tenor range.\u000a7. A lot of power metal vocalists have training in the classic music style. It's actually a good idea to find someone skilled in opera or the classic music style if you are going to take lessons. [You'll find quite a few power metal singers you never expect to be able to sing well in those settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9neDIowyhaA)\u000a8. I can sing Promised Land now\u000a9. Van Canto is a good band to start out with\u000a\u000aSome bands like Sabaton have baritones.

asVBorealis launches Kickstarter for new album/tour
p1360
(lp1361
VAs much as I love the band's music, this doesn't look like a great kickstarter. The goal itself is rather vague. It seems to be for a tour, but the project is 'album/tour?' Is there anything connected to the album about this, aside from the tour following the album's release? And what is the tour? A few cities in Canada? An extensive North America tour? European festivals?\u000a\u000aThe rewards are iffy too. The band will do 'anything' for $200? For an amount 100x that, I could see that be an award tier, but that's way to vague for an amount that's simultaneously quite large and low. The $35 award tier is good for that rare category of people who a) wants to support the band in this way and b)doesn't own their music yet. Most importantly, it's missing out on the perfect backer-award, which would be a copy of their new album, optionally signed at a slight premium cost.\u000a\u000aI wish these guys success in their effort, I just also wish that this kickstarter looked more appealing.
p1362
aVI fully agree with you. I'm actually against crowdfunding in general, but Borealis is one of two bands (the other being Crimson Shadows) that I will support through crowdfunding.\u000a\u000aIf I were to guess, I would imagine they'd go for a North American tour rather than a European one. I think they are decently connected in the power metal world, and it would not be a huge stretch for them to get on a tour, but I would not contribute with the expectation of them hitting a particular city. It's actually kinda strange because based on the updates we've received, I was under the impression the album is pretty much done, so the only costs left would be pressing. \u000a\u000aI too am surprised at the lack of perks related to the new album, but maybe they aren't sure when it would be done yet. The only saving grace I see related to this Kickstarter is that it's only funded if they meet their goal. \u000a\u000aMuch in the way people will buy 10 different editions of the new Blind Guardian, I'd pretty much do the equivalent for Borealis here. I really love their music.
p1363
aVI'll bug them to put the new album as a reward.\u000a\u000aEDIT: They said it's sort of difficult since their label wouldn't really be keen on that. I'll see if they can treat it like a pre-order or something.

(lp1369
VGood writeup. I know that r/powermetal has a bit of a thing for Hansi, but I don't think it was fair that he was even considered for a vocalist award just for singing on two songs in 2014.\u000a\u000aOther than that, glad Viathyn won something. 
p1370
aVHe was on a couple ~~albums~~ songs on Iced Earth's album as well. Regardless, the way I see it is that anyone who performed as a power metal vocalist in 2014 was eligible. If someone sang one live show in 2014, I'd consider that to be enough to qualify. If that performance was great enough to beat out the competition, I don't see why they shouldn't win.
p1371
aVOh, how fitting that self-post icon is!\u000a\u000aOk, now I can take off my MC hat and give my personal take! It was a pretty good year for my picks. Hansi crushed the competition in his categories, and Blind Guardian took the awards they were nominated for, even if they had to share them! Sabaton winning with Heroes was not unexpected, but it remains my opinion that while having several nice, catchy songs, it's at best a mediocre album. Meanwhile, I'd probably put Falconer's Black Moon Rising in my top ten, at least my top fifteen, of all-time power metal albums. It just blows Heroes out of the competition for me.  At least as much of a disappointment for me, if only due to my expectation of Heroes' victory, was Triosphere's loss for best female-fronted release. [The Heart of the Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0) is pure top notch quality power metal, and easily one of the best releases for the subgenre in recent years. I wish it received the recognition in this list that it deserved.\u000a\u000a[P.S. Someone has to gargle thumbtacks!](http://i.imgur.com/Kr8MFSh.jpg)
p1372
aV[Oh my god...°_° alright fetch the thumbtacks](http://i.imgur.com/e1L4R7Y.gif)
p1373
aVIt would be great if you could also give the links to the previous years awards in your thread post. 
p1374
aVI'm just surprised BG didn't win EVERYTHING, including the best female-fronted release.\u000a\u000aWhen a couple of guest appearances results in vocalist of the year, you know something's wrong.\u000a\u000aRanting aside, YAY SABATON. And how did Triosphere not win the female-fronted award?
p1375
aVI'm not sure why you two are taking issue with this... He not only had the guest appearances, but also had the single Twilight of the Gods released. Furthermore, I see 'best vocalist' as a 'performance' category. That is, any studio or live performance is enough to qualify if given a nomination. The winner, ideally, is the one who gave the best live or studio performance with their vocals. That's opposed to those categories based more on songwriting: best album, best song, best solo, best instrumentation, etc. The vocal equivalent of that might be 'best vocal melody' or 'best chorus' where *what* the vocalist is singing is more important that specific performance of it, to the extent that those can be separated. Of course, it's my view that Hansi would qualify for those as well, if we had such categories, given the release of Twilight of the Gods in 2014.
p1376
aVI understand. I was of the mindset that the focus was on studio releases only. I'm not saying Hansi is not eligible for the category, but I'm sure there are other vocalists who have a greater claim to that title.\u000a\u000aIn the end, though, that's only my opinion. I certainly don't want to make a big deal out of this... I just can't help but feel that /r/PowerMetal's bias towards BG skewed the votes significantly. That said, "Twilight of the Gods" is a magnificent track well-deserving of the title of song of the year. 
p1377
aV/r/PowerMetal has a bias towards several bands. It's the nature of contests like these that they show those biases. 
p1378
aVI realize that. I have several biases myself, as well :p\u000a\u000aDon't mind me, though. Excellent work in putting this together, by the way! Enjoyable read
p1379
aVWell, Beyond The Red Mirror came out in 2015, so Twilight of The Gods is the only track that can qualify for 2014.
p1380
aVWhoops. Not a single person/album/song I voted for won. I guess I'm doing something wrong.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Except Noble Beast. That album is perfect.
p1381
aVChris Bowes wins best non-guitar instrumentation two years in row.  Think about that for a second.  That means people listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BWvkBOqrz8) and think "Man, this is as good as it gets!"\u000a\u000aWhat the hell kind of Twilight Zone am I living in?
p1382
aVThanks dude! I put my heart and soul into wooden leg.\u000a\u000aThough on a serious note, we appreciate this. We are finding ourselves in a world where we are pretty much the only power (kindof) metal band that plays fully live - everyone else is sticking their keyboards and orchestras and acoustic guitars and backing vocals on a tape for live shows. So the fact y'all like what we do is heartwarming :)
p1383
aVif only that was one of the better songs on the album. listen to sunset on the golden age or the battle of cartagena and its obvious why they won
p1384
aVlol. no. 
p1385
aVWhat an argument.
p1386
aVAdamantra should've won it.
p1387
aVwow that was a pretty shitty song
p1388
aVwait until you hear their taio cruz cover 
p1389
aVBest song on the album imho
p1390
aVI'm really surprised Ancient Bards won best female fronted release, considering how much love Triosphere gets on this sub, but I voted for it so it was a pleasant surprise. Also Sabaton had no business winning best album IMO but whatever, seems like they're the kind of band that'll get an award from this sub every year they release an album 
p1391
aV&gt; Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods\u000a\u000aHey, what the fu-\u000a\u000a\u005c*listens\u005c*\u000a\u000aOh, it's an original.
p1392
aVI'm a bit disappointed that DragonForce didn't get anything, but I'm quite into Sabaton, and they fucking cleaned up here, so...I guess I'll take it! Congratulations to Sabaton, and Joakim!
p1393
aV2014 was the strongest year in power metal in at least a decade for me, but I'm pretty disappointed with the results here. I love the new Blind Guardian album, but they only released the single in 2014. I don't like the idea of them winning everything they were nominated in just based on that one song, as great as it was. \u000a\u000aI'm also a bit disappointed to see Sabaton win so much. Heroes is great, but I felt like it was a relatively standard effort in a year where many other bands stepped up their game (HammerFall, Edguy, Freedom Call, Dragonforce, Sonata Arctica, etc.). \u000a\u000aAlso, I can't believe Kiske didn't win his category. Perhaps I overstate the influence of the two Keepers albums, but without those power metal is a completely different genre of music.\u000a\u000aWith that said, Blind Guardian and Sabaton are awesome bands, so it's really not that bad. 
p1394
aVI can say that in future awards we'll definitely be taking another look at the process to see what we can do to improve it.\u000a\u000aAnd there will be more Lifetime Achievement Awards to distribute - Kiske is definitely a deserving name to win one in a future year.
p1395
aVOn the first point: at the end of the day, it's still a poll voted on by the majority. Even if I wouldn't vote for them based on one song, a lot of people did, so it's not like it's unfair. \u000a\u000aAnd for the second, it might be better to do more than 1 person in a year. It's similar to a power metal hall of fame: there are more deserving candidates than there will ever be spots. I just personally think Kiske is far more important than Hansi. 
p1396
aV&gt; I just personally think Kiske is far more important than Hansi.\u000a\u000auhh....
p1397
aVWouldn't be special if everybody got a lifetime achievement award. 
p1398
aV&gt; Best Lyrics: Sabaton - Heroes\u000a\u000aWait, wasn't this a joke nomination?\u000a\u000aHonestly, these results are rather disappointing. I'm happy that Noble Beast won best unsigned, but it's hard to even tell people about that because the rest of the results kinda bring the whole poll into question. (That's not to say that Blind Guardian and Sabaton didn't deserve to win something, just not *everything*.)
p1399
aVI love me some Sabaton and I did enjoy that album but honestly this was one of the best years on record for me and I'd love to have seen other stars shine through instead of yet more Sabaton and BG.\u000a\u000aBut expectedly this is the popular vote so the biggest and most known bands are going to get voted in even though Sabaton's was a pretty standard offering and BG had only JUST put out a single and it was already overshadowing everything else.
p1400
aVWell it looks like Blind Guardian are going to take out most of this years categories with the new album, but Symphony X could still release something amazing this year. Fucked if I know how Sabaton won album of the year, let alone anything else.
p1401
aVThis is why we need a separate tier for BG and high exposure releases.
p1402
aVI'm definitely open to changes being made in future years, but these things are always going to come down to circlejerks. It's a popularity contest and nothing more. It's also worth mentioning that Keldian, an unsigned band largely unknown in the power metal scene, won AotY in 2013.
p1403
aVDodged a bullet by not having to present this travesty of a results set 
p1404
aVAhahaha. Amen.
p1405
aVNobel Beast did such an awesome job! 
p1406
aVI'm glad to see I'm not the only one who thought Blind Guardian's nominations/wins are not without question. Granted, this should have been mentioned when the nominations took place, not when the winner is announced. Hindsight or whatever...
p1407
aVI know that there are some complains about BG being the winner in most categories, but (please do not shoot the messenger) what other band was hyped and spoken about during the last three month on r/Powermetal.\u000a\u000aThe moment they announced the new Album back in November there was not much left which was posted in the forums.\u000a\u000aJust look at the top scoring links for last month.....top six are all Guardian links.\u000a\u000aThere was no mentioning of Sonata Artica who published a really good Album, or Evergrey with "Hymns for the Broken" or Iced Earth with Plagues of Babylon which all came out in 2014.\u000a\u000aNature of the beast is that the one who get's mentioned last will be remembered. \u000a\u000aSo maybe this year we will try to member Bands who's album came out before November.

p1409
aVAlong with the other posters I'm kinda disappointed that Blind Guardian (and Hansi) won all the awards that Sabaton didn't win, after only releasing a single, since they are going to win them all (and rightly so) this year for their latest album. Also unless I'm mistaken didn't /u/unlosthorizon win the same award last year? Not that he doesn't deserve the recognition or anything. I can hardly argue with the results anyway since I worship Blind Guardian as much as everyone else on this subreddit. Thanks for wrapping this up for us /u/Edledhron after it was left unfinished by the old mod. Congrats to all the well-deserved winners and [here's](http://ooligan.pdx.edu/img/cheers1.jpg) to another year of awesome Power Metal.
p1410
aVYou linked to Albedo by viathyn instead of Cynosure (the song) at the end\u000a\u000aDarn, Noble Beast won best unsigned as expected. Can't complain much because it's a kickass release, although I liked Cynosure better. Wow, BG and Sabaton won like everything, I think we should tier this awards setup a bit more or else it is more of a popularity contest. Something like "Which was better, BG or Sabaton" as a question or "Best Big Release".
p1411
aVThanks for pointing that out - fixed!\u000a\u000aAwards like these will always be a popularity contest, unless we radically change the format. It's literally just an open poll. However, we can make changes to the Awards in future years if people would like that.
p1412
aVI'm kind of disappointed, but I understand the huge popularity variable makes the biggest difference. I just hope no one forgets the incredible releases in 2014 from DragonForce, Galneryus, MindMaze, and Twilight Force. I'm glad to see Falconer and Noble Beast up there though. Also, the new font on the right-hand bar is so sexy! 
p1413
aV100% with ya on Galneryus and, to a lesser extent, DragonForce and Twilight Force. \u000a\u000aSabaton's album was good but not *that* good IMO.

aVExactly the same here!\u000a\u000aI first got into power metal when I was wandering around the cd section of a large retail where I saw "Symphonic of War" by Magic Kingdom. \u000a\u000a"Pretty cool artwork", I thought. I wrote down the name in my phone, came home and googled it. I ended up reading a review somewhere that mentioned "Rhapsody of Fire" and I clicked the youtube link for "Emerald Sword".\u000a\u000aThen it all began. I liked that song so much that I all saw and heard for a week were motherfucking dragons and swords.\u000a\u000aSymphony of Enchanted Lands is absolutely amazing!

aVIt really is a timeless classic. That and Holy Thunderforce are my favorite Rhapsody songs.

aVHoly Thunderforce will forever and always be my favorite Rhapsody song.

aVImho, that's not even Pathfinder's best song. I mean, the instrumentation is absolutely fucking awesome, but it breaks all my windows!
p1441
aVIt's not everybody's taste really, I personally love it but I've heard people complain about the erratic changes in vocal pitch, which I get how some people could find it annoying.
p1442
aVIt reminds me alot of the vocal style in Lost Horizon, which can only be a good thing imo.

aVAwesome to see how this song has brought so many people into Power Metal o.0 It wasn't the first PM song I ever heard, but it was the first one to make me wonder "is this some kind of specific genre? Because I want more of this!" 
p1450
aVDawn of Victory was my first one. I used MSN at the time and there was a voice... emoticon (or whatever those were called) with the intro my teenager self randomly found. It went from "this song is pretty cool" to "Rhapsody is awesome" fairly quickly.
p1451
aVThis was the first power metal song I've listened to and it was what got me into the genre (I was already listening to a lot of symphonic metal via Nightwish and Epica before though).

aVAs a release that came out of *nowhere* (I mean, who had ever heard about this band before?), I found it quite impressive. Not top tier stuff, but impressive nonetheless.\u000a\u000aHow about I do Avantasia after Neonfly, then? I'm already familiar with their whole discography and it would be a matter of picking songs, so that should be done relatively quickly.

p1526

p1527
aVBoth songs are equally awesome!
p1528
aVI would argue Sunset on the Golden Age is better, but only because I take the full context of the song into account and what it represents. Obviously "Sunset" refers to the waning years of the Golden Age of Piracy. The atmosphere of this song is the best part - in all the sections I can feel the decay as the world falls apart.\u000a\u000aThe slow buildup in the first two minutes is the captain seeing the tide changing, a new age arising, one where he is not welcome, one where the rules of how he, his crew, and his friends have lived for most of their lives. A melancholic glance out across the sea paints the picture of a man who know the only constant is change, and there's no stopping it.\u000a\u000aThe next few minutes represent preparations for the inevitable. The pirates know they are going into battle. They know few will survive, that their tropical paradise will be a smoking crater, despite other pirates denying it, unaware of the naval invasion about to come. The pirates are readying themselves despite the odds, even as the temptation to live as they had before with their blissfully ignorant friends haunts them.\u000a\u000aFinally, the stark change where the guitar turns electric at 6:02. Judgement day. Endless enemies on the horizon. The ones who were unprepared panic as mortars fall. The ones who were prepared do what they know they have to do with a great sense of urgency. \u000a\u000aThe captain tells the crew what he was thinking about earlier in the eerily calm beginning, sort of a last-minute pep talk to get them to face death and beat the odds. As they make their escape at 6:58 or so, they set sail, watching the destruction behind them but also looking at the armada in front of them. They prepare for battle.\u000a\u000a7:37. The battle begins. It doesn't last long, but the maelstrom is intense. Several pirate ships sail quickly past a few naval ships. A rapid firefight ensures, and several pirate ships are destroyed by cannonfire, but the navy can't stop them all as two or three break through.\u000a\u000a8:00. The crew made it through. The naval ships are no longer in pursuit/the ones that were have been damaged too much to pursue. The crew know this is a Pyrrhic victory though, because they sail away into both a literal and figurative sunset. They are unwelcome wherever they sail. \u000a\u000a9:40. The sun has set. Night has fallen. The entropic decay begins to consume them. Their once adventurous lives are now basically over. Homeless, they sail and survive, but are they really even living anymore? This is where the song truly brings in the atmosphere that it started in the beginning to its conclusion. These pirates don't just simply fade away, they rot away as the corrosive salty ocean kills them far more slowly and painfully than the naval forces ever would...

aVAmen, brother
p1620
aVMe either. It's good but it didn't blow me away. I am not a musician and a lot of the more complex progressive stuff on the album went right over my head.
p1621
aVI don't mind a little cheese, but I can't stand it when a band doesn't even try to say anything. I mean, bands like Alestorm, which are basically comedy acts, are one thing (WOODEN LEG! WOODEN LEG! WOOOOOODEN LEG! I'VE GOT A WOODEN LEG! WOOOOOODEN LEG!), but it's another thing to just excrete vaguely fantasy/metal-sounding words into a microphone without any real message or story. THE WARRIORS ARE FIGHTING THE DRAGONS WHO FLY WITH THE WIZARD'S MAGIC HIGH UP IN THE SKY! THEIR SWORDS ARE CLASHING UNTIL THEY ARE DEAD, SO RAISE UP YOUR FISTS AND BANG YOUR HEAD!
p1622
aVNot sure if you've actually paid attention to Alestorms songs, but most of them do tell a story, if somewhat self-contained one. They go against giant squids, go to the future to fight space-squid, they tell about being spipwrecked.\u000a\u000aClearly you have not been paying any actual attention to their songs.
p1623
aVYeah, that's like half of their songs, they do tell stories and their songs tend to be well written and cohesive but they also have their more general stuff about being a pirate and life at the sea and then they have stuff like: Wooden Leg, Wenches &amp; Mead, Surf Squid Warfare, Scraping the Barrel, Midget Saw, and a few more. These are all goofy songs but they aren't bad some of them are actually quite ingenious, for example: Scraping the Barrel is Bowes showing the middle finger to anyone who thinks that their music is just Running Wild rip offs; Surf Squid Warfare is about traveling to the future to save the world from undead space squids... yeah it's fucking stupid but it sure trumps on all generic fantasy non stories about dragons swords and magic.
p1624
aVBowes founded Gloryhammer as well. First time I heard the album I thought it must be a parody band, but they nail the fucking story on that album. Yea it's stupid, but it's fun. The aspect of power metal that I enjoy most is the fun the band's have with their music. Hence my love for all things Sammet
p1625
aVNo, no, you misunderstand. I love Alestorm, and I get what they're about. They tell stories, but the stories they tell are, more often than not, completely ludicrous (they have a song called "Surf Squid Warfare;" this is not a band which takes itself too seriously). My point was actually that their lyrics, while silly, are some of the better ones in the genre for this very reason.

If the title on YouTube is crappy/in the wrong format/has superfluous text, fix it.\u000a\u000aCommentary goes in a comment! Don't talk about how great your song is and then never refer to its name. Don't make a self post with a link to the song.\u000a\u000aDon't link into a playlist, unless you're intending to share to the whole album. Even then, full album links are preferred. (It's always crappy when part of the playlist gets taken down.)
p1630
aVAs long as you get the band and title in there, I don't mind a tad bit of commentary. Sometimes it varies it up. But those that don't post a title or band are awful clickbait.
p1631
aVCheese =/= bad automatically! Hell, it can lead to huge success. Look at Manowar, they're quite popular even though they're telling tales of warriors deeds. Alestorm, while not as cheesy as some, telling about pirates life is cheesy to a degree. Plus, they seem to be more popular than the seemingly more serious Swashbuckle (though given that Alestorm doesn't go full-on death-growl like Swashbuckle, that might help them reach a wider audience).\u000a\u000aHell, large amounts of cheese can be fun. Look at Gloryhammer, they're basically your fantasy-based power metal taken to to it's natural escalation. It's like those fantasy novels that tell an epic tale of glory. It can be fun and relaxing to read something more light-hearted in tone after reading something heavier for a while.\u000a\u000aSure, if you don't have a certain amount of joy in doing cheesy PM, then it can suck. You have to have fun doing it and yet be at least believable in the context of your songs. For an example of trying to be cheesy (at least seemingly) take a look at Kontrust's cover of Hey DJ! First of all, the outfits don't fit the theme of the song very well, even if they are the bands typical stage outfit. Also, the woman seems to be using auto-tune to purposefully to peak the mic and it sounds annoying. Their own song Just Propaganda works better since for one the woman isn't peaking the mic like in Hey DJ, and the visuals match with the bands style and the song.
p1632
aVI think you'd struggle to find power metal fans having a problem with cheesiness. Even the least cheesy of power metal is still very much so by most people's standards. I don't think I've ever seen someone criticize Gloryhammer, for example, for their cheesiness. Regarding what is perceived to be overly-generic, uninspired, and uninspiring songwriting? Yes. But not their cheesiness.
p1633
aVI wasn't aiming at power metal fans alone, but the metal community as i have perceived it... Sure most PM fans probably won't have problems with it, but then come in the "Trve kvlt" schmucks... I hate those idiots...

aVTo be fair, all of /r/Metal hates those guys too

aVAnd yet i have seen more than my fair share of them seemingly get upvoted there, at least before...
p1636
aVThis is true. There is actually quite a bit of power metal band fandom over there. There is just a small group of haters out there. But you see Sabaton, Rhapsody of Fire, and BG posted a lot. In fact Blind Guardian has the privilege of being added to the legendary black list, as in stop posting their stuff, everybody knows about them and most everybody likes them. I think Sabaton needs to be added to it as well.\u000a\u000aAlso I think horror, zombie, demonic, and dark imagery themes are just as cheesy as people flying on dragons, and wizards. But I still like it all anyway.

aVDear Power Metal bands that use unclean vocals in otherwise clean songs: PLS STAHP.\u000a\u000aIt ruins your music. It adds NOTHING. Unclean vocals is not characteristic of Power Metal. It is a gimmick. Just because you can and everyone else does it, it doesn't mean you should do it.\u000a\u000aPM with unclean vocals is FINE. Just promote your music as "Power / Death Metal" or whatever, so that I know to stay the hell away from it.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Jimmies were rustled.
p1640
aVHarsh vocals add so much. 
p1641
aVJust because you don't like it doesn't mean it doesn't add anything. And harsh vocals aren't a gimmick. They're a cornerstone of half the subgenres in metal. If you haven't noticed, plenty of people here like bands like [Children of Bodom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv-oswyPzak), [Crimson Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJh7fSr0cRc), [Scar Symmetry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mebSi4PDC34). While those bands aren't necessarily power metal, you can't listen to those songs and tell me that clean vocals would be an adequate replacement. Harsh vocals bring something new to the table, and they bring an element of anger and intensity that so many power metal bands are lacking nowadays. 
p1642
aVSince when is Power Metal supposed to be angry? I always figured that the core of the genre was to be uplifting and motivating. Harsh vocals convey anger, like you say, and that's why it sucks in a genre that is supposed to convey happiness, courage, and serenity.\u000a\u000aIt's just an opinion.
p1643
aVHarsh vocals aren't always necessarily meant to convey anger. [Equilibrium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yom8nNqmxvQ) and [Ensiferum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv0CRm94ObE). Both bands' lyrics are very similar in theme to power metal, and both could be considered uplifting. Harsh vocals are just an additional way to convey intensity and urgency in a song.\u000a\u000aEven with that mind, power metal doesn't have to be uplifting. Sonata Arctica and Kamelot are the prime examples of this. Power metal doesn't *have to* convey happiness, courage, and serenity. Bands that use harsh vocals to be uplifting in melodeath are aplenty (Amon Amarth, Wintersun, Gladenfold), but even the power metal bands that use it for anger, depression, hatred, etc... have every right to do so. The whole mentality of "power metal is supposed to be happy and cheesy" is what pigeonholes the subgenre. When Blind Guardian makes a song that isn't ultra-happy, people don't go around declaring it as "not power metal", so why is harsh vocals given the same treatment? Just because it doesn't sound happy doesn't mean it can't still be power metal. I'm not saying harsh vocals are a key ingredient in power metal by any means, but it certainly doesn't negate or belittle their music in any way, unless your own personal opinion dictates so. \u000a\u000aThe way I see it is this: if clean vocals are the main source of vocals in the band, then they can still claim to be power metal (provided the instrumentation is suitable, which is usually not an issue). \u000a\u000aI've always preferred my power metal to be depressing and more grounded in reality; lyrical themes like those of Fairyland, Rhapsody, and Twilight Force can only be used so much before I start to get tired of them. At least with Sonata Arctica, Kamelot, Triosphere, and Cain's Offering the lyrical themes are something I can relate to a bit more. And all those are undeniably power metal (Triosphere is prog/power, but who cares). Just because it's not happy, doesn't mean it's not power metal.
p1644
aVThat does put things in perspective for me. I mean, I'm on one extreme end of the harsh vocal appreciation spectrum, so I rarely think about how others experience it. My main gripe is with bands who use harsh vocals *just because it's a thing*, sounding terrible in otherwise decent music. I really feel that Elvenking's music quality is lower because of their random bursts of unclean vocals, but I'm probably in the minority there.\u000a\u000aRegardless of how uplifting the instrumentation may be, bands like Equilibrium and Ensiferum will still feel like an angry bunch to me, because of the harsh vocals. That's just how I experience it. As a timid person who avoids confrontation in real life, I certainly don't want people yelling at me while I listen to music. Hence my bias towards happy PM.
p1645
aVYeah I love melodic death, traditional death, folk, thrash, and some black metal as well.\u000a\u000aMelodic death metal bands like Bodom, and Kalmah are among my favorites.\u000a\u000aTo add more to Fazermint's original comment, I think harsh vocals are ok in power metal if they work within the context of the song, see [Kamelot - March of Mephisto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV_94f3CsPQ) or [Rhapsody of Fire - Reign of Terror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nItx9Rkyc8)
p1646
aVI agree, harsh vocals *can* work if it fits the song. Reign of Terror is a masterpiece, I'll give you that.\u000a\u000aIt may sound like I contradict myself. Yes, I find harsh vocals unpleasant to the ear, but on rare occasions I find them tolerable (such as in Reign of Terror). My complaint is that most of the time it's just so out of place, as if bands googled "how to maek metalz" and grunting was the top search result and they went with it.
p1647
aVCould you please give some examples of bands or songs that do this?\u000a\u000a(Genuinely interested in what you're talking about)
p1648
aVA lot of folk/power bands do this. Like Elvenking. I really love most of their stuff but it would be so much better without the growling that they throw in at some points. I like folk music, so I'm pretty disappointed that almost every folk band use harsh vocals, which apparently has become characteristic of the genre (hence my gimmick remark, no single folk song has harsh vocal and it isn't a necessity in metal).\u000a\u000aAn example of regular power metal that does this is [Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrg4PybSgd0). Just... ugh.\u000a\u000aAnd the only thing that keeps Sabaton - Twilight of the Thunder God to be perfect is that one segment with harsh vocals. I know the source is Amon Amarth, but if you're gonna make a non-harsh cover, why not do it completely?\u000a\u000aJust one man's opinion, though.
p1649
aVFolk metal is inspired by folk music; it's not like you found electrical guitars in folk music either. Clean vocals are rare for folk metal though and it's a shame, but harsh vocals, in my opinion, doesn't necessarily make the piece bad.
p1650
aV[deleted]
p1651
aVTrue enough.
p1652
aVI'm pretty sure Equilibrium would be my favorite band if they had clean vocals. Their writing is glorious but I can't stand the vocals.
p1653
aVI obviously understand the nature of this thread, and its a matter of opinion, but I don't think you can say it adds absolutely nothing. I can't even think of many bands that use them, but Elvenking's growls, for example, are amazing in the middle of a song and definitely add something. And they certainly cannot classify as death metal. 
p1654
aVMy main gripe is actually with Elvenking. I want to like them, but it's like they don't want me to :/
p1655

p1659
aV* In a thread where people post unpopular opinions   \u000a* Calls someone idiot for their opinion  \u000a\u000aSmooth stuff. I wonder what you want to achieve with it. 
p1660
aVI mean, you don't have to like it, but then saying completely illogical things such as those is just annoying.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, isn't this arguably the best thread to have opinions about opinions?  \u000a\u000aAnd damn, do you ever take things seriously.
p1661
aVThe things I say make perfect sense to me. I know most people would disagree (I'm not retarded in any way, I'm actually quite lucid), but the sole purpose of these threads is to voice your *unpopular opinions* without things getting personal. Sure, you can say you disagree, but do so in a civil manner. Calling me an idiot on top on insinuating I'm an idiot on a multiple occasions, that's just not classy.\u000a\u000aIt becomes difficult to take you seriously when you act that way (it also doesn't help that you completely ignored my PM about helping out with the weekly release threads). I can hardly believe that I have to tell someone on the moderation team to not be an ass. Not to mention obnoxious - acting as though your respect was something sought after and would hold more argumentative power than something more civil (look at how /u/UnlostHorizon replied). If I cared AT ALL about personal attacks, I would be long gone from this sub. If you want me to take you seriously, then give me something worth taking serious.
p1662
aVI could write a big long post to defend myself, and help you understand, but I don't want to continue the drama I never meant to create, so I'll be as brief as possible.\u000a\u000aI meant to stir your shit, but I didn't think you'd take it that seriously. I thought you might have settled down a bit after my posts telling people not to take things seriously.\u000a\u000aYou're creating drama in a stupid and silly thread meant to stir shit based off a silly and stupid comment meant to stir shit.\u000a\u000aYou're not an idiot, I don't actually think that. Calm down and learn to throw shit back once in awhile instead of making into something so dramatic. Take a lesson from mushmancat on that one.\u000a\u000aI hate to be all serious and what not but I do those same things to friends and such. It's not meant to be taken seriously, and I don't hate anyone here - we're all mighty, power metal loving warriors on the same team. &lt;3\u000a\u000aCan I go back to being an ass now?\u000a\u000aEdit: I never meant to ignore your PM. Not that it's something you should be bringing up outside of PM, but yeah, never meant to ignore you. I read it while busy and forgot about it.  I had school while working a lot so I've been very busy. I have worked 11 of the last 12 days for example, and I'll have some days off soon to catch up on things, and school is a non issue now. I apologize for that.
p1663
aVWell, all right. It's hard to tell if people are serious behind plain text. I'm not one for drama, but when someone says idiot I drop the skittles.\u000a\u000aI'll need to learn to be more Mushman-y, then. And no worries about the PM thing, the weekly threads aren't much work anyway. It was mostly an issue of getting variation in the recommendations as suggested by /u/Edledhron, which is pretty much taken care of by involving /u/MadTheMad and /u/omegakingauldron.\u000a\u000aI'll get back to eating skittles and listening to awesome (clean-vocaled!) power meturls.

aVI think that The Great Divide is one of the better Allen Lande albums and that Timmo Tolkki wasn't a complete hack on this one.
p1671
aVThough I much prefer the sound of the other albums it was getting a bit repetitive. So yea, Tolkki was a nice change of pace.
p1672
aVI tried listening to Lost Horizon and I was highly disappointed that I wasn't able to get into them. The riffs and keyboard sound didn't particularly appeal to me for whatever reason, and heiman's vocals (while very good) were not as mind blowingly incredible as they'd been hyped up to be. still good, but probably not something I'm going to be listening to much in the future
p1673
aVI gotta say, I'm a little disappointed with their song construction. A lot of their stuff seems like a bunch of random musical phrases roughly glued together.

p1680
aVWhatever's in that link set off the web blocker at work.  Animated stop sign and all.  Sabaton truly is the heaviest power metal band.
p1681
aVSomething I hate are albums that go too long. I know albums back in the days of vinyl could only be 45 minutes long (which meant no filler), but some bands that have to have that 60-70 minute album of main content annoy me greatly. That means lots of filler and unneeded songs. (unless there are bonus tracks adding up to that, then I'm more relaxed on this)
p1682
aVHigh pitched vocals do not always equate to good power metal, or even good singing for that matter. Gimme someone that has alot of badass range, or hell even someone that sounds like a grown man. I think thats what drew me to Sabaton and Matt Barlow era Iced Earth. I even prefer when Fabio sings in his deep opera voice than when he shrieks all balls out like. However i appreciate it all. Fucking power metal man. Cheese it up!

VIf you guys want to laugh a bit, go check out the comments on DragonForce's Facebook page after they posted this and Blabbermouth's news page. It's a hilarious cesspool of butthurt elitists who are mad at both groups.\u000a\u000aI'm fucking delighted.

aVVan Canto gets flack? How? They're awesome!
p1691
aVSimilar reasons: a lot of people see them as a silly gimmick.
p1692
aVFor a while, one of the best bands for me to sing with was Van Canto. The lead singer's range was just at the right pitch for me.
p1693
aVMetal seems to have the most disparity among fans. Lots of 'em are awesome, and the small, loud majority that sucks... really sucks. \u000a\u000aThe intro riff with the super-DragonForce-y lead and the very nice chuggitty-chugs in like the first minute was wonderful. 
p1694
aVWhat's funny about metalheads is how closed minded many of them are. Not all of them, but a good many are so quick to say "This is metal, that is not metal" or "This genre is better than that genre". \u000a\u000aThere are two types of metalheads when you boil it all down. The kind who listen to it because they relate to it and enjoy the energy, and then there's the type who are just angry douchebags who need music as angry as they are. They tend to be very touchy, anti-change, and very vocal about it. 
p1695
aVMy issue is that babymetal are like the rest of j-pop in that they are put together by a producer, don't write their stuff and besides being the face don't contribute much else. Which is completely the opposite of what most I listen to be it jazz, blues, rock, or metal just most anything that isn't pop from the last 30 years.
p1696
aVWell, the lead singer wrote the lyrics to this new song, so that's something. But all that you're talking about is behind the scenes stuff. For example, Jani Liimatainen wrote two songs for Stratovarius' latest album, but you would've never known that had you not read the liner notes of *Nemesis*. You would never know that Dave Mustaine wrote tracks for Metallica, Matias Kupiainen wrote songs for Arion, or that Bob Katsionis wrote tracks for Kamelot and Epica, and yet no one cares because at the end of the day it doesn't matter who wrote a song. You can wave the "*my* music is genuine" banner as much as you want, but all that really matters is how a song sounds to someone, and if anything else is factored into your judgment of a song/band/album, you're not listening to music for the right reasons.
p1697
aV&gt;but all that really matters is how a song sounds to someone, and if anything else is factored into your judgment of a song/band/album, you're not listening to music for the right reasons.\u000a\u000aThat's just simply incorrect. If that's all you seek for in music than good for you but I seek way more in music and not just how it sounds. From the types of instruments, to technicality, to atmosphere, to the number of people in the band, to the structure, to passages, to transitions, to riffs, solos, production, lyrics, order of songs, and so on...\u000a\u000aMaybe that's why I'm so picky :/
p1698
aV&gt; From the types of instruments, to technicality, to atmosphere, to the number of people in the band, to the structure, to passages, to transitions, to riffs, solos, production, lyrics, order of songs, and so \u000a\u000aAnd all those contribute to how a song sounds to an individual. What doesn't contribute to how it sounds is who wrote the song, which is what /u/deka01 was talking about. You wouldn't care if Blind Guardian put out an incredible song written by James Hetfield, and that's the point I'm trying to make.
p1699
aVI'm gonna say that's an exaggeration and you'd be pretty stupid and metal-ignorant to not notice the difference between a Blind Guardian song written by Hansi and André and a Blind Guardian song written by James.\u000a\u000aAlso, the person/s who writes the song is the most direct influence on the sound so I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
p1700
aVBut then the issue is that the song doesn't sound good. His issue was that the girls themselves weren't writing the music, which is asinine. Furthermore, you kind of missed my point. I did say that the song was an incredible one that James Hetfield wrote. Hypothetically, let's pretend the song is perfect to you. Are you really going to let the fact that someone other than BG wrote it be a factor into your enjoyment of it? If it helps, replace Hetfield with someone like Tuomas Holopainen who has a much more similar style.\u000a\u000aWhat I'm trying to convey is that it shouldn't matter who wrote a song. What should matter is how it sounds, and along with that is included all those elements you mentioned earlier, as well as stuff like consistency. To think of it another way, let's use Sonata Arctica and *Reckoning Night*. Using /u/deka01's logic, someone could say "I like 'My Selene' (written by Jani Liimatainen) more than 'Misplaced' (written by Tony Kakko) because Jani wrote that song and I like Jani more as a person". \u000a\u000a
p1701
aVThis Unlost guy is being ridiculous. I really don't understand his points at all. And you aren't being picky by wanting quality music over corporate productions. You're just being a metalhead. \u000a\u000aUnlostHorizon: \u000a&gt; What I'm trying to convey is that it shouldn't matter who wrote a song.\u000a\u000aThis is the argument of a "music" fan that Sabaton parodies in their songs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnRZFnf9q7c
p1702
aV[deleted]
p1703
aVBut that's the norm in J-pop. The difference between manufactured music in the US and in Japan is that it's not a mark of shame there. It's embraced wholeheartedly. They know how cheesy and manufactured it is, and they love it.\u000a\u000aI try to appreciate that genre from a purely performance-based standpoint. Are they good performers? Is it a good live show?\u000a\u000aOtherwise, there's no point in ever listening to it except that it's catchy.
p1704
aVI think it is ridiculous that they get so hurt over it, but I suppose that they also like dragonforce the way it was.\u000a\u000aQuite frankly I don't like baby metal because I think it's a gimmick. It's not enjoyable to listen to on its own as  their singing feels subpar to me.\u000a\u000aBut if some people enjoy  that, good for them. Why not.\u000a\u000aAs far as Sam and Herman Li? They've always liked to do things for fun and I hardly blame them for doing this, I bet they had a laugh and it was enjoyable all around.
p1705
aVif they were an elitist, i don't think they would be listening to dragonforce, let alone power metal.. but yeah 
p1706
aVDF has elitists?
p1707
aVoh yeah, I used to be one about 14 years ago. I calmed down/grew up a  bit..I wonder who the elitists are these days, makes me chuckle to think
p1708
aVThat's pretty funny, among power metal, dragonforce die hard fans were always a bit too elitist.
p1709
aVTo be fair, teaming up with a manufactured pop idol group isn't really something I would look forward too, if a band I like did it.
p1710
aVWhy?
p1711
aVForgive me for being elitist, but a group of little girls, designed to be otaku bait, performing music written by idol managers with the intention of making money, just doesn't feel very metal to me.
p1712
aVFirst off, you can't really consider them "otaku bait" anymore, especially since they went viral, played Sonisphere and Heavy Montreal, and collaborated with DragonForce. They're obviously appealing more to the metal community than anything else, since that's where the vast majority of their fans came from.\u000a\u000aSecondly, who cares whether something feels "metal" or not? It's an arbitrary term that people just use to describe bands they like and don't like. For all I care, this could feel "EDM" to me and I'd still listen to it. The "idol managers" who put this together are huge self-professed metal fans (look up some interviews with Koba-Metal) that put the group together to utilize the lead singer's powerful voice. If anything, it's a project of love for the idol managers. If they really wanted to just make money, they would've just put together another J-pop idol group. It took BABYMETAL four years before they got to a level where they were making money. It's definitely manufactured quite a bit, but the lead singer wrote the lyrics for this new song, so there's an obvious growing appreciation that they're developing for metal, and for someone who had never listened to metal before when they joined the group (at age 12), some respect needs to go out to her.\u000a\u000aIt's completely OK to not like their music, but saying they feel a certain way to you is a bit ignorant and dismissive.
p1713
aV&gt;Secondly, who cares whether something feels "metal" or not? It's an arbitrary term that people just use to describe bands they like and don't like. ... It's completely OK to not like their music, but saying they feel a certain way to you is a bit ignorant and dismissive.\u000a\u000aThese sentences alone make this post an early contender for post of the year 2015!\u000a\u000a
p1714
aV&gt; Secondly, who cares whether something feels "metal" or not? It's an arbitrary term that people just use to describe bands they like and don't like. ... It's completely OK to not like their music, but saying they feel a certain way to you is a bit ignorant and dismissive.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI can't disagree more with this sentiment.  Every musical movement that starts as a counter culture is absolutely defined by a "feeling".  There is a reason Black Sabbath is considered the birth of metal instead of Deep Purple or Blue Cheer.  Metal's ethos is tangible, its been around for 30+ years and doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Also what will continue are these fads that pop up every few years and inevitably die out because they can pretend to be metal all they want, but when it comes right down to it, they aren't.  Glam Metal and Nu-metal are two examples. I'd throw babymetal in there, but in reality, they have such a niche appeal that they will be completely forgotten in a few years. \u000a\u000aI'm not saying don't listen to them. People should listen to whatever they want, but can we please stop pretending that Babymetal embodies the spirit of metal in any way whatsoever?\u000a\u000aEDIT: It was hard conveying my point without sounding kind of like a dick, I just want to clarify that wasn't my objective.
p1715
aVWhat exactly is the spirit of metal? If it's wide enough to accommodate Sonata Arctica and Burzum, I don't see how it couldn't fit in Babymetal too.
p1716
aVThe first two aren't a manufactured pop group.  They write their own music.  They knew what metal was before forming a metal band.  There are glaring differences from where i'm standing.  \u000a\u000a
p1717
aVWell, to each their own view on the 'spirit of metal' then.
p1718
aVFirst off, props for the Blue Cheer mention.\u000a\u000aSecond of all, some people say the exact same things about power metal. They claim it's a fad for hyperactive nerds who need some D&amp;D in their music, and they spout the "it's not metal" saying towards power metal too. Maybe not here and in /r/metal, but give stuff like Blabbermouth a visit and see how bad it truly is. \u000a\u000aFinally, I have never said that BABYMETAL are a metal band. They're a J-pop group with metal backing that are receiving huge support from parts of the metal community, a bit like Ghost B.C. Calling BABYMETAL a fad is a bit pointless, since they're the only group doing what they do with any meaningful number of fans. Saying idol metal is a fad is like saying "progressive death metal with violins" is a fad. I'm not saying it won't die out; I'm absolutely sure it will within the next couple years, but BABYMETAL is not counter-culture. No one's saying that BABYMETAL is embodying the spirit of metal. In fact, most people will tell you that they're almost a guilty pleasure, but saying something doesn't feel "metal" is a bs scapegoat argument. Saying you don't like the vocals, the j-pop influence, or the instrumentation is completely valid; saying it doesn't feel like "metal" is like saying "this band isn't good in my opinion, thus they can't be metal". It's the same crap that people like Slipknot fans and Trivium fans get from elitists that say "that's not real metal". \u000a\u000aI'd much rather get an actual explanation from someone saying why they don't like a band rather than just saying it sounds different than everything else I listen to.

p1723
aVI was at Brixton in London the night they played/revealed this song for the very first time...\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere was incredible, and hearing the studio version of this song, just cements how amazing this song sounded when they played it live, the kami-band nailed it that night
p1724

aVLucky sons of bitches. I would make the drive to see them, but I don't think a festival performance of 30 mins would be worth it. \u000a\u000aIn any case, they're definitely announcing more US tour dates for 2015 soon.

p1739
aVgood for them
p1740
aVAre the other girls just backing vocals or something? The wiki lists their jobs as being scream and dance but on the handful of baby metal songs I've heard this is the first to have anything remotely like screaming.
p1741
aVIt's a bit misleading. It's just those three girls doing vocals. The two younger girls, Yui-Metal and Moa-Metal, do screams and dance, but by "scream"  they actually mean shouts. They're not doing the growl vocals. [This older song of theirs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2Tu-g-_rEE) illustrates it pretty well. The younger girls do the "screams" at 1:18 and 1:23. But in the pre-chorus and chorus where you hear actual growls, that's done by an unnamed vocalist, not the girls. \u000a\u000aDon't be surprised to hear them try to growl in the future, though. Other idol metal groups have started making their members growl in their songs, and plenty of BABYMETAL's songs have growls. The first album is incredibly diverse in that regard.

aVOh man, Mindtraveller would be so sick! I can't wait for more of what you've got, Falconer or otherwise :D\u000a\u000aKeep rocking!
p1782
aVThanks a bunch bro ^_^ - Looking forward to it!
p1783
aVI listened to your power metal videos because the one you linked is awesome.  You are great. I'd give you more constructive criticism but I'm not an expert on vocals.  I just know I like it. I'd like to see you cover Colours of my World by Vision Divine.
p1784
aVAppreciate it so much man! And that's ok, as long as it sounds good that's enough for most people :) - I really loved "the perfect machine" the album, so maybe something off that would be cool too - I'll check that song now \u005cm/
p1785
aVUpdate - It's a great song!
p1786
aVHey bud sounds great! Just one little bit of criticism (nothing to do with your voice). \u000a\u000aTighten up the camera shot. Your hand movements make me feel kind of awkward and distracts from the song a bit. Other than that, well done!
p1787
aVYer man I completely agree - I need a better camera to be honest haha...the one I bought promised full 1080p HD, yet it doesn't deliver :( \u000a\u000aI'll probably get a nice one later in the year, but I appreciate the comment man!
p1788
aVI like your Falconer cover.  Your voice reminds me of Mathias Blad.  You have some room for improvement, so keep up lessons and practice.  Maybe start looking for a band?  There are a lot of guitar players out there, but most can't sing.
p1789
aVYer I agree - this is only the beginning! I really love Mathias voice so I take that as a massive compliment! - Yer I'd love to get a live band but unfortunately, Power metal is not very popular in Australia :( 
p1790
aVYeah, but you have Black Majesty
p1791
aVThey are indeed awesome - but unfortunately in Melbourne so I don't see them so much...I think if I moved there I could find a band easier but ideally, I'm hoping to move to find a band in Europe and move there instead :)
p1792
aVA bit of criticism if you're interested: this is just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt. I'm a classical singer, not much to do with power metal but I think some things apply.\u000a\u000aThere are just two things I would say: when you go for the high notes, try not to tense your jaw, and try to keep your larynx low. Instead, try to darken the vowels a bit and open your mouth. You can definitely get more power if your larynx is lower because it allows for more resonance.\u000a\u000aOtherwise good job!
p1793
aVNo way man - This is GREAT! Classical/Theatre/Opera singers know what they're doing and I REALLY appreciate it cause I think my technique isn't as hot as it could be :)\u000a\u000aI'll try to work this into my practise and focus on it!
p1794
aVIn that case I would definitely recommend taking some classical technique lessons.\u000a\u000aClassical singing is (IMO) the healthiest technique there is. It's all about relaxing your voice to unleash its maximum power. A good singer can sing over a symphonic orchestra and still be heard without hurting himself.\u000a\u000aSinging can be dangerous, and without proper technique your risk of damaging your vocal cords. That being said, it doesn't have the grittiness you get from metal singers. But I think there is a way to find a balance between rock singing and classical, something that sounds great with a power metal band but that doesn't hurt your voice.\u000a\u000aAnyway that's just how I see it. Plenty of my favorite metal singers don't have anything close to a classical technique, and it always amazes me how they can sing after so many years of screaming.\u000a\u000aGood luck!!
p1795
aVYer I have been trying to get lessons with this opera singer but he's too busy - I will try to find something else nearby, but ultimately that would be the goal!\u000a\u000aYer I agree and that would be wonderful...I'm working on improving little by little in order to not harm my voice long term (it's something I regularly worry about) so hopefully it can strengthen and grow normally :)\u000a\u000aHaha, yes I often wonder how Hansi Kursch can still sing after all these years but there you go! Thanks for the replies man, you're epic!
p1796
aVAlso, if you don't mind me asking, how old are you?
p1797
aVHaha not at all bro - 21 :)
p1798
aVOkay, you look a bit younger. 21 is a good age for singing. But you voice will change a lot, it won't fully mature until you're in your 30's. Just be careful! If you're doing something at it hurts, tenses or grates, stop and try to figure out a way to not do that. I can't stress how important vocal health is!
p1799
aVHaha, I'll take that as a compliment ;) - But yer I know very much to be careful...and I think at present with what I'm doing I give myself enough room to grow without overworking/damaging my vocal cords - I often "tense" my vox so I'll endeavour not to do so in future - Appreciate it man, seriously - the last thing I want is to be unable to sing after all this training!
p1800
aVIsn't that what happened to the guy from Dragonforce? Just blew his vocal cords to shit?
p1801
aVApparantly he left due to "insurmountable differences of musical opinion" - And is apparently working on new stuff...I'm not 100% sure - I just don't want it to happen to me!
p1802
aVWow - I'm blown away by everyone's kind words! Seriously can't thank each one of you enough for the feedback - It's hard to find people who love the genre sometimes (especially here in Aus!) so I appreciate it greatly! This is really just the start for me, I've been properly singing for just over a year but I think the future is very exciting and I can't wait to see where it leads!\u000a\u000aIf anyone wants to collab/talk metal just swing me a message on my Facebook account (https://www.facebook.com/michaeleastwoodmusic) and for those asking about my band here's the link; there's only 2 songs with me currently, but we are working on a full length album this year: https://www.facebook.com/pages/InnerDream/64105666297\u000a\u000aI'll endeavour to post a song cover a week on YouTube in the meantime - The next few years are going to be an amazing journey, it'd be an honour if you came along too \u005cm/\u000a\u000a
p1803
aVEpic voice! You've already covered Falconer, Kamelot, and DragonForce who have some of my favorite singers. Try covering Symphony X, Twilight Force and Pathfinder. Simon Kostro (Pathfinder) is my favorite singer. He has godly vocals that might be a good exercise for you. I'm not a singer, but this hopefully steers you in a good direction for inspiration :)
p1804
aVHey man - Thanks so much for the reply! I love the singers from these bands - And Yes I have plans for these other bands, though I need to listen to them more also! Simon Kostro is UNREAL! Thanks again :D
p1805
aVI'd say you've got a great career ahead of you! Keep at it, I wish I could sing like you.
p1806
aVThanks heaps brother - a lot of time, work and practise so nice to know it pays off :)
p1807
aV[Cover this cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nukof-nzdXA). It's a challenge.
p1808
aVHaha, I was like "I know this" - It's a pretty impressive cover, Tony Kakko is awesome!\u000a
p1809
aVSounds great man! You have a really nice tone.
p1810
aVI Really appreciate this comment man - Cause there's nothing I can do about it, so I'm glad it's nice xD - I'm working on bringing a nicer, warmer touch to my top end but I think my voice will change as it matures also - Thanks for the comment!
p1811
aVI've played guitar for years now. I can tell you when it comes to making a band, finding a vocalist is the hardest part. \u000a\u000aYou sound great and it's clear you're very passionate about music. Keep it up. 
p1812
aVThanks man - Yer music has become my life! It's so awesome though - hopefully I can find an awesome band in Aus and start getting some live exposure :)
p1813
aVMuch like the others, I am impressed by what I saw.\u000a\u000aYour cover of Elegantly Broken was superb.\u000a\u000aIn terms of criticism, I felt like perhaps you held back a little bit on the elongated notes in your earlier uploads. In the Seasons cover, however, you showed progress in that regard. Considering that the 2-3 month period between those uploads, which is a significant portion of your short training experience, you are working your way through this already.\u000a*Disclaimer - I have no idea what I am talking about.\u000a\u000aAll things considered, you are well on your way. Having more power metal here in Australia is *music to my ears*.
p1814
aVThanks so much man - I think that was one of my better ones too so I appreciate you taking the time to watch it :)\u000a\u000aHaha, yer it's just powering/strengthening and feeling comfortable with things - But I really appreciate the feedback as it all adds together to make me better :)\u000a\u000aThat's awesome bro! I'm in Brisbane, what about yourself?
p1815
aVI'm also in Brisbane.\u000aHave you found much of scene for power metal around these parts, or is it generally a collective of various metal genres?\u000aI know there have been a few PM bands that have toured here, though I've managed to miss all of them.
p1816
aVSo sick man! I don't really think there's much of a scene for Power metal unfortuantely...It seems that metalcore and similar genre's rule our music scene...it just lacks melody for me and often is just noise (just my opinion) - Judas Priest/Dragonforce are playing in a few weeks and I'm soooo keen- If you end up at the gig give us a buzz and we can meet up/have a drink :D
p1817
aVWho knows, maybe you'll be part of the power metal revolution here, wouldn't that be something?\u000a\u000aI'd love to go to the concert... Though I can't. I didn't miss the other bands by choice, health problems keep me doing much of anything right now. Still, maybe some day down the line.
p1818
aVHaha yer that'd be something! All good man - Wish you all the best with your help, we'll put a raincheck on that drink :)
p1819
asVWhat happened to the mod?
p1820
(lp1821
VIt seems that /u/speakmouthwords has stepped down. He sent out invitations to myself and three others, so who accepts among them will be your new mod team it seems. It is a bit of a sudden change, but we'll make sure that things continue to flow well. \u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: As far as the future goes...\u000a\u000a1. I've stickied the latest power metal releases thread, so you all can enjoy that.\u000a\u000a2. The power metal awards will continue operation soon, I'm just waiting to hear from our former glorious leader on where things currently stand for those.\u000a\u000a3. With the other mods and with all of you, we can discuss what things you'd like to see in the future: more weekly threads? Making use of the subreddit wiki? Etc.
p1822
aVAll hail the new king!
p1823
aVIt's for the best. Congratulations! :D
p1824
aVI've moderated a subreddit of similar size.  \u000a\u000aTo warriors here, go easy on the mods.  They provide a service to you and are not paid.  If you have a request of the mods, do not create self posts saying something like "I think we should have the mods do blah" or "I'm having some issue." Instead, use the [message the moderators] link in the sidebar.\u000a\u000aTo the new mods, good luck, and don't let a handful of false warriors upset true metal.  Reddit's spam controls are decent, but not great.  Reddit administrators aren't helpful dealing with problem users.
p1825
aVSelf-moderation has worked pretty well here so I would really only want to see faster reaction to spam and maybe a theme day every so often.\u000a\u000aI hope you three have a bit thicker skin than it was shown many on this sub had a while ago
p1826
aVThere will be one more joining us, assuming he accepts the position.\u000a\u000aNothing too much will be changing. Like you said, self-moderation has worked well, and so long as it continues to work well action will only be taken against that content which really doesn't belong (spam, overly-aggressive unpleasantness, etc.).\u000a\u000aSpeaking personally, I would like to try out having more regular, 'official' posts (weekly threads, album discussions, etc.) That will depend on community reception though, but it's something to try out.\u000a\u000aMy current idea for the wiki is to move the essential album list and associated posts there, as I think that would be better organization-wise. We can try out some other stuff to flesh out the wiki as well.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of the essential album list, after the 2014 awards are over with, that being reexamined has been a popular topic, so I'd like to explore the extent to which people want to see it changed.\u000a\u000aI think there's also a handful of users deserving of flair which can be addressed soon.\u000a\u000aThis has sort of turned into the 'future plans' post, but it's just a rough sketch of things I'd like to see. You guys and the other mods can chime in too! The basic gist is that /r/powermetal is going to remain the subreddit that you know and love, hopefully just with a few new bonuses too for subreddit enrichment -- and nothing's final. Once the dust has settled a bit, and the awards are over, we can discuss the matter more deeply.
p1827
aVoh, I also have a small specific request. If you could [update the stylesheet](http://www.reddit.com/r/powermetal/about/stylesheet) and add this line:\u000a\u000a`.link .score.unvoted{color:#666666;}`\u000a\u000aThat would be great. The current unvoted score count is pretty hard to read, depending on the window size due to the background. This just makes it a bit darker. It fits nicely on line 167.\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/TEU50Lo.jpg
p1828
aVDone.
p1829
aVAhah - I thought something looked different!
p1830
aV&gt;.link .score.unvoted{color:#666666;}\u000a\u000aah, the most metal of all hex color codes\u000a
p1831
aVyou can actually just use `#666` and it'll still work
p1832
aVI'd be interested in album discussions, maybe the top new release of the week? Although I feel like we could just end up with the same people, namely the more active/influential members of the community, doing most of the posting.
p1833
aVThat's pretty much what happened the last time we had regular album discussions. However, we do have some more people now, and I think if the threads were 'stickied' they might have more success. I'll be starting them up after the awards are over.
p1834
aVMore regular posts to instigate discussion would be fantastic.  The weekly releases is a great start, and I hope that continues (looking at you, UnlostHorizon!).  I love the idea of album discussions; a great start would be Beyond the Red Mirror.  A single thread for discussion of the album, with a suggestion that people sort comments by "new" to keep the discussion flowing.\u000a\u000aI am not sure what the wiki might entail.  The problem with creating a wiki, in the traditional sense at least, is that there are so many other archives (Encyclopedia Metallum being a big one) that already have much of what is necessary.  The wiki pages would need to be unique, I.E. the essentials list, or maybe band history, or extensive lists of interviews, etc.\u000a\u000a\u000aRe-examining the essentials list seems like a no-brainer to me.  Either it gets updated, and people are more content, or it stays the same.  Maybe some guidelines to suggestions, such as not albums you personally enjoyed, but albums that had an impact on the power metal world.\u000a\u000aAs for flair, I will be keeping an eye out, as well as Edledhron (he has already addressed a few) to see who is deserving of flair.  Contribute more and be a positive member, and your chances of receiving bad-ass flair increase!
p1835
aV&gt;and I hope that continues (looking at you, UnlostHorizon!)\u000a\u000aUnfortunately I don't think we'll be able to count on him for those. Unless someone else takes it over, I can start with those next weekend.\u000a\u000a&gt;a great start would be Beyond the Red Mirror. A single thread for discussion of the album, with a suggestion that people sort comments by "new" to keep the discussion flowing.\u000a\u000aDefinitely agree with that. I'd like to get through the awards first though - that'll be a week or two depending on how voting goes. The good news is we already have over 100 submissions!\u000a\u000a&gt;The wiki pages would need to be unique, I.E. the essentials list, or maybe band history, or extensive lists of interviews, etc.\u000a\u000aThat's what I'm thinking. The essential album list, pages for our past awards, links to the AMAs we've hosted, etc.\u000a
p1836
aVNo no, we can't count on him - was just making a point, in-case he is lurking.\u000a\u000aAye, makes sense, though the magic of the new album might wear off a bit at that point.  Actually... it's Blind Guardian, who am I kidding?
p1837
aVMaybe have some resources for finding new music. Sites like [this](http://www.music-map.com/blind+guardian.html) or [this](http://www.gnoosic.com/).
p1838
aVWhat about work on a hall of fame similar to what /r/progmetal is doing?
p1839
aVIt's something we can bring up when we start having those discussions. Personally, I'm not in favor of that. I prefer an album-based approach, and their process is rather ...inefficient at producing a finished list.

asVA guide for my journey into PowerMetal
p1854
(lp1855
VCheck out Lost Horizon. They only released two full lengths, but they are both heralded as prime examples of power metal almost universally.
p1856
aVThanks! Listening now - they have a really varied sound, it's really interesting. 
p1857
aVThe song that got me into power metal was [Sonata Arctica - San Sebastian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA0IAbizUfg), maybe you'll like it as well. Sonata Arctica is quite an interesting band if you haven't checked them out. Their composition in songs gets more complicated as you go through their albums from early to more recent. (Except for the last two albums but let's not dwell on that)
p1858

aVHibria - The Skull Collectors, Masterplan - Aeronautics and Kamelot - The Black Halo are my go-to albums for power newbies. \u000a\u000aIf you can dig some progressive elements in your power metal, then Seventh Wonder are easily my favourite band of all-time. Listen to the Mercy Falls album.\u000a\u000aIf you like any of those, I have several hundred more to suggest.
p1861
aVThanks, I'll get on these. Though.... I don't think it's necessarily a newbie thing. I've listened to a fair number of albums in the sidebar, which is how I picked the songs out that I mentioned. What I'm looking for is specific songs that are similar to the ones I've found that I really like. For example, I like Dragonforce and all, but from the whole of Inhuman Rampage one song REALLY does it for me. 
p1862
aVIt's just that the range of bands you mentioned are all entry-level power metal; it's not a negative thing whatsoever, it just meant I could suggest some more well-known bands right off the bat :) Each of those albums are super melodic, and I, like you, have a heap of albums from bands that I generally dig, but only like a song of two of. Each of my suggestions hold strong variety with very different melodies. Hope one clicks with you :)
p1863
aVAwesome - and good point, the best anyone can do is get me close. I appreciate it!

aV[Crystal Night is awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssVjOtbyfBk)

p1868
aVI can't help you too much trying to find individual songs\u000a\u000aBut if you're into classical stuff, then Avantasia's first two albums (The Metal Opera pt 1 + 2) might appeal, as might any of Fairyland's stuff (try the songs "Of wars in Osyrhia" or "Score to a New beginning" for a sample. Also I definitely spelled Osyrhia wrong.)\u000a\u000aOtherwise maybe try some Neoclassical stuff like Dark Moor or Yngwie Malmsteen?\u000a\u000aMoving on - I see you like Pathfinder's Fifth Element, I would make sure you listen to Pathway to the Moon, Stardust and Beyond the Space Beyond the Time from their first album if you haven't already.\u000a\u000aIf you like longer stuff, check out Symphony X's Odyssey (the song, 24mins long, has an orchestra).\u000a\u000aOtherwise I'm not sure how to help you.\u000a\u000aThe Australian band Domain have a lighter sound, you may wish to try them- the songs "Last days of Utopia" and "A New Beginning" are good.
p1869
aVThis is great, thanks. I always expect to like Symphony X but for some reason every time I give an album listen I just... I dunno, maybe I build them up to much and I'm not listening objectively. 
p1870

aVIn response to what u/Vortiene said (not linking to to the chain so you get the reply directly):\u000a\u000aIf you do find yourself getting into Sonata Arctica and start to do some research, you're going to find some very polarizing opinons on the more recent half of their discography.  \u000a\u000aI stress to you that you give all four albums (Unia, Winterheart's Guild, Stones Grow Her Name, and Pariah's Child) an honest chance.  None of those albums were necesarily 'bad', but it's hard to find a majority of people who find any of them 'good'.\u000a\u000aStarting in Unia, SA got very experimental with their sound, leading to folks being split about what works and what doesn't.

VDon't change genres on the god damn articles. I have enough reverting of that to do as it is to people who edit wikipedia when they can barely understand english. Needs sources that indicate the genre to add genres. Removing genres should just not happen, as they should have sources that indicate them. The carnage on Epica's article was great as well.\u000a\u000aFor your laughs:\u000a[Genre warrioring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Genre_Warrior)\u000a\u000aI had some guy tell me I couldn't change Riot's article to be called "Riot V" because their frontman died, and it was "disrespectful" to talk about anything after he died. Needless to say, that guy got banned for preventing the development of an accurate article. When responding to my comments asking why he would do things, he would literally copy half of what I said and reverse it in order to make a counterpoint. I could tell he could not reasonably understand english. \u000a\u000aAlso Ecliptica was legitimately rated 2 stars by Allmusic, which is a reliable source. Can't help that Antti J. Ravelin didn't like ecliptica. Eduardo Rivadavia gave Reckoning Night 4.5/5 on allmusic, so at least he likes them.\u000a
p1927
aVSilly question, but... is it pronounced "Symphony X" like the letter or "Symphony Ten"? How about V--is it Vee or Five?\u000a\u000a\u000a Why does it say deceased under Tobias Sammet under the section Vocalists
p1928
aVFrom Wikipedia:\u000a\u000a&gt;Michael Romeo about the origin of their name: "So, you know, the music we were coming up with had the keyboard thing and the guitar, and some classical elements, so the word \u2018Symphony\u2019 came up and, so the dramatic thing, you know? So then, somebody said \u2018Symphony X\u2019 and we were like, \u2018yeah, that\u2019s cool\u2019 it is that kinda thing, **and the \u2018X\u2019 is the unknown** and all the other stuff we do."\u000a\u000aSince they're using it as a variable, and not a value, it would be the letter, not the number. Also, in interviews they pronounce it that way.\u000a\u000a"V" clearly represents 5 for the album (Roman numeral V on the cover, it being the 5th album, and part of the story behind the album has to do with the magic of five). While most places online I've seen just refer to the album by the short name "V" (the letter), when talking with others about it, I typically hear people refer to it as "Five".\u000a\u000aAnd people like messing with others for some reason - Tobias isn't dead, thankfully.
p1929
aVI have it on good authority that there are, in fact, two separate bands with very similar names: "Symphony X" (pronounced X, like ex) that almost every fan of power metal knows and "Symphony X" (pronounced ten, like the number). To further confuse you, Symphony X (the number) released an album simply titled "V" (like the letter, vee), but it is actually pronounced as five (like the number).\u000a\u000aThe good authority is a local used record store, they wrote "Symphony Ten - Five" for the listing. They couldn't have made a mistake, right?
p1930
aVI always believed it was a nod to Beethoven's alleged tenth symphony.\u000a\u000aGranted, I always called it Symphony X (the letter), but it's not a horrible guess I suppose.
p1931
aVI have a feeling the last comment was made by WishmasterTheDark. He's pretty notorious in youtube for forcing his opinion down other people's throats on what is (and mostly what isn't) power metal, complete with bad english, internet tough-guyism and everything. 
p1932
aVThe genre disputes are hilarious. Regarding the definition of "progressive" in Kamelot's section: "it mearly [sic] means experimenting in diffrent time signatures".  \u000aOh lawdy.

asVThis Week in Power Metal Releases (12/22 - 12/28)
p1978
(lp1979
VLooks like it's up to me to step up to the plate. Besides, there's two releases this week I already know I'll be listening to (they're both EP's though), so I might as well do this write-up again.\u000a\u000aMy opinions (based upon previews only):\u000a\u000a* **Havenless:** Very meh. It's a decent length "teaser", so it's more than adequate for previewing the new album, but there's honestly not much going on worth noting. It's like a melodic death metal album with the speed turned down and the production quality turned down too. There's not much too say here, because I know most power metal fans won't be interested by this, and even death metal fans will get bored by this like I am.\u000a\u000a* **The Unguided:** Recommended for fans of Sonic Syndicate, Disarmonia Mundi, Mutiny Within, and Blood Stain Child. This teaser is entirely way too short for me to get an iota of how good any of the songs are, but my guess is that it won't be too far removed from what *Fragile Immortality* sounded like from this year. Here's their video for "[Inception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brLwlB8j0JQ)"; check it out. The album was pretty decent, if a little repetitive. I'm gonna guess that this new EP will be similar.\u000a\u000a* **Incursed:** I've already listened to this album in full, and it's quite good. The Ensiferum comparison is definitely warranted, as would a Wintersun comparison. It's a fun album with some decent melodies leading the songs, but I just wish it was faster. I feel like that's my complaint about half the albums I end up hearing. Anyways, this track that is linked is one of the best tracks from the album, and you'll notice clean vocals during the chorus. They sound a lot better than they did when Wintersun tried them on the self-titled album. This is a bit more obscure, but if any of you checked out the Heidra album for earlier this year, this is pretty much the exact same thing, and I mean that in a good way. \u000a\u000a* **MinstreliX:** The track that's linked in the OP is from their 2014 album, *Chronostrings*, which is as close as you're ever gonna get to a Galneryus clone. They're pretty good at what they do, but the album tended to blend together. This new EP is a rerecording from some of their very early material (and one new song). [Here's a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZx7BHbZELI) to one of those old songs that's being rerecorded. I don't know if they're rearranging or adding in anything new to the songs, but the originals are all pretty great neoclassical power metal tracks. However, they had a pretty bad production and an even worse female singer at the time, so this could be a huge improvement for MinstreliX. So definitely check this out if you like Galneryus or Jupiter.\u000a\u000a* **Mistweaver:** This isn't half bad. It'll be too heavy for about 50% of this subreddit, but it does feature an operatic female singer backing up the lead vocalist, and some of the passages are superb (especially the one at 2:05). So here's a link to "[Hell's Arrival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNaaJUlbyZQ)". It seems like I may have to give this one a listen. This second song is much more of a death metal song, but it seems very well done. I'm not sure what to compare this one to...maybe a more melodic Emperor? In any case, this is recommended for you death metal listeners.\u000a\u000a* **Krusher:** It's a Polish band, but the vocals are quite decent. It reminds me a bit of Crystal Viper. The video is quite *out there*, but the song is straight out of the '80s. With that said, it's also really derivative and bland. There's no real identity to the song. It's as if they took *every single* band from the 1980s, removed the really good and really bad elements, and then made a song from that. I don't think anyone's gonna have to check this band out.\u000a\u000a* **My Darkest Fury:** That opening riff gave me high hopes. So I sought out the full version of "[A Road to Nowhere](http://satanath.bandcamp.com/track/a-road-to-nowhere)". Unfortunately, I'm not getting much out of this. The harsh vocals could be a lot better, and the instrumentation just seems to be boring whenever they're not soloing. Much like the Krusher preview, I don't see a real need for anyone to listen to this.\u000a\u000aWhat I missed last week:\u000a\u000a* **Xiphea:** This is a decent way to end the week. It's pretty much a carbon copy of Diabulus in Musica or a less-power metal version of Epica, but that female singer is just a tier below Zuberoa Aznárez and Simone Simons. The grunts are superb, though, so depending on your feelings on female-fronted symphonic metal, this may or may not be worth checking out. This isn't even a new track that I'm listening to, and it doesn't sound too bad. I have to hope that the new album is superior to this old track.\u000a\u000aAnd that's it for this week. Next week should be interesting, mostly because no one in their right mind would release something right before the end of the year. Hopefully, we'll get some musicians who are out of their right minds. 
p1980
aVWell guys, guess which piece of shit is back from his holiday? Also, guess which piece of shit forgot his music, and has been stuck with early 30s &amp; 40s music and Pitbull remixes. This week is going to be full of "Oh this was great!", I can tell already.\u000a\u000aThat's right, get ready, because the master of poor taste and uselessly pretentious breakdowns of great music has risen once again to terrorise the Weekly threads!\u000a\u000aMy Opinions (based on previews only):\u000a\u000a- **Havenless:** I'm really digging the guitar riffs these guys play; it's slower than you would want from a PM band, but has a lot of multi-layered complexity that adds a whole lot to their music. The vocals are pretty decent, the harshness they bring meshes very well with the instruments. Overall, pretty damn good.\u000a\u000a- **Incursed:** This started out sounding less like Dirty Vocals Folk Metal and more like Dirty Vocals in a Power Metal song. Then comes in the accordion or whatever and changed my mind; "Nope, definitely Dirty Folk". And then came the clean vocals. Jesus guys, make up your mind, are you glorious Dirty Folk Metal, or glorious Dirty Power Metal, I can't handle *both* in the one song. This was fucking amazing - harsh, fast, groovy; it had everything you should want from both Power Metal AND Folk Metal in the same goddamn song. The vocals were awesome, and the instruments were amazing. I don't know what to say, I loved it.\u000a\u000a- **Minstrelix:** Hey /u/SinuataBouquet, is the "Old Track" classifier there to say that it's from an old album and they are redoing it or re-releasing it or something? Whatever, I like it. The instrumentation is pretty much the best thing ever, metalising classical music is always brilliant. I love the shit out of the shred. The vocals I think could mesh a little better with the instrumentation at times, but for the most part are fucking great. Overall, I really like the guitar on this one. Oh and the rest of it too I guess.\u000a\u000a- **Mistweaver:** Once again, a song with Operatic vocals that I like them in. Might be the death growls that accompany them helping them out though. The instrumentation is decent, it's fast and heavy, but changes completely seemingly at random, making the song tough to follow, and really makes it hard to enjoy the song. The vocals are decent, both the Dirty Vocals and the Operatic Vocals are used as background instruments for the most part, rather than take the forefront in the song. This really helps to allow them to mesh together well, and both sets of vocals complements the other well, the Dirty vocals break up the slowness of the Operatic, while the Operatic Vocals break up the harshness of the Dirty. Overall, I probably won't listen to it again after this (except to complete my top 20 previews of the year list, even though it most likely won't be there), it was decent, but to aimless and unfocused for me to enjoy.\u000a\u000a- **Krusher:** This was pretty good. The instrumentation was exactly what you expect from Heavy Metal, and the vocals were pretty good. I don't really know what to say about these guys; I liked it, but I can't break it down as to why.\u000a\u000a- **My Darkest Fury:** This had some decent stuff, some super shit stuff. Honestly, twenty second previews aren't really enough enough to comment on. At least Havenless gave us like a minute or so to listen to the song to determine whether we liked it.\u000a\u000aAnd what I missed (I'll get to the other two weeks later):\u000a\u000a- **Xiphea:** You totally missed out this week /u/Fazermint. Just kidding. She sings *so fucking high*. Holy fuck that's agonising. I constantly shit on people who do that in JPower, and it is not going to be different here. It doesn't matter what the instrumentation did, and the dirty vocals aren't going to save it, the clean vocals are so high that they completely at odds to the music.

aVHow long can you live forever.

aVOur singer John Yelland came up with it.  The song title is a reference to the idea/trope of the problems with immortality (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever) that are encountered when one really sits down and thinks about the logical consequences of it.  The song title is essentially questioning how long you could be immortal or live forever in some sort of afterlife before losing your humanity.

(lp2027
VI down-voted nearly everyone's comment in this thread.  Simply put, I really do no want our subreddit to be clouded with rules.  It is not necessary.  The more rules you have, the less character there will be in the sub-reddit.  Too strict.  Just a few simple rules to help keep a community this small civilized and organized are necessary.  \u000a\u000a1) No excessive trolling.  Trolling on its own isn't that bad.  It creates character for users and for a subreddit.  Sometimes it's fun, funny, and unoffensive.  However, when you continue the trolling past the point where people find it funny and it starts bugging people, and you do NOT stop, this is where "excessive" comes into play.\u000a\u000a2)  Post only power-metal related stuff.  If it's "this is a different genre, but I think power metal fans will appreciate it" once-in-awhile it's fine; just do not do this often.  If it's some metalcore thing with no power metal relation, it should be removed.\u000a\u000a3) Posts for songs should contain [Artist - Song Title] format.  The rest is up to the user posting.\u000a\u000aIf there needs to be a sub-list of what "excessive trolling" entails then so be it, but in terms of behavior, I think this is the only necessary rule here.
p2028
aVI think this is all we need, to be honest. Anything more is pretty silly for such a small subreddit. We are fairly self-moderating with downvotes, so aside from avoiding actual trolling and encouraging good content and posting habits, I don't feel that more rules are particularly necessary.
p2029
aVI don't think there is a need for a lot of moderation.  If you want some guidelines on posting, go ahead.  But if you choose to enforce a bunch of rules it will become an onerous task.\u000a\u000aReddit has downvote buttons.  They work pretty well.
p2030
aVWell people wouldn't be posting what they did today if that was 100% the case.\u000a\u000aSo might as well have a clear set of guidelines. Even if they aren't enforced it will give people more reason to downvote stuff that doesn't follow it.
p2031
aVI have a few suggestions.\u000a\u000a1. One additional moderator. I think we need someone who is active and can respond to problems fairly quickly. Actual removals should probably be used sparingly, but we need an active liason at least.\u000a2. Themed days were a fun idea that we picked up on our own for a few days. I'd like to see more of this, and perhaps dedicate a day out of each week where we post songs that follow a theme.\u000a3. Use the wiki more. The depth of the genre and many users' knowledge here is far too much for just a spot in the sidebar. We could have wiki pages for the essential albums list and flesh it out a bit more.\u000a4. As in the other comments, I'd like to see video posts be in `Artist - Song` or `Artist - Album` format. Click-bait titles are often a problem on music subreddits, luckily we haven't had too much yet since we're so small.\u000a5. CSS tweaks. Sometimes comments and text can be difficult to read with the background being as it is.\u000a6. We need to participate in the [Best of 2014 Awards!](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/2p030i/moderators_claim_your_creddits_for_the_annual/)
p2032
aVRule 1- don't overreact and act like the sky is falling because someone wants to post particular videos you don't want. If it bothers you that much the downvote button is there for a reason. Beyond that just get over it, its not certain members responsibility to curtail to your wants and desires. 
p2033
aVRule 5 - When posting a link to a video, say what the video is. If you post the song Land of the Free by Gamma Ray, post it as "Land of the Free - Gamma Ray", not just as a long winded title without the name of the song. (eg. "This is a great Power Metal Song that everyone should listen to.") The same applies to news about artists or newsworthy Power Metal items.\u000a\u000aRule 5.1 - This is not to say an alternate title can't be used. When used in conjnction with the song title/band (eg. [Thunder Themed Thursday] Labyrinth - Thunder) it's fine. Although creativity is encouraged, try not to be too long winded with an alternative title.
p2034
aVWhoa, whoa.  It goes Band - Title, not Title - Band.  This should be a rule as well.
p2035
aVThat's a major pet peeve of mine, along with not italicizing album titles and not putting song titles in quotes. We live in a civilized society, dammit! We have MLA for a reason!\u000a\u000a/s (mostly)
p2036
aVWhat about those who use APA citiation?
p2037
aVThey're the spawn of Satan. 
p2038
aVThe only enforcement I would like to see is encouraging posters to use the search to cut down on reposts and if a band has been posted very recently, maybe don't post them again. Otherwise things get stale.\u000a\u000aOh and song name in the title PLEASE!\u000a\u000aCheck the sidebar before asking a question that could be easily answered just by looking to the right of the screen.\u000a\u000aHonestly, beyond the obvious banning of trolls and zero tolerance for aggressive users and keeping content relevant to power metal the sub sails along just fine as it is. Don't like something? Downvote and/or move along. Simple.
p2039
aVRule 3 - Pay attention to what other users have posted. Want to post a song by an artist? (eg. Hammerfall) Take a look at the front page, even the second page before posting.\u000a\u000aStill not sure? Use the search feature on the right hand side of the page to be certain. (This also helps out for not posting duplicate songs from bands)
p2040
aVRule 2 - If you've seen something (artist, song, news) posted a lot lately and not being very well received, it's best to think twice about posting more of it unless new content (that you think people will like) has shown up.\u000a\u000aThis goes hand in hand with posting content covered on the sidebar. Most people have heard stuff listed on the sidebar already, so it's not something to do all the time. If it's new and related to sidebar bands, then it's fair game to post.
p2041
aVRule 4 - Chances are you are looking at /r/PowerMetal to find new Power Metal related music that you haven't heard before. It's best not to pan, downvote, or even just ignore stuff you haven't seen or heard before; it's more likely in your best interest to check it out.\u000a\u000a(I realize it's not really an actionable rule but I feel it's important to have something like this with rules about posting.)
p2042
aV[deleted]
p2043
aV1) All the posting rules already mentioned  \u000a2) The discourse should be monitored, at least to some extent. Trolling should be taken care of, and generally uncivil comments should also be moderated.  \u000a3) Not really about moderation, but open up for discussions about sidebar additions and maybe even format changes. Perhaps I'm nitpicking, but ordering the albums alphabetically (with band name first) would already go a long way. 
p2044
aVHere's an easy one: take care of spammers and trollers. Maybe give them a warning, then shadowban them if they repeat their offences. Neither spamming nor trolling should be tolerated on any subreddit. I don't even think that's up to debate.
p2045

p2060
aVIt has to due with the 90s and how they fizzled out. I was listening to an interview by either Tony or Paul and how after their tour with CANDLEMASS in 1990 they just lost the drive. I don't really know why when they had these successful tours and albums, but apparently they stopped getting together for practices and each started their own thing or stopped playing music. It would have been interesting to see how they might have developed in the 90s with grunge going around.

VI've been listening to a bit of Japanese metal recently an I am *very* pleasantly surprised at the quality of it. Despite the fact I very much prefer coarse vocals, I really like this.
p2077
aVI know I'm being that guy and must apologize but... Is this really considered power metal? I mean the vocals aren't in any way powerful or soaring, the guitars are typical riffy guitars. Strikes me as typical visual rock?\u000a\u000aBut if you do enjoy Japanese metal onmyoza is well worth checking out (that's \u9670\u967d\u5ea7 if you want to cut and paste it) still probably not power metal
p2078
aVThe sound, the ambience and the musicianship is kinda power metal, but with a visual kei look.
p2079
aVI'd say it is PM. Just because it doesn't sound like typical PM it doesn't mean it isn't. /u/creepy_doll forgot to read the symphonic part of your sentence. Cross Vein would be somewhat equivalent to Nightwish.

VNormally, I'll shy away form live recordings, but the definitive version of this song for me is still the [live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjpPBPlp414) from "For the Sake of Revenge". The crowd chanting "Run away!" Is much more powerful than the band singing backup.
p2102
aVI don't understand "shying away" from live versions.  Thats how the song is supposed to sound.  If a band's live version is significantly worse than the studio version its a sign of a bad band. \u000a\u000aI'm at the point where I almost can't listen to an Iron Maiden studio album because they are so much better live. 
p2103
aVTo me a studio album and a live setting (either in person or a live album) are two separate things, and neither is the 'proper' one. If a band is able to put out fantastic albums, but they're terrible live, it's a sign to me only that they're able to do a great job in the studio, and don't do nearly so well live. I don't see the point in not enjoying a good album due to the group not being able to perform it live.

aVBruce is just getting old, he can't help that. He's still solid and his stage presence is second to none though. As for Janick, hes just going to be Janick.  I think we all know he is just in the band still because they felt bad kicking him out when H came back. \u000a\u000aI still take just about any Bruce area live track up to about 2006 over the studio tracks.  Especially anything from the 80's.  Every track on Beast Over Hammersmith is perfect. Phantom of the Opera and Hallowed Be Thy Name are absurdly good on that recording.

p2114
aVDepite Elias being a reasonably good guitarist, I think they need a guitarist who's more willing to push for a more prominent role in the band , sort of like Jani did.\u000a\u000aPasi I'm not sure, but I like Henrik and Tommy's contributions. Elias is doing okay but still seems to not have enough prominence in his guitar role.\u000a\u000aMost of my issues with the new music aren't related to vocals, drums, keys or bass. They're all good, but Elias on guitar is more often than not just chugging along, no interesting riffs (seriously, on pariah's child basically the only prominent riff that isn't a power chord chug is at the start of Wolves Die Young and running lights), only a bit of soloing (the lower soloing amount I am okay with, but when the guitar seems boring it sort of takes away from the songs, since metal music requires well thought-out guitar tracks due to their prominence)\u000a\u000aI'm not going back to the "bring back Jani" crap, since people have been over that for years, but Elias seems bored in the newer songs. Needs some more interesting stuff to play.

VI read the review and heard the snippets, and it really did sound alot like Blind Guardian, but less "adventure-y". I had never heard of the band before. The cover art is also rocking, the use of only a few high contrast colours makes me think of the artwork on a KMFDM album (I know, industrial band, not metal). 
p2151
aVThe title track is one of my favorite tracks of 2015 so far. Looking forward to this one\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also, someone in my family just heard they've got cancer (which is the subject matter of the album) and will probably be battling cancer for the next decade or so. He's religious and this album seems to have an at least slight religious undertone (e.g. "God's Failures" probably referring to a good man being struck with cancer). I just wonder if it's a good idea to get him this album or if it'll trigger shit.
p2152
aVSorry to hear about your family member. \u000a\u000aJohn Yelland isn't religious, so it's more likely to be critical of religious faith than anything. Probably not a great fit for someone who's religious.
p2153
aVSome folks became angry with deities when someone dies. I can see them being critical, and totally understand and sympathize. \u000a\u000aIf it adds passion to the music, I say bring it!
p2154
aVThanks.\u000a\u000aIf that's the case, then it will probably shake his already shaken faith.

aVdid your KickStarter.  hoping to make it to the show tonight.  \u005cm/
p2166
aVThis is some solid stuff! I really like your vocal style. Just a random question: You're listed as *Heavy Metal* on Metal Archives, but do you consider yourselves more power metal? Many songs on the new album are definitely power metal-y.
p2167
aVPicking genres is such a nebulous process...while my tastes go more towards power metal (I really like the symphonic-backed stuff, especially), a lot of people consider us classic metal, "traditional metal", heavy metal...the list goes on and on. I figure heavy metal is the broadest definition, so we chose to say that.
p2168
aVYeah, that's probably the most sensible thing to do! I'll still consider you guys to be power metal, though :p Out of curiosity, what are your favorite symphonic metal bands?
p2169
aVHmmm...off the top of my head...Sabaton, Nightwish, Lorenguard...hmm, there are probably a lot more, but it's the day after our cd release party, and my brain is a bit hazy at the moment :-)

aVYou know, power metal isn't always my thing, but this is pretty damn sweet. Top notch production job, great vocals too. Missed the CD release party, you guys got any soon-ish shows in the Madison area before your guitarist leaves?

VI was indifferent to the whole "the Swedish version of Carolus Rex is the best version" argument until I heard this with the translated lyrics. It's a shame we don't get to hear Swedish Joakim more often.
p2182
aVYes. This song with the Swedish lyrics is probably the most powerful thing Sabaton has ever written.\u000a\u000aI remember the first time seeing this live was on the 70K cruise in 2013. It was misty/slightly drizzling and I remember looking up and watching the rain come down and it was the most ethereal feeling I've ever had; I still can't describe it. I remember turning to my buddy and saying something super morbid like: "If I died right now, I'd be okay."\u000a\u000aI've only heard them play it in Swedish one time since then (Rockstad Falun 2014) and it was great but nothing like that first time.
p2183
aVThat sounds magical. I remember an experience like that seeing my favourite Japanese band on their first and only North American tour. They finished their set playing my favourite song and kept it going for a good ten extra minutes. I was standing there, smiling like an idiot, completely dumbfounded. I remember feeling the same way, like it was all I needed in life. \u000a\u000aMusic is a pretty cool thing, and I can't wait to see Sabaton again in the spring.
p2184
aVI sort of wish that Sabaton had just used a translation of the Swedish as the English version. I get why they did it how they did, but it takes so much longer to memorize lyrics in a language I don't understand, and I have a harder time enjoying the slightly cheesier English lyrics. I should learn Swedish.

VInteresting how you have Twilight Force and Delain on your top 20 and Mushman has it on his bottom 10. Ne Obliviscaris' album must be incredible though, definitely going to give it a listen. These lists also make me realize just how much good music I'm missing out on. Only one way to fix that i suppose.
p2192
aV&gt; Comments are appreciated; the more aggressive and belittling, the better.\u000a\u000aWhat a horrible list, your tastes are stupid, Japanese power metal is worse than Hitler, BABYMETAL is stupid, you're stupid, and so on and so forth.\u000a\u000aJust kidding, though i won't question your choices (the lack of Noble Beast is troublesome), picking Outloud as your top album is super interesting because in all your top 20, it's the record that imo it's not power metal. Just my 2 cents.
p2193
aVEh, even acknowledging that wouldn't change anything about the list. Just think of Triosphere as being as my #1 power metal album of 2014. Outloud sounds close enough to Firewind that I feel OK about including it with the power metal entries.\u000a\u000aI don't know if you were serious with that Japanese power metal comment, but I only have 4 JPM albums in my list, and the highest ranking one is #10. But don't you dare besmirch the name of Hitler.
p2194
aVI was kidding about jpm of course, it's your list, you can put whatever you feel like it deserves to be in the list.
p2195
aVOh, I didn't know you guys would be that tolerant of my choices. In that case, BABYMETAL is #1 album of the decade.
p2196
aVI fully accept and support BABYMETAL as our new master and overlord.

aVI liked a lot of the list and put it on my "bands to check out". I was surprised to learn that there are so many female-fronted power metal bands out there. \u000a\u000aThere were some I didn't like, mostly because I don't like growly vocals. 
p2198
aV&gt; I was surprised to learn that there are so many female-fronted power metal bands out there.\u000a\u000aThere's a shit ton of female-fronted power metal out there if you look for them. Here are a few bands that didn't make my list:\u000a\u000a[Light Bringer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTPRlS36K0)  \u000a[Albion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW8C_ze5NKc)  \u000a[Cyntia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghauU_VBtDg)  \u000a[Mary's Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLM2unV0kwU)  \u000a[Amberian Dawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNs8Z6W7Y8Y)  \u000a[Fortaleza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNJ34CTdZ-s)  \u000a[Pythia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ6e1ibOd40)\u000a\u000aAs you can tell, most of the decent female-fronted stuff is coming out of Japan, but the really great stuff is coming from elsewhere. There's also a lot of crap, but my top 20 list is completely devoid of that :)
p2199
aV&gt; most of the decent female-fronted stuff \u000a\u000aThat's one of the best parts of power metal vs other forms of rock. Voices that won't fit with other forms of rock work well with it. \u000a\u000aAlbion is a surprise to me. A lot of Japanese music has a huge Enka influence, but they sound very European power metal. 
p2200
aV&gt; I don't like growly vocals\u000a\u000aMah nigga
p2201
aVGreat, I love these posts! :) I've been meaning to check out most of these albums, but my listening backlog is so damn huge... But since everyone is so fond of my opinions, I'll check out the links for your top 10 now (in descending order)!\u000a\u000a* **Outloud**: I definitely recognize the Firewind sound in the riffs here! A pretty awesome crossover between power and hard rock, this. It's not something I'd expect on the very top of your list. I'll commend you for not shying away from allowing pure catchiness play a major role.  \u000a* **Triosphere**: I've been meaning to get into Triosphere for a while now. I've heard this track before, but listening intently to it now really has me sold - this is some of the best power metal stuff I've heard, female-fronted or in general.  \u000a* **Sonata Arctica**: I'm a huge fan of SA. I enjoyed Pariah's Child, but I'm surprised to see this album in everyone's top list. Granted, *The Wolves Die Young* is a killer track and arguably the strongest one of the album, I generally thought the album was quite quirky. I have an odd fascination for the track *Half a Marathon Man*, which is most likely the most catchy song I've ever heard. The rest have obviously not made a lasting impression, since I don't remember any of them. That's just me, of course. Don't get me wrong, Pariah's Child was most definitely a step up from the previous two albums, but I'm still waiting for the "real" SA to come back.  \u000a* **Vanishig Point**: Oh yeah, the intro kicks so much ass. At first I thought 'Hey, this sounds really much like SA..' then I figured out it features Tony, lol. The band's own vocalist is pretty damn stellar, too. This is what SA would sound like if they did progressive metal, probably.  \u000a* **DragonForce**: I don't think there's anything better than DF when it comes to speed metal. This stuff is so over-the-top and awesome! The new vocalist does a good job, and the riffs and drums are, computerized or not, just awesome.  \u000a* **Black Fate** I thought I was the only one who liked Black Fate! In the weekly release thread, I think the rest of the crowd were either indifferent or even deriding this for having a bad vocalist (iirc). I didn't personally make the link between this and Roy Khan, but now that you mention it, holy hell they sound alike! Now I like it even more. Incidentally, the link is another one of the 'Topic' uploads, meaning it's unavailable outside the US. I couldn't find an alternative video for *In Your Eyes*, but I've listened to *Lines in the Sand* repeatedly for a month now.  \u000a* **Ninth Circle**: Mixed feelings about this one. I like the short opera parts, but the rest doesn't really do it for me.  \u000a* **Epica**: As I've probably mentioned at least twice already, I'm less fond of how aggressive this album is compared to their other stuff. I know most people either tolerate or appreciate the growling, but I'm kinda wondering why the songwriters decided to take this turn with the latest album. It's almost as if Simone isn't the band's main vocalist any more. You say it showcases all their strong points, but to me it's more like they *forgot what their strong points are*. END RANT THOUGH.  \u000a* **MindMaze**: I'm a sucker for female rock voices. MindMaze sounds pretty amazing. Not really like what is usually posted on this sub (which is a good thing, variation is good). Great riffs, too. Haven't got much more to say, the stuff is amazing and I don't think anyone will argue with that.  \u000a* **Kamijo**: "Bitch I'm fabulous". I've gotta admit, this shit sounds pretty amazing. The intro is nothing short of stellar, and the interlude at 3:something is coolio. I can't really get over how the entire video's purpose is to act as a medium for the vocalist to show everyone just how fabulous he is. Hahaha... Whatever. I guess I should be happy that power metal has a "pop" status in Japan, nothing wrong with spreading good culture.
p2202
aVCan't say I agree with most of your list, and Outloud seems completely out of left field.  I'm also a little disappointed to not see Noble Beast on your list.  I haven't listened to Ninth Circle, I'll have to check them out. I'd like to give a more in depth dicussion, but I have a friend in town(From Japan actually) and I won't have much time for discussion.

aVAny album that still has ~~people~~ elitists talking about it and complaining about it nine months after it came out is doing something right. Besides, what's wrong with a bit of variety? 
p2205
aVAnd what's wrong with a sense of humour too (got to have some for being a power/metal fan amarite..). Nice to see someone put BM on their list, I guarantee there are loads of folk with that on their list like a guilty secret they dont want to admit!

aVNot complaining about Babymetal, I've listened to it plenty, I just [fucking love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7fAWQlMq8) Erdentempel

aVI just wish it were a bit heavier. I have *Sagas* in my top 10 albums of all time, and that's because it's so heavy and Helge's vocals were so much more aggressive. *Erdentempel* was a bit too atmospheric at times for my taste.
p2208
aVI think both albums are awesome, and I cannot agree more on your statement about BABYMETAL. I think BABYMETAL have injected the metal genre as a whole with a new lease on life by just doing something different. (That, and they put on one hell of a live show, having seen them twice this year)\u000a\u000aHere is to another year of great Power Metal and BABYMETAL getting all the elitist's panties in a bunch for a little longer xD

aVIt's not their best, but it's one of the highlights of this year for me. Granted, I haven't listened to a lot of power metal albums in 2014 but I have given considerable attention to the ones I've listened to, and out of those Vetelgyus is the one that grew most on me. 
p2213
aVI'll give it another chance.
p2214
aVYeah, feeling iffy on you including Outloud as #1 on a power metal list.  Very iffy.  Lack of Noble Beast and Freedom Call is insanely questionable, as well.  Oh well.  Seems like I really have to check out Ne Obliviscaris.
p2215
aVi'm not going to criticize your opinions, but i will say this may be the only time i've ever seen anyone compliment kamijo based on *variety*. as much as i love lareine, and as moderately-listenable as versailles is, his solo career is just more of what he's been doing for the past 15 odd years imo.

About 1/3 of the album is vastly different than most Europower you'll ever heard, and even within the album itself, there's a lot of variety (mostly because this is a compilation of singles and B-sides with only a few new songs). 
p2217
aVDefinitely putting stuff on here on my list of stuff to check out. But any list that doesn't say something about pillars of power metal like Freedom Call, Gamma Ray, Edguy, Sabaton, Primal Fear, HammerFall, Iced Earth (to a degree), Iron Savior (maybe Unisonic considering who's in it) to name but a few, even in passing is very unusual. I'm interested in what you thought of these and why they were excluded. 
p2218
aVI mean, it's not like people were raving about Gamma Ray, Edguy, Primal Fear, Hammerfall, Iced Earth, or Iron Savior. They're big names, but they also put out mediocre-to-decent albums this year. Freedom Call had the best release of those bands you listed, but I still can't see myself ever listening to *Beyond* any more than the couple plays I already gave it. I think Sabaton gets extremely tedious to listen to after a while (they're a great live band though). As far as Unisonic goes, the album wasn't bad by any means, but it also wasn't particularly excellent in any way. Even MMC only mentioned a couple of the bands on your list.\u000a\u000aWhy would I mention those bands for the sake of mentioning them? As for the "pillars", I had both Sonata Arctica and DragonForce in my top 5 power metal albums of the year, so it's not like I was intentionally snobbing the big-name bands.
p2219
aVI haven't listened to most of these, so it'll take me a while to plow through them. I did check out Scar Symmetry on a whim (mostly to see what "melodic death metal" is) and I'm very glad I did. \u000a\u000aA bit surprised though very pleased to see SA make it so high on many 2014 lists. \u000a\u000aSeeing the love Falconer's album is getting, I'm surprised I don't see it here, but I never really loved them as much as other people myself. \u000a\u000aI probably (definitely) would have had Sabaton and Noble Beast in my tops (and the more I listen to Noble Beast the more I hate you for not including them), but to each their own I guess. 
p2220
aVCan I protest that we put Triosphere on number one? Though I did expect to absolutely hate Outloud, Triosphere just fucking killed it this time around.
p2221
aVDepending on your definition of power metal, that's something that you can do yourself. It's not as if this list adds credence to any of these bands.

VI'm fucking sick and can't leave home, I'm tired, grumpy and can\u2019t concentrate on anything, take this with several grains of salt and pepper.\u000a\u000a**Satan's Host - Pre-dating God Part 2** - Blackened Black *slash* Power Metal\u2026 What a combo and a strange one at that. I do think it\u2019s a strong song but I feel like the black metal parts suffer from the lack of raw guitar production. The vocals are a big plus.\u000a\u000a**Arcane - Known/Learned** - Definitely an interesting progressive song. Starts really slow and just builds to the second half, if you\u2019re not interested in progressive metal, skip this one. Sense of déjà-vu though.\u000a\u000a**Trial \u2013 Vessel** - Just an okay heavy metal song, there\u2019s nothing special. Can\u2019t really expand on this one.\u000a\u000a**Scanner - The Judgement** - Blazing fast in your face power song, can\u2019t really go wrong with this one. Cool riff, some sweet licks and decent vocals, this one just grabs you from the start and doesn\u2019t let you go.\u000a\u000a**Stormwitch - Season of the Witch** - Weak half-assed song, bad vocals, intro riff shows promise but everything falls apart after that. The lyrics are the big offender here: \u201cThis war is good, this war is bad\u201d \u201cWe are the first, we are the last, warriors, we the first, the last, warriors\u201d. The worst part is the chorus, that fade in fade out wailing voices saying \u201cwarriors\u201d belongs to amateur bands. \u000a\u000a**Illuminata - Where Stories Unfold** - Arf, so dramatic, not in the mood for this one, if you like heavily orchestrated anthems, it\u2019s probably for you.\u000a\u000a**Stargazery - Stars Aligned** - Stargazery? What kind of faggot ass name is that? Musically and lyrically devoid of quality content, keyboards too heavy in the mix, vocals are not good enough. The song just plods and doesn\u2019t get anywhere. Shit solo.\u000a\u000aWhat I might have missed last week...\u000a\u000a**Vexillum - Over the Clouds (Single)** - Good song but nothing special, vocals are weak and kinda hurts the song, the instrumentation is good enough but the drumming\u2019s double bass is a bit too high up in the mix, the solo section rocked my double winter socks off. \u000a\u000a**Inside Mankind \u2013 Oikoumene** - Everything is bad. Everything! The drumming, the vocals, the guitars, the keyboard melodies and even worse, crunched production that creates an obnoxious wall of sound and delivers undecipherable instruments to the song.\u000a\u000a**Automaton - Hot Off the Press (Single)** - Had potential with the quick intro, becomes to tame then and also suffers from some mixing issues, double bass being too upfront and the solo stands out in a weird not natural way.\u000a\u000a**Serious Black - As Daylight Breaks** - Serious Black? More like Serious Power! Kekekeke. In all seriousness (no pun intended), the song starts a bit too slowly for me but it does unleash itself in all its glory all over your face. Well mixed with the double bass being buried just enough and keyboard melodies added tastefully to enhance the song. Great vocals too.\u000a\u000a[Me when I saw the Brock Lesnar gif](http://i.imgur.com/kGeZwrt.gif)\u000a

aVFazermint signing in. Do we silently mourn /u/SinuataBouquet?\u000a\u000a* **Satan's Host**: This ultimately sounds a lot worse than Part 1. Some unclean vocals first, then they switch over to weird-ass high-pitch vocals, and then finally to some normal vocals. Vocal styles aside, this is a pretty boring song.  \u000a* **Scanner**: This sounds pretty old-school. Not that that's a bad thing. Leaning more towards heavy than power, but the instrumentation is solid and there's a cool guitar solo and stuff.  \u000a* **Stormwitch**: I know I'm picky when it comes to vocalists, but I can't be the only one that thinks this is bad. Guitar solo is okay, but whatever. Generic stuff.  \u000a* **Illuminata**: The focus here is on the vocals, which are pretty good. The symphonic instrumentation is decent. However, this isn't nearly powerful enough to get your power metal itch scratched. Good, but hardly PM.  \u000a* **Vexillum**: Glad I got to hear a single from this album, last week was only a trailer. I checked out "Fire and Blood" when it was posted, but this one, "Over the Clouds", is tons better IMO. I love it! Chris Bay sounds great, and the song is catchy as folk power should be. There's pretty cool flutes going on, and the guitar solo is great. Vexillum has a new fan!  \u000a* **Inside Mankind**: Symphonic, Progressive AND Power Metal? All my favorite genres in one! Yeah I had high hopes for this, but uuuugh. I can't get myself to like the voice in this one. The instrumentation is nothing special either.  \u000a* **Automaton**: Oh I dig the album art. Airships are cool. I've played too many Final Fantasy games... The song is pretty cool. The chorus not so much, but the guy's voice is solid and the verses are decent. Instrumentation is very solid. I'm sure this can grow on me!  \u000a* **Serious Black**: /u/UnlostHorizon man, thanks for including this one. I absolutely dig this! Unlike what the name might imply, this is melodic PM, and does indeed bear a resemblance to Masterplan (Roland Grapow says hello). It's a great song through and through.\u000a\u000aAllrighty. My highligths are **Vexillum** and **Serious Black**, both oh which have got a new fan!

The best album of the next few years is going to be released and nothing in those thread will be able to compare.\u000a\u000aThanks for the effort though. If we lived in a world where Blind Guardian dont exist, those would be my #1 reference for power metal release.
p2230
aVWhat, you only listen to BG?
p2231
aVWell, no, i listen to some other band, like Rhapsody and Luca Turilli, but Blind Guardian is the only power metal band that have nothing but good stuff. Everything seem bland compared to Blind Guardian. They are the very essence of power metal.\u000a\u000aIf I buy a band album (which is very rare), I usually listen to it once or twice, take 1 or 2 song and put them in my power metal playlist. Than I almost never listen to the complete album ever again. With Blind Guardian, I listen to at least 1 complete album everyday (and have been doing that for the past 15 years). There is just nothing that compare to the level of perfection they have reached.\u000a\u000aI wish I could find a band that have half as much good stuff as Blind Guardian, but most band have stuff that sound very annoying to me in most song. Like Pathfinder. I love 95% of each song, but that singer have to scream very high note at the end of each verse and it make me want to rip my ear out. I just cant listen to them because of that. Or Iced earth, which everyone seem to like, but to me their music just feel slow and boring (like pretty much any american power metal band)\u000a\u000aThe only band that can compare is Rhapsody, but since 2006 their music have been increasingly more boring to me. Sonata Arctica is another that I liked very much, but now its just terrible. The Ecliptica re-release felt like the band were laughing at their best album. They even had the nerve to put a stripper song on it...\u000a\u000aIf you have any suggestion, I welcome them very much, but I asked many time and nobody ever came up with a suggestion thats as good as Blind Guardian. This is why im kind of apathetic of the genre. I found the best stuff from the get go, and now whatever I listen to, it just wont make me feel warm and fuzzy like Blind Guardian does.
p2232
aVThat's fine and all. I feel the same way about Lost Horizon. I'm sure everyone has a band they admire the same way, but my issue is with this line.\u000a\u000a&gt; If we lived in a world where Blind Guardian dont exist, those would be my #1 reference for power metal release.\u000a\u000aSo since BG exists, you decide its futile to listen to anything else coming out because you know it won't be as good as your favorite band? I *know* nothing will ever be as good as Lost Horizon (a bit of an exaggeration), but I still check out albums every week to hear some good music. You can listen to good music without expecting perfection.
p2233
aVA lot of smaller bands have potential to make something kickass but don't have the motivation. By buying their reasonably good albums (that's if you like them) and showing you believe they can kick even more ass, they may develop into a consistently kickass band. That's why I don't just listen to Sonata Arctica. (Example, Viathyn from their first album to Cynosure only had the drive to continue since people said they really enjoyed the first album and they had the potential to make something really kick-ass. Then they did.)
p2234
aVThe thing is... I dont like most power metal. It just feel bland to me compared to Blind Guardian. The only band that released something I liked in the last 5 years (except Blind Guardian) is Gloryhammer. Im becoming more and more apathetic of the genre as time goes by. Yes I could spend 7-8 hours listening to all those album every week, but I know I wont enjoy it as much as spending 7-8 hours listening to Blind Guardian.\u000a\u000aI use to check every release, but after not finding anything to my taste for so long, I just kind of stopped.\u000a\u000aJust like with death metal, I will go to power metal show and enjoy myself, but I will never put listen to one of those album by myself because I have the possibility to listen to something better.\u000a\u000aIts kind of like eating a normal steak when I have the possibility to enjoy the best Kobe Beef there is. I will always choose the Kobe Beef.\u000a\u000aThere are some song from other band that enjoy as much as Blind Guardian, but those band new release are just not as good as their old stuff. (Rhapsody, Luca Turilli and Sonata Arctica).\u000a\u000aI wish I was more interested in other band, but Im not. I dont know why. Its just like that.
p2235
aVAll right, that I understand. I'm the same way - I mainly listen to the PM playlist I've put together. I'm constantly updating it though, but often only one or two tracks from an entire band.\u000a\u000aI'm perfectly content with listening to only one or two songs from an album, but that's easy to say since I don't actually buy them. (Ohnoes)\u000a\u000aWell, I'm sure you've tried most of the stuff from the sidebar. The albums listed there aren't always the actual best album IMO, but you know. 3 albums that I find myself listening to in their entirety are **Heavenly** - *Virus*, **Masterplan** - *Aeronautics*, and **Fairyland** - *Score to a New Beginning*.\u000a\u000aThere's nothing wrong with hardcoring BG all day every day, I just wondered if you *only* listened to that :P\u000a
p2236
aVBlind Guardian was my first band and remain by far my favorite as well, but there's plenty of great stuff out there, though you have to approach it on the grounds that they're doing their own thing, and not simply ripping off Blind Guardian, and that that's a great thing for them to do.
p2237
aVYou may be onto something there. The first Power Metal band I heard was rhapsody and the second one was Blind Guardian. I fell in love immediately with both those band. They were the music I had been waiting for my whole life without knowing it. Maybe I just have insanely high expectation for the genre because of how I was introduced in the genre. As I said, music from other band just dont make me feel anything. Its very hard to love their stuff, because it dont make me feel warm and fuzzy inside like Blind Guardian or Iron Maiden do.\u000a\u000a&gt;simply ripping off Blind Guardian,\u000a\u000aI wish I could find a band that did that, but since Blind Guardian have been playing music since the 80s and nobody have attempted that, I highly doubt that there is a band that can do it. I kind of feel like Blind Guardian is its own genre from how different it sound from other power metal. 
p2238
aVBlind Guardian certainly is rather unique due to their drawing on symphonic, prog, and folk elements in ways that others don't, as well as André and Hansi both having very distinct styles for their respective roles. They nevertheless are very much power metal, and other bands have drawn inspiration from them or have a similar style. Here's a sample of such bands:\u000a\u000a[Savage Circus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfMvrCg3ANU)\u000a\u000a[Noble Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPn2e5zG1Lk)\u000a\u000a[Falconer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72bJ-_p4olI)\u000a\u000a[Heavatar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7RJkiKAiR8)\u000a\u000a[Triosphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0)\u000a\u000a[Persuader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIge-101ot4)\u000a\u000aUltimately, this stuff is all subjective. If other power metal bands don't do anything for you, there's not really anything that can be done about that. However, it's certainly the opinion of many that there's more than one excellent band in this genre. My first album was Nightfall in Middle-earth - nothing's come close to matching that for me, but that doesn't mean that I haven't found plenty of fantastic bands in the subgenre.

VAn Earbook is basically an oversized Digipak - it's a much larger, hardbound package for the CDs and booklet (which is really more of a book now). Sometimes size is all that's offered - other times there will be more booklet content such as artwork, writing, etc. Earbooks also often come with more CDs than what a jewelcase or Digipak offer.\u000a\u000aThey're basically 'Collector's items.' They're for the people who want something more than just standard CD packaging to commemorate the album while also getting some potential bonus content. They cost a great deal more than a typical album or Digipak because they're for the people willing to shell out that much for whatever bonuses are offered.

p2325
aVGalneryus and X Japan are the only bands I can stomach of the male-fronted ones. For some reason the male singers in Japanese often sound very feminine to me, which gets on my nerves.\u000a\u000aHowever, I have been jamming to some of the female fronted stuff recently.
p2326
aVKamijo from Lareine and Versailles, Asagi from D, and Hizumi from D'espairsRay (probably not Power Metal actually), are examples of pretty masculine sounding vocalists in Japanese metal, amongst others.
p2327
aVKamijo and D are both covered in the next part, btw :)
p2328
aVI don't see how you can think Versailles, Sex Machineguns, and Balflare have feminine-sounding singers. I can easily understand if you don't like them, since Kamijo is a weird singer for sure, Anchang does more of a thrashy vocal delivery, and Balflare's singer can't pronounce English to save his life (even though he sounds no different than most European singers), but feminine-sounding? 
p2329
aVProbably because I hadn't listened to those before. Those sound pretty good. In any case, add Linked Horizon to that list, as I remember liking some of their music now.\u000a\u000aBalflare I had listened to, and didn't like because I can't listen to mispronounced english (I get annoyed by Timo Kotipelto's minor accent as it is)\u000a\u000aI think it's more that Japanese sounds feminine in general to me, which is stupid, but just how it is.
p2330
aVNo worries, as least you're not writing off the entire nation's music because of one nit-pick you have with their language.\u000a\u000aThe next part has some bands with harsh vocals, so I'm willing to bet the language issue won't be nearly as big as this time.
p2331
aVOh I definitely don't write Japanese music off, I have a shitload of soft stuff from female vocalists. (for example, Eufonius)\u000a\u000aGalneryus is the only big Japanese band in my PM portion of the library though.
p2332
aVGreat list! Quite a few bands I haven't heard of. After work, I'll be sure to check them out. Cheers.

aV* **Majesty**\u000a\u000aThe lyrics on this song are fairly open to interpretation. I haven't seen Hansi comment on them himself - I suspect it's about Frodo's journey.\u000a\u000a* **Gandalf's Rebirth**\u000a\u000aInstrumental - title reference's Eru taking Gandalf out of the world after his death, Gandalf's subsequent enhancement, and the return of Gandalf to the world\u000a\u000a* **By the Gates of Moria**\u000a\u000a Instrumental - title references the western bound and entry of Moria\u000a\u000a* **Imaginations from the Other Side**\u000a\u000aThis isn't a song strictly about LotR, but it does have references to it.\u000a\u000a* **The Bard's Song**\u000a\u000aThis will be focused on 'The Hobbit,' but 'In the Forest' also references Tolkien's stories.\u000a\u000aThis song concerns Bilbo in *The Hobbit.* The first verse, third verse, and chorus describe the various events on the way to the mountain. The second verse concerns Smaug's decension on Erebor and Bilbo taking the Arkenstone from the mountain and the dwarves. The fourth verse concerns Thorin's greed and the potential conflict which would eventually turn into the Battle of Five Armies.\u000a\u000a* **Lord of the Rings**\u000a\u000aThis song is about Frodo's journey along with the rings of power. It's worth noting that there's a misuse of the term 'gnome' here, evidently referring to the dwarves. In Tolkien's work, a 'gnome' is one of the Noldor elves.\u000a\u000a* **Nightfall in Middle-earth**\u000a\u000a[See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/25iq2m/the_context_of_blind_guardians_nightfall_in/). It should be more than enough, but I'll get around to putting in further context as well as looking at some of the specific lyrics soon.\u000a\u000a* **Seize the Day**\u000a\u000aThis is actually a D&amp;W song, but I thought I would include it here. The song seems to me to be about Frodo's journey, and especially his decision to depart from the Fellowship. Though the line 'The tower knows who you are' confuses me a little as Sauron did not know who Frodo was, and that was actually a rather important point for the plot. Maybe Hansi got influenced by Jackson's films here?
p2356
aV"Seize the Day" is on Touched by the Crimson King, right? The majority of the songs on that album reference Stephen King's Dark Tower series, so I think this song was inspired more by Roland the Gunslinger and his journey in that series (although King himself readily admits that he loved LotR and was inspired to write his own heroic saga after reading Tolkien). There's also a song on that album about Wilde's Dorian. \u000a\u000aBecause I'm an avid reader, Blind Guardian will always hold a special place in my heart. I really just want to have tea and talk about books with Hansi; is that so much to ask? :)\u000a\u000aEdit: I hadn't seen your post about Nightfall before now, and I just wanted to say that you did an excellent job with your synopsis. Also, thanks for reminding me what a powerful passage the confrontation between Fingolfin and Morgoth is; I reread it since "Time Stands Still" is one of my absolute favorite songs, and now I think I need to give the Silmarillion another reread. 
p2357
aVJon Schaffer actually talked about 'Seize the Day' being about LotR in one of the interviews he did around the album's release.
p2358
aVI think every song has already been mentioned in this thread except for Majesty. Also according to Wikipeida, Run For The Night and Lost In The Twilight Hall are LOTR related but there's no direct reference to the books in the lyrics so I can't say for sure. Lastly, there's IFOTS but only just a couple of minor references in that song.\u000a\u000aAlso while we're on this subject, does anyone find it interesting that (as far as I can tell) BG have not written a single Tolkien related song since NIME? Wonder if it has anything to do with the LOTR movie releases and the books becoming very mainstream. Or perhaps they just exhausted themselves of Tolkien songs after doing an entire album of them. :P\u000a\u000a
p2359
aVI suspect it's the latter, though D&amp;W did have 'Seize the Day.'\u000a\u000aI was sort of hoping that we'd get a few more some day, but it seems that, at least for the time being, Hansi is interested in writing lyrics based on his own stories.

aV:) \u000a\u000aBut these old men understand what it takes! No? What are the details about Pathfinder?
p2378
aVFrom what I understand, it was the record label that put a bunch of pressure on them to rush out a half finished record before the excitement of their debut had died down.

p2382
aVTheir debut is one of the best symphonic power metal albums ever in my opinion. 
p2383
aV:D
p2384
aVThe first album is a goddamn masterpiece.\u000a\u000aThe second album is rushed, and it shows. It had potential, but it was a poor man's version of the first album. "Disappointing" is a bit of an understatement.
p2385
aVGood to know. Thanks to the both of you.
p2386
aVThere are still some very worthy tracks on the second, but it's merely a good album on the whole. The first is *amazing*.
p2387
aVAs /u/mushmancat and /u/UnlostHorizon stated, the first album is excellent, and the second is definitely the worse of the two. However, I think it's still a pretty good album... it at least has a handful of good songs. But it also does show a lot of signs of being rushed, and the lyrics are somehow even worse than on the first album!
p2388
aVIn my opinion, the first album is among the worst power metal albums ever released.

p2392
aVWhat are you doing, why did you post this?
p2393
aVTo inform the younger bands about what it takes to be accepted and popular. Record labels know what works or not. Who wants to hear the music of old people over 30?
p2394
aVThat's not what it takes to be accepted and popular. Saying that a band can't sound like anyone and needs to be progressive is doing just the opposite. Let the progressive bands progress on something but don't pigeonhole them because that's literally the opposite of progressive. \u000a\u000aBands of guys over 30 are almost always better than younger bands, because they are more experienced and better players. This sounds like the kind of record label that ruins bands.\u000a\u000a

I'd like to listen to it at a volume that I control, not through a set of ear plugs that'll just muffle the high end, and in a setting that doesn't reek of beer and weed.

VThey are using 'Flexible Funding' unlike Kickstarter it's not all or nothing. So they'll still get some of the money.
p2453
aVThe new singer has me nervous. I guess it could have been an early draft, but I did not like what I heard in the preview video. Still waiting to get those WAV files they promised for the 5 euro donation, then I'll know for sure.   \u000a\u000aWonder how much money we'd have to pay to just make Simon come back? 
p2454
aVPrimal Alley seems to be an awesome singer, but to me it's like Dragonforce and Nightwish. When they get a new singer, the bands do take a hit for the first album  \u000a\u000aIt's VERY hard to find his Pathfinder auditions online, so we have no idea what we are funding
p2455
aVHa, funny thing is I thought Power Within was a great album, and Dark Passion Play is the only Nightwish album I like. But I get what you mean.  \u000aI've listened to Fifth Element 2.0 a few times now, and I've realized that Primal Alley *can* sound great, but he has a specific range that is very different from Simon's. As long as they write specifically for that range, it might be good. Unfortunately, I think Pathfinder as we knew it is gone either way. 
p2456
aVThat is what happens when you have a new track called Pathfinder is Striking Back, plus a singer which we have heard very little of besides the fairly poor cover of Fifth Element. Oh, and poor "marketing".
p2457
aVI don't know why they're even need those music videos. Regular lyric video is enough i think.
p2458
aVThey could do a better job of selling it, that's for sure.\u000a\u000aI'd rather see them do an indiegogo for the next album, and then use the sales from that to make the videos.\u000a\u000aStill, no one does symphonic metal like Pathfinder and I'm happy to throw money at them - especially for an exclusive "The Beginning" CD. That reward makes it worthwhile whether or not you care about the videos.
p2459
aVDo you know where Primal Alley's Fifth Element cover is? I haven't been able to find it!
p2460
aVI helped the fund; I might give more this week. They're one of my fav bands, and BTSBTT is my fav song. I liked Simon Kostro more than Primal Alley, but when you look at the big picture Pathfinder is still amazing. I haven't really analyzed their marketing of the campaign, but I only see anything on Facebook or email subscriptions. They have about 35K likes on FB, so idealistically they should be doing better. I know Protest the Hero achieved their campaign goal for an album, but they have like 350K likes. I personally don't know how they could have advertised better; hopefully they just get more popular with time. I always tell my friends how amazing Pathfinder is, but one person can only do so much.

(lp2471
VI am confused about people saying the vocals are bad.  The choirs are nice, and so are the lead vocals.  For me, that is not the problem at all, but one of the saving graces.  The album is not bad by any means, but it is overly generic without being memorable enough.  There were a couple of good songs, but the album is only really worth it if you really like the generic style of straight-forward fantasy power metal.
p2472
aVThose were my thoughts as well.
p2473
aVI really like the music, but the singer suck, which is my opinion of most power metal band
p2474
aVI think it all boils down to the bad vocals. Doesn't matter how many times I listen to this, it will always be bad because voice, chants and choirs are all equally terrible most of the time.

p2481
aVI can understand that, it wasn't really their finest hour to be honest..
p2482
aVThe interesting thing about this song is that it could be considered a pseudo-cover if not a full cover.\u000a\u000aIt was originally written and composed by Tony for Ari Koivunen and his debut album Fuel for the Fire, after he won the third season of Idols Finland (back when Idols could actually get you a singing career. His co-finalist Anna Abreu continues to make music as well, as does Antti Tuisku, the third place of the first season. Some other top-level contestants also continue making music)\u000a\u000aIt really shows that it was really written for Ari, as it sounds superior to most people when performed by him.

VI love Gyze, but they're not "blackened". Melodeath is good enough to describe them. It just so happens that Japanese melodeath tends to be very power metal-y in nature.

VAight, let's do this.\u000a\u000a**Exlibris**: This is all right. Pretty decent instrumental parts, and a pretty sweet *violin*(!) segment by some dude called Wodecki. The vocalist is pretty good, too. I can't get myself to care about this particular song, though, but that's just me.  \u000a**Reasons Behind**: This could have been a decent song, if the voice didn't want me to stick forks in my ears. I'm exaggerating a little, but only a little. Musical part is all right, nothing spectacular and not melodic enough to be called melodic (imo). Drums are probably the best part. Maybe I'm extra picky today, but there's a difference between singing and *whining*.  \u000a**Alltheniko**: I like speed metal, and these guys have got an all right, generic speed metal sound going. The solo is pretty cool and all. My only complaint is that this song would have been better as an instrumental only song, because holy shit shut the fuck up, dude. I'm so picky I'm about to burst, but really, the guy sounds like my grandma using a really, really poor quality mic.  \u000a**Kouzin Bedlam**: At least I like the voice in this one. Great progressive vibe, and while the guitars and drums have good execution, they mostly stay in the background. When the solo segment comes though, it's their time to shine. It's a really damn good solo segment, too. The vocals are good, catchy and uplifting.  \u000a**Messiah's Kiss**: This is power metal mixed with old-school hard-rock style singing. A little generic, perhaps, for the power metal crowd, but chances are you'll get a kick out of this if you like AC/DC and stuff.  \u000a**Renegade**: This stuff's pretty cool. I can't really find that much to say about it, except that I don't hate it. And that says *alot*.  \u000a**Space Vacation**: Awdamn, there's only a 30 second teaser for this. It sounds really promising, it would probably be my favorite of this week. But I can't really know for sure.  \u000a**Wretch**: A track-by-track preview. From what I hear, the vocalist is average but the instrumental part more than makes up for it. Doesn't sound like something I'd personally get into, but it's definitely worth a checking out if you're not as picky as me :P  \u000a**Blodwen**: In the beginning of the track, it sounds like they're trying to emulate Nightwish in the Tarja era. Then the verse begins and  I think the appropriate thing to do is cringe a little and close the video. I sat through it for your sake, to warn you of the imminent bleeding ears you'll get from this.  \u000a**Stilverlight**: A pretty folky guitar riff in this one. Can't get myself to care about the rest of the song. The best parts are definitely then they pull out that guitar and get some riffs going. There's some keyboard here and there, too. Hey, another song better off as instrumental-only. It's just raining boring/bad vocals this week, huh?  \u000a**Kolony**: Wowow. The intro segment is deliciously melodic, powerful and intense. The vocal style somehow gives me a viking metal vibe, is that just me? A pretty catchy and awe-inspiring song, I'm curious about the rest of their work.\u000a\u000aAight. Kinda mediocre week. My recommendations for this week would be Kouzin Bedlam, and the Kolony release from a couple of weeks back sounds very intereseting.
p2560
aVOf interest, this Exlibris song just appeared on my youtube subscriptions, and i think it's a lot better than the preview song shared here (like a loooooooot better):\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAKQWeQ6NSM
p2561
aVI know in an earlier comment you said you don't like harsh vocals and prefer uplifting and happier melodies like those of RoF, but how do you feel about songs where the two are mixed? Here are some Rhapsody of Fire songs where they do just that:\u000a\u000a[Reign of Terror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aItNg5SDX9Q)  \u000a[Aeons of Raging Darkness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta_KhUa3O7Q)  \u000a[Tornado](https://soundcloud.com/nuclearblastrecords/rhapsody-of-fire-tornado) (Soundcloud link)
p2562
aVI'm actually pretty fond of the song Reign of Terror. I'm generally open for songs mixing clean and unclean vocals, but for me to take a liking to them, the unclean vocals have to make sense with the rest of the song, rather than being put there for the sake of having unclean vocals (which seems like kind of a trend). Know what I mean? Checked out Aeons of Raging Darkness and Tornado, and they're both decent. As long as the clean-to-unclean ratio is large enough, and it fits with the song, I don't mind. I just can't get into subgenres where the unclean vocals are the main thing. So that's why I always skip anything related to death / black metal.\u000a\u000aI remember saying Sabaton was the closest I'd get to unclean vocals, even though the guy just sings in a lower register and rarely actually growls. But now that I think about it, I actually used to listen to Bullet for my Valentine, which also mixes clean and unclean vocals. The most screamy song of theirs that I like would be [Ashes of the Innocent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urS5DDNE9Jw). It's the chorus and guitar solo that I like, but they're great enough that I don't really mind the screamed verses.  
p2563
aVAlso noting after I listened to it again that that specific Kolony song is about a guy's father dying (and the theme of what sort of legacy each person leaves behind), and the lyrics are pretty damn good. (Actually giving me the feels) Now I like it even more.
p2564
aVThat's cool, not a very common lyrical theme. Reminds me of [Amorphis - Silent Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb2gjwq1WXg), which is about the opposite - a father outliving his son. I've neither lost a father nor a son, but still gives me the feels.

aVHey guys, I totally forgot what time of week it was, and almost missed this completely! Wouldn't have been a smart thing, seeing as how I will be on holidays for the next three weeks and won't be able to do my opinions for those ones (I'll just post an opinions megathread when I get back or something).\u000a\u000aIn other news, a word of warning for all you headphone users out there - wearing tightly/snuggly fitting headphones too long can lead to you starting to go bald in the areas where the headphones come in contact with your head. Why do I know this? ... No Reason... This will also be me making up an excuse about why things sound different this week - I'll be listening through my laptop speakers (which are bass boosted) instead of my headphones to try and preserve the hair that I still have lef-UM SHIT I MEAN NEVERMIND.\u000a\u000aMy opinions (based upon previews only):\u000a\u000a- **Exlibris:** Holy *fuck* that violin. I need a minute. Seriously, Strings - best instruments. The vocals are decent, they fit the song perfectly, and the instrumentation is pretty great (ignoring the solo for now), they had a great riff, and they had an almost Folk Metal level of dancey drive to the tune. That Violin solo was the highlight of this song though; that was such a unique and interesting thing, I've never heard a band actually do the Metal Distortion to their non-guitar instruments. No matter what song that had been put with, overall I would of probably liked it.\u000a\u000a- **Reasons Behind:** I have too agree with /u/fazermint on this one - the instrumentation is freaking sweet, but those vocals kill it. Normally I really like female vocalists because they diffuse the harshness of the music really well, but this... She just sounds *awful*; too light and Operatic, and completely at odds with the instruments.\u000a\u000a- **Alltheniko:** I really like this one - they have a very GarageBand style to their music; the vocals don't have high production value, but still carry well, the instrumentation has the same rough style to the production value, and helps make everything feel like it belongs together. Overall, I like this song quite a bit (this might just be my laptop speakers hiding the problems though).\u000a\u000a- **Kouzin Bedlam:** I really like the instrumentation for this one; the keyboard helps to diffuse the heaviness of the drums and guitar, and leaves us with a brilliant amount of heaviness and drive. The guitars themselves are glorious, and the drums set a great beat. The vocals are pretty good, not too harsh, not too soft, just right. Overall, this was a pretty great song.\u000a\u000a- **Messiah's Kiss:** I don't think there is anything I can really say about this that /u/Fazermint hasn't already covered. Hell, he even used the same band I was going to use. The instrumentation is a great mix of Pub Rock and Metal, and the vocals are very punchy and fun. Overall, a bloody great song.\u000a\u000a- **Mors Principum Est:** So, I'm 50/50 on this song. The instrumentation is bloody sick outside of the sung sections, and has a brilliantly fast and heavy level. During the singing sections a lot of the awesomeness is bled out of the song, which is disappointing, but they are still reasonably good. The vocals are... ok...? They probably sound better through headphones, but they sound like they are a little at odds with the heaviness and roughness of the instrumentation. As time went on, I warmed up to the mix of the two, but it was a little jarring to begin with. Overall, pretty decent if you can ignore the small problems I have with it.\u000a\u000a- **Space Vacation:** Sweet instrumentation, weak vocals. Oh wait, this was 29 seconds long, so this opinion is already going to take longer to read than it will to listen to the preview. At least the JPower bands give us 1'30" to listen to.\u000a\u000a- **Wretch:** God damn there's something for bloody *everyone* in this album it seems. The first preview was very driven, and had a great dancey vibe to it. The second was pretty damn sweet, the third had a brilliant focus on the bass, and bogan Pub Rock backing singers. The fourth rounded everything out well with a slower song. Overall, while I would have preferred them giving everything to us, I am happy with what I heard.\u000a\u000aAnd the stuff I missed last week:\u000a\u000a- **Blodwen:** ... Wow... No way to save this song. The instrumentation was very textbook, but could have been decent. But those vocals were just rubbish. They sounded like a female Kamijo trying to sing Operatic English, and it just *doesn't work*. A little higher baseline on her voice and things might have worked out, because at sections where she sings higher, she breaks out of the whole "shitty singer" and has some decent vocals in there. Seriously, that section at around 3'20" where she sings softly and highly was positively acceptable, and what does she do? Go back to the rubbish style. Overall, not really worth the listen.\u000a\u000a- **Stilverlight:** Got to agree with /u/Fazermint again; the instrumentation are fucking great, but the vocals and lyrics are rubbish. Would have sounded less awkward in their native language, and considering how good the harsher parts of the vocals sound, would have turned this from shit to gold. Those instrumental sections are fucking glorious though, which is unfortunate.\u000a\u000a- **Kolony:** *Fuck*. *Yes*. This was fucking glorious. The instrumentation was a perfect mix of heavy and fast, and the vocals were harsh and were very Punk Rock in style, adding a really nice undertone to the song. This was fucking great, I am enjoying this so hard.\u000a\u000aAs for /u/SinuataBouquet's highlight:\u000a\u000a- **Cyntia -  \u9583\u5149\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9:** God damn I love that instrumentation... And those Vocals... Well fuck me everything is good with this one. The instruments are very fast and light, and mix perfectly with the vocals. The Vocals are great, and the song is sung at the right pitch to mesh well with the instrumentation, which is actually not that common for JPower bands, surprisingly. I would have liked the Highlight to be of the whole song, but Japanese bands and their minute thirty bullshit I guess. Oh well, for what we got, it sounds freaking sweet. Thanks for this /u/SinuataBouquet!\u000a\u000aWell, that's that I guess. I'll see if I can squeeze in the time to do next weeks opinion, but if I don't I'll see you all around Christmas! Have a good one!\u000a\u000aEdit: Oh Right the Highlight...

I can't find any anime credits to their name, perhaps visual novels / other games?\u000a\u000aYes, I was referring to visual novels (specifically Black Cyc's series), but I figured more people would know what manga is than a Japanese visual novel/hentai.

aVI can totally understand that. I was never too big of a fan I just dabbled in them a little bit when I was really into the Gothemburg scene melodeath stuff.

I actually just bought those two today, after visiting a record store that has foreign metal albums. They only had the two, plus a couple of live albums which I don't care for. Had they more, I probably would have bought them as well.

Also, Ian Gillan gives one of, if not the best vocal performances ever on this song.

aVI absolutely dig speed-based guitar solos, but the ones that leave a lasting impression on me are generally slower, more emotionally charged solos.\u000a\u000a* [Symphony X - When All is Lost (6:29 - 8:03)](http://youtu.be/mPVC2UJRAbc?t=6m27s)  \u000a* [Iron Maiden - The Longest Day (4:29 - 6:38)](http://youtu.be/JDCgvcH301A?t=4m29s)  \u000a* [Alter Bridge - Blackbird (4:36 - 5:54)](http://youtu.be/yz_j7nVCJJ0?t=4m36s)

p2713
aVSometimes, Dragon Force sounds like it's a parody of itself. Just a little bit too over the top. 
p2714
aVmy favorite Dragonforce song!
p2715
aV[Iron Fire's March of the Immortals](http://youtu.be/4GrI2ym2oU4?t=2m35s) has a really short solo, less than 30 seconds or so, but it's become one of my favorites simply because it fits the song so well. I'm always looking forward to it throughout the song, and the drummer adds a ton of great energy to it. 
p2716
aVYou know, you can put more than one line in a comment.
p2717

p2778
(lp2779
V[Dark Forest - The awakening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hQsKSoA1bQ) - Pretty amazing album in my opinion, They somehow manage to fuse heavy/power metal with some folklorish and Celtic/Medieval elements and make it work really well. All songs are awesome and very well done and rich. The vocals fit perfectly and everything is just stellar. By far, one of the most overlooked albums of this year.\u000a\u000a[Spellcaster - Spellcaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhWJXbNausg) - Very interesting album with an amazing variety of riffs going on, awesome drumming and vocals. Maybe it fits more in the speed/heavy metal genre but hey, i think it's a pretty powerful album.\u000a\u000a[Noble Beast - Noble Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPRDE17-xIQ) - If i ever make a top 10 metal albums of 2014, this one will be in the top 3 guaranteed. Near perfect album and i don't think people fully acknowledge how hard it is to make an album of this caliber. A power metal album (imo, one of the most stale genres of metal) released in 2014, 60+ minute length, done by 20+ year old guys, DEBUT album, and it's pretty much perfect, musically and production wise. WTF! Now access your brain and try to remember the last time an album that checked all of these ticks. You can't! because there hasn't been a band that released an album so long and at the same time so good and consistent.\u000a\u000aAnyway, this is my opnion on the matter. Noble Beast isn't as obscure as the other two, but it still slipped past by a lot of good people i know.
p2780
aVJesus man, you really need to get out of my head.  As soon as I read the topic my first thought was Dark Forest.  A brilliant album(In my top 5 this year) and I haven't heard a single person mention it.  Then you go and mention Noble Beast, which happens to be my albums of the year. I'm tempted to say this is the best debut since Lost Horizon for me.  This album is insanely good. 
p2781
aVIt might not be very obscure since it was covered in the weekly releases thread, but I was really fascinated with Divine Ascension's album *Liberator*. Just a really fresh sound with a female vocalist that didn't opt for the (arguably overused) soprano style. \u000a\u000aMy favorite track on the album is [Stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7_frbp6bi8), without a doubt. [Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWqHmZFLQ3U) is another great track.\u000a\u000aThe rest of the album isn't stellar, but overall a very nice production. Worth checking out, in any case.
p2782
aVI cannot agree more with this\u000a\u000aI came across them about 2 weeks ago, and i have been listening to the album ever since, its a fantastic prog/power album\u000a\u000aMy pick however, is Mago de Oz (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyrKYVo3GY0)\u000aIn my opinion, one of the best folk/power albums of the year
p2783
aVI think this is extremely boring but the folklore is good, and boy do i love me some folky folklore
p2784
aVI like the second one more. This could grow on me. 
p2785
aV&gt; It might not be very obscure since it was covered in the weekly releases thread\u000a\u000aEverything gets covered there anyway. I haven't heard of this album though, and it definitely sounds pretty good from the two songs you linked. Now to see if it can be better than MindMaze's album, since their styles seem to be so similar.
p2786
aVI wasn't aware Divine Ascension released a second album, so this was a pleasant surprise for me! The tracks you linked are pretty solid, will have to check the album out.
p2787
aV[Neofly's Strangers in Paradise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmiMP8zwyKs)\u000a\u000aMelodic power metal with a streak of symphonic in there. Great vocalist and uplifting songs.

aVI've posted these a lot, but these ones come to mind, cause they aren't exactly super popular bands, but their albums are pretty high quality:\u000a\u000a[Elderoth - Mystic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnY_cRkcnCw&amp;list=PLRXOdSSY3he7v1FgX87UXf4Xt4wafKoD7)\u000a\u000a[Viathyn - Cynosure](https://soundcloud.com/viathyn/sets/cynosure)\u000a\u000a[Kolony - Sledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fywLXF2yJmI)\u000a\u000a[Sequester - Missing Image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufJTAzAPDBo)\u000a\u000a[Primalfrost - Prosperous Visions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgGSC9YG7Tc)\u000a
p2790
aVDynasty - Renatus. Just listen to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty6WNPv5pu8). 
p2791
aVAnd don't blink. :O
p2792
aVDefinitely top 5 for me.
p2793
aVMight as well include mine to get some more comments going here.\u000a\u000aI absolutely insist everyone listen to Skyliner's debut album, *Outsiders*. One of the catchiest and most memorable songs from the album is "[Forever Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9SOCeLI9vY)", but it's a bit deceiving. You might think it's just a normal USPM album with some European influence, but the rest of the album has some incredible experimentation with black metal, death metal, and progressive metal thrown in. It's honestly the freshest thing I've heard from a power metal album in a long time. If you're looking for good starting points, though, the aforementioned song and "[Symphony in Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVohphX3jug)" should get you hooked.
p2794
aVWent in expecting "Forever Young" to be a cover, [like Pathfinder did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlLIfF8KUbI). Pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a cover at all.
p2795
aVI really like the Sonata album, but there were too many missteps. I guess it's still [Noble Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wh4rtJl5OY) for me, a late and very welcome entry. 
p2796
aV[Edge of Thorns- Insomnia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3yd1k17JGU)- Awesome guitar driven power metal\u000a\u000a[Adamantra: Act II: Silent Narratives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e756WPVJoDQ)- Quality power/prog with heavy keyboard elements. \u000a\u000a
p2797
aVI forgot about Adamantra, solid album with a great opening track. The very last part of the album always makes me need to listen to Lionheart again. 
p2798
aVFun fact: The intro of "Lionheart" is the continuation of the previous album's ending track "Ungiven".
p2799
aVNot sure if it counts as overlooked but for me, it would be Project Arcadia's "A time of changes" , my favourite tracks off it being [Formidable foe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPwjXPTZG3o) and [I'm Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiNN5xPcMpE)

aV[deleted]
p2801
aVDawn Of Destiny - F.E.A.R [End This Nightmare] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMnb3GXeITU) 0:43 sort of ruins the album, but at least it's a chick saying it.\u000aI've listened to Stamina's Perseverance and Noturnall's self titled album a fair bit too.\u000aBy the sound of things I need to check out Noble Beast.
p2802

p2803
aVI know right, I make sure I talk loudly while that shit happens if I'm with other people.
p2804
aVlmao\u000a\u000aDo you like most of the album? Vocal delivery is a bit off for me.
p2805
aV[A Sound of Thunder - The Lesser Key of Solomon](http://asot.bandcamp.com/album/the-lesser-key-of-solomon). Really solid all around but Nina Osegueda just kills it on vocals. Also, Udoroth has a [fucking awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetRJ9aAyvc) especially for such a little-known band.
p2806
aVI thought QuantumX by Celestial Decay was pretty solid, but also may feel a bit overlong to some. I find that describes a lot of albums I enjoy...\u000a\u000a[They don't have much of an online presence.](https://www.google.com/search?q=quantumx&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8#q=QuantumX+by+Celestial+Decay) 
p2807
aVnot sure how popular this is but Opera Magna's EP for holy shit over the top symphonic power metal
p2808
aV[Ten - Albion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOyfWEVnixA)\u000a\u000aMy favorite band of all time have hit back hard with this new album, 2 new guitarists and some really great tunes. Vocals for fans of Falconer! Music for fans of the heavier side of Magnum.\u000a\u000a[Arion - Last Of Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVJpD_ntNBw)\u000a\u000aThis album completely blew me away, these guys are so young and producing such stellar material. I really look forward to seeing these guys as they progress.\u000a\u000a[Dynazty - Renatus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-0nJpurn-0)\u000a\u000aEasily my most played album of the year, such kick-ass powerful catchy material. Can't wait for a follow-up in this style.
p2809
aVHoly shit, thank you for the Dynazty album. This is fantastic.\u000a\u000a(The other two are equally fantastic, but I was already aware - I've been a fan of Ten for years, and I lucked upon Arion';s debut not long ago through that very YT channel!)

p2815
(lp2816
VThis is the greatest song in all of Metal.
p2817
aVStargazer is the best metal song ever written. 
p2818
aVI assume you're talking about the Ronnie James Dio (RIP) - Ritchie Blackmore - Rainbow [Stargazer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVXy1OhaERY)?
p2819
aVRIP DIO but I actually prefer the Dream Theater cover of it. 
p2820
aVWell, I respect your opinion on the matter, but I find it really hard to give anyone the edge over Dio when singing original material. I've heard the Dream Theater cover of it, and I like LaBrie, but, to put it bluntly, it's fucking Dio.\u000a\u000aHe has the best voice in all of metal. He's probably second to Freddie Mercury as having the best voice of all-time, compared to peers in their respective genres.\u000a\u000a[Link to the Dream Theater cover for anyone interested.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCaI1eEQnfc) (Sorry I can't find a higher quality version of it on YouTube.)
p2821
aVNever heard the Dream Theater version, it's shit in comparison to the original.
p2822
aV100% agree with you, any other song just pales in comparison. Gonna play the record right now.
p2823
aVI've never encountered another song that builds so perfectly.  How they pummel you with that driving beat for the whole song and then that climax hits and they slip in that live orchestra as icing on the cake. God damn.  I get chills just talking about it.  \u000a\u000aThe only song that comes close for me is Hallowed By Thy Name.  Specifically the Beast Over Hammersmith recording.  I've said this many times, Iron Maiden was absolutely flawless that night. 
p2824
aVNormally I downvote Blind Guardian here (even though I love them) because they're the quintessential power metal band and everyone knows them and I don't see the point in posting their material other than a silly karma grab.\u000a\u000aBut this song? Can't do it. Have an upvote.
p2825
aVGreat song, never heard it before and I love it.
p2826
aVRead the first part of the title, thought Blind Guardian was covering RUSH songs, was kinda confused but really happy, kept reading, was a bit disappointed.\u000a\u000aGreat song, though.
p2827
aVTime stand still is my favorite Rush song and has my favorite lyrics of any song. \u000a\u000aI'm not looking back\u000a\u000aBut I want to look around me now
p2828
aVTime Stands Still makes me feel old and I'm not that old yet. I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about that, but I keep listening.
p2829

p2833
aVResponding to legitimate criticisms by calling them childish is, well, childish. Cya.
p2834
aVHonestly though the members are like 4% of the reason I left. \u000a\u000aIt's more that I continue to not do shit that I should have been doing. Eventually I just had to sit down and recognise that I was no longer suited for the position. 
p2835
aV[deleted]
p2836
aVWhy?  I see no reason for you to be done.  We now have multiple moderators, all of whom are active.  It has not been bad around here either; just inactive on the moderator side.  If you love power metal, stay!  No more drama about leaving and such.  Just stay.  Post when 'ya can.  Lurk around.\u000a\u000aI see no good reason for you to leave at this point.  If I can't convince you and you are going to leave anyways, then I at least want to thank you for all of the hard work you have put in.  You've been a huge contributing member to this subreddit.

aV[MFW](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-13719-Don-t-go-where-I-can-t-follow-MIeX.gif).\u000a\u000aI've been appreciating the hell out of your efforts in posting weekly threads. I've been getting into some heated arguments with many people here, but I don't think you're one of them.\u000a\u000aIdeally I'd have you stay and keep writing weekly release threads. Because I love 'em. If you do end up leaving, I'd be okay with doing them myself.
p2839
aVJust out of morbid curiosity and obviously you don't need to even answer or acknowledge me. Why do you want to leave?\u000a\u000aBtw, your work on this sub is always positive regardless of opinions.
p2840
aVWhat legitimate criticisms???? There is no need for moderation dumbass, its a small music sub. The sub looks fine, there's no spam or unrelated posts.. The only problem is you people constantly bitching and being over dramatic. The unlostHorizon guy is the worst about it
p2841
aVUnlosthorizon's weekly "The sky is falling!" posts were always amusing. 
p2842
aVYou, sir, have diarrhea of the keyboard.
p2843
aVThat doesn't look like a legit criticism 
p2844
aV:(\u000a\u000aI think the the only moderation I've missed lately is mostly mechanical stuff: sticky the new weekly release thread, unsticky the old one, post the vote, etc.\u000a\u000a(I was tempted to just go ahead and put together a voting page myself, but I had no idea if I'd be duplicating effort, or if it would fall off the front page in a day.)\u000a\u000aWhile I get as tired of some of the comments as anyone else, I don't think I've seen any that deserve to be deleted. I'd rather have a community than some thing sterile and unwilling to tolerate people having personalities.
p2845
aVHere is the reality of the situation, guys.\u000a\u000aWe've got a fairly small subreddit.  There are aspects about it which are nice, such as being our own little community, needing few rules, etc..  But the reality is, new people are going to be coming along, and we will be growing; so long as power metal is being released.\u000a\u000aSo I hope to find some sort of middle ground here.  The moderating that needs to be done in terms of negative users, posts, and comments is few and far between.  But that does not mean it should not be done.  I suppose I cannot speak for all of you, but I would like new members to be joining.  The more we grow, the better.  And the nice thing is, I do not believe we will ever grow enough to become a subreddit where there is no community, and no one is recognized.\u000a\u000aBut we will grow.  And there have been times where I feel if someone wanted to come check out this community and see if it is right for them, they would have looked at some of the posts and comments and thought "nope".  There is proof of this in some users within our community. This is true for every subreddit, not just us.  But that does not mean we should not strive to eliminate that.  Not much work needs to be done, though, and that is really nice.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, there are some people who, to put frankly, have multiple sticks up their asses.  Some people who take things way too seriously, who get hurt by trolly comments.  You are who you are, and I understand that, but I strongly suggest trying to harden yourself a little; we're a community and we'll joke around and poke fun at each other, try not to take it too personally.  It is going to continue, and that is the nature of some people.  They do not mean any harm by it.\u000a\u000aAnyways, I hope to have found some middle-ground between those who are upset at what has happened, and those who are upset at the people who are upset.  Is it as serious as some people make it out to be?  No.  But are there legitimate concerns?  Yes; especially if we want to continue to grow.

p2863
aV&gt; Great production values\u000a\u000aSounds like every other overloaded modern metal band. \u000a
p2864
aVI wasn't talking so much about their actual mixing as the quality of the recording.   Most of the time when you have a band full of teenagers, metal or not, their recordings usually sound like the product of a bunch of teenagers recording in someone's garage. \u000a\u000aThat track sounds like someone mixed it in a studio.  LIve, you can see they're still somewhat unsophisticated, but there's some definite talent there.

aVI usually check out BG songs that are posted, but none have interested me. Until now. *NOW* I see what the hype is about, this is a sick track. Sigh, I might have to get into BG after all. x]
p2919
aVHow can someone be into Power Metal and at the same time not into Blind Guardian?.. I cannot compute such logic.\u000a\u000aThis song is textbook BG but it's amazing nonetheless.
p2920
aVMuch in the same way that I find Lost Horizon and Pathfinder average, despite them getting lorded around as the best bands ever.\u000a\u000aI could always see the appeal of BG, but everything I've heard earlier was, by far, not living up to the hype. And you know me, vocal style is crucial. I'm still not a huge fan, but this track is so damn impressing musically.\u000a\u000aWould you hit me up with some other BG tracks like this?
p2921
aVThis is the first time BG are impressing you musically?  What BG songs have you heard
p2922
aVI don't remember any of the song titles, I'm afraid
p2923
aVOk, we'll start your journey at the album where Blind Guardian became Blind Guardian, Somewhere Far Beyond. \u000a\u000a[Time What Is Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0fV5KF80_Q) is the same style as the new song, Face-destroying opening riff and a absolutely classic chorus. \u000a\u000aNext we have Imaginations from the Otherside, which to no surprise seems like it will be the closest thing to the new album stylistically.  You really can't go wrong with any of the songs on this album, but if you want something that grabs you right away, give\u000a\u000a [the Script for My Requiem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZznRuOKQqQ) a listen. \u000a\u000aFollowing that is their Magnum Opus, Nightfall in Middle Earth, again, near perfect album, like the last two.  Any song is fucking brilliant, but I'm going to suggest starting with \u000a\u000a[Time Stands Still (At the Iron Hill)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRdBwXslqbA). At this point you want a good sound system or headphones, a lot of shit going on, so you want to get the full experience. If your speakers aren't picking up this floor tom hits during the chorus you are missing out. \u000a\u000aWe'll have you skip the next two albums for now and go right to [A Voice in the Dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE40BA7Oxb0) from At the Edge of Time.\u000a\u000aOk, so if those songs I linked pique your interest give the full albums a listen.  From there move on to the 5 albums I didn't list at your own leisure The first three are still solid albums, but they don't capture the aura of BG.  A Twist in the Myth and A Night at the Opera(Except for And then there was silence) are merely mediocre albums at best and I would save those for last. 
p2924
aVI love your write-up, but then you had to go and kill my boner with your trashing ANatO at the end! How can we agree on everything else, yet come to such differing conclusions about the same album?!?
p2925
aVTo offer an opposing view, I think the albums /u/mushmancat deems to be mediocre are fantastic as well.\u000a\u000aThe only issue with A Twist in the Myth for me is its awful production, which sterilizes everything and makes Hansi sound almost like a robot at times. I hope it gets a much needed remix/remaster sometime soon...\u000a\u000aA Night at the Opera is only slightly less perfect than Nightfall in Middle-earth, but still perfect.
p2926
aVHey! You seem to know a few things about the names of instruments! I have a question regarding Time Stands Still (At the Iron Hill), during the chorus "...the fate of us all," there is this very faint sound, almost sound like a string instrument of some kind, could that possibly be some sort of harp, or am I way off in that assumption?\u000a\u000aEdit: It can be heard the best in the last chorus.
p2927
aVwell, my knowledge about instruments is pretty basic.  If I had to venture a guess I would say either a harp or a lute though.
p2928
aVNot more basic than mine! That's for sure :)\u000a\u000aThanks for your input!
p2929
aVThanks for the walkthrough, mate. Really warming up to BG now!\u000a\u000aTime What is Time and A Voice in the Dark are pretty damn good. I'll probably end up going through the albums from newest to oldest... that's what I'm doing with Dragonland right now

aVSure, you can try the following:\u000a\u000a[A voice in the dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZNb96EQJ8)\u000a[Ride into obsession](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WXeHT661xM)\u000a[Battlefield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xIe1tPtyAk)\u000a[And the story ends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCETXxCkyUk)\u000a\u000aI'd say those would be something along the lines of the new track.
p2931
aVThanks, mate! Well, I'm a fool for not taking the time to get acquainted with BG.\u000a\u000aOut of those tracks, I liked A Voice in the Dark the most
p2932
aVFucking hell, the omission of the "you're trapped in my mind" bit from the first clip confused the hell out of me...
p2933
aVI'm one of those people. I can't get into anything past the first three albums and *A Night at the Opera*. I'm still indifferent towards this song too. 
p2934
aVSo you're saying you like the first three albums and "A Night at the Opera"?\u000a\u000aBG have 3 albums that i don't like and one that i thought was really bad, i'm still a huge fan of BG and will continue to be regardless of the quality of their latest output. I'm a huge Sabaton fan but i really only loved "Carolus Rex", everything else is in my opinion a bunch of bad songs with some really fun songs.
p2935
aVYeah, those four albums are the only things I like from BG. I've found everything else to be a bit boring.
p2936

aVOh shit, it's here. Fuck, it's good. I'm so goddamn excited for the album. This has a very similar sound to something off At the Edge of Time.

aVGot chills right when the chorus started.  I've now listened two more times and the chills are still there.\u000a\u000aJesus, when I think about if I had never found Blind Guardian...  Nightmare.
p2939
aVOkay, so I am completely clueless when it comes to music so I can't speak in those terms, but why does this seem so damn muffled?\u000a\u000aThe melody is okay, but it just doesn't sound that crisp to me. It is like listening to a low bitrate track you downloaded from kazaa, back in the year 2001 or something.
p2940
aVThis is an unofficial source - it's probably a low quality rip or something. The teasers they released sounded much better, and having something better than youtube streaming will be the real test of how good the production sounds.
p2941
aVYeah, now when you mention it. The single isn't supposed to be released until the 5th/6th, right?

asVFazermint's favorite Power Metal releases: February
p3000
(lp3001
VWinterage is ambitious yet low-budget and I think what they've achieved deserves a big round of applause. Really enjoyable symphonic power metal. Good on them their passion shows.
p3002
aVJust curious, how many times did you listen to these albums before reaching a verdict on their score? \u000a\u000aI've only listened to Tanagra out of these albums, and I agree with your assessment of it. Thought "Tyranny of Time" was really good while the rest was forgettable. "The Undying Light" was at first with the forgettable group but after couple more listens it has become... less forgettable. But I'm going to give the album another go to see if it turns out any better. \u000a\u000aI'm surprised by your perfect score for Wind Rose. While I liked the promotional song, it didn't quite sell me on the album. However I listened to "The Breed of Durin" due to this thread and I thought it was much better. So, I'm definitely going to check out the album someday soon. Winterage too. 
p3003
aVHm, I think I end up listening at least 3 times to an album. Also, I wouldn't take my scores overly serious. Wind Rose is the best album I've heard this year, hence the 10/10. Perhaps a tad generous, idk. I think I tend to be generous rather than strict with the scores (maybe to compensate for the dismissive nature of my band writeups). In any case, the album is amazing.

p3013
aVPower / Death combo?
p3014
aVThey're usually considered Power / Thrash, although they do throw in growls every now and then for kicks. But primarily, I think that the death elements aren't so prevalent as to label them that.
p3015
aVThey're definitely unique and I want to listen to them more, it must have been the blast beats, trem picking, and growls that reminded me of death metal. 
p3016

p3028
(lp3029
VI have so much time on my hands let's be produtive and avoid the usage of punctuation to convey biased opinions on a fresh form of art GO (exclamation point)\u000a\u000a13 fucking songs, 70 minutes. I'm writing this sentence before even listening to the album and I would bet all of my man marbles (the whole two of them) that it's too fucking long. Probably another case of Metallica-itis.\u000a\u000a**Ouverture in do minore** - Whoever delivers the violins definitely did a good job but that's about it, it's very one dimensional and bland and some instruments just seem out of key even if it appears intentional, it's almost as if they're tuning the instruments (If that's the purpose of the intro, I clap). In the end, it serves no purpose other than to check the list of symphonic power metal rules. Also, "Ouverture"? Does this have any meaning or is it really a typo.\u000a\u000a**The Harmonic Passage** - The true album opener and a very good song at that, possibly because it resembles Rhapsody of Fire so much but hey, it works. This song is a bit too long, a lot of doodlery and diddlery in the middle that could have been cut.\u000a\u000a**The Flame Shall Not Fade** - Text-book slower song following fast song. It's not that bad, It's okay. the parts towards the end are pretty good.\u000a\u000a**Wirewings** - Boy can this guy hit some fucking high notes. Good fun song but the vocalist abuses a little bit too much and attempts to shatter the windows in my house. It's important to note that I haven't heard any significant guitar work other than some average solos, everything is being delivered by the symphonic instruments. I'm starting to think that they actually aimed for a fully violin driven album.\u000a\u000a**Son of Winter** - Obligatory ballad. Not a bad one, it does get more interesting towards the end, almost as if they are breaking the monotony that is the first half of the song. The female vocals are superb.\u000a\u000a**La caccia di Tùrin** - Interludery.\u000a\u000a**Golden Worm** - What a start! Even if the guitar sounds a little bit like the intro in the second song. This song is kinda of awesome in all aspects, all instruments contribute and elevate the song into a feast for the senses, different vocal tonality enhances the song even further. Six minutes of excellent symphonic power metal. Again, the guitar remains secondary to others (only shines in the beginning of the song) but I'm starting to feel that it doesn't harm the album at all.\u000a\u000a**Victory March** - This one is a bummer, it's an instrumental bit but just seems to fall flat, I expected to feel really pumped and ready to conquer the world but it just doesn't do it for me. The album would be better without this one.\u000a\u000a**La grotta di cristallo** - [Folkloric tune for the festivities](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/79/5d/42/795d42772ad7615162f4e60f7bd92b77.jpg)! Similar to the Rhapsody style but more folky and melodic and more metal in a sense. Rhapsody folk style could go all the way to the true nature of folkloric music, this one is metal sprinkled with folk elements. The song could be smaller as well.\u000a\u000a**Crown to the Crowds** - Energetic song. Rarely does it slow down, and it keeps driving forward delivering more and more. The tiny trumpet intro is quite fitting.\u000a\u000a**Panserbjørne** - This one has the guitar in focus which is something I was not expecting in the rest of the album. A very welcome change of pace. this one is similar to Golden Worm in variety, just a plethora of different instruments and this time with the occasional rough vocals. this one is also slower and held back but great nonetheless. the main vocalist can hit some crazy high notes but thankfully he only does it very occasionally and doesn't force it on the listener constantly (*cough* *cough* Pellek).\u000a\u000a**The Endless Well** - Bad slow intro, it does not set the mood for anything. This one gives me a sense of Déjà vu on some melodies and it's all a bit of a mess and awkward. Some parts are really cool but some other parts are just plain weird. this should not be fucking 5 minutes. It's basically a giant prelude for the final song. The last 45 seconds are pretty good.\u000a\u000a**Awakening** - This one is a sad ending to the album. I refuse to believe they meshed this shit together and thought it was a good idea. Yeah let's make a bunch of different melodies and segments, select some classical pieces and bundle everything together in a non-cohesive manner. Okay I get what you are going for, you want to make a diverse uniquely structured song with elements from different classical symphonies, concertos and sonatas, it's a cool idea and can wield excellent pieces of music but this is not the way to do it. This is just an incoherent mess of melodies, bridges and pretentious wankery that has no build-up and no sense of direction; which is stupid because they have proven in this very album, that they can write complex songs (listen to Golden Worm and Panserbjorne). Truly, one of the worst endings to an album I have heard in recent times.\u000a\u000aAll in all, pretty good stuff going on here aside the finale, the violin is such a relevant part of the album and it's done very tastefully, it definitely stands out as the mvp of the album. Everything else is pretty good, there aren't weak elements other than the [fucking bass](http://www.westcoastcouples.com/Largemouth_bass-600%20reverse.jpg) (might as well not even be there). The vocals are all very well done and add a very refreshing variety to the whole album. Anyone interested in symphonic power metal should give this a serious shot, I know I will be listening to it again even if the final song seriously annoys me.\u000a\u000aThis band has some serious potential.

p3036
aVI gave this a good go, so here's my zero fucks given track-by-track.\u000aAll are first time impressions except for the title track.\u000a\u000a## Enveloped in Smoke (Dead Night)\u000a\u000aThis is a great intro. It's a bit long for being an intro track, so I don't really know what to call it. It contains lots of spoken parts, so it still gives off the vibes of an intro track.\u000aAnyways, this is chill stuff, and the lyrics are pretty easily processed poetry, which I like, so thumbs up from me.\u000aI like the mood it sets.\u000a\u000a## The Grey Ballet\u000a\u000aThis wants to be pretty heavy, but the sound and theme of the album doesn't really allow it.\u000aI don't like all the directions PelleK is taking with his vocals in this, and the spoken parts feel out of place.\u000a\u000aPartially all right.\u000a\u000a## Tempest\u000a\u000aHey, there's some fast drum action going on here, I can work with this.\u000aI would call this power metal. I like how the orchestration is fluttering in the chorus - creates some feelings of disorientation.\u000aPelleK does a vocal solo at 2:42. Guess some of you should beware of this song.\u000a\u000a## Restless Butterfly\u000a\u000aStarts out as some kind of melody based piano ballad.\u000aGuitars are added after one fourth of the song, for some mandatory heaviness.\u000aThe solo is not that fun, and the stick afterwards is pretty forgettable too.\u000a\u000a## Dragonflight\u000a\u000aI like how this starts out. It settles down pretty quickly, but it keeps its cool.\u000aThese lyrics are metal as fuck. I love this kind of shit. Dragons, thunder and fire.\u000aThere are a few short bursts of double bass drums, it's fucking perfect.\u000a\u000aThe chorus is awesome. I mean, in reality kind of plain, but this gives me a cool feeling and that's what matters most to me.\u000a\u000aThe solo reminds me of my childhood when I listened to MIDI interpretations of the Secret of Mana soundtrack. Good times.\u000a\u000a## On The Lions' Back\u000a\u000aThe intro brings Ocean of Opportunity to mind for a while, and then merges with Gloryhammer's Magic Dragon and becomes pretty fucking nice. I feel like it flirts a bit with Final Fantasy VI's soundtrack too.\u000aRight, so this is an instrumental song. I wouldn't place it together with Hammerfall's masterpieces that are Something for the Ages and Raise the Hammer, but I have to say that it is pretty damn moody.\u000aIt's good.\u000a\u000a## Cloud Dancers\u000a\u000aOh, the title track. BRING THE DOWNVOTES, BITCHES!\u000aThis song reveals to you the key to how enjoy this album: leave your analytics at the door.\u000aWhat you should do is to totally embrace the fact that this stuff is pretty swingy.\u000aNot that too much happens in this song, but I think it would've been better off if it was even simpler. The chorus is chillout.\u000a\u000a## Carillon Canticle\u000a\u000aDidn't get that title at all first. Looked it up: it's pretty metal.\u000a\u000aSo this is some positive song, written like it was jambic poetry.\u000aI think I see what he is doing, but I kind of don't get it.\u000aGuess I'll have to give it a few more listens before I can fully appreciate this.\u000a\u000aAlso, I think there's a Nyan Cat reference in here at the end...\u000a\u000a## Battle Supreme\u000a\u000aAlright, so this is the second full-blown power metal song in this album I would say. It contains, like, most power metal elements.\u000aIt honors the musical theme of the album, but would probably have been better if it didn't. I could have used some standard power to finish this off.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aI liked this. If I could take only one track with me from this album, it would definitely be _On the Lions' Back_.\u000a
p3037
aVI feel like I've said this before. Anyways, I gave it a chance. *Ocean of Opportunity* wasn't too bad and PelleK's put out some great music in the past (as well as some crap stuff). *Cloud Dancers* was horrible. It's overly self-indulgent, the music isn't nearly as good as the previous two albums, and the songs themselves just aren't memorable or well-written.\u000a\u000aI don't like being too negative, especially on people who seem to genuinely love making music, but this is PelleK's worst album yet.

aVThanks! Luckily, we provide a handkerchief with the rest of the album to wipe up all the tears of joy :)

aVThis song was badass as fuck.  Vocals really stuck out.  I'd like to hear some highs.
p3062
aVA few other songs on the album ("Kill to Die" in particular) have some very high highs. Check out our song "Complete Control" from Plan of Attack for your high singing fix :-)
p3063
aVThanks. I definitely will.\u000a
p3064
aVThe video was a bit much, but the song was tight. Great vocals. Very clean, and 80's sounding. Where are you guys from?

asVShould we do a Power Metal March Madness Tournament?
p3067
(lp3068
VI like the concept, but Blind Guardian would inevitably win such a thing.\u000a\u000aWe could try best album of 2015 so far, then there's only a 90% chance Blind Guardian would win it.
p3069
aVBG in all 3 categories? lol "THATS HOW GOOD THEY ARE" 
p3070
aVIt all depends how the brackets work. If you do it like NCAA, a band like Blind Guardian (obviously a #1 seed) would cruise to the finals facing weaker competition, whereas a band like Dark Moor would face stiffer competition.\u000a\u000aAlthough, to make it easier (and actually get 64 entrants) we can do albums of bands, which would be more fun since some people have different opinions on albums of bands (Nightfall in Middle Earth is highly praised while Battlions of Fear is not)
p3071
aVNo lie....I honestly prefer Battalions of Fear. And its for the simple reason that there's not as many backing vocals in the choruses as there are in nightfall. I prefer to hear only one Hansi at a time... but going back to the subject, Albums&gt;Bands in general for brackets. 
p3072
aVI like it too for its simplicity and being more speedy and thrash like. I used it here as an example, so no hate.
p3073
aVAlbums is a good idea, as the style of bands also progresses over time. Allows people to vote specifically for what they like, and it's easier to compare albums than it is bands and entire discographies.
p3074
aVI think we could make this a weekly/monthly sort of thing. Obviously, we couldn't call it march madness, but still. Like, one month we could do what OP suggested. One month/week we could just vote on our favorite albums from X band (Blind Guardian first, obviously. Also excludes Nightfall ;D)
p3075
aVI'd be interested in seeing whether Blind Guardian or Sabaton would win.  I'd really like to see it though.
p3076
aVI think RoF would be up there too, though they don't technically exist any more.
p3077
aVeh, RoF would get stomped. They have popularity but not like BG or Sabaton.
p3078
aVI'm a huge BG fan myself. RoF would be a close second but you're probably right when you say they'd get stomped.
p3079
aVThis is a good idea simply because you paired up two bands I'm familiar with and whose material I enjoy, but don't know which one I prefer (Almah vs. Shaman). It would be interesting to see where loyalties fall in difficult situations like that.\u000a\u000aBut man, where's all the USPM? Got to add some Crimson Glory, Heir Apparent, Liege Lord, Manilla Road, Virgin Steele...
p3080
aVProbably put USPM in a separate category if we don't want it to get drowned...
p3081
aVPersonally, I am all over the USPM lately so my votes would likely be aimed in that direction more often than not.\u000a\u000aAlthough I do see your point, much as I could pretend otherwise my vote is only worth one point. The USPM stuff would probably get drowned out without it's own category.
p3082
aVit's not even that it's worse, it seems there's just more of non USPM around here (or in general as well)
p3083
aVYeah it's just less-widely known or maybe less widely appreciated? I certainly didn't know it was a thing until maybe a year ago and that's pushing it.
p3084
aVWe should keep popular albums and popular bands out. 
p3085
aVI'm thinking we could do this with a bunch of albums...\u000a\u000aand then use it to construct the new essentials list?\u000a\u000a(depends on what you think the purpose of the essentials list is. If it's the most popular stuff, this would obviously work. If it's more like "mastery of the genre" or whatever, popular vote might not be the best)
p3086
aVas long as I can DDOS the voting with votes until the one i want wins\u000a\u000ajks
p3087
aVWe'll be happy to run this - just a couple things:\u000a\u000a1) Bands or albums?\u000a\u000a2) How do we want the initial bands to be decided? And how many?
p3088
aVI'd say albums. People can spend a couple of hours listening and then vote, whereas bands are much harder to get a feel for.\u000a\u000aMaybe a rule like only 2-3 albums per band allowed, so smaller/ newer bands aren't at a disadvantage.

aVAnything written by Jim Steinman, specifically the two Meatloaf albums he wrote.

aVFor now we have listen to covers of "Holding Out for a Hero". But a power metal version of "I Would Do Anything for Love" would be awesome, with Jorn Lande on the vocals for example.

aVI would Do Anything for Love would be awesome, but the one I would really want to hear is Bat Out of Hell.  Tobias Sammet needs to do a cover of that song.  I would probably die.

p3113
(lp3114
VBest bonus track I've ever heard. I can't imagine the album without this.
p3115
aVAs someone who had the early leak, once they released the official album stream, it definitely stood out among the rest of the tracks.\u000a\u000aI know why they do it (it's discussed all the time), but I really hate all these "bonus tracks" bands release on different versions of albums.  All I want is your music - why won't you just give it all to me for one price?  Even as much as I love Blind Guardian, I don't know if I'd buy the same album twice for one extra song.
p3116
aVI'm not sure why it even is a bonus track. It's placed in the middle of the album and very much fits the concept of the album. They already have "Doom", which is much more suited as a bonus track.
p3117
aVNuclear Blast probably ordered that. [Not nearly as bad as what they did to Iconoclast, though.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconoclast_%28Symphony_X_album%29#Track_listing)

aVOh God, I remember reading about this back when I first heard Iconoclast - just like with Distant Memories, I couldn't imagine Iconoclast without Reign in Madness.\u000a\u000aWhat a bunch of clowns, especially with a band like SX where you *know* Michael Romeo laid out the tracks as he (the songwriter/composer/artist) saw fit.
p3119
aVI know, I know... A lot of Blind Guardian here lately, I just felt like this song deserved its own post.  Love that chorus.\u000a\u000aThe only song I haven't heard yet is Doom... hoping someone puts it on YouTube sooner or later.

aVAnyone here a Sacred Mind fan? It's a bit unorthodox, but I absolutely love it, my favourite song of the album.

aVI can't get over that band name. It just makes me think of gum. It's a personal issue: I know "strident" is an actual word.\u000a\u000aThat's a promising track. It kind of reminds me of Keldian minus the space-y themes and sound.

p3140
(lp3141
V&gt;This is the kind of shit where, if you have friends over and this pops up on the playlist, you have to explain that the intro is just weird.\u000a\u000aMaybe it's just confirmation bias or something, but this seems to becoming more common with power metal releases...\u000a\u000a&gt;It's the only one that resembles the Power Metal that I'm used to, in terms of structure. Other songs that I found enjoyable are "Prophecies", "At the Edge of Time", "Sacred Machine", and "Grand Parade".\u000a\u000aI'm sort of surprised that you left out [The Holy Grail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPTz7z04_OM#t=37m52s), which is easily the most traditional power metal song on the album and has a mindblowingly amazing chorus.\u000a\u000a
p3142
aVHave you heard Angra's other releases? Honestly Secret Garden isn't very good. Start with their first album and just go forward. Temple of Shadows is my personal favourite. 
p3143
aVNope, Secret Garden is my first. I checked out "Spread your Fire" that was posted a few days ago, brilliant song. I'll definitely be doing a discography walkthrough sooner or later.
p3144
aVYou're in for a treat. Hell I envy you because you get to experience them for the first time. 
p3145
aVYou really think BG has weak choruses?\u000a\u000aHave you heard Mirror Mirror?
p3146
aVWhen I listened to *Beyond the Red Mirror*, I often found it hard to distinguish between verse and chorus. Same with Mirror Mirror. Of course I can recognize it when I listen intently.\u000a\u000aAs I said, that wasn't a criticism, and I don't necessarily think the choruses are *weak*. Just, in my experience they don't soar above the verses. So I get the impression that BG sacrifices that certain "dynamicity" for other kinds of dynamicities.
p3147
aVI'd say they're pretty damn diverse.\u000a\u000aIt seems to me that the verses on many of their songs differ in structure/melody between the first and second etc. Which creates a much more complex and interesting structure, which I enjoy much more than a predictable verse/chorus/verse/chorus/solo/chorus
p3148
aVYou said Sacred Machine is one of your favourite songs from Beyond the Red Mirror which isn't actually a song from the album. Based off your other preferences I presume you mean Sacred Mind, which is one of my personal favourites, and not Miracle Machine, the one with all the piano.
p3149

p3151
aVI'm glad I'm not the only one who is enjoying Visigoth so much. Very good old-school stuff. I noticed you didn't mentioned Grand Magus has Visigoth's main influence, if you're interested in more of this stuff, Grand Magus has a lot of quality stuff too.
p3152
aVI like the intro to Evil Lies in Every Man... I think it is very well done and a bit chilling.  As for Blind Guardian, you should give A Twist in the Myth a shot.  It is more accessible and it remains my favorite Blind Guardian album.  Go from there; I had to start there to get into Blind Guardian.  It takes awhile to appreciate the nuances and complexity of their song writing.

p3162
aVWhat sort of venue is it?
p3163
aVI got into Edguy through this album. It's probably my favorite or tied with Rocket Ride.  Do me like a Caveman could have been such a good song without that horrible Title and Chorus. I know they aren't meant to be taken seriously but still, that song is ruined by those two things.
p3164
aVDo me like a caveman reminds me a lot of their album hellfire club. 
p3165
aVTo me, Edguy stopped being good / I stopped caring after Mysteria. 
p3166
aVI haven't been able to get into Edguy ever since I realised they were religious and sexist, and that it permeated all of their music since they quit making traditional power metal, like their older work.\u000a\u000aEdit: Please, before comment, do take notice that I never called them bad, and also take notice that I never said "don't listen" and that I am only saying "I don't listen, and here is why"

aVTumblr Alert! Tumblr Alert!
p3168
aVNot really? I don't use Tumblr.\u000a\u000aMy issue is more that I don't personally care for those kinds of messages, so I choose not to listen to that music. This was posted and it was expected that people would post their opinion. I posted my opinion. Can we at least discuss it, instead of calling eachother names?\u000a\u000aI didn't even say it was bad music. All I said was I can't get into it.

p3171
aVWhaaa?
p3172
aVI like to think I was very clear, and that my opinion was stated tastefully and tactfully. I do not understand why you're all reacting this way. I didn't even say I disliked the music. I just said I can't get into it.\u000a\u000aI'd just rather not listen to music that expresses opinions and ideas that I disagree with or dislike. I don't listen to Christian Rock for the same reason I don't listen to white supremacist music. I don't agree with the message. Why is this such a fucking problem?
p3173
aVNot a problem but, Edguy religious and sexist? I dont think so...
p3174
aVConsidering that over half their songs are about fucking women?\u000a\u000aAnd the other half are filled with religious references?\u000a\u000aI don't want to hear about the lead singer screwing girls in a bathroom on an airplane. (Lavatory Love Machine)\u000a\u000aI don't want to hear about the lead singer calling himself sexual Jesus or some shit like that. (New Age Messiah)\u000a\u000aI USED to be a HUGE Edguy fan, but when they keep doing music like this... I just can't continue to support messages I don't agree with, and they ARE THERE. I feel my view of their music is valid. I'm not saying don't listen. I'm saying I don't listen, and here is why.\u000a\u000aFor some reason I expected opinion slinging to be more acceptable in this sub.
p3175
aVDo you know what jokes are? 
p3176
aVRegardless of how serious they are, I don't like those jokes. I don't find them funny. To me, it is just being rude, not being a comedian.
p3177
aVOK, I have no problem with you thinking them bad jokes, but you interpretation of said songs as being sexist, or (especially) religious is simply wrong. 
p3178
aVIf you call them sexist for this "reason", you may have to call sexist to a bunch of metal bands then...\u000a\u000aAs a girl, I've never feel offended by Edguy's lyrics. I respect your opinion, but hey, how easy is to write someone's opinion here and make it look like it's the universal truth...
p3179
aVSo you won't listen to any music referencing sex of any sort? Or any music with vaguely religious lyrics? 
p3180
aVyou realize that the metal opera is a massive "fuck off" to organized religion, yeah?\u000a\u000ahaving a theme to a story is not the same thing with supporting the concepts told.  shakespeare was not a racist, yet he wrote othello and merchant of venice, etc.
p3181
aVThe problem is the message you're stating is there is not there.\u000a\u000aFor sexist lyrics, I can only imagine you're talking about songs like 'Aren't You a Little Pervert Too,' 'Two Out of Seven,' and 'Do Me Like a Caveman.' Except these are just 'dirty joke' songs which in no way comment on the superiority of one sex or the other, and the first two in fact do not comment on women at all and could very well concern gay men.\u000a\u000aFor religious lyrics.... uh.... Do you also think Powerwolf is Christian metal? Because neither Powerwolf nor Edguy, which has much less lyrics in anyway about religion, is Christian metal. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3TsVaFR870) is what Christian metal sounds like.
p3182
aVHis post history suggests Powerwolf as "Satanic power metal". I laughed at that.\u000a\u000aBut I don't want to attack this dude for his opinions. We shouldn't be downvoting on here.
p3183
aVThe problem we have isn't what you said. It's that what you're saying has no basis within reality. 
p3184
aVWait what
p3185
aVHaving met Edguy, they did not seem like what you're describing at all, and the music isn't what you describe at all either. I can only think of two asongs that even hint at religious in anyway and that's "Ministry Of Saints" &amp; "Pride Of Creation", two of my favourites btw, and I really can't see any of their songs as sexist.
p3186
aVAs a cis pig myself...what?
p3187
aVI never mentioned my identity, your identity, or anyone's identity. Why did you bring gender identity into this? I was speaking of religiosity and sexism, not identity. Where the fuck did that come from? Jeez...

aVThis is the kind of bands that everyone just have their favorites and everybody is naturally drawn to the covers of the games they played or shows they watched. I can see you're a Final Fantasy player and so you take a liking of those songs.\u000a\u000aI'd say my favorite is The Simpsons one, it's so fucking whacky and i think that it's just really well done. Gotta Catch em all is also really great and my nostalgia nerves just start tingling when i heard the melody.\u000a\u000aI'm more flabbergasted that the guys from Powerglove somehow managed to get Kakko on their songs.
p3196
aVSA took them on tour. They must get along. :p
p3197
aVYeah pretty much. Really though, that Final Fantasy composer is a genius.\u000a\u000aIt's ridiculous, I'm imagining Kakko sitting with his Game Boy and Pokemon Red, training his Charizard. 
p3198
aVHow Storm Eagle did not make the list is open to debate, but lets put it this way;\u000a\u000a* The song on its own; not bad\u000a* The song if you've seen the band live; best song ever!\u000a\u000aThis is mostly due to the chant of "Fuck That Bird" during the song.\u000a\u000a[Case and Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZzwWsyIdDk)\u000a\u000aBut everyone is going to have a dispute over what's considered the best tracks depending on what was considered their "fandom".\u000a\u000aAlso, any word on what the next band will be or is that a surprise? (either that or I skipped it somehow)
p3199
aVYeah. I didn't really check out any live videos. Awesome chant, though, I'd really love to see Powerglove live some time. Dunno if they ever tour in Europe...\u000a\u000aDo you generally agree with the rest of the additions, though? They're all great in my eyes, but that's partly because I played all those games. On the other hand, I also played Mega Man X and most of the other games they've covered.\u000a\u000aI would have added the upcoming bands, but I was over the character limit. Anyway, I'll be doing Dragonland next.
p3200
aVI agree with most of what's up there. Storm Eagle aside, everything looks good except maybe Gotta Catch 'Em All, but this is current me rating it, not 13 year old me rating the original theme. I'd add Inspector Gadget and Johnny Quest but you basically nailed all the good tracks from their 2nd album.\u000a\u000aAlso, looking forward to Dragonland since I only know one, maybe two albums by them, so I'm always looking to see what's recommended or what to stay away from.

aVI'm going to skip the writeup and just say that I don't enjoy these guys. I'm all in favour of gimmicks and all that cool stuff, but this just doesn't work for me (and I'm a gamer too).

aVI usually opt for harder tracks, but a select few softer tracks (like "When All is Lost") just hit right home. Usually the voice needs to be amazing to keep my interest (Russell Allen delivers). The instrumental segment with all the keyboard and guitar solos does kick just about every other song's ass, though.

Ingham, a [warship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Ingham_%28WHEC-35%29), sounds like England.

aVit was a long shot you nailed it :p it was really bugging me
p3270
aVThat's probably my favorite Sabaton song, but the whole album is pretty good IMO.  The album is called Primo Victoria, I'm pretty sure it's one of the free ones you can download with an amazon prime membership as well.

aVYou should absolutely check out more of Sabaton's stuff if you haven't already, they're awesome.

asVThis Week in Power Metal Releases (12/29 - 1/04)
p3275
(lp3276
VAll the spectators lose their shit, its great. It's a shame that nothing like that can ever happen in wwe
p3277
aVWell, looks like I have an exam to to on the 7th of January, so next weeks previews thread and my own Best Previews of 2014 will have to wait until after that.\u000a\u000aThanks for filling in /u/UnlostHorizon, I had almost given up hope that there would be Power Metal to listen to this week.\u000a\u000aMy Opinion (based upon previews only):\u000a\u000a- It's my opinion that you should all go listen to **Immortal Guardian**s EP again. That thing was fucking great.\u000a\u000aWhat I missed last week:\u000a\u000a- **Age of Artemis:** The foundations of this song reminds me of those good late 90s Rock tunes - it's not too extreme, it's not too fast, and it's not memorable, but it definitely helps the additions sound better, and makes it great. The light ~~trash~~ thrash inserted into the base tune helps to break things up, and the vocals take a huge focus, and they are pretty decent. Overall, it's probably not all that memorable, but it is still a good song.\u000a\u000a- **Eternal Dream:** I really like the drive and instrumentation of the song, and I somewhat like the Operatic nature of the vocals. For once, I feel like the high pitch of the vocals *work* with the instruments (probably due to the keyboard adding additional buffer room for the vocalist to sing that high), and the operatic singing matches the speed and drive of the instrumentation, allowing them to both benefit from one another. Initially, I was going to say that I dislike it, but as time has gone on, I have come to actually like what I hear. There you have it guys, I may have come to like Operatic vocals!\u000a\u000a- **CETI:** I don't really know what to say about this song - I like it, but nothing really stands out as a reason why. It's just a solid Heavy Metal song, with nothing really glaringly wrong with it, but also nothing specifically outstandingly right with it.\u000a\u000a- **Sonic Pulse:** I don't really like this one all that much unfortunately - it's too much Punk, not enough Metal for me to overly enjoy, The instrumentation feels inconsistent and disjointed during the sections where there are no singing (it gets better later on, but still has remnants of the aimlessness), and the vocals don't really add anything of note to the whole performance. Overall, I don't really like it all that much.\u000a\u000a- **Sethirus:** Don't like this one either. It's a lighter Thrash Metal song, but it is still definitely Thrash Metal. The guitar solo is great, but other than that, I don't really see any reason why I would enjoy what this song has going on. Overall, not my shit, but maybe someone else will like it.\u000a\u000a/u/~~Sinuata~~Horizons Recommendation:\u000a\u000a- **Lost Horizon:** Ah, good place to leave Power Metal for the year /u/UnlostHorizon! I would have been very disappointed if the last song of the year had been something Thrashy and altogether not that enjoyable. Luckily your fans made a dedication band to you, and they play great Power.\u000a\u000aHuge Thanks to /u/sinuatabouquet, /u/mushmancat and /u/UnlostHorizon for taking time out of their schedules, every single week, to compile these lists and find links to the music for us all to listen to, and a massive thanks to you guys for putting up with my bullshit for the 9 or so months I have been forcing my opinions on you, you guys are great, and I hope to join you all in rocking out to Power Metal next year and into the future as well! I'll see you guys next year!

aVMan, I'm really itching for bands like Sonic Pulse and Sethirus that have really good singers. Like, they don't quite sound like people singing, they're just sorta shouting. I really dig the instrumentation, but come on, we gotta get some sweet vocals in here. Thrash instrumentation is fine enough but I just can't get over the vocal style

p3292
aVI take my music a lot more seriously than most people on this subreddit, it seems.  There is nothing inherently wrong with it, though.  I just do not like it.  I prefer more intellectual or fantasy based lyrics.
p3293
aV&gt;I take my music a lot more seriously than most people on this subreddit\u000a\u000aThat just sounds elitist as fuck.     \u000aDifferent kinds of music fit different kinds of moods and situations. I love White Pearl, Black Oceans. I like ten minute long epic masterpieces. I also find the line "raise your phallus to the sky/and you'll never die" very amusing.
p3294
aVYou have people saying they like this and that because it's "silly" and "not meant to be taken seriously".  All I am saying is I never feel that way.  I am not saying other people cannot take music seriously in the right mood, I am simply saying I tend to take music more seriously as a whole than most people on this subreddit.  I do not find the line you quoted amusing.

p3318

p3319
aVUm, okay.  I'd say it is, but I suppose that's neither here nor there.  I'm not suggesting that this shouldn't be posted here.  I upvoted it!\u000a\u000aI recognize that people have different definitions of Power Metal, and if Metal Church fits their definitions, then okay, whatever.  It's still great music.
p3320
aVI have to give you props for embracing your ignorance.
p3321
aV"Ignorance", eh?  Apparently, we have two different definitions of that as well.  I hope this isn't a trend, or I'll wonder if one of us isn't a space alien! :P\u000a\u000aSeriously, though.  I'm not quite sure how I feel about this.  I recognize that you're a mod for this subreddit, and (for the moment) I'm certainly not interested in challenging why that is.  One doesn't become a mod without good reason, especially on a sub like this.\u000a\u000aThat being said, you do seem to be acting rather condescending towards me.  I admit that I'm somewhat new to this sub, as I haven't posted here much, so I can't tell if you're being serious or just trolling me.  It is a bit disconcerting for me.\u000a\u000aNow, perhaps you could argue that I was being condescending with my original comment by passive-aggressively asserting my own opinion about Metal Church being Power Metal, and I'll accept that.  I will fully acknowledge that my definitions and distinctions about genres are pedantic, arbitrary, and highly personal.  I have my reasons, and I may endeavor to back them up with arguments that I think make some sense, but I certainly have no delusions over trying to insist that my definitions are perfect and should be used by everyone else.  If people are posting stuff like Metal Church as Power Metal, I certainly don't (and won't) aim to stop them.\u000a\u000aHowever, I don't think I've done any real harm by saying what I said.  It's just my opinion, and, while I do enjoy expressing my opinion about the things I care about (who doesn't?), in my original comment, I was willing to (mostly) set it aside and praise the post because it's a great song by a great band.  Just because it doesn't fit my exact definitions of Power Metal is kind of irrelevant.\u000a\u000aI do have an issue with the use of the word "ignorance", though  Maybe because I spend too much time on the internet, but far too often the word (and its derivatives) is used to describe opinions that don't match one's own exactly, usually in an effort to discredit other people's opinions, often breaking things down into a contentious, "Us and Them" dichotomy, which often leaves little room for middle ground or open-mindedness.\u000a\u000aHowever, I recognize that you're a mod, and I'm (admittedly) assuming that this isn't a word you would throw around lightly, which is why I suspect you're testing me or trolling me or something.  I don't believe you're trying to make enemies.  In short, I just don't know what I'm dealing with, which is I'm left disconcerted.\u000a\u000aIf there is anything I *should* apologize for, it's the length of this comment.  I admit this is pretty normal for me, partially because I'm English Major and I feel the need to explain things as clearly as I can. I highly doubt you expecting anything this long over something like this, but I felt like I should express my concerns about this conversation before things get any worse.
p3322
aVMy problem is being a mod I guess I'm expected to phrase my posts differently than I'm used to. Still getting used to being green. So I apologize. \u000a\u000aI'm not out to make enemies I'm just abrasive. Don't be afraid to call me a douchebag if that's how you feel. I can tend to be one. \u000a\u000aAs for our original disagreement,  thinking over things made me realize my point of view was outdated. There are is so much blending of genres nowadays that it can be left to opinion at times. I don't feel that applies to metal church but we'll just have to agree to disagree. I hope my abrasiveness doesn't dissuade you from posting here in the future, I don't mean any harm. 
p3323
aVNo problem!  I know that mods are people, too.  I didn't mean to turn this into any kind of deal (I know it kind of looks like it because of my wall of text!).  I just wanted to be clear about what was going on is all.

p3381
aVBought the 2 disc set just cause how i appreciate what it did for BM. Not even much of a fan of BM.
p3382
aVAlso it wasn't bad. Maybe cause of less singing? :P Jk
p3383
aVDon't dis my PK! 
p3384
aVYou're almost as bad of a poster as /u/mushmancat is. Stop with the obvious trollbait. This is the third time you've posted one of PelleK's covers with the same sarcastic and provocative title, and it's really a waste of everyone's time. 
p3385
aVBy the way, I've discovered a bunch of bands thanks to mushie, whether he dislikes them or not, so suck on that.
p3386
aVIf you don't think this cover sounds a lot better than most of his tripe, you can't dislike nor appreciate anything music-related. Leave the hall and fuck all the haters. This one wasn't that bad and you know it, shill. If you think he's so amazing, why don't you post his stuff so he get more views? I'm the one doing that and I'm not even a big fan, so what does that say about you?
p3387
aVI don't even like PelleK. What are you talking about? But the last time I checked, at least he has the guts to post his covers on YouTube for the world to see. That's more than I can say for 95% of this subreddit. Constructive criticism and expressing your opinion are what you should be doing in these cases when you don't like someone's video; making it your goal to just flat-out mock and ridicule them is childish and juvenile. To be honest, it's not like I expected much more out of someone whose username is "realkman666".
p3388
aVWhat is the opinion of posting a video? Watch it and judge for yourself, a lot of people like him, most of the time I don't. So fucking what? He spreads the metal love his own way and I have no problem with that.  \u000a\u000aHey, you dissed my username! Fucking A-level shit right there! 
p3389
aVYou don't see me posting Skylark videos every week and going "Look how bad this is. Everyone laugh at this bullshit!". That's exactly what you're doing with these PelleK videos. If you just titled these videos by what they were (PelleK - Symphony of the Night cover), I'd give you a pass. \u000aBut you're just being obnoxious and insufferable for the sake of being obnoxious and insufferable.
p3390
aVAt least he's taking the time to listen to all these PelleK songs! Some part of him must enjoy these...
p3391
aVThat's a really twisted way of looking at it. You could say he's a closet PelleK fan.
p3392
aVThere are a few that I wish I'd never heard, though.
p3393
aVNow I know how you feel and I can adapt to please you, mysterious stranger.
p3394
aVNice try Pellek.
p3395
aVAnybody noticed Pellek's new album "Cloud Dancers" is out?\u000a\u000a(I haven't listened to it but the title track is boring)
p3396
aVYeah, it's in the new releases post that's stickied right now. The title track seems to be the most boring of the bunch. "Tempest", the only other song I checked out, is actually pretty good.
p3397
aVYeah, but I don't do iTunes and his air guitar skills in the video threw me off. :/
p3398
aVso someone needs to tell me why PelleK is actually so hated here. 
p3399
aVWhile I don't think it's enough to justify the constant ridicule:\u000a\u000a1. He sounds very nasally/whiny in his upper ranges, which he tends to significantly overuse. I actually think he sounds pretty good in his lower ranges.\u000a\u000a2. He comes off as over-confident. From his general attitude, to some of the songs he's written or chosen, to the first issue where he overuses his weaker high vocals.\u000a\u000a3. I guess people don't like his face?
p3400
aVEh I'd say his high vocals in reality are probably a lot stronger than many power metal singers would be in a live setting. While him sounding whiny is kind of a personal preference, he's got a shit ton of control and power in his higher register.
p3401
aVHe's not really hated. He just doesn't bother listening to a song before performing it, so he just sounds off, out of tune, out of touch and a big douche that thinks he's great while murdering melody and phrasing. He's very able, but he needs a teacher badly.
p3402
aVso I might be wrong and he may just be butchering a song, but you bring up something that i think is a problem on this sub. Covering a song does not mean imitation, in fact you should change it up if you're actually a singer. A lot of people here want a cover to sound exactly the same tonally, and that's just not what a cover is. In fact, if it is that, it's usually boring as shit. So what a long of singers do is homogenize the melody to change things up, make it theirs, and possibly make it a little easier to sing. Placement in singing is also a way to make things easier, especially if you're singing this kind of stuff often. 
p3403
aVAs a guitarist, what he does is akin to using heavy distortion on everything, banging on the whammy bar at the end of every phrase and soloing over the intro of every song. He has a possibly good voice, but he uses it in a clueless way 95% of the time. He's not a good musician.
p3404
aVI'm a guitarist too and those comparisons don't make a lot of sense to me. Are you saying that the stylistic choices are over the top? No shit, it's power metal, those are also the choices he makes to personalize his song. Whether you like it or not, that's your personal taste. But for a metal singer to be able to improvise the way he does, he's definitely a good musician.
p3405
aVHe has no sense of music, he's not improvising.

(lp3409
VMy favorite Edguy album but this song has always sounded like ssomething straight out of a kids learning show. 
p3410
aVI want to see a cage match between "Trinidad" and "Land of the Miracle" for worst song on the album. \u000a\u000aIt (Trinidad) has a couple good riffs  but for the most part, I've always thought it sounds like "The Little Mermaid" threw up on it. 
p3411
aVHonestly I just like it because of how happy it is, and the slight Carribean style it has is really unique for a metal song. Obviously I wouldn't like it if Edguy did this all the time but in such a small dose it's enjoyable.
p3412
aVDefinitely way too happy. He's glad he's away from his wife, I'm glad I'm away from that song. \u000a\u000aTheir "joke songs" are too campy for me. Even when they say "hair force one" is almost too much, but it's such a good song.

VWhy don't we call this sub /r/blindguardian and call it a day. 
p3419
aVOne of the most popular bands in the genre hasn't released a single for a bit over 3 years. It's unsurprising that within the few months we got TotG and the actual album, BG spiked a bit because people remembered the band exists and got excited.\u000a\u000aIf you look at the weekly top list, 3 posts on the first page are related to Blind Guardian, only one is a song by them(Noldor) and the other 2 are from a side project(Demons &amp; Wizards).
p3420
aV...and if you look at the monthly top list, you'll see the following:\u000a\u000aa song by Nightwish, a song by Rhapsody, a song by Blind Guardian, Blind Guardian new album stream, a song by Blind Guardian, a link to the Blind Guardian AMA, a song by Blind Guardian, two songs by Symphony X, a song by Alestorm, a post about modding, two songs by Sonata Arctica, a song by Stratovarius, a post about Blind Guardian, the powermetal awards (aka a post about Blind Guardian), two posts about Avantasia, Blind Guardian official album discussion, a post about Blind Guardian, a song by Demons &amp; Wizards, a song by Amon Amarth and Avantasia.\u000a\u000a...and if you look at the top posts of all time you have the following:\u000a\u000aDragonland and Keldian AMA, two posts about Pentakill (the fuck?), 1 song by Nightwish, 1 by Rhapsody and 1 by Helloween, four joke posts (two about dragonforce, one about sabaton), 3 Sabaton songs / posts and 11 Blind Guardian related posts. \u000a\u000aBG isn't spiking here, it's drilling through the sky. I stand by my initial comment. \u000a\u000aHell, I'm scared to search "Blind Guardian" or "Sabaton" here because I'll probably get back half the total posts in this sub. 
p3421
aVThe monthly and all-time tops are to be expected.\u000a\u000aBG is one of the most popular bands in the genre. If you go to /r/progmetal, are you surprised their top of all time encompasses the genres most popular bands? Or if you go to /r/metal you see the same trend?\u000a\u000aThe monthly top hits the release of their album, not at all surprising. I wonder what it'd look like if you took the first page of the monthly top submissions from all weeks of january 2013 and up to now to see if it spikes as much.\u000a\u000aIf you look at the time stamps on the top submissions, that kinda follows what I'm saying. I just looked through the 4 first pages(100 submissions) and I got this graph: [link](http://i.imgur.com/xzH7202.png). There's 28 entries in total. While that does indicate BG is very popular on this subreddit historically, do note that 12 of those falls within the last 4 months and 7 are not older than a month. That's 43% of all submissions in the time surrounding the release of TotG and the album. A graph that would show the number of submissions per month over eg 2 years, may be a better indicator, but I'm not capable of writing that scraper.
p3422
aV&gt;Hell, I'm scared to search "Blind Guardian" or "Sabaton" here because I'll probably get back half the total posts in this sub. \u000a\u000aI'm more scared of heights but that's just me.

In a data series that goes back to Sep 2011(42 months), that's 27% of the submissions in a time frame constituting roughly 10% of the period. \u000a\u000aHere are the number of submissions per month sorted by most mentions:\u000a\u000a     13 Jan 2015\u000a     10 Feb 2015\u000a      7 Nov 2014\u000a      7 May 2014\u000a      6 Jan 2013\u000a      5 Jun 2013\u000a      5 Jul 2013\u000a      5 Feb 2013\u000a      5 Dec 2012\u000a      4 Mar 2014\u000a      4 Mar 2013\u000a      4 Jul 2012\u000a      4 Jan 2014\u000a      4 Dec 2014\u000a      4 Aug 2014\u000a      3 Oct 2013\u000a      3 Jul 2014\u000a      3 Dec 2013\u000a      2 Sep 2012\u000a      2 Oct 2014\u000a      2 Nov 2013\u000a      2 Nov 2012\u000a      2 May 2013\u000a      2 Jun 2014\u000a      2 Feb 2012\u000a      2 Aug 2012\u000a      2 Apr 2013\u000a      1 Sep 2014\u000a      1 Sep 2013\u000a      1 Sep 2011\u000a      1 Oct 2012\u000a      1 Nov 2011\u000a      1 May 2012\u000a      1 Mar 2012\u000a      1 Jan 2012\u000a      1 Feb 2014\u000a      1 Dec 2011\u000a      1 Aug 2013\u000a      1 Apr 2014\u000a      1 Apr 2012

(lp3452
VNo wrestling gif? Leave the hall!\u000a\u000a**Darking** - Nothing special, a bit too repetitive. Have no clue what the singer is saying, too thick of an accent.\u000a\u000a**Lujuria** - Vanilla Hard rock, with some rough vocals and banging riffs, the use of the organ adds some variation to the song. Good solo performance, ok I'll stop it.\u000a\u000a**Wildpath** - Starts slowly almost with the inception [bwong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2jUhnCU9iA), it goes onto a groovy riff and then the female vocals kicks in and the song falls apart. Imo, this song would be better if we had Russel Allen roughy vocal style. The rest of the song just doesn't do anything for me.\u000a\u000a**Wind Rose** - Wind Rose is a bad name for a band. The song starts pretty poorly but then it slides in a very well done chant that took me by surprise and the song evolves into something much more special. Very good song, give it a shot. The 1:00 - 1:05 segment is definitely reminiscent of Lost Horizon. My biggest gripe with the song is not the slow start, its the retarded sudden halt at 3:20, just... why? It's so out of place.\u000a\u000a**Yesterdays Saints** - These intros man, they suck. Once we get past the initial overused thrashy riff, the song is not that bad. However, this has to be used one of the poorest uses of double bass in drumming, just because you can go fast, doesn't mean you should. At the 3 minute mark the drummer finally gains some sense and drops a nice blast beat only to lose his mind once again. All in all kind of a weird song.\u000a\u000a**Lykaion** - Heavy Lullabies?? Are you serious? Well this put me into a sleeping state. Boring. Very boring.\u000a\u000a**Hagbard** - Kind of a cool song ruined by the horrible rough vocals, their just bad.\u000a\u000a**Acero Letal** - [Yeah! Fuck Yeah!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Soz617b8xNY). Old school speed metal raping my ears 200 mph, now that's what I'm talking. The song is too long for it's own good but boy does it kick in like a mule on steroids. Very fun song. If you're into good ol' speed metal, this one is for you.\u000a\u000a[My question to all the new mods](http://i.imgur.com/FYj1odK.jpg)

aVDecided to give a listen to this week's music, here's my thoughts along with ratings of some odd nature (also in reverse order listed for a reason I don't wish to edit at this time)\u000a\u000a**Acero Letal:** Couldn't understand a word that was said, but damn if I didn't enjoy it. Felt it dragged on for too long, but it stayed entertaining throughout. *Worth multiple listens.*\u000a\u000a**Hagbard:** I enjoyed this. Could have done with less of the growling as I enjoyed the clean vocals more. Although, it's not indistinguishable growls, so I approve there. Otherwise, *standard folk metal.*\u000a\u000a**Lykaion:** Was not a fan of this one. From the intro alone I felt it would be a letdown, and it didn't disappoint there. It felt like music that I'd skip on my ipod and then wonder why it was there in the first place. *Not Recommended*\u000a\u000a**Yesterdays Saints:** I got a bit of a Nevermore vibe when the vocals came in clean and near the end. Intro could have been shortened if not cut out. Not bad otherwise. *Worth a listen*\u000a\u000a**Wind Rose:** The intro threw me off as I was expecting a softer folk song. I've seen plenty of bands like this (kilts, facepaint, songs of glory) but it's entertaining here so I'll let it slide. *Perfect song for D&amp;D or LARP, good song otherwise.*\u000a\u000a**Wildpath:** Female vocals, was not expecting that. Guess I should have with the sound of the band. Nothing really stood out here. Just middle of the pack Symphonic Metal. *6 out of 10*\u000a\u000a**Lujuria:** Ugh, that album cover...what is this 1981 and the Scorpions? Kidding aside, these guys rock! Heavy Metal done right! Only thing not making this a perfect song is the lyrics not being in English, but this is damn good nonetheless. *My recommendation of the week.*\u000a\u000a**Darking:** I had high hopes walking into this one. With the tag "Epic Heavy Metal" it's hard not to. Bass solo was nice to hear, but the guitar solo felt as if it was just "there". I'm sure the whole album is a worthwhile listen, as the idea behind this song/video makes me think this is a concept album. *Interested for more of their material*\u000a\u000aAlso, bonus points to whoever put the picture on the sidebar that leads to this post.

VUpvote for Masterplan!\u000a\u000aThough I don't particularly care for this song. Chorus is pretty smooth but the song bores me
p3487
aVI only found Masterplan recently and this track was one I liked, along with ["Wounds"](http://youtu.be/-ylf1hpOt7E) and ["Call the Gypsy"](http://youtu.be/sJBOZifHdD4), what other ones would you recommend?
p3488
aVAllow me to refer to a [Masterplan review](http://redd.it/2kpm7b) I wrote earlier.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, if you enjoy like Jorn, I wrote a [short summary of his solo records](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2uccbv/what_are_some_of_jorns_best_albums/co74nr3) some weeks ago.\u000a\u000aIf you still have questions, I'd be happy to answer them!

aVKinda off topic but hows Nightwish live? I only know a handful of songs by them and am considering seeing the Sabaton/Nightwish show that's coming to my area in May. 
p3495
aVYou can watch their Wacken concert on Youtube to get a feeling for them.
p3496
aVI very much enjoyed Nightwish live.  Floor is fantastic and Marco's voice is just piercing!  Sabaton is worth the price of admission, too.
p3497
aVInstanzia and Borealis are both planning to finally release their new albums this year. I'm really hyped for those when they finally get released. Also, the tribute to Sonata Arctica, I supported the kickstarter for it and the album will be coming in the mail sometime.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Oh yeah, also symphony X\u000a\u000aEDIT 2: Maybe cellador?

aVI would love for a new Aorlhac, Aquilus, Lifeform, Xe-NONE, Blacklodge and Ea album but that's probably not going to happen\u000a\u000aFor things that are going to be released, I'm  hyped for the new Galar, Kauan, Oxxo Xoox, Odious, Ages and probably 20 new Senmuths. Nothing Power Metal has really got my attention this year. \u000a\u000aEdit: Definitely hoping for a new Progenie Terrestre Pura as well
p3505
aVEven though Nightwish is one of my favorite bands, my first experience with powermetal (and not symphonic metal like Nightwish) is Rhapsody (before the name change).

VI'll definitely be giving this a spin when it releases. Loved their last one so, despite the change in singers, i'm hoping this one can be somewhere close to it.

p3544
aVLooks like this is going to be the first big cheesefest of the year and I'm looking forward to it.\u000a\u000aI have to say though, I'm a bit disappointed that Olaf won't be singing in it. He was far and away the best thing about Magic Kingdom's last album. I liked the new singer in Epicrenel's album however... we'll see how this turns out. 
p3545
asVSymphony X- Paradise Lost
p3546
(lp3547
VThis song is great when played on a CD, but seeing Russel Allen sing it live, now thats a life changing experience. I have always held the belief  that Symphony X is ten times better live than in album format.
p3548
aVI can only imagine the energy. I haven't seen them yet but they are near the top of my list of must-see bands. I love the *Live at the End of the World* album though, I play that over the studio releases. Hopefully they come to Australia. 
p3549
aVI'm not ashamed to admit that /u/ametalfellow and I may have sobbed a bit when Symphony X played this on the 70K cruise in 2014. The atmosphere during this song was ridiculous.\u000a\u000aRussell dedicated the song to the band's very good friend and (former) sound guy, Nate. He mentioned that "the last time we played this song, Nate was with us and now. . .he's no longer here. But we know he's on the ship watching over us. So this one's for you, Nathan." That was a bit touching.
p3550
aVTruth. I was unabashedly crying for pretty much the whole song... and the "Triumphant champion of Ithaca" part of the odyssey, because duh.
p3551
aVAint no shame in crying at a metal show. First time I heard hallowed be thy name live I was in tears. Eveeytime I listen to the Beast over Hammersmith version I get choked up at how perfect it is.

p3558
aVSame here! Metallica ----&gt; Dream Theater ----&gt; Symphony X and the world opened up after that. I am very fortunate to have seen Symphony X live twice. And the fact that Russell Allen can sing live just how he does on albums blew my fucking mind. 
p3559
aVHoly hell, are you me? This is pretty much the exact route I took between high school and now. Unfortunately, I haven't had the chance to see Symphony X live yet, but would've killed to see them on tour with Dream Theater.
p3560
aVYou're welcome!
p3561
aVThat bridge has one of my favorite Russell Allen vocal performances ever. So many emotions. All the emotions.
p3562
aVThis is probably one of my favorite albums ever and definitely my favorite song from the album. Incredible.
p3563
aVI love how people have this assumption that anything heavier than Metallica must be black or death metal and then I show them stuff like this and say it was composed by a metal band, and a damn good one at that. \u000a\u000aI love shredding solos and thundering drum parts, but there is something about slower ballad-type songs that just really hits home when they're so well-done. \u000a\u000aThe lyrics are spot-on if you've read Paradise Lost, too. As a British Literature major in college, that scored huge points with me.

asVRiot - Dance Of Death. Riot's pinnacle?
p3610
(lp3611
VI consider Thundersteel to be their pinnacle, but this is a great follow up to such a superb album.
p3612
aVThundersteel is also my favorite album of theirs, and Immortal Soul might actually top this one as well, but this song is probably my favorite Riot song. 
p3613
aVMy two cents: The album could have been, but unfortunately isn't due to horrible execution.  If we take the straight power/speed songs on this album, and put it tick for tack against Thundersteel, I believe this album would crush it--it's the full actualization of that sound.  Unfortunately, that only accounts for maybe 50% of this album.  The weird experimentation with horns, the unnecessarily long noise/media intros (Should've taken a note out of Toxik's Think This and kept it short... it appeared this album was channeling Toxik to some degree to begin with just based on the cover art and concept) and the strikingly out of place hard rock and hair metal songs (Little Miss Death and Maryanne stand out as being particularly egregious) all sort of make this album fall flat of its true potential for me.  Should've been the best, but is ultimately dragged down by what are just flat out some of the most odd and mind boggling creative decisions in this band's (or any otherwise competent band's) history.  \u000a\u000aBut the songs that stand out, like this one, definitely rest at the top of Riot's creative output.
p3614
asVWhat do you think about "Jorn Lande &amp; Trond Holter present Dracula - Swing Of Death"
p3615
(lp3616
VSo far, it's taken up my 2nd place for AOTY. Absolutely love the album 10/10
p3617
aVI can't agree with Fazermint words. Maybe it's not that much heavy, but it's great. I totally love Jorn voice and i think that if you liked "Walking on Water" you'll propably like the rest of this album. Can't decide which song is the best, because every song on this album is unique and different. But there's no boring songs here. And even that i'm not a huge fan of female vocals in metal, This female vocalist we have here's pretty decent. Trond Holter is doing pretty good work on guitar, drums are working well. And since i'm a big fan of Castlevania series i really liked lyrics and general Dracula theme.\u000a\u000atl;dr 8/10
p3618
aVIt's definitely a weak release when compared to Jorn's own solo albums, I'd say. It's hard rock, so it's less heavy than you'd like for an album featuring Jorn. Some songs have a clear touch of classical music, and these are usually duets with an unknown female vocalist (she's not *unknown* but I have never heard of her). It's by far the "softest" release Jorn has ever put out. It's enjoyable in its own right, but I'd much rather just listen to one of Jorn's solo albums.
p3619
aVI fully expected this to be a train wreck, I'm surprised and disappointed to say this is not the pile of shit I though it was going to be, It's surprisingly good but a bore-fest nonetheless. The big ace up their sleeves are the always great vocals by Jorn; Guitars done by Trond are not the low point of the album and the man is definitely talented. However, everything feels a bit too forced, the whole theatrical aspect and symphonic stuff seems out of place and draws inspirations from stuff like Epica, Savatage and the sorts. The lyrics seem very weak, I expected more since it was a rock opera.\u000a\u000aBig fucking plus, no shitty narration like in most rock operas, this albums sports individual songs that link themselves to the greater narrative. The better song on the album is Walking On Water and even that one is kind of boring. So If you don't like Walking On Water, this album is not for you.\u000a\u000a**TLDR: 5/10**

p3665
aVI pretty much agree with this, except I have Reasons to Live from Ultra Beatdown for DragonForce and The Divine Wings of Tragedy for Symphony X.
p3666
aVReasons to Live has one of my most fav solo sections; it's really dynamic. I was comparing it to Evening Star and Valley of the Damned though, and I can't explain why but Evening Star is my favorite. As for SX, Divine Wings is amazing, but the start of the solo in When All is Lost really hits me more. 
p3667
aVMore than fair. I picked Reasons to Live because I felt it was one of DragonForce's best efforts at writing lyrics that have more depth than the standard generic power/heavy metal fare they also use (see something like Inside the Winter Storm, Above the Winter Moonlight, or even Soldiers of the Wasteland, which are by no means bad songs).\u000a\u000aThe Divine Wings of Tragedy was one of the first albums that got me into more progressive music, so I'm biased.
p3668
aVActually now that I'm looking at my music library, I might put "Last Man Stands" above Evening Star. Again, I can't explain it. DragonForce isn't one of the bands I particularly pick out lyricism but I do think they got better after Inhuman Rampage. I like their recent albums which have tighter songwriting, but I kind of miss the really long 9 minute songs; maybe they can do a 10+ minute one day.\u000a\u000aFair point about Divine Wings although my favorite on that album is Of Sins and Shadows. I think Twilight in Olympus is one of their most underrated albums though. Dream Theater is the band that got me into progressive music. If you like prog metal like SX, you should listen to Suspyre. Highly recommended especially their album When Time Fades...
p3669
aVGood to see some love for Pride Of The Tyrant. One of their best for sure. Such a same neither of the Rhapsody's ever played the song live. 
p3670
aVGlad to see other people love Pride of the Tyrant too. I think it's one of their most underrated songs. I need to give their discography more listens, but I like Power of the Dragonflame more than the deified Symphony of Enchanted Lands. 
p3671
aVI agree on that count too. Power Of The Dragonflame is my favorite album of theirs(and possibly my favorite album overall). It's perfect mix of heaviness and symphonic elements.  
p3672
aV**Power Quest** - [Far Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpQKCHMNPk4)\u000a\u000a**Blind Guardian** - [Mirror Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfNOKQdY-U)\u000a\u000a**DragonForce** - [Valley of the Damned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUWCrCXiVpA)

p3674
aVI guess there's a lot of love for "Master of Sorrow." "Down from the Mountain" was my fav from their latest album but I haven't given it many listens, although their first album is still my favorite.
p3675
aVMagnus Karlsson is brilliant (Allen Lande 1-3 and Kiske-Somerville). While the vocals tend not to be as soaring high as his main material, it seems like it lets the singers relax a little
p3676
aVSigh....I hate to do this but,  \u000a\u000aBlind Guardian - Bright Eyes  \u000a    \u000aGamma Ray - Rebellion in Dreamland  \u000a  \u000aLost Horizon - The World Through My Fateless Eyes  \u000a  \u000aSavatage - Strange Wings  \u000a  \u000aFreedom Call - The Quest  \u000a  \u000aSymphony X - Egypt  \u000a  \u000aSabaton - 40:1\u000a  \u000aWould post more but I can't remember bands or song names half the time.  Just shower me with Blind Guardian upvotes plz.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p3677
aVI find it hard to pick *one* for Blind Guardian, there are just so many. There should almost be an exception for that band to include one from each album.
p3678
aVMy personal favorites:\u000a\u000a* Sabaton - Ghost Division\u000a\u000a* Gamma Ray - Rebellion in Dreamland\u000a\u000a* Stratovarius - Darkest Hours\u000a\u000a* Nightwish - not entirely PM but I really really love Dead Gardens\u000a\u000a* Symphony X - Communion and the Oracle\u000a\u000a* Sonata Arctica - Fullmoon\u000a\u000a* Kamelot - The Human Stain\u000a\u000a* Dark Moor - The Road Again\u000a\u000a* Iron Savior - Coming Home
p3679
aVHere's mine:\u000a\u000a* Angra - The Temple of Hate\u000a* Ascension - The Time Machine\u000a* Blind Guardian - Lost in the Twilight Hall\u000a* Dragonforce - Valley of the Damned\u000a* Dream Evil - Back from the Dead\u000a* Edguy - Theater of Salvation\u000a* Elvenking - Moonchariot\u000a* Gamma Ray - Somewhere out in Space\u000a* Falconer - Purgatory Time\u000a* Galloglass - At the Shadowcross\u000a* Heavenly - Time Machine\u000a* Hibria - Stare at Yourself\u000a* Keldian - Hyperion\u000a* Pathfinder - The Whisper of Ancient Rocks\u000a* Persuader - Judas Immortal\u000a* Rhapsody of Fire - Sad Mystic Moon/The Myth of the Holy Sword\u000a
p3680
aVSolid list. \u000aIt's so hard to pick the best Dream Evil song for me, and though Back From the Dead is top 5, I'm going to have to tie it at Live a Lie/In Flames You Burn.\u000a
p3681
aVIn Flames You Burn definately is a strong contender for best Dream Evil song in my opinion. I'd say that one and The Prophecy would round out my top picks.  
p3682
aVI offer up\u000a\u000a**Kamelot - Forever**\u000a\u000aThis song has so much emotion adapted from the original Grieg. Simple structure, but it works so well. Aggressive riffs, skillfull solos, all overlaid with Khan's voice like orgasmic honey butter. This to me is the quintessential symphonic power metal track. \u000a\u000a**Galneryus - Destiny**\u000a\u000aDon't get me wrong, New Legend and Angel of Salvation are within \u025b of Destiny; this was not an easy pick. But while New Legend showcased Yama-B's vocal power and the most efficient three solo song I've heard, and Angel of Salvation is a simple masterpiece of adaptation from Tchaikovsky, Destiny takes the cake in terms of pure mind-blowing talent in the solos as well as being a bit more focused than Angel of Salvation. Plus, and this is my opinion, but I think Sho's soaring vocals mesh better with Galneryus' neo-classical style than Yama-B's.\u000a\u000aP.S. I heard that Syu fingered a woman once and she died
p3683
aVI agree about Kamelot, maybe I'd tie it with "Karma." As for Galneryus, Destiny is top 3 material, but I'd go with "Angel of Salvation" despite the Tchaikovsky adaptation. Although in terms of guitar, "The Phoenix" can't be beat! 
p3684
aVSymphony X - Iconoclast\u000a\u000aalthough my token "favorite song" is Sonata Arctica - San Sebastian (not the watered down revisited version, I want the original in its impossible-to-do-live glory)
p3685
aVI'd say Reign of Madness over Iconoclast. 
p3686
aV**Iced Earth - Travel in Stygian**\u000a\u000aIced Earth does one thing right and that's have an amazing song end an album, and this was the first one to do such a thing. Amazing thrashy riffs, a great story, and the melancholy ending makes this amazing.\u000a\u000aThis song is actually more amazing when it's the Alive in Athens version, having Matt Barlow on vocals and a piano outro rather than acoustic guitars.
p3687
aV**Rhapsody of Fire** - Triumph for My Magic Steel/Lamento Eroico\u000a\u000a**Nightwish** - Rest Calm\u000a\u000a**Ancient Bards** - Frozen Mind\u000a\u000a**Gwyllion** - The Night Awakes\u000a\u000a**Blind Guardian** - Skalds &amp; Shadows\u000a\u000a**Sabaton** - To Hell and Back\u000a\u000a**Within Temptation** - Covered By Roses\u000a\u000a**Amaranthe** - Invincible
p3688
aVPathfinder - Beyond The Space, Beyond The Time\u000a\u000aI cannot get enough of this song, seriously man. It's like an addiction.
p3689
aVI agree, it's the best song ever. Every time I hear the falsetto section or the ending guitar vs. keyboard duel, I get this otherworldly high.
p3690
asVGalneryus - Enemy to Injustice
p3691
(lp3692
VI honestly couldn't say I expected a song like this from Galneryus, but damn it's good. My favorite song from 2014 and easily one of my top 5 Galneryus songs.
p3693
aVGreat stuff!
p3694
aVThat's my name. Best album of 2014.
p3695
aVThis album is my favorite album of 2014 by far. Shows a more mature and diverse music compared to earlier albums.\u000aAlso the sound quality is much better this time around.\u000aNinja edit: typo
p3696
aVI still maintain that this is the best song of the album, though lately "I Wish" has been giving it a run for its money. 
p3697
aVI must be in the minority here, but I couldn't find a single redeeming track on the new album. Been a big fan since the first album, and love both Yama-B and Sho.
p3698
asVHere's a really funny dude who loves power metal reviewing Edguy's newest album. He's also reviewed Nightwish, Sonata Arctica, Helloween, DragonForce, Korpiklaani, and others; check him out!

asVHas anyone else heard the new version of Fifth Element by Pathfinder with their new singer?
p3708
(lp3709
VSimon was amazing. I wonder what happened to him...\u000aIt's sad. One of the greatest power metal voices and puff, disappeared.
p3710
aVYeah, it is a pretty big step down.  Very sad.  If he does not sound better in their new material, I will be saying goodbye to my favorite band.
p3711
aVI haven't heard it, but your reaction isn't surprising. I didn't like the sound of the new vocalist at all from what I've been able to hear. Pathfinder, I suppose, will have to remain a band with but two albums for me.

aVHey guys, I'm taking a real quick break from studying for my exam to do this, so I may not be as thorough as usual. Regardless.\u000a\u000aMy opinions (based on previews only):\u000a\u000a- **Dethlehem:** Holy shit, am I agreeing with /u/mushmancat on something? Yes. Yes I am. Instrumentally pretty decent at times, and completely aimless and crappy at others. Vocally decent, but not very memorable. Overall, this wasn't all that impressive unless you are impressed by how shit the music video is.\u000a\u000a- The **Musara** video is not available for me, so I dunno what's going on there.\u000a\u000a- **Jupiter:** I'm honestly surprised this was so long. Normally, all JPower previews are 1'30", and any compilation sets are 5 seconds of each song packed into that timeframe. This one was 11 minutes of goddamn glorious JPower. Speaking of the music itself, there is some ridiculous range on their music, going from the traditional JPower light and fast, to the brutal speed/thrash, to the Death-Power (was that even a fucking thing before that song?), to the slow balad, to I don't even fucking know. Honestly, this was bloody great, I'm almost as hyped for this as I am for the Big One, and it comes out on the day of my exam, so as soon as I am done with that, I can pick it up and rock out to it.\u000a\u000a- **Battle Beast:** This was alright, a little too reserved and a little to safe in instrumentation, but overall, a pretty fun song to rock out to. Plus, that guitar solo was fucking rad.\u000a\u000aWhat I missed:\u000a\u000a- **Setheist:** This is different. The instruments are so heavy! I like it. The instrumentation is super heavy and slow. The Vocals are brilliant, and really break up some of the heaviness of the instruments with their softness. The instruments tend to break their own melody at times, but overall, I found this song to be really interesting.\u000a\u000a- **Wizardmask:** Worth the label of Glorious Russian Power Metal? Maybe, it's bloody damn well close. The instrumentation is brilliant, a little slow, but that is made up for by how well they incorporated the symphonic elements to the main tune. The Vocals are what you'd expect from the Russians - insane control, insane inflection, just insanely good.\u000a\u000a/u/UnlostHorizon's Recommendation of the Week:\u000a\u000aHonestly, I think recommending **Jupiter** this week is a no-brainer, because they are too fucking good. It's like a race won by default, there wasn't even any legitimate competition to make things interesting.\u000a\u000a- *Last Moment:* Check out what I said for the first time Jupiter came up in this. This was the song that I meant by "Traditional JPower". And it is - The instrumentation is Fast, Intricate and Light and the Vocals are bright, happy sounding and kept to a small range of pitch. This is the kind of song you show someone when they tell you that JPower is the same as EuroPower to prove them incorrect.\u000a\u000a- *Luminous:* Here is where Jupiter breaks the JPower rules - This is an awesome Balad, and show just how versatile they can be with their music. The instrumentation went from fast and light to slow, rough and epic (By the end, I was wondering how many more guitar solos they could stuff in there).  The vocals went from being kept into a small range of pitch to using the whole spectrum that guy can blast out, and that's before the female backing vocalist comes in to the equation. Overall, it is a great bloody song.\u000a\u000a- *Arcadia:* And Jupiter continues to break the rules of JPower with the next one as well. This one is a lot rougher than Last Moment, and throws in a ton of thrashy techniques. Even with this, they keep everything fast and brutal. The vocals could honestly not be there and I'd still think that this was amazing, but with them... man... Honestly, this is fucking sick.\u000a\u000a- *Darkness:* I've been excited for this one since the beginning of this list. The instrumentation is fast and brutal, while still containing a huge amount of the JPower vibe that you'd want, but that is not the sick thing about *this song*. The fucking vocals man. I got to say that I really love what they did with this song, the Instrumentation is the perfect way to diffuse the roughness and heaviness of the Growlo, and allows the song to be an insane amount of fun. Goddamn brilliant.\u000a\u000a- *~~Koori no Naka no Shoujo~~ \u6c37\u306e\u4e2d\u306e\u5c11\u5973:* And we are back to Traditional JPower. Honestly, after Darkness, I would have liked a song in between it and this to lead back to this lighter style, but even without it, this song is still great. The breakneck pace they set with this song is fucking great.\u000a\u000a- *Sacred Altar:* Honestly, considering how many songs that we have been through from Jupiter, it is telling that this is the only song that I've had any form of reservation towards. The instrumentation is goddamn perfect. The only thing I am half-half about is the Harsh Vocals that they start the song with, which I dislike in pretty much every situation. In this one, everything else is so damn good that I can overlook them.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I forgot to say: "By the end of the week, how about by the end of the motherfucking day mate?"\u000a\u000aWell, that looks like that's it for the week, so I'll go back to studying for my exam. I'll see you all next week, or in my Preview of 2014 thread, whichever comes first (I still have 3 months of previews to sort out, so it'll probably be next weeks thread).
p3792
aV&gt; Koori no Naka no Shoujo (I'm not sure if the name /u/UnlostHorizon gave is correct, because it is on the album cover picture for the next song too)\u000a\u000aWhat I put is the correct song title. "Sacred Altar" was track 2, or the B-side, on the single for "Koori no Naka no Shoujo", and that's just the romanized name of the song. Jupiter usually put two tracks on all of their single releases.\u000a\u000aIt's great to know someone is else is excited for the new Jupiter album too. 2013 felt lacking without some more of their awesome songs.\u000a\u000aExtra props for the aggression in your edit.

p3797
aVThey're all male. I'm relatively sure the guitarist you mentioned, Hizaki, is a cross dresser, but I'm not completely sure if he wears dresses as part of his stage persona or if he does it in normal day-to-day life too.
p3798

aVThanks. I have just recently been getting into metal music. I have been using Amazon Prime to learn about bands I've never heard of before. I was disappointed to see that Noble Beast wasn't available in the Digital Music store.

aVBandcamp is for small labels and independent musicians so it's totally worth it to support your favorite artists on there.  And you can find quite a few /r/PowerMetal approved albums on the site.

(lp3835
VI loved the hell out of that Twilight Force album.  I agree with your assessment of it, but the guy's outrageous soaring vocals sold it for me.
p3836
aVI disagree about Twilight Force a bit.  I mean, it's super cliche/camp to the point of parody, it has a bunch of stupid intro tracks with people impersonating Gandalf and stuff, plus it has Joakim add in some super generic background vocals I'm sure most people here will think are great.  But the guy has an amazing classic high pitched delivery.  It's not one of the best, but doesn't deserve to be one of the worst.\u000a\u000aThere's been a lot of good albums I enjoyed this year: Gloryful, Edgedown, A Sound Of Thunder, Bane of Winterstorm, Ring Of Fire, Elvenking.  I dunno if I've been paying close enough attention to everything coming out to know if they belong in a ranked list.\u000a\u000aFor non-PM I vote Blues Pills, so good.  Nuclear Blast found a keeper there.\u000a\u000aAnyway I've been avoiding the subreddit for the last few weeks or so as it seems to have gone full retard, but I respect your opinions and appreciate you posting something worth reading/clicking.
p3837
aVAs much of an Iced Earth fan boy as I am, I have to agree it was quite the disappointment to hear. I gave this album many many chances and it still failed to meet up to any expectations I had. I even went back and listen to it just recently and it still doesn't meet up to anything that I hoped for, especially when Dystopia was just a such a phenomenal album. (I believe ot was my best of for 2011)\u000a\u000aOtherwise you have a pretty solid list going here. Really can't argue with anything that's on the best of list.
p3838
aVI am really concerned because I just bought that Skull &amp; Bones album, but have to wait until Christmas to hear it. Also, Grailknights was just confirmed for Wacken and they look hilarious so I'm going to see them there. Your words don't inspire much confidence.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, I feel the complete opposite about Twilight Force, Disforia and Viathyn than you do. Who knows. Either way it's cool to see your list.\u000a\u000aJust curious about the following as this was a big year from power metal and these didn't make the list: Dragonforce, Edguy, HammerFall, Iron Savior, Persuader, and Mindmaze
p3839
aVAdd Falconer to the list! Black Moon Rising is easily my album of the year, and in my opinion among the best power metal albums ever released (probably top 15 or so)
p3840
aVI bought that album today (haven't had a chance to listen to it), and can't believe I forgot to mention it above.
p3841
aVFor Dragonforce, The Power Within was the only album from them that I truly enjoyed, So i was optimistic for this years album. Sadly, they reverted right back to their subpar songwriting. \u000a\u000aEdguy, One of my favorite bands, But this album isn't top 10 material for me.  \u000a\u000aHammerfall, That one preview song that released was awesome, but the rest of the album just fell flat for me.  I never consider hammerfall bad, but they just don't excite me. \u000a\u000aIron Savior- I actually can't remember if I listened to the album or not. \u000a\u000aPersuader- Just missed top 10 for me. \u000a\u000aMindmaze- Solid power metal, but I can't see putting it in my top 10.
p3842
aVI really don't understand how people can love Maximum Overload, it's just so random in quality and focus. 
p3843
aVI'm curious as to your thoughts on Pythia's release. It's kind of short notice to be on a best of 2014 list but I think I like it more than Serpent's Curse.
p3844
aVI was a little let down by it. I need to give it more listens in hope that it'll grow on me
p3845
aVWhat, no links for the worst albums? How are we to compare the greatness of the top 10 if there is no drek to compare to?
p3846
aVTop ten worst list was a laugh to read. I feel pretty shitty only having listened to 8, 7, 4 and 1 of the top ten, now I need to at least get Viathyn and Triosphere cause Noble Beast's self titled album was off its head.\u000aAlso, fuck the start of NB's Master Of Depravity sounds similar to [The Meaning Of I - Voyager] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM5rZaUiiLs)
p3847
aVYou better listen to viathyn. It's right [here](https://soundcloud.com/viathyn/sets/cynosure) full streamable.
p3848
aVI'm glad to see Xandria on at least one list.
p3849
aVMassive cheers from the Viathyn camp!!\u000a\u000aI'm very stoked to have made your #3 spot for both Album and Song of the year. We're an unknown and unsigned band, so every little bit of buzz is appreciated, and every little bit of praise just warms my bones like sitting in front of a fire with a cozy blanket and a healthy measure of scotch.\u000a\u000aGotta start writing album 3 pretty soon here *grumble grumble..*
p3850
aVYour thoughts on 2014's Timo Tolkki's Avalon album? I would've thought for sure it would be in your worst albums list, but even I forgot about it until now. 
p3851
aVNever finished listening to it actually.  I listened to a couple songs, seemed pretty bad.  I told myself i'd come back to it when I had time and kind of just forgot about it. 
p3852
aVHaha, I've got *Citadel* as my #1 of the album of the year. Looks like we were both fond of it.\u000a\u000aAmazingly, I don't have any major issues with your list. Even the worst albums list is pretty fair in my opinion (except for Delain. How dare you?). I've only got three of the same albums as you in my top 20 list, though, but I can't deny that all of your picks are must-hear for 2014 (except for maybe Edge of Thorns...I never got the appeal). I'll post mine later once this thread loses steam. I'm looking forward to your opinions on my list XD
p3853
aVI assume those other 17 albums are all Japanese.  I'll be disappointed if they aren't. 
p3854
aVI'm sorry to disappoint, then. I've only got 4 Japanese albums in my top 20 (I've got BABYMETAL in my non-power metal list, though). None of them are in my top 10 either, so I feel like I've let you down.\u000a\u000aDon't worry; 2015 will be the year of JPM and only JPM.
p3855
aVSolid list. I really like seeing SA on best-of lists this year, glad they're getting back in the game.
p3856
aVI agree with this list wholeheartedly.
p3857
aVOh man, Grailknights are hilarious. I never expected you to rate SA so high, imo it's a cool album but seriously nothing special.\u000a\u000aJust out of curiosity, did you took a listen to Soen's album? Citadel is a totally fine choice too. In fact, i think there's a bunch of albums that would fit your "TOP NON_POWER METAL ALBUM" category. Good 2014 delivered some really memorable albums.
p3858
aVI actually passed over Soen because I read it has heavy tool vibes going on, and i'm not particularly a fan of Tool. I'll check it out though.
p3859
aVI'd say that's right, even more tool vibes were present in their previous album, imo in this one they manage to rise above tool's shadow. It's a very "melancholic" and mellow album so don't expect a true progressive metal punch.
p3860
aVNow that I've given Noble Beast some time I can definitely climb aboard the hype train happily. Balls-out good power metal album. And what you said about the riffs is bang-on. 
p3861
aVWhat'd you think of Sabaton's new album and Blind Guardian's single? I actually totally agree with you on the Freedom Call album. I've always found them to be fairly mediocre but I was very pleasantly surprised to find out what a solid album it was. There were some great moments and tracks on there.
p3862
aVWe share two albums in the T10. Noble Beast and Skyliner.
p3863
aVHave you heard Solitary Sabred? I just stumbled upon them recently. They are really good 
p3864
aVNo mention of Sabaton? I feel their album was pretty solid or at least Night Witches deserving of a top 3 songs. Good choice of Freedom Call, maybe could have been higher on the list, such a great album. 
p3865
aVI just don't think sabaton is that good.  Mediocre at best for me
p3866
aVI totally agree on Noble Beast. I just heard of them a few days ago in some underappreciated album thread and was totally blown away. Such an incredible album, and it's a huge shame I missed it when it dropped earlier this year.
p3867
aVI'm having a real hard time getting past how buried in the mix the vocals get on a lot of the Noble Beast tracks, at least during the verses. \u000a\u000aI like it, but I want to like it more than I do?
p3868
asVIs it me, or new Orden Ogan album is weak?
p3869
(lp3870
VSuper deluxe mini track review GO!\u000a\u000a**Orden Ogan** - Pointless intro, boring, filler\u000a\u000a**Ravenhead** - Had potential but it's way too long, had it been shorter, it could be a good intro to the album with some good ol' standard meat and potatoes power metal\u000a\u000a**F.E.V.E.R** - Cool song, i hate the chorus but that's probably just me, it also irritates me that they repeat the chorus so many times in particular in the slow beginning of the song. It's actually a good song, some good variations in the middle.\u000a\u000a**The Lake** - Nothing special, average song, guitars seem to be buried in the chorus.\u000a\u000a**Evil Lies in Every Man** - Sick song. Well executed.\u000a\u000a**Here at the End of the World** - Gosh darn i like this song but i can't figure out who is singing as guest on this one. It's so familiar... Possibly a crowd chanting style of song.\u000a\u000a**A Reason To Give** - a shit, i cannot. A ballad style song, it's boring. I yawned. Next.\u000a\u000a**Deaf Among The Blind** - Fast ripping song. It's another good song.\u000a\u000a**Sorrow Is Your Tale** - Hmmm, is that Cans? I think I hear him here... Might have spend too many time listening to some black metal in the past two weeks. Sweet intro to kick off the tune leading to the strongest chorus in the album. Awesome song to play live.\u000a\u000a**In Grief And Chains** - Pointless, I don't know what this is.\u000a\u000a**Too Soon** - Pointless outro, boring, filler\u000a\u000aAll performances are good, there are no weak links, the vocalist is definitely above average. It's a decent album but I am seeing quite a few reviews online praising how amazing this album is. Cmon it's just the typical power metal songs that heavily relies on the catchiness and quality of chorus and such stuff, which are the best part of the album.\u000a\u000aAll this was based on my first listening, I don't see this growing on me over time, so this is just an album with some bad moments and some good songs. Sorrow Is Your Tale stands out.
p3871
aV&gt; Here at the End of the World - Gosh darn i like this song but i can't figure out who is singing as guest on this one. It's so familiar... Possibly a crowd chanting style of song.\u000a\u000aJust listened to it (haven't purchased the album yet). I'm like 80% sure it's the vocalist from Grave Digger just based on his voice (I'm getting way too good at recognizing singers, I feel like some sort of idiot savant). I forget his name offhand because I hate Grave Digger.\u000a\u000a^EDIT: Chris Boltendahl. Thanks Google.\u000a\u000aThis song is really good though.
p3872
aV&gt; because I hate Grave Digger\u000a\u000aWhat :O
p3873
aVWell, I can't say I don't understand why. Musically they can be pretty fantastic, but Boltendahl's voice is definitely an acquired taste. It took me  a number of years to get into it. And even now I still prefer [Rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fg-lbNhHfM), which is made up of some former Grave Digger members but has, in my opinion, vastly superior vocals.
p3874
aVOh yeah that's him alright, was to lazy to look up.
p3875
aVI see many people saying that and they've got the right to say it. But for me, this album is incredible and delivers. Just as I expected. Well, maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit because Orden Ogan is nearly one of my favourite Power Metal bands but I love that album.
p3876
aVNeed to get my hands on it, will do soon. I'm sad to hear it's disappointing, though. Fever and Ravenhead were sounding good... though Ravenhead got a lot of hate.
p3877
aVDefinitely you. I was meaning to make a post saying how incredibly great it is. For me, the album is better than anything in 2014(and it was a good year) and best of Orden Ogan yet(and  their previous albums are great). There isn't one weak moment on the album for me.\u000a\u000aEvil Lies In Every Man, F.E.V.E.R and Here At The End Of The World are highlights, being a bit more awesome then the rest.\u000a\u000aEarly candidate for album of the year for me.
p3878
aVYeah, I was somewhat disappointed. Ravenhead is good, F.EV.E.R is okay but I don't like it that much. I like The Lake, Sorrow Is Your Tale and Too Soon, but everything else I found rather boring. Most of the tracks from To the End are far better than the best on Ravenhead, in my opinion.
p3879
aVI think it's actually really good. Certainly the first 5-6 songs are the best. I didn't think it was weak at all though. I'm not sure it was as good as To the End, but I liked it a lot.
p3880
aVWas waiting for a thread like this. I told myself I would try not to compare it to the masterpiece that is "To The End" but... not even that will salvage it. F.E.V.E.R is great, Ravenhead is almost great but pointlessly long. Evil Lies in Every Man is fantastic and Here at the End of the World is worth a few listens. \u000a\u000aOverall it's meh. After To The End I knew this album wouldn't be an improvement. I'm glad I have some new songs to throw on the ol' playlist but I won't be listening to it on repeat for years like To The End.
p3881
aVIt's you. I think the album is great. But hey that's the beauty of music. It's very subjective. What you hear is different to what I hear. =) 
p3882
aVYeah, its pretty mediocre. Sabaton fans will be blowing their nut over it though. 
p3883
aVSabaton fanboy. Absolutely loved To The End. Got Ravenhead at 0.01on the 16th and listened to it like 5 times since. Really disappointed.
p3884
aVI like F.E.V.E.R alot and Ravenhead is okay, but the rest of the album is pretty much meh sadly. And i'm a Sabaton fan too by the way.
p3885
aVSabaton fan here, i agree, its a massive letdown. I think i will stick to "To The End"\u000a\u000aA much better album in my opinion

p3896

VThis is great. Thanks.
p3898
aVDark Moor's earlier stuff with Elisa is their best, to me. She's got a voice unlike any other! Songs like [Beyond the Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eILXWl8RfxY), [The Night of the Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuF8R7UgEIs), [Maid of Orleans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5Ni-wrFwVs), and [Silver Lake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbol84KDqb8) are some of my favorites. 
p3899
aVI agree, the early Dark Moor albums with Elisa are among my favorite albums, and for some reason i just cant get into Dark Moor once she left.  Her voice was so unique and refreshing for a female singer in power metal.

p3906
aVThat and Dawn of Victory as far as I am aware.
p3907
aV&gt; I did like this guys performance of the song, though.\u000a\u000aI was agreeing with you, but then...
p3908
aVWhy would you fucking post it if you don't like it...
p3909
aVIt is a fad on this subreddit lately to make fun of Pellek for some reason.  I don't really get it either. 
p3910
aVIt is a fad on this subreddit to get mad at people for not liking pellek lately for some reason. I don't get why people like him either.
p3911
aVThere are a ton of singers I don't like, but you don't see me posting their stuff every fucking day just to say how much they suck. It's not your dislike that's the fad it's the insistence to make the rest of us aware of how much you dislike the guy.  \u000a\u000aWe get it! Now let's get back to posting good stuff. 
p3912
aVPeople post things, people say they don't like the those things or vice versa depending on their preferences. Thus is the flow of the internet.\u000a\u000aAlso people are facetiously negative about this guy. He's good in some ways. As someone previously said it's something about the punchability of his face and his technique sounding a bit phoned-in/aggravating, as well as his personality in comments/on videos...
p3913
aV&gt;People post things, people say they don't like the those things or vice versa depending on their preferences. Thus is the flow of the internet.\u000a\u000aBut what's the point of posting it every day just so the same four people could say how much they dislike it. It's unnecessary and is lowering the quality of this subreddit. Just like that time a few months ago when we had three posts a day telling us how awesome Keldian was. It shouldn't be encouraged. 
p3914
aVBecause people want other people to understand why they dislike it. Freedom of speech. Reddit. Discussion.\u000a\u000aAlso I would spam this subreddit with stuff if I think people should notice. It should be encouraged because I want to hear good stuff. The more it appears here, the more likely I will be to hear it.\u000a\u000aAlso I didn't minus anything you said.\u000a\u000aAlso, quality of a subreddit is entirely subjective. I actually expect people to argue about opinions on bands here, that's like people arguing over band genres on wikipedia. But this is more joking around about Pellek and his somewhat awkward stuff on youtube.\u000a\u000aThe main reason is that he seems to sing like he does because it's 'cool' to sing really high. Not because it helps put across a theme of a song (which is why it fits in power metal). \u000a\u000aIt reminds me of when I was younger I used to listen to songs just because they had shredding all over the place, and ignored ones that didn't. (Missed out on a lot of awesome Sonata Arctica songs early on due to this.)
p3915
aVHe's not good, but I like it. He makes me happy. \u000a\u000aBesides, when a song is in his range, he seems more comfortable.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmAizGfp12Q
p3916
aVIs there some sort of inside joke I don't know of here?
p3917
aVNot really. Just some dude who enjoys metal music like us all.
p3918
aVMade it 1:17 before I got annoyed. Getting better!\u000a\u000aDoes he ever put up what type of equipment he uses? I'm tempted to get the same condenser mic and record my own versions of this stuff.
p3919
aVSo 30 seconds of his singing? The moment he attempted to hit the initial high notes I noped right out of there. It is just hollow.... There is no feeling or soul behind his singing. It seems like he doesn't have the passion that should be there. 
p3920
aVYou could try a Guitar Center if you are in the US and if they have pro audio
p3921

I had assumed they were German at first and I'm like, "wtf, swehrd? what a silly name")
p3927
aVAlmost!\u000a\u000aYour first assumption is more correct, I think you've mixed Å and Ä with each other.\u000a\u000aI am curious though. The swedish word for sword is svärd. I am wonder if this is some old form of spelling, I do know that Swärdh is a surname, but that is all.

VThis is a collaboration between different musicians from the UK, the US, and Estonia. I did the vocals/lyrics. It was a lot of fun and we're looking forward to collaborating again. Hope you guys like it and please send feedback.
p4027
aVYou asked for feedback, here it is.  \u000a  \u000a1. Intro. The opening riff is very power slave-y. Muted and... compartmentalized I guess. There's nothing wrong with that sound, but I would personally prefer some more sound than the very short silent spots with only the somewhat shallow drums filling the void. **Don't get me wrong**, the riff is good and probably works for a lot of people, but I think it's kind of bare.  \u000a  \u000a2. Verse. I really like the riff. Some more exploration of harmonics *might* help flesh it out to make more catchy. Your voice is very well suited to power. It has the quite rare quality of being powerful and high without sounding forced. With more work and some editing I could see it being very recognizable and incredibly strong.  \u000a  \u000a3. Chorus. I like the lyrical theme, and the whole segments seems to flow naturally from the bridge. It's actually catchy in its own right, and with higher production quality I could easily see myself humming this.  \u000a  \u000a4. Conclusion. Right now, it sounds like a very formulaic power demo. **And that's good**. For improvement I'd suggest amping up the bass, since I like the underlying line but I have to actively listen to hear it. Also - work on exploring guitar harmonics and edit your singing a bit. I'm not saying your voice is bad, in fact - it's GOOD; but for this to be a better song, you need to make it a bit cleaner and more full.  \u000a  \u000a**TL;DR**  \u000aGood stuff. Keep it up \u005cm/
p4028
aVThanks for the feedback! I only wrote the vocals, so I appreciate your ideas regarding tone and delivery.

p4033
asVGuitarists of /r/PowerMetal, what are some good pickups/gear for particular sounds?
p4034
(lp4035
VPersonally I enjoy playing through passive pickups (Seymour Duncan 51) in general when compared to active pickups (EMG). Passive pick ups tend to give the guitar  a more unique sound where as you can typically make all EMGs sound the same in most guitars. Personally i own an LTD with active pickups and an Ibanez with passive pickups so I can switch between when i wanna change sounds. 
p4036
aV:-O\u000a\u000aHi, guitar twin.\u000a\u000aI also play an ESP LTD with Seymour Duncan 51s. I love it.\u000a\u000aI'm not as good a guitarist as I am a singer or drummer but I like to mess around and pretend I know what I'm doing.
p4037
aVIt's all personal preference, and you can get a good power metal tone with a lot of variety equipment. \u000a\u000aPersonally I find that Engl amps  have a really good modern Power Metal sound(Invader / SE). I know Hammerfall use Engl Invader both live and in studio. In general the Engl amps I have owned have had an easy to dial European power metal tone. \u000a\u000aI good mid output pickup like Dimazrio EVO / Activator go well with it. \u000a\u000aGuitar wise what ever you prefer should be okay, I'm not personally a fan of B.C. Rich non US guitars, but like I said its all preference. 
p4038
aVDon't get too wrapped up on recommendations. Just test out different pickups, effects, etc. and choose the ones that you resonate the most with. I like Ibanez and ESP guitars, Laney and Blackstar amps, boss pedals, etc. I'm still exploring pickups though, because I've only used actives so far. 
p4039
aVAmps are my main area of interest. I have a Vox DA15, but I know literally nothing about them.
p4040
aVThe thing about all these guitars, amps, and pedals are that there are way too many extraneous variables to objectively compare one thing to another. Your best bet is to bring your own guitar into a store and test out the amps you're thinking of. That's why pickups are hard for me to compare.

aVPosted about this ad nauseum since we've had a couple of other UTA threads lately, but I'm a huge, huge, huge fan. And I don't typically like female-fronted bands.\u000a\u000aBrittney really *knows* how to sing, so I really appreciate that, but I hate the way she sounds on this album. She's fantastic live though, like 100x better than on the albums.
p4085
aVI appreciate that this female-fronted band is just that.  A band with a female singer.  They don't play off of that aesthetic (cough, Nightwish), they don't sexualize her at all (cough, Epica), she's just a member of the band who's a woman.  \u000a\u000aAnd she's a pretty good singer.  She just needs work on using expression in her singing.  Once she stops singing straight tones and starts adding more emotion, she'll be unstoppable.  That takes time, though, and practice; I believe their next album, or the one after that, she'll really begin to shine.

aVCan't view those videos either. Perhaps they are US only?

p4109
(lp4110
VIn terms of the CSS, I have enjoyed some changes but am bothered by others.  What has been done recently, in terms of making everything smaller, including the background and some spacing between comments, have made the subreddit look very messy and incosistant.  It'd be nice to see this subreddit resized to proper subreddit sized like every other one, including the currently cut-off background.  Other things, such as the sidebar and the upvote/neutral/downvote colors, have been changed in positive ways.\u000a\u000aEDIT: In terms of the background, maybe removing it is a valid thing.  Backgrounds are very iffy, especially for forums and such.  Maybe someone who is any decent at design can come up with a theme for the place, specifically in terms of the post layout.  See /r/Overwatch, /r/Smashbros, and /r/CodAW (I'm so sorry) as examples.\u000a\u000aEDIT 2: Keep aspects of the theme consistant.  At the moment, the "distinguished mod post" colors and sticky colors are different.  I imagine it would be a good idea to keep those colors consistant.  The stickied post color should probably be different than other posts as well, rather than just being a bolded version of the same (or very similar) color.\u000a\u000aI would not mind taking part in the weekly release threads.  Are the releases mostly grabbed from Metal Archives?  What other sources might be used?\u000a\u000aRedoing the Essential Albums list, as I have already said, is never a bad thing.  Either more people come to an agreement before and the list becomes more "perfected", or nothing changes and there was nothing negative about the discussion.\u000a\u000aI would definitely be up for album discussions.  I have thought about them in the past, and would definitely be willing to help keep  these on track with the new releases.  I am wondering if there is a way to get 2 stickied posts?  Maybe with modifications or a CSS edit?\u000a\u000aIn terms of rules, the only thing that I would appreciate is if we officially endorsed (Band - Song Title) as opposed to (Song Title - Band) to keep things organized and to avoid confusion.\u000a\u000aI haven't been around too much the past week between work, school, being sick, and very tired, but soon I'll start posting more and start coming up with ideas for the subreddit.

I won't take it personal I was just messing around. As far as I'm concerned the CSS is for all four of us to mess around with. 
p4114
aVWhen you "distinguish" your comment as a moderator, it turn yours name above your post to green for the purpose of, ehm, distinguishing it from others.  Usually only used for more "official" posts.  I would imagine keeping this color and the color of stickied posts the same would make the most sense.  On top of this, the stickied post color right now is the same color as other posts in the subreddit.  The only difference is the stickied post is bolded.  \u000a\u000aMaybe toy around with the colors and see what stickied/distinguished color set works best with the subreddit.  I think green would be fine, but toy around with whatever you like and see what looks good and stands out.
p4115
aVOne minor problem I see is that in the upper left it looks like it says "POWERMETALP"
p4116
aVLooks like "powermetalpo" to me.
p4117
aVWhat the hell. Why am I not seeing this stuff on my monitor
p4118
aVFor reference, [this is what my banner looks like](http://i.imgur.com/gCFufjd.jpg). Maybe it's a browser or resolution issue? I'm using firefox, and at 1920x1080.
p4119
aVThe only source I use for the weekly release threads is Metal Archives. 
p4120
aVI made a revised banner, made the logo smaller so it fits better, changed Polaris artwork with higher resolution one and made the wolf on Pariah's Child cover a bit smaller as well so he fits nicely.\u000a\u000a**[Updated banner](http://i.imgur.com/WVkvvoN.png).**
p4121
aVWow thank you very much! Great work
p4122
aVI made self post icons as well. Check them out and let me know if any change is necessary.

p4123
aVThanks for making these! I put in the dragon 2 button, and we can see what people think of that.
p4124
aVExemplary work, Warrior. Enjoy the gold
p4125
aVHoly shit, thank you, but to be honest i don't even know what can i do with it. I'm going now to check what the hell can i do with it. Thank you again.
p4126
aVHooooly shit... awesome.
p4127
aVOverall this subreddit has been alright. Usually when a popular band releases something, we'll get a flood of band posts for that band because people remember "Ah! These guys exist!", but after a few months, the posts die down
p4128
aVI might sound like a total douche for suggesting this, but how about a wiki page for band writeups? I'm not the only one doing them, and while there are some in the essential albums list, many others are lost as soon as they're off the front page. I know /u/REkTeR did one of Heavenly not so long ago, and someone did Iron Mask recently as well.
p4129
aVNot douchey at all, I can make that this afternoon if another mod doesn't get to it first.
p4130
aVTo give an update: I got the wiki page up with a link in the sidebar and have included a number of articles. I'll get more in there soon. Since some articles might be difficult to track down, if anyone has any to point out, feel free to do so.\u000a\u000aI couldn't find the Iron Mask one you brought up.
p4131
aVI believe [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2rfx37/a_guideanalysis_of_iron_savior/) might be the one he was talking about.
p4132
aVThanks! Not sure why that didn't turn up in search.
p4133
aVSweet, nice work! Just a heads up, though - the top article under my name says 2014, should be 2015. Just for the next time you're up in there editing stuff.
p4134
aVFixed! I guess an unconscious part of me wanted it to still be 2014, despite Blind Guardian's new album.
p4135
aVLol, I was well into 2013 before I stopped saying 2010
p4136
aVI went all out and made many changes tonight in the stylesheet.  A big one, and maybe controversial, is removing the background image.  I am hoping people prefer it this way, although I did save it and can put it back if people want that.\u000a\u000aThe reason for removing it is that it was very messy with too much going on, making it distracting and ugly, in my opinion.  Most subreddits don't have a background image, and if they do, it is a lot more simple than that.  I do not think it is necessary, but again, the choice is yours: the community's!\u000a\u000aOther little changes here and there; if something bothers you or if something is off in the changes, make sure to say something!
p4137
aVLooks much better without the background.  My only gripe is that I know have an annoying dotted line between the header and comments.   Does anyone else have this showing up?
p4138
aV[deleted]
p4139
aVI'll get rid of that; I was testing it out.
p4140
aVI liked the background dragon but I get your point.  \u000aYou could lower the image's intensity so it doesn't stand out but is still slightly visible?  \u000a\u000aThat said. Things look very clean now so it's probably best to not bring back the background image. I'm ok with whatever you guys think is best.  \u000a\u000aAnother thing I'd like to mention. There's something weird going on with the banner in combination with RES.  \u000aHere's an image of what the "menu-bar" looks like here compared to /r/funny (It's cut off on the left side)  \u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/0LzOtDz.png  \u000a(Also there's a one-pixel wide blue outline on the left and bottom of the powermetal banner)  \u000a  \u000aThat is all. Thanks for the hard work. :)\u000aYou guys are doing a great job so far.
p4141
aVSo your header is cut off that much?  I installed RES to see what you were talking about, but mine reaches to the end of the page.  Is it fixed now?  Are you zoomed in your browser at all?\u000a\u000aAlso, I got rid of the blue border on the left and changed the bottom one to a black one.
p4142
aVIt's still cut off.  \u000aHere's a screenshot from a different computer and it has the same problem.  \u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/ux9E2g3.jpg  \u000aIt only gets cut off in /r/powermetal .  \u000aBoth Google Chrome and Firefox have this problem for me. I'm not zoomed in.  \u000aI don't mind if it stays like this but I thought that if I have this problem, others might have it too and it's only on this subreddit.  \u000aThanks btw.
p4143
aVOh!  I finally see what you mean now.  I will figure it out.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Done.
p4144
aVYup it's fixed.  \u000aGreat work :D
p4145
aVI think the background was slightly too intrusive, but I am still in favor of having something (besides the up/downswords) that makes the page look like /r/powermetal when you're not at the very top.
p4146
aVDo you have any ideas for something like that?
p4147
aVWell, someone mentioned the Smash Brothers subreddit at /r/smashbros and I thought that was a good example.
p4148
aVI would appreciate any time an album comes out there could be an official self post made for discussion of it.\u000a\u000aI'd also agree a re-doing of the essentials list by the community should be done if enough people want it re-visited.\u000a\u000aI don't have any major gripes with the way the sub looks (great job /u/mushmancat) except I would say ditch having Joakim as our self-text icon lest we are accused of favouritism :) \u000a\u000aMaybe the background needs an update, depending what people think?
p4149
aVWhat do we want for a self post icon?
p4150
aVI did like that dragon...
p4151
aVThe dragon image that you had before Joakim.
p4152
aVMjölnir, the hammer of Thor?
p4153
aVI agree with getting rid of Joakim as the self-text icon\u000a\u000aLike, it was funny for a while, and pretty fitting while the 2014 election results were posted, but I don't think it should be a permanent fixture 
p4154
aVPlease find a better self post icon.
p4155
aVWhen it comes to the essential albums, will we be looking at bands as a whole, going album by album to decide which one is the "essential one" or are we going to rely on superfans to step up and give us a rundown on which one(s) are recommended and essential?\u000a\u000aAlso, I am kicking around a discussion thread idea, but held off this weekend as I felt it would have been lost in the shuffle with what occurred.
p4156
aVWe can talk about the process when we get to it, but it'll probably be based more around albums than bands (while keeping in mind that there are some bands that definitely need to be on there).
p4157
aVI approve of everything.
p4158
aVI think that all the changes so far have been good and I thank all the mods for their work. Regarding the discussion posts, would they be accessible from the wiki page after they have died down? I think that would be a nice resource to have.
p4159
aVGreat idea - I'll definitely set this up!
p4160
aVI love the CSS work, especially the new font and tidier look to the right-hand bar. It looks much better with the essential albums being a single link too. \u000a\u000aIf we redo the essential albums list, I think each person should be able to vote 2 albums: 1 is what they consider the best PM album ever, and the other 1 is what they choose is the best from the old list. That way we don't get too spammed with album suggestions, and the merit of the old list is still honored. Each band can only have 1 album represent them, etc. 
p4161
aVSounds great, I'm looking forwards to the Beyond the Red Mirror Discussion Thread.\u000a\u000aKeep up the good work!
p4162
aVI'm not much of a fan of the CSS changes, I gotta say.\u000a\u000aAlso, since you know Optimus Rhyme, were you maybe on the Nintendo NSider Forums back in the day?
p4163
aVYeah. I have some fond memories of that place!
p4164
aVAny new thoughts now?
p4165
aVThe CSS work is great! Are we going to host any AMA like the Keldian one here on the subreddit? 
p4166
aVHopefully - it depends on band interest. If you have a way of contacting a band that might be interested, feel free to reach out to them.
p4167
aVAccording to my tags:\u000a\u000a* /u/ametalfellow is a member of Viathyn\u000a* /u/mshabooboo is the vocalist of Lords of the Trident\u000a* /u/ColeR832 played with PelleK\u000a\u000aAlso, /u/Hammerforce used to post his own stuff in this subreddit. I haven't seen him in a while though.
p4168
aVMUSHMAN, YOU SON OF A BITCH! WHERE DID JOAKIM GO?!
p4169
aVhe was too metal
p4170
aVCan we finally get a fix for the redundancy in the sidebar?\u000a\u000a"I mean given custom flair, which is tantamount to the same thing."
p4171
aVPut in some new text. I also took the opportunity to reflect that anyone who makes quality contributions to the sub on a frequent basis will be rewarded with flair, rather than just submitting links.
p4172
aVJust an idea, since we will never agree on the sidebar albums, maybe have links to the individual lists of flaired members, for instance?
p4173
aVWe can probably do something like that.
p4174
aVI like what they are doing in /r/Metal with the weekly spotlight albums.  We could do something like that to sort of induct albums onto the essentials list.  \u000a\u000aAlso the new page looks great!
p4175
aVNow that the essential albums list is moved off the sidebar, we have more room. It'd be great if we could label each album with a few descriptive words / subgenres to help guide newbies.
p4176
aVI noticed in the Top section that there are no numbers next to the post score to show the post's rank. 
p4177
aVI just messaged the mods about this, after seeing Elan leaked for a second time, but i'd also like to ask the community about this.\u000a\u000aHow would you feel if we banned posting early/leaked songs? If an artist shares it themselves it would be fine, it would just have to be labeled as WIP or something similar depending on the state of the song, but if it was a leak it would be deleted and the poster given a warning and after repeated offenses (case-by-case basis, if someone constantly post either the same song or other songs that are leaked) they would eventually get temp banned.\u000a\u000aIt wouldn't be for long, just a few weeks at first and rising if they keep it up.
p4178
aVMy stance is this: direct links to *any* torrents/torrent sites are not allowed. Links to sites such as youtube/soundcloud are allowed. If content is posted there that an artist or label doesn't want, they have very easy means of taking it down - power that they usually don't have on torrent sites. I don't think it's the place of the mods to forbid links like this: whether or not people want to post and listen to leaks is up to each individual, and I don't think one person's view should determine the actions of another. As I said, if the song owner has an issue with a song being online, they can deal with it at the source.

aVI have not been able to get into Symphony X at all.  Does anyone have any suggestions on where to start?  Memorable vocals (in terms of style, execution, and melody lines) are most important to me.
p4196
aVTry the second album. The damnation game. About the memorable vocals, it doesn't get more memorable than Russell Allen.
p4197

aVHas there been any suggestion on where they're going with this new album...any ideas on themes and stuff?
p4201
aVSymphony X are one of those rare bands that are actually MUCH better live. I saw them a couple years back with Iced Earth. I went for IE, thinking only meh of Symphony X at the time.....holy shit....they blew IE out of the water and gained my respect and money in the process.

aVYep, the dude is definitely fucking amazing, I admire how consistent he is, very few singers can sing like this and maintain the same quality over the years.
p4283
aVI love this guy. His voice is one of the few that can move me to tears (ask the guys from Viathyn that frequent this sub, we were all sobbing manly tears during the last 70K cruise during *Paradise Lost*).\u000a\u000aI was at a show in Los Angeles a few years back and his old voice teacher was there (towards the end of *The Odyssey* they stopped the song and he pointed him out. Guy was quite old and in a wheelchair and it was an AMAZING moment, going to see if anyone got it on video). He said that Michael Romeo is tough on him, but his vocal coach was the person that made him who he is today - that he continually pushed him and he basically owes everything to him.\u000a\u000aI just really want to meet his old voice teacher. That man worked some miracles.
p4284
aVGod dammit shit cock sucker fuck!!!\u000a\u000aI thought that was some bullshit when they said Russell was touring with TSO(East) this year! HE DIDN'T PLAY IN ATLANTA!\u000a\u000aI even brought my Paradise Lost vinyl to get signed ;_;\u000a\u000a
p4285
aVThe way they split up their tours is very strange, they have an east coast and west coast band with completely different lineups. Russell only does the east coast run, which apparently doesn't include Atlanta? I had to go to Indiana last year to see Russell with TSO because for some reason Chicago is part of the west coast tour.\u000a\u000aGot free tickets to the TSO show in Salt Lake City this year with Jeff Scott Soto and all of the vocalists paled in comparison to Russell.
p4286
aVNo, they played in Atlanta, but Russell didn't play that day. :(\u000a\u000aWe even had front row this year by some miracle. I was so pumped to see Russell up close. Fourth (?) song on the set, lights are dark, I see the curly mane and beard! IT'S GOTTA BE RUSSELL! Lights turn on.... aaaaaaannnnd it's the blonde British dude...\u000a\u000aThe disappointment was so real...
p4287
aVNathan James? Yeah, he was on the west coast tour. I'm assuming you got the west coast lineup. Who was the lead guitarist/band leader? Was it Al Pitrelli or Chris Caffrey?
p4288
aVChris! I just don't get it ;_;
p4289
aVWow...that IS really weird! Maybe he had to take some days off to record vocals for the Symphony X album!
p4290
aV\u005c&gt;or Romanov
p4291
aVRussell is hands down the best singer in all of heavy music. I wish more people knew of his brilliance. In my opinion, he's every bit as good (or better) than metal gods like Dickinson, Dio, and Halford. 
p4292
aVwhoa there, have you forgotten about our lord and savior Hansi?
p4293
aVHansi vs. Russell...FIGHT!
p4294
aVI love Dio, love Hansi, love Roy Khan... but I fucking worship Russell Allen.
p4295
aVHe is absolutely the best prog singer ever and one of the best in all of metal.
p4296
aV[The quality is pretty meh on this but it also shows how amazing he is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8ooO6sSwrY)
p4297
aVHe probably got good advice on how to growl his voice without killing it. Growling is potentially dangerous

aVI actually hadn't heard of him before, sounds great for sure.\u000aBut he's no Roy Khan...\u000a\u000aKhan is god.

Avantasia is a metal opera band, made up of a bunch of different musicians from various metal and power metal groups.  Check out the song "The Scarecrow," by them. I've been digging that one lately.

asVDiscovering Power Metal: Avantasia (Part 2: 2010 - 2013)
p4366
(lp4367
VI do really like your writeups, and while it all comes down to subjectivity in the end, I feel like I need to try and tear this one apart because I really love this era of Avantasia\u000a\u000a&gt; In 2010, Avantasia went and did something awesome: They released two albums simultaneously. \u000a\u000aI will agree this is awesome. In fact, Tobi proudly touted the fact that there were no boring interludes or tracks with silence (though I think he missed the intro on "The Wicked Symphony"; not that it's boring, but more that it's sort of a bombastic intro)\u000a\u000a&gt; "Blizzard on a Broken Mirror" is another forgettable track\u000a\u000aI would argue there's not a single forgettable track on any of these three albums, but this is one of the best. Give it another shot.\u000a\u000a&gt; The album is closed with ballad-like "The Edge".\u000a\u000aThis write-up doesn't do this song justice. It is easily one of the best Avantasia songs ever, and shows how incredible of a singer Tobi is. This is possibly my favourite song from the album (though other than "Crestfallen", they're all pretty much perfect.\u000a\u000a&gt; This album opens with "Stargazers", featuring Jorn, Allen, and Kiske. Initially, the song sounds very promising. When you compare this song to "The Wicked Symphony", "Stargazers" simply does not deliver.\u000a\u000aThis track is every bit as good as "The Wicked Symphony". Not sure if you've seen the band live, but this song absolutely kills live. It definitely improved my appreciation of the song.\u000a\u000a&gt; Then we get to a weird ass song. "Death is Just a Feeling" is a creepy-vibe song fronted by Jon Oliva. Like with "Scales of Justice" on The Wicked Symphony, the the voice keeps the song from being enjoyable, at least to me.\u000a\u000aTime to buy some Savatage albums ;) Jon Oliva is a god!\u000a\u000a&gt; If you didn't have enough ballads yet, the album ends with one: "Journey to Arcadia", with Allen and Bob Catley. Dammit, I'm tired of these ballads!\u000a\u000aI sympathize with the ballads comment, and I do agree that the second half of Angel of Babylon drags a bit, but "Journey To Arcadia" is one of the stronger tracks on the record. Really classic stuff, especially Bob Catley's performance.\u000a\u000a&gt; ALLRIGHT KIDS, it's time for Avantasia's best album!!!\u000a\u000aClose, but it's not The Scarecrow :P\u000a\u000a&gt; Then we have "Sleepwalking", the song that spearheaded the promotion of the album.\u000a\u000aThis is only partially true. Although it is the "single" from the record, "Invoke The Machine" was the first song available to hear from the record.\u000a\u000a&gt; Which is baffling, to say the least, because this is a pop song. At the time, it definitely turned me off and lowered my expectations for the album greatly. The song attempts very hard to be dramatic, but that kinda works against it. Both Sammet and Yang's vocals are commendable, but this song just simply isn't good.\u000a\u000aThis one is a tough one. I'm at the point where I think Tobi genuinely likes messing with his fans and putting songs like this (and "What Kind of Love") on his albums. For what it's worth, I think this isn't as good as some of his other songs in this vein, although I do like it a lot. I have no problem with anyone hating this song though.\u000a\u000a&gt; It's not an Avantasia album without a ballad. "What's Left of Me" takes care of business. This is Eric Martin's only appearance for Avantasia. Too bad for him that he was featured on a forgettable ballad. \u000a\u000aAt this point it looks like every song is my "favourite" song, but "What's Left Of Me" is again, easily one of my favourite Avantasia tracks. Eric Martin absolutely kills it here. \u000a\u000a&gt; The album closes with ballad-like "The Great Mystery", being supported by Catley, Turner, and Byford. The song is 10 minutes long. I can't recommend a 10-minute long ballad. I just can't. The song does see some heavier segments, but only slightly, and they're few and far between. I bet that it's an appropriate album closer from an artistic viewpoint.\u000a\u000aThis song is a completely epic masterpiece. It's an appropriate close to an insanely monolithic record. I really dig it.\u000a\u000a&gt; But all I want is some power meturls, dammit!\u000a\u000aI think this is where our differences lie. I will fully admit that power metal Tobi is best (particularly in Edguy), but you have to appreciate that he's just not at that point in his career anymore. 
p4368
aVGreat reply, bro!\u000a\u000aYeah I guess it comes down to my tastes being pretty narrow (and not favoring ballads much). So by definition I'm probably way more critical than some might say I should be.\u000a\u000aI've never seen any power metal band live, actually. I'd like to, but NOBODY I know likes PM in the slightest and I don't feel like going Han Solo style.
p4369
aV&gt; ALLRIGHT KIDS, it's time for Avantasia's best album\u000a&gt; The Mystery of Time (2013)\u000a\u000ahttps://i.imgur.com/HC59p.gif
p4370
aVPretty much flawless too.
p4371
aVYou're not sorry. &gt;:|\u000a\u000aI'm not surprised Angel Of Babylon is the worst album. I think it's an absolute massive piece of turd. It's like he wrote Wicked Symphony and then decided it wasn't enough and did another album that basically copies the first one but it sucks. Invoke The Machine is indeed a powerhouse.\u000a\u000aWhat band will be next in the criticizing block?
p4372
aVHmm, I'm really into Pagan's Mind right now, so probably that. I think I'm gonna focus on my favorite release post for February for now, though.
p4373
aVScratch that, I just got my hands on Noble Beast's debut album and holy shiiiiiiit. I'm doing that one next.
p4374
aVWow, I can't believe you're only hearing Noble Beast now...
p4375
aVReading this was experiencing one favorite song after another being shot down. [sigh...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy3dIicSI_0)\u000a\u000aOf special note, Wastelands, Blizzard on a Broken Mirror, Down in the Dark, Alone I remember, and Sleepwalking are all fantastic songs in my book.
p4376
aVIt seems like we appreciate the exact opposite sides of Avantasia :p\u000a\u000a
p4377
aVI do agree that The Mystery of Time is the best of the albums, so there's that at least!
p4378
aVAw. I liked the Jorn version of Promised Land\u000a\u000aOverall, it's a nice run-through and Avantasia is one of my favorite power metal bands
p4379
aVThere's a version of Promised Land without Jorn?

aVSabaton snubbed yet again!
p4414
aVGiven it's the release month for a new album (a rare occurence), and they did an AMA, it's not too bad. And if the subreddit is going to circlejerk around bands, it's nice that at least one of them can produce top tier songwriting.
p4415
aVWhile I think it's true, and this place ends up being BG circle jerk sometimes, that's not really a problem. Every genre is going to have its flagship bands, and that's cool. BG is by far the most popular power metal band; even the people at r/Metal who think power metal is gay will listen to a BG song or two.\u000a\u000aHaving flagship bands is a fine thing; that's why r/Metal has a blacklist (and BG is on it by the way). But r/PowerMetal couldn't have a blacklist (nor does it need one at all), mostly because it would just feature the popular bands (BG, Stratovarius, Sonata Arctica, Lost Horizon, Helloween, Edguy etc) and would basically kill participation on the subreddit (just speculation, altogether we're not too bad at posting the same bands over and over again)
p4416
aVYou're talking about a subreddit where a band released a single song in 2014 and won best song and best singer of 2014. Nope, nothing circlejerky about that, no rampant fanboyism here. 
p4417
aVIts not just BG. BG and Sabaton are the only bands that get any attention here
p4418
aVBG, Sabaton, and a dash of Falconer 
p4419
aVDon't forget some sweet, sweet Keldian
p4420
aVI dislike Falconer. But only the singer.
p4421
aV'Best song' is a category for a single song. If that's the song that people felt was the best released in 2014, why shouldn't they vote for it? Likewise, if people felt that Hansi's live and recorded vocal performances were the best the year had to offer, why shouldn't they vote for it? And don't tell me that that comes anywhere close to awarding 'best lyrics' to Sabaton in terms of a circlejerk.
p4422
aVEven I think Twilight of the Gods was one of the best songs of the year. And I totally agree that Sabaton shouldn't win any rewards for their lyrics.\u000a\u000aThat said, I wonder how people would feel if I said Jorn was the best vocalist of the year because of those two Pentakill songs he did.
p4423
aVIf that's your opinion, I see nothing wrong with that. People just seem to be annoyed that popular choices are winning a popularity contest.
p4424
aVI wonder how people would feel about the annual awards being determined by some sort of award panel rather than by a community vote. People would lose their chance to participate, but the resulting awards would probably make more sense.
p4425
aVThe awards ultimately are and should be a community-driven event. Having a panel would destroy that, and it would be a symptom of people taking the awards more seriously than they should be. No, we aren't deciding in objective terms which are the best of each category - we're putting things to a popular vote for, hopefully, fun.\u000a\u000aGiven the reaction to this year's awards, my current thoughts are to have two awards (one open to all bands, and one with the most popular bands excluded), and to make everything tied to albums.
p4426
aVYeah that sounds good. And you're absolutely right, people are taking the awards way too seriously, myself included.
p4427

asVBuying Different Formats of Music
p4446
(lp4447
VGet the one that has the most value to you.
p4448
aVThe differences depend on the specific product. For exampe, with Blind Guardian's new albums:\u000a\u000a* There is the standard CD.\u000a\u000a* There is the Digipak with a single bonus track.\u000a\u000a* There is the earbook with two bonus tracks\u000a\u000a* There is a deluxe earbook which also includes a vinyl with alternate mixes for two songs.\u000a\u000a* There are various vinyl versions with a single bonus track.\u000a\u000aDigipaks have a sturdier build than jewelcases, and earbooks are significantly larger and may contain more content.\u000a\u000aUltimately what you get is what has the greatest value to you.
p4449
aVThe only thing I'm confused on is what is the difference between the earbook and digipak versions? Is it one bonus track or is there another difference I am unsure of?
p4450
aVI usually buy digipaks, not a guy for vinyls. Whatever the nicest CD version is, I'll go for that.\u000a\u000aIf I REALLY like them I'll buy the japanese version for the bonuses (although im not sure if Blind Guardian does those...)
p4451
aVI'll buy the standard versions of the CDs, and if the bonus tracks impress me enough, I'll see if I can hunt down a download on itunes or amazon.
p4452
aVI would recommend uncompressed (CDs, for example) for Nightwish and Blind Guardian. Compression like MP3 can take out a lot of the soundstaging. It wouldn't be bad for cheap speakers, but if you get higher-end headphones, you start noticing

asVWhat songs brought you to power metal?
p4468
(lp4469
VOk, this is going to be really weird... but I got into Powermetal via playing a video game.\u000a\u000aSide note - metal isn't 100% my thing. I am an industrial, neofolk, military pop, synthpop guy. Most folks who listen to neofolk like their metal black. And while I like the aesthetics of black metal, I am one of those who doesn't like the vocals. \u000a\u000aWith that in mind...\u000a\u000aGo back... oh 7 years? 8 years? My girlfriend and I are hardcore gamers. We been playing Sacred 2 on the xbox 360. And in the game, Blind Guardian makes an appearance. There's a quest you have to get their instruments, and then there is a cut scene and the band rocks out.\u000a\u000a\u000aMy girlfriend really liked their song, and ordered their album "A Twist in the Myth" which I imported into my mobile and really liked. I know folks call it power metal, but I thought of it as "adventure metal". So I started seeking out other adventure-metal bands and got an appreciation for them - leading to other bands like Kamelot, Dragon Force, etc.
p4470
aVOk, I need some examples of military pop.  I'm intrigued. 
p4471
aVMilitary pop sounds strangely awesome.
p4472
aVMilitary pop! It's high on the snare drum with programming and other instruments. I can recommend a lot of bands and songs for sure.\u000a\u000aLupi Gladius\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2-g7tLXc8U&amp;list=PLdWVaR45bTJE9y0Ilsy9jlLUlvKZkv5B3\u000a\u000aDerniere Volonte (the PREMERE Military pop band, the best)\u000a\u000aThe track that got me into DV and military pop all together:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5XRwEckSaM\u000a\u000aLife's Decay\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDBUyLE_CUA\u000a\u000aDer Feuerkreiner\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXHGTuHLr4c\u000a\u000aAnd for harsher stuff, the more "martial industrial" - you cannot go wrong with In Slaughter Natives \u005cm/ \u005cm/.

aVConsidering how much you bash Sabaton this is hilarious.
p4474
aVWhy is it hilarious?
p4475
aVSee below my friend! :)
p4476
aVDragonforce - Through the Fire and Flames was first for me, but a song that really brought me to power metal was [Edguy - Land of the Miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BciNUFPR4kY).
p4477
aVDragonForce's Through the Fire and Flames introduced me to the genre. After that, I took that opportunity to come over to this subreddit and then I found Sonata Arctica's Gravenimage. It was amazing, but the song that really got me into the genre and made me listen to more of Sonata's stuff was The Cage. That, to me, was my gateway to powermetal. Afterwards, I went ahead to listen to all of their old stuff, new stuff, Edguy, Avantasia, and Helloween.
p4478
aVrhapsody - emerald sword
p4479
aVThe first power metal songs I ever heard were Dawn of Victory by Rhapsody and Wolf and Raven by Sonata Arctica.  I realized power metal was my favorite genre when I heard Kamelot's Epics and Lost Horizon's Awakening the World.
p4480
aVFor me it was early Hammer Fall. Before that I thought there was an equation more melodic=less heavy/fast.\u000a\u000aPower metal opened my eyes, you can be very melodic *and* very fast.
p4481
aVA burned CD of Manowar that had a bunch of their material up to 2002 (Warriors of the World)  while playing D&amp;D. (Thor and Hail and Kill)\u000a\u000aFirst purchased was Hammerfall's Legacy of Kings. So songs like Heeding the Call and At the End of the Rainbow.\u000a\u000aIced Earth's Burning Times is another song I got addicted to after buying a Best Of led me down the road of Power Metal.
p4482
aVTwo genres I like in the background when doing table top RPGing: power metal, and black ambient\u000a
p4483
aVAnswered this before but I think it was either - Sonata Arctica - Don't Say A Word, DragonForce - Heart of a Dragon or Rhapsody - Emerald Sword.
p4484
aVI started listening to power metal in the late 90s/early 2000s during the p2p music stealing boom.  Symphony X - Evolution (the Grand Design) off Audiogalaxy was my go-to song.  Blind Guardian's Somewhere Far Beyond was the first PM album I ever purchased (which I sort of fell into because I actually went to get Seventh Son of Seventh Son but it was out of stock).
p4485
aVAudiogalaxy was awesome back in the day.  I discovered so many bands through it.  I remember setting up like a 6 song queue when it went to bed so it would download over night. 
p4486
aV[deleted]
p4487
aVFucking Wisdom of the Kings was so fucking marvelous the first time I listened, I got so hooked on it that I had to have more! Hence my never dying love for Rhapsody... OF FIRE!
p4488
aVOne hundred fucking percent agree. Silent Dream, Wisdom of the Kings, then Dawn of Victory in that order. First 3 songs of PM I heard.
p4489
aVRain of a Thousand Flames is a fucking masterpiece start to finish.
p4490
aVI believe the first Power Metal band I listened to was Masterplan (I didn't know it was called PM at the time, I just though it was some sweet-ass metal). Then later, Dragonforce's "Through the Fire and the Flames", as well as RoF's "Emerald Sword" triggered me to look for more of the same.
p4491
aVIt was early on in my first semester in college, back in September 2010, I was listening to a metal station on iTunes. The song Mindfeeder by Iron Savior came on, and I thought it was catchy, but never heard the song name, so I typed in some of the lyrics on Google and found it. From there I listened to all of Condition Red, then started looking up other big names in power metal, where I started getting really into Halloween, Gamma Ray, Rhapsody, Blind Guardian, etc. I'm not as into power metal now as I was 4 1/2 years ago, but if I hadn't heard that one song halfway through, my music tastes would definitely be different today.
p4492
aVI think Karma by Kamelot
p4493
aVI think my early childhood exposure to classical music.   It was pretty much the only music in the house growing up.  Had a cool hippy neighbor, keep in mind I was about ten, but would play old Deep Purple, Yes, etc for me.  By the time I started buying my own records, I was a proghead, then metalhead  then just started expanding from there.  
p4494
aVProbably Everything Fades to Gray by Sonata Arctica. At the time I was about 12 or 13 and I only knew Sonata Arctica and Nightwish (specifically Oceanborn) for power metal, but I knew enough that they were my favorite bands. When I discovered that SA brought out a new album, Everything Fades to Gray really caught my attention and from there I just started exploring all their discography and since then branched out to similar bands and more recently trying out some new stuff. Still a lot to discover, but so far so good.
p4495
aVChildhood nostalgia made me like power metal.\u000a\u000aLong time ago I was at a friend's house. We were playing on the computer, and he wanted to put on some music. He took out "King of the Nordic Twilight" by Luca Turilli on a cassette tape and put it on. I fell in love instantly, because the whole aesthetic reminded of the golden years of early 90's. The cover art was like from an old video game, and in fact the fast and cheery melodies reminded me of old NES games of my childhood like the Mega Man series. I actually thought then, that the album was made in the early 90's, because it was a tape. (I found out later that it was a pirated copy)\u000a\u000aAnd today I still like power metal. The innocent fantasy adventure style still endears me, even though mostly I like my music more progressive and with a deeper subject matter.
p4496
aVFunny story, Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows growing up (still a guilty pleasure of mine) and the soundtrack to it is pretty Power Metal-ish. I remember listening to Manowar, loving the power and cheese of the music and it reminded me of Power Rangers. I liked Metal long before that but Power Metal is only a recent discovery of mine and it's quickly becoming one of my favorite metal genres.
p4497
aVIt was a long time ago, it was a Helloween song, can't remember which one I heard first, probably Future World. 
p4498
aVHmm... the first song was Blind Guardian - Curse Of Feanor, but then what really hooked me were Glory to the Brave and Legacy of Kings by HammerFall (albums)
p4499
aVIve been getting into blind guardian lately, but the android store doesnt have a damn quarter of their music, and pirating sites dont either.
p4500
aVIf you're not worried about space, there are FLAC versions of all their songs from a quick Google search.
p4501
aVSonata Arctica - San Sebastian introduced me to the genre when I heard it in (of all places) an AMV on youtube back when youtube first came out (like 2005). I actually can't stand AMVs though, but I don't think I'd ever seen one before that one.\u000a\u000aBelieve it or not, I heard Through the Fire and the Flames in 2006 BEFORE it was on Guitar Hero. HIPSTER PRIDE, jks
p4502
aVSame here,  San Sebastian had me the moment I heard it... Probably on YouTube as well. 
p4503
aVThe first Power Metal song I ever heard was Hammerfall's Heeding the Call. I found it... Wait for it... Through a Kingdom Hearts fanfic.\u000a\u000aYes, really.\u000a\u000aIt was the only Power Metal song I actually listened to for like a year before my brain rubbed two neurons together and thought, "Hey, this is awesome, why don't we check what the rest of this band's music is like?" That eventually led me to discovering the genre as a whole.
p4504
aVHammerfall-Threshold
p4505
aVAltaria - Unchain The Rain.\u000a\u000aI had heard a few occasional power metal tracks from the likes of Helloween and Edguy here and there, but never really pursued the genre, mostly because I didn't know it _was_ a genre. I somehow happened upon Altaria's Unchain The Rain and was hooked ever since.\u000a\u000aI also can't stand anything else by Altaria and only listen to Unchain the Rain occasionally for nostalgia now. Not at all a fan of theirs despite getting me into the genre.
p4506
aVIt was actually Hammerfall's Blood Bound which got me into power metal. I'd been watching a free DVD that came with a metal magazine with my stepdad and having a chuckle at some of the rubbish on there, when the video for Blood Bound came on. We both stopped and went 'Well, that was surprisingly good'. From there, i looked more and more into Hammerfall and gradually further and further into the power metal genre as a whole. 
p4507
aVRhapsody of Fire- Dawn of Victory.\u000a\u000aKind of cringey how I came across it though. I was in middle school and was looking up Legend of Zelda videos, and I found a tribute video that had it playing. Needless to say, I was hooked!
p4508
aVThe first ever power metal song that I listened to was The Eternal Flames of Metal, by Cryonic Temple, and I was blown away by its epicness.\u000a\u000aI didn't listen to any power metal for a while after that, until I discovered Galneryus, and was amazed by songs such as Future Never Dies and Angel of Salvation. At that time I hadn't heard a single song with Yama-B.\u000a\u000aAfter that it was Dragonforce, and then I found all the other great bands.
p4509
aVSonata Arctica "The Cage". Still get goosebumps every time I hear that song.
p4510
aVSo, the first power metal song I'd ever heard was [Falconer - Vid Rosornas Grav](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po3XdK1DuJY)\u000a\u000aThe story behind this is as follows:   \u000aSo, since I was like 8, I was really into Rammstein (they were the second metal (actually, I guess they're not metal) band that I'd really listened to a bunch, after Black Sabbath). Now, for some reason, I was intrigued to find some Swedish language metal (probably because I liked the novelty of Rammstein's German and was looking for more like that. (it's a wonder I didn't find [Raubtier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogLwHEPyXBE) first)\u000a\u000aAnyway, so after searching for "swedish language metal" one of the first videos I found was the Falconer song. It was alright, so I checked out the band. Once I heard [Mindtraveller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yMsxQWuWvE), I knew I had found something pretty sweet. From there I found HammerFall, Alestorm and more recently bands like Kiuas and Wisdom.
p4511
aVAlthough I had heard various other power metal songs prior to this, it wasn't until I listened to Symphony X's [King of Terrors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRc8iUc1vG8) that I really got into power metal. I liked it enough to check out a Symphony X station on Pandora Radio and it just happened to play [Angels Cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27kjPL5vdS0) by Angra. I was hooked.\u000a\u000aToday King of Terrors doesn't hold a lot of significance for me, just a song I enjoy. Angels Cry on the other hand always gets me really happy and pumped up. I'll get in the mood for it and just can't shut up about it. My friends can attest to that fact.
p4512
aVI've listened to a lot of classic rock, hard rock, and metal.  Around 2006 or 2007 (not sure exactly when, but it was prior to [this concert](http://www.last.fm/event/741564+DragonForce+at+Starland+Ballroom+on+26+November+2008)), I came across a reddit link which was a video of someone playing a Dragonforce song on Guitar Hero.  I made a Dragonforce station on Pandora and found a lot of music I liked.  Entering Eternity was the first Falconer song I heard.  A friend introduced me to Blind Guardian and Rebellion, and I introduced him to Falconer.
p4513
aVThis video which had Body Breakdown by Dragonforce\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxosvRTCOsk
p4514
aVBelieve it or not, last.fm recommended [Van Canto's Kings of Metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiESgYr35gA) to me. I was really amused and thought it was awesomely hilarious. I proceeded to get their albums, unaware of power metal.\u000a\u000aTheir covers are good, and their music helped lighten the mood. However, a chain of events was starting to happen. One cover, [Wishmaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCGQiGEYl4Y) stuck out. \u000a\u000aIn 2012, Nightwish released Imaginaerum. "Wait. Didn't Van Canto cover those guys? I'll give it a shot". I heard [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WfB8j4YuHw). Taikatalvi started out, and I was like "this is neat". \u000a\u000aThe piano or synth starts out on Storytime, and I was like "oooh". Then I heard the guitars roar in. "OOH." Then the drums, but what got me was the orchestra. "Holy shit!" and then Anette started to sing. "It's a woman, and she sounds awesome!" My jaw was dropped. "WHERE HAS THIS MUSIC BEEN ALL OF MY LIFE?!"\u000a\u000aI immediately started to find the past Nightwish albums and discovered the Tarja era. I like both singers, by the way
p4515
aVA friend introduced me to power metal by showing me a few songs from time to time. The one that really got me hooked was [Falconer - The Clarion Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iswq0SWBRFA).  \u000a\u000aIt's still one of my favourite power metal songs if not my favourite.
p4516
asVMy 2014 Albums of the Year
p4517
(lp4518
VI pretty much agree with this entire list. Falconer and Freedom Call are probably my #2 and #3/4 of the year.\u000a\u000aNoble Beast's self-titled ended up being #1 for me.
p4519
aVNoble Beast really surprised me! Glad I bought their album.
p4520
aVLooks like I really gotta check them out
p4521
aV&gt; Alestorm showing they're far from running dry\u000a\u000aWell... when the time comes to write album [five], you know they'll scrape the barrel once more.
p4522
aVI was actually listening to scraping the barrel on the way to work this morning and chuckled, because they did exactly what they said they would. (And it was pretty good in the end!)
p4523
aVFor me, an Alestorm album should be just what it was: goofy pirate-and-alcohol-themed lyrics with kickass music behind them.\u000a\u000aThat said, they should be able to scrape that barrel over and over again (and I hope they do for a long time).
p4524
aVThanks for putting Heroes up there.\u000a\u000aSome people dismiss it, but I think it's brilliant, one of Sabaton's best (better than Carolus Rex, imo).
p4525
aVI got a lot of love for CR and I like that they went in a different direction with that  so Hereos doesn't quite budge that for me. Feels like a small step back by comparison. But the songs are catchy and glorious all the same.
p4526
aVYeah, I see why people like CR so much, but for some reason CR doesn't resonate with me like Heroes does.\u000a\u000aTo each his own, we all have different tastes.
p4527
aVIMO, Carolus Rex is held back a bit by being a concept album, they didn't have the freedom they had on Heroes. Both are great albums though. 
p4528
aVThanks for that. I'm a long time fan of bands like Gamma Ray, Edguy, Hammerfall and more on your list. You have just given me plenty of recommendations to enjoy over Christmas!
p4529
aVHappy Metal Christmas!
p4530
aVIf I made one of these my choices would look so hipsterish...
p4531
aVDon't worry, it's the same with my list. I'll post it closer to the end of the year, but it's incredibly *out there*.
p4532
aVIt's more that I can only listen to a subset of stuff since I don't listen to music all day every day, so I focus on stuff that people may not be as familiar with to try and find something new that I like. In my case I specifically looked at basically every PM band originating from Canada over the past year/year and a half (I'm Canadian, so might as well). Maybe I'll do the same with another country soon.\u000a\u000aOr to put it in a simpler manner, I kind of know what bands I do and don't like of the big bands. Might as well see what new stuff is being done.
p4533
aVConsidered leaving out the heavy hitters and mention some lesser knowns but that doesn't encapsulate 2014 in power metal as fully. Then it wouldn't provide much of a service or talking-point to the sub at large I guess.\u000a\u000aWhat were your highlights? You should do a list
p4534
aVEh maybe I'll do one at some point but I'd preface it with something like "I have a pretty narrow view here so if your favorite band isn't on here it doesn't mean I don't like them, it just means I didn't listen to them a lot this year"\u000a\u000aThat's not to say what I talk about would suck...just that I might recommend stuff that everyone didn't listen to.
p4535
aVGood list man, some albums on your list that I didn't even know were out, gonna have to check them out. 
p4536
aVThanks! Left out plenty too, it's been a good year!
p4537
aVThe pagan manifesto was a pleasant surprise for me. Thoroughly enjoyed that album. 
p4538
aVAh, that time of the year again. Freedom Call marginally missed being my # 1 this year, I'll post my list in 20 days in case something changes (like a new album being released that blows me away, even though I doubt it). 
p4539
aVI wish crystal eyes kept the vocalist they had on Chained. I really liked the sound of that album. 
p4540
aVI think Stormborn and Rise Of The Hero should be put into the "good" personally.
p4541
aVHard to argue with that list. I may have one or two switch from the Amazing and Good spots (Primal Fear and Edguy come to mind), but otherwise it looks good to me.
p4542
aVSomeone else liked  Pariah's Child?
p4543
aVThere was nothing particularly wrong with the album (cept the mastering apparently).\u000a\u000aWasn't perfect. Was pretty darn good and went in a good direction compared to their previous stuff. Blood was the best song they've recorded in years.
p4544
aVI totally agree with your list, except one small thing\u000a\u000aI really liked Machinae Supremacy's album this year, yes, its not perfect, and in my opinion, Overworld is by far my favorite of theirs, but i wouldn't go as far as to call it one of the worst...\u000a\u000aI would put it in "The Not Bad"....its not amazing, but its a great listen in my opinion
p4545
aVThat's a fair call i only gave it a couple of listens 
p4546
aVglad to see elvenking and derdian get some recognition.  I didnt know either of these bands were popular.  (or in the case of elvenking popular anymore).  I didnt know some of these bands had albums coming out this year, will have to check them out, thanks for this great list.\u000a\u000aSo far for my dragonforce has been keeping me on repeat the most with three hammers and symphony of the night.
p4547
aV2014 offered up so much tasty metal. Cheers and enjoy!
p4548
aVThere's a distinct lack of Noble Beast and Disforia in this list.
p4549
aVDisforia's The Age of Ether was probably my favorite album. Getting Hansi Kursch to do guest vocals was also brilliant on their part.
p4550
aVHum, the year is not even over. Won't there be any more 2014 releases??
p4551
aVThere's really not much. Nothing I'm excited about anyway.
p4552
aVYour amazing is my good/not bad!
p4553
asVWhat's your favourite power metal album cover art of this year?
p4554
(lp4555
VThere's no question...\u000a\u000a[Falconer - Black Moon Rising](http://i.imgur.com/DJKvHlE.jpg)
p4556
aVI just never liked their logo; this cover just accentuate how 'plain' it looks. As for the cover, despite being a tad monochromatic, is anything but plain :D
p4557
aVXandria http://planetmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/xandria-phoenix-album-cover-1.jpg
p4558
aVIt's my favourite one as well! As kickass as the title song! :D
p4559
aVFor now, i think that my favourite is [Neonfly - Strangers in Paradise](http://www.maximumvolumemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_0797-1.jpg)
p4560
aVWow. Impressive. Here for [hi-res detailed version](http://www.maximumvolumemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_0797-1.jpg)
p4561
aVThanks! I've changed it now.
p4562
aV[Sabaton's Heroes](http://www.sabaton.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/heroes2version1.jpg) is pretty kickass. ([Both versions](http://trueblackdiamond.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/sabaton-heroes.jpg))\u000a\u000aAnd of course... [A mighty, beautiful wolf.](http://k45.kn3.net/4/C/1/8/6/F/7D9.jpg)
p4563
aVNot sure if it belongs here, but Katatonia's [Kocytean](http://katatonia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/kocytean.png) has some really stunning art.\u000a\u000aBut I must agree, Sabaton and Sonata Arctica are almost cheating when it comes to cover art. Both have always had absolutely amazing art. Always my favorites.
p4564
aVIs that a giant drowning bird?
p4565
aVYes. Depressing, like all their music, but very good.\u000a\u000aActually, I'd advise listening to anything Jonas Renkse has touched.
p4566
aVI'll keep that in mind!\u000a\u000aAlmost same birthdate as Kakko. 
p4567
aVLol, I've got a friend born on May 16th (yes, I've made fun of her for it). Megan Fox also has Tony Kakko's birthday. It's weird.
p4568
aVTaurus ladies. &lt;3

aV[radicated]
p4570
aVThey do pick the worst of the worst sometimes. My cousin eventually straightened up. We're all relieved now.
p4571
aVDidn't know Katatonia released a new album this year\u000a\u000aedit: oh, just a compilation
p4572
aVI just recently got into Katatonia, so it's all new to me thankfully.\u000a\u000aI can't wait for more.
p4573
aVAnd a beautiful raven.
p4574
aVNot only this year, but *ever*:\u000a\u000a[Melodius Deite - Episode II: Voyage Through The Land of Fantasy](http://www.inazumaprod.com/userdata/gfx/36cf54bbe8ef8adcc1f128f365a77845.jpg).
p4575
aVThat looks like a city in Civ with all the wonders built.
p4576
aVwell, track 5 is called Civilization and is exactly 16 minutes long
p4577
aVI am going to have to check this out.
p4578
aVA few I thought were particularly awesome...\u000a\u000a[Crosswind - Vicious Dominion](http://metalfields.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/crosswind_vicious-dominion_cover.jpg)\u000a\u000a[Dynazty - Renatus](http://i.recordshopx.com/cover/big/3/38/385004.jpg?cd)\u000a\u000a[Arion - Last of Us](http://blackwindmetal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Arion-Last-Of-Us.jpg)
p4579
aVI thought [Maximum Overload](http://apochs.net/2/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dragonforce-MaximumOverloadLarge.jpg) by DragonForce was pretty cool. High degree of detail.
p4580
aVWow. So much quality. Now i can clearly see this Power Within logo, to the right from this guy brain.
p4581
aVAnd the second one, to the left from his brain.
p4582
aVThe art really does match the album title, as well.
p4583
aVIt's kind of odd; on the whole, the cover looks *super* busy and hectic. But, if you know don't know what to look for, the space in between the band name and the title in the center is almost empty, and you snap to it.\u000a\u000aI'm no artist, but I think that design choice does an excellent job drawing your eyes to the important parts of the cover before you go visually exploring the rest.
p4584
aVI thought this album cover was one of the least interesting this year. It's kinda intricate I suppose but as far as pm artwork goes it's not all too inspiring. Come to think of it DF haven't had decent album art since Sonic Firestorm...and even then...
p4585
aVEdguy - Space Police, aka the album i hated then loved.
p4586
aVI don't think I've loved a single Edguy release post Hellfire Club.
p4587
aVI'm on mobile right now so I can't link to it, but for the love of Hansi, someone post the cover to *Fantasia* by Estate.

asVFor all you metal Karaoke junkies out there, we released a karaoke version of our song "Chains on Fire". And to stay true to the soul of Karaoke, we did it on VHS.
p4625

aVBetween DAM, JoySound and the machines at Karaoke no Tetsujin, there is a huge library of PM Karaoke, even 2 Lost Horizon songs
p4628
aVyep, i recall going to karaoke no tetsujin and they were very nice
p4629
aVI'll probably post some when I got home, but after I came back I signed up for a JoySound account and can grab some of the videos over VPN. I've posted a couple on my youtube channel, but I need to add more money into my digital wallet since they don't use PayPal or anything easy and my account ran out last month.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpOk1T-j3IjflykxIwmitUQ

aVI'm jealous. I'm in Silicon Valley and there's not much power metal here
p4633
aVi'm in canada now, there's less than like anywhere else in the world
p4634
aVYou made me curious though. The place's karaoke list is online, and man what a pain-in-the-ass is it to search. I can't just go "find me POWAAA METTTUUULL" or even "rock". \u000a\u000aIf the place has the [Karaoke Champ](http://www.karaokechamp.com/song_search.html) system, I found the following songs:\u000a\u000a42. Helloween: Nabatea and Are you metal\u000a42. Sonata Arctica: Wolves Die Young and Losing my Insanity\u000a42. Within Temptation: Faster and Shot in the Dark\u000a42. Unisonic: Unisonic (One of my least favorite song of theirs, but some people like it)\u000a\u000aOne tip is to check out the Japanese selection. Some songs are on there but not on the English ones. I wish I could have found Avantasia or a bunch of other bands; or even more of bands like Sonata Arctica

(lp4640
VI'm still kicking myself for finding this album for $9 and NOT picking it up.
p4641
aVThis album is a strange one for me. Joacim is easily one of my favourite singers ever, but somehow the songs on this album don't really fit his voice. It's too bad because the other HammerFall side project from around this time (Full Strike) sounds just like HammerFall.\u000a\u000aIn any case, I still enjoy this album a lot.
p4642
aVJust a question, slightly related, what's your opinion of the [Warlord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1L8sTSI4iE) album with Joacim on vocals?
p4643
aVI've actually never managed to get my hands on a copy of that album so I haven't heard it, but I'll definitely try and youtube a track or two when I get home from work tonight. Is it any good?
p4644
aVI haven't listened to it extensively, but I definitely like it more than his first solo album; definitely worth a listen or two
p4645
asVImperial Age - Anthem Of Valour. I'm in love with this violin
p4646
(lp4647
VGonna be honest, I was a little confused about the violin shoutout, but then I got to the solo....\u000a\u000aI'm glad solo violin is growing in metal. Only other major example I can think of is the guest violin in Keldian - Sundancer, and of course the violin in the majority of Ne Obliviscaris' stuff.\u000a\u000aBut yeah, we need more.
p4648
aVI don't care what anyone says, that was a fantastic album. Also Battle Heart fucking rocks.
p4649
asVRocka Rollas - The War of Steel Has Begun
p4650
(lp4651
VI agree completely on the Freedom Call / Crystal Eyes reference. That end note was chilling, loved it! \u000a
p4652
aVReally just speed metal, but close enough that it doesn't matter.  This band is totally righteous.
p4653
aVOlder stuff I'd agree with you, but this new album borders on Crystal Eyes and Freedom Call territory with the choruses. Yet it is done, as you say, totally righteously.
p4654
aV"Totally righteous."  What year am I in...
p4655
asVTwilight Force - Eagle fly free (Helloween Cover)
p4656
(lp4657
VAlready a fantastic song - Glad to hear another take on it with vocals that do the original justice. 
p4658
aVNo one does justice to Michael Kiske. He comes close though
p4659
aVSo true
p4660
aVWow! Fantastic cover! This beats Vision Divine's cover of this by far!
p4661
aVIts nice to see these guys covering a band other than Rhapsody for once.
p4662
aVThat is such an odd comment to make.  Isn't it normal for a band to take inspiration from another band or bands?  They are not the first Rhapsody clone.  Other bands constantly clone other bands... it is just how things work.
p4663
aVTwilight force is the only one getting its dick sucked every time you turn around.  Porn level deep throat action. 
p4664
aVWell... them and Gloryhammer.
p4665
aVGloryhammer sucks dick.
p4666
aV[deleted]
p4667
aVYeah yeah, i've been hearing it for two years. These "goofy" bands that don't take themselves seriously which somehow puts them above any sort of criticism.  Whether they are being serious or not, they still write shitty music.  
p4668
aVWhat is the Wizard saying at the end? While the outro is happening. All you can really hear is him speaking, and then "...came the Twilight Force.. and thus, the ancient prophecies - were fulfilled."\u000a\u000aIt starts right at the 5 minute mark.
p4669
aV"And as the eagle spread its wings, it turned into a glorious dragon. And with its magic, came the Twilight Force. And thus, the ancient prophecies were fulfilled."

aVI honestly wish I could give you gold. It may not seem like a gold-worthy comment, but you just made me a really happy fella. &lt;3

asV[Savatagurday] Savatage - Castles Burning
p4675
(lp4676
VTheir most underrated album IMO.
p4677
asVCain's Offering - Morhpeus In A Masquerade. Listen to this song and see how every part of this song is different from each other, how Timo's singing every verse in a totally different way from the last one
p4678
(lp4679
VThis is one of my favorite songs to sing along with until I run out of breath.
p4680
aVI love Cain's Offering and I can barely wait for their new album. That being said, I don't think Timo is as theatrical with his voice as you put it. If anything, a bit too "stiff" at times
p4681
aVFor some reason i can't stand his voice. It makes me not able to take any of cain's offering's lyrics seriously, and they are already pretty lame...
p4682
aVYou think the lyrics are lame? Really? I see them as very well written, actually. I think Jani is a fantastic composer and his lyrics, dark, poetic and the right amount of teenage-angsty, fit very well in his sound.\u000a\u000aAs for Kotipelto, he's one of those singers we call an "acquired taste"
p4683
aVI see them as a bit too angsty, but as I said, with Timo's voice it is simply amplified beyond the point where i can take heartfelt lyrics seriously. \u000a\u000aOr rather, it may be the fact that it doesn't sound like proper english, sort of like when the japanese butcher english it's impossible to take a song even with good instrumentation seriously. Obviously it's not as bad, but lines like "I need it to make this thing right" sound too colloquial to be taken seriously alongside "I am unworthy to be sacrificed, I'm such a tragic comic". It's a bit awkward. As I said, I can appreciate the instrumental work (to an extent), but their first album has vocals that I find hard to take a liking to. Also, he pronounces things incorrectly "please caerss me"
p4684
aVLol, he does have a noticeable Finnish accent and emphasizes the wrong syllables sometimes. And his timbre is very odd at his highest notes. And I don't like that vocal fry thing he does when he wants to sound emotional (he does that quite a lot in his acoustic album with Jani). Speaking of Japanese people butchering the English language, Toshi from X Japan strikes me as another acquired taste.\u000a\u000aMaybe I just find these accents to be charming.
p4685
aVJani is a easier vocalist to listen to than Timo, in my opinion.
p4686
aVDamn, both you and the yt uploader put an error on the word "Morhpeus", I'm sure you know it's Morpheus, just a little correction.
p4687
aVI know it's Morpheus. I didn't noticed untill you mentioned it. Title was based on yt name so you know, shit happens
p4688
aVI have never heard of them, but this was amazing. I will try some more of their stuff.
p4689
aVThis is how Sonata Arctica should sound like.
p4690
aVJANI LIIMATAINEN, a former member of Sonata Arctica and a member of Cain's Offering. He's an incredible song writer and guitar player. That's why Sonata was awesome and Cain's Offering is awesome.
p4691
aVGet the fuck out of here.
p4692
aV[This speaks for itslelf...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBACRtmu0VQ)\u000a\u000a\u000aNo offence, though. I just preffer the old Sonata/Cain's Offering. I mean, just compare [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBACRtmu0VQ) with [White Pearl, Black Oceans...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQtuPvtye5Y) 
p4693
aVA balled compared to an epic? :/ If you're trying to make a point you're failing at it.\u000a\u000a*I mean, just compare Tallulah to Wrecking the Sphere*.\u000a\u000aPariah's Child was a pretty solid album. Hell, I'm even using Blood as the basis of my senior project.

(lp4704
VExcellent way to do a list. I appreciate it being different and simple to get into.\u000a\u000aFeedback wise;\u000a\u000aI'm sad to see you put Gamma Ray as a disappointment. Although the album was not an instant classic like most of their albums are, it was a huge step up from the "shot and tired" sounding vocals from To The Metal.\u000a\u000aEven Edguy wasn't terrible. Not a must have (something I don't think they've had since Rocket Ride) but not an embarassing effort. It is a step in a more Power Metal direction, rather than a "We're a Hard Rock band now" direction.\u000a\u000aBut Freedom Call was THAT good this year? I just got back into the swing of listening to them and was unsure if newer material was any good. (I fell off at about Dimensions and have everything before, minus their first album) but I will have to search it out when I can.
p4705
aVGamma Ray: It isn't just the vocals, everything about them has been off since Majesty for whatever reason. Empire of the Undead is the best of the three albums since, and it isn't a bad album... I just know that Kai Hansen &amp; Co. are capable of putting out material that is so much better. Unfortunately they just haven't shown it for nine years now... that's what it's the biggest disappointment. \u000a\u000aEdguy: I actually generally like newer Edguy, and like Gamma Ray this wasn't an awful album. Just a lackluster one, and I get the feeling it was rushed out. With a bit more effort, it would've been a strong album.\u000a\u000aFreedom Call: Yes! It was actually rather surprising how good this album was given that I've found their recent albums not worth listening to.
p4706
aVFair enough on Gamma Ray, although I would argue that Land of the Free II was an excellent album.\u000a\u000aEdguy I felt that too. Some stuff was good, but it could have been better. It's how I felt for Age of the Joker; good but should be better.
p4707
aVWoo, Falconer at best album *and* best album art. I couldn't agree more. :D\u000a\u000aSort of surprised that Mathias Blad didn't get honorable mentions for **Best Male Vocalist**\u000a\u000aEither way, great list. Good job :D
p4708
aVHaha, thanks for catching my error! As I noted before I delved in, Falconer and Blind Guardian weren't eligible for categories 3, 4, and 5. For best male vocalist, it otherwise would have been Hansi, then Mathias.
p4709
aVAh, didn't catch that bit at the top the first time around, sorry about that. \u000a\u000aHansi then Mathias, good to hear it :D

p4714
aVInteresting list, I rather liked the presentation of it too. Top X lists can be great but also over abundant so it's great seeing someone break the mould. I especially like your inclusion of non-music related entries. I know Brandon Sanderson only by his reputation for completing the *Wheel of Time* series, I haven't yet had the chance to read anything by him. This is pushing me to want to dive into the *Stormlight Archive* over my holiday break.\u000a\u000aAlso, I'm going to have to re-listen to Persuader. I keep hearing good things about it but when I listened to a few tracks I wasn't captivated. Could be I was just overly distracted at the time.
p4715
aV[deleted]
p4716
aVOk, so i'm currently reading The Way of Kings and i'm having trouble committing to it.  Mainly because the books start out with one of the coolest fantasy characters I have ever come across(Szeth) and then instantly abandons him and we get stuck with boring ass Dalinar.  \u000a\u000aI gather from your post that this is a series I should stick with though.\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso, solid music selections.  Especially picking Ida.  I think i'm in love  with her.  
p4717
aVYou will see more of him, so at least there's that to look forward to.\u000a\u000aMy big issue with *The Way of Kings* is its slow pacing. I normally don't have an issue with slow books, but I just didn't find it terribly interesting in WoK. I think the series will prove itself, though, as it's already beginning to with WoR.
p4718
aVYeah, its extremely slow right now. I understand its needed to get us in the world hes trying to build, but he could spice it up a bit.  
p4719
aVI like that you included a book and video game entries. And I agree 100% with your choices there. *Word of Radiance* was amazing and is my book of the year, but it's the only 2014 book I've read so that's not really fair I guess, haha. I think I would stick with it anyway if I had read other 2014 releases. \u000a\u000aDragon Age: Inquisition, while I haven't yet finished it, I think it's going to be my GOTY 2014, it's just so freaking good. At least definitely the best fantasy game I've played this year. 
p4720
aVNothing in Power Metal this year really stood out for me (probably because I took a break from the genre this year to find other stuff) but my favorite vocalist of the year are Ryan Boc (Sequester), Ardraos (Suhnopfer), and Wulf (Neurotech). My favorite Power Metal album is Pariah's Child (given that it's the only one I really payed attention to unless Skyforest's debut album counts). Sakharov - Under My April Moon, My Material Season - Awakening to the Piano Dramatic and Katse - Perusta are also some good ones. My album of the year is Suhnopfer - Offertoire, and my other favorite non-Power Metal albums are Sequester - Missing Image, Mechina - Xenon, Neurotech - Infra Versus Ultra, and Mare Cognitum - Phobos Monolith. 
p4721
aVThere were some great power metal albums this year, you might want to explore some of the bands I listed as well as go through these lists:\u000a\u000a[mushmancat's top albums](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2pmxx3/mushmancats_year_in_review_2014/)\u000a\u000a[UnlostHorizon's top albums](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2pr21q/unlosthorizons_year_in_review_2014/)\u000a\u000a[Snake_Byte's top albums](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2ovitq/my_2014_albums_of_the_year/)
p4722
aVI mean I"m sure there were a bunch of very good albums, just nothing that brought anything really groundbreaking/new or experimental for Power Metal from what I've read of reviews of this year's albums, which is the reason I took a break from the genre this year.

aVDunno why, but something is fucked up with spotify. Blind Guardian "Twilight of the Gods" is not available too. I was listening to it yesterday. Today morning i wanted to listen to it and it wasn't available in my country. Battle Beasts albums are not avaible as well. Something is wrong.\u000a

aVHaving some problems with a few bands, been trying to look into it, no idea what's going on with it
p4766
aVI don't know why. But I can completely understand why any artist would remove their content from Spotify. A friend of mine just got his royalty payment from Spotify and it's fair to say that the £0.07 he made isn't going to go very far.

p4782
aVToday's patch gave me a few problems, so I'll wait until tomorrow to start it. The game starts with Charlotte Wessels, and I think there's some Alissa White-Gluz, but I don't know about Tony. \u000a\u000aI was going to buy the soundtrack, but since it's only available in April with Act 2, I decided to buy the game as well to get a taste of it. They should have delayed the launch, it's pretty broken. 
p4783
aVGod, such a damn shame. Such an absurd amount of potential ;_;
p4784
aVI'm really pissed off, honestly. Look at this: \u000a\u000a"We realise we haven't had the best start. A lot of new things came to light after releasing the game on STEAM. However, we're very thankful for the patience a lot of people have been showing, it keeps us motivated! *We are doing our utmost best to make Karmaflow a solid experience by the time Act II* (making the game complete) *is launched*, and will continue patching Act I on a regular basis!"
p4785
aVYeah, it sucks that so many studios are releasing what's essentially beta tests as finished games and counting on the blind optimism of early adopters.
p4786
aVIt's also the fact that they're "almost surprised" that the game is fubar. 
p4787
aVI'm not taking the plunge just yet. I certainly like the idea of it though.
p4788
aVLooks like a shoddy game, but with cool art style and sweet music. Charlotte is in it. &lt;3

aVI bought it at the Century Media table at New England Metalfest back in the day. I checked MA, I guess I just have the NEMS enterprises Digipack.  
p4808

aVYou should be binging on Ravenhead!  Granted, It doesn't come close to To The End, but its solid so far.

aVThis is pretty damn good.  I actually smiled at the keyboard/horn section at 3:20 just because it was entirely unexpected.  Phyralis just said he wants to know how my mind works(Jokingly I assume, but here is the answer).  I want stuff to be unexpected, for songs to take me by surprise. Listening to the genre for so long, stuff just becomes predictable and cliche, so stuff like this is what I look for. \u000a\u000aI dont know if this is visigoth good though.

aV&gt; The great classics are rarely over 40 minutes.\u000a\u000aThat's because the classics were released during an age where cassettes and vinyls were the norm for music, and those had smaller capacities than a modern CD. 12" LP's can't fit anymore than 22 minutes on a single side.

aVBut the majority of their better albums does not John as singer.\u000a\u000aAnd I love John but his voice has lost some of it's magic over the last couple of years.\u000a\u000aSo I would hope that Zach sings in Wacken, although what do I care. I don't have a ticket anyways :(
p4903
aVJon sang on seven albums, Zak sang on five. Jon -almost- sang on Handful of Rain, considering he wrote and played the entire damn thing. I prefer Zak over Jon, but there is no arguing that Jon is usually the preferred vocalist.
p4904
aVTheir best albums are Hall of the mountain King through Edge of Thorns. 
p4905
aVI am pretty sure I read somewhere that Zak would be there.\u000a\u000aFor me, it's important he be there. For the past few years, Jon Oliva and Zak have been doing Savatage tributes with their own bands. For it to be a Savatage reunion in name, it should have the majority of the band's important players. \u000a\u000aEdge of Thorns should definitely be included in the classic Savatage releases along with Hall of the Mountain King, Gutter Ballet, and Streets. I also enjoy the next three Savatage albums with Zak just as much as well.\u000a\u000aAlso, I will be at this show, so I'm really hoping Zak is there and they have a good mix of songs from both eras!
p4906
aVI hate you for being at the show,;)\u000a\u000aBut I so agree with you that he was the voice on the majority of the band's important albums.\u000a\u000aI so hope that they will throw in some shows in NA preferably Canada so that I can see them one more time.\u000a
p4907
aVYou are the only person alive who doesn't consider hall of the mountain king and gutter ballet their important albums. \u000a\u000aFeel free to like the later era more, but don't call it the important era.

aV[deleted]
p4922
aVThis is a really awesome guide! I agree that Iron Savior is a band everyone knows, but nobody talks about. To be fair, I think a large part of that is distribution. Their distribution in North America is very poor. For that reason, the only album of theirs I have is Condition Red, but I love it. Surprisingly, everything else I've heard from the band hasn't really caught my attention, but that album is a masterpiece for me. I am still trying to seek out their other records because I'd probably like them if I put some time into listening to them.
p4923
aVGlad you like it, I absolutely agree. Their albums aren't even always on Amazon.

The city was attacked by the [Visigoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths), led by [Alaric I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_I). At that time, Rome was no longer the capital of the [Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire), having been replaced in this position by [Ravenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenna) in 402. Nevertheless, the city of Rome retained a paramount position as "the eternal city" and a spiritual center of the Empire. The sack was a major shock to contemporaries, friends and foes of the Empire alike.\u000a\u000a&gt;This was the first time in almost 800 years that Rome had fallen to a foreign enemy. The previous [sack of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Allia) had been accomplished by the [Gauls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul) under their leader [Brennus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brennus_(4th_century\u005c)) in 387 BC. The sacking of 410 is seen as a major landmark in the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire). [St. Jerome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jerome), living in Bethlehem at the time, wrote that "The City which had taken the whole world was itself taken." \u000a\u000a&gt;====\u000a\u000a&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/Aiv4CQQ.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Roman_empire_395.jpg)\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a^Interesting: [^Pope ^Innocent ^I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_I) ^| [^Alaric ^I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_I) \u000a\u000a^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+co9a869) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+co9a869)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

p4952
aVI find, for me, the magic is gone from Kamelot after Roy left. I like Silverthorn, but it doesn't have the appeal of Roy's albums. I still wish them well, and think Tommy is a great singer.\u000a\u000a*EDIT: I should add that I am excited to hear this new album.
p4953
aVWhat were your thoughts on GO/PftP? I think the "magic" was waning already. I enjoy everything GO and on, but the only really "magical" Kamelot albums, in my opinion, are Epica+TBH. Again, I hold the other albums dear to my heart, but when I sit back and think about it, Epica+TBH are the true masterpieces which outshine and inflate the perceived value of Kam's discography.\u000a\u000aI'm falling asleep so I have no idea what I'm rambling about. I love Kamelot then and now, that's all I know haha.
p4954
aVYeah, I think Black Halo was Roy's last best album. Every damn song on that album is fantastic. GO/PftP are really great though. 
p4955
aVI think I'd include Karma on that list of magical albums as well. 
p4956
aV*Karma* had the beginnings of the band's magic, and nearly every song is perfection, but in its entirety it doesn't match the next 2 for me. Very close though!

aVI'm thinking about getting the deluxe version with the instrumentals. Did anyone do that for Silverthorn? How were those just as instrumentals? Maybe I could at least jam some guitar over it.  
p4960
aVThe instrumentals on Silverthorn were disappointing because they didn't cut all the vocals out of them. They cut out Tommy's, yes, but all of the background vocals were left in, and it was really distracting. Hopefully they fix that this time.

aVI still don't like Infected at all, but rEvolution turned out to be powerful again, so can't wait to see them live in the summer!
p4977
aVSo, this mini-rant isn't completely directed at you, but I thought I'd bring it up here, since maybe you can answer it. :D\u000a\u000aI'm interested in why people don't like Infected... I mean, it *has* to be the gimmick, right? Like, the instrumentation is the best on Infected of all the HammerFall albums, but they have this theme of life and death which is all anchored by the zombie motif. And I guess people don't like that they're not singing about Templars, and that Hector isn't on the cover? I have to think that people don't like Infected because it's different (not musically, not even really lyrically, but just with the look).\u000a\u000aI didn't start listening to HammerFall until sometime after Infected came out, so I've never known a HammerFall without Infected. As such, I think I have a little bit less biased of opinion on it. I can understand why someone would dislike the change in direction, but I think that now that it's in the past, people should take another look and realize that it's an awesome album with a silly gimmick.
p4978
aVHammerFall is a band that people don't like in general after their first couple of records. I think they're a band that people take a little too seriously, and end up missing a lot of the fun they offer. I understand that they've been on a gradual decline up to and including Infected, but I still enjoy all of it.\u000a\u000aThe reason Infected garners so much hate is twofold. Firstly, the new imagery and themes led to a ton of people who only liked the first two HammerFall records to check them out again, and then they found out that the band really is getting worse. The other reason is because the imagery is a bit of a slap in the face to the longtime fans. There are a lot of really great songs on this album, and many HammerFall classics IMO, but there's also a ton of stuff that just doesn't work at all.  
p4979
aVFirst of all, i'm not a die-hard HF fan, i've been listening to them during the years on and off, never saw them live (it's gonna change this summer tho) and i'm by no means used to writing music reviews (even less so in English language), so keep that in mind. But on the other hand, this is the band that got me in listening to metal in the first place.\u000a\u000aFor me, the first new album which came out after I discovered them was No Sacrifice, No Victory and I thought it was a bit weaker, you know, if you look back at last one, Threshold, it is pretty much just a fast-paced power storm thrusted in your face. NSNV got in my eyes (or ears) more complicated, more tempo changes and surely me personally being overhyped about the whole thing did play a role. Later I got used to the new sound more and the moment I realised I do not have anything against NSNV anymore was when Infected came out. \u000a\u000aInfected just doesn't *work* for me. I have a pretty dull programming job, after each day of it I just need to get in the car, turn the key and have a couple of flaming hammers wielding dragons fly me in a finger four formation home. The more over-the-top, the better. You know, to start up my brain again, give me some energy. This is all I need from power metal. \u000a\u000aI think the reason Infected doesn't make me happy is that it doesn't have any BIG song, you know that one or two which just shovels the feeling of power in your face and tell you to eat it, like Secrets, Genocide, One of a Kind, or thing like Origins from rEvolution which is in my opinion partially some kind of inner joke in the terms of how over the top POWER the lyrics are (I have to say laughed when I heard them rhyme "on" three times in a single verse), but that doesn't matter for some reason, it works for me.\u000a\u000aOn Infected closest to this comes I'd say The Outlaw, which starts great, but when you expect some glorious chorus to blow you further in your seat, the tempo just slows down and melodies get technical and this is I think pretty much the definition of the whole album.\u000a\u000aMost of the songs would perfectly fit in a HF album, but there needs to be *something more* accompanying them is what was wrong with Infected I'd say.

We're only deeming that argument invalid because this "cheesiness" is intended and quite enjoyable if you can appreciate that. By making fun of what those people are saying, you're technically making fun of yourself, because it is your own argument to begin with, we merely turned it around.\u000a\u000a

p4991
aV**Argument A**:  \u000a- Gloryhammer is bad because they're generic/silly/etc. (Umbrella term for criticisms: cheesy)  \u000a- Reasoning: Cheesiness is a determinant of musical quality\u000a\u000a**Argument B**:  \u000a- Gloryhammer is good because they're cheesy  \u000a- Reasoning: cheesiness is a determinant of musical quality\u000a\u000aBoth arguments use the exact same reasoning. First saying A then making fun of B is essentially to make fun of your own reasoning.\u000a\u000aBoth arguments are equally flawed. 
p4992
aVI haven't made the argument that cheesiness is a detriment to musical quality. 
p4993
aVSo why this discussion? Other people have said they have more merit than their cheesiness. The vocals are pretty good, the melodies are catchy, the production is pretty good, lighten the fuck up and try to enjoy it. Nobody is claiming they're the best power metal band ever.
p4994
aVWhy would I try to enjoy something I don't like? 
p4995
aVSo why try to convince people to not like it as well?
p4996
aVI'm not?
p4997
aVMy brain hurts. No one understands what you are saying except me it seems.
p4998
aVHaha, I will whole heartedly agree that such reasoning is terrible. I have never understood it as reasoning nor have I ever used it myself.  \u000a\u000aI think this album only has 1 great song, and 1 good song, and for much more logical reasons. \u000a\u000aThe great being The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee. This is a solid power metal song and I feel it is hard to disagree. It may be generic, but generic does NOT equal bad. This is very well done generic. It has a nice galloping intro and verse, and the chorus contains very catchy melody lines with great keyboards and unarguably amazing vocals. The guitar solo is also the best on the album.\u000a\u000aAngus McFife follows under nearly the same thoughts. The only difference is minus the guitar solo. Once again. Catchy, generic, strong vocals, and decent instrumentation.\u000a\u000aAfter these the album falls off hard, being less catchy with less inspired instrumentation while continuing the generic path. 5/10 is a very fair score for this album.\u000a\u000aThe fact that every positive comment involves this band not taking itself seriously is cringe worthy and everyone who commented as such should feel bad.\u000a\u000aAll of this said, between their instrumental potential, their solid production, the fantastic vocals and the occasional nice melody lines, I AM interested to see what they do next.

aVI really like Amulet of Justice and I'm not sure why, maybe it's because in this fictional world there's an amulet FOR JUSTICE and it has its own destiny. It's also a really fast song which I love.
p5000
aVIn my defense, the nonseriousness is only one of my main reasons for liking Gloryhammer, I didn't feel like listing them at length. I find the lead singer's vocals to be enjoyable, he hits some great notes, like some of the powermetal greats can. I like their guitar tone, the tempo to their songs, and believe it or not, the story content. It's poorly written from an English standpoint, but I find that endearing for the most part. ("I will make Zargothrax die!")   
p5001
aVI like that they sing about undead unicorns
p5002
aVFrom what I've listened to of Gloryhammer so far, it's either:\u000a\u000a1. overly standard chorus/verse/chorus power metal with nothing interesting for me\u000a\u000a2. playing as if they wished they were rhapsody\u000a\u000aAs for the lyrics being cheesy, i don't have a real problem with that, but the lyrics being interesting are usually the only thing that redeems otherwise nothing-special songs instrumentally. In this case, I couldn't really call the lyrics interesting.\u000a\u000aAlso, for Angus McFife, I can't help but say I'd rather just listen to a more energetic version of the pre-chorus and chorus in an extremely-structurally similar song: [The Quest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KHzN0XOn6A#t=63)
p5003
aVPersonally I like Gloryhammer just because they don't take themselves seriously at all, you can definitely see the influence from Alestorm. It almost seems like a parody of Rhapsody of Fire and Hammerfall
p5004
aVDont listen to the offended power-metal neckbeards who are upset that Gloryhammer doesnt take themselves seriously. Its overly cheesy because it TRIES to be. Personally I loved this album. Its kick ass power metal with a coherent narrative spanning the entire album.
p5005
aVLet's get something straight here, criticism of a band doesn't make the people somehow wrong. It's their point of view. Let's start encouraging this viewpoint among metalheads so the conversation doesn't devolve into 'he's a neckbeard if he doesn't like Gloryhammer'. I love Gloryhammer, but I can see why some others *wouldn't* like it. They aren't somehow lesser for it.

aVOh my... another post of the year candidate so soon!
p5008
aVHero.
p5009
aVIt being purposefully satire doesn't automatically make it well done or not. Opinions on that certainly seem to be mixed, but even then most of the criticism the band receives is aimed at the overly generic music rather than the lyrics.
p5010
aVThats fair it just really bothers me when people complain about their cheese when thats the fuckin point ya know? Its like they went to see The Expendables and said "that movie sucked it was all guns and explosions". The music is not incredible no but i love the story telling and the lyricism.
p5011
aVI'm confused, does that somehow invalidate their complaints?
p5012
aVSometimes. When you say "I hate the cheese" thats fine, thats basically "they arent my thing so i dont like them". But when you say things like "these guys suck they are cheeseballs with shitty lyrics" you are saying "this bands bad because thats my opinion" which is just not how the world works.
p5013
aVThat's not really what I asked. Here's the part I'm referring to:\u000a\u000a&gt;it just really bothers me when people complain about their cheese when thats the fuckin point\u000a\u000aI'm just don't get why this bothers you. The way I'm reading this--and if I'm wrong, please elaborate--is that people should admire or appreciate the simple fact that a goal was accomplished, regardless of their opinion on the means used to achieve that goal.
p5014
aVLike I said it depends how they present their feelings. Saying they dont like it and presenting their opinion as fact are pretty distinct. And whether they can appreciate it regardless of liking it is really all about the person. Like if I see a movie I didnt like I can still appreciate it if it is well done and I think it hit the mark it was going for. The same goes with how I feel about music. I dont expect everyone to act that way but its cool when people do.
p5015
aVThe first half of your post is still *not even close* to what I was asking. Forget about presentation of opinion for a moment; it's irrelevant.\u000a\u000aThe second half seemingly answers it, but contradicts what you said previously, where you mention that it bothers you if people say they dislike something for having X quality, even though having X quality is entirely the point. So, take the following sentence:\u000a\u000a&gt;I hate Gloryhammer because they're too cheesy\u000a\u000aDoes or does that not bother you?
p5016
aVDespite being objectively better than the majority of other PM bands, Gloryhammer is hated because they are too power-metaly. It's a fantastic tribute to the genre, but because they aren't called Blind Guardian or Lost Horizon, it's going to get hate.
p5017
aVIn what aspect are they objectively better than the majority of other PM bands?
p5018
aVThey toured Australia. That's a big point in their favour to me.
p5019
aVListened through the album just to check. Everything except the guitarwork.
p5020
aVWhat about the horribly written lyrics? the non existent bass work? the overly generic aspect of everything of the songs and albums? and of course, as you mentioned, the guitar work or the absolute lack of. It's important to have in mind that PM is a guitar driven genre.
p5021
aVMeant for bass to be included in guitar work. The concept and lyrics that many consider cheesy actually constitutes much of Gloryhammer's appeal, so that can only be counted as a subjective call.\u000a\u000aI may have been quick to call them objectively better (got a bit of a haters gonna hate mentality), but the vocals are in any case top notch. Admittedly they've only got 3 really good songs (The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee, Angus McFife, and The Epic Rage of Furious Thunder)
p5022
aVUgh. I'm so tired of people using "cheesy" as a blanket term to defend any and all power metal. It doesn't mean anything.  It adds nothing to the discussion, its just something power metal fans throw out just because they can. \u000a\u000aAs for haters gonna hate, I don't even completely hate this band like Twilight Force.  I don't even hate them.   I think I gave them a 5/10 on their last album.  The singer is great, but the music is so generic and pointless.  
p5023
aVI wouldn't say people use cheesy as a blanket term, personally I find cheesy to be directed more at the non-serious, campy, overly apparent story work that makes me smile when hearing the music. It's silly and over the top. 
p5024
aVExactly. This is what GH is going for, but it apparently doesn't resonate with everyone.\u000a\u000aOff topic note, GH must be one of the coolest bands to see live, hope they tour Europe some time in the future.
p5025
aVSomeone went through and downvoted you and I. Just as a PSA, downvoting and upvoting aren't representative of 'agree or disagree'. \u000a\u000aPeople seem to forget that. \u000a\u000aRespect other's opinions or you may find less people respect yours.  \u000a\u000aEdit: Furthermore, we're a community of metalheads, we should treat each other with respect since we're here about something we share in common. 
p5026
aVYou have to just kind of expect the downvotes here.  There are a lot of people who just downvote anything they disagree with.  Look at Unlosthorizon's post in the BG post.  He makes a valid point yet he got downvotes.
p5027
aVMetal is a personal thing. Hell, music in general is personal. People mix up criticism of music as criticism of themselves and they get blindly defensive. People need to learn that arguments and debates can be constructive and healthy, not offensive. The critics need to be fair, and the fans need to be accepting. 
p5028
aVIn every social context, the ones who bark the loudest usually win. The correctness of arguments doesn't even matter. This sub is no exception. I don't expect everyone to agree with what I say, but in turn I won't agree with everything they say, either.\u000a\u000aAnd you make another excellent point. When people conduct themselves with complete disregard for the opinion of another, they'll most likely earn no respect in return.\u000a\u000a
p5029
aVMy use of cheesy was not meant to defend GH, I used it to describe the grounds on which they are commonly being discredited.\u000a\u000aTF is bad, minus that one lead single. :D
p5030
aV&gt;The concept and lyrics that many consider cheesy actually constitutes much of Gloryhammer's appeal, so that can only be counted as a subjective call.\u000a\u000aAbsolute bullshit, regardless of it being "cheesy" (an overused term in Power Metal), it's poorly written English, plain and simple. The lyrics in this album, are objectively bad.
p5031
aVWhoa, deja vu...\u000a\u000aYou would have a point if the lyrics were indeed intended to be good. You can't really deride folk-inspired music for having grammatically incorrect lines, since folk-music is often intentionally grammatically incorrect as a sociopolitical statement, i.e. an expression of solidarity with the "common folk" who, at the roots of folk music, were not entirely literate. So these "bad lyrics" are part of GH's lyrical persona.
p5032
aV[For fucks sake.](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/461/903/3a9.png) You're telling me that this album is written poorly, on purpose. Really. You actually believe that they wrote the whole album story and then decided "Hmmmm, this is not folky enough, needs some fucking grammatical errors here and there to 'spice' things up a bit".\u000a\u000aThe only praise I'll ever give to them is for introducing the word "thenceforth" to me. That shit is epic.
p5033
aVWhat I'm saying is that folk music is often written with some extent of grammatical freedom. This is applied *at the time of writing*, not as an afterthought. \u000a\u000aIf you're so hellbent on hating these guys, then just stick to affect-based arguments.
p5034
aVInstrumentally gloryhammer is pretty dry...I'm never that into stuff without interesting instrumental work.
p5035
aVI just discovered them too, love this album. Perfect blend of Rhapsody-esque cheese and great riffs. Doesn't take itself seriously, and I love that.

p5038
aVHey I'm mushmancat, and I'm here to tell you this shitty band hasn't been hiding, they've been way too fucking apparent. You should feel bad for liking them and you should go into hiding yourself. I want to remove the stick shoved up my ass and shove it up the person's ass who decided that creating Gloryhammer was a good idea. I'm mushmancat.

aV[I'll be a mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spHEw2n9LwE)
p5053
aVAgreed, I think another mod or two could be very helpful for the community.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, this subreddit has been very good about self-regulation in the past. We have no rules, and only one mod who doesn't do much. And yet we do pretty much OK. But I suppose now times are changing and we might need to change the structure of the sub.\u000a\u000a(for the record, I'd volunteer to mod, but I lurk more than I post here, soo...)
p5054
aVI second this. We need a more active mod. I'd even go as far as saying we should have *two* new mods.\u000a\u000a
p5055
aVThere is little moderation that needs to be done here.  Very little trolling and hateful content in this subreddit, which is nice.  However, when it happens (times like these), it would be nice if an active moderator was around to do something about it.  That and moderate the flow of posts - when things have nothing to do with power metal (not even power metal related), which I have seen a decent amount of, although not as much recently.\u000a\u000aI am definitely willing to be a mod.  I stop by multiple times a day and I read comments in all threads at this point already.
p5056
aV[this](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/26c5qy/apologies_for_the_disruption_in_mod_duties/) was done a little while back but nothing came of it
p5057
aVI wouldn't mind being a mod if there is need of one.
p5058
aVA agree with the notion that we could use another mod or two. And while I do like things such as discussions and reviews, I don't think we necessarily need mods who will add more content. We need someone to help monitor the subreddit, because /u/SpeakMouthWords can't be watching all the time.
p5059
aVDid you contact the moderator about your concerns first, or did you think this post was a better way to discuss it?  
p5060
aVI don't have concerns, per se. I just wanted to see what the community thought of the idea. 
p5061
aVI think Unlost and Mush would be ideal, they are here regularly and they know about the dynamics of the subreddit.
p5062
aVI believe just being a frequent user/poster isn't enough. I think you've got to be level-headed and not as forceful in offering up opinions. Or as biased towards particular slants of power metal. Or fall-out with members of the community. IMHO both fail *big* time with the last three.
p5063
aV&gt; Biased towards particular slants of power metal\u000a\u000aYou mean Blind Guardian? Because I don't think anyone's going to stop that anytime soon :D
p5064
aVHaha no, long may the BG circlejerk thrive
p5065
aV...jeez, you hate me.\u000a\u000aBesides all that, I don't even want to be a mod. I think I've made it pretty clear that I'm gonna be leaving the subreddit pretty soon, especially once classes start back up again. I do really think that mushmancat is a good candidate for the job. He might have his transgressions every now and then, but I don't think they will continue if he becomes a mod.\u000a\u000aAnyways, this is all moot until we get a bigger census of the sub and SpeakMouthWords' opinion on the matter.
p5066
aVDon't hate you or anyone dude. Got a lot of respect for some of your submissions. Just being honest it's good to raise these things every now and again and get stuff out on the table. Big ol' downsword on the mushmod suggestion though, I don't think the guy could be impartial to save his life.
p5067
aVThe only thing I noticed about mush is that thread of shitty bands he started a while back and that a lot of people hated. I'm now a fan of three of the bands. xD
p5068
aVYou can hardly hate him for having an opinion. I liked about half the bands on his list too. I just think the difference with most people and mushmancat is that he's pretty extreme with his beliefs. Whereas a band like Amaranthe I'm rather indifferent on, mmc will actively hate them and denounce them. But I can't see him being so outspoken on stuff like that if he gets power on this sub.

p5114

p5129
aVI think it is funny... You say 2007? You were a few albums behind. Heart of a Dragon was on Valley of the Damned, a 1999 release. 2006 saw Inhuman Rampage, and the notorious Inhuman Rampage tour.\u000a\u000aAnd during that time, everyone and their mother was shitting on DragonForce, because of some bad sound engineering preventing them from being able to hear themselves during shows. It gave the illusion that they were a studio band, and their reputation as drunkards didn't help.\u000a\u000aAfter Ultra Beatdown, they picked themselves up, kicked ZP out of the band, and picked up Marc Hudson. Much better now. Very few issues at shows.\u000a\u000aI would say yeah, brittle steel and all that NOW, but back in 2007? It was normal for people to talk shit about DragonForce.

I decide to put that song on.  I listen through it and my mind was blown.

V**Subversion: Imperfect** - Tough egg to crack, the band is labeled Technical Symphonic and I'd say that's pretty accurate even if the symphonic elements aren't very symphony. The song goes through a bunch of twists and turns and doesn't seem to stick to one style: djent-y, technical-y, metalcore-y, it's like eating a vertical layered piece of cake, you never know what's coming next. All in all an interesting song if you are into Periphery (the band) because that's my biggest problem with this song, sounds just like Periphery or Monuments.\u000a\u000a**Deus X Machina: The Devourer** - I think what stops this track from being decent power metal are the keyboards, the tone, the melody, it all sounds watered down and boring. It had potential.\u000a\u000a**Dimitriy Pavlovskiy's PowerSquad: Journey** - Snoozefest. Again, bad keyboards.\u000a\u000a**Impellitteri: (Trailer)** - Impellitteri is an old old band that mounts back to Yngwie's style of shredding and it's surprising to see them since the last album I heard from them was Screaming Symphony (which was generic but good overall). This time around they have Dette on the drums who was drumming and slaying with Slayer for a couple of years or something like that. The trailer showcases some good but generic stuff, there's no new shiny rock to be found here, just some good ol' mid paced Heavy Metal.\u000a\u000a**Iron Kobra: Vanguard of Doom** - Short song with that 90s production vibe, just simple old school Heavy Metal.\u000a\u000a**Valor: (Teaser)** - Too short and didn't sound very interesting.\u000a\u000aWhat **I** may have missed last week...\u000a\u000a**Nocturna: Revelations** - Fucking symphonic elements so candy assed it makes Stratovarius sound like Cannibal Corpse in comparison. Whatever good stuff could ever be here it's drowned in keyboard sugar coating.\u000a\u000a**Thundersteel: Outlaws Lament** - The almost obligatory speed metal track that seems to pop up in every weekly releases post. This one is just your standard old school Speed Metal worship.\u000a\u000a[MRW people repost Lost Horizon](http://i.imgur.com/sToIuim.gif)

aVWere you late with the thread, or is it now a thing to post them on Mondays/Sundays? I hope it was just the former. I always like getting them on a Saturday, especially the times when I woke up and there was already new thread up.\u000a\u000aI hope I don't sound ungrateful or anything. Appreciate the effort! Now, as for this week; it's pretty uninteresting to say the least. 
p5145
aVThe post was late. I have 'em ready on Saturday, but I first send it to /u/MadTheMad and /u/omegakindauldron for extra recommendations, so the rule should be to post them on Sunday. Was waiting for omega's recommendations but I guess he's been busy. Anyway, that's why.\u000a\u000aIf everybody would like them on Saturday, I can start one day earlier, no problem.
p5146
aVDeus X Machina, DP's Powersquad, and Impellitteri sound pretty good. Then again I'm way too open-minded as some people put it. Can someone possibly remove Animi from the list and the album art on the right-hand bar? - It's not even power metal. It barely has symphonic elements and just sounds like technical metalcore. (Given I've only heard the lyric video). The Impellitteri album art might be a good replacement. 
p5147
aV&gt; I'm way too open-minded as some people put it\u000a\u000aImpossible to be too open minded. And I'm not sure who picks the album art to use, /u/mushmancat?

asVAny Rhapsody of Fire fans that can help me?
p5150
(lp5151
VI would say they are one of the better-known power metal bands. The creator split off to make another separate group, Luca Turilli's Rhapsody. He took some of the fans with him, and a good bit of the creative energy as well - I felt that LT Rhapsody's debut was stronger than the post-LT Rhapsody of Fire album. LT Rhapsody is also working on a new album they have teased on Facebook.\u000a\u000aI know Rhapsody of Fire did a US tour a year or so ago - not sure if they plan more, or if LT Rhapsody will be around.\u000a\u000aI'd say that this place is as good as any to connect with fans - there are a lot of us around here!
p5152
aVI love Luca Turilli's interviews dude is so enthusiastic and you can see the passion he has for music, also he has a funny english accent. I can't wait to hear Prometheus, Symphonia Ignis Divinus.
p5153
aVI love what I am seeing of this subreddit, but I feel like I would more so enjoy a Subreddit that I could post purely for rhapsody of fire fans, because there is a whole lot that I would love to post about them, but I would feel very awkward posting it all her, as this is a subreddit for Power Metal in general, and I don't want to flood it with pure Rhapsody fanboyism.\u000a\u000aIf I were to make a subreddit for Rhapsody of Fire, or if I could get someone more qualified to jump on it, do you think that it would recieve any support here? I would very much so like to start one or help in ones maturity.
p5154
aVTo be fair, there's enough Blind Guardian and Lost Horizon circlejerk here that some Rhapsody circlejerk could probably do us some good :D
p5155
aVDo you think it would be fine if I posted umm.. a few... dozen... things?
p5156
aVA little while back there were these [Beginner's Guide threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/search?q=guide&amp;restrict_sr=on) that were very popular at the time (not just here but in /r/metal too http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/search?q=guide&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).\u000a\u000a\u000aDoesn't look like someone made one for ROF so if you feel like you're up for it maybe you could give that a try. It'll give you a chance to convey your thoughts on each album and the band as a whole. Then again I don't know exactly what it is specifically you want to discuss about them but I think it could still be a good idea (again if you're up for it).
p5157
aVI'll look into that.
p5158
aVThey are well known among the power metal circle.....however even though known I have come across alot of PM fans that think that ROF is a bit TOO much. I dont mind. I love em! Cheese it up! 
p5159
aVI wouldn't say that they have a massive fanbase, but it depends where you are. If you in the European mainland you will probably have more vision of them than in the UK or US. \u000a\u000aThey are probably as famous as most power metal bands in the UK and US, maybe a little more niche due to their style but if you can find a power metal scene you will be able to find some Rhapsody fans. \u000a\u000aThey aren't one band anymore. They split into two Rhapsody bands. Both are technically Rhapsody, just one has Luca and the other doesn't. Personally I think Luca's guitar makes Rhapsody who they are. Alex's signing is a big part too but Luca us what made me gall in love with them on the Power of the Dragonflame album! 
p5160
aVI don't know how famous they are but they are still doing concerts. I saw them last year as a supporting act for Gamma Ray and it was absolutely amazing. Their singer even did a couple of songs for them.
p5161
aVWhen I was a teenager they were quite famous in Argentina. They played here several times. Now I don't even know if Luca Turilli is still making albums.
p5162
aVI totally agree, I can never get enough of Rhapsody.

VMaybe the best power metal band right now. 
p5166
aVIndeed. Sonata will always be my number one,  but goddamn Theocracy puts on a show. I am a guy who loves melodies and that's what their albums are full of. It's just sad that people seem to be scared to be 'associated' with this kind of music just because of how negative towards some things our world is today. Even if you don't like the lyrics, you've got to admit that they're great! 
p5167
aV&gt; Even if you don't like the lyrics, you've got to admit that they're great! \u000a\u000aGold.

aVThat was probably phrased a LITTLE bit stupidly. My apologies :D
p5169
aVxD

aVIMO, Theocracy plays Sonata Arctica's sound better than Sonata itself does, at least since Days of Grays. 
p5171
aVYay, made it about 6 seconds in.
p5172
aVTheocracy is a fantastic band, and you're missing out if you refuse to listen to them because their lyrics are inspired by their faith. I'm not religious, btw.\u000a\u000aI recommend to all checking out their live-in-studio video of ['Nailed.'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYuJCiJZP08)

p5182
aVIt's just the religion stuff, I find it creepy.
p5183
aVAgreed. I'm an atheist and not a fan of the lyrics either. However, I look at it this way:\u000a\u000aSo many lyrics in power metal are about fantasy, ancient stuff, demons &amp; wizards, mystical themes, good vs. evil, and so on. \u000a\u000aThis religious stuff falls kinda into the same category of fiction/fantasy. To me it's just another set of silly lyrics. I just try to ignore them and enjoy the really good music.

p5192
aV"Point and laugh at me, please."\u000a\u000a-realkman666
p5193
aVA lot of power metal has religious themes, whether it be Paganism/Occultism, Christianity/Demonology, Norse/Roman/Greek mythology, or something else (all of which have had practitioners). If Christian themes hit you the wrong way - Well, different strokes. But if at some point you feel more comfortable with it, I'd take a listen - It is good music.
p5194
aVI love Shadow Gallery, but they're not in your face like that.
p5195
aVThat's a much better comment than your first one. Explaining yourself goes a long way. I don't agree with you, but I can see why you think that way.

aVWhat, would you rather it be Christopher Lee?
p5254
aVI'd rather they just removed the voice acting entirely. Is there a version of the song without it?
p5255
aVSadly there isnt. I remember reading on their forum where someone made this question, and Andreas Blomqvist himself stated that there are no alternate versions.
p5256
aVAnyone with talent i guess. The doctor sounds annoyed by the wife asking him about her dying husband, which is ridiculous. There isnt credible distress in her voice, it really pulls you out of the atmosphere cause its so bad.
p5257
aVWell, we need to remember whoever was doing the narration, wasn't born in an English speaking country so it's going to sound a bit cheesy. I actually like the voice acting, it isn't perfect and the doctor and his wife sound like ordinary people which helps me to become more caught up in the concept.
p5258
aVTo each his own I guess. The sequence where she tells him that its not his kid is for me a great example of just how bad it is. It just feels like 2 people pretending to care.
p5259

"Lament of the Minstrel" and "Enter the Glade" are two other songs. Actually, I am not sure if you can say "Basten to the Floor". Can you say the word basten in that sentence?  \u000aUM: No but you could say "Beaten to the Floor"  \u000aSW: Ok, that does sound better but it doesn't sound as good as "Basten to the Floor". It's not a problem, I will call the song "Beaten to the Floor".\u000a\u000aThat interview is from just before album 2 came out
p5281
aVThis is kind of the only non-perfect song on what is otherwise a perfect album. Just a horrible way for it to end.\u000a\u000aAnd, yeah, the lyrics mean nothing. Falconer just writes vocal lines that sound good and try to fit English words into said vocal melodies.
p5282
aVDespite the lyrics, I really love this song and I think it's great - not the strongest way to end the album maybe, but I've sort of always seen it as a bonus track (in addition to En Kungens Man)

V[Oh boy. This'll go down well](http://i.imgur.com/uo5VfuA.gif)
p5316
aVFirst off: Way more legit than Babymetal. They're at least playing the music instead of dancing in front of it.\u000a\u000aHowever, this doesn't seem like power metal to me. Besides the awful growling, the rhythms they used felt much darker(?) than what are used in power metal. (Does that make sense? I'm not really sure how to phrase that.)
p5317
aVTime for me to chime in.\u000a\u000aFirst off, why compare this to BABYMETAL? This should be compared to other all-female JPM bands like Cyntia, Aldious, and Mary's Blood, or just JPM in general. Comparing it to BABYMETAL is like comparing Pagan's Mind to Amaranthe.\u000a\u000a\u000aSecondly, power metal *is* allowed to be darker. There's plenty of minor scale power metal out there that sounds darker. I'll even give you some JPM examples.\u000a\u000aJupiter - "[Arcadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xQM778WyeE)"  \u000aAldious - "[Butterfly Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la-DglMydVs)"  \u000aVersailles - "[Aristocrat's Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU0uLZWqRdE)"\u000a\u000aRegardless of how you feel about JPM, those are all undeniably power metal songs. They may border on speed metal, but it's the clean vocals that distinguish them from speed metal, which prefers more thrashy styles of vocalization.\u000a\u000aFinally, as for the growls, power metal is slowly leaning towards a greater inclusion of growls recently. Bands like [Crimson Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJh7fSr0cRc), [Viathyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDL26Jl-Vt4), and [Rhapsody of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aItNg5SDX9Q) have all been including more and more harsh vocals in their music (with varying amounts, of course). The line between melodic death metal and power metal is being VERY blurred these days, with bands like [Nothgard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDKfKotvEZ4) and [Primalfrost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99dsIMoVqng) straddling the line between the two subgenres. \u000a\u000aNow to get back on-topic, Bridear primarily uses clean vocals. That's enough for them to not fall under melodic death metal. In addition, their music is fast, melodic, and catchy. I don't even like them, but it's quite absurd to say they're not power metal. They even have the same typical power metal drumbeat going on. If you really want to, I guess you could include metalcore in their description, but to ignore the power metal descriptor just isn't right. Purists might not agree with me, but even the Metal Archives has them listed as "power metal", and we all know how finicky they can be with genres.\u000a\u000aAnd that's my mini-thesis while I wait to take my exam.

aVI'd disagree with this. I haven't heard a lot of the songs from even the most popular bands, and so am constantly finding fantastic stuff through what people post here from popular bands. 
p5340
aVWe see things differently - I think that subreddits like these should be used to discover *new* bands, instead of just upvoting classics. If you find a band you enjoy, I think it should be your responsibility to seek out more material from that band, instead of listening solely to what is posted to /r/PowerMetal or /r/Metal.

aVThat seems to be the case. Though it's worth noting that Hansi and André are technically the only remaining orignal members - Marcus joined up prior to the first album. Frederik, of course, replaced Thomen.

p5354
aVDid they ever have an official bassist? Wiki implies there's only been session bassists (Hansi pulling bass duty in the early years). I always associate Oliver Holzwarth as their bassist.
p5355
aVHansi was their official bassist until he decided to just focus on vocals. Oliver was a long-term guest bassist - the band's given reasoning was that they wanted the slot open if Hansi ever decided to take up being the band's bassist again. I guess he's decided that that's not going to happen.

aVWell, Hansi was their official bassist until Nightfall.  After that it was just session musicians.

sVThis Week in Power Metal Releases (12/8 - 12/14)
p5434
(lp5435
VSo, like I said last week, I'm gonna give this "first impressions" thing a shot, mainly because I want to make sure I don't miss anything crazy good in the last few weeks, and because I don't want to miss anything crazy good when the new year begins. So I'm gonna do this is the memory of /u/MisterMillennia - [rest in peace](http://www.memegene.net/media/created/1xuhv8.jpg). So before I start "reviewing" anything, I think I should note that I'm incredibly un-picky when it comes to my metal. By that, I mean I can listen to any vocal styles, any weird EDM fusions, or even rap parts (Within Temptation reference...). Let's get to it.\u000a\u000aMy opinions (based upon previews only):\u000a\u000a* **Pythia:** Jesus, I never thought I could hear such a good Nightwish clone. Bands like Diabulus in Musica and Xandria are pretty similar to Oceanborn-era Nightwish, but this is almost identical, and it's REALLY GOOD. I'm surprised that they go with the whole D&amp;D lyrical themes, since most of these bands tend to be more gothic with their lyrics, but the music is incredible. I went ahead and checked out another track from the album, "[Sword of Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR8VoVoSXso)", and I'm just convinced further that this album could very well displace someone on my top 10 list of 2014. \u000a\u000aWhat I missed last week (I wasn't even here, you dicks):\u000a\u000a* **Starbynary:** I didn't know why you didn't just link to YouTube for this one; the whole album is already available there (which you can find [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZtgCsRDXvWSaWgHiMi9TF5FMxjclUKNR)). "Dark Passenger" was kind of boring, much like many of the prog/power metal bands I end up hearing nowadays (*cough* Majesty of Revival *cough*). The singing and instrumentation is competent enough, but not so much the songwriting. Now, as for "The Ritual - Modus Operandi -", that's a much better track, mostly because the agonizing subtlety is removed, and it's just a much more straightforward power metal song. I'm getting a weird Power Quest vibe from a lot of the songs, and I'm not a Power Quest fan, but this second track isn't too shabby. The main hook is great and catchy, albeit a little generic Europower-y. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this isn't essential listening for this week, but it might appeal to some people who really like their cheese-smothered power metal.\u000a\u000a* **Unseelie:** Hey, a name I **don't** recognize! And that artwork is fantastic; it definitely reminds me of something like Mirror's Edge, but this track is a little odd. It sounds more like [Angelzoom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsaIYs4Zjc8) than a metal track (Angelzoom is awesome, though). Supposedly, this is a concept album, though, so I don't think it's fair to judge the album from just this one track - it could be a transitional piece. So I decided to check out the album opener, "[Strangers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_ssXDZCfyY)". It's definitely more "metal"; it's even got some harsh vocals towards the end. It looks like this band's forte is atmospheric songs, so in that regard, it's pretty good, but it's not something I'd ever actively listen to. Maybe it'd make for good background music while studying?\u000a\u000a* **PelleK:** Oh, everyone's favorite. I actually didn't think *Ocean of Opportunity* was all that bad, but I generally try to steer clear of his covers and Christmas songs. But this title track is pretty boring. PelleK, like always, makes sure to showcase his singing, but not much else is going on. Also, what's up with that video's aspect ratio? It's not a great first impression, especially for us power metal fans, but I would like to hear more from the album before I totally dismiss it. So I decided to check out "[Tempest](http://vmuzike.net/song/pellek/Tempest)", and it's honestly not that bad. The symphonic passages are pretty epic to say the least, and it's about on par with PelleK's material with Damnation Angels. It's pretty fast, and PelleK seems to actually be using some restraint on his vocals...wait, I spoke too soon. I'll probably give this one a listen sometime this week just to hear how the rest of the album fares. But I would definitely recommend you guys to listen to something other than the title track if you're not impressed with it. It's nothing compared to "Northern Wafer" though.\u000a\u000a/u/SinuataBouquet's highlight:\u000a\u000a* **Epica - "The Fifth Guardian (Interlude)":** - Shit's epic. Three thumbs up. It almost sounds like the melody from [White Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l35sLxu-XJ4) at some points.\u000a\u000a* **Epica - "The Essence of Silence":** Wasn't this the first single they released from the album? I remember listening to it and getting pumped up, because I did not like *Requiem for the Indifferent* at all. But this track sounds like something taken straight from *The Phantom Agony*, and that right there is a good thing. Mark's grunts work so well alongside Simone's operatic leads, and the song is fueled and intense, especially for Epica. Along with *Sacrificium* and *Argia*, this album is definitely recommended to anyone who likes female-fronted symphonic metal. But then again, it's Epica; a certain level of professionalism and talent is to be expected, and it's delivered in spades on this track. My favorite from this album has to be "[Victims of Contingency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7IIYIFljZM)", though. And they even made a video for it pretty recently!\u000a\u000aWell, there was my first "impressions" review. If you have any comments, hatred, misogyny, death threats, or marriage proposals for me, I welcome them.
p5436
aVHey, /u/SinuataBouquet, you forgot [this release](http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Light_Bringer/The_Light_Brings_the_Past_Scenes/472580). It's a DVD release, and I can't find any preview links for it, but I'd still include it. Light Bringer is awesome.

p5439
aV&gt;  a really fucking good singer\u000a\u000a&lt;_&gt;
p5440
aVI don't know why people don't like PelleK, but I love him.\u000a\u000aIt does bring up a point that needs to be addressed here though: there are ways to criticise a band and ways not to; it seems that if somebody here doesn't like a band or a singer they feel the need to act like a dick about it. You guys know who you are. Remember, people are allowed their own opinions and shouldn't receive condescension or barely-veiled abuse because of it.\u000a\u000a/u/Fazermint saying that PelleK should shoot himself in the mouth is both stupid and disrespectful, even if it was said in jest and is one such example of what I'm talking about. There's no reason why we can't have respectful discussions around here.
p5441
aVFair is fair. I'll ease up on the jokes. (Is saying that Blodwen gives you bleeding ears also too far?)\u000a\u000aI appreciate that you called me on this. I avoid bashing people for having opinions, since I hate when that happens to me.

p5444
aVFazermint signing in. A single-release week? This should be quick.\u000a\u000a* **Pythia**: What exactly makes something "gothic"? That genre specification is lost on me, PM is PM. As for the preview, it's pretty cool! Nothing to complain about regarding the vocalist's soprano voice, it's very good. The music is nice and fast, definitely a release I'll look into.  \u000a* **Starbynary**: Two songs in this preview. The first one (Dark Passenger) is pretty boring for progressive metal, and lacks the power vibe. The second one (Dawn of Evil) already sounds a lot better. It isn't mind-blowing stuff, but at least check out this second track.  \u000a* **Unseelie**: Not a very metally track, and it hardly contains any symphonic elements at all. I mean there's synthesizers at one point, that's all. Sure, the woman can sing, but I'd hardly call this symphonic metal.  \u000a* **PelleK**: /u/Mushmancat 's favorite band! Holy shit what is this crap doing on a metal sub. That singer should shoot himself in the mouth. Mushmancat I'm sorry for dissing your top 10 worst bands post, PelleK is exorbitantly crappy. I do like Machinae Supremacy, though. Don't hate me.\u000a\u000aSo, clearly, Pythia is the best release in this post. I appreciate the paragraph on Epica, as I haven't been following their latest releases either. The Fifth Guardian sure is serenity-inducing. Mixed feelings about The Essence of Silence (and Epica in general, really), because they mix soprano with growling. These are two opposite extremes, and they don't really feel congruent to me. I think Epica's much better when the growling is kept to a minimum (WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT THAT). Out of the top of my head, [Storm the Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNoTvg0t52c) would be my favorite Epica track (not that I've listened to them extensively).
p5445
aVWell, if you have the time, will you explain what's so much better about Machinae Supremacy?\u000a\u000aI only ask because i think they're a steaming pile of pop/rock shit and note, i only heard the last album.
p5446
aVWhile Machinae Supremacy's two latest albums have been pretty bad, much of their older stuff is pretty good. I didn't even listen to their latest album because the previews sounded so bad. So, that's a fair opinion.\u000a\u000aIt can be difficult to get into the guy's voice. Still, they've put out some solid stuff. Try [Fury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQusmFshoU8), a pretty fucking sick track. [Thorugh the Looking Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXzHSxYvg-I) is also fantastic. If you want an entire album to check out, I'd say their best one is A View to the End of the World (their last good album). The most notable tracks are the [Title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWTyjXYo_Z8), [Nova Prospect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68hxUjT2Ong), [Rocket Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph_8XslAtwE), and [Force Feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajRvfKLU2b4). \u000a\u000aIt is definitely not every PM fan's cup of tea. It's not the standard PM stuff, so I get that it's not that popular on this sub. What do you think about the tracks I listed? Still shit? :p
p5447
aVJust from a quick glance at the tracks, the ones from "the last good album" are okay songs but i think that no matter how good the instrumentation was on the songs, i would still dislike it just because of the vocals. Not only is the vocalist... bad (read horrible/awful/shitbad), he also manages to sound very amateur with the style he sings and the breathing between lines.\u000a\u000aTruly not my cup of tea... Thank you for the time you took to answer the question and the links provided.

p5449
aVI think he's done some voices for some of their other songs too.

aV[deleted]
p5451
aVIf PelleK had more reasonable prices, I'd be all over that. He rocks hard (in his head) and shreds like a mofo (on video).\u000a\u000aPythia is pretty great, like Dutch GrrrMetal but not boring, a bit of a NW vibe but not pretentious.  \u000a\u000aAnd the French will never accept that their English is painful. Still makes you think of ToT 1.0
p5452
aVAm I the only one getting annoyed by those keyboard parts (I think? I'm not good with instruments) in the Pythia preview? I don't really know how to explain the sound but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. It's first used at 0:42, and is played like every 3 seconds after that. \u000a\u000aIt feels really out of place and just straight out annoys me, and it's ruining the song for me. I do like all the other aspects of it though, which is a shame.

p5465
aVyou talking about [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZGAliokmnI)?
p5466
aVYep!
p5467
aVThis is kind of cheating, but my favorite music video(s) this year was the long-form video made for the [*Symphony of the Vampire*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-_EuVvyAs0) EP by Kamijo. I wish more metal bands would do stuff like this, because I'm a huge sucker for storyline-driven albums and music videos. As an example, I consider *Operation: LIVEcrime* to be the greatest live release of all time.
p5468
aVYeah, I'll have to watch the whole thing. Is there a download in HQ somewhere?
p5469
aVYup, [right here](http://xmsfansub.net/?p=11589) (with subs).
p5470
aV:D
p5471
aVWell, Drink was kind of rubbish and the Elvenking one isn't nearly as cool as The Loser was, so I'm going to have to go with Hector's Hymn. I love the dynamic album art they have in the video, and the cheesy CG of the giant Hector statue is awesome. Altogether, it's probably the coolest video all year.\u000a\u000aI really wish I could have said Halls and Chambers by Falconer, but they haven't made the damm music video yet.
p5472
aVFirst video that comes to mind is [Equilibrium - Wirtshaus Gaudi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYMAgM42pM). I know it's not PM, but it's just fun to watch and great before a night out in the pub.
p5473
aV[I Can't Dance by Sonata Arctica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nukof-nzdXA)\u000aIt's so stupid which is why I love it. It's probably their best video yet, considering there's no cringy CG. 
p5474
aVI still haven't seen Love, got CG too?
p5475
aVI don't think so, but I haven't watched it in a while :P
p5476
aV[deleted]
p5477
aVIt feels weird to see a power metal video that's not a lyrical video. I see almost too of them nowadays, even though I don't blame them because power metal bands probably don't get as much funding as bands/musicians/guys that get autotuned of other genres
p5478
aVEDIT: I also should say it's probably NSFW.\u000a\u000a[Probably not everybody cup of tea...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvCopkWM8E8)\u000a\u000aBut at least, it's not the same shit all bands do where they have the band members pretending to play the song and some bullshit story happening in the back or the vocalist painted creepy looking at you sideways the entire time. Yeah, you can call this is just trying to be edgy but if you listen to the album, it's an exercise in brutality and "disgusting-ness" and i find the music video to be fitting and quite frankly, it was the only one i saw all the way to the end in a long time...
p5479
aVUhhhhh, this is NSFL. I'm pretty jaded when it comes to stuff like this, but I imagine plenty of others aren't. So unless you want some "blackened sludge metal" along with a video just trying to shock the viewer, don't watch this, especially if you're queasy.\u000a\u000aI'd go as far as to call it tasteless. At least a band like [Skeletonwitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBnhx7N1y5Y) understands what subtlety is. The video for "Unending, Everliving" may describe what you wrote in your comment to a T, but at least it doesn't look like outtakes from Begotten or one of the August Underground movies.
p5480
aVIt's important to understand that I only watched this once, I'm not the kind of guy that finds this exciting or appealing or interesting for that matter (not that there's anything wrong with that... maybe a little). However, watching it once left enough of a psychological mark that i recall most parts of it and i haven't had a musical video who had such an impact on me.\u000a\u000aThe video is in fact truly disgusting and some people might not have the stomach (not metal) but it's not tasteless at all. Bands like, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Suffocation, they all are the embodiment of aggressiveness and brutality and their music reflects that but whatever music videos they have ever released are really quite tame, whereas this one fully embraces what they envision in their music, or at least, i feel like it does.\u000a\u000aYou can call it tasteless but this is the first time I've seen a "brutal" band have the balls to create a music video that reflects the songs they've created.
p5481
aV&gt; However, watching it once left enough of a psychological mark that i recall most parts of it and i haven't had a musical video who had such an impact on me.\u000a\u000aBut it's just an arthouse "shock" film. There's plenty of them out there. The music definitely works to its advantage, but I don't understand how leaving a mental scar on you means it's your favorite music video. Of course, I'm not trying to belittle or undervalue your opinion; I just don't understand how disturbing images can equate to your favorite music video.\u000a\u000aOther bands do this kind of gory, psychological shock value thing too. Cattle Decapitation got a lot of press this year for [this music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP1kQ9twFQg) (MAJOR NSFL ALERT). You can't be looking at major signed bands like Cannibal Corpse and Deicide if you want that style of music video.\u000a\u000aBesides, we're on /r/powermetal...at least keep it closely related to power metal when discussing music videos!
p5482
aVI think Cattle Decapitation gets away with that video because it depicts exactly what the lyrics are. It also happens to be one of the best death metal songs i've ever heard.

But I just think he wasn't comfortable with the material yet.\u000a\u000a\u000aOn a side note, Fabio also smokes more than any person I've ever seen. My friend asked him why he smokes so much considering he's, y'know, a classically trained singer and he said something to the effect of: "Singing is too easy for me, so I try to make it a challenge."

asVWhat are your top 3 favorite power metal albums?
p5633
(lp5634
VAt the third place, i'd put **Blind Guardian's Somewhere Far Beyond**. Easily their best album, there are some stuff that i would definitely change in the album but i have been hearing the album on a monthly basis ever since i know about Blind Guardian, in a way it's perfect and at the same time flawed, but just the right "consistency" flaws and perfection (i'm bad at words).\u000a\u000aAt the second place, **Rhapsody's The Power of the Dragonflame**. Some say this isn't that special and it has too much fanfare, fuck them i say, i fucking love fanfare and i think that this is their best album and one that i always come back to. Agony Is My Name is a powerhouse of a song.\u000a\u000aAt first place, **Helloween's Walls of Jericho**. You can argue this is more Speed than Power but i like to think it's both and it's easily one of my top 10 albums of all time, there isn't one weak moment on the album and all tracks are near perfect. Ride The Sky is an example of a song i would call perfect as i would not change anything.
p5635
aVDespite being a big fan of power metal, I've really never listened to much Helloween (other than one of their greatest hits album). I'll definitely give that album a listen in the near future.
p5636
aVWalls of Jericho has some amazing songs but the sound quality is shit. Try keeper of the seven keys, both parts, as well as the dark ride, time of the oath &amp; better than raw.  Honorable mentions: rabbit don't come easy, gambling with the devil, keepers: legacy 
p5637
aVI've been looking for an entry point for Helloween. I'll begin with Walls of Jericho, then. Thx Mad
p5638
aVIt seems to be a common theme among power metal fans that their minds are blown the first time they hear it, and those first few songs are among their favorites for a long time. I know I'm the same way.
p5639
aV* Sonata Arctica - Winterheart's Guild. The culmination of their Strato Arctica days and the beginning of their experimentation. Contains so many great songs, spanning from the high tempo power metal approach on Victoria's Secret and The Cage, to the dark ballads of Gravenimage, The Misery and Broken.\u000a\u000a* Sabaton - Art Of War. The Sabaton album in my opinion. All of their albums are amazing, but this one is so full of the historical based lyrics they have become known for, on top of some truly epic compositions.\u000a\u000a* Helloween - Keeper Of The Seventh Keys Pt. 2. One influence to rule them all.
p5640
aVI still can't stand Broken after all these years.  xD
p5641
aVSonata Arctica got really good at putting albums together as more than just a bunch of songs. Their middle albums have a lot of variation on them.
p5642
aVCompletely agree. Their albums are always better together than just single songs.\u000a
p5643
aV**Honorable Mention: Kamelot - Karma**\u000a\u000a#3\u000a\u000a**Sonata Arctica - Ecliptica**\u000a\u000a#2\u000a\u000a**Blind Guardian - Nightfall in Middle Earth**\u000a\u000a#1\u000a\u000a**Nightwish - Wishmaster**\u000a\u000a\u000a
p5644
aVI walked over to my CD wall and looked and tried to narrow it down. Couldn't. I can't even narrow down my three favorite Falconer albums.\u000a\u000aThis is probably as close as I can get.\u000a\u000a* Twilightning - Delirium Veil\u000a* Human Fortress - Defenders of the Crown\u000a* Angra - Rebirth\u000a\u000a\u000aEDIT: My most *played* albums of all-time are very, very likely:\u000a\u000a* Dragonland - Starfall\u000a* Sonata Arctica - Ecliptica\u000a* Elvenking - Wyrd\u000a* Kiuas - The Spirit of Ukko\u000a\u000aThough I don't think I'd put any of those in my top 10 these days, and I don't think I've listened to the latter three since like 2005.
p5645
aVUpvote solely for Twilightning.

aVO_o One does not simply discover Nightwish at 6-9yo. :p\u000a\u000a+10
p5651
aVWell, I was referring to reckoning night as that was also on my list.
p5652
aVThere was this guy who showed up at a record store where I would hang out instead of going to school. He was bringing the new import Oceanborn, we were all WHOOAAAA.\u000a\u000aThe first time I saw SA for the RN tour, I bought a shirt. The next day, the police stopped me in the street because the driver wanted to know which songs they had played. xD
p5653
aVOnly going to do one album per band... otherwise this post would be entirely Blind Guardian\u000a\u000aBlind Guardian - Nightfall in Middle-earth. My first power metal album, and it remains my greatest love. It could be said that my entire adventure through music has been trying to recapture the emotions I experienced when first listening to this album...\u000a\u000aGamma Ray - Land of the Free. I consider this album to be the finest example of 'pure' power metal. There aren't any tricks or gimmicks here, just raw power metal excellence from one of the genre's founders.\u000a\u000aAngra - Rebirth. For power metal with neo-classical elements, Angra is the best there is, and they've always done a great job of balancing catchy with depth - second only to Blind Guardian, in my opinion. Their South American origin proves to be a boon on this album as they borrow influence from local music.\u000a\u000aHonorable mentions: Kamelot - Epica, Falconer - Black Moon Rising
p5654
aVNightfall in Middle Earth is something to experience. It actually got me to go back and finish reading The Silmarillion, which is an incredible story, and being able to put the songs with the story just made it that much more incredible.
p5655
aVIt's really hard for me to pick just three, as there are probably 3 more I don't want to leave out, but here they are, somewhat in order:\u000a\u000a**Dragonforce - Valley of the Damned**\u000a\u000aThis album is pretty much perfect for me. While I love their later work with ZP, this album had the best blend of songwriting and over-the-top soloing. The bass playing is the best it would ever be for Dragonforce, and every song is exceptionally catchy. Even though I spend a lot of time reviewing music, this is one album where I just don't know how to express how much I enjoy it.\u000a\u000a\u000a**Avantasia - The Scarecrow**\u000a\u000aThis one might be a bit on the edge of the definition of power metal, but for me, it's the best thing Tobias Sammet has ever done. Jorn Lande proves he is the greatest Avantasia vocalist aside from Tobi with his performance on the title track (and others) here. Even though some tracks on this album are incredibly far away from metal, they work in the context of the album. Getting to hear Alice Cooper sing with Tobi was really special for me because Alice is probably my favourite artist of all time.\u000a\u000a**Lost Horizon - Awakening The World**\u000a\u000aThis album gave me a bit of a fresh perspective on power metal. Sure, it should still be catchy and epic, but Lost Horizon's music just sounds "transcendent". It's like something completely different and unique to the band and will never be duplicated again. Daniel Heiman is the most talented vocalist I've ever heard, and his performance is astounding. It almost sounds like he's acting at times with the way he manipulates his voice. 
p5656
aV&gt; The bass playing is the best it would ever be for Dragonforce\u000a\u000aI've seen them many times over the years with several bass players, and Diccon is certainly the best live bass player they've had.
p5657
aVDid you really expect a guitar player to be a good bass player anyway? xD
p5658
aVI've only been listening to power metal for about a year, but here goes. I'm going to limit it to one album per band, otherwise it would just be the same band. \u000a\u000a* **Blind Guardian - Nightfall in Middle-Earth.**\u000aThis is my favorite album, like, ever. If I were to rate all the songs on the album, all but one would get 5/5 stars. Just love this album to bits.\u000a* **Persuader - When Eden Burns.** I only just thought it was 'good' when I first listened to it, but after many listens more and some months later, it has become one of my favorite albums. I would say now that it's 'fantastic'.\u000a* **Sabaton - Carolus Rex.** This one was a difficult choice. I was unsure who to have 3rd but eventually I decided on this album, my favorite from Sabaton. I like most of the songs on this albums, and some of them I just love. \u000a\u000aThis list is definitely be different after a year or so.
p5659
aVFirst I would say:\u000a\u000a**Sabaton - Coat of Arms**\u000a\u000aThis is the album that was a gateway for me into metal, I heard White Death in a discussion about Mosin Nagants, and sort of investigated from there. Before hearing this album, I dismissed a lot of metal as just screaming and distorted guitars, but this album really opened my eyes so it will always be my number one.\u000a\u000aSecond:\u000a\u000a**Sonata Arctica - Silence**\u000a\u000aI fell in love with Sonata after hearing Kingdom For a Heart, but it was Silence that really got me into them. "The Power of One" is such an incredible song and just makes the album for me.\u000a\u000aAnd finally:\u000a\u000a**Blind Guardian - A Twist in the Myth**\u000a\u000aI actually received this album in a sale where you got an assortment of albums that were randomly selected. I had never listened to Blind Guardian much before, I was aware of them but never got into them. When I received this album, I started listening to it on my way to and from work, and it just resonates with me. I especially like "Carry the Blessed Home" and "Skalds and Shadows".
p5660
aVI absolutely love The Power of One. I put Silence on my list as well, it just works so well as a complete album.
p5661
aVVery, very difficult to narrow it down to just 3, but here goes:\u000a\u000a* **Blind Guardian -- "Imaginations from the other side"**. Pretty much the perfect album. This was where the promise of their earlier albums was realised. Of course, "Nightfall..." is equally as good, but I had to pick just one to leave room for my other two selections.\u000a\u000a* **Sabaton -- "The art of war"**. For reasons that seem ridiculous now, I held off on getting this album for quite a while. I was unimpressed by the cover artwork and I'd convinced myself that there was no way it could live up to the magnificence of "Primo victoria" and "Attero dominatus". I was wrong. Very, very wrong.\u000a\u000a* **Angel Dust -- "Enlighten the darkness"**. A band that's always been overlooked, but for me, they were right up there with the best. I loved Dirk Thurisch's vocals and all of the albums after the band reformed were fantastic.
p5662
aV3 **Symphony X - Iconoclast**- The talent in this band is unreal, every member is great at playing what they play. I absolutely love the instrumentation in their albums. Lyrics and vocalist are also awesome. The first track on the album is something I can never get enough of. I know it's more prog, but idc bro.\u000a\u000a2 **Lost Horizon - A Flame to the Ground Beneath**\u000aI have two "Highlander" tracks in my library so I hear it more often.\u000aProbably the most powerful of Power Metal albums. Motivating as hell. As one reviewer said "Where death or thrash music can make you feel angry, this album makes you feel like a god"\u000a\u000a1 **Reckoning Night - Sonata Arctica**\u000aMy favorite of Sonata Arctica's works. What I consider their magnum opus, awesome lyrics and feel all over the place. First thing I bought from the CD store when I visited Japan so I could get the JPN digipak with Wrecking the Sphere. Not ridiculously powerful, but it does amazing at what Sonata is (was?) good at, melancholic powerish metal with interesting themes and lyrics. Every song on here, with possibly the exception of The Boy who Wanted to be a Real Puppet, is amazing lyrically and instrumentally.\u000a\u000a**Honorable mentions:**\u000a\u000aFirewind's Between Heaven and Hell\u000a\u000aCrystal Eyes' Chained\u000a\u000aIced Earth's Horror Show\u000a\u000aDream Evil's Dragonslayer\u000a\u000aSonata Arctica's Ecliptica/Silence/Winterheart's Guild\u000a\u000a**and more recent amazing stuff (IE they would be on this list if the nostalgia factor wasn't there):**\u000a\u000aBorealis' Fall from Grace\u000a\u000aInstanzia's Ghosts\u000a\u000aCellador's Enter Deception\u000a\u000aPrimalfrost's Prosperous Visions\u000a\u000aViathyn's Cynosure\u000a\u000aKeldian's Outbound
p5663
aV&gt; possibly the exception of The Boy who Wanted to be a Real Puppet\u000a\u000a:O
p5664
aVThat's the token sort-of-out-of-place song on there. 
p5665
aVThe instrumental is what I would leave out, and I'm still not a big fan of Blinded.
p5666
aVI didn't like blinded until I started listening to For The Sake of Revenge's live CD a bunch. Then it grew on me.\u000a\u000aThese days even the boy who wanted to be a real puppet (say that 5 times fast) is growing on me
p5667
aVI find the first guitar solo very grating, but the song evolves in a good way. It's the only SA album that I hated on the first listen. :S
p5668
aVIt's hard to pin it down since these things always change, but right now:\u000a\u000a#3 Galneryus - Resurrection\u000a\u000aBasically what I'm looking for in modern power metal. Best one from Galneryus (especially their closing song), best solos concentrated on a single album for me. It helps when like 3 out of the 5 band members are musical geniuses.\u000a\u000a#2 Timeless Miracle - Into the Enchanted Chamber\u000a\u000aI swear if these guys announce a new album I'll shriek like a twelve year old fangirl. You can't beat classics like "Curse of the Werewolf", "Return of the Werewolf" and "The Red Rose".\u000a\u000a#1 Sonata Arctica - Ecliptica\u000a\u000aPower metal climaxed for me at this one. I know they're basically worshipping Stratovarius here but none of the Stratovarius albums hold a candle to this one (not Visions that's for sure; maybe Infinite). I can't name another album that has so much energy - I can't describe it better - flowing through it that the band members can barely contain it. Also I don't know how many times this album has been copied by european power metal bands. 
p5669
aVLinky to the tribute in which Timeless Miracle is coming back:\u000ahttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouerghrecords/a-tribute-to-sonata-arctica-album-release
p5670
aVTimeless Miracle have actually very recently come back. They are recording a Sonata Arctica cover for a tribute album and then will likely be releasing a second album.That shrieking you just made...i did the same :D
p5671
aVGreat to see another Galneryus fan, such an underatted band imo.
p5672
aVIt's a tough one, but one I'm confident in.\u000a\u000a**Nightfall in Middle Earth - Blind Guardian**\u000a\u000aAlthough a lot of people have this on their list as well, for me, this is the album that defines Blind Guardian to me. It has the big, epic sound on tracks, it retains the trashy moments, it has the slower ballads, and yet everything works out on this album.\u000a\u000a**The Metal Opera - Avantasia**\u000a\u000aThe Power Metal album that got me into concept albums. Amazing story, amazing songs, and it got me to go back and listen to Kiske-era Helloween as well as go out and search for bands similar to this style (such as Ayreon)\u000a\u000a**Something Wicked This Way Comes - Iced Earth**\u000a\u000aPower and Thrash unite! It's the album I recommend to every new fan of Iced Earth as well as to fans of Power Metal in general.\u000a\u000a**Honurable Mentions;**\u000a\u000aBlack Sun - Primal Fear, Fourth Legacy - Kamelot, Keeper of the Seven Keys Part 1 - Helloween, Powerplant - Gamma Ray
p5673
aV3 - Powerwolf - Blood of the Saints\u000a\u000a2 - Hammerfall - Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken\u000a\u000a1 - Blind Guardian - At the Edge of Time
p5674
aVGamma Ray - Power Plant\u000a\u000aRhapsody - Power of the Dragonflame\u000a\u000aBlind Guardian - At the Edge of Time
p5675
aVI was thinking about this on the way home from work the other day. If I had 3 albums to try to make someone a fan of power metal, which ones would I choose? As music that makes me feel things that nothing else really can, it's an inspiring and rejuvenating part of my life - a form of therapy in itself. \u000a\u000aAnyways, I'll cut to the chase. My top 3 (in no particular order are):\u000a\u000a**Dragonland - Starfall**\u000a\u000aThe first power metal song I ever heard was "Storming Across Heaven" by Dragonland, and I was instantly hooked - something my brain had never heard before. While the rest of that album is a little above mediocre in my opinion, Starfall (as of now) is my favorite album by them. This prog/power masterpiece has no shortfalls. From the beginning to the end, I'm taken on a journey through almost every feeling in the emotional spectrum.\u000a\u000aThe keyboards and guitar on this album are exceptional. If power metal has gotten stale for you recently, then I recommend checking this album out if you haven't already.\u000a\u000a**Firewind - Between Heaven and Hell**\u000a\u000aBeing the first power metal I ever owned, it was one hell of an introduction. Every song is spectacular. Gus G is on point in every solo, and each song has its own unique catchiness to it. The choruses on this album epitomize the bombastically emotional hook that has kept me a fan of this genre for many years. Personally, I think this album is Gus's best work. I only wish this lineup had stayed together over the years.\u000a\u000a**Avantasia - Metal Opera Pt. 2**\u000a\u000aThis was another one of the first power metal albums I ever owned. I think this is Avantasia's best work. The first song, "The Seven Angels," is one of my all time favorites. The rest of this album is gold as well. I like this a lot more than "The Metal Opera Pt. 1."
p5676
aVBetween Heaven and Hell? But... but... The Premonition, man. It's almost like people can have a different opinion to me...
p5677
aVPremonition for me had some weak tracks. It's got some great hooks though.\u000a\u000aAlso whenever I listen to Mercenary Man I can't help but hear "Paint with all the colors of the Wind" from Pocahontas during the chorus.\u000a\u000aNo, that can't be unheard. (I still love that track btw, it's just funny that it sounds similar)
p5678
aVHah, fair enough. For me, while it does have some weaker tracks, it's nothing I'd actually skip. A lot of gold though.
p5679
aVThis is a great "indie" or lesser known list. Seems like you kind of skipped all the big bands on purpose with this list.
p5680
aVOr, you know, those are his favorites.
p5681
aVLesser known bands totally headline wacken all the time....
p5682
aVUgh this fucking community is sooooo metalhipster. 
p5683
aVNo, you not having a clue what your talking about while others do does not qualify as "hipster". If he named Moonville, Aethra, and Ultimatium youd have a point, but all three of the bands he listed are very well known by anyone with anything more than the most basic knowledge of power metal, and Tobias Sammet and Avantasia are among the biggest names in the genre. [This is not the stage show of a lesser known band.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcL1prrTFLY)\u000a\u000aGoing around criticizing people's picks when you most likely can only name the bands in the sidebar makes you look like a fucking idiot. So just stop.  
p5684
aVExactly the response I expected.
p5685
aVYou think you won that, but really, you didn't.
p5686
aVThis is not hipster at all :P these are pretty well known bands.
p5687
aVObey the sidebar. Right?
p5688
aVYeah, honestly, these are my favorite albums even compared to those by Blind Guardian, Stratovarius, Lost Horizon, etc... They just had an impression on me that the more known bands didn't.
p5689
aVO_o
p5690
aV**1 Lost Horizon- A Flame to the Ground Beneath** - Better everything than everything else. \u000a\u000a**2 Lost Horizon- Awakening the World**- LH was a perfect storm of everything I look for in power metal. \u000a\u000a**3 Edguy- The Savage Poetry**- The Shawshank Redemption of movies.  One of the tracks will come up on random and i'll have no choice but to listen to the album in its entirety. 
p5691
aVCompletely agree with Lost Horizon. That band is one in a million. 
p5692
aVAngra - rebirth\u000a\u000aKamelot - black halo\u000a\u000aAnd uhhh..\u000a\u000aAvantasia -metal opera pt 2
p5693
aVWhy part 2?
p5694
aVProbably because of Seven Angels. Love that song, so good
p5695
aV**1. Rhapsody - Power Of The Dragonflame** - To me, this is the culmination of Rhapsody's creativity. This album has a perfect balance of aggression, flair, melody and orchestrations, with always perfect vocal performance to Fabio Lione to top it off. The other, often overlooked, aspect of Rhapsody are their lyrics. Some people tend look really superficially at them and not take them seriously because they are fantasy, but there are some masterfully crafted and beautifully poetic lyrics here.\u000a\u000aFrom the great description of rage and anger in Knightrider Of Doom...\u000a\u000a"IN THIS BLOODY DAWN\u000a\u000aI WILL WASH MY SOUL\u000a\u000aTO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE\u000a\u000aTO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER\u000a\u000aTO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL\u000a\u000aAND TO BE THE SON OF DOOM..." \u000a\u000a...to strength of human spirit in Steelgods Of The Last Apocalypse...\u000a\u000a "Raise all your eyes to the autumn skies\u000a\u000acapture the energy of that sight\u000a\u000aThey can have fun with my limbs and bones\u000a\u000abut I swear my spirit will never fall"\u000a\u000a...or powerful images of destruction and death from Agony Is My Name... \u000a\u000a"Black is the rose that's now in my hand\u000a\u000ablack for the blood of the fallen\u000a\u000asymbol of death will soon be reborn\u000a\u000ainto the life of my tears' fall...\u000a\u000areborn and grow!"\u000a\u000a...they blend perfectly with the music to offer a truly unique journey into the wonderful world of the Enchanted Lands.\u000a\u000a**2. Helloween - The Dark Ride** - If it is true that Helloween were pressured by their record company to release a darker album then the record company had it right for once. This album contains everything that is good about Hellowen. From funny and happy songs like Mr. Torture, to hymns like All Over The Nations, heavy Mirror Mirror or one of the best ballads ever written in If I Could Fly. Not only does this album not contain a single filler song, there is not a second of this album that I wish was made differently. Simply prefect from start to finish. \u000a\u000a**3. Wuthering Heights - Salt** - I've known about this band for a long time, but I'd never listened to them until fairly recently and I wished to kick my self in the nuts for waiting so long after I gave just one listen to this masterpiece. It might seem to some like another one of those pirate themed albums from seeing the cover or reading the title, but Salt is something else entirely. It is not a concept album in a traditional sense, but the motif of salt is used throughout as a metaphor(salty tears, sea etc.) for life's troubles. The music is a great blend of power and folk metal quite unlike anything I've heard before. And vocalist is the great Nils Patrik Johansson, who zou might know from Civil War and Astral Doors.
p5696
aVThat's not even a Helloween album!
p5697
aVCome again?
p5698
aV*uh oh...*
p5699
aV**3 HammerFall - Infected**\u000a\u000aWhaaaat, Infected? But *everyone* hates that album! Well, I guess they do, but that's because they're too busy crying about Hector and zombies to actually *listen to the music*. And once you do listen, you realize that Infected is the best that HammerFall has ever done. Also, (r)Evolution, fine album, but what the fuck were they thinking with that name.\u000a\u000a**2 Kiuas - The New Dark Age**\u000a\u000a*Fire rains down from the heavens, pouring down on those too weak to learn...*   This was the chorus that made me fall in love with Kiuas, and this album is really them at their best. A close second here would be Lustdriven, but I think that The New Dark Age is just a whee bit better.\u000a\u000a**1 Falconer - Falconer**\u000a\u000aHonestly, all of the Falconer albums for me are top notch, best of the best. But I have to choose one, so I'm choosing the most classic of them all. It has the greatest chain of Falconer songs (*Upon The Grave of Guilt* --&gt; *Entering Eternity*) and is consistently awesome. Although *Northwind* and *Among Beggars and Thieves* are close contendors for this, I think I really just have to give it to *the* classic album.
p5700
aVI agree with you on Hammerfall. That's my personal favorite of theirs as well.\u000a\u000aKiuas' debut is like my second or third most played album ever. I couldn't get into *The New Dark Age*\u000a\u000aAnd you know Falconer is my favorite band, but I think the self-titled may be their weakest album (with Mathias). Maybe I'm crazy. That wouldn't be in my top 4 of theirs :-O
p5701
aVOdd nitpick but; if you're going to defend Infected because people can't get past the cover, how can you argue the (r)Evolution album's name?\u000a\u000aAnyways, looks aside, Infected is their weakest album. Music wise, lyric wise, sound wise, it's an album I don't go back to at all in the Hammerfall discography.
p5702
aVBut the fact that some people will dismiss Infected because of the cover and theme is the issue that I have. I do think that it's a sort of subconscious bias that people have against Infected, because it really is a great album if you go into it with an open mind. But since people were already suspicious of it (and since we hate change ;D), most people ended up not liking it.\u000a\u000aI personally like the (r)Evolution album, but it's still a stupid name for an album. Like, I could totally criticize Infected for its theme, which is fair, but that's not a reason to dislike the album. As such, I don't really think I'm being a hypocrite here. If I were to say I don't like (r)Evolution *because* of its name, then that would be hypocritical. But I like the album fine, and I'm reasonably able to say that it's a dumb name. Also, it's not like I'm dissing HammerFall or anything, I obviously like them, they took spot 3 on my list.

aVNo particular order.\u000a\u000a**Versailles - JUBILEE**\u000a\u000ai dont know the opinion of the community about versailles, many should think they're just some other visual band with fanfares, but i really like their concept of "absolute beauty of form and the extremes of aestheticism" that they brought to their music and style, this album is also really emotional because of the death of the bassist during the recording of JUBILEE, every song on this album is a creative pearl, that i'll never get tired of listening, ignore the stereotypes and go ahead to listen Versailles, you will find a great symphonic power metal band.\u000a\u000a*Recommended Song(s): Catharsis / Aito Kanashimino Nocturne\u000aMy personal favorite: God Palace*\u000a\u000a**Rhapsody - Symphony of Enchanted Lands II (yes, the second one!!)**\u000a\u000aas you see, i really love fanfarres. i confess that the album gets to repetitive sometimes (last angel's call and shadows of death, specifically) but this is my favorite rhapsody album, from the band that introduced me to the power metal world, thank you emerald sword related link on yt!\u000ai think everyone have listened this album, so w/e\u000a\u000a**Galneryus - Beyond the End of Despair**\u000a\u000aa really really power metal album now. every single track here is powerful and exciting, syu is a monster of guitar, he makes it speaks with you and you can feel it, the best vocal performance of Yama-B on galneryus, on this album he feels more comfortable then trying to be high pitched like on Flag of Punishment, anyway a great album from start to the end.\u000a\u000a*Recommended Song(s): Shriek of the Vengeance / My Last Farewell\u000aMy personal favorite: Shiver*\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSpecial mention to: BG - Nightfall on Middle-Earth, Kamelot - The Ghost Opera and Angra - Temple of Shadows.

It is, in my opinion, the perfect power metal album.\u000a\u000a2) **Nightwish - Century Child**\u000a\u000aCentury Child isn't even my favorite Nightwish album, but I don't think it would be fair or accurate to classify Imaginaerum, Once, or Dark Passion play as power metal.  That said, I think it's a tremendously good listen, and it improves on Wishmaster in every way.\u000a\u000a3) **Cain's Offering - Gather the Faithful**\u000a\u000aJani Liimatainen's post-SA effort is cinematic, epic, and cheesy.  In other words, it makes for some terrific power metal.  I'm hopeful that they might one day reform and release a new album.

aVIn no particular order:\u000a**Carolus Rex** by Sabaton. I really enjoy concept albums and this one tells a great story. It's a good history lesson and there are some subtle differences in the lyrics and song meanings between the English and Swedish versions. The variation in feeling isn't quite as strong on this one but it does in some points get across the atmosphere of the 1600s and 1700s, most notably in the introduction and the title track.\u000a\u000a**Dark Assault** by Iron Savior. The atmosphere is excellent and the songs really get the mood and the story across. This is another album where the feelings of different songs are organized very well and build up some tension to the final tracks, Back into the Light and After the War.\u000a\u000a**Silence** by Sonata Arctica. This isn't a concept album but it still feels like a cohesive unit. The song order and transitions between different feelings on this album work incredibly well. The contrasts between adjacent songs are stark and the album builds up song after song until 50 minutes in, the finale The Power of One begins. It's a dark album overall and a great one to listen to in the winter.\u000a\u000aHonorable mentions:\u000aV by Symphony X\u000a\u000aElysium by Stratovarius\u000a\u000aNo World Order by Gamma Ray\u000a\u000aUnification by Iron Savior\u000a\u000aEcliptica by Sonata Arctica\u000a\u000aThe Black Halo by Kamelot\u000a\u000aOceanborn by Nightwish

aVI may just be on a little kick but...\u000a\u000a1. Galneryus - Advance to the fall\u000aThis album just has everything i could want in a power metal album aside from a medieval sounding sing along of course lol. Very melodey and keyboard reliant while still maintaining that aggressive edge. PLus yama B's singing is always top notch just a classic.\u000a2. Blind Guardian - Somewhere Far Beyond\u000aNothing else i can realy say about this album that hasn't already been said here. Probably my most listened to album of all time.\u000a3. Theocracy - Self Titled\u000aNow i will preface this by saying i am not the most religious person, so the themes of Matt's lyrics dont really bother me that much. Considering that he pretty much wrote this himself it is a fantastic album. The choruses are always in my head for days after i listen to it. The small imperfections that the recordings give it a nice charm to it aswell. With the remastered version with real drums out now my love has only grown.
p5713
aV**3rd place: Fairyland - Score to a New Beginning**\u000aFairyland's final album is better than their previous two put together. It's one of those albums I usually want to listen all the way through rather than listening to separate tracks randomly. It's got a very impressive line-up with like 7 guest vocalists, genius musical composition, super-uplifting melodies and symphonic elements. The title track is so good it's unreal, it's so uplifting and so incredibly fantastic. Assault on the Shore is equally fantastic, and most of the rest of the tracks are great.\u000a\u000a**2nd place: Masterplan - Aeronautics**  \u000aJørn Lande is my favorite vocalist, ever. The guy is so incredibly talented and is just the king of metal. Everything he touches turns into gold. Aeronautics is pure gold, tons of kick-ass tracks.\u000a\u000a**1st place: Heavenly - Virus**  \u000aThis album is the epitome of power metal, imo. The opening song (The Dark Memories) is just insane and is pretty much my favorite song ever, in any genre. It's got the catchy Spill Blood on Fire and the super badass title track. The first 8 tracks are top-tier stuff, most consistent album I've ever listened to.

p5733
aVOh, you're propably right. I was kinda confused, because a band called Raubtier is singing in Swedish (i think) and it sounds nothing like this Tyr song. But maybe that's because i have nothing to do with any of nordic laungages, so i don't really know what i'm talking about. All i know is that it sounds lovely.
p5734
aVIt depends a lot on the context, Faroese and Icelandic are very different from the other Nordic languages(Danish, Norwegian and Swedish) that are more similar to each other. Some can be understood, but some is just down-right incomprehensible.\u000a\u000aAnd yeah, Raubtier sings in Swedish.

p5739
aVElaborate? I've never met the guy.
p5740
aVI saw him outside a show in Denver. He was about as enthused talking to his fans as if he was watching paint dry while the other members were being very friendly and excited. I didn't really care because I'm not a big fan (plus I got to meet one of the guys from Metsatoll who was super cool). During Tyr's set he was even less exciting. He looked obviously pissed off and bored and his vocals were really off. Probably because he had to open for two other bands (Moonsorrow and Korpiklaani) and no one was there to see him. I would expect more out of an established musician, but still I didn't really care. However, the next day I was shown an interview where he more or less referred to actual pagans (I.E. most if his fan base) as crazy idiots and that the whole pagan thing is just fiction. Gaahl would behead him. Better yet, Johan Hegg, who is also an atheist, would never denounce paganism publicly. Not a cool thing to write off half your fans as crazy and declare your lyrical content as, more or less, a joke. I hope that clarifies my point enough. Let me just say that if you like Tyr musically you should definitely listen to Ensiferum and Wintersun.
p5741
aVI saw about half their set in Glasgow (opening for Korpiklaani and Sabaton). They were competent anyways. I can see what you mean about him being a dick though. Ah well, I guess he should stick to singing :)
p5742
aVWe'll give him the benefit of having to compete with Korpiklaani and Sabaton live. Those two might be the two most entertaining live bands ever, each in their own unique way too!
p5743
aVWhat do you mean by "actual pagans"? If you mean people who actually believe Odin and Thor exist I highly doubt that's most of their fan base. 
p5744
aVWhat do you mean "asshole"? He seems pretty nice on facebook.
p5745
aVI probably should have defended that statement within my original post. I've already ranted enough. please read above. It's of course all my own perception and opinion. 
p5746
aVHonestly, he used to be really cool and he still sort of is depending on what day you get him and who else is around.\u000a\u000aI think his problem is that he thinks he's smarter than everyone. About everything and every topic. I don't know if he really is or not, but he has a very pretentious/smug attitude that's pretty obvious once you talk to him for more than 5-10 minutes.\u000a\u000aI respect the hell out of the guy, but he's been kind of a dick the last few years. I agree. A lot of it changed once *By The Light of the Northern Star* came out. They had a bit of success and totally changed their style (I feel like I always tell the story when I asked him about that album moving away from the progressive sound and he said, straight-faced, "We made the album more accessible so we could make more money."). That's why I really like Heljareyga right now, that's his passion project.\u000a\u000aAs for Gunnar is the happiest bassist I've ever seen. Agreed. Although he did try to [rip my head off](https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t31.0-8/170244_650911006989_3053345_o.jpg) about four years ago. I'm not thaaat small. He's massive.\u000a\u000a\u000aSource: Have been chatting with Heri for 7-8 years (Facebook until *The Lay of Thrym* album, now just when they come to town). He's become kind of a dick.

I won't get into it though since I'll get majorly downvoted for not having Lost Horizon in my top 3 (or top 5 for that matter). In my opinion, the two best power metal albums *ever* were released that year and Lost Horizon wasn't one of them.\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd 2008 was a weak year?! There's at least like. . .6 albums I'd put ahead of 2 of your top 3 there :-/ Falconer, Avantasia, Secret Sphere, Revolution Renaissance (I know, I know, I'm the only one that *loves* that album), Stormwarrior, Leverage. . .\u000a\u000aEDIT: Maaaaaybe Rage (the title track was great!), maaaaybe Saint Daemon.

aVI suggest starting chronologically with Crystal logic(skipping their first two albums). Open the gates is my favorite though. \u000a\u000aI'd also warn to not give up on them right away if they don't click at first. The vocals can be offputting. It also took me quite awhile to appreciate their brand of epic sound. Once it clicks though, its so worth it. \u000a\u000a
p5789
aVI saw Manilla Road live a couple years back and was really impressed (having not heard them before but being aware of the reputation) But have put off getting their albums for so long. I finally picked up Open the Gates last week and I have to say, it's probably going to (as you said) take a few spins through to really let it sink in. But I also finally picked up Abigail by King Diamond. So my attention has been slim towards anything else.

aVI'd forgotten about Battle of the Ivory Plains.....*shudders*
p5793
aVAgreed. *Starfall* may be my #3 power metal album of all time. Very likely my most listened over the past 10 years.
p5794
aVStarfall is my #5. Cynosure by Viathyn recently took over #2.
p5795
aVWhat, but it has Supernova and The Old House On The Hill..
p5796
aV2 songs a good album does not make
p5797
aVAll the songs on the album are good but the two I mentioned are just something else. Is Starfall not as good of a recording quality as Astronomy? That may be my problem with it
p5798
aVIt's older, do they probably had less money to spend on production 
p5799
aVWhat about Theocracy's Mirror of Souls on 08? And Cellador's Enter Deception on 06? What about Titan Force? Fifth Angel?\u000a\u000aCool list, i would replace a bunch of stuff though. The Stratovarius mention though, i would have never expect, they are so overrated in my opinion and sadly, the ones who brought flower metal to this world. A good case of an excellent guitarist getting eclipsed by a bunch of noodle wankery keyboarding and flowery melodies.\u000a\u000aAlso, which year did you thought had the better 3 releases? I'm gonna say it was 85, i would put Jericho at the top but fuck, that year saw some of the best power metal and heavy/speed that had that power metal vein.
p5800
aVHoly shit. I just straight up forgot to put Mirror of Souls. Thanks for reminding me.\u000a\u000aAs for best 3. For me its 88, 93, 89, 85. 
p5801
aVTitan Force in 1989 for sure. That's a top 3 album.\u000a\u000aI think that's the year. On my phone, in bed, too lazy to look it up.
p5802
aVGood USPM picks. I dont really care for european power metal save for Running Wild and bands oriented towards 80s uspm.\u000aI kind of expected Awaken The Guardian to be in your top 3 for 1986 but it is not. In my opinion its the best album ever made.\u000a\u000aPharaoh's Longest Night is prob my favorite power metal album of the last decade.\u000aHave you heard Antiquus? I think their second especially is great.\u000a

They're the most aggressive power metal I know, being closer to thrash if it weren't for their awesome singing.

V**[Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep1B_aIFPDE)** - This is still getting daily listens!\u000a\u000a**[Orden Ogan - Ravenhead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZrT_w2TAIU)** - The reaction to this didn't seem to be that great, and it's not a fantastic album, but an enjoyable one.\u000a\u000a**[Triosphere -- The Heart of the Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UEbe33MJx0)** - A favorite album from last year.\u000a\u000a**[Kamelot - Silverthorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSylbQEHhVo)** - The recent Kamelot news has returned me to listening to this album. Love it, easily tied for best Kamelot album with...\u000a\u000a**[Kamelot - Epica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO7r4Oc3gfk)** - Some fantastic and classic songs on this record.\u000a\u000a**[Steven Wilson - Hand. Cannot. Erase.](https://soundcloud.com/steven-wilson/first-regret-3-years-older)** - Moving away from power metal now, this is the wonderful new solo album from prog rock maestro Steven Wilson. Seriously check it out.\u000a\u000a**[Periphery - Juggernaut Alpha/Omega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sNIbcqxYL0)** - It's djent. It's pop. Some people find those things horribly offensive, but I enjoyed these.\u000a\u000a**[Summoning - Old Mornings Dawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-wZTxJoDCQ)** - Quite a nice album. Very atmospheric.
p5905
aVI was a little lukewarm on the new Orden Ogan at first, but it grows on me with each listen. I don't even mind "Evil Lies In Every Man"'s intro anymore.
p5906
aVAlright, [here's](http://tapmusic.net/lastfm/collage.php?user=MarsDragoner&amp;type=7day&amp;size=5x5&amp;caption=true) mine. I can see you also listened to Noble Beast! Holy crap, I still cannot believe their awesomeness. This album is just sooo good, I almost hate myself for ignoring all the time until now.\u000a\u000aI made a little visit to Dubsteb this week with Nero (is it even dubsteb?). Anyway, I knew them for quite a while and it was mainly the "oh, I kinda miss these dudes" factor that pushed me to listen to the whole thing and I have to say I enjoyed it more than I thought. It's badass. Well, apart from that, I discovered quite a few new Power Metal bands this week. Vorpal Nomad is the band of this dude who makes the covers of ALL Power Metal releases. You know exactly who I mean (*cough* hooded men *cough*).\u000a\u000aI want to talk about the new Manilla Road. Please. It's out for more than two weeks now and nobody seems to care. It's a shame. the first half of the album is at least comparable with their old stuff. Seriously, give it a listen.\u000a\u000aEdit: Also, Dragonsfire is an awesome neat Traditional/Power Metal band from Germany with cheesy coolness and good riffs and stuff. Enjoyed all of their stuff. Unfortunately their bassist and vocalist died last week, R.I.P. ...
p5907
aVSo I'm going to post [my collage](http://i.imgur.com/jO3Ht0Z.jpg) once again, because why not. I was trying to get into Kamelot's other album than The Black Halo and no. It's not going to happen. The Black Halo is too good and I can't accept that their others album aren't even as half as good as Halo. You can also see Merging Flare here and I still can't get enough of this album. It's amazing. Wasn't expecting that much awesomeness from this band. Seventh Wonder is also my recent discovery and this album is sometimes too sad for me. Can't handle the feels sometimes. Ravenheart - Valley of the Damned is basically Freedom Call-ish band, but their debut is incredible and especially [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIGRof8l1HE). And I think you know the rest.

p5911
aVYou know what is the worst thing about listening to them? The worst is that you know that there will never be another album.
p5912
aVBut Karma and Epica are both as good, if not better than The Black Halo
p5913
aVI'll listen to these albums again. Maybe something will break with me. But their first album is just bad. You can't deny it.
p5914
aVfirst definitely is bad, but starting with The Fourth Legacy is where they got really good. Fourth Legacy, Karma, and Epica are all great albums (although I reckon Fourth legacy is the weakest), and are very similar in style to the Black Halo. I'd be surprised if you didn't like them
p5915
aVYou were right. Karma is so damn good. Forever is my second favourite song from them now. Thanks!
p5916
aVFinally gave Noble Beast a spin, and man is it glorious.\u000a\u000aAlso can't go a week without RoF - Emerald Sword, Fairyland - Score to a New Beginning, or Heavenly's Virus album
p5917
aV**Orden Ogan - Ravenhead** makes me sad that I just got this album a week ago, but worth the wait. Catchy and fun, so I'm going back to listen to their older material and see if it can catch me.\u000a\u000a**Edguy - Savage Poetry** remember when Edguy made amazing music? This album proves that Edguy was once on top of their game.\u000a\u000a**Brainstorm - Downburst** always dig listening to these guys every so often and they've gotten a few more listens as of late with their style of PM.\u000a\u000a**Demons and Wizards - S/T** amazing album. Not enough can be said about this album.\u000a\u000a**Iced Earth - Framing Armageddon/Crucible of Man** these albums often get a bad rep, but I thoroughly enjoyed going back and listening to these back to back, much like Metal Opera I and II.\u000a\u000a**Metallica - Kill Em All** sometimes you hear a song off of an album and you want to listen to the whole album. Great album and a rare album where there isn't a weak song on the album (except maybe the bass solo...)
p5918
aVLove this idea.\u000a\u000aHere's [mine](http://tapmusic.net/lastfm/collage.php?user=Paranoid2028&amp;type=7day&amp;size=3x3&amp;caption=true) still very similar to last week overall.\u000a\u000aBeyond the Space, Beyond the Time is still a daily listen at this point and Awakening the World and Tales of Ancient Prophecies get a couple of their tracks played every day at the moment too. In fact, it's a similar story with Symphony of War and Element pt1.\u000a\u000aI gave The Last Sons of Perylin a spin the other evening. Not quite sure what i make of it though but i usually need a few listens before i decide whether i like an album or not.\u000a\u000aI checked out the opening track on Cradle to the Brave and liked it but i didn't have time to listen to the whole album at that point and then i promptly forgot about it completely, so i'll have to get stuck into that fairly soon too.\u000a\u000aLast couple of days i've had Battalions of Fear on because my Blind Guardian discography is basically just Somewhere Far Beyond, Imaginations From The Other Side and Nightfall in Middle Earth. I'm starting from Battalions of Fear and going through all the albums i don't have/haven't heard yet. I wasn't sure on Battalions of Fear after my first listen because it's quite different from the BG sound i was used to but, after a few more listens i definitely do like it.\u000a\u000aAnd then Threshold, well, i think i listened to one of the songs on that album somewhere along this week so that'll be why it's up there. I don't think it's a fantastic album by any means but i do still enjoy it to some extent.

p5920
aVMy last.fm has been nonexistent since I switched to Google Music years ago.\u000a\u000aI have been listening to Ascendia - The Lion and the Jester. It's one of the best symphonic metal discs I've heard in years. Those of you who like Kamelot/Serenity/Symphony X need to go hear this disc.\u000a\u000aI've also been revisiting the Bruce Dickinson solo albums and the golden era of prog metal aka 93-98. Some stars from that era would be:\u000a\u000aEmpty Tremor - Apocolokyntosis\u000a\u000aMayadome - Near Life Syndrome\u000a\u000aMaraya - No Hope For Humanity...?\u000a\u000a

p5925
aVI don't use last.fm or whatever makes those collages, but here is what i've been listening to the last week or so. \u000a\u000a**Power Metal**\u000a\u000a\u000a[Noble Beast- S/T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPn2e5zG1Lk): My album of the year from last year and I don't see this not getting regular spins anytime soon.  Its just too good. \u000a\u000a[Visigoth- The Revenant King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvMGT4wZ1N0): Not quite Noble Beast's self titled, but this is damn close.  This is my early contender for album of the year.\u000a\u000a[Savatage- Gutter Ballet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQZYTnxzeRk): A timeless album that should be owned by everyone. \u000a\u000a**Non-Power Metal**\u000a\u000a[Black Crown Initiate- Song of the Crippled Bull EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZpm3-68xZo)- This has been on steady rotation for the last year and a half.  These guys should be on everyone's radar because they are fucking amazing. \u000a\u000a[Ensiferum- One Man Army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl0ptqc2Jss)- The overall album is pretty hit or miss, but Axe of Judgement is pure energy and I hope they play it live, because its going to be so much fun. \u000a\u000a[Lich King- Born of the Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb0D0-aMhpY)- Seeing these guys later this week, can't wait.   They get better with each album. \u000a\u000a[Aborted- The Necrotic Manifesto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFIDFsfa3F4)- They bring the brutality. 
p5926
aVSavatage deserves a lot more love around here. I guess it's just because USPM in general is not that popular in this sub
p5927
aVDunno, the fapping to noble beast is pretty high, and they're US
p5928
aVUSPM isn't just about being from the US, its a style in of itself. Think more like old school Savatage, Jag Panzer, or Helstar. 
p5929
aVI know that, I still class Noble Beast along those lines.
p5930
aVYeah the general riffing and aggression definitely is, though the vocals tend more to the European side of things. In any case their debut is excellent.
p5931
aVWe did have Savatagurday for a while, not sure what happened there. We could always do it again...
p5932
aVSavatage put out a new album???? Oh, it's Gutter Ballet. Still amazing an album, I gravitate towards Hall of the Mountain King more.
p5933
aVEnjoy the Lich King show! I'm a longtime fan of theirs and only finally got to see them in 2013 (I think that's when it was) and it was both hilarious and brutal.
p5934
aVI can't wait, I really hope they play predator.
p5935
aVEnsiferum's new album is sweet. I just love when they're singing about decapitating, killing, pounding, smashing, slashing and also suffering, hate, revenge and other poetic stuff. That's how I like my folk metal.
p5936
asVLords of the Trident - Knights of Dragon's Deep
p5937
(lp5938
VMaybe, just to grant them a little bit more attention they deserve, we should talk about this album on our Official Album Discussion?
p5939
aVI second this!
p5940
aVVetoed
p5941
aVOVERRULED BY THE SINGER!! \u000a:-P
p5942
aVWhat gives?
p5943
aVI'm sure a discussion will be set up if people want it. I'm not against an official discussion, I just thought it'd be funny to say vetoed. I've been leaving stickied posts to Edledhron though.
p5944
aVThat IS funny.\u000a\u000aYou had me worried for another Gloryhammer-like argument! :P
p5945
aVI may be mod but I still gotta rustle some jimmies now and then. 
p5946
aVI was actually planning this, so it's nice to know that people are interested!
p5947
aVLove this album. My fav from 2015 so far. We should have a discussion. 
p5948
aVPretty damn good. Not my favorite melody ever, but more than passable, and I really enjoyed the lyrics. 
p5949
aVThis is really catchy and fun. I'll be sure to check out more from these guys.
p5950
aVthis is pretty good, definitely gonna give the album a listen
p5951
aVI really like this album. You can tell the guys are having *fun* doing what they do, which can be an incredibly refreshing break from all the overly serious productions. The whole album is solid, fun heavy/power.
p5952
aVI was highly impressed when they came through the New Metal Releases thread. Will be picking this up shortly.
p5953
aVI love the album cover.  It looks like inspiration came from Lovecraft's classic At the Mountains of Madness.
p5954
aVThanks guys, appreciate the support! If you guys have any questions about the album, the production, the band, etc. please let me know and I'll do my best to answer them.\u000a\u000aTo touch on a few points brought up thus far:\u000a\u000a**Dream Evil** - yes, we LOVE that band. A lot of the initial discussion about "what do we want to sound like" when the band started revolved around Dragonslayer &amp; Book of Heavy Metal\u000a\u000a**Tempos/Ballads** - We've always been a mid-tempo band (as far as metal is concerned) and I don't really see that changing much. Sure, we've got the occasional faster song (i.e. *Kill to Die* on this album), but that's just not us. We're probably never going to be overly thrashy, overly fast.\u000a\u000aIn terms of the "ballads"...when I'm writing vocal lines, I always try to make the choruses catchy enough to sing along on their own, or add in a bit of a "singalong" part. It's similar to what Hammerfall said in Metal: A Headbanger's Journey (at least I think that's the right documentary). There's a focus on the "drinking hall singalong" motif during the choruses that makes the live shows fun, and gives the audience a chance to participate. There's something very powerful about tons of voices singing a very simple part, and I love hearing it. 
p5955
aVI have a question for you...\u000a\u000aI can't for the life of me pick a favorite between "Knights of Dragon's Deep" and "Winds of the Storm"....HELP ME
p5956
aVHahaha. They're both good songs. Personally, I like Knights better, but that might just be because it's easier for me to sing. Winds is like a friggin' weightlifting marathon while being chased by rabid cheetahs.
p5957
aVAfter 10+ listens I have come to a conclusion: Winds of the Storm.\u000a\u000aWhen you put it like a weightlifting marathon while being chased by rabid cheetahs, the choice is obvious! Gotta appreciate that!
p5958
aVKinda reminds me of Dream Evil's Dragonslayer album.
p5959
aVLive show is ridiculously entertaining!  Madison 2/13 was CD release party.  I'll see it again and again....
p5960
aVthe main shortcoming of this album to me is way too many ballads\u000a\u000athe faster songs are pretty good USPM, but the slower stuff just kills it and turns it into a pretty mediocre album
p5961
aVMmmm I like 
p5962
aVWhy are people going nuts over this? Half-assed USPM\u000a\u000aReading through the comments, I'm seeing the age old indicator for an overrated album popping up.  "its fun"
p5963
aVIt's not groundbreaking, but I think it's well done. Nice riffs, I love the vocals with a few exceptions, and it's catchy. It is fun too, but there's more to it than that.
p5964
aVIt's not quite top tier but it's really solid and definitely above average. The fact that this is being made now and in the US is pretty sweet.
p5965
aV&gt; I'm seeing the age old indicator for an overrated album popping up. "its fun"\u000a\u000aHow dare people make music that makes others feel happy! Power metal is meant to be sombre and morose, not energetic and fun.
p5966
aVFeel free to put words in my mouth. That's fine. 
p5967
aVBeyond the Red Mirror is a bad album? How dare you say that?!
p5968
aVI'm not going nuts.\u000a\u000aIt's ok. Not something I'll listen to every day. \u000a\u000aIt's to meh and not enough story in it for me to listen to it constantly.\u000a\u000aBut all in all, it's ok.
p5969
aVSome people say it's fun, I say it's predictable.
p5970
asVSkywings - Gloria (New release, Japan)
p5971
(lp5972
VThe English lyrics make absolutely no sense, but I don't care!
p5973
aVSkywings being Skywing, which really just means solid Japanese styled power metal.\u000a\u000a"New" vocalist is doing a fine job. It's just weird that he found it more important to hold a mic, rather than his guitar, so the band looks like a guitarless power metal band for most of that video.
p5974
aVI don't know if you've seen the video for "[I Fascinate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWZ97ZXrTxM)", but he actually alternates between holding a mic and holding a guitar in that video. It's kind of funny, actually.
p5975
aVhe does the same thing here. it's a mindfuck to watch, especially with the rapid cuts being used. good song though, i didn't care for his vocals at first (compared to their original singer) back when fascinate released, but his style has grown on me. 
p5976
aVThe music is really great, the vocals aren't really traditional power metal but it fits the music.

asVWhat's your favorite unknown power metal band, one nobody has heard of?
p5982
(lp5983
VI'm going to take "unknown" as less than 2,000 listeners on last.fm.\u000a\u000aI've posted about this band quite a few times here and have told everyone I know about them, yet they still only have 1,784 listeners on last.fm. I know they have more fans than that and they're doing relatively okay in Brazil, so this surprises me.\u000a\u000aThis was one of my top albums of 2013. Best female vocalist in metal, in my opinion:\u000a\u000a* [Vandroya - The Last Free Land](http://youtu.be/aZT2m-KtWF0)\u000a\u000a* [Vandroya - Why Should We Say Goodbye? (Music Video)](http://youtu.be/W9pXKIYhTCM)\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso, this was one of the best live shows in 2014. Their vocalist is Urban breed (ex-Tad Morose, Bloodbound). They are phenomenal. Only 998 listeners on last.fm.\u000a\u000a* [Trail of Murder - Carnivore](http://youtu.be/pDoeKx9_ETo)\u000a* [Trail of Murder - I Know Shadows](http://youtu.be/mMEKnrCj5jo)\u000a\u000a

p5986
aVSeven Kingdoms is a local power metal band from Orlando that just hit 10000 Facebook fans. Their guitarist Camden is pretty much the reason Orlando has a metal scene. Their music video is called "After the Fall" on YouTube. (Can't post it from mobile, sadly.)
p5987
aVWait, they're not well known? I heard them on ERR and assumed they were famous.
p5988
aVI guess they're more famous than others, I just always knew them as a local band. 
p5989
aVThe Fire is Mine is a fantastic album.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gc9jG31YIQ

aV&gt; Seven Kingdoms\u000a\u000aI had a ticket for their only UK show to date, but then had to make an emergency trip to go and rescue my stranded girlfriend that night so I missed it. I've seen Sabrina performing at MFVF a couple of times, but not the band as a whole :-(
p5992
aVJudging from the 241 followers they have on spotify, Dragon Guardian isn't very well known.
p5993
aVIt is in the Japanese scene.
p5994
aVI'm gonna go with From the Dark. Only have one album so far (entitled The Opera Ghost), but it's a doozy - very dark and moody, but with plenty of badass riffs. Imagine if Kamelot ditched the symphonic elements and listened to a fuckload of Mercyful Fate and Portrait, and you've got the idea.\u000a\u000aThe album is [available for free](https://soundcloud.com/from-the-dark) on Soundcloud, and apparently they're working on new stuff now.\u000a\u000a* [Last Laugh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVSakcLIcAw)\u000a* [High Above](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIfVQdRE3uY)

aVAs an Iranian, I can't stand Angband. For the longest time I was really disappointed that the only major power metal band from Iran was bland, poorly produced, and incredible generic.\u000a\u000aThen [Whispers in Crimson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-NZlzPdlVY) put out an album this year with the singer from Sinbreed. I can finally reclaim my Persian Power Pride^^^Registered
p6011
aVI think i got two that my might be fairly unknown to most.\u000a\u000a[Powermad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irBTuU4WzVo), a band that play a mix of power and thrash metal, they only released an album in 1989and i think that album is the absolute bomb, it's a glorious mix of power and thrash and it just fucking works, catchy, riffy, and the bass is actually there which is rare for "moderner" power metal.\u000a\u000a[Wicked Maraya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMkQDH_S_FY), the heaviest power metal i have ever heard and sadly not a direction taken by the power metal community, as you all must have noticed the traditional power metal band sings in a happier tune with symphonies and fantasy lyrics which is not a bad thing, but i would love to see how power metal would sound if it took a heavier approach, in a sense, a more metal approach. Also, you can't deny the riffs on this album, another lacking aspect in power metal, this album has some of the most consistent riffing i have ever heard in a power metal album.
p6012
aVReally liking that Wicked Maraya
p6013
aVI figured you would, sadly both the albums are one hit wonders. Wicked Maraya would later evolve into just Maraya but they played a more progressive sound that wasn't as good as the album on the Wicked Maraya name.
p6014
aVZonata are absolutley fucking amazing. ~10k listeners on last.fm, is that too many?

aVI'm pretty sure I'm the only one around who listens to [Logar's Diary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQRx8RlDTOM).\u000a\u000aOther power metal bands I often listen to (that seemingly no one else does) are [Rimortis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08bPLN6npqo), [Soulblaze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyByUoCbrDI), [Acropolis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpQfjyxb_98), [403 Forbiddena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e37Ri_5xY5U&amp;index=14&amp;list=PL35663D981672B34D).

aV[Soul Stealer](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2gs206/soul_stealer_born_in_hell_lithuanian_heavypower/). A Lithuanian band not very well known outside of the country and even here it is not well known. They've got a very talented singer with amazing vocals.

aV[Hollow Haze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sso4DBnBCvs) is a band few seem to take notice of, despite the fact that they had non other than Fabio Lione doing the vocals for their latest album.

aVWhat band could possibly beat this album in /r/powermetal album of the year award?

aVCain's Offering has a new album coming out, and some people absolutely worship the debut album (myself included). Kamelot and Symphony X could also contend for the spot. Really it's anyone's game right now. Who would've thought a band like Noble Beast would have been so highly regarded this time last year? 
p6032
aVTheocracy could be a legit contender. I think I heard something about a new album this year.

aVThe whole album leaked apparently.

aVThe Ninth Wave is EASILY one of the best songs Blind Guardian has ever released.\u000a\u000aand they're my favorite band.\u000a\u000aEdit: I think I like Prophecies even more..ungodly good.\u000a\u000aEdit2: Listened through... This album is something special.
p6042
aVI actually thought The Ninth Wave was the weakest song on the album. 
p6043
aVNo way, I think that would be Twilight of the Gods.
p6044
aVNot even close, the fuck?  Are you serious?  I just cannot figure you out.  If you do not at least agree the intro to the song is astounding, then I will have lost much faith in you.
p6045
aVIts boring.
p6046
aVSeriously?  Even my friend who does not care for Blind Guardian thought it was great.  Nothing has hit me in the way it did for awhile.  I really appreciate that kind of style, though.  So epic.
p6047
aVIndeed it did. The standard edition, anyways.
p6048

p6051
aVThe entire album leaked to torrent sites. 
p6052
aV*Must... resist...!*
p6053
aVI don't see a great reason to resist, I will tell you though that it is possibly better than Nightfall, I've listened through twice so far and its just ludicrously good.
p6054
aVMy reasons are:\u000a\u000a* Sound quality - chances are CDs will be of a higher quality than what's available.\u000a\u000a* I splurged on the earbook and want my first playthrough to be the full experience, bonus tracks included.\u000a\u000a* Plus there's just something special about getting the album in the mail and having most of the songs to look forward to! 
p6055
aVI understand the second two reasons, but the leak is pretty high quality. Not trying to tempt you or anything...
p6056
aVi heard the single and i wasn't all that impressed tbh, it sounded a bit too 'night at the opera'... which I did enjoy but thought was... too operatic I guess.\u000a\u000abetter than nightfall though... that's a big statement.
p6057
aVI think Twilight of the Gods, while a good song is probably the low point of the album.\u000a\u000aI personally love the opera stuff they do though.
p6058

p6062
aVThat better be a lot of good stuff to say!
p6063
aVthank you kind stranger\u000a
p6064
aVThis is amazing!
p6065
aVSo there's a 320 kbps leak out there, and I decided to check it out. The music is a lot better than I expected, and I'm not a BG fan, but the production is atrocious. My friend wasn't wrong with his analysis; it's almost unlistenable. The production is so bad. Please don't tell me I'm the only one who hears this.\u000a\u000aAnd I don't think it's just due to the leak's source. 320 kbps is more than close enough to CD quality for it to not be an issue.
p6066
aVThe drums are barely there, but other than that i'm not seeing a huge issue. 
p6067
aVThe production seems pretty good to me, much clearer than A Twist in the Myth and A Night at the Opera at least.\u000a\u000aedit: in headphones, its a lot messier sounding without them, but that's Blind Guardian for you.
p6068
aVIt's just a wall of sound, a brickwall. It's a very good wall of sound, albeit, but there's no dynamic range. There's no "layering". for a lack of a better term, between the instruments, the orchestration, and the vocals. Everything's just piled on top of each other. \u000a\u000aI'm using Pioneer HDJ headphones to listen to this right now, and those headphones pick up everything. It's such a shame too.
p6069
aVI know what you mean, to me I expected better layering like "At the Edge of Time" Hansi's vocals don't really shine in this new album...
p6070
aVDynamic range, especially in metal, is more of a rare gift than the norm, unfortunately. From the samples I've heard, I can see the layering issue, and there are some times when its become a bit too messy, but overall I can't say I see it as a huge deal. Certainly not at an 'almost unlistenable' level. Also on some higher end headphones.
p6071
aVI know exactly what you are talking about.  It is really disappointing me but at least it's not terrible.
p6072
aVThe production has received a lot of criticism. Though if Twilight of the Gods gives a good taste of it, the only thing that bothers me is the drums, and even then not much. However, I do tend to be more lenient than most when it comes to production.
p6073
aVIt's missing not just drums, but to me it seems like they forgot about the low end. I'm not a bass lover, but it sounds like the leak is missing the lows almost all around. I thought it might have been the leak....but then I listened to the Youtube version, exact same thing....\u000a\u000aEDIT: I take back my statement about the lows....it's the vocals that are just muddled randomly. They don't sound like a separate track like they should, it sounds like whoever did the mixing just put vocals in with the guitar and popped it in. To me what makes BG so great is the vocals and they just aren't shining in this album like they should be....At the Edge of Time was a perfect example of where I thought this album would start with a jumping off point....and while good, it's let me down a bit.
p6074
aVIt's late, and I'm too tired to give this album a proper listening, but my first impression is that, while it is good, it seems to be missing something crucial.  Layering maybe? Dynamic range? I was a big fan of their last three albums and the direction the band was heading in, but maybe this album just doesn't have the spirit of the others.\u000a\u000aI'll try again tomorrow. :P

aVPathfinder -  Beyond the Space, Beyond the Time\u000a\u000aI just always get an epic feeling and go a bit mental when it comes on. The guitar work in general but especially the guitar v keyboard duel right at the end really, really do it for me. Like, super do it.
p6128
aVYeah I love that song. Pathfinder are another of my favourite bands, though I don't have many.
p6129
aVAnother one of these, eh. Fairyland - Score to a New Beginning.
p6130
aVThanks, and I'm new to this subreddit :P
p6131
aVWasn't complaining :P Welcome to the magical land of /r/PowerMetal.
p6132
aVThanks, it seems like a good place for new music. Though not specifically a power metal fan, I'm into a subgenre; symphonic power metal. \u000a\u000aOrchestras and stuff combined with power metal, love it.
p6133
aVOh, all right. Well, Score to a New Beginning is pretty much the ultimate symphonic power metal track. You could also try Avantasia - The Wicked Symphony
p6134
aVI'll give those a go, thanks again :) 
p6135
aVListen to the Scarecrow as well.
p6136
aVWill do.
p6137
aVIt's always a joy to have ones that are seeking enlightenment visit
p6138
aVDefinitely the whole album and not just the song, despite the song being a masterpiece by itself. Score to a New Beginning is at the end of a massive buildup of other songs
p6139
aVAnything off the transcendence album by crimson glory. That album is just prog-power metal goodness 
p6140
aVI'll look into it, thanks.
p6141
aVAll time has gotta include [Mindtraveller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yMsxQWuWvE), [The Clarion Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iswq0SWBRFA) and [Perjury and Sanctity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERc-_8rzF1o)\u000a\u000aThey're really hard to explain, of course, but I think Mindtraveller has an unrivaled feeling of adventure, the Clarion Call is just a pretty epic song in its scope and Perjury and Sanctity has got a really sweet chorus.\u000a\u000aIt changes of course, but right now I'm feeling [Kiuas - Warrior Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hQRpu_cYEg) as well (warning: it's a bit heavier than most power metal. the two growls at the beginning are it for harsh vocals though)\u000a\u000aI love this song because it really has the sort of warrior-of-nature pagan/druidic feeling to it. However, it's also pretty heavy and the lyrics and vocals and instrumentation all feel top notch. I'm not assuming you'll like it, but I'd be remiss if I didn't include it.
p6142
aVThanks for all of those. It's great to hear what other people love to listen to.
p6143
aV[Galneryus - Point of No Return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRPlkCug0D4)\u000a\u000aFrom the keys in the intro to the great chorus and then to the amazing guitar and keyboard solos; this song has everything that I'd want in a power metal song.

asVState of /r/PowerMetal - Trolls and PelleK Bashing
p6145
(lp6146
VAs a lurker can we just stop with this silly business and share some good music thank you
p6147
aVFirst off, thank you for pointing out the elephant in the room. It's something that I've been wanting to discuss as well, and that's the PelleK bashing.\u000a\u000aI get that a majority of this subreddit is not a fan, but to see it posted constantly is not needed. New stuff? Don't see a problem, (promoting new material is a good thing) but to continue shoving it down the subreddit's throat? That gets annoying fast. (I recall saying the same thing a few months back when GloryHammer was getting posted all the time) I prefer some variety with what's posted instead of the same few bands posted all the time.\u000a\u000aI would be hesitant to say PelleK should be blacklisted because of this, but it has already been discussed before that the subreddit isn't large enough to warrant such an action (be it PelleK or any other band).\u000a\u000aAnd I will agree on the last point as well;\u000a\u000a&gt; Bring back healthy discussion instead of this toxicity.
p6148
aVI can somewhat agree with this...all the complaining from both sides is accomplishing is a shitty atmosphere.
p6149
aV&gt; I have no plans to leave, no big dramatic post that I'll regret later because I'll come back anyways\u000a\u000aFor the record, I did say I was gonna come back at the end of the year to see all the lists and catch up on anything I missed in 2014. No regrets, and I don't see myself sticking around much longer once 2015 begins, especially if this sub remains the way it is.\u000a\u000aI wanted to make a post like this earlier, but I didn't know what to say. I completely agree with everything you asserted, though. 
p6150
aVIt was a friendly attempt to poke fun - do not take it personally.  Many of us are glad you came back, me included.
p6151
aVDon't worry about that. I saw the heart &lt;3
p6152
aV[awww](https://i.imgur.com/hUNAo.jpg)
p6153
aVAs long as we don't have a day dedicated to posting PelleK stuff (I mean we see it so damn much already) I'm fine with people posting him\u000a\u000aProbably won't listen to it, but that's my choice\u000a\u000aAlso it's logical to be annoyed by something you have seen a lot that you aren't a huge fan of, which is where I think the annoyance is coming from. It's also annoying to see people complaining about the guy if you like him, but I'm just saying it is likely that both parties are annoyed.
p6154
aVI agree. For example, I'm not a huge fan of the Japanese Power Metal signing so I usually just skip it. That being said, the postings of Japanese metal bands is not out of control so I have no problem with it.
p6155
aVWell, i agree with everything but I'm curious about one thing.\u000a\u000a&gt;firstly, he is a better singer than almost everyone here.\u000a\u000aWhat does this have to do with anything? Not trying to raise a discussion, just seems that you're saying that if he sings better than us, he can't be criticized.
p6156
aVFair enough, I will elaborate.\u000a\u000aOf course he can be criticized; if he is better than us, it does not save him from our opinions.  But the majority of the opinions on him are "he sucks dick", "he's a shitty singer", "I stopped at 5 seconds in", and "he needs to stop making videos".  There is nothing constructive about it and the intent is to just be an ass.  If you want to be constructively critical, that is cool.  If you want to be a dick, then stop.  \u000a\u000aAlso, saying he is a "bad singer" shows you are just trying to be an ass.  He's not a bad singer.  There is a difference between him being a bad singer and him being a vocalist you do not like.
p6157
aVI understand where you are coming from but imo, saying that he is not a bad singer is also incorrect. I actually think that he is a bad singer and a really bad one because he overuses is voice in nearly every song, sometimes sings off key and occasionally uses weird voices that not only ruins the song, it also becomes laughable.\u000a\u000aI agree that he has a great voice but that doesn't make him a good or bad singer, there is a lot to singing and it doesn't depend only on the voice.
p6158
aVThe only thing you pointed out there that would be reason to being a bad vocalist was "sings off key", and I have never heard him do that.  I think you are grasping at straws there, because if he is great at one thing, it is hitting the notes.  The other two points you made go back to "being a vocalist you do not like".
p6159
aVI like PelleK but if you're gonna literally cover the entire subreddit with him you've got to expect a bit of blowback.
p6160
aVThis was before the subreddit was being filled with him.  And during.  But before, as well.
p6161
aVI would say that this is a reasonable position.
p6162
aVAll I've gotta say is if you can't handle an artist you dislike existing, please GTFO
p6163
aVExcellent points raised, but entirely pointless unless something tangible is done. In other words, this sub needs a moderator (one who is present on a daily basis).\u000a\u000aI haven't been here long enough to have much of an opinion on the matter. The only thing I dislike here is the sidebar elitism. It's hard to tell whether this is a place to discuss opinions on both well-known and obscure power metal bands, or if it's just a place for circlejerk worship of a limited number of bands representing a limited spectrum of power metal, defined by a limited set of quality criteria. But perhaps this is another topic altogether. Just wanted to put it out there.
p6164
aVI haven't been here long enough to really know as well, but from what I am to understand the "sidebar elitism" is mostly a way to introduce those who want to get into PM without posting a "I'm New, What Do I Listen To?" thread.\u000a\u000aI also see it as albums that those who do frequent PM tend to agree are recommended listening material. I don't agree with all of it, but a majority of it is worthwhile for sure.\u000a\u000aBut perhaps this is a different topic that can get discussed. I'd be interested to know if it gets a vote of change or stays how it is.
p6165
aVI don't have a problem with the sidebar itself. As you point out, it avoids the newcomer syndrome. It does need to be maintained, though. There are plenty of bands that deserve a spot. For example, /u/REkTeR just posted a review of Heavenly, which should be on there.\u000a\u000aThe problem, as I see it, is that you run the risk of getting antagonized for not agreeing with everything that's on the list. If your opinion deviates from the one provided by the list, you're likely to be met with condescension or even insults.
p6166
aVThat is a shame to be basically insulted with a disagreement of the albums there. I mean, what if someone preferred Starfall to Under the Grey Banner? Even with a solid argument, expect some sort of backlash.\u000a\u000aAnd I agree, not seeing it updated is unfortunate, especially with the example you pointed out. It should be something that is taken care of more often than not.\u000a\u000aFor myself, I've even been tempted to put something up there that we don't have, but it'll get swept away from more links getting posted before long.\u000a\u000a
p6167
aVAs things stand now, REkTeR's new review will be lost forever in the sea of posts. The same goes for all of my posts. I'd only need to make an index and have that index added to the sidebar, but whether or not my strongly opinionated reviews deserve to be there is yet another topic.
p6168
aVIn reference to the material you have writtten, I think it would be a lot like the guides that are there already. You can agree and disagree however you wish, but it's the perspective of someone who appreciates the band(s) as much as they do.
p6169
aVMoreover...epic rock radio adds new stuff maybe once in a couple months these days, and the site interface is like 1995 style.\u000a\u000aOh and guess what the first addition in 2 months was!!!\u000a\u000a(not even gonna say it)
p6170
aVGood post 10/10
p6171
aVIMHO:\u000a\u000a**On the one hand** - UnlostHorizon and mushman tend to think they run the show and everyone just sort of rolls with it despite having a history of trolling/being generally antagonistic. BUT they add some good content so whatever.\u000a\u000a**On the other hand** - it's all just light-hearted fun, if you don't like it downsword and move on (or just ignore it). The community is self-policing people only upvote what they want to see more of. We discussed whether this was a good/bad thing when we talked blacklists. 
p6172
aVI can't tell what some people expect this sub to be. This is a quite low traffic, low userbase sub, but if anyone thinks one guy trolling is a big time problem, they haven't been around very long.\u000a\u000aSo there was a day when everyone posted PelleK videos, maybe even a couple days. Did other content stop flowing into the sub? Did NO ONE get a kick out of seeing that stuff everywhere; did it not put a smile on your face? Was like a Christmas blessing of /r/circlejerk with a power metal twist. Were there people who didn't smile and keep scrolling?\u000a\u000aIs this supposed an incredibly serious sub? Can we really vilify spontaneity because some people felt a bit miffed? \u000a\u000a
p6173
aV&gt; UnlostHorizon and mushman tend to think they run the show and everyone just sort of rolls with it despite having a history of trolling/being generally antagonistic\u000a\u000aCould you elaborate? I don't ever troll knowingly. That whole "PelleK Tuesday" was literally my hope to purge the PelleK posts and get people to stop posting his videos ironically. And aside from that, I don't recall having done anything close to "trolling". And when am I antagonistic? This is all a huge surprise to me.
p6174
aVIt was more mush = fairly trolly and then both of you kinda antagonistic. To be fair I think lately you've been better but I noted *several* previous instances of you sparking off of people, starting arguments, being rude and generally not representing the community well.\u000a\u000aFeel free to disagree if you like, it's just what I've honestly picked up on and it genuinely surprises me that it's surprising to you. \u000a\u000aNo grudges though I really like the state of the sub at the moment and I think both you and him have submitted some really quality stuff.  
p6175
aVI don't think /u/UnlostHorizon has ever been antagonistic...
p6176
aVBear in mind he used to be /u/imcominforyou before he had to delete that and clean up his act. But hand-on-heart he has previously.
p6177
aVI didn't delete /u/imcominforyou for that reason. I posted some stuff onto /r/depression with that old account that I didn't want being traced back to me (some friends of mine know my reddit username). It had nothing to do with /r/powermetal, and I wouldn't have told you guys who I was when I came back if it did.
p6178
aVI had a memory of it being because downvotes followed you around everywhere...if that's mistaken OK no worries...I know you left /r/powermetal for [other reasons](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2d18fb/why_im_leaving_rpowermetal_a_short_meta_novella/) and I stick by [my reply in that thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2d18fb/why_im_leaving_rpowermetal_a_short_meta_novella/cjm505x)
p6179
aVIt's obvious we're not getting anywhere with realkman666. Just report him.
p6180
aVIs it actually possible to ban someone from a subreddit? Not that i want to ban him but he is kind of immature.
p6181
aVIt's possible to ban an account. They can always come back with a new one, though.
p6182
aVrealkman667
p6183
aVYeah, it's possible. 
p6184
aVI guess if there are enough complaints, someone will have to do something about it.
p6185
aVYou beat me to the punch and were more articulate than I would have been.
p6186
aVIts now just become clear the state of this sub-reddit, i thought i was in the presence of people that i could discuss my opinion with, but that's obviously not the case, everything i have posted has induced some kind of bashing, just because my opinion differs from theirs.\u000a\u000aI don't understand why everyone is so hostile? We are not bashing your opinion, so why bash ours?\u000a
p6187
aVNow that the congregation has had time to ponder, do you all agree to stop with the hostility?
p6188
aVWhy is everyone ripping on one user? Unless he's threatening anyone he should be entitled to say whatever he pleases and you have the option to downvote it.
p6189
aVCommunities can regulate themselves if they please. This isn't a US-run governing body where the First Amendment applies. If someone is deemed to be too detrimental to the community, we can give them the boot if we please.
p6190
aVI don't know what the first amendment is nor do I care. I haven't seen any examples of him being a dick, probably because I haven't been looking, but if he is such a problem why not just give him the boot? Although people should probably keep negative opinions to themselves, they should be allowed to say what they like. Half the negative comments I see on here I tend to agree with. It's sad because only a few users have the audacity to make such posts.
p6191
aVOh, it's obvious you haven't been looking...\u000a\u000aStart with the last (and only) comment below threshold in this post.\u000a\u000aIf you catch realkman as 1 of the 3-4 replies in a newer post, the trend is him downvoting everyone else to 0; I'm talking rampant, blatant trend. He is an all-around black hole of self-righteous negativity.
p6192
aVYeah so what he's obviously being a smart arse because this post was made about him. I would do the exact same thing. It seems like you are the ones who created a troll by not letting someone say what they like. But anyway.\u000aCommence downvoting
p6193
aVIt isn't about negative comments - it's about comments which contribute essentially nothing to the discussion other than the growing annoyance of others - aka trolling.
p6194
aVPellek is pretty gay too in my opinion, not that I mind what gets posted on here
p6195
aV+1
p6196
aVYou could at least say something so we know you're not trolling again.
p6197
aVThis is essentially him continuing to troll.  This is my best bet.  Either that, or I hit the nail on the head with the PelleK bashing.  I honestly am not entirely sure, but if I had to guess, it would be the former.
p6198
aVZing.
p6199
aVThing is, he wants this reaction.  Just ignore him, if he's a troll.  Downsword and move on.
p6200
aVI don't think it's necessary at this point. Once you call someone a troll, there is no interest in communication. 
p6201
aVThere is clearly interest in communication.  There is little logic to that statement.  Maybe not everyone, but for some people.  UnlostHorizon clearly states that he would like to know whether or not your trolling is going to stop.  I made this post in the first place, including you in it.  It is obvious that I wish to know as well.  \u000a\u000aJust because most people would rather downvote every comment of yours does not mean there are no people that would like to see you stop the trolling train and go back to being a decent member.
p6202
aVI don't think you understand what I just said. I guess it's a bit "left-field".
p6203
aVI don't understand what you said either, then.
p6204
aVLet's just say that not worrying or obsessing over what others post would be a good start. 
p6205
aVThat's not how a subreddit works. Once you start trolling, you start being intrusive. We're both lucky and unlucky to have a mod who is so laid-back in regards to online etiquette, so us, the users of the sub, end up having to call you out whenever you do something stupid or post something asinine.\u000a\u000aPosting a different PelleK video every day for shits and giggles and setting out to undermine and mock other users is definitely something we can be "worried about". No one cares if I post a PelleK video because I don't do it repeatedly over a small timespan. But you do, and that's why we're "obsessed" with your posting habits, if I may indulge you.
p6206
aVI see that you persist, and I understand your limitations in comprehension.
p6207
aVThis post right here is exactly what Phyralis and I are troubled by.
p6208
aVWell, I don't think you should be troubled, but continuing to engage me once I've already told you that calling me a troll is not compatible with communication is an odd attitude indeed. 
p6209
aVI do not know if you feel the need to defend yourself due to being called out, but go ahead, I do not care.  I just want you to know it would be great if in future you go back to being a decent member, that is all.  The decision is yours to make, I just hope you make the right one.
p6210
aVHoping that a stranger agrees to please you and satisfy your desires because you make them know on an Internet forum is an early sign of emotional or mental instability.
p6211
aVWe are part of the community and what people post affects said community.  We have the right to be concerned.  Why do you think moderation exists in many subreddits?
p6212
aVTo decide what is acceptable or not.
p6213
aVThis acceptability includes but is not limited to how users in a subreddit act.
p6214
aVNow I know.

asVBlind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods (Official Lyric Video)
p6216
(lp6217
VThese gods certainly remain!\u000a\u000aThe youtube vid, at least for now, seems to be of a low quality. I'd recommend downloading the song from a digital retailer if you want a better taste of the album's production.
p6218
aVNow I am really getting worried.  Is this what the final is going to sound like?  What the hell is going on?
p6219
aVIt's just the video. Currently listening to 320 kbps bit rate ~14mb mpeg file from nuclear blast's download store, and it sound *much* better!
p6220
aVAye, I downloaded it, and I am much happier.  Overall, I will say that I prefer the At the Edge of Time production better, but people who are fans of the more raw production style (Imaginations from the Other Side, unsurprisingly) will be pretty happy with it.
p6221
aVIma is not raw, it's splattered garbage. 
p6222
aVYou sure have become quite the troll lately.
p6223
aVWould a troll tell you to fuck your face, wimp?
p6224
aVYes. Yes he would.
p6225
aVDid NB give you a digital download along with the purchase?  I ask because I received no such option...
p6226
aVNo, [got it here.](http://www.nuclearblast.de/en/products/download/download/blind-guardian-twilight-of-the-gods-single-.html)
p6227
aVGotcha - I'm hoping the vinyl will come with a digital download, didn't see any mention of it.
p6228
aVOne of the best $1 I've ever spent.
p6229
aVMissed it yesterday, so hearing it for the first time now. Loving it!!
p6230
aVHas the artwork from around 1:02 been shown in higher resolution? It looks awesome. One of my favorite things about BG is their imagery.
p6231
aVI wanted to know the same. That looks like it could be a really nice poster hanging on my wall.
p6232
aVYOU ARE A GOD!
p6233
aVThere was some really cool artwork in that video. I was a little skeptical when I heard the opening lyrics, Hansi sounded off in the first few screams, although I'm not sure if that was just due to the bad quality of the video as /u/Edledhron said. Pretty much everything after the first chorus I loved and am super hyped for the album.\u000a
p6234
aVI'm really liking this song, especially the solo, and am hyped for the album. The quality does seem off in the video but a normal version should fix that. 
p6235
aValright so I'm going to give my opinion, and most likely suffer for it. I think Hansi seriously needs to work on getting himself some sustain. If you're going to belting a lot like this you need some kind of vibrato. This is nothing against him stylistically, I think he does some really cool things. I just think he would sound about a thousand times cooler if he had solid sustain.
p6236
aVIt makes me sad how busy I've been that I  just now got time to listen to this.\u000a\u000aI will not keep Blind Guardian away from me for this long again!
p6237
aVI only just got time for this! And this is my favourite band. It's been a long 4 years, this is glorious.

VI really hope that Heavatar release more music, I loved this album
p6250
aVCouldn't stop playing this song when I first heard it! Guess I should give the rest of the album a go since I haven't fully listened to it yet. If the songs are anything like this, I'm sure that I'm going to enjoy them!
p6251
aVI'd recommend [Long Way Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7RJkiKAiR8), the choir vocals in it are among my favourite. [Elysium at Dawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp80Q2vJtxM), [All My Kingdoms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ue3xD9eItU) and [Replica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCdkXzT1F-w) are also quite great. [To the Metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2Z8cjlLCo) is a ballad that might feel a bit awkward at first because he sings at full volume with just a guitar behind him, but it's pretty catchy. \u000a\u000aFuck it, just listen to the whole album, it's a great example of power metal, and Stefan Schmidt's vocals are excellent if not a bit unusual
p6252
aVOh man, after a few listens I gotta say that this album is pretty damn great! Should have listened to it fully way earlier. Love his voice, the instrumentals, everything!\u000a\u000aedit: I gotta say, To The Metal is now my absolute favorite from the album! It's amazing how brilliant his voice is!
p6253
aVVery good listen, though I can't pretend to recognize the classical elements.  I'll add it to my wishlist!

(lp6260
VWent to their gig in London recently. Went with a Brazilian guy who was hoping for this to be played (because it's about the Brazilian Expeditionary Force) and a moment came where a random crowd member had to choose between this song being played next and Lion From the North. This got chosen and we lost our freakin minds :)
p6261
aVGoing to their concert in a month. Can't freakin' wait.
p6262
aVEvery time I see lyrics for this song, it has the line "Cobras Fumantes, viva esta su memoria" (Spanish for "Smoking Snakes, alive is their memory") at the end of the pre-chorus.\u000a\u000aBut it sounds so much like he's saying "Cobras Fumantes, eterna e sua vitoria" (Portuguese for "Smoking Snakes, eternal is their victory"). Which makes less sense, given that they eventually lost. Still, it's all I can hear when I listen to that line.
p6263
aVYes, the correct line is "Cobras Fumantes, eterna é sua vitória". From the video's comments, \u000a\u000a*The confusion with the phrases: "Eterna é sua Vitória" and the phrase that appears in the CD booklet, "Viva está sua Memória" is that originally, the phrase that came out in the booklet was the first choice, but the band changed the phrase sung to the music as it sounded better, and the company behind the booklet did not change at the end, so the phrase went wrong in the official letter.*
p6264
aVThey lost? Nope, they didn't. Brazil helped in the invasion of Italy, and the Allies succeded.\u000a\u000aMaybe you're talking about the specific skirmish between the Nazi and the Drei Brasilianischen Helden, so yes, in this case they lost.\u000a\u000aAnd yep, the line is "Cobra Fumantes, eterna é sua vitória"
p6265
aVYeah, I meant the 3 guys in the song lost. Cause, y'know, they died and stuff.

aVTrans Siberian Orchestra is my go-to Christmas music as well, even if it's not precisely power metal. It's tons of fun to listen to, and has the right spirit. "The Christmas Attic" is my favorite of the older albums.

aVFor sure, TSO's got everything how it should be.\u000a\u000aBut seriously. I've listened to that Theocracy song ([Wynter Fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jwHLsKsiCA)) like 10 times now, it sounds great and the lyrics are hilarious (looks like it's their own original christmas story, pretty great stuff!). If you are looking for christmas power metal specifically, this is probably the best set of covers for that goal.\u000a\u000aEDIT: The other ones are also pretty funny.

sVBeyond The Space Beyond The Time by Pathfinder, Can anyone tell me if these vocals are real?
p6299
(lp6300
VJust an FYI, this song has more than one male vocalist. Roberto Tiranti does the really impressive whistle register during the slow part of the song. 
p6301
aVso, in the beginning it's Pathfinders' vocalist? (first 30 seconds)
p6302
aVThe parts done by Pathfinder's singer are real, he can hit pretty high notes with his falsetto screams.  His head voice isn't bad either.  But the person singing during the slow part is Roberto Tiranti of Labyrinth fame.   He hits a B5 in his falsetto there.  \u000a\u000a
p6303
aVso in the first 30 seconds, where the vocals go really high it's pathfinders own vocalist and during the slow part it's Roberto Tiranti? or partly Roberto Tiranti, like, backing vocals?
p6304
aVYeah I'm pretty sure that's the vocalist of Pathfinder.  If you ever listen to  Fifth Element you can hear him showcase his range in a number of songs, the best one to hear is The Day I Turn Back Time where he hits B5 at the end.    If I recall in Beyond The Space, the only part where Roberto actually sings is in that one section..also another neat tidbit Bob Katsionis of Firewind plays the keyboards in the keyboard/guitar battle at the end of the song. 
p6305
aVforgive me but I don't really like firewind, I liked their songs but now that I know they can't play them live, I don't like the songs or the band anymore. Saw them live once and they were bad ... really bad. do you think I should give them another chance? I will check out fifth element with the song you recommended :D
p6306
aVI don't generally like them either, I like some songs because of the instrument playing but other than that meh.  However Bob is pretty good, he has some good solo stuff. \u000a\u000aAlso this is how they should have sounded live.   \u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGykrC-I21A&amp;list=PLmn0MCbZJXT1R308DCtljjPxYDCDjmsZx&amp;index=5
p6307
aVthis sounds pretty neat! I saw them at graspop, 2009 or 2011, could be even both. The vocalist couldn't hit his high notes and the drums were really basic. the guitars were really good but the sound didn't come through good enough, perhaps because it was open-air. well the total package didn't sound as I was expecting, especially when you know they're really good on album
p6308
aVYeah wasn't them as much as the sound production and singing isn't always easy for everyone lol especially at those kind of venues..everyone is drinking etc.   Well if they drink that is. 
p6309
aVI think so, i heard someone talking about how this guy uses a whistle technique or something? can't remember
p6310
aVwhistle notes is a real technique, that's correct :) thank you for your comment. check out adam lopez, he hit the highest notes ever by a male singer, it's in the whistle register :)
p6311
aVYeah, I hear a B5 at like :26-:27 in. Is that Tiranti or Kostro though? \u000a\u000aI've honestly never given Pathfinder much of a chance after hearing their one single all those years back; wasn't impressed.
p6312
aVThat's Kostro.  Someone told me that Roberto only sings in that one part. \u000a\u000aIt's more believable if you listen to some other Pathfinder stuff where Kostro is the only one singing, he can hit the B5s too. 
p6313
aVSeems like Roberto is doing most of the heavy lifting on this one
p6314
aVI have been able to hit every note in this song; the range is real, for sure.  However, how it sounds might have been given some help from the studio.  Between polish and echo, it helps the higher notes sound a lot more pure.  That said, maybe there are people that can sound like that - if I can hit those high notes with a struggle, I am sure there exist some people that can hit those high notes without said struggle.\u000a\u000a
p6315
aVthanks :) you must be pretty impressive if you can sing like this :D

aVBeen a busy weekend, thus why you get a review on Monday\u000a\u000a**Beyond Reason:** This is what we call "Tape Trading Quality". Not sure if that's on purpose or not. Otherwise, this is a solid song, although it feels like I've heard it somewhere before. *worth a listen, if you can get past the audio quality*\u000a\u000a**Uncertain Furtue:** I'm feeling the USPM style in the vein of Warning-Era Queensryche, right down to the vocals. Excellent stuff here for sure *Fans of USPM will get a kick out of this one*\u000a\u000a**Tanagra:** No Darmok and Jilad? Bad Star Trek reference aside, this looks awesome (album cover wise). It's a toe-tapper for sure, although I'm not a fan of the growling vocals, they seem out of place for me on this song. *mild interest to hear more material, saddened on there being no Star Trek puns*\u000a\u000a**Adreniline Mob:** A band I always describe as "If Russel Allen sang for Black Label Society". Really wasn't keen on this song. After hearing the Guitar Hero version, this version pales in comparison. Even Russell Allen feels just "there" on this one. *listen once, then forget about it*\u000a\u000a**Aldious:** The /u/unlosthorizon special I see. I'm never a huge fan of lyrics in a different language, but I couldn't get over how much I liked the stage presense they had. Also, the music is catchy and well played, even in a live setting. My only gripe is the last minute or so. All I thought of was Frozen, which made me groan. *highly recommended, even if you're not a fan of Japanese Power Metal*\u000a\u000a**Destiny:** Such a generic name, could you not add a Dragon, Hammer or Blood in there? Music wise, loving the instruments, hated the vocals. Liked the clean stuff, then it was garbled yelling and I was soured on this band. *looking forward to more material, but man, those vocals...* \u000a\u000a**Manilla Road:** I'm surprised they still made music. Granted, I'm not as educated on my Manilla Road history (I should fix that...). I was digging the gritty sound, but was not digging the fact it wasn't a full song. *You had my curiousity, now you have my attention*\u000a\u000a**Lappalainen:** With a name like that, knew it would be folk metal. Heard it, hated the vocals. Harsh and grating. Sounds generic for its genre. *Avoidable*\u000a\u000a**Born of Fire:** Visually, did not like the vocalist. Musically, these guys are solid. They could have cut down some of the song (like the slow keyboard part) and it would be much more enjoyable. Felt they could have used more power to their sound, but maybe that's just me. *worth a listen, perhaps multiple*\u000a\u000a**Megora:** At times I thought I was listening to old Godsmack, which isn't all a bad thing, but it feels generic for metal. *not recommended*\u000a\u000a**Lords of the Trident:** 45 seconds in and I'm headbanging away. That's a good song right there. I felt the solo was slightly lacking (at first) but picks up in a hurry. Even the lyrics are great, despite being drenched in fantasy. *Listen to this to start your day off right*\u000a\u000a**Grey Wolf:** It was over before it began. Kind of just there really. Although it ended suddenly which I found odd. Nothing wrong with this, just forgettable *skippable*\u000a\u000a**Winterage:** Sounds like Rhapsody of Fire? Must be from Italy. Quick look say yup, I am correct. So with that, it's standard Rhapsody of Fire fare in the vein of Frozen Tears of Angels/Power of the Dragonflame. *My recommendation for the week*
p6376
aVThere is a plethora of amazing black metal, i'll have you know!\u000a\u000a
p6377
aVI'm pretty sure [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsXlzf0NkAc) must be on the extremely crappy end. Accidentally listened to it because the band was classified as Black Metal (early), Power Metal (later), and they had a release last week. Little did I know it was a re-issue of an earlier black metal album. Guy sounds like he's puking and the song makes me want to kill myself. I get that people like unclean vocals, but I find it hard to believe that anyone listening to this think "this is pleasant to my ears". But what the hell do I know, 80% of the releases on the Metal Archives have unclean vocals so apparently that's what's popular nowadays.
p6378
aVYes that is at the extremely crappy end.\u000a\u000aFor a power metal aficionado, I would recommend 3rd wave stuff as a gateway. Stuff like [Keep of Kalessin - Ascendant](http://youtu.be/TTXfrFEI93U), [Saturnian - Shadow Of Prophecy](http://youtu.be/sQtjJjhzj0k), or heck even [Dimmu Borgir - Dimmu Borgir](http://youtu.be/2c7cG91RbIM) 
p6379
aVI've only listened to Dimmu Borgir so far but this is the first time I've enjoyed anything close to black metal. I'm gonna have to save your post so I can check out the rest later.
p6380
aVNever used to listen to black metal...you gave me faith in the genre.\u000a\u000aDimmu Borgir are fucking badasses, and the other two are great too, although Saturnian aren't really my style; vocals are a little too harsh.\u000a\u000aI really fucking liked DB though.

aVNow, at first I was expecting huge, skyscraper-high text in the recommendations section reading "Manilla Road". Then I listened to the preview and understood the lack of mention of them.\u000a\u000aDarmok approves of Tanagra. As it happens, I do as well. Nice recommendation! Will have to check them out when the album releases.\u000a\u000aAs to the Black Metal business I have to ask: Is it depicting you pressing a button causing your own demise due to despair or is the picture depicting the obliteration of your very being by the soul-crushing Black Metal booming out of your speakers?
p6383
aVThat would be the former. If there's one thing people know about me, it's that I can't stand unclean vocals. I don't usually make a big fuss about it, but that one particular song I listened to by accident (link in my reply to Mushmancat) was just so repugnant and disturbing that I almost lose sleep over it.
p6384
aVYeah this is pretty disturbing, I can't fault you for your response in the least. That's a minute of my life I won't be getting back ever again.

aVHad a shit week but here I am, [ready for some more metal](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/077/988/my_body_is_ready.png)!\u000a\u000a**Beyond Reason: A New Reflection** - Alright, so this is kind of amazing, I mean, the production is bad but this is some seriously good USPM. I guess I'll have to try and find more from these guys. Definitely worth a check.\u000a\u000a**Uncertain Future: Shock the System** - This immediately throws me back to the 80s style of power metal and definitely reminded me of Fifth Angel. I don't really like the song, maybe it's the vocals or maybe it's the weird ass production.\u000a\u000a**Tanagra: None of This is Real** - The album immediately caught my eye (the left one) because it's rare to see purple tones in power metal albums, it's usually used in the more depressive/angry realms of metal. The lyrics sort of reflect the style and makes me wonder if the rest of the album is as pessimistic as this song. The song itself is good but the intro is just bland and boring and it would be better if it just start right off with the riff, even worse the intro melody is reincorporated later in the song. Cool chorus.\u000a\u000a**Adrenaline Mob: Dearly Departed** - Cool cover song, don't have an opinion on this one. Just give it a shot.\u000a\u000a**Aldious: Live Tour 2014 "Dazed and Delight"\uff5eLive at Club Citta'\uff5e** - This wouldn't have been half as bad if anyone knew how to fucking sing. The bassist is one odd cookie.\u000a\u000a**Destiny: Time** - This song is very rich in instrumentation, there is always something going on and everything is filled and packed. However, the vocals are a bit too wild, he changes tone very quickly and I wonder if it's something I could get accustomed to. This one is worth your time and repeated listens.\u000a\u000a**Manilla Road: The Blessed Curse** - It's Manilla Road so you have to check out. Unrelated: Does anyone know if there will ever be another HellWell release? That was some awesome stuff.\u000a\u000a**Lappalainen: Kraken's Awakening** - Sounds Finnish right? They're french... Although a very odd folk song, this is very enjoyable and was very fun to listen too, the folk seems to be delivered by only a flute which I think is really awesome. If you're into some rough folk stuff, it might be for you.\u000a\u000a**Born of Fire: Dead Winter Sun** - Now get this... the vocalist name is... Gordon Tittsworth.... Back to the song, I am 100% positive there is a very good 3/near 4 minute song in this 6 minute song, the slower parts although are done well, they just seem to hold back the song and ends up becoming plod-ish.\u000a\u000a**Megora: Burning Empire** - Uninspired and boring.\u000a\u000a**Lords of the Trident: Frostburn** - Cool meat and potatoes song.\u000a\u000a**Grey Wolf: We are Metalheads** - What a bad album a name. The song pays homage to old school traditional heavy metal. Galloping riff style song. It stops very abruptly, weird...\u000a\u000aWhat *I* may have missed last week but really didn't\u000a\u000a**Winterage: The Harmonic Passage** - I heard this album a few times already and I definitely recommend to anyone interested in symphonic stuff. It's far from perfect but there are some very interesting songs, I personally recommend "Golden Worm".\u000a\u000aCool week, some very interesting songs, quietly waiting for the Nightwish release.\u000a\u000a[MFW I saw the new sub look](http://img.pandawhale.com/65402-dear-god-its-beautiful-mugatu-Zmxe.gif)\u000a

aVReggie is a beautiful, beautiful man.\u000a\u000aI'm looking forward to digging into Tanagra's release, but I'm prepared for a medium-to-kinda-good album. I feel like "Tyranny of Time" could have been a lot better if it had some better riffs. I'm more excited about the album art than the album itself, tbh. But who knows, we might be positively surprised.\u000a\u000aI was really weirded out by Lappalainen being French. Folk metal is pretty big in Finland, did they give their band a Finnish name to appeal to that crowd?
p6387
aVDestiny sounds interesting (but could they have gone with a more generic band and album name? Googling this is futile).\u000a\u000aAlso Roberto Tiranti is a guest vocalist! Definitely going to give this a listen.

aVI expect you found their [Bandcamp](https://destinycr.bandcamp.com/releases) page by now?

VAre you me? I just got this album yesterday, this is my favourite song off it.
p6405
aVI absolutely love this album. This album and band are to power metal as the Zucker Brothers and 'Airplane' is to the disaster movies.  Completely self aware (even down to the track order!),  serious about not taking themselves seriously, use every power metal trope in existence, and they make sure to back it up with spot on performances.\u000a\u000aWouldn't expect anything less from a Christopher Bowes inspired project :) 
p6406
aVWhat's this about the track order? I don't get it, you mean the story progression?
p6407
aVI've realized over the years that some of the best albums I've heard have certain kinds of tracks in certain spots on the albu and Tales from the Kingdom of Fife\u000a\u000a1) 30 sec-1 minute opener\u000a\u000a2) Killer song that feeds right off of said opener that may or may not pass for the lead single (like Lion From the North on Carolus Rex), check.\u000a\u000a3)Token ballad midway through\u000a\u000a4) Another killer song right after the ballad (like Warriors on Freedom Call's Eternity)\u000a\u000a5) Solid instrumental bit near the end (like Revontulet from Sonata Arctica's slience)\u000a\u000a6) Token 10+ minute epic to end the album\u000a\u000a\u000a
p6408
aVGloryhammer have the same problem as Dethklok. They put all the humour into the lyrics, while putting all their creative effort into the music, leaving people at a sort of standstill where they don't know if they're supposed to like it or not. Personally I think the music on the album is great, and the funny lyrics are enjoyable on another level. The thing about "not taking themselves seriously", is that people seem to assume that because you don't take yourself seriously, then you can't be serious about the music, but really the music is just as good as these other PM bands, it's the fact that they don't take themselves seriously that sets them apart. Are they any better than most power metal bands? Probably not, but the fact you can sing along with a smile on your face to these stupid lyrics is what people like about them.
p6409
aVIs it the unicorn bit that's throwing people off? The lyrics on the album doesn't seem that much out of the ordinary for this branch of power metal if you replace unicorn with dragon or similar.
p6410
aVSee, the thing is that most of the critics of Gloryhammer are primarily concerned on the *music*, which is terribly generic and rather dull in the eyes of many. It takes a lot for lyrics to turn me away from a song (it would have to make a successful attempt at being terribly offensive and serious about it) - they can certainly help a song, but a song can be fantastic with its lyrics being nothing more than gibberish. But when uninspired, inelegant, and derivative instrumentation is the best an album can do, I lose interest quickly. The vocals are good, though.
p6411
aVStop making valid points. Gloryhammer fanboys have decided that any and all criticism of the band must be because of the lyrics and that's final! It obviously has nothing to do with the lack of songwriting ability. 
p6412
aVI don't know how many times we have to say it. No one gives a shit about the lyrics, its the completely generic songwriting. Its the same problem with Alestorm, the dude doesn't know how to write compelling music. 
p6413
aVThat's not true, Alestorm's last album is considerably better than anything he put out and I actually think its a very good power metal album. The keyboards in the Gloryhammer album are actually not bad and the keyboard solos end up stealing the show. The guitar and bass are just horribly bland.
p6414
aVI don't see it. Im certain that without the pirate schtick Ale storm would be completely obscure. 
p6415
aVGonna be honest, whilst it didn't bring anything new to the table, I though this album was pretty tight.
p6416
aVI really love how power-metaly they are.  They don't take themselves seriously and I really enjoy that aspect about them.  They should change their name to Fondue because of how cheesy they are, but they *try* to be!

p6457
(lp6458
V&gt; Night Witches is a fucking blazer of an opener. Anyone who hears this song first is instantly sold on the album.\u000a\u000aFunny story about that song - when I saw them with Amon Amarth in October ([link to setlist](http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/sabaton/2014/upstate-concert-hall-clifton-park-ny-3ccf18f.html)), there was a guy in the audience wearing a WWII helmet - he would hold up a flag for the country that the song was referencing... and he did it for EVERY song.\u000a\u000aBy the end of the 3rd song, Joakim caught on to what he was doing - he pointed the guy out to the crowd, said "you got our setlist, didn't you" and the crowd started laughing (they're so fucking good interacting with the crowd).  Then, Joakim said "well, let's see what happens if we change that up a little" and started playing Night Witches (which wasn't on the other show setlists).  No other songs were about Russia, so when the dude held up a Russian Flag, the band members all just burst out laughing.  They also teased us later in the set by doing the intro and a little of the opening verse of Master of Puppets... then they stopped and I almost shed a tear (they could have pulled it off easily)...\u000a\u000aBest show I've ever been to (Amon Amarth was also incredible, as expected).  When they were done, they said they would definitely be back.  I also heard a bunch of people on the way out talking about how they hadn't heard of Sabaton before and how much they kicked ass - can't wait for them to come back around.  I had a stiff neck and a sore throat for two days after that show.
p6459
aVThey are crazy good live. I saw them in Glasgow and there was a guy who looked exactly like Joakim in the audience. Joakim said they would only play one (and only one) song from Coat of Arms, and they decided to let the lookalike choose between Screaming Eagles and Uprising. The guy chose White Death. They compiled. 
p6460
aVI went for all three bands (Skeletonwitch had van problems, so they had to cancel unfortunately), but Sabaton was who I was most excited to see and they just fucking killed it.  They also did the whole "bring a kid on stage and give him aviators" thing, and it was awesome - the kid had the biggest smile on his face afterward.\u000a\u000aAs the night was winding down, Amon Amarth was almost at the end of their allotted time and they're known to have the same two encore songs: Twilight of the Thunder God and Pursuit of Vikings (my two favorites, in backward order).  It seemed like they weren't going to have enough time at first, but they ignored the staff and did them anyway - I screamed both songs in their entirety, it was a perfect ending to an incredible night.\u000a\u000aThe funny thing about the show was that neither band had been to upstate NY before, and neither knew how they would be received - as it turns out, the crowd was fucking phenomenal and both bands knew it.  Thank God - at least we have the promise of some excellent shows down the road.

asVReinXeed--Farewell
p6543
(lp6544
VI forgot about this band, great album! Pretty cool concept too
p6545
aVIs it fair to call this a Sonata Arctica worship song? It's oddly reminiscent of "[Wrecking the Sphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxbe5MynRI0)". It's still a great way to end a great album.
p6546
aVHm... the style is very similar to early SA, which has a Stratovarius vibe. Still, I wouldn't doubt that SA had an influence\u000a\u000aIt's amusing. Tommy ReinXeed originally did soft rock until he heard Helloween and Stratovarius. Sonata Arctica did hard rock until they shifted, but Stratovarius influenced Tony Kakko's singing. I hear quite a bit of Timo Tolkki in this\u000a\u000aI also found out what this song refers to: the album was based on the Titanic, and this song is about the people that died in the sinking. I was like "holy shit" when I read the lyrics and found out what it was about
p6547
aVI think it's pretty fair to call ReinXeed a SA worship band.

(lp6552
VI thought if there was a single time I might be able to appreciate Pellek's voice it would actually be for this.....yea that was a mistake.
p6553
aVHe fucking nailed it!!!
p6554
aVI totally disagree. I know the song forwards and backwards, and, when he did hyenas, his attempts to hit the higher notes he went way too high, leading to my biggest gripe with his singing. He's overextending his voice past where he really should. Is it a passable cover? Yes, is it stellar? Not even close. I expected more based off what his style is, but totally forgot to factor in his desire to try to take everything up to 11.\u000a\u000aGranted my thought process is the vocals of the original song were well suited with the backing instrumentals he was using already, which is why I was honestly hoping for him to keep it slightly restrained, with a slight flair that he loves to put into everything.
p6555
aVI guess that if you already love the song, this is understandable. 
p6556
aVRight, not to downplay Pellek, I think he honestly has more potential than most people give him, but damnit I think he needs some proper voice lessons, so he can learn a good range that fits him. When he hits the upper ends of his range his voice can be like nails on a chalkboard. It seems like he really wants to broadcast his range without realizing that just because you have a wide range doesn't mean your range is as well developed as you think.\u000a\u000aHis cover of Don't Stop Believing was in my mind much better, but the lyrics and original song work so much better with his desire to always hit the highest notes. Part of me would be interested in hearing him attempt to cover a Crimson Glory song, the range that Midnight was able to pull off was something else.
p6557
aV&gt;  I think he needs some proper voice lessons\u000a\u000aI can't believe no Norge has offered. He could become great with proper coaching.
p6558
aVFrom what I can tell he doesn't have the biggest following overall in much of the metal communities, most of his following comes from younger kids who are listening to more pop, where his over strained high notes tend to really be able to work. I suspect he's not getting it because his "fans" like what he's doing, so people aren't paying much attention to him, hence why no offerings.\u000a\u000aI took another gander at his channel, he's constantly just pandering to requests and it seems to be most of his popular videos are Anime theme songs....that won't get him proper recognition to get adequate voice lessons. If he sticks the path to metal, rather than just "metal" covers he could theoretically get some actual recognition.
p6559
aVIndeed, the audience is very young. His worst covers usually get the most praise, but maybe it pays the bills and that's all that matters to him, at least for now. :p
p6560
aVAnd your last sentence really makes me wonder if you know him or are him. Especially since you always post his videos.... Damn this internet anonymity! 
p6561
aVlol
p6562
aVI'm usually one to defend Pellek, but this was an epic fail of epic proportions. I can usually overlook his well documented vocal issues, but they just stood out like a sore thumb to me.\u000a\u000aEven worse, the pacing for this song was much, much to frantic.  Had he slowed the pace down it could have been at least tolerable.
p6563
aVI don't know the original, so I'm just enjoying the energy and enthusiasm. :S
p6564
aVA lotta hate, i'm not a huge fan of Pellek, i think he has a very 'punchable' face. Buut, this was a good cover. \u000a8/10 would listen again
p6565
aV:)
p6566
aVIf there's anything I enjoy more than Gloryhammer hatred, it's Pellek hatred.\u000a\u000aBest be grabbing my popcorn.

aVHe's truly misunderstood. :S
p6568
asVFreedom Call - Hunting High And Low
p6569
(lp6570
VHunting hih and low, i think more about stratovarius then freedom call
p6571
aVIt's ever so close to the Stratovarius version, almost so close that I can't enjoy it fully because I hear the little similarities in vocal delivery, the chorus, the similar sort of backing tracks... \u000a\u000aI couldn't listen to the chorus fully because I kept expecting "I AM HUNTING HIGH AND LOW" instead of "I AM HUNTING HIGH..." 
p6572
aVEverytime I hear this song start up, I listen up to see if I hear the Stratovarius song of the same name. (it is there in the intro, but otherwise it's not there)
p6573
aVNot a huge fan of this song, but I love me some Freedom Call.
p6574
aVThis album had a lot of song titles, like this one, that made me expect covers. I was really hoping Circle of Life and Starlight would be the covers I expected.
p6575
aVInteresting take on the song. I think this one is a lot worse and the original is just way better.
p6576
aVIt isn't a cover, but a song with the same name.
p6577
aVI feel like a fucking retard.
p6578
aVI have no idea how you thought they were the same song. 
p6579
aVdidnt listen to the lyrics even a little
p6580
aVI would too, if I was that retarded.
p6581
aVIt's not just me...thinking of Stratovarius lal, originally I thought that it is a cover but oh well..\u000a\u000aStratovarius' "I AM HUUUUUNTING HIIIIIGH AND LOOOOOOW" &gt; Freedom Call's "Hunting Hiigh and Looow"

aVMe too, I've heard two Japanese power bands with female leads today and both are great.

aV[deleted]
p6592
aVNeeds viathyn. They're on soundcloud :P
p6593
aVIf I was going to include Soundcloud, this list would be gigantic. This is just for YouTube.
p6594
aVAlso, these guys would be nice:\u000a[Elderoth - Mystic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnY_cRkcnCw&amp;list=PLRXOdSSY3he7v1FgX87UXf4Xt4wafKoD7)
p6595
aVDid you not read my intro? "No playlists".
p6596
aVSorry, I was under the impression that listening to a playlist of songs lifted from a single disk would be listened to in the form of a playlist.
p6597
aVBut if that were the case, I'd pretty much have 95% of all the albums released this year on this list, and that's crazy. \u000a\u000aThe problem with YT's playlists is that if one track gets removed for copyright, the playlist remains, and then you're left with an incomplete album.
p6598
aVLuckily that one is uploaded by the band so that should not be the case :P
p6599
aVIf you want to make a list like this but include playlists in them, be my guest.
p6600
aVEh i'll probably write my end of year thing soon and get laughed off the subreddit, way too early in the morning for anything right now though.
p6601
aVDespite no Freedom Call, this is an excellent list of albums.
p6602
aVThe Xandria YT link you included isn't the whole album, it's just the song "Nightfall" on repeat for an hour.
p6603
aVFuck it, I'm keeping it. 
p6604
aVxD
p6605
aVPeople listen to music on YouTube?\u000a\u000aI'm so confused, why would you do that? It's such low bitrate and quite likely transcoded from another lossy format, sounds awful. :/
p6606
aVSomeone acting surprised that people use the biggest site on the internet, one that is primarily used for music listening, is the most pretentious thing I've ever read. 
p6607
aVSounds like garbage though. I can get the whole preview aspect, but it can't possibly be enjoyable for when you actually listen to music :/
p6608
aVYoutube audio is comparable in quality to an mp3 which is just fine for the 95% of users with plain-jane computer speakers.
p6609
aVIt's easy to share
p6610
aVTo sample music before buying.
p6611
aVThat I can understand, using it as your main way of listening to music though, I can not.
p6612
aVOh, of course.
p6613
aVIf you like a band enough, you will likely buy their albums. \u000a\u000aIf you don't know you like a band, either figure out if you do by listening to them via samples/youtube or torrent some FLACs if you are that much of an audiophile.
p6614
aV. . .I only listen to music on YouTube. And mostly watch live performances, for that matter.\u000a\u000aCDs I can buy. mp3s I don't understand (and I haven't downloaded music in like 10 years and have no idea how to do it anymore). YouTube is awesome.\u000a\u000aThanks for these playlists. Great work putting everything together as always, /u/UnlostHorizon 
p6615
aVI mean, if you're not going to pay for music, at least torrent that shit so it sounds good. :/\u000a\u000aI've got a whole list of CD's to buy once money comes in, but I've been listening to them from torrents for the time being.

asVBattle Beast - I Want The World... And Everything In It
p6628
(lp6629
VI personally think this album is amazing.  If you're looking for something serious, Battle Beast isn't for you.\u000a\u000aIt's cheesy as hell and they know it.  I just had a grin on my face the whole way through.  The synth lines, drums and sound effects just make the album fun from start to finish.  The lyrics are stupid, the choruses are massive and singable and the riffs are thick.  \u000a\u000aObviously it's down to personal opinion, but I feel that to some extent the over-the-top cheese and synths + silly lyrics are staple to power metal.  
p6630
aVI'm calling it. Worst album of the year. 
p6631
aVWhooo, Why if i can ask?
p6632
aVJust listen to it.  Everything i've heard from it just sounds awful. 
p6633
aVI don't know. I kinda liked it. But Sea of Dreams song is the worst. It's just bad. very bad.
p6634
aVCompared to the s/t or *Steel*... I don't know what happened. Just my opinion but I listened to their other albums again before I heard this one. They changed and whether you like it or not, that's up to you. I wish they made an album like their s/t as I find this one pretty awkward.
p6635
aVI really enjoyed this album. It has lots of epic moments and the ballads/ slower songs have an 80s/90s feel to them, which I quite like. And it is also very cheesy, like one would expect from Battle Beast.
p6636
aVI think if they manage to get one good song in, they'll be in the race for most average album.
p6637
aVYou know that's not going to last long. I bet you'll have a new worst AOTY before the end of the month.\u000a\u000aHell, BABYMETAL might release another album this year.
p6638
aVI don't listen to babymetal(Or anything from japan for that matter) so none of it would be able to be on my worst albums list. 
p6639
aVBut there's a huge trove of power metal just waiting for your critique in Japan. How much longer can PelleK and Delain be the butt of all your jokes? You must expand.
p6640
aVI just can't fathom not listening to music from an entire country, especially one with as much metal as Japan.
p6641
aVThere is much great metal from Japan. If you mean you don't like songs sung in a different language, that's understandable, but to write off millions of amazing riffs and solos, that's entirely your loss.
p6642
aVNo its not.

aVOne of my favorites
p6650
asVI know it's touchy, but we need to talk about our mod
p6651
(lp6652
VI've been a proponent for a second mod as well. It just makes a difference if the presence of a mod is actually noticeable.\u000a\u000aI religiously check the sub for the 2014 awards post every day... hope it will turn up soon.\u000a\u000a&gt; I've already overstayed my welcome\u000a\u000aThe hell. I don't know what's gone on in the past, but you're probably the biggest contributor to this sub. I'd be fine with you as a mod, and I can't think of anyone else that fits the bill.
p6653
aVI am definitely for a second mod, but when I brought this up our current mod shot this down for what I believed to be fairly weak reasons.  That said, maybe if enough people think there should be one, there will be one.
p6654
aVI agree. When a moderator postulates that a community doesn't need moderation, that just comes off as a device to justify his own (lack of) actions. Moderation is *not* obsolete. Earlier, the issue of trolling was raised and subsequently brushed off because we, as a community, will regulate ourselves with downvotes. I don't see trolling as a very huge issue, but it would not take much effort to moderate this either. So trolling is basically condoned.\u000a\u000aThe weekly release threads need stickying, and all the efforts that people put into writing elaborate band/album reviews, top 10 lists and so on, are basically lost as soon as they're off the front page. These are things I'd like to see changed.
p6655
aV&gt; That said, maybe if enough people think there should be one, there will be one.\u000a\u000aI hope that's the case... I definitely think that at least one more mod is needed, maybe even two. Even though we are a small sub that is mostly self-regulating, there are a lot of things that mods can do that aren't necessarily policing content--posting discussions, hosting AMAs, running contests and polls, etc. Plus, on the rare occasion that dealing with trolls or disputes does become a need, having more than one person available makes it easier to respond in a timely fashion, and also (may) help avoid power tripping.\u000a\u000aI mod a small subreddit myself, and at least for us, it's definitely more about helping create content and interacting with users than it is about checking content. 
p6656
aVI honestly think that a *few* mods is better than just one or two. Take a look at places like /r/Mead, they have 3000 more people than us and they have 6 mods. Or /r/cheesemaking - 2500 people TOTAL, *seven* mods.\u000a\u000aAnd we shouldn't have just two mods, because otherwise we can have drama hit where one takes over on a power trip, or completely demolishes discussion because they do not agree with it. At least, with more mods, corruption of the system is less likely to occur without overwhelming support from 50%+ of the mods.\u000a\u000aIf you aren't in the running for one of the mods though, something is wrong, you are constantly doing so much more for this sub than anyone else can claim to. You should be *one of* the new moderators.
p6657
aVYou go on some weird subreddits.
p6658
aVDude, I make my own beer/wine/mead, and my own cheese, and I bake, and I'm also a Metalhead who gets ASMR.\u000a\u000aI'm not disagreeing, the opposite in fact, *I'm a fucking wierdo.*
p6659
aV&gt; who gets ASMR.\u000a\u000aLucky bastard. It doesn't work for me.
p6660
aVYou might not have found your trigger, there are lots of different things that get people, and some are less common. Even if you don't the videos are relaxing as fuck, which is part of the appeal anyway.\u000a\u000aThat first sentence would take on a whole new meaning on Tumblr.
p6661
aVYou're like a master at enjoying life, wtf. Teach me, master!
p6662
aVStep 1: Don't have a social life.\u000a\u000aThere is no second step.
p6663
aVStep 1, check.\u000a\u000aStep 2, acquire cheese &amp; wine
p6664
aVWell thanks....\u000aNow I just want cheese and mead.
p6665
aVDo you have Milk and Lemons/Vinegar? Then you have what you need to get half of those things! Just heat about 4L of milk up until it starts to get frothy, turn off the heat and chuck in a cup or so of Vinegar or Lemon juice, and leave it go for 20-30 minutes. Pour the curds you get through a bit of double thick Muslin on a Strainer, and chuck a quarter to half tsp of salt in there and stir it in. Whack this lot in a container, lid it, and dump it in the fridge to cool down. With 4L Milk, you should be looking at about 1Kg of fucking rad Cream Cheese. It lasts a week or so.\u000a\u000aFor the Mead... That takes like 6 months so just pick some up at the bottleo or some shit.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Directions unclear, dick will get stuck in boiling milk.
p6666
aVLittle off subject but I live right next to a really nice beer store that gas some meads. I've been really wanting to pick up one called vikings blood. \u000a\u000aAs far as the cheese goes I've been wanting to get into making my own. That and bread are my two favorite things. Merica
p6667
aVGET VIKINGS BLOD. Seriously.....the best way I can describe it is Syrup that gets you drunk. It's a 19% Mead.....nothing else like it....(though I have made some impressive Ice Distilled Braggots in the past.)
p6668
aVMan I wish Mead was good down here, all we have is Maxwells and Beemead (Beemead is alright but a proper Wine-like Mead is better).\u000a\u000aMaking your own cheese is easy as, all you need is good Milk (or get yourself some Milk Powder and add Cream to it, that works brilliantly too) and some other stuff you can pick up at most Brew Shops (or online).
p6669
aVI'm lucky. Perks of living in Oregon.
p6670
aVthere's a place not to far from my house that sells amazing mead for $17 a gallon, you just have to bring your own container
p6671
aVI religiously check this sub reddit as well, but is it really that much of a problem? People have lives, things get in the way, you can't be on a site 24/7.\u000a\u000aGive it time, I'm sure we'll hear from our faithful mod and all will be well again.
p6672
aVI think it's precisely that we're not expecting our glorious leader to be on here 24/7 which is the cause of the desire for at least one more mod.
p6673
aVIt's not like anyone attacks /u/SpeakMouthWords for having a life, but the point raised is that someone that doesn't have the time to act as a mod should not be the sole mod of a community. His philosophy is that the community regulates itself, which makes the whole concept of moderation obsolete. That's only a nonsensical device to justify his own laxness as to his role. Just sayin'
p6674
aVI understand what you're saying. My biggest gripe here is that he'll come back, most likely say everything is alright and life will go on.\u000a\u000aAs much as some users say there's a problem, our mod needs to see/say it first before anything gets done.\u000a\u000aThat's why I'm not as up in arms about this as others. That and we had this same problem not long ago.
p6675
aVThat was my first thought. Actually, it was "my god, has someone checked to make sure he's still alive?" Seriously, people get hit by busses and stuff. 
p6676
aVI agree - I'm an advocate for strong moderation, so the more mods the better I say.\u000a\u000a/u/70000tonsofmetal \u000a\u000a/u/Phyralis\u000a\u000aand /u/snake_byte \u000a\u000awould be my nominations.\u000a\u000a^^Sorry ^^if ^^you ^^weren't ^^nominated, ^^this ^^only ^^concerns ^^my ^^picks ^^for ^^moderators, ^^and ^^does ^^not  ^^reflect ^^you ^^as ^^a ^^person
p6677
aVI frankly couldn't care less who became mod #2, just as long as they're active on the site.
p6678
aVAs flattered as I am, I feel like our Wizard King brushed off the earnestness of the previous concerns as being a storm in a teacup and would likely do the same again. He might have a point, things seem to shuffle along just fine in the end. 
p6679
aVWord of caution\u000a\u000aI know they are the most well-liked subreddit, but /r/atheism had this same idea... Mod #1 isn't very active, and isn't all-knowledgeable of how to run a sub, so having a Mod #2 is nice, right? Then the mod overturns and takes over a sub, kicking out Mod #1 on a TECHNICALITY.\u000a\u000aI agree on the second mod side. I urge keeping it extremely selective, with high standards.
p6680
aVMod #1 was an empty chair. He purposefully let people on his subreddit do whatever they want, believing upvotes/downvotes would take care of things. The problem with that is that reddit's system is designed so that those who want quickly consumed, shallow content that has mass appeal can easily overwhelm those looking for more content. The result was that /r/atheism was a flood of memes and circlejerking that made /r/adviceanimals and /r/circlejerk look like amateurs.  Laizzes-faire moderation works in a small community where content quality can remain high simply by virtue of what is submitted and upvoted, and incidents of extreme negativity are rare, but it breaks down relatively quickly. Through moderation, /r/atheism was able to relatively improve given that it was still comprised of atheists more concerned about complaining about religion than being a serious platform to discuss the matter. Of course, this led to an even greater flood of people complaining about 'censorship' and their memes being taken away.
p6681
aVI was there when it happened. That is not what happened.\u000a\u000aJij took charge, said he wasn't going to do anything crazy, then immediately banned all non-self posts, and flooded the modlist with subreddit collector mods from /r/MagicSkyFairy, the subreddit dedicated to trolling /r/atheism.

At least it looked like the rest of the front page subs, so it wasn't out of place. It was subtly approachable, and the comments were actually a reasonable place.\u000a\u000aAnd before the Jijover, it was only HALF macros and jokes. There was actually a lot of good content, in the form of philosophical essays, freethinker blogposts, and documentaries were posted ALL THE TIME. I saw at least 20 good, not macro, not joke posts, a week. (Not to mention all the not macro, not joke posts that I didn't care for.) I was satisfied, and my feedback during the Jijover was ignored.\u000a\u000aThe original mod came forward immediately after he was removed, and he was ultimately ignored as well. It was unethical, handled poorly, and detrimental to the sub as a whole.
p6682
aVI was there as well.\u000a\u000a&gt; then immediately banned all non-self posts\u000a\u000aWhat was banned was direct links to images, which was an effort to reduce the amount of weight that memes had on the sub.

I was satisfied, and my feedback during the Jijover was ignored.\u000a\u000aAnd you're overstating things again...\u000a\u000a[Here's](https://web.archive.org/web/20130520130040/http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/) /r/atheism just a few days before the changes took place. And [/r/atheism after the dust had settled](https://web.archive.org/web/20130618130454/http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/). I think it's rather clear which has the better balance of content...
p6683
aVI would say the nature of this subreddit compared to /r/atheism would make it much less likely to follow a similar route, but regardless i agree the process will need to be highly critical.
p6684
aVJust don't pick some of the scumbags that mod 12 different subreddits just so they can push their own agendas and ban people they don't like. There are a lot of them on this site, don't burn your own sub.
p6685
aVThis was thrown about [not too long ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2oyr1d/community_what_about_adding_more_mods/) as well. Not much more can be done at the moment.
p6686
aVWhat is it that this new mod is supposed to do? If you're looking for additional content, that's on the users of the sub, and just because you set someone up in a position of authority doesn't me that the content they're not required to create is going to be great or even positive.\u000a\u000aI like our hands-off mod, because I see no reason or need for him to be more active. Why, exactly, do we need two people doing this?
p6687
aVI thought I already made this clear. The new mod could finally get the 2014 Awards back up and running again, they could make it so that my Weekly Releases posts don't automatically get sent to the trash when I submit them, they could sticky those weekly releases (which hasn't been done for the past 3 weeks), and they could answer the modmail. That's exactly why we need a mod right now that can actually do some stuff.
p6688
aVHands-off mod: Good\u000a\u000aAbsent mod: Bad
p6689
aVIt's not like the sub has decayed into factional warfare over whether /u/mushmancat just likes DragonForce or LIKE likes them.\u000a\u000aThere's not really much to clean up and the sub polices itself well with downvotes.\u000a\u000aDo you guys want Taco Tuesdays? Like, outside of /u/UnlostHorizon's specific request for weekly threads, what do you want the guy to do?
p6690
aVDo you still perceive /u/UnlostHorizon as not being clear? We don't have many 'official' type posts, but those that we do currently aren't receiving as much attention as they could with multiple mods. And with more mods, who knows? We could have some more regular type discussions. And if shit does happen here, it's useful to have someone who can at least be around fairly often. Plus it's just good as the subreddit grows to have a larger team.\u000a\u000aAnd what harm do you see in having a second mod, if someone who's shown they can handle it is chosen?
p6691
aVList of things a second mod would change: 
p6692
aVMaybe with a second mod we could get the 2014 voting done, maybe my Weekly Releases post wouldn't have been autodeleted by the system, maybe we could actually get something stickied.

(lp6733
VIf they could start using actual guitar amps one day, that would be nice. Still, I kinda like this one.
p6734
aVWhat do you mean by "actual guitar amps" out of curiosity?  Either way I have always really enjoyed the unique tone of the guitars in Iron Savior.\u000a\u000aAs for this song, it is quite the bore to me.  Iron Savior has done a bunch of great stuff, but this song sounds too generic.  Was not a fan of any of the music off of this album, really.  Which sucks, because the artwork kicks ass.
p6735
aVI think he's been using mostly digital modeling and computer plugins forever. Which album is your favourite?
p6736
aVHmm, I see nothing wrong with it when I enjoy the sound.\u000a\u000aThe answer is EASILY *Battering Ram*.  What a magical album.  From the bad-ass, ass-kicking "Battering Ram", reaching into atmosphere with the entrancing "Wings of Deliverance" (best song of the album), and riding towards the epic and catchy "Tyranny of Steel", it is a fantastic album.  Piet is at his best here as well; vocally his most astounding album.\u000a\u000aWhat would be your favorite Iron Savior album?  To be honest, I have not gotten into them too much besides Battering Ram.  Do you have a top list of suggestions?
p6737
aVI try to get into IS whenever there is a new album, but I just can't. I think it's the mix of metal and hard rock, his voice and that guitar sound. Maybe the Ram will change my mind. I only have the first album, and I don't dislike it. :p\u000a\u000a*** Oh man, the guitar is really painful there too. Cool music, though.

p6818
(lp6819
VThanks for this - this is great.\u000a\u000aAnd either your opinion differs from the norm or mine does because, as far as favorite songs, I'd put *The Glory of Rome* and *Memory* for sure in the bottom 5 or so. And *The Seven Angels* probably amongst the top. \u000a\u000aAdditionally, I think *Shelter From The Rain* is the best recorded track on *The Scarecrow*, so meh (though live version of *The Scarecrow* is 100x better than the studio version).\u000a\u000aAs for the vocalist in *The Glory of Rome* that you're referring to - that's Rob Rock. He's awesome in everything.\u000a\u000a\u000aEDIT: I still think some of the most impressive stuff is how young Tobias is when he wrote all this. He was ~22-23 when he wrote and composed all this music. I guess that's not "young" in his career since he had Edguy going from when he was like 17/18, but still. . .
p6820
aVGlory of Rome on the bottom 5???? I couldn't disagree more, it's easily one of the strongest song on the album.
p6821
aVI'm way in the minority here.\u000a\u000a*The Tower* &gt; *Sign of the Cross* &gt; *Farewell* &gt; *Reach Out For The Light* &gt; *Serpents In Paradise* &gt; *Inside* &gt; *The Glory of Rome* &gt; *Avantasia* &gt; *Breaking Away*\u000a\u000aSo maybe not bottom 5, but nothing special. I forgot how bad *Breaking Away* is. And *Avantasia* is too generic. \u000a\u000aHonestly, that album really isn't as good as I remember it being so many years ago.\u000a\u000a
p6822
aVI have the same feeling, it felt really magical hearing the metal opera albums for the first time but time did took a toll and now... now I can't stand those albums and if I ever spin the records, I end up passing everything and the only song I really enjoy is *The Tower*.
p6823
aVI'd put Avantasia in front of Serpents, but otherwise that's pretty much my ranking as well.
p6824
aVSpot on, I appreciate the ordering of this list and The Seven Angels is easily in the top spot for the 2nd metal opera.
p6825
aVIt was pretty difficult to pick favorites from the *Metal Opera* albums. I'm honestly not that fond of those albums... I understand why it's a classic, but I feel that it has aged quite a bit. Anyway, the vocals in "The Glory of Rome" put it on top for me, especially thanks to Rob Rock (thanks for the heads up on that). The same goes for "Memory" on part 2.\u000a\u000aThat's pretty amazing, didn't think about how young he'd be! Makes sense since it's ~14 years old and he's not hit 40 yet.
p6826
aVAvantasia introduced me to the world of power metal. It's suprising but thanks to this band i've found out about Micheal Kiske, Jorn Lande and many other great vocalist
p6827
aVI found Avantasia through Jorn, actually! And from there, Edguy.
p6828
aVI'd have to disagree with your thoughts on TMO Pt. I&amp;II totally. By the time I reached the second sentence of your pt. II review I had to stop reading.\u000a\u000aThe Tower &amp; The Seven Angels is one of the greatest album closer/opener pairs in power metal.\u000a\u000aI think what you're distinctly lacking is the fact that as "opera's" / concept albums, that the story and songs work together to form part of a whole. Listening to each individual track and saying; "oh yeah that has a mean double kick and fast tempo, that's awesome power metal" (Glory of Rome) doesn't do any of the songs individually, or the album as a whole, the justice they deserve.\u000a\u000aSure, after 14 years I rarely spend two hours listening to Pt I &amp; II in order back to back. However for anyone who is new to Avantasia and getting into these albums, it's best to play the entire album, and try to listen to what's happening in the story. About 10 or 12 years ago on Tobias' old website he had a German, and English translation of the entire story of the albums. It's a pity it's gone and I haven't been able to find it anywhere recently.\u000a\u000aIt's unfortunate that he didn't make a Pt III.  While albums from 2007 onwards are good, Tobias may as well have renamed the group, as the music is considerably different, he was just trying to piggyback off the success of the first two.
p6829
aV&gt;Tobias may as well have renamed the group\u000a\u000aWhat is it with people and wanting groups to change their name when they change their sound a bit? Is it really inconceivable that someone might be interested in more than one type of music, and they might see their band/group/project/etc. as more than just fitting in one box?
p6830
aVMy reviews are song-oriented. Concept albums are no different. There's no right or wrong, just different ways of looking at things.
p6831
aVHowever, doesn't that kind of way do a disjustice to the album as a whole? After all, it's supposed to be not a mere concept album but a whole *opera* (in the name at least, don't know if some classical music buffs would agree that it fits the definition).
p6832
aVWell yeah. You could argue that I have never done justice to any particular album I have reviewed. I consciously opted for a song-orientation over album-orientation because that's how *I* listen to music.\u000a\u000aI can understand that some people are disappointed that I don't worship particular albums into the clouds. That criticism may be a little misplaced, though - my reviews aren't supposed to be objective accounts of essential albums in the first place. We've got the Essentials list for that. 
p6833
aVWoah, hold your hyperboles, man. I didn't actually anything much about what I think about it. Should it be worshipped? It's good but not the ultimate masterpiece; it doesn't always succeed at what's it trying to do, ideally even the 'low-intensity' parts that are serve as build-up to ones that 'kick' (yes, I don't know musical theory at all) would be memorable, too, and I can't say that about all of pt. 2. ...  I don't have idea what how an objective review would even look like. \u000a\u000aI found your review a couple of weeks ago and I like them (otherwise I wouldn't bother to read), and so to find you don't say anything at all about the thing as a whole was a slight disappointment. \u000a\u000aMaybe I came across as obnoxius, but strictly focusing on the invididual pieces only "because that's how I listen to music" (no matter the album) just strikes me as weird (it wouldn't suit some other genres at all). But I guess we don't discuss that there are other ways, then. (*Seven Angels* &gt; *Sign of the Cross* &gt; *The Glory of Rome* &gt; ... ).
p6834
aVDidn't mean to exaggerate.\u000a\u000aI don't think you come across as obnoxious, I just wanted to make clear that the purpose of these band writeups is to hand-pick my favorite tracks and throw them together in a YouTube playlist. It's all very personal and subjective, which I have been trying to make clear from the very beginning and have been reiterating - but there are always new readers who don't catch up on that and expect something else.\u000a\u000aIf you come to expect something that I never set out to provide in the first place, you'll obviously meet disappointment.\u000a\u000aReading back, I didn't even neglect the holistic view that much. About both albums, I wrote that apart from the mentioned tracks, the rest of the albums were largely forgettable (which is subjective, mind you). Then, in the conclusion, I wrote that each album had their own gems, and that part 1 is decidedly more solid than part 2. The only bit that I left implicit is that the albums aren't very consistent.\u000a\u000aWhat more could I have said about the albums, without sacrificing my subjectivity?
p6835
aV&gt; About 10 or 12 years ago on Tobias' old website he had a German, and English translation of the entire story of the albums. It's a pity it's gone and I haven't been able to find it anywhere recently.\u000a\u000aI have the complete story in my Metal Opera Gold Edition, might as well post it here in the upcoming days?
p6836
aVYeah please do, that would be great! I haven't read it since back then.
p6837
aVInteresting write up. Nice one!\u000a\u000aAs an aside, Avantasia seems to divide fans into: I like epic power metal and I like hard rock. I don't mind the later albums but I wish, really wish, Tobi would give us one last Metal Opera style cheesy glorious flood of tongue-in-cheek fantasy metal.
p6838
aVYou kind of had that with The Mystery of Time.  It really felt to me that he manged to blend Metal Opera and Scarecrow quite skillfully on the album.\u000a\u000aAt this point, if he were to revert back to full Metal Opera, I'm not sure it would sound like anything buy somebody trying to recapture their glory days.
p6839
aVIt shuffled slightly further down towards the metal opera side of the spectrum that's true. Yeah I guess I'd be concerned it might sound forced if he tried to do it again but anyone who know's Tobi knows he's up for a laugh and not taking himself seriously. I bet he's got a nerdy epic inside him when he's done playing rock star.
p6840
aVI really like The Metal Opera, although Part II was a bit disappointing.  The pacing is a bit off and it may have lacked some effort.  I feel like The Seven Angels would have been better as a final track on Part I. 
p6841
aVThis may be the first time we've agreed on a stand out track. Glory of Rome is one of my favorite Avantasia songs
p6842
aV[Success!](http://media.giphy.com/media/zaqclXyLz3Uoo/giphy.gif)
p6843
aVI'm really only familiar with the first two albums. I have listened to some songs of later-era Avantasia here and there (most notably "Where Clock Hands Freeze" and "Dying for an Angel") but nothing held my attention for long.\u000a\u000aThat being, said, Metal Opera I is an absolute beast of an album. "Sign of the Cross" and "Glory of Rome" are classics but my favorite is probably "Reach Out for the Light". Pretty much every song is decent. Can't say the same for II where only "The Seven Angels", "In Quest For" and "No Return" jumped out at me.

aVThe Scarecrow is easily my favorite bit of power metal ever. Jorn's notes, man. 'Better off to cry contrite tears' just fucking MAKES it so fantastic.
p6845
aVDude, I swear to god as soon as I saw this post I knew you were going to add *Devil In The Belfry* and *The Scarecrow* to the list, the Jorn factor is too powerful. I can't deny how much Jorn contributes to make these songs go from good to fucking great.\u000a\u000aAlso, Lost In Space is easily one of the shittiest songs made by Tobias, it's pop bullshit just to appeal to a bigger crowd. The shittiest song is, of course, Sleekwalk (Sleepwalking?), If you want to keep your power metal card, you have to bash this song in the next post or I'm gonna be really angry.
p6846
aVHa! I made the same post about the singles they've released (*Lost in Space* / *Carry Me Over* / *Sleepwalking*) and deleted it because I realized it didn't have a ton of relevance to this discussion.\u000a\u000aBut, yes, 100% agreed. If someone finds Avantasia from the singles, they're going to be pleasantly surprised.
p6847
aVJorn is love, Jorn is life. :D\u000a\u000aI can listen to Lost in Space and Sleepwalking and enjoy them for what they are, but in Power Metal terms they're terrible. And Carry me Over is terrible even for pop!
p6848
aVThe Angel of Babylon has a new version of Promised Land. Saying this as someone that loves Michael Kiske: it wasn't one of his good songs. Holy hell did Tobias Sammet figure out how to use Kiske's voice later though
p6849
aV&gt; it's pop bullshit just to appeal to a bigger crowd\u000a\u000aOr maybe it's pop bullshit because Tobias wanted to write pop bullshit? I actually like those songs quite a bit. No, they aren't power metal, but power metal and 'good song' aren't equivalent terms.
p6850
aV&gt;Or maybe it's pop bullshit because Tobias wanted to write pop bullshit?\u000a\u000aI highly doubt it, if there were more songs in the same pop vein, I'd say he truly wanted to change to a poppier sound, but it's not the case because everything else is pretty much fits into metal or rock. Also, the lyrics are completely irrelevant to the albums or at least, I don't see the connection. It's probably an introspection lyric style but it's such a bland and overdone ripoff from bands like U2, Coldplay, Sting and the sorts that it becomes completely irrelevant. If there's something I agree with you is that:\u000a\u000a&gt;power metal and 'good song' aren't equivalent terms.\u000a\u000aAmen.
p6851
aV&gt; but it's not the case because everything else is pretty much fits into metal or rock\u000a\u000aHe's gone into pop-rock with more than those two songs, plus he's gone into pop territory with Edguy. Plus he's covered bands like ABBA and Ultravox. Just because he's not writing every song as a pop rock ballad doesn't mean he's not interested in it - many bands include a song on their albums which are more accessible than the rest. Does Beyond the Red Mirror having a single piano ballad on it mean that Blind Guardian didn't want to write that song?\u000a\u000a&gt;Also, the lyrics are completely irrelevant to the albums or at least, I don't see the connection. It's probably an introspection lyric style but it's such a bland and overdone ripoff from bands like U2, Coldplay, Sting and the sorts that it becomes completely irrelevant.\u000a\u000aHave you looked at the rest of the lyrics on these albums? Tobias left the medieval fantasy tropes with the Metal Operas.

p6890
aVPretty fucked up lists, wasn't counting on lana del rey, let alone zacky picking taylor swift... the rev died and took their mojo, hope someday they can make great music again
p6891
aVI think that M Shadows really *really* wants to be metal, like Pantera or Metallica, but is just to something-core or what ever to be there, so he's pulling out these band names to show just how metal he is.
p6892
aVIn all fairness, A7X have been pretty core-free ever since their self-titled album came out. Their most recent album felt **a lot** like a tribute to '80s metal bands. They're just incredibly bland in my opinion nowadays. 
p6893
aVI haven't listened to them since they started writing for Call of Duty--I once went back to listen to them and was amazed at how I used to think they were the best band in the world.   Not awful, but like you said--bland.
p6894
aVAhh, A7x, my favorite band since 2nd grade turned sour to me with their newest album. I loved their music aside from the really emo faze that they had, but now they've sold out almost as badly as their favorite band, Metallica. Avenged Sevenfold had its own sound for so long, but they kept trying to achieve what was best to be called the new Metallica.\u000a\u000aThey always fall short of Metallica, because they forgot that Metallica was famous for being something new and influential. Now they sold out with their own Load Album, Hail to the King, and their own Reload album, Waking the Fallen Ressurected.\u000a\u000aHow many Veteran fans have to be lost before they give up? They are the musical form of Runescape 3.
p6895
aVWhy even bother with his/their opinion, there's no explanation for the choices, they all seem completely random as if they put a bunch of album names in a sac and chose them randomly.  Also have you even heard Lana Del Rey's album? It's awful, it's comparable to that spacey funeral doom metal in atmosphere except it sucks. Like 99.9% of all pop.

asVWhat are some of Jorns best albums?
p6922
(lp6923
VHi, I am Jorn's #1 fan. At least on here. :D\u000a\u000aLike Edledhron said, all the Masterplan albums featuring Jorn are great. These are the self-titled debut album, as well as *Aeronautics* and *Time to be King*. Aeronautics is my personal favorite.\u000a\u000aWhile it's not power metal, his solo records are awesome. *The Gathering* is a must have album, as it has remastered versions of his oldest two albums and some great covers as well. Tracks you *NEED* to listen to are "Gonna Find the Sun", "Young Forever", "Hourglass", "Gate of Tears", "Worldchanger", and "Starfire". That should get you started. After that, you can dive into the rest of his albums. \u000a\u000aI personally didn't get his first two albums. The first one has a lower production quality, and all the good songs have seen remastered editions later. All the noteworthy songs on *Worldchanger* are also present on *The Gathering*. *Out to Every Nation* would be the earliest album I'd recommend. Check out the title track and "Living with Wolves".\u000a\u000aAs for the rest of the albums:\u000a\u000a* *The Duke*: Here you should check out "Stormcrow" and "Starfire" (which is remastered).  \u000a* *Unlocking the Past*: A cover album. Cool tracks here are "Burn" and "Kill the King".  \u000a* *Lonely are the Brave*. The title track is great, and check out the bonus track "Stormbringer" if you can find it.  \u000a* *Spirit Black*: Title track is crazy awesome, "Burn Your Flame" is also crazy awesome, and "I Walk Alone" is a surprisingly crazy awesome cover of Tarja Tururnen's forgettable solo track.  \u000a* *Dio*: A tribute to his friend Ronnie James Dio, may he rest in peace. "Kill the King" you've heard earlier. My personal favorite on this one is "Stand Up and Shout". "Sunset Superman" is another great track.  \u000a* *Bring Heavy Rock to the Land*: Possibly his best album since *The Gathering*. The title track is one magnificent track, and "A Thousand Cuts" is equally awesome. "The World I See" is immensely powerful, great one. There's also a version of "Time to be King" from the Masterplan album, but IMO the Masterplan version is better.  \u000a* *Traveller*: His latest album. I didn't really like this one that much. The title track is pretty awesome, though.\u000a\u000aAnd THAT should keep you busy. Jorn is love, Jorn is life.
p6924
aVAmazing response bro, thank you so much. Going to check out your list! 
p6925
aVIf you're a fan of Jorn, I highly recommend listening to the first three Allen/Lande albums. Tons of good Jorn vocals on them and Magnus Karlsson is a consistently brilliant song writer. Will definitely turn you on to the vocal god that is Russell Allen.
p6926
aVMy favorites:\u000a\u000aMasterplan - All (Jorn) albums\u000a\u000aSolo - Lonley Are the Brave\u000a\u000aAyreon - 01011001 \u000a\u000aAvantasia - The Scarecrow\u000a\u000aArc - Burn the Sun

aVWhen it comes to his solo stuff, there really isn't a weak album in the bunch. All can be recommended.
p6930
aVEveryone else named the albums I would have, from Avantasia (check out Angel of Babylon as well) to Masterplan\u000a\u000aThe ones I can name on top of those:\u000a\u000a* [Nikolo Kotzev's Nostradamus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVsgx2qGiI). He's not on all of the songs, but he's on the best ones and he sounds awesome. Jorn vs Joe Lynn Turner\u000a* Allen Lande (All of them). The early ones were somewhat tame, but some really nice songs. [Master of Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4HyVoTwJO0) is well-known in this sub. The latest album is awesome.

aVI'm learning way more people enjoyed Pariah's Child than I did.\u000a\u000aI think Plagues of Babylon is solid (It's Iced Earth being Iced Earth, and Cthulhu is a good song) - I honestly think a lot of people's perceptions are marred by the fact that Stu now sounds like a Barlow clone.

aV&gt; 10/10\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;Not-so-greats: Far From the Fame, The Ballad of Bull\u000a\u000aWhat do you rate an album that has nothing but great tracks?
p6957
aVIt wasn't that they weren't great, it's just they weren't exactly as great as the others imo. 
p6958
asVDefenders of the Old Fest
p6959
(lp6960
VLIEGE LORD, Riot, The Rods, Exciter, High Spirits, Brocas Helm. What's not to love? I'd go if I weren't already going to another fest this year.

asVThe Privateer - Track Down and Avenge. I'm in love with violin| |Part #2
p6962

VI find that violin goes really well with power metal. I wish I saw the combination more often.

sVThis Week in Power Metal Releases (1/12 - 1/18)
p6968
(lp6969
VSlap my ass, a new Vexillum album!!!
p6970
aVWith Hansi Kürsch as a guest vocal!
p6971
aVMost amazing thing about Hansi is you just immediately recognize his voice.
p6972
aVI recognized Hansi even though I've heard very little of his work. So yeah.
p6973
aVThe first interesting week of 2015, I'd say! Time for my ultra-biased opinions! I'll limit it to the PM releases only.\u000a\u000a* **Alpha Tiger**: Uh. Well. Manpigs with bats, keeping people captive. "We won't take it anymore". Way to simplify your own message. Oh well. The song is boring, repetitive instrumentation, and while the vocalist sounds like he has potential, this song just sucks. Calling this power metal is actually quite generous.  \u000a* **Armageddon**: DEATH METAL, UNCLEAN VOCALS, RAGE. I'm not joking about the rage, they're so angry that they are flinging their guts through space.  \u000a* **Shadowbane**: The singer be like.. Yeah I'm doing a music video, and I'm sooo owning it. Anyway. This isn't as bad as Alpha Tiger, but it hardly feels like PM either. The vocalist is decent and the guitar solo is pretty good, but the song lacks vocal melody (chorus is all right), and the instrumentation could have been taken from a generic metal band.  \u000a* **Angra**: It's Angra, HYPE TO THE MAX! Kay so I've not listened to Angra much, shame on me. It sounds pretty good, I'm getting this album. The solo is sogud. I'm still waiting to be able to listen to "Black Hearted Soul", since /u/UnlostHorizon says that's the best track of the song. Oh and the fabulos lion, Fabio Lione, fronts this release! MOAR HYPE PLS.  \u000a* **Vexillium**: Now THIS sounds like Power Folk done right!  \u000a* **Orden Ogan**: Orden Ogan sounds great as usual. Powerful and catchy vocals, great chorus, superb instrumentation with kickass guitars and even some violins here and there (at least I think they are violins.. I'm terrible at telling).  \u000a* **Satan's Host**: Hey, mostly clean vocals! This is not bad at all. Wouldn't class it as PM, but hey. It sounds like Iron Maiden in many aspects, particularly the guitar solo.  \u000a* **Cyntia**: Even /u/UnlostHorizon doesn't like this. You now know enough, steer clear of this.  \u000a* **Roman Khrustalev**: 17 minutes?! Oh the time and effort I put into this. The song only kicks off at 2:10, and from there it's pretty awesome all the way through. It's instrumental only, and I don't feel that vocals would have been necessary. The music is very well written, and it's got a very serene vibe to it. Check it out if you like long progressive metal.  \u000a\u000aAllrighty then. Highlights for me were Angra and Orden Ogan. Thank you, /u/UnlostHorizon, for covering for the mysteriously vanished /u/SinuataBouquet.
p6974
aVIf you haven't listened to Vexillum before, do yourself a favor and familiarize yourself with The Bivouac. 
p6975

aV[deleted]
p6979
aVWow, Wyzard is putting out another release? I actually took a couple of lessons from Buster (the lead singer) several months ago! Dude's still going hard, and helped me push my own sound along to sounding better than it had been at the time. Can't wait to see what he puts out next!
p6980
aVI'm afraid it's just a compilation album. 
p6981
aVAh, I see. I got a little too excited lol
p6982
aVF.E.V.E.R should be good judging by everything else they have released. But yeah, Angra, I'm not sure why such a big band would choose a vocalist from another big band who has such a unique voice as a replacement but anyway. Fabio tries to copy Eduardo too much but it's still a good album. \u000a[Me backstage at BABYMETAL] (http://imgur.com/IRP8to3)
p6983
aVSTOP KICKING STAN! (that's actually my flair over at /r/SquaredCircle)\u000a\u000aI actually really liked Angra's song where they use Fabio in a decent role, like the first two tracks and "Perfect Symmetry". My issue is that there are too many guest vocalists, and too many of the songs have Fabio singing in a really strange low register that doesn't even sound like him. I still liked the album a bit, but not enough for it to make any kind of lists this year.
p6984
aVI wonder if that Thulnar record is about Magic: the Gathering
p6985
aVOff-topic, but is there a reason this topic didn't get stickied this week? Are you saving it for the 2014 Vote thing?
p6986
aV[deleted]
p6987
aVCan someone explain the lack of Angra hype? It's not a life-changing album or anything but it's decent and I honestly thought /r/powermetal would be up in arms over it.\u000a\u000aOooh new Orden Ogan and Alpha Tiger!!
p6988
aVCan you really hype an album that's already come out though? I think the hype will always be greater for an album that's about to come out.
p6989
aVFrom announcement to now it seems to have wholeheartedly flown under the radar. I expected much more buzz
p6990
aVIt had a really bad release date. It went out in Japan before the New Year causing it to clash with all the end of year stuff. 
p6991
asVA Beginner's Guide to Heavenly
p6992
(lp6993
VGreat guide. I'm itching to listen to more Heavenly right now. Although I think you should link to the music videos for Lost In Your Eyes and Fullmoon. I know they're incredibly cheesy and pointless, but if for nothing else, they're good introductions to the band.\u000a\u000aBtw, your guides are always fun to read, and your formatting is superb.
p6994
aVThanks! I had considered linking those videos, but there were just slightly too many topless dancing ladies for me to feel really comfortable about it. 
p6995
aVI figured that was the issue. Those music videos were my introduction to the band, so at least it gives people an incentive to check them out, haha.\u000a\u000aFor those who haven't seen the videos and want to (**NSFW ALERT**):\u000a\u000a"[Lost in Your Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o70DTcfBV_A)"\u000a\u000a"[Fullmoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJhZivvTvHI)"
p6996
aVGreat post, Heavenly deserves more attention! And definitely a sidebar spot with one of their albums. \u000a\u000aI've been listening a lot to Dust to Dust lately. Miracle is truly an amazing song, and Fight for Deliverance is also pretty cool.
p6997
aVI listen to a lot of music at work, and the cover of their 2009 album is the main reason I have avoided Heavenly :\u005c\u000a\u000alol
p6998
aVAwesome! Thanks for this, Heavenly is one of my favorites but I haven't heard all their stuff so this is neat.
p6999
aVGreat guide, thanks for this.\u000a\u000aHowever I wouldn't pick any of the songs you posted as my tops, it's kinda funny.\u000a\u000aMy favorites would probable be these:\u000a\u000aPromised Land (Coming from the Sky)\u000a\u000aDefender (Coming from the Sky)\u000a\u000aThe World Will Be Better (Sign of the Winner)\u000a\u000aStill Believe (Sign of the Winner)\u000a\u000aFight for Deliverance (Dust to Dust)\u000a\u000aIllusion pt. 2 - Call of the wild (Dust to Dust)\u000a\u000aBravery in the Field (Virus)\u000a\u000aPower and the Fury (Virus)\u000a\u000aOde to Joy (Carpe Diem)\u000a\u000aAshen Paradise (Carpe Diem)
p7000
aVthanks for this! the first time I heard Heavenly was because of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_BHWLebhhQ) anime video. Spill Blood on Fire is such a fantastic song.
p7001
aVMake sure you message speakmouthwords so he sees this and posts it to the sideboard.

aVHeavenly would need a spot on the sideboard first =(\u000a\u000a

p7004
aVI had to stop at the first album because I'd heard every idea before, and that André Matos upward twist really grinded my gears, but I'll listen to these suggestions. 
p7005
aVYeah, it really depends what you're looking for. Their first 2 (and arguably last 2) albums are supposedly very derivative (I'm not very familiar with the bands they're influenced by, so idk). \u000a\u000aIf nothing else, take a look at *Dust to Dust* - it really is a fantastic album. 
p7006
asVPower Quest - Glory Tonight
p7007
(lp7008
VThis was the album that got me into Power Metal, with this song and Far Away being the ones that really hooked me. I can listen to this song everyday and never get sick of it. It's a shame this band is no longer together as they are certainly my favourite.
p7009
aVI love you ^_^
p7010
aVFrom their demo they also had DragonForce's ZP Theart on vocals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcwjWEToscs

(lp7018
VGod, Goetz Mohre is such a fantastic vocalist.\u000a\u000aThat guy just needs to get on joining a new band, power metal needs his voice.\u000a\u000aThe band is otherwise a talented bunch of individuals. But mostly Dushan Petrossi, the guitarist. He's something of a Yngwie clone, but he's a good one.
p7019
aVGreat album, good start to being "new"
p7020
aV:)
p7021
aVMy favorite Iron Mask song! I love how Petrossi goes all out in his playing in the ending. 
p7022
aVThis whole album is golden. But i can't decide which song from this album is my favourite. Holy War or [Freedom's Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n45uDcnNTmk). Can't choose.
p7023
asVThe Theatre Equation
p7024
(lp7025
VDamn, I'm really jealous, that is one of the best concept albums I've ever heard, hope it comes out on DVD
p7026
aVThis is so so tempting. I was originally deciding between ProgPower and this and ended up getting the ProgPower tickets assuming I'd be living in the US.\u000a\u000aNow I'm going to be in Europe, so I'm wondering if I could sneak down to the Netherlands for the weekend and catch this show as well. I think I'm going to make it happen. This is one of my five all-time favorite albums.
p7027
aVYou definitely should if you can, but I think the tickets are all sold out. It's gonna be a once in a life time experience to see this!

aVThat is the new song title?  "Pathfinder is Striking Back"?  Really?  I am losing hope for my favorite band... quickly.
p7038
aVEager to hear what their new sound is like without their former singer. He was fantastic, with a range not many could match. Does anyone know who the new singer is? 
p7039
aVThey talk about him in the promotional video for this IndieGogo campaign. He has an unpronounceable name.

aVI do like Tommy, he's more than capable and Silverthorn was a fantastic album. I'm seriously looking forward to seeing them live next year. But... Khan :(
p7055
aVA lot of you have probably heard this one, but I found the climax to this live version so powerful I wanted to share!
p7056

VTHE 2014 AWARDS WERE A SHAM!  SABATON WON BEST LYRICS! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?  
p7064
aVPoor Falconer :( 
p7065
aVI don't think anyone who voted for Sabaton was actually voting for the quality of the lyrics.
p7066
aVI just want to know who voted for this. Lurkers? Maybe.\u000a\u000aBecause we were all having pretty solid discussion and I don't think the bands/people/songs/art that won the awards were even discussed in the threads.\u000a\u000a\u000aI like Sabaton. I just don't like their recorded work (minus 'Carolus Rex' in Swedish). But I could watch them live every day of the week. Their recorded material has very little replay value, imo.
p7067
aVI didn't vote at all. Why? Because i did not listen to half of the nominated bands. Maybe there were more people like me, but they voted anyway.
p7068
aVI'm a HUGE fan of Sabaton and you are spot on. Part of why I like Sabaton is the simplicity of the lyrics. It's nothing poetic. It's easy to memorize and sing along with and get you charged up.
p7069
aVAlright then. I am indifferent towards guitar solos. They don't really matter to me. I mean, sure, they're nice to listen to and I can enjoy them, but ultimately they aren't going to make a song better or worse for me, and I quickly forget about it until I hear it again. I just don't remember them, never really do. I've listened to "Mirror Mirror" over 100 times, and I couldn't tell you how the guitar solo goes. I didn't nominate nor vote in the 'Best Guitar Solo' category in the 2014 PM Awards, because I couldn't remember any. \u000a\u000aI've seen many times when people talk about metal songs, that they're complementing a solo, saying that kicked ass, it made a mediocre song worthwhile or that it sucked, etc., while I'm just like, "Hmm....". I can never agree or disagree. 
p7070
aVI can see where you're coming from. A lot of the times my opinion is that a solo was just thrown in the song for the sake of a solo.  But there are times, certain bands, that actually know how to write a solo.  Lost Horizon solos each feel like they are sculpted specifically for that song.  Randy Rhoads solos feel that way too.  
p7071
aVSolos are just like the well known verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus. Bands do them because it's almost a staple in power metal.
p7072
aVI think that unless a solo is warranted, it shouldn't just be  thrown in. However, I appreciate when a guitarist gets to show his chops at least once in an album.\u000a\u000aAlthough, you can always show them through awesome riffs as well. Michael Romeo from Symphony X does that nonstop. This is why I really appreciate songs that have legitimately interesting musical structures rather than power chord grinding. I'm looking at you, gloryhammer.
p7073
aVI originally listened to power metal for the solos. It depends if you actually play the instrument or not, because I didn't even like metal before I started playing guitar. (to be honest, I didn't even know what was and wasn't metal, when my guitar teacher was like 'oh, so you like metal, do you?' I was like wtf this is considered metal? back when I was 12)\u000a\u000aI can say that when you can visualize what the guitarist is playing it makes solos more interesting to listen to. "oh, that technique is pretty crazy" etc.
p7074
aVThat could be part of the reason. I don't play any instruments and never have. And my instrument knowledge is quite poor as well. 
p7075
aVI am your polar opposite. I came to metal for the solos. Power metal exemplifies it. I recall solos more than lyrics. Admittedly though some solos can be forgettable while others can be the highlight.  
p7076
aVI cut my metal teeth on old thrash and yngwie malmsteen.  Solo all the songs!
p7077
aVThis is exactly how I am. Thrash is my favourite style of music and the first style of metal I really latched on to. There's a great interview in Get Thrashed where one musician (can't remember who) mentions that they wanted to play punk, but be like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest and show that they were really great musicians. That sounds really appeals to me as well, and I think power metal exemplifies that too (not the punk part, more that power metal bands want you to know how good they are).
p7078
aVI agree with you guys (read my Pathfinder reply above). Guitar shredding in songs is like a drug to me. Light-speed arpeggios and alternate picking; I can't get enough! 
p7079
aVCouple of opinions;\u000a\u000a**Non PM**\u000a\u000aI was actually going to revive this idea Tomorrow. In fact, I meant to do this last Saturday, but we had way too much (2014 awards, New Releases), so it would have been lost in the shuffle. (Hell, I even got /u/Marodox1 blessing on this as well!) But whatever, it's here. (little miffed, but what's done is done)\u000a\u000a**PM Issue**\u000a\u000aIs everyone really caring about the production issues of Beyond the Red Mirror? Clearly, no one has heard Dark Moor's Shadowland album. That's the epitome of bad.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of Blind Guardian; Worst album IMO; Night At the Opera. Why you say? It's a fucking chore to get through. There are many amazing songs on there (Precious Jerusalem, Battlefield, and Punishment Divine is one of my all time favourites) but to go from start to finish is a nightmare. I need a nap after listening to this thick as mud album. At least Battlions of Fear was short.
p7080
aVFeel free to take it over next week. 
p7081
aVWill do, thanks for being understanding.
p7082
aVI said it in the album thread, but I have no issues with Beyond The Red Mirror's production. It sounds fine to me.
p7083
aVI have never understood people's love for Lost Horizon. They're pretty solid but not one of my favorite power metal bands.
p7084
aVSo I'm *not* the only one! 
p7085
aVDefinitely not. They're a good band, but not an amazing one. 
p7086
aVMy response exactly.
p7087
aVYep. Excellent singer who hasn't sung anything worthy since. And the two LH albums were great but hardly essential. 
p7088
aVThey don't have to be your favorite, they just have to be realized that their style is the style that power metal fans truly appreciate in a very well laid-out form.
p7089
aVUuh... what? There are a wide variety of power metal styles, and none of them can claim to be the one for 'true' fans.
p7090
aVi said nothing about true fans, i said about being able to truly appreciate the general style\u000a\u000ai said it's generic basically
p7091
aVPlus they have some of the most obnoxious, very vocal fanboys as well.
p7092
aVNighwish's lead singer makes me sleepy.
p7093
aVHow about this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5v2qIo1nFo
p7094
aVIsn't it the same vocalist?
p7095
aVIt is. I was giving an example of her other work, in case you were just bored by the two songs released recently.
p7096
aVWhat do people see in Pathfinder!!?!??! I don't get it, am I too fucking stupid? Is the album too superior for me??? WTF! Why does it get so much praise??\u000a\u000aEverybody says Blind Guardian's album has production issues, very minimal ones but it does have. WHAT ABOUT PATHFINDER'S FUCKING FIRST ALBUM??? It's a fucking abomination production-wise!! It's easily the worst production in an album. They may be a Polish band but this album is anything but polish-ed (sorry). Some say Hansi vocal style is hard to get into which I fully disagree (he has the voice of a power metal god). PATHFINDER'S VOCALIST ON THE OTHER FUCKING HAND DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SING AND IS CONSTANTLY HITTING NOTES SO FUCKING HIGH THAT HIS MIDDLE NAME CAN ONLY BE TINNITUS. How would you feel ^waaaaaa if I would started shouting ^waaaaaaaa in every fucking random phrase ^waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa of every post??\u000a\u000aThe lyrics are also a problem (obviously). I have no fucking clue what they are talking about despite several efforts from my part.\u000a\u000a&gt;We are beyond the space, beyond the time we are flying away,\u000a\u000a&gt;Where the dreams still meet a reality.\u000a\u000a&gt;We are beyond the light, beyond the dark,\u000a\u000a&gt;Where the space-time continuum and the wonder of life has its end.\u000a\u000aWhat is this? So many part of the lyrics are so abstract that they could be about anything and at the same time, they are about nothing. I always had a hard time with lyrics but I do make the effort to understand them but this album... This fucking album. If I was in a life threatening situation and my means of survival were to understand either these album lyrics or quantum physics, I would easily choose quantum physics, I would die either way but at least I could have learned something.\u000a\u000aLastly, my biggest gripe with these guys. There's no songwriting to be found here! They do not write songs, they have bouts of spastic seizures, play whatever their hyperactive mind can come up with and then mesh everything together in what they call "songs" (I call it abominations) in the most non-cohesive manner. The songs start in a style and end in a completely different one suffering several transformations in between, it's like they have fucking Alzheimer's (sorry to everyone who endures the disease directly or indirectly on a daily basis) and they keep forgetting what song they are playing.\u000a\u000aI feel sorry for Dragonforce who often get compared to this horrible contraption, Dragonforce may have written and rewritten the same song over and over again and sold them with a different name but at least it's well written, well produced and well defined (structure wise).\u000a\u000aCan someone elucidate me or give a brother a helping hand because I could delve into all the problems that Pathfinder has and I would only be over when my beard hit my fucking knees.\u000a\u000aI missed these posts btw and sorry for the long ass post. Had the worst week of my life. &lt;3
p7097
aVI agree with this. Pathfinder sucks.
p7098
aVPathfinder is my fav PM band, and BTSBTT is my fav song and album. Pathfinder is completely "over-the-top" in every department including vocals, guitar shredding, orchestra, form, etc. (I won't comment on production since I'm clueless on that aspect). You have to understand that some people like me really love the "over-the-top" feel, and Pathfinder IMO capture it the best. The vocals do go into these random falsetto highs, but I love it. The falsetto in BTSBTT was the highest pitch note I've ever heard from a PM male singer, and it blew my mind; that's why I loved it. The guitar shredding could be considered distasteful, but trust me, as a guitar shredder myself, I go on these binge listens looking for Ynqwie clones and sometimes all I want in a song is light-speed arpeggios and alternate picking; crazy guitar shredding is like a drug to me, I'm completely serious. I know people compare Pathfinder to DragonForce, but when talking to a mainstream audience of people not used the style, there are few other bands they might know of with "over-the-top relentless guitar shredding" backed up with orchestration. As for the lyrics, and trust me, I've studied massive amounts of poetry in college: it's not "great," but the "over-reacher" theme that is found in some PM is delineated to extremes. The lyrics are abstract and metaphysical, but they're essentially showing how people should be ultar-positive, self-actualize, and transcend into the greatest state they can be in; it's humanistic, existentialist, melioristic, etc. The philosophy is there if you're open to interpreting it with close reading. These philosophical themes are not just embedded in the lyrics but in the transcendental nature of the songs: fast, positive, yearning, and "high" or ascending. The subject of "good songwriting" is subjective; I love long pieces, and if the song is 95% guitar shredding and falsettos: all the better for me. I hope my paradigm opens up your mind about why people like me love Pathfinder. All the best! 
p7099
aVMy favorite way to explain why I like it is its a black metal album disguised as power metal. Its the power metal equivalent of Tara. Everything is turned to 11. 
p7100
aVNever have you made so little sense to me.
p7101
aVHaha. All I'm saying is if absu wrote power metal it would sound like btsbtt. 
p7102
aVI like them because they're completely absurd and over the top. Dragonforce is like that too, but Dragonforce's absurdity is mostly limited to guitar solos, whereas Pathfinder throws absolutely everything at you in excess (vocals, guitar solos, song structures, symphonics, lyrics, etc.
p7103
aVDragonforce's vocals are actually pretty nuts. While ZP sounds like he sings higher, Marc Hudson actually does. \u000a\u000aOutside of that, they may not sing as high as other bands, but they still sing at the top of the tenor range. What gives it another dimension of difficulty is that it's being done at a lot of 180 BPM songs. You are having to focus on what makes you sound good at a high range while enunciating really fast
p7104
aVI didn't mean to say Dragonforce has had bad vocalists (ZP is probably in my top 5 power metal singers). I meant more that Pathfinder's vocals are ridiculous because their singer displays his entire range seemingly almost on command, and there isn't as much sense to what he's doing as there is to what a band like Dragonforce does. In that respect, I think Pathfinder's vocals are more over the top just because they're kinda crazy. I enjoy ZP and Hudson way more (in fact, I'm a huge Dragonforce fan!).
p7105
aV&gt; I didn't mean to say Dragonforce has had bad vocalists \u000a\u000aAh, I didn't mean to imply that you did. \u000a\u000aA lot of people underestimate Dragonforce vocals. I started on the path to learning how to sing power metal and did Dragonforce initially for kicks, and I quickly found out that they are a tricky band to do. \u000a\u000aI have a much harder time with Marc Hudson vocals over ZP's, even though I like ZP's more. However, with the way Maximum Overload went, Marc Hudson is growing on me
p7106
aVFuckless Friday? \u005cm/
p7107
aVI'm not into the "million guys singing in unison like a group of warriors" that sabaton and often blind guardian employ. I've been trying to find out why I don't like these two bands when everyone else on this subreddit seems to like them, and this is probably why. Like I can appreciate their music, but it's not something I would like to listen to a ton of times or put in my library.
p7108
aVWith Nightwish coming in a few months I have really been trying to get through their discography...and I just can't do it...I just can't get into Nightwish. There's nothing about it that excites me or draws me in, I get kinda bored. 
p7109
aVI like the Deris Helloween better. I like post-Helloween Kiske better than Helloween Kiske
p7110
aVI wholeheartedly agree. Kiske is an amazing singer, but Deris meshes much, much better with the band, and they fit as this more aggressive, yet melodic power metal that focuses on both vocals and instrumentation equally. I really like where Helloween is right now and where Kiske is right now.
p7111
aVI honestly like both so much it's hard to decide. The problem with Kiske-era is that it really gets by solely on two albums. But those two albums are so good and so important to power metal, that I can't not put Kiske ahead of Deris.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, you have to respect the band for going out and finding a singer who sounds nothing like Kiske, and building an identity around him. Perhaps even more amazingly, the band has been better in their second decade with him than they were in their first.\u000a\u000aAlso, as much as I love Deris, he can't do the Kiske songs justice live. I actually enjoyed the Deris-era songs much more when I saw them. 
p7112
aVI'll get us started. I have a few grievances i'd like to vent about.  \u000a\u000aSabaton fans have surpassed Dragonforce fans as the most obnoxious fanbase in power metal.  Everything Sabaton does is the greatest thing ever according to them. If there was ever a band undeserving of their popularity its Sabaton.  Now, I will say, I actually really enjoyed The Art of War and to a lesser extent, Carolus Rex, but for the most part they are way, way below par. And what they write can barely be called metal.  At least with Dragonforce, they wrote stuff that sounded like metal.(Albeit, a very poor attempt) Sabaton is bombastic pop music. \u000a\u000aInb4 800 responses telling me that Sabaton don't take themselves seriously. \u000a\u000a\u000aIf you don't like harsh vocals in any capacity, you shouldn't consider yourself a metalhead.  I don't know if its me, and I never go around telling everyone i'm a metalhead, but on the inside I identify as what one would call a metalhead.  If you don't like harsh vocals you are just a giant vagina. \u000a\u000aI don't know if i'm mentioned this before or now, but Japanese metal is a scourge.  I came across [this steaming pile](https://www.reddit.com/r/kawaiiMetal) the other day and found myself on the verge of subconsciously jamming a shiv into my wrist.  This is the worst stuff i've ever heard and i'm positive all the fans of this shit also have a girlfriend stuffed with cotton.  
p7113
aVIsn't half the point of power metal that it isn't all harsh vocals all the time though?
p7114
aVAn anti-mainstream opinion? I admire your originality!
p7115
aVIt looks like you had a lot bottled up.
p7116
aVMy blood pressure was through the roof before that post. 
p7117
aVHarsh vocals for me are workable, but not if they're completely unintelligible. Also, for me the only place they really seem to fit is in something really bleak-themed like black metal.\u000a\u000aAlso, bringing out the anger in the song with intermittent harsh vocals is something I appreciate. Spamming harsh vocals because they can't find an actual singer gets aggravating for things like metalcore crap and such.
p7118
aV&gt; Sabaton fans have surpassed Dragonforce fans as the most obnoxious fanbase in power metal\u000a\u000aAgreed. \u000a\u000a&gt; Japanese/kwaii metal is a scourge\u000a\u000aAgreed for the most part. There are exceptions.\u000a\u000a&gt; Sabaton undeserving/below par/they don't write metal/pop music/Art of War &gt; Carolus Rex\u000a\u000alol fuck no.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p7119
aV&gt; they don't write metal\u000a\u000aIts true.  Trust me, In the heated debate I had with some friends about Sabaton, I supported them.   They eventually won me over.  What they are writing isn't metal.  \u000a\u000aThe same people who call Sabaton Metal call Blink 182 punk. 
p7120
aVThey are the power metal Eluveitie.
p7121
aVOut of curiosity, what is your rationale for this? I haven't heard this argument before.\u000a\u000a
p7122
aVYou're my favorite person to love and hate.
p7123
aVI like Sabaton, but they have only a very limited number of songs that are great and the rest are mediocre and the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over again.
p7124
aVWe really need to stop posting Blind Guardian and Sabaton here, unless there are some news/new songs from them. They are basically just ways to get free karma at this point. I think they should be blacklisted to an extent and sticky them, because either people can't find the /r/powermetal recommendations' link because it's not highlighted enough, or they just don't want to find it because of those sweet, sweet, meaningful karma points.\u000a\u000aAlso, why are albums and bands from other sub-genres included in the power metal weekly release threads? It says so in the name that it's POWER metal, not FOLK metal or DEATH metal. I understand it if they are fusions, but 90% of the time, they're not. Is it just me who doesn't understand this?\u000a\u000aAlso, I don't get the fascination with prog? Don't get me wrong, I like it, but most metalheads just absolutely goes crazy over it. Most of the power/prog bands are just really bland and boring.
p7125
aVThe weekly release threads are for power metal albums and releases that might appeal to power metal fanbase. Melodic Death metal and power metal are very similar, hence why you see melodeath albums occasionally. 
p7126
aVAgreed on your last point. I really struggle with prog bands. There are only a couple I really like: Queensryche and Savatage.\u000a\u000aWhen bands do power/prog, it rarely works. Straight forward power metal is much better. This is one reason why I'm not sure if I'll ever go to ProgPower. Half of the lineup is usually really killer, and half of it is boring.

Absolutely one of my favorites.\u000a\u000aBetween his stuff with Yngwie, At Vance, Candlemass, and Therion (I'm not familiar with Krux, unfortunately), he's as versatile as it gets in the metal genre.

asVAnthriel - Devil's Lullaby
p7142
(lp7143
VThis whole album is pretty awesome in my opinion.\u000a\u000aI get the vibe that the whole thing is kinda like a concept album about escaping the past and starting anew, but I haven't checked the lyric book (despite having listened to the whole thing through at least 10 times) so I won't place any money on that assertion. 
p7144
aVIt's a great album. [Chains of the Past is my favorite.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RcCy_92K_4) So many good harmonies.   \u000a\u000a&gt;But how could I leave without a wound      \u000a&gt;in the spirit that carries me on? *(carries me on!)*\u000a
p7145
aVThe album is based on the character from fantasy writer R.A. Salvatore named [Drizzt Do'Urden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drizzt_Do%27Urden). The Pathway is based on the events of the [Dark Elf Trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Elf_Trilogy) of books concerning Drizzt.\u000a\u000aI've been waiting for these guys to make another album for years.\u000a\u000a

asVThought experiment: What if Michael Jackson had sung power metal?
p7148

aVI am imagining The Trooper chorus being sung with all "hee heees" instead of "ooooh ooooohs."  
p7151
aVOh God that's funny :D
p7152
aVIndependent of his ability to fit into the vocal stylings of the genre, Michael Jackson certainly would have made some incredible, world-class music videos with power metal imagery.\u000a\u000aI feel like his ability to dance would have been wasted, though.
p7153
aVAre there any black folks in power metal at all? I can think of bands that have black guys for every other subgenre of metal, but I'm at a complete loss for power metal.
p7154
aVMaybe in one of the smaller Brazilian bands... ?
p7155
aVI wanted [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4fb5hxiaXM) to win the Pathfinder competition. He looks like a Black/Latino mix
p7156
aVSo, I took a quick look/ Turns out that that South African power metal bands are almost always made up of white South Africans.\u000a\u000a:/
p7157
aVVince Dennis of Steel Prophet is a black dude in a power metal band: http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Vince_Dennis/20283

p7159
aVIt would be epic
p7160
aV[deleted]
p7161
aVWould be pretty great in my opinion
p7162
aVIt would have worked. He probably wouldn't sing like he did his own songs. His voice is quite soulful. I feel one of the closer voices to his is [Tony Kakko's of Sonata Arctica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bwtlBPcsrw), though [Jackson's has a lighter timbre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-qaXtFoUU0). \u000a\u000a\u000a

V&gt; Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/li4KvcT.gif
p7166
aVHey guys, sorry about being gone, I have been in a pretty shitty slump, and needed to sort myself out. Now that I am back though, it's time for some glorious Power Metal!\u000a\u000aMy Opinion (based on previews only):\u000a\u000a- **Reason:** Flows from Video Game Battle Music into a guitar solo and then into a regular Prog Metal song. It's a decent song, with some good variety throughout it, which helps since it is a longer song. I will admit that slower prog isn't as appealing to me as faster stuff, so I wouldn't have minded it sped up or cut shorter, but that is just me. I can't complain about the amount of guitar solos though.\u000a\u000a- **Visigoth:** I really like how much faster this song is than the previous from Reason. It has some great variance, jumping into an Acoustic section and then back, and has a great solo. I might be biased by my love for Tabletop RPGs though, so that might be affecting my opinion.\u000a\u000a- **Frosttide:** Are you headbanging within 10 seconds? You should be, this is Folk Metal after all. I really like the speed and intensity of the instrumentation. I'm 50/50 about the vocals, because while I like the growl, it seems a little out of tune or time. That might be just me, but it does bother me a bit.\u000a\u000a- **Gamma Ray:** I'll skip this because it is an ad and not a song, interesting interview though.\u000a\u000a- **Blind Guardian:** Blind Guardian? Come on now, I can only get *so* erect.\u000a\u000aWhat I missed:\u000a\u000a- **Alborea:** This is a solid song. The vocals are *Glorious*, and the instrumentation is great fun. I like the way they flow between rougher sounds and softer symphonic sounds, it adds an interesting feature to the music. Overall, I enjoyed this a quite a bit.\u000a\u000a- **Veonity:** Man this song is fucking great. I had a laugh at the start about how campy the start sounds, but mate the rest is fucking awesome. They certainly don't lose the campiness, but they throw some much more on top that the defining characteristic isn't just that it is over the top. It has amazing levels of drive and speed. I really like this song.

p7168
aVMy thoughts on the non-compilation PM releases:\u000a\u000a* **Visigoth**: Hey, some kick-ass viking metal? This sounds really promising. The instrumentation is nice and fast, the guitars kick some serious ass! These guys sound really interesting but I wasn't satisfied with the vocals in this one (he sings well, I probably just don't like that particular song). I looked around and [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1JB5kA3_o) is a lot better in the vocals department, and kicks some serious ass! It's off their EP, and will be on the actual album and I'm hoping it'll be a remastered version.  \u000a* **Blind Guardian**: I'm not a Blind Guardian fanboy, but holy schmuck "Twilight of the Gods" is one magnificent track. I don't know what it is, as people tell me this is pretty standard BG stuff. There's just something else about this track. I guess it's closer to my own personal notion of power metal, or something. It kicks so much ass.  \u000a* **Alborea**: This sounds nice and melodic. The vocals are in Spanish (I think). It's actually pretty damn good instrument-wise, and I'm not a huge fan of the voice but this should be enjoyable for those who don't mind non-English vocals.  \u000a* **Veonity**: A very anthemy (I officially declare anthemy a word) song. It's pretty standard fare PM instrumentation... While there aren't really and bad points to this one, it doesn't really have much to get you excited either. It's enjoyable, but not really memorable. It sounds like every other PM song. Doesn't bring much new to the table, but by all means check these guys out.\u000a\u000aThe highlight of the week is, without a doubt, Blind Guardian. However, this track has been around for a couple of months now, so I'm more excited to have learned about the existence of Visigoth.

aVI opened a new tab for the Visigoth preview. Didn't really think it was any special, and I just kept browsing reddit with the song on. Then the song ended... and a new one started. I didn't notice it at first, but it hit me when I heard growling. Confused, I went to the YT tab. Youtube had randomly started playing a full album video of Job for a Cowboy's 2014 release, *Sun Eater*. And I'm digging the hell out of it. I remember when it was included in the weekly thread about 2 months ago, but I didn't listen to the preview (no one even reviewed it!). So yeah, at least I discovered something that I liked from this thread, hehe.\u000a\u000aI've been listening to Blind Guardian's album every day for the past week. It's amazing.\u000a\u000aI'm on a similar boat as /u/MisterMillennia when it comes to Frosttide.

VIs Lost Horizon too obvious?\u000a\u000aOther than them, there aren't really many bands I want to put out a new album. It would be cool if Metalium reunited because I think their move to heavy/power suited them much better than their early sound. I love the last two Metalium records, and wouldn't mind hearing another in that style. I should probably finish collecting the rest of their discography though.
p7215
aVPower Quest. It was only a couple of years ago that they broke up but they were the band that got me into Power Metal so they have a special place in my metal heart.
p7216
aVYeah, same here! They had so much potential to make it even further with their new vocalist they had gotten just a few months before their split-up too!
p7217
aVThey broke up at the worst time, too. I honestly feel their last album was their best work, as though they'd finally perfected their sound.
p7218
aVThat's exactly the one I was thinking of!\u000a\u000aDreadful shame, that. I wonder what Williams is doing now...
p7219
aVSo very true. One of the biggest losses to PM. Unfortunately I don't think this is likely to happen. Steve W has moved on to Eden's Curse and most of the others are deeply involved in their own bands too.

p7239
aV&gt; Instanzia\u000a\u000aI'm not sure they count here considering they've promised a new album for this year. They haven't gone anywhere.
p7240
aVMy mistake, I was mainly thinking about bands that are still considered active (no news good news?) but haven't put out an album in quite some time. I'm aware Instanzia are coming up with a new album (as are Insania and Heavenly) but it always gets postponed to a later date and at this rate I'm getting troubled...\u000a\u000a(as an example, a greek power metal band I know - Emerald Sun - were supposed to have their new album out by 2012-2013. It's 2015 and the album is yet to come out...)
p7241
aVCellador are actually having lots of shows. Just that they don't have a label for releasing a new album i think. They released a new EP like 2 years ago.\u000a\u000aInstanzia are active, working on their new album.\u000a\u000aDream Evil, no one friggin knows. I hope they release another album.

aVFor Power Metal, Lifeform/Barsoom, Epiclore, Furthest Shore, Camlann,  Tuatha de Danann, Ashtar and Excalion are all bands I'd love to see get back together (if they're split up) and make something new. \u000a\u000aFor non-Power Metal, definitely Pulse or Damned Spirits' Dance.
p7253
aVFirst off, Heavenly. Technically still active, but their new album has been indefinitely delayed, from what I've heard. Powerquest is another one I'd like back. Aquaria would be a good one. Fairyland is kind of in the same boat as Heavenly, technically still around but might as well not be. Also, I want the *old* Spellblast back. They're still around and performing, but it's Spellblast in name only. They've 100% changed their style. Not that the new stuff is bad, it's just not what it was.

aVbut then again, that's what japanese power metal is and it has j-rock written all over it a lot of the time \u000a\u000aalso tbh, I like Kamijo and Jupiter better than Versailles..

aV&gt; I like Kamijo and Jupiter better than Versailles\u000a\u000aAgreed. But *Noble* is still the best thing any of those groups ever did.

p7308
aV**Furor Gallico: Songs from the Earth** - To little to work with.\u000a\u000a**Whyzdom: Symphony for a Hopeless God** - Very odd song, it's overly dramatical and actually made me feel tense, I'm not sure if that's bad or good. The song opens with its dark atmosphere and remains in the darkness for the whole 7 minutes... I like it. Overall it's a very well done song in my opinion, if you are into more poppy melody driven songs, this is not for you.\u000a\u000a**Cyntia: Woman** - Small sample but it sounds like something coming out of a 80/90s cock rock band.\u000a\u000a**Ensiferum: One Man Army** - YES! Ensiferum! GRAB YOUR BLOODY AXES! TO BATTLE WE RIDE!!! The song is Ensiferum undoubtly and that should be enough to tell you that it's good, fucking good. ONE MAN ARMY!!! If you are into fucking metal, this is for you!\u000a\u000a**Svartsot: Vældet** - Decent Folk Metal, I think the vocals are really good and so are the folkloric bits.\u000a\u000a**Masters of Disguise: The Savage and the Grace** - Huh.. After a few head scratches, it appears this band is a tribute to Savage Grace. What an odd band to pay tribute, some of the guys even played live with Savage Grace. Back to the album, it sounds like fun power/speed/heavy metal in the same vein as Savage Grace..... They even got the fucking police guy in the cover, kind of hilarious in it's own cvlt way.\u000a\u000a**Exxplorer: Symphonies of Steel** - Oh man, fucking exxplorer, the whole album is a small unknown bag of gems. Think Manowar with a over the top voice production, less punchy guitars and a more power metal vibe. I recommend the whole album.\u000a\u000a**Lord Fist: Green Eyleen** - Sounds like it's coming straight from the fucking 80s. Decent metal but you know, you get the taste of sickness after eating too many ambrosias (maybe you don't know), it's good but you already got so much of it that it feels tiresome.\u000a\u000a**Lapis Lazuli: The Downfall of Humanity** - Every. Single. Symphonic. Metal. Band... Always female driven. Anyway, snooze fest song, too many boring keyboarding and special effects.\u000a\u000a**Scanner: The Judgement** - Haven't heard Scanner in a long time, Their first album had Knoblichs voice and in comparison... I don't really like this guy. Song is ok, it's nothing special, not like I'm expecting Scanner to return and pull an album out of their ass that's as good as the first one.\u000a\u000aWhat **I** may have missed last week...\u000a\u000a**Beyond Reason: A New Reflection** - Can't make the connection, I know these guys sound like some other band but I can't fucking name it. Very good song, with a different style of riffing, very headbangable. Good controlled vocals, he doesn't go too overboard but doesn't hold himself back either. Good solo too.\u000a\u000a**Nightwish: Élan** - Too soft, too held back, too slow. This would fit a pop rock opera a lot more than a symphonic metal album. It's a good song regardless, just not what I want from a Symphonic Metal labeled band.\u000a\u000a**Ranger: Storm of Power** - A fucking bow to old school speed metal, a fresh perspective that adds the good ol' speed metal I love so much with a Thrashier vocal style that I believe it fits perfectly. Hey, it's not original but it's fucking fast and ends on a high note.\u000a\u000a**Seventh Dimension: Recognition** - Finally, some progressive power that cuts the bullshit and goes straight to the juice so you don't have to peel out the whole fucking fruit. Looking at the album suggests a different path, 80 minutes of metal is way too much and I can only imagine the amount of self-indulgence and noodle wankering that can be found in the album (might not be true, I haven't heard the album). Very good song, some might not enjoy the vocal style, it's mellow and softer and if you're expecting over the top schenanigans, you're going to be disappointed. All instruments are very well done, musically and production wise. Excellent intro and great solo and surprising end.\u000a\u000a[MRW when the Nightwish upvotes were all for me](http://www.kappit.com/img/pics/26913163egffc.jpg)

aVSeventh Dimension stood out to me a bit as well, and having listened to more of the album it is worthwhile checking out if you enjoyed that song.
p7311
aVIt's on my checking list, the only aspect that terrifies me is the length, I think anyone agrees that an hour and 20 minutes is just too much for an album.
p7312
aVI listened to the whole thing in one sitting. I admit there were times songs seemed to blend together due to the length, but overall it kept my attention.\u000a\u000aI see what you're saying though. I'd prefer an album that's around 40 minutes and just filled to the brim with awesome moments in every song.

aV&gt; The symphonic (power) metal enthusiast in me was excited to check out Whyzdom and Lapis Lazuli, but I found both cases to be quite uninteresting, honestly.\u000a\u000aMaybe it's just me, but I'm tired of seemingly every female-fronted band with even a slight gothic theme making a track about the Salem Witch Trials. I did like the sound in general though, so hopefully the rest of their album will be interesting.\u000a\u000a&gt; For fans of folk metal with unclean vocals, Ensiferum seems to have pretty kick-ass instrumentation.\u000a\u000aI've been told over and over to listen to Ensiferum and that was the first time I heard them. I liked it, it will go well with Amon Amarth and Tyr. There's just so much music to keep up with and so little time!

p7318
aVOne can hope. Pure Steel Records is doing it, some it's likely that a CD release may happen.

aVWe should include the CD release whenever it comes out for these threads. I can see it now:\u000a\u000a"Exxplorer's Symphonies of Steel re-released on CD, go and bask in the glory!"
p7320
aVI have to agree with you this week isn't terribly exciting. I heard a few interesting songs here and there but the standout is easily the Exxplorer re-release. Telling that a thirty year old re-release I've heard before is the best release of the week, no? Too bad it's just an LP.

Those who are expected to be wise but act unwisely (government bodies or authority figures or whatnot) are "fallen from grace" through, if I understand it correctly, allowing financial gain to come before the preservation of our "paradise" i.e. earth.\u000a\u000aIt's cheesy, alright.

aVSo here's my list.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you're into something more proggy but still power check out [Anthriel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe4MMV7oQwE)\u000a\u000a\u000a[Ostura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaOdzCnmHiM) with plenty of vocalist is definitly something underrated and worth checking.\u000a\u000a\u000aSame goes for [Ascension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_tCoI4iRHk). If you're familiar with Sharky Sharky it's basically the same band but more serious.\u000a\u000a\u000a[Bane of Winterstorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDUht4jjEKw). One of the greatest band you'll ever hear in your life. I think.\u000a\u000a\u000a[Dynazty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty6WNPv5pu8). My best discovery of 2014 and definitely something unique and underrated.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you're into Running Wild, here's clone of this band which is (in my opinion) even better than them. [Blazon Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Llr_h4KITJc)\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you don't mind harsh vocals, here's my best album from 2014. [Crimson Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snI-FiyM7Dg)\u000a\u000a\u000aWell, I'm not a big fan of [Crosswind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b-7nqfE6qs) but this song is just sweet.\u000a\u000a\u000aI think you know this one, but anyway. [Dreamtale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlU1jaFcaQ)\u000a\u000a\u000a[Exlibris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd30lArQdaQ) just check out this violin solo here. INSANE!\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you're tired of every female metal fronted band, which sounds exactly the same, [Forgotten Tales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dd4-0gCYXY) is here to dry your tears. I love how she's not trying to sing more symphonic or so. Best power metal fronted band. You can actually fell the power here. 10/10\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you don't mind band being cheese, Power metal super hero band! How awesome is this? [Grailknights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cpEd7Z345E)\u000a\u000a\u000aI don't know if [Iron Mask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfayPYR2EM4) is underrated, but they definitely need more attention.\u000a\u000a\u000aYou ever heard of [Pathfinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbjCU-7hDJw)? I'm sure you did.\u000a\u000a\u000aYou like Freedom Call? You'll like [Ravenheart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIGRof8l1HE) even more.\u000a\u000a\u000aI've been waiting for this album more than one year, and when it came out, totally not disappointed. You can here something from Blind Guardian here, but don't let it fool you. This band is totally unreal. And this band is called [Stilverlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOy1X15X1ac)\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you're into Power Metal bands singing about love and stuff like this, [The Magnificent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh9pF6H9vN8) is great. (Sorry for linking full album, but i couldn't find anything on youtube with OK quality)\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you're in love with violin and again, don't mind some harsh vocals, [The Privateer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXVO4BCYXhg) is here to bring you some sweet melodies.\u000a\u000a\u000aif you don't mind religious bands, [Theocracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3KxF492fxQ).\u000a\u000a\u000aPower Neo-classical metal here. [Time Requiem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjGhOYZxIRI)\u000a\u000a\u000a[Wisdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFjVEXhWMgQ) is one of the most underrated power metal bands ever. Just listen to those high notes and excellent guitar/drums work. Masterpiece.\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd here's my recent discovery. [Merging Flare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsw3aJohnDE) released only one album, but it's the best one album band around here.\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd that's my list, I hope you enjoyed it.

aVThank you, sir!
p7403
aVSkylark, Beautiful Sin, Helstar, Dreamtale, and Angel Dust. 
p7404
aVBeautiful Sin was phenomenal, I really, really wish they'd throw together another album. One of the few female-fronted bands I *really* like.\u000a\u000aThat said - adding **Vandroya** to the discussion. In my opinion, they were the album of the year in 2013 and I still haven't spoken to many people that have heard of them.

aVHighland glory, Norwegian power metal band.
p7406
aVAltaria, Aquaria, Dragon Guardian, Skywings. There are a lot of bands out there I never see on this sub. 
p7407
aVLabyrinth(Italian melodic[English vocals]) and Orphaned Land(Israeli folk/death/progressive[Primary English vocals,  some Hebrew]) are two of my favorite bands that rarely appear on here. Orphaned maybe less so because they're not dedicated power metal,  but genres blend very easily in modern music\u000a
p7408
aVYou'd be hard-pressed to find anyone that listens to metal that hasn't heard of Orphaned Land. They've been around for 20 years and have quite a following. They're just not posted here because they're not power metal.
p7409
aVI would say that they have power metal songs,  and that they also have songs that fit into other genres.   They're very versatile,  particularly since returning with Mabool 
p7410
aVThey've got that one power metal-y song... All is One or something
p7411
aVHypersonic is an Italian female-fronted band that as far as I know only has one album but it's amazing. It has a good variety of music and it's not symphonic, just lighter power metal.
p7412
aVI was positively surprised by Orden Ogan when they opened for Hammerfall last time I saw them. I'd like to see more of those guys, folk / power metal.
p7413
aVSequester, Lifeform, Awe.some, Camlann, Cyberya, Illegal Operation, Epiclore, Waterland, Finist, Hannibal, The Lightbringer, My Material Season, Catharsis, Oceans of Night, Neutrino, Pegasus, Pesante, Kokumaromilk, Satanic a la mode, Scientic, Saluth o/o/o/, Spira, Tuatha du Danann and Cydonia are just a few off the top of my head

(lp7438
V*Song by Song Impressions*:\u000a\u000a\u000a**Ninth Wave:** This song contains the best album intro I have ever heard. Its epic in scope, but ominous. It doesn't just sound great - it does a fantastic job of setting up the atmosphere for the album and the story. As the additional elements come in, it feels like a twisted puzzle coming into place. Hansi + the layered vocals is just chilling. After the intro comes a rather unconventional song structure. The guitars and percussion maintains a strong backbone, but the vocal melodies feel like they're in some sort of soup, being pulled out as needed. It all continues the dark tone set up by the intro - and then 'LET THIS FIRE BURN!' followed by a wonderful, if rather standard Blind Guardian chorus. All of this combined with some new instrumentation for the band took a couple listens to fully take in, but I think the band managed to make something both a pleasure to listen to as well as being entirely unique. \u000a\u000a**Twilight of the Gods:** It was our song of the year for 2014, and well deserved imo. This is one of the more standard Blind Guardian tracks on the album, but it nevertheless still brings something new to the table. It starts off with a very speed/power metal-esque intro, reminiscent of the band's Somewhere Far Beyond album, then Hansi comes in screaming as the band kicks into the main riffs for the song. While being much more traditional in song structure compared to much of the album, the band still plays around a bit with the verse-chorus structure and the pre-chorus intro/outro sections are powerful additions to this song.\u000a\u000a**Prophecies:** 'How much was the band listening to Uriah Heep while writing this album?' is a question I find myself often asking when listening to this album, and this song is a fine example of this. The band talked about this one being left over from the writing for At the Edge of Time, and I can definitely hear a sense of 'Control the Divine' in it as well. Apart from the influences, I have to say I really enjoy the layered vocals on this one - more than usual! This is also the first of two songs that feel like they're building up to something, and then end with a magnificent conclusion!\u000a\u000a**At The Edge of Time:** Oh my. This is the symphonic masterpiece of the album, as well as being the second of the two songs to primarily be built around the climb up to an explosive conclusion. First things first, the percussion is a little too basic on this song for my liking - I get the sense that the band want the timing, and then for the drums to allow everything else to shine. And gods does everything else shine. The two symphonic songs on the last album (also titled 'At the Edge of Time!') showed a level of mastery in integrating the metal band with the classical orchestras and choirs that few such bands have achieved, and Blind Guardian has upped their game. The band and the orchestra take turns to shine, but more importantly have more frequent interaction that complements both equally, and the more subtle elements of the orchestra are taken advantage of as much as the bombastic. Hansi takes the opportunity to try a more operatic approach to his vocals, though not extremely so, and all this combines into an excellent whole. The conclusion of the song is easily among the album's best moments.\u000a\u000a**Ashes of Eternity:** Thus far, this has proven to be my favorite song on the album. It is another more traditional song structure-wise, but also continues to experiment with vocal melodies and Hansi's own style, which has some unique combination of 'fullness' and 'harshness' that's not quite like anything else he's done. The backing vocals really shine on this song, and Hansi does a great job of integrating them with his own main melodies. I haven't talked about solos yet, but I think André's performance here is worth a highlight, though the riffing throughout the song is really the standout aspect of the guitars. Once again, Uriah Heep influence deserve a mention. Also that 'Caesar!' ...holy shit.\u000a\u000a**Distant Memories:** This song has quite a unique intro for the band, but the orchestration is the real star of this ballad. It continues to demonstrate the excellent integration between the band and the symphony that the songwriting has achieved. Hansi takes a soothing and soaring approach which works very well with the song. The melody following the solo is the high point of this song for me - it's quite a powerful bit amidst a more gentle song.\u000a\u000a**The Holy Grail:** Here's how I described it when this song leaked: "It's everything I want in my power metal cereal: aggressive, intricate, catchy, new sounds, and Hansi...!" This is basically classic speed metal Guardian combined with some influence from their newer, more progressive approach. The result is a song with both aggressive catchiness and songwriting depth. The chorus on this one is probably my favorite of the album - I could see this one being a crowd favorite, for sure. \u000a\u000a**The Throne:** This one might be described as 'At the Edge of Time' combined with a more traditional structure. The strings take more of a leading role for the orchestration, though the brass section coming in strong around 'We will not surrender' is another very powerful moment on the album. Like 'At the Edge of Time,' Hansi takes a more operatic approach, and this song feels like the one where the story of the album plays in the strongest, especially regarding its combination with the music. All in all, it's a very dramatic song, and every element makes the most of that.\u000a\u000a**Sacred Mind:** This is easily the harshest song on the album. Pounding drums and aggressive riffs do a lot - but Hansi's killer vocal performance is really the star of this song. The bridge between the intro and the song proper, along with the conclusion of the song, are great examples of this. Once the song gets going, it maintains a high level of energy, helped out by a rather catchy chorus.\u000a\u000a**Miracle Machine:** A short and sweet ballad. Hansi talked about wanting something calm before the big epic, and the song accomplishes that well. I'd describe it as 'The Eldar' redone with some Demons &amp; Wizards vocals and strings. It's a safer song for the band, but it has a nice touch.\u000a\u000a**Grand Parade:** Here it is - the big finisher! What a song this is - it's like a sinusoid of orchestral metal, constantly oscillating between loud and soft moments. It brings everything the band has, and Hansi especially has a lot cut out for him on this one. He brings his ballad voice, the big choruses, as well as some harsher moments. The tone of the song is an uplifting song unlike anything the band has done before. A good ways into the song, it starts building up - more like the latter part of The Throne than like Ashes of Eternity - and some nice brass touches complement Hansi's vocal lines excellently. The chorus of the song is one of the strongest on the album.\u000a\u000a**Doom:** What's this - more?! If you got the Earbook edition, yes! This is easily the most experimental song on a rather experimental album. You could also exchange 'experimental' for 'dark' there. Hansi and the guitars sound absolutely evil on this one - it reminds me quite a bit of 'Dead Sound of Misery.' The catchiness of the song suffers a bit as a result, and it's probably the weakest of the bunch. Nevertheless, the song has its excellent moments too.\u000a
p7439
aV(Continued from above due to word limit)\u000a\u000a*Story:* With the songs not being terribly explicit regarding the narrative, and not much expository material included (the Earbook has a bit more), the story is definitely one that's open to a quite a bit of interpretation. Here's my understanding of it, though: there were once two realms: ours and a fantastical realm called Camlann. Camlann, also known as the 'Promised Land,' was ruled by nine beings referred to as gods, though they were mortals. Some of these were the Crow, Hare, Fox, Bear, and Falcon. There are other divine beings such as Time, Space, Fire, Fear, and Void. Mordred, the Fallen One, is the son of one of these beings. Mordred wages war on the Nine, which causes them to reach out to our world. A boy named Arthur, who shares the same name as the Bear, encounters a mirror which is a bridge to this other realm where he is the Chosen One. He is meant to leap through, but instead declines. This causes magic to leak out of Camlann into our world, where a scientist named Harry Oppenheimer discovers how to use it. Within two decades, technocrats forge one world government with one religion, and begin reviving mystical creatures. Time travel is used to manipulate historical events. Mordred continues his quest to wipe out the gods who soon depart or disappear from Camlann, renamed Discordia. The story of the album occurs as Arthur learns of Mordred's attack, and he is called to Discordia. He must pass through the only remaining gateway: the Red Mirror. However, he is killed, and only saved by Mother Time. He is led to the Holy Grail, which is a key in defeating Mordred. War is waged on Mordred, who still believes his aim is pure, and Arthur is tempted to give up his quest. Finally, in the end, the gods are made powerless, and Arthur and Mordred are trapped outside both realms. The two worlds are both still in a state of chaos, but have been left to recover on their own, and all the gateways between them are sealed. This could largely be wrong, though, given the ambiguity of the material.\u000a\u000a*Production:* This has received a lot of criticism, and I hate to say it, but it's very well deserved criticism. Frankly, Blind Guardian probably has among the worst engineering for a band with their resources, which is unfortunate given how good the songwriting is. The orchestral tracks suffered the worst - the symphonies often sound distorted and muted, and that sometimes even affects the guitars. The cymbals are often too loud in the mix - they seem to even be at the forefront of 'At the Edge of Time,' to the point of making it difficult to fully enjoy all the intricate orchestration going on. A few notable audio glitches also sneaked in - the worst is on 'The Throne.' It's frankly surprising that something as bad as that one got in the final mix. Some of the songs do sound good though - to the point that it can feel like there were very different engineering teams working on a few of these. All in all though, this is almost a return to A Twist in the Myth's level of bad production.\u000a\u000aOverview: Production aside, this is a stellar, though not flawless, album. Ultimately, I see this album as continuing band's march into more progressive songwriting, and even more so mastering the band's integration with symphonic elements. I feel that this plays the role of 'rock opera' much better than Nightfall in Middle-earth, which does not have as strong of a self-contained narrative. While the story can be difficult to decipher, I do feel that it contributes positively to the songwriting and the emotional depth of the music. Hansi sounds great as usual on this album, and I don't think there's a Blind Guardian album where he has quite as much variance in style from song-to-song.
p7440
aVIt really is unfortunate about the production, especially with the drumming. Like, listen to the chorus of The Holy Grail....it almost sounds like Frederik isn't even playing the bass drums and is just hitting the cymbal. I agree the album is still great but it's almost unacceptable for a record in 2015 to sound like this.
p7441
aVY'know, people talk about The Holy Grail being a great song, and I just... don't care for it.  Excluding Doom, I believe it to easily be the weakest song.
p7442
aV*Even with that beautiful chorus?!*\u000a\u000aNah, just kidding... sort of.\u000a\u000aIf the song doesn't appeal to you, that's just the way it is. This is especially true in a more energy-driven song like The Holy Grail, where if that energy isn't there for you, there's not going to be much else than can appeal to you.
p7443
aVI can definitely do energy driven, I just find the melody structure of The Holy Grail not appealing to me, especially compared to the catchiness and intricacy of the rest of the album.

aVMy first listen through had me thinking, "oh boy, this is not living up to hype...".\u000a\u000aMy second listen through had me thinking, "hmm, this is pretty good actually, I can get into this - lots of little things to pick up here and there, and quite a lot going on".\u000a\u000aMy third listen through, "damn, this album is amazing, definitely got into this - the only stopping this album from being perfect is the production!".\u000a\u000aFavorite songs are Ninth Wave, Twilight of the Gods, Distant Memories, and The Throne.  I love the others, but I figure listing the majority of songs as favorites is a little strange.\u000a\u000aNinth Wave has the best intro I have ever heard, and the parts where Hansi does aggressive, quick-shouting vocals (especially the second, longer one) are absolutely amazing.\u000a\u000aTwilight of the Gods has some of the catchiest vocal melodies going on that I have heard in awhile.  The more I listen to the chorus, the more I understand what Blind Guardian meant about how catchy it is.  I love that about this album - instead of the more you listen to it, the more boring and old it gets; it is the more you listen to it, the more interesting and catchy it gets.\u000a\u000aDistant Memories is a song that requires the listener to pay very close attention.  It is an incredibly intricate song in a very subtle way - and by Jesus, that chorus is magical.\u000a\u000aThe Throne?  All you need is "I've come to tell 'yaaaaaa once more!",  mmf.\u000a\u000aAs I continue to listen, I am sure my favorites will change.  I have not been able to get into The Holy Grail (especially this one) and Grand Parade as much as the next person.\u000a\u000aIn regards to future official album discussions, the only thing I'd suggest is reminding people to sort comments via new to continue discussion and keep it moving forward.

aVI got scared on my first listen because the album starts out with one of the most boring songs BG have ever written, which is a shame, because it starts off with a really cool intro and then just plods on for 7 minutes. Thankfully after that it returns to the standard BG fair.  \u000a\u000aFor me this is a run of the mill BG album(which is still pretty damn good) but for me, its a step down from the last album and isn't close to 90's Guardian.  I'm assuming the people saying this is the best BG album or that "they never really got BG until this album" haven't experienced a Blind Guardian release before and just got caught up in the hype.  \u000a\u000aThe three standout tracks for me are At the Edge of Time, Grand Parade and The Holy Grail.   
p7452
aV&gt;  I'm assuming the people saying this is the best BG album or that "they never really got BG until this album" haven't experienced a Blind Guardian release before and just got caught up in the hype. \u000a\u000aI don't think that's fair. There's nothing else quite like it in Blind Guardian's discography, and not everyone shares your tastes. For one thing, one of my friends says that this is the first time they can appreciate Hansi's vocals for certain songs.
p7453
aVI think this album is amazing and easily one of the better works coming out from Blind Guardian. Yes, the production is a bit flat. Yes, it's a bit too long. However, thematically and musically I think this is full of great ideas and nearly all of them are executed properly and harmoniously.\u000a\u000aIf you want my honest opinion, the weaker tracks are the opener and the closer. All the parts that compose The Ninth Wave are actually very good if you individualize each of them but, together... I think they aren't very well glued together and suffers in the long run, same thing for The Grand Parade, goes great for the 5 or 6 initial minutes but then the final part (again, very well done), just doesn't really merge well with the other part of the song.\u000a\u000aAll in all, This is easily one of the better albums in 2015 already. I'm just sad it's not a return to the Blind Guardian's formula of speed metal.
p7454
aV&gt; I'm just sad it's not a return to the Blind Guardian's formula of speed metal.\u000a\u000aThere are a couple fairly speedy tracks on it, though (The Holy Grail and Sacred Mind). If you're looking for something like late 80s or early 90s Guardian, I think it just needs to be accepted that that isn't going to happen. The band has evolved, and they aren't interested in just writing another speed metal album.
p7455
aVI fully acknowledge they won't ever release an album akin to their early work. I only wanted more speed and less pompous stuff.\u000a\u000aHonestly, if there ever was a band that had to evolve into a more symphonic style, I'm glad it was Blind Guardian because they do have the chops to pull off grandiose orchestrated metal.
p7456
aVThis is the sound they've been developing since A Night at the Opera...So...is Beyond the Red Mirror a good album? Absolutely.  Is it a great album? Maybe.  I'd rate it near equal or maybe above At the Edge of Time.  \u000a  \u000aThe good: High quality symphonic elements, typical excellent intros, great vocals from hansi\u000a  \u000aThe bad: iffy production, a little too heavy on slow meandering segments, needs more riffs, not every song ever needs 80 layers of vocals\u000a  \u000a\u000a\u000aHeavy on the symphonic elements, many of the songs on Beyond the Red Mirror tend to meander rather than follow the formula that made Blind Guardian so famous.  Hooks, melodies and choruses that are second to none.  It's no surprise that Holy Grail is so highly regarded because it is by far the tightest song on the album (and IMO it's a song destined to become a fan favorite at concerts).  \u000a  \u000a  \u000a  \u000aTrack highlights:\u000a\u000aNinth Wave - The only non-classic Track One they've ever released.  Possibly my least favorite song on the album.  \u000a  \u000aTwilight of the Gods - This track goes all over the place but it's grown on me.  I don't know why they bothered releasing it as the single since it's not especially catchy.  A 7/10 if I've ever heard one.  \u000a  \u000aAt the Edge of Time - The first track on the album that really sold me on the album that Blind Guardian still has it.  \u000a  \u000aHoly Grail - If they released an album of Holy Grails people would probably consider Blind Guardian the best power metal band of all time.  Oh wait, they've done that.  Classic BG fare.\u000a\u000aSacred Mind - My wife's favorite song from the album.  Catchy chorus and not too long winded.\u000a  \u000aMiracle Machine - This albums' Black Chamber/The Eldar that is a bit odd and only 8 people will actually enjoy it.  Hansi almost sounds like he isn't up to the task of singing the song, it's very jarring since for the rest of the album, he's still got it.  \u000a  \u000aThe Grand Parade - Ninth Wave hears this song and goes and cowers in the corner or something.\u000a  \u000a  \u000a\u000a
p7457
aV&gt;I don't know why they bothered releasing it as the single since it's not especially catchy. \u000a\u000aPlenty of people do think it's quite catchy, though...
p7458
aVSpeaking generally and briefly:\u000a\u000a* The band seemed to get its teeth stuck into orchestration with At The Edge of Time and this album feels like they're indulging in another hit (so if you came because you love some speed metal you're going to be left underfed). It feels like a continuation of that and while very impressive for the most part I get the feeling it doesn't quite live up to the symphonic compositions of the previous album.\u000a* I genuinely think Hansi sounds better on this album. It's a feature of his unique vocals that he can use a hoarse-screeching sound (see Wheel of Time) characteristic of his earlier work which seems downplayed on this album in favour of a fuller voice, confident in hitting the higher range consistently and cleanly.\u000a* It's a concept album which means it's less schizophrenic in themes than the last album and while I think this means it suffers a tiny bit in lack of experimentation I do think each track gives enough variety that a listen-through doesn't blur into one.\u000a* I can't comment much on narrative but I love that Sacred Mind references Kubla Khan by Coleridge.\u000a* The token ballad, Miracle Machine, is beautiful.\u000a* The grand finale is epic but for my money does not unseat Wheel of Time or And Then There Was Silence but it is, on its own merits, magnificent nonetheless. \u000a* I don't really understand the criticism on production. While something does seem lacking in comparison I don't think it's awful and neither do I find it distracting enough to warrant mention. But \u005c*shrug* I'm no audiophile and I don't have the best, most expensive setup. 
p7459
aV&gt; I can't comment much on narrative but I love that Sacred Mind references Kubla Khan by Coleridge.\u000a\u000aThere are a lot of great references on this album. The Arthuring Cycle gets a lot of mentions (Arthur, Mordred, Camlann, the Holy Grail, etc.) Greek and Norse mythology also come into it, and there's even a lot of connections to Blind Guardian's discography, particularly Imaginations from the Other Side, A Night at the Opera, and A Twist in the Myth.
p7460
aVOverall, I thoroughly enjoy this album, although it took a few listens to get into it.\u000a\u000aTrack overviews:\u000a\u000aThe Ninth Wave:\u000aThis was my least favourite song when I first listened to it, since the instrumentation and vocals outside of the chorus seem muddled and hard to piece together. Now I've taken some time to listen to it more carefully, I have a much better appreciation for it.\u000aThe orchestration seems very strong on this track, especially the epic choirs in the first and last few minutes of the track.\u000aHighlights of this track are the suitably epic intro and outro, the nice strong chorus and the amazing first verse - I especially enjoy the slower, darker section beginning at 2:29.\u000a\u000aTwilight of the Gods:\u000aFirst song I heard on the album, I thoroughly enjoy the whole thing, and there isn't much for me to say that hasn't been said already. Great song all round.\u000aThe chorus is good, and I enjoy the riff that comes after the chorus a lot.\u000a\u000aProphecies:\u000aThis seems a very solid track, a little softer than the previous two in my opinion. I haven't listened to it as much as I would like yet, but one thing that does stand out is the superb chorus.\u000a\u000aAt the Edge of Time:\u000aProbably my favourite track on the album, I enjoy every element of this track, although at times the orchestration seems to drown out the percussion and guitars (noticeably in the chorus).\u000aHaving said that, the orchestration is very good (I especially like the short but atmospheric intro with the bells).\u000aThis track seems to simply build up and up continuously, releasing more epic melodies ("grant me wings to fly...") and slowly building up the heaviness of the rhythm guitars and percussion until a slight release in tension just before the chorus, then exploding into one of the most epic choruses on the album, accompanied by some brilliant brass.\u000aHighlights are the build-up to the first chorus, the chorus, and the various orchestration throughout the track.\u000a\u000aAshes of Eternity:\u000aThe song I've listened to the least on the album so far, there seems to be a lot of good things here though, but nothing truly amazing. I'm do like,however, how the faster thrash/speed metal kinda sound of the intro/verse works well in contrast to the slower and lighter chorus.\u000a\u000aDistant Memories:\u000aBeen listening to this a lot recently, one of my favourites. I love the intro, especially how some of the melodies work with the percussion. The chorus is one of the strongest on the album I feel, one of my favourite BG ones overall.\u000a\u000aHoly Grail:\u000aLess orchestration here, and a much heavier sound. I much prefer the guitars on this track to Ashes of Eternity, although the vocals in the chorus can be quite lackluster at times (save for the woahs and the bit directly before the chorus). The chorus itself, however, like Distant memories, is one of the best on the album. Great stuff.\u000a\u000aThe Throne:\u000aWill give this a few more listens at some point. I enjoy this track, it has a very strong chorus (Determination... Determination... Determination!) and the verse is also quite epic and dramatic, but not as much as the first verse of either The Ninth Wave or At The Edge of Time. The variation in the verses seems to be quite refreshing though (the second verse especially is slower at the start and very good).\u000a\u000aSacred Mind:\u000aThis track is another one of my favourites. The instrumentation is heavier in the intro and later, yet it contrasts with softer and more mournful vocals from Hansi at the start of the verse, but is then reinforced by stronger and harsher vocals in the second half. Overall, good guitar work, and the Chorus is very good, the layered vocals work well here.\u000a\u000aMiracle Machine:\u000aThe ballad is good, great chorus, shame it is so short!\u000a\u000aGrand Parade:\u000aI haven't listened to this much yet, so won't comment in full yet, but the chorus seems very good - and very lengthy!\u000a\u000aDoom:\u000aMinimal listens, will add more later.\u000a\u000a\u000aOverall:\u000aI haven't been bothered by the production. I feel this is a very strong album, but also very different. It has a quite unique feel.\u000a\u000aWill add a post about my interpretations of the lyrics at a later date.
p7461
aVThis is one of the few albums I listened to repeatedly when it came out (four times in a week, which is unheard of for me). And yeah, it needed multiple listens to fully take in what was there.\u000a\u000aThis is solely because on my **first listen**, it felt thick as mud, and that's exactly why I DON'T like A Night At the Opera. (you can argue me later on that fact, just not here, stick to the topic). But as always, it had catchy choruses and some great hooks. Somethings I caught on first listen was the Kubla Khan reference, but I know it better as Xanadu by Rush (having heard that album no more than a month ago). I also felt that The Ninth Wave was Sacred Worlds mach 2. Much like how Black Sabbath's albums Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules had similar songs (Neon Knights/Turn Up the Night, Heaven and Hell/Sign of the Southern Cross) this is how I felt about Ninth Wave. Not a bad thing at all, I like when it sounds similar, yet different.\u000a\u000a**Second listen**, the album was a new experience. The songs started sounding much different and had their own sound. I know what Holy Grail sounds like compared to Sacred Minds, along with Ninth Wave to Grand Parade. (still can't get over how Distant Memories starts, feels like a B-Side with its intro) I even started digging the story that there's only one mirror left (the Red one if you can believe that...) and how it needs to be found. And good news, it didn't sound like it was as thick as mud this time, which is always a plus.\u000a\u000aThe **third listen** worried me, because I told my friends "this needs to be listened to" and it was their first time hearing it. Sadly, to them it was "it's good, I'll check it out" compared to the "Holy Shit! This kicked me in the dickhole!" response I was hoping for (yes, my circle of friends do actually say that)\u000a\u000a**Fourth listen** was probably a little less enjoyable, since I knew everything that was coming, but it still felt like an enjoyable listen. As for all these "production is iffy" comments, I have it at 320 kbps and through nice headphones, so it sounded awesome to me (minus the third time which was just played through the ipod)\u000a\u000aMy biggest problem though is where do I rank it on my list of Blind Guardian albums? My list looks different from most because I enjoy the speedy Guardian stuff as much as the later material. But overall, this was **4th** (out of 10) on my list of best to worst BG albums.\u000a\u000a**Best Songs:** Sacred Minds, Miracle Machine, Twilight of the Gods, At the Edge of Time\u000a\u000a**Overall Rating:** 4.5/5. This is because I gave it multiple listens. It would have been a 3.5 or a 4 otherwise.\u000a\u000a**Sidenote:** Has anyone listened to the bonus track Doom? Is it worthwhile or skippable? I ask because I got the Digi-Pak and didn't feel the need to spend more on an extra track.
p7462
aV&gt;As for all these "production is iffy" comments, I have it at 320 kbps and through nice headphones, so it sounded awesome to me (minus the third time which was just played through the ipod)\u000a\u000aListening on CD quality and on a variety of platforms: low quality speakers, high quality speakers, low quality headphones, and high quality headphones. The production isn't good.\u000a\u000a&gt;Has anyone listened to the bonus track Doom? Is it worthwhile or skippable?\u000a\u000aIt's an experimental track for the band that doesn't quite work out well, similar to 'Dead Sound of Misery'. It's the weakest of the songs. If you don't need to hear everything the band comes out with, I'd say it's skippable.
p7463
aVI like Dead Sound of Misery :(
p7464
aVI must be the only one who didn't care for the production then. I've heard much worse and this album was far from the worst.
p7465
aVIt's more like we should expect better from Blind Guardian of all bands.  They very obviously care about their craft and have the resources and connections to record an album with no production issues.  Somewhere Far Beyond might sound like it was recorded in a cave on a tape recorder, but at least it was consistent across the board; Beyond the Red Mirror is all over the place.
p7466
aVAfter a few listens I've begun to really enjoy this album. However the production is terrible, and has definitely made it harder to appreciate it. Vocals are fine, but the guitars and drums are very poorly mixed.so far my favourite song is the holy grail, which is probably one of the songs that suffers the least from the production issues. Despite this,it's still probably my favourite Blind Guardian album since Nightfall
p7467
aVI agree that the production could be better, but it's definitely not terrible.  You **need** to listen to this on big speakers that can can really let loose and build the proper sound stage for you. \u000a\u000aThere is just so much layering that if you try to listen to this album on small speakers, like headphones or even most car stereos, you won't come anywhere close to the sound that Blind Guardian intended. 
p7468
aVIf anything, listening to music on an excellent pair of headphones is one of the BEST ways to experience music. This album falls a little flat at times, unfortunately.
p7469
aVThat's not really a convincing argument, because even if it's true, most people  aren't to be able to do that, so the production is going to be a problem for them. An album should sound good on headphones, if it doesn't that's an issue
p7470
aVYou can't make a song sound perfect on tiny speakers **and** big speakers. They're just too vastly different. When it comes to fine-tuning an exact sound, a band has to bear in mind what their music is going to be played on. And a grand sound like Blind Guardian's -  I think they made the right choice. 
p7471
aVBullshit. Small flat response speakers/drivers and large flat response speakers have largely the same response. You know. Flat. \u000a\u000aNow obviously there is going to be some difference, particularly in how the bass responds. But a mix that sounds bad through reasonable quality flat response headphones, 99% of the time, is a bad mix.
p7472
aVI've listened to the album on low quality speakers, high quality speakers, low quality headphones, and high quality headphones. Speakers and headphones don't really make a difference in my experience, aside from speakers better masking the audio glitches. If a mix is done badly, that's going to be reflected in all mediums.
p7473
aVI am not going to pretend like I understand how this shit works, however listening to things on high quality speakers or headphones is obviously better, and this is VERY apparent on this album.  Things will become muddled quickly with shitty audio.
p7474
aVstill muddled with quality headphones though\u000a\u000aedit: forgot how to english
p7475
aVThat techno percussion on Ninth Wave is really weird. Miracle Machine is quite the tearjerker. Grand Parade is an epic ending. I keep getting little snippets of melody stuck in my head hours later.
p7476
aVStill trying to digest this album.  I get the feeling this is the sound they were aiming for with A Twist in the Myth.  I'm liking it more and more each time I hear it.  \u000a\u000aMy favorite track is Holy Grail - Very accessible, and it covers all of the various styles of BG through the years.\u000a\u000aLeast favorite right now is Miracle Machine.  It is a very nice ballad, but it seems lacking to me.  I kept waiting for the song to kick into a heavier gear for a little bit, but it never happened.
p7477
aVI had a very similar feeling when I first listened - I felt it would have been pretty great had some guitars kicked in around halfway through and we got a heavier chorus second time round, but I must say I still enjoy it as it is.\u000a\u000aThe chorus is indeed very good after all. 
p7478
aVAt the Edge of Time and Sacred Mind are my two favorites!
p7479
aVI'm a bit late here, but:\u000a\u000aI went into this album with a closed mind. I'm not the biggest fan of their work after Imaginations, but I figured this will be a reliable release with at least a few good tracks.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say, I was really blown away. On first listen, I had no idea what was going on. The verses on this album are incredibly progressive, and each song feels like a huge journey. After more listens, the structures of the songs became clearer, and it was easy to pick out favourites. The Ninth Wave is probably the best song here because it's chorus is incredibly catchy. With that said, I actually find Twilight of the Gods to be stuck in my head most often.\u000a\u000aProphecies is the song I feel like nobody is talking about, but it is easily one of the best. In fact, this song probably has my favourite performance of Hansi's on the record.\u000a\u000aI don't enjoy the next two tracks as much. They feel more symphonic (which is fine), but they just aren't catchy. Luckily, The Holy Grail immediately redeems those two. Same thing with the two tracks after.\u000a\u000aMiracle Machine is a pretty good ballad. I feel like its placement is perfect on the album, and that makes it more effective. Grand Parade is pretty much the definition of epic and an appropriate conclusion to the album.\u000a\u000aOverall, I was really impressed and will be returning to this often. I can't tell what's coming for the rest of the year, but this is a serious contender to be my top album of the year.
p7480
aV&gt; I don't enjoy the next two tracks as much. They feel more symphonic (which is fine), but they just aren't catchy.\u000a\u000aAre you overlooking Ashes of Eternity there?

VSo I'm quite a fan of Versailles, and Jupiter is basically Versailles with a different singer. It took me a while to get into their previous album, the new singer just isn't as good and it took some getting used to, but after getting past that, it was a seriously solid album. Their new album is coming out in January and I'm seriously looking forward to it. 
p7485
aVi feel the same, hope someday they reband again

p7511
aVYeah he sounds better in this, I still think his voice is EQ'd wrong in the mix somehow. It sounds too trebly, ends up cutting too much making it sound like hes singing over the song rather than with the song.

aVThe order the playlist is in. \u000a\u000a**Caleb** - the "prequel"; Caleb's upbringing\u000a\u000a**The End Of This Chapter** - Caleb stalks a girl\u000a\u000a**Don't Say A Word** - Caleb catches the girl\u000a\u000a**Juliet** - Caleb dies - (how/why up to interpretation...)\u000a\u000aThat's the basic gist, hope it helps you start to make sense of the story!
p7532
aVWoah this is very interesting! Thanks for submitting this!\u000a\u000aI really think End of This chapter is such a powerful song. Even though the topic of stalking is not something a lot can relate to, the feeling the 'stalker' feels makes you have so much empathy. You can feel the pain and the suffering the stalker feels. Very interesting and very bold to make a song about this. \u000a\u000aFor the rest of the songs, I think with your explanation on the subject I think I should take more time to read and understand the lyrics.

VMy favourite song from the best Running Wild album since 1998!
p7538
asVSonata Arctica- Ain't Your Fairytale [5:26] (One of my absolute favorites)
p7539
(lp7540
VI remember when I got *Reckoning Night*. I preordered from the Sonata Arctica website and got it all in a pretty package and didn't listen to anything beforehand because SA was my favorite band and I wanted to experience it like it was something important. I think I got it a few days before it was "officially" released and I was sooooo disappointed by the first two tracks.\u000a\u000aThen this came on. \u000a\u000aI still think *Ain't Your Fairytale* is one of Sonata Arctica's five best songs. 
p7541
aVDamn, how can you be disappointed by Misplaced and Blinded No More? Genuinely curious.
p7542
aVThere's just something *missing* in those songs. I personally think *Blinded No More* is particularly horrible and *Misplaced* is far and away the worst album opener ever.\u000a\u000aThose are pretty much the only two bad songs on that album though. I was never really a fan of *Wildfire* when it first came out, but listening to it more recently I think I just overlooked it. The first two still aren't impressive; I'm so glad they were smart enough to cut it out of their setlists after the *Reckoning Night* tour.
p7543
aVMisplaced is a great song.  And it's definitely better than Everything Fades to Gray/Deathaura
p7544
aV:-O *Deathaura* is *amazing*. Easily the best track on TDoG. Like. . .not even close.\u000a\u000aEDIT: *Zeroes* is pretty solid.
p7545
aVI prefer the last amazing grays over deathaura.  Misplaced evokes similar feelings to Abandoned Pleased Brainwashed Exploited.  Pumps me up and gets me ready to listen to the album.

p7590
aVPretty good picks. Out of those I'd probably put "Elan" and "The Boy who Wanted to be a Real Puppet" closest to "Score to a New Beginning". But the scope of the theme would naturally be up for discussion
p7591
aVSo basically... like a youtube themed playlist?
p7592
aVEssentially, yes. Just in one video, rather than multiple.
p7593
aVI honestly hate playlists, I pretty much only listen to entire albums so I think I'm gonna stay clear of this one. I'm trying to find something like what you mentioned but I can't really see anything, mainly because I fail to see how Score to a New Beginning fits the "serene" description, it's more epic than anything else imo.

aVI am not ashamed to admit that I was actually looking forward to reading about how your musical taste is superior to my own. No joke, I find that kind of thing interesting.
p7648
aVOkay, let's do it. Let's report as best as possible the facts and circumstances surrounding your music taste's sick analects. Just so you know, I plan to spend a good deal of this post discussing your music taste and its overweening wisecracks. I also plan to say a bit about how to avoid producing another generation of prejudice and inequity we must overcome the obstacles that people like your music taste establish, but I'll save that part for the end.\u000a\u000aNations that tolerate denying minorities a cultural voice will perish certainly and perish forever. Let me explain. To understand your music taste's motives, I feel that we must examine the deep culture of your music taste's cabal\u2014its key psychosocial traits, good and bad. If we do so, I predict we'll discover that your music taste keeps missing my point. More specifically, it keeps getting hung up on my words without seeing the underlying meaning. For example, when I say that I must unmistakably add my voice to the chorus of those who transcend traditional thinking, your music taste seems incapable of realizing that what I'm really getting at is that it's exceedingly irritating, psychotic, morally repugnant, malign, inarticulate, sleazy, obtrusive, voluble, ungrateful, and conscienceless. Sorry for the synathroesmus, but your music taste's plan is to delude and often rob those rendered vulnerable and susceptible to its snares because of poverty, illness, or ignorance. Your music taste's adulators are moving at a frightening pace toward the total implementation of that agenda, which includes causing this country to flounder on the shoals of self-interest, corruption, and chaos.\u000a\u000aThe important point here is not that to the fullest extent that my age and health will permit, I, not being one of the many lackluster scandalmongers of this world, will expand people's understanding of your music taste's complacent tractates. The vital matter is that I can easily see your music taste performing the following raving acts. First, it will skewer me over a pit barbecue. Then, it will lead us, lemminglike, over the precipice of self-destruction. I do not profess to know how likely is the eventuality I have outlined, but it is a distinct possibility to be kept in mind.\u000a\u000aYour music taste's wheelings and dealings manifest themselves in two phases. Phase one: make widespread accusations and insinuations without having the facts to back them up. Phase two: sully my reputation. Some people have said that conversations with your music taste are no more intellectual than a game of darts at the local pub. Maybe. But I'm more inclined to believe that your music taste feels that it can convince criminals to fill out an application form before committing a crime. Go home, your music taste; you're drunk. Any sober person would realize that to someone whose eyes are open, your music taste's constantly repeated mantra that criminals are merely social rebels is an insanely self-serving notion. By way of contrast, consider my personal mantra that a bunch of profoundly logorrheic thickheads have recently been accused of silencing anyone whom your music taste considers inhumane. Your music taste's fingerprints are all over that operation. Even if it turns out that it is not ultimately responsible for instigating it, the sheer amount of its involvement demands answers. For instance, how can we break your music taste's hypnotic spell over irascible schmoes? It's an interesting question, and its examination will help us understand how your music taste's policies work. Let me start by providing evidence that you shouldn't let your music taste intimidate you. You shouldn't let it push you around. We're the ones who are right, not your music taste.\u000a\u000aYour music taste has a strategy. Its strategy is to frog-march its opponents into the nearest detention center or internment camp. Wherever you encounter that strategy, you are dealing with your music taste.\u000a\u000aYour music taste decries or dismisses capitalism, technology, industrialization, and systems of government borne of Enlightenment ideas about the dignity and freedom of human beings. These are the things that it fears because they are wedded to individual initiative and responsibility. Here's some news for people who are surprised by sunrise: Your music taste ought to unstop its ears and uncover its eyes. Only then will it hear that to which it has been too long heedless. Only then will your music taste see that you should be able to live your life the way you want to live it. You shouldn't have to live in fear of your music taste doing the entire country a grave disservice.\u000a\u000aYour music taste is addicted to the feeling of power, to the idea of controlling people. Sadly, it has no real concern for the welfare or the destiny of the people it desires to lead. As will become apparent by the end of the decade, despite your music taste's self-image as the primary civilizing force of modern times, it seems clear that one often finds your music taste in the company of sinful deadbeats or other unsavory characters. But we ought to look at the matter in a broader framework before we draw final conclusions on the subject: We see that if it weren't for your music taste's double standards it would have no standards at all. Hence, it's entirely a waste of time even to address your music taste's hypocrisy. That's why I'll state merely that I would like to believe that it acts with our interests in mind. I really would. But your music taste sure makes it difficult to believe such things. For instance, it avouches that clever one-liners are a valid substitute for actual thinking. As you can no doubt determine from comments like that, facts and your music taste are like oil and water.\u000a\u000aJust as night follows day, your music taste will lobotomize everyone caught thinking an independent thought in the blink of an eye. Viewing all this from a higher vantage point, we can see that concrete examples abound of ways to strengthen our roots so we can weather the storms that threaten our foundation. For instance, consider that your music taste claims that the betterment of society depends upon its spoon-feeding us its pabulum. I have my told-you-so's primed and ready to go as soon as people start noticing that by letting your music taste do something as uninformed as that, we are forgetting that if we fail to hammer out solutions on the anvil of discourse then all of our sacrifices will be as forgotten as the sand blowing across Ozymandias's dead empire. The \u201cdecay of that colossal wreck,\u201d as the poet Shelley puts it, teaches us that some people apparently believe that if we don't bother your music taste, your music taste won't bother us. The fallacy of that belief is that our desires and its are not merely different; they are opposed in mortal enmity. Your music taste wants to treat anyone who doesn't agree with it to a torrent of vitriol and vilification. We, in contrast, want to alert people that its brand of statism focuses on granting more power to unambitious patrioteers regardless of the implication for others. Your music taste-inspired statism further advocates that these folks use their newly attained power for good or evil as they individually decide. I reject this and every other form of statism because your music taste must have some sort of problem with reading comprehension. That's the only explanation I can come up with as to why your music taste accuses me of admitting that its activities are on the up-and-up. What I actually said is that if it were up to me, I would create a political atmosphere in which the zero-sum model of group competition gives way to coalitions among groups so that they can work together to lead us all toward a better, brighter future. At a minimum, I would like to see more people acknowledge that your music taste would have us believe that the goodness of something is in direct proportion only to the amount of teetotalism in said thing. Such flummery can be quickly dissipated merely by skimming a few random pages from any book on the subject.\u000a\u000a\u000aOut of the vast number of devastating evils for which jackbooted gutter-bloods are directly or indirectly responsible, I shall pick out only a single one which is most in keeping with the inner essence of your music taste's raffish traducements: allotheism. I have two words to say about your music taste's excuses: treacherous poppycock. You might think that anyone who doesn't know that your music taste is mean-spirited must be inhabiting a different world. Well, if that's the case, then I'm afraid your music taste's epigones must have spent the past month on Mars. Until we address this issue, we will never move beyond it.

sVAngra seems pretty popular here, why isnt one of their albums on the essentials list?
p7694
(lp7695
VIts a touchy subject that's been discussed ad nauseam actually. \u000a\u000aWhen the list was voted on not enough votes went to Angra. When talk of a list revision pops up it always devolves into arguing so SMW has left it as is. \u000a\u000aI will say. I did nominate Rebirth for the original list. But my cries went unheard. 
p7696
aVohh, i did not know the list was a vote, i figured it was more like an evolving and expanding list.  interesting, thats unfortunate.
p7697
aVI think I joined this sub after the Essentials list was created.\u000a\u000aI would've thrown a shitfit during the thing if Angra wasn't getting enough votes.
p7698
aVyeah, pretty surprising.  i didnt know it was a vote...
p7699
aVAngra definitely deserves a spot on any essential metal list, not only power metal lists. The masterpiece that is *Temple of Shadows*  can give me chills even though I've heard the songs innumerable times over the years.\u000a\u000aFor anyone more familiar (or more attentive than I am) with the essential list for the subreddit, has any band been added since the list was initially decided upon?
p7700
aVDragonland was added as a thanks for doing their AMA.  I think most people agreed they should have been up there in the first place and were ok with adding them. 
p7701
aVWith all due respect to Dragonland, that's a pretty terrible reason to be included (and as a [permanent member](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/1rwhoy/concerning_the_essential_album_list/cdrr662) no less).
p7702
aVWell normally I agree with you. But in the case of Dragonland they have arguably two albums that should be on the list. The only difference here was that they got to choose which album they wanted up there. 
p7703
aVStarfall and Astronomy!! (While they are my favourites, the popular opinion seems to be praising two other albums)
p7704
aVSo what I'm getting from this is that we need an Angra AMA. Let's make it happen guys!
p7705
aVI support this. 
p7706
aVAt this point, this issue has been discussed enough that I think we should simply have a vote on whether or not to add an Angra album, and which album it should be.\u000a\u000aAny other issues with the list could be handled, or not, at another time.\u000a
p7707
aVExcept that songs from THEY'RE NEW ALBUM haven't had much response. It's weird.
p7708
aVPeople are pretty miffed that neither South America nor Japan have any kind of representation on that list. If you really want albums to be added to that list, you gotta bring it up with our mod, /u/SpeakMouthWords. 
p7709
aVIf it were up to the voters, the list would be mostly Blind Guardian and Sabaton.  It was only through moderation that the list achieved some small semblance of being true to it's goal.  You can see the origin threads here:  \u000a1. http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/1bb6ch/contest_mode_activated_vote_here_for_the/  \u000a2. http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/1bkxq7/essentials_list_vote_results/  \u000a\u000aAt a certain point you have to give up and stop adding albums, or else "essential albums" just becomes "albums we think are pretty good yeah?"

p7731
(lp7732
VI'm still completely amazed that babymetal hasn't been completely dismissed by the metal community. People have taken it more of something fun and silly because japanese/korean culture is becoming more "cool". Seeing THIS many people at one of their shows is astounding and confusing though. I suppose with asian and american culture getting more interested with each other it was just a matter of time.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I'm a fan because this is the last thing I would have ever expected. It's so obscure. You just can't take it too serious.\u000a\u000aAs for DF working with them, GOOD! They've always catered to their japanese fanbase slightly more than others. If babymetal is going to be a thing, this is one way of making it somewhat more tolerable haha.
p7733
aVAlso, DF didn't write any "WHOAAA OHHHH OH OH!" sections into their last two albums. I laughed at how fucking long the whoaaaa section went on for  in the video.
p7734
aVThey were saving up their "whoas" and decided to blow them all on this, clearly.
p7735
aVNot sure how to judge the execution, but this is accurate.
p7736
aV&gt; I suppose with asian and american culture getting more interested with each other it was just a matter of time.\u000a\u000aThat's a weird thing to say.\u000a\u000aFirst, there is no "Asian culture"; every country has its own culture. Japan's culture is very different from China's culture, etc.\u000a\u000aSecond, metal isn't American culture: according to The Metal Archives, there are only ~21k bands (not all of them active) from the USA and they claim to have over 100k bands in their database. (I couldn't find an exact up to date number, but they made a blog post about reaching 100k recently.) And DragonForce is British, by the way.\u000a\u000aThird, metal was already popular in Japan before BABYMETAL started. TMA lists over 1500 bands from Japan, but many bands from other countries frequently have Japanese tours and/or include bonus tracks for the Japanese versions of their albums.
p7737
aVINb4 people getting pissed and saying it's not metal\u000a\u000aI'm not of that party, to be clear. I do not classify band genres based on my opinion.\u000a\u000aAlso, lol @ Babyforce
p7738
aVIt's not released yet, but it'll probably see an early 2015 release. I'll be honest and admit that it's not 100% confirmed that they wrote and performed it, but...c'mon...\u000a\u000a[Exhibit A](https://scontent-a-dfw.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10407960_705657209481548_4888527011638560816_n.jpg?oh=185e2b133ef0a06f69f46510211687f0&amp;oe=54D1C998)\u000a\u000a[Exhibit B](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2014/11/10/new-babymetal-song-the-one-appears-online-rumored-to-have-dragonforces-herman-li-and-sam-totman-guesting/)\u000a\u000a[Exhibit C](https://www.facebook.com/hermanli.online/posts/10152864230839711)\u000a\u000aExhibit D - this video; that's some undeniable DF guitar hooks in the intro, and that "whoa" part sounds like every other song DF has written.\u000a\u000aThoughts? Instead of blindly downvoting because it's BABYMETAL, how about we get some opinions on how people feel about DF doing a collab with BABYMETAL. Is it good or bad for DragonForce and for power metal? Has your opinion on BABYMETAL changed after seeing this video? This isn't their first undeniable power metal track, and judging by their recent focus on performing at metal festivals this year (Sonisphere, Heavy MTL, Loud Park), I'd venture to say you're going to hear a lot more metal in their music.\u000a\u000aAlso, "recorded", not "performed", my bad.
p7739
aVIMO, the metal genre is still more full of itself than it's ever had the right to be, and it's just as manufactured as anything out there to begin with. I have no illusions about that, I just like the music. And that's all it really is; it's just music and art. IMO BM is fun, a kind of mindless fun that I like at least, nothing more, and I fucking love that about it. Helloween were fun and weird once upon a time, even SA too. Hell, anyone remember Mr. Bungle? If it acts as a gateway to other bands for someone, great. But it's fun enough as it is to me. 
p7740
aVIf they can actually make more good power metal instead of making weird J-Pop metal, I might actually be interested. So we'll have to wait and see if they start making more straightforward power metal. I am hopeful though, maybe Dragonforce can be a positive influence on them.
p7741
aVIn terms of exposure I'm sure it's great for both Babymetal and DragonForce.  For power metal in general, no, it's still a turd.\u000a\u000aThe average metal fan won't appreciate the manufactured nature of the band, the cutesy juxtaposition, the emphasis on choreography and underemphasis on anyone actually playing an instrument.  It's for people who say "kawaii" out loud and spend their days posting unfunny memes of teenage Japanese girls.\u000a\u000aIt's a fad and will either die quickly or spawn it's own weird little thing, don't expect any miracles of metal adoption.  Without a switch to English language I doubt it will spread much past the weeaboo population.
p7742
aV&gt;It's a fad and will either die quickly or spawn it's own weird little thing, don't expect any miracles of metal adoption.\u000a\u000aRegardless of how one feels about Babymetal, this is really the key thing. The band largely relies on a gimmick -- and it doesn't help the band's or style's popularity that that gimmick is a blending of two styles who's audiences don't have much overlap. \u000a\u000aThis really isn't going to effect DragonForce or power metal at all. DragonForce fans already aren't known for being the core of the core power metal listeners, and I don't see many people discovering Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray, or Falconer from a Babymetal introduction.
p7743

aVSome of these were difficult for me as most of my favourites didn't get to the voting stage (HammerFall, Edguy, Dragonforce, Twilight Force, Primal Fear etc.). Here were my votes:\u000a\u000aBest album: Falconer - Black Moon Rising - Tough call between this, Sabaton, and Sonata Arctica, but I think this will have the most lasting power for me.\u000a\u000aBest song: Sabaton - Night Witches - This song takes everything I love about Sabaton and throws a slight twist in it. Absolutely brilliant, and one of my favourite songs of the year.\u000a\u000aSong with best solo: Dragonforce - No More - Dragonforce was my #1 album of the year last year, and their guitar work is one of the biggest reasons why.\u000a\u000aBest unsigned release: Enceladus - Journey To Enlightenment - This album really blew me away. I hope people really take notice of them this year.\u000a\u000aBest female fronted release: Mindmaze - Back From The Edge - Honestly, I didn't hear any of these albums, but I have Mindmaze's first album and it's pretty great, so I'd expect more of the same here.\u000a\u000aBest Non-Guitar Instrumentation - Alestorm - Sunset on the Golden Age - Not too much to say here. I really like Alestorm\u000a\u000aBest album cover - Twilight Force - Tales of Ancient Prophecies - Yes, it's excessively cheesy, but that's what power metal is all about!\u000a\u000aSinger of the year - Ralf Scheepers - I feel like the only person who even listened to Delivering The Black. This album is a masterpiece! Scheepers is quickly reaching Kiske-levels of epicness for me. His performance on this album is out of this world, and he is even better live.\u000a\u000aAlbum with the best lyrics: Falconer - Black Moon Rising - I really wanted to vote Twilight Force, but I just couldn't.\u000a\u000aLifetime Achievement: Joacim Cans - I expect Kiske to win (and deservingly so), but HammerFall is my favourite band and (r)Evolution is a step back in the right direction.\u000a\u000aMightiest warrior of 2014 - Chris Bay - Every single video I've ever watched of Freedom Call shows Chris Bay having the time of his life. In a genre already filled with cheese, Freedom Call is cheesier than any other band. Despite the flack they take for it (even from people who like the genre), Bay continues on creating more inspiring, positive music. Getting FC back on track in 2014 is great, but Bay's attitude makes him the mightiest warrior of 2014.\u000a\u000aUpsword Award: Unlost Horizon - Can't say I know the users here too well, but every time I see Unlost Horizon post, it's usually something good.
p7775
aV&gt; Singer of the year - Ralf Scheepers - I feel like the only person who even listened to Delivering The Black. This album is a masterpiece!\u000a\u000aI placed it as my Best Album this year. I guess it didn't get enough nominations though.
p7776

p7782
aVOh, I see, this is like a second voting round now that all the nominees are determined. I'll go vote 
p7783
aVhuh?  When did we get new moderators?
p7784
aV/u/SpeakMouthWords stepped down over the weekend and modded the four of us.
p7785
aVYeah, I just read the post about the new mods.  Hope this is for the best!
p7786
aVVery cool to see Viathyn getting nominated for 3 awards! We were notified of these awards via a message to our facebook page suggesting we post the link to the google doc, so I did.
p7787
aVWell, to be fair, basically one person (anyone on this subreddit) could make a single nomination and they would end up on there. That's why you might think it odd that Albedo is up there for that specific nomination (which was my nomination, and I didn't expect it to actually end up on there, but hell yeah, it did)

asVthe first video from the new Orden Ogan album, F.E.V.E.R., has dropped
p7791
(lp7792
VThis sounds great. I'll probably be picking this one up. "To The End" was my first experience with Orden Ogan and it's really awesome.
p7793
aVIf you haven't grab their prior albums as well.  You can tell To The End is more polished, but they are all good!
p7794
aVMine as well, thanks to this sub. They're probably my favorite PM band discovery since I learned of Angra about ten years ago. 
p7795
aVI suppose I am the only one not liking this that much?  It was catchy and pretty decent, but nothing special.  I feel like I have heard this song a thousand times before.
p7796
aVI agree with you and to be honest, most power metal being released on the last 5 years or so is very repetitive and stale. This song is a perfect example of something that sounds good but it' a huge dejavu
p7797
aVyou're entitled to your opinion. nothing wrong with that.
p7798
aVNot a fan of comments like this.  Thanks captain obvious...
p7799
aVthe fuck you want me to say? you're an idiot and your opinion sucks? heaven forbid I don't tear you down for a difference of opinion.\u000a\u000ago into your "state of power metal" post and add the Wheaton rule to the list of shit you're complaining about.
p7800
aVSaying "you're entitled to your opinion nothing wrong with that" is shying away from any discussions that come with disagreements.  That is not the way to go about it either.  It is a pretty non-engaging and pointless comment to make and puts people into a neutral attitude instead of creating interesting discussion.
p7801
aV/u/Phyralis is right. Just saying that is pointless and it's just stating the obvious.
p7802
aVI apologize. Next time I'll ask both of you for your opinions before I have the nerve to not criticize. How dare I.\u000a\u000aP.S.: thanks for the downvote.... they show me when I'm on the money.
p7803
aVIt doesn't make you a shitty person or redditor, really.  I'm just blunt, to the point, and a bit of a dick.  Don't take it personally, you're not a bad person!
p7804
aVI've realized Orden Ogan is Sabaton with actual guitar riffs. I really liked this.
p7805
aVwait, you actually agree with me on something? are you high? o_O
p7806
aVNevermind, now that i think abut it, its a stupid song.
p7807
aVno take-backsies.
p7808
aVThis sounds absolutely nothing like Sabaton
p7809
aVWhile I would put Orden Ogan leagues ahead of Sabaton, to my ears they both follow a similar formula.  
p7810
aVThey aren't ahead, they just have a different style
p7811
aVI like Sabaton's choruses and basically nothing else about them (aside from maybe lyrics).  I love everything Orden Ogan does, so maybe there's some truth to this?
p7812
aVI like it. Love that bagpipes part reminds me of Skiltron which is a good thing. Make-up reminds me of Powerwolf which is also a good thing. And that is some deep mud right there.
p7813
aVThis is awesome. Already my front-runner for 2015 album of the year.\u000aBut, again, I don't really know what else is coming out.
p7814
aVThere's a new Angra, Battle Beast, Orden Ogan, and Blind Guardian just in January!
p7815
aVSpeaking of Angra. Is there any Japanese digital music store I can purchase from in the states?
p7816
aVIt's a long shot, but you might want to check out Amazon Japan's digital music service. I don't know if they carry bonus tracks though, which is why I'm assuming you want the Japanese versions.
p7817
aVI did check, but at the time, they only showed the CD, no digital version. I want the Japanese version because I want to pay the band but I also don't want to wait for NA release. \u000a\u000aedit: Checked again and it looks as though the digital version isn't released until January anyway. Oh well.
p7818
aVAhhh, you're right.\u000aThe Angra singles have pleasantly surprised me.\u000a\u000aBattle Beast and Blind Guardian, ehhh.
p7819
aVMan they just get better with every album. 
p7820
aVSo it's safe to say I'll be picking this one up.
p7821
aVI am a big fan of that intro, with the choir of vocals with minimal background notes. Never heard of this band before, but they're fantastic. 
p7822
aVlisten to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70oWsgDgDqg) immediately.
p7823
asVKind of an outsider... please don't flame me... Looking for the most melodic and symphonic fantasy themed stuff (like Twilight Force)
p7824
(lp7825
VWell I think Nightwish is one of the obvious answears when it comes to more symphonic stuff:\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NnCg4lSKVM\u000a\u000aIf you are in to fantasy themed lyrics and not afraid of folk elements, then you should check out elvenking as well:\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN9j3nlMwao\u000a\u000aAnd If you think "harder" stuff might work for you as well, then Equilibrium is one of the greatest bands ever:\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHy81GG6k2o
p7826
aVThank you. I'm familiar with Nightwish and Elvenking. Gonna check out Equilibrium now. \u000a\u000a**edit**: Equilibrium is pretty awesome and I'll listen to them whenever I'm in the mood for heavier stuff but it's not really what I'm looking for at the moment
p7827
aV[**Pathfinder's**](http://youtu.be/uhKXPWtGJ38) first album *Beyond the Space, Beyond the Time* is a masterpiece, and their second album is pretty great too. Unfortunately, they've lost their singer &amp; his replacement isn't exactly up to par imo.\u000a\u000a\u000a[**Fairyland's**](http://youtu.be/LMLrVYc18Ao) album *Of Wars In Osyrhia*  is fantastic as well\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd if you like that, you'll probably like [**Dark Moor's**](http://youtu.be/eXOly5-lBjU) *The Hall of the Olden Dreams* and *The Gates of Oblivion* since they feature the same vocalist as *Of Wars In Osyrhia*.\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso, if you haven't checked out all of [**Luca Turilli's**](http://youtu.be/tSJ633aoyfc) work, you definitely should! Since you're a fan of rhapsody and all. His album *King of the Nordic Twlight* is a classic and his other work is great too.\u000a\u000aI'm honestly surprised no one has mentioned these, they seem to fit your initial description more so than anything else, though perhaps you've heard of them already
p7828
aVWasn't sure if someone was gonna mention Pathfinder, but so glad you did.\u000a\u000aBeyond the Space Beyond the Time is one of my favourite albums of all time and space.
p7829
aVI would just like to add that Fairyland's **Score to a New Beginning** is superb, OP should check out both ;)
p7830
aVsecond score to a new beginning, i love that album.
p7831
aVI've never been a huge fan of **[Kamelot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Trjxuc6Q2c)**, but I think they may be exactly what you're looking for. Since I'm not huge into them, that may not be the best (or most representative) song by them, but the video is fucking awesome regardless. So I implore you to investigate further, particularly with the album the Black Halo. Male vocals (exclusively?)  \u000a\u000a**[Celesty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNf9lWNG5ls)** is another band that I would suggest that is very symphonic and pretty awesome. Male vocals\u000a\u000a**[Amberian Dawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RTJzxZGaxA)** looks like it might be promising for what you're looking for. Female vocals  \u000a**[Ancient Bards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeszIVnvo6o)** is another one. Female vocals  \u000a**[Bane of Winterstorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88RBTSsHVmY)** is pretty sweet, a little closer to pure symphonic than power metal. Male + Female vocals  \u000a**[Battlelore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTlU-NYBi7A)** is awesome, specifically for their dedication to singing about Lord of the Rings. They're also more symphonic/epic than power. Beauty and the beast vocals  \u000a**[Dreamtale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAZsyF8yo8)** is one I'm not too familiar with, but they sound pretty sweet and symphonic. Male vocals with male and female backing vocals  \u000aShout out for **[Keldian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF0rubiOdwg)**, although I figure you've already heard them and they're space themed, not fantasy. Male vocals  \u000a**[Kemilon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsC1v6DP7OE)** is along the same lines as Keldian (name even sounds similar :/), and it sounds like they've got some crazy synth/electronic stuff going? maybe that works for you, I dunno. Male vocals  
p7832
aVHoisting my sword to this great post! Thank you. 
p7833
aVKamelot is great, although they're less energetic and bombastic than the stuff you mentioned. They have some of the best symphonic compositions of any metal band I've seen. Check out the album "The Black Halo" (it's on the sidebar)\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPiy535fmUI\u000aAlso, while they're not my favorite, Gloryhammer are fairly similar to twilight force\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlhQZFTvAn4
p7834
aVPathfinder - Beyond the Space, Beyond the Time.  This is what you are looking for.

aVi really like derdian, i think you would enjoy them too, they use a lot of keyboard and classical elements\u000a\u000aim on mobile right now but look up Incitement, its older but one of my fave songs by them

aVIf youi don't mind Japanese check out [Versailles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5ULxuUZjrc) 
p7840
aVI always recommend Wisdom. They're not very "Dungeons &amp; Dragons/LotR straight fantasy", but still very epic.
p7841
aVJust gonna throw [Serenity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_8XUhfnv2g) out there. It isn't fantasy-themed, but it's pretty kick-ass symphonic power metal.
p7842
aVYou might like [Lost Horizon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYdbLfLnIHk)\u000a\u000aAs others have said Kamelot is great(my favorite band).If you want closer to power try The Fourth Legacy,if you want melodic The Black Halo\u000a\u000a[Hammerfall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em0GSw4qIFQ) might appeal to you.\u000a\u000a[Avantasia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNuwOYQPr-s)\u000a\u000aLast but not least [Stratovarius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKI2Nu7oJ8)\u000a\u000a

p7856
(lp7857
VI was just listening to this album earlier today. It's astounding how good of a songwriter Tobi is. This is one of my favourites from the new album, though to be fair, nearly every song on that album is a favourite of mine.
p7858
aVIt's a little strange how divided people are over the album. It's not really a "love it or hate it" thing as much as a "love it or don't care about it" one. Personally, I loved every song except for "Sleepwalking," but I know some folks of whom that was the only song they really liked.
p7859
aVHeh, sounds like we're in a similar boat. This was the first Avantasia album I ever found, and it was _devastating._ Devastatingly awesome. All except _Sleepwalking_ -- at first. But even that's grown on me. Seems like the whole thing tells a sweeping story, so unlike most other albums out there.
p7860
asVSo Helloween new album is coming out in May
p7861
(lp7862
VI am really excited for this one. The two latest albums have been amazing. But, but, the album art is ugly as sin :(

aVThat album art is just awful :/ especially compared to some of the awesome covers they've made in the past.
p7864
aVI am really excited for this one. Several previous albums have been was ugly :-(

aVGreat cover artwork!
p7867
aVReally looking forward to this. The last few Helloween records have been awesome! Cover art looks pretty great too.
p7868
aVI haven't enjoyed Helloween since Kai Hansen left. They were awful when I saw them, except for when they played the old songs.
p7869
aVReally? I think their past 4 or 5 albums have been amazing. Made me forget about the old stuff. I highly recommend 7 Sinners or Gambling with the Devil. Give them a listen.
p7870
aVTheir only misstep was Pink Bubbles imo. 
p7871
aVI think the opposite of them live. Deris can't do justice to the Kiske songs, but the songs from his time in the band are incredible live.

aVDefinitely a step up from Unsung Heroes if comparing this song to the overall quality of that album. \u000a\u000aThis song though doesn't hold a candle to Victory Songs (my personal fave). The mix has the guitar melodies so muddy that they might as well just have rhythm and forget writing any lead melodies.\u000a\u000aI'll definitely be giving the album a chance. I've in general been very happy with their stuff. 
p7891
aVWHAT A DAY. New Jorn Lande song, new Orden Ogan and new Ensiferum
p7892
aVCertainly better than the opening from Unsung Heroes. I don't know what they did with the drums but for me they make the song, which is strange considering I play guitar. The guitar riff(s) are certainly very good, though it would be nice if we could actually hear them at any point after the intro. The solo doesn't stand out much either, the seemingly random harmonics don't really appeal.\u000a\u000aDon't know what made them include the choir/shouting in there, perhaps trying to imitate other modern power metal bands, but after listening to this I have very high hopes for the album.

aVYeah! I mean this is a Power Metal Sub-Reddit! How dare you post Power Metal in it! Sure you've got like 19 upvotes showing that people approve of your post and all but...C'mon!
p7900
aVPeople are voting on it based on the name, not because it makes a notable contribution to the sub. Some Blind Guardian is fine and good, but the past few days have seen a bit too much.
p7901
aVAgain, my apologies. Weren't you the last one to post this particular song, Edledhron of the Noldor?
p7902
aVYeah, though there was less of a BG flood then, plus it was a special occasion with Tolkien's birthday.\u000a\u000aBut like I said, I don't take an issue with BG being posted, they've just had a lot of coverage on the sub lately, so it's best to get some other names in there too. If any particular band was receiving a bit too much attention, we'd be saying the same thing.

VDecent album, Cynosure is leaps and bounds ahead, though. \u000a\u000aBut that cover art.... it looks like a fridge magnet made by a kid in second grade. Completely kills it for me.
p7952
aVI don't mind the album art too much. It's not amazing by any stretch, but there are FAR worse IMHO.
p7953
aVCertainly true, but had I seen the cover art, before hearing the band, I'd definitely skip over it.
p7954
aVI also like the cover art. Could be much worse. The Peregrine Way was basically a mellower, slower, more positive version of Viathyn's style. Less power and more prog. I'm okay with that, but I like their newer album more as well.
p7955
aVi really liked the cover art :(\u000a
p7956
aVLook up! Space is cool! :)
p7957
aVI hope you continue to enjoy it. Don't let my opinion change yours.
p7958
aVJake from Viathyn here! Regarding the cover art: I totally agree. We had originally commissioned someone else to do it and he kind of dropped the ball for meeting any kind of deadlines. Another dude came forward and said he would do a traditional style painting for it. His sketches looked really awesome but the final product came out rather... 'pastel-y'. By that point we had reached our printing deadline, so we submitted it. haha.

aVhaven't thought of that yet. But has Nickelback a piano strong like this? In the new Album they have very wonderful songs. I like "on the morrow much" I \u000a
p7964
aVI don't think my problem is with the music side of it, but rather the vocals. Very plain and standard. That's just my opinion, though.
p7965
aVthen you may enjoy songs from In Legend in those he have some help. like stardust :) with Inga from VC &lt;3. In "on the morrow" there is a gospel. I love this part. But i think you are right. The vocals are ok but not the blast. But even so, the singer - Bastian Emig - composing, playing piano and playing drums at VC. That is something :) This man has great ideas!

(lp7996
sVWhat do you perceive were/are the best years of power metal, and what has (since) changed to make it better/worse?
p7997
(lp7998
VI've been liking enough of the recent releases of this genre overall. I especially love what's been happening with Kiske's voice. 
p7999
aVHard to say cos nostalgia will always blur things a bit I guess the genre found it's footing and had it's glory years in the decade spanning late 80s to late 90s. I personally love 97-03 ish for nostalgic reasons. \u000a\u000aIMHO I think since then we've had another boom and golden age. We've seen our fair share of generic ones sure but we've also seen some unique stuff and some bands really pushing the envelope and production has only gotten better and more ambitious. Power metal has never been so diverse and varied. The wealth of and access to new, unsigned bands is great. The downsides arguably are once great vocalists losing their touch (Kai, Tobi), some gimmicky acts and a few decent bands mis-stepping with an album or two. Nothing that isn't common to every music genre I'm sure.
p8000
aVThe late 90's to early 2000's (1997 - 2002) is an amazing time. Great amount of metal came out then.
p8001
aVEarly 00's was the best era by far. Back when the biggest bands actually played metal instead of pop music.
p8002
aVNah man, 2014 was by far the best year bro, we got babymetal, new amaranthe, twilight force, dragonforce oh so inspired album, schaffers fresh riffs and a billion totally *un*distinguable jpm albums. What do you mean by pop music? Can't you hear amaranthe sick metal riffs?
p8003
aVWhat are you talking about? They are totally distinguishable. That one band is little girls and that other one is sexy vampires. 
p8004
aVAll the old stuff is still there for you to listen to\u000a\u000aAnd more stuff is continually being released.\u000a\u000aSo, in my opinion, the present is the best, and will only continue to continue being the best.
p8005
aVFor the sake of discussion its safe to say op was talking about each year in a vacuum. 
p8006
aVYou're not answering his question; he is asking about the best outputs of power metal in a particular year (or years) and what has changed since those times. \u000a\u000aTo answer the OP, the best years for me were early to late 1980's. Manilla Road, Jag Panzer, Liege Lord, Scanner. I can't bring myself to listen to most modern power metal. 
p8007
aVThe best years are:\u000a\u000a1988, 1989, 1990, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2015.\u000a\u000aThe year of release of the 10 best power metal album of all time, by a very very large margin.\u000a
p8008
aVMost of my personal favorite stuff is from the first decade of this millennium.\u000a\u000aThe genre is becoming more diverse, good in some cases and bad in other cases.
p8009
aV**2003.** No question.\u000a\u000aDelirium Veil &amp; A Flame to the Ground Beneath.\u000a\u000aLast month /u/mushmancat made a [great post](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2qh66l/my_favorite_pm_albums_from_each_year/) where he gives his top albums of each year going back to 83.

p8012
aVOk so turns out Twilightning WEREN'T on the compilation I was talking about (I just rememebr hearing them around that time).\u000a\u000aThe compilation is called "Absolute Power Metal - The Definitive Collection".\u000a\u000aHere's one of the first pages I found on it that's NOT a link to a torrent :P \u000ahttps://musicbrainz.org/release/45471b78-f50a-475f-900d-c767e88a4d83\u000a\u000aHave a listen mate, it's a nice collection of tracks. Should keep you busy for a while!\u000a\u000aAlso, why the fuck do I get a downvoted? Usually metalheads are not so downvotey. Must not be true metalheads.
p8013
aV2001-2005ish. Because that's when I discovered it and nostalgia, right?\u000a\u000aI see power metal as a very vocalist-driven genre and I think most of the genres best vocalists were in their absolute prime around 2003ish (Heiman, Khan, Poyhia, Parcharidis, Kakko, Cans, Kotipelto, Falaschi, etc.). Most of those great bands have since disbanded or have just gotten too old.

aVThat's why I like Sonata Arctica, their music celebrates and places in uplifting tones the trials and tribulations of the human soul.\u000a\u000aEdit: not *all* of it is in uplifting tones
p8046
aVSonata Artica was one of my favourite bands. I introduced my ex to them and they quickly became her favourite band too. When we broke up I no longer heard the uplifting tones and could only really hear the lyrics. \u000a\u000aThe music made me feel like shit... the memories etc they would conjure, as well as the lyrical themes in general. I couldn't listen to them (and a few other bands as well) at all. \u000a\u000aOne day I just decided that I had listened to them for years before we had met, and that I wasn't going to let something that was out of my control affect the things that I enjoy. I listen to them all the time!
p8047
aVSame here!  It and Wolf and Raven are the most awesome songs they've written!  Silence was an awesome album.

aVThis is the song that got me into Sonata Arctica (and Victoria's Secret became one of my favorite songs of all time shortly after). \u000a\u000aI like it more than the original because it just feels like a song that needs to be played a little bit faster.

Will post opinion.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aWell, i wasn't expecting it to be an amazing record but this is just flat out boring, i was thinking about doing a track by track thingy but why bother, this is just to tame and plays way to safe. Inhale is by far the biggest offender, fucking boring. The first song is good and kicks the album perfectly but the rest is just bad, too simplistic, almost lifeless. Heiman is not to blame here, unless he wrote the music which i'm sure he didn't, he does a great job on the vocals and delivers a solid performance. The rest just lacks in all aspects.
p8070
aVThats... Really disappointing. Worth a listen though?
p8071

aVI like a lot of Savatage, but I counted them in as 80's Hairband because they just sound like that to me, especially in my favorite by them, Hall of the Mountain King.\u000a\u000aDidnt know they were PM.\u000a\u000aEdit: I just scrolled down on the hot section and find Hall of the Mountain King. I thought when I discovered Savatage that I was special :(\u000a\u000aEdit 2: Good Lord, so much Savatage, I have found my people.
p8101
aVThey are, pretty much, an 80's traditional metal band\u000a\u000aand for the most part, Power Metal is stuck in the 80s and doesn't ever want to let go. There's a whole lot of crossover between glam, traditional and power metal, at least when you take the non-symphonic stuff into account. But I think that Jon Oliva's other stuff (Jon Oliva's Pain and TSO) have really worked together to secure him and Savatage as a whole into the power metal area. So, maybe they're not power metal, but I'm not going to genre-war with anyone. Also, if not us, then who will appreciate Savatage? Not r/Metal, for the most part, so it's gotta be us\u000a\u000aAlso, we just had Savatagurday on r/PowerMetal, so that's why there's so much of it recently

aVThis is one of my favorite albums with a simpler feel. I love all the songs, especially "Come Alive" and "Truth About Our Time." 
p8189
aVDefinitely two of my fav tracks! 
p8190
aVI dunno it gets a lot of love here!
p8191
aVJust when researching the album it's popularity wasn't exactly high xD
p8192
aVWouldn't call this underrated. It received praise across the board when it came out. If you're referring to in r/powermetal that's probably because it's not really power metal. 
p8193
aVYeah, it's melodic heavy metal, or something.
p8194
aVYer I wasn't sure what it was either...I think melodic heavy metal is a good description ^_^ - I just thought it was a great song that needed some love haha 
p8195
aVI would say it's power metal. It has Russell Allen, Jorn, and Magnus Karlsson (guitarist). It's not as bombastic as some other power metal, but I'm not big on taxonomy anyway. Although almost all good metal is "melodic," so throwing "melodic" in front of everything doesn't do much in my opinion. You guys should check out Magnus Karlsson's other work too. He's a phenomenal guitarist featured on the first three Allen Lande albums, the latest few Primal Fear albums, and he has a solo album, Free Fall, with guest singers. 
p8196
aVYes! I absolutely LOVE his guitar style...it's right up my alley - I've got his solo album which I'm going to listen to soon but I really wanna check out his other stuff :)\u000a\u000aAlso I agree, it's kinda heavy/power metally - But whatever it is, it's great!

p8230
aVThey also brought Xandria in the show I went to see, who is incredible live and as a whole, I saw them and it was well worth it. Especially since US tickets (where I live)  were so damn cheap $25.\u000a
p8231
aV25 bucks was such a damn steal. The cheapest concert I've ever been to and arguably one of my favorites.
p8232
aVHonestly man, like here in California, not so many people are into the genre which is sad and good at the same time. Fewer bands tour out here and less frequently, but when they do tour, tickets are always much cheaper and you always get a close up view of the band!
p8233
aVI suppose Freedom Call fits the album more, Delain has much more of a pop/symphonic sound :P
p8234
aVAs per Sonata Arctica:\u000a\u000a"It\u2019s been some months since we released the re-recorded version of our debut album Ecliptica and of course we couldn\u2019t resist the temptation of attempting to play the whole album front to back live. Hence, we\u2019re happy to announce the Ecliptica special shows in Europe. On these shows we\u2019ll perform Ecliptica in it\u2019s entirety as well as assorted hits from our catalog. This is a one time thing only, don\u2019t miss it.\u000a\u000aAs special guest we will bring Freedom Call, who will celebrate the 10th anniversary of their \u2018Eternity\u2019 album and play a special set around that album."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSo, yeah, I'm going to do whatever I can to go see this tour. Freedom Call playing 'Eternity' and Sonata Arctica playing 'Ecliptica' in full? Nostalgia++

VMy favorite song off the latest album. Getting Marc Hudson and experimenting with slower tempos and anthem-like song structures really reinvented the band in my opinion. I can't imagine them composing a song like this or [Cry Thunder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU4GXgaCFTI) on their first few albums. 
p8261
aVI'm wondering, Is there any reason a lot of bands are recording their live videos\u005calbums in Japan?
p8262
aVDragonforce their reputation isn't what it used to be in western countries, but with the collab with Baby Metal, their popularity in Japan raised a lot. It's mainly the audience that is absolutely great for these live albums.
p8263
aVThese live music videos are terrible.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Wow, a "live" clip from a "live DVD" with the studio version over top of it.  DragonForce, no, pls.\u000a\u000aEDIT 2: God, I shouldn't post when it's this late.  So they say it's strictly a video clip from the DVD with the studio version of the song over it, the implication being that the DVD will have the live version and that this is the music video.\u000a\u000aSo... yeah.  These live music videos are terrible.

Your text doesn't say you aren't, so I don't want to assume. If not, I'd suggest you check out [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/272nlh/a_beginners_guide_to_sonata_arctica/).

p8411
aVClassic\u000a\u000aThis is the song that got me into power metal
p8412
aVAfter many years of ignoring Falconer (for no real reason), I bought this album and their new album a week and a half ago and they both floored me. I'm completely on board with these guys.\u000a\u000aWhat album should I buy next if I'm seeing them live? I think one of their really popular songs is from the second album? It seems hard to guess their setlist because it doesn't look like they play live very often.
p8413
aVThe second one is *Chapters from a Vale Forlorn*. The song you're referring to might be [Clarion Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iswq0SWBRFA).\u000a\u000a\u000a[*Northwind*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW2gsLyhk9g) and [*Among Beggars and Thieves*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1OdE5IslmU)(5&amp;6) are some of their more popular albums.\u000a\u000a\u000aThird and fourth albums have a different vocalist, and just aren't as good/popular as the others.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe two newer ones - [*Armod*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jirq0rz_0xo) and [*Black Moon Rising*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv05oHDjus4) are great imo, although *Armod* is entirely in Swedish.\u000a\u000a\u000aJust my thoughts on the albums, I have no idea what they might be performing live.
p8414
aVFirst self titled is amazing.  In addition to Mindtraveler, there is my favorite Heresy in Disguise.  Also Quest for the Crown and Lord of the Blacksmiths.  So killer!
p8415
aVThanks for the rundown. Clarion Call is the song I was referring to. I will definitely check out Chapters From A Vale Forlorn next, followed by Northwind and Among Beggars and Thieves. I will likely skip Armod for now because I have difficult with non-English music, but this will keep me busy for a while!

aVTheir last live gig ever will be ProgPower in Atlanta September 2015.  If you are seeing them clear out some memory and store it forever!

p8435
aVPlease don't.
p8436
aVEh I want to look at this album in a good way, what do we get?\u000a\u000a1. Timeless Miracle risen from the dead\u000a\u000a2. Sonata Arctica music that probably will end up more powerful than what Sonata is currently doing in terms of style (Look at revisited, I know you love that album...)\u000a\u000aAt least these are good points to look forward to. Can't help much if you don't like the bands involved though.
p8437
aVI don't even want to be shitting on this well-meaning project, but this is a tribute to a tired band (that I still love somehow), which is likely to have a brickwalled bad mix and a bunch of shady bands that can barely keep up with the originals. Worth one listen? Probably. Like you said, that's already better than Revisited. 
p8438
aVAnd people call me cynical...
p8439
aVPasi isn't mixing it man, just mastering. (If you are thinking he is bad at mastering, he didn't master Pariah's Child or Revisited, but he did mix those)\u000a\u000a&gt;that doesn't mean he's good at mastering though\u000a\u000a:(\u000a\u000aAs for the bands, I will make sure to complain if a really bad band makes it on there. Haven't seen any so far. The less popular ones actually have a great sound. The guy making the album gives a shit if they would play Sonata well, and he's very carefully choosing the last couple of bands.\u000a\u000aExamples:\u000a\u000a[Innvein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg0_38iQ624) &lt;-their singer's actually great!\u000a\u000a[Sunrise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGJlG0fYbGg) &lt;-Sunrise has been posted around here quite a bit\u000a\u000a[Majesty of Revival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoezC-kZ6vM) &lt;-The cage seems like a great song for this band to cover\u000a\u000a[Celestial Wish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Hb5FnwDnMU) &lt;-A female singer on paid in full sounds like a great idea if you ask me, it's not a super demanding song and I think this band (which is probably the least famous of those announced) could do it well.\u000a\u000aAlso I'm not -'ing your posts.
p8440
aVMy heart is full of hope!\u000a\u000a^^^and ^^^my ^^^head ^^^is ^^^hard ^^^to ^^^fool\u000a

aVI blame the mastering on Nuclear Blast for it is a label-wide problem they have. If he truly did Revisited, he should never be allowed near a console again. Not even a Nintendo, just to be safe. They probably have some music game on there.\u000a\u000aVan Canto, fuck...
p8442
aVRevisited doesn't sound bad. I no longer listen a lot Power metal / Sonata Arctica, but I own the Live in Finland blu ray and the mixing/mastering is awful. I don't know if it's the same guy though :p
p8443
aVI think it is. Live is a work of art in how not to mix a band. I like to A/B Blank File studio and live to remind myself how shitty it is.

V[Sabaton - Twilight of the Thunder God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZrCQFSkLcE)\u000a\u000aI'm not a huge Sabaton fan, but their music is really good for personal motivation. \u000a\u000a[Kamelot - March of Mephisto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJh4CijYvRw)\u000a\u000aLess of a "gym" song and more of a "get-shit-done" song.  Having  Roy Khan and Shagrath playing the devil and berating you for weakness  is a hell of a motivator. \u000a\u000a[Visigoth - Mammoth  Rider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aWRh0IkRtc)\u000a\u000aHeavy in the oldest sense of the term. \u000a\u000a[Heidevolk - Vulgaris Magistralis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reOLeLX0Q9U)\u000a\u000aNot a lot to say. Mammoth riding seems to be a common theme in my favorite get-shit-done songs. \u000a\u000a[Bolt Thrower- Dead Armour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ssrpexU1o) \u000a\u000aNot power metal in the slightest.

p8571
aVWell, yeah, I agree but you know... power metal subreddit... bands that don't have the voice of an angel is too violent for them.
p8572
aVI actually like some bands with harsh vocals (used to listen to Deicide a few years ago), though admittedly some I listen to now are more on the happier side (Equilibrium, Ensiferum).\u000a\u000a@ mushmancat I had not heard of Absu before, but I youtubed them and listened to Stone of Destiny. It wasn't in-you-face fast but it was surprisingly upbeat, I enjoyed it. Any album / song in particular that you'd recommend?

p8616
(lp8617
VI wish bands would stop releasing stuff like this.  This kind of generic take on power metal does not get bands anywhere anymore, especially when it lacks power and energy.  Bands need to take the time to craft their songs and make them unique.
p8618
aVThis is why I like to listen to bands who try something new, even if they haven't gotten it super tight yet.
p8619
asVI made a list of my top albums each year from 1982 onwards.
p8620
(lp8621
V&gt;1989 - Blind Guardian - Follow the Blind  \u000a&gt;1992 - Blind Guardian - Somewhere Far Beyond  \u000a&gt;1995 - Blind Guardian - Imaginations from the Other Side  \u000a&gt;1998 - Blind Guardian - Nightfall in Middle Earth  \u000a&gt;2002 - Blind Guardian - A Night at the Opera  \u000a&gt;2006 - Blind Guardian - A Twist in the Myth  \u000a&gt;2010 - Blind Guardian - At the Edge of Time   \u000a&gt;2015 - Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror  \u000a\u000aDo you like Blind Guardian?
p8622
aVYeah, it's safe to say that I do. But to tell the truth, those years don't seem to have much to compete.
p8623
aVI know we're mostly just power metal fans here but here's some of the competition for reference for those years.  I'm assuming other genres are ok since you have non-PM on your list:   \u000a   \u000a1989 - Running Wild - Death and Glory, Savatage - Gutter Ballet, Helstar - Nosferatu, Fates Warning - Perfect Symmetry  \u000a  \u000a1992 - Dream Theater - Images and Words, Iron Maiden - Fear of the Dark, Immortal - Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism, Iced Earth - Night of the Stormrider, Darkthrone - A Blaze in the Northern Sky  \u000a  \u000a1995 - Mutha fuckin Land of the Free, Bal-Sagoth - A Black Moon Broods over Lemuria, Death - Symbolic, Virgin Steele - The Marriage of Heaven and Hell part 2\u000a   \u000a1998 - Nightfall runs away with this one for most power metal fans but: Death - Sound of Perseverance, Nightwish - Oceanborn, Rhapsody - Symphony of Enchanted Lands  \u000a  \u000a2002 - Immortal - Sons of Northern Darkness, Agalloch - The Mantle, Symphony X - The Odyssey, Vintersorg - Visions From The Spiral Generator, Threshold - Critical Mass\u000a  \u000a2006 - Dragonland - Astronomy (runaway PM album of the year), Summoning - Oath Bound, Celtic Frost - Monotheist, Iron Maiden - A Matter of Life and Death (bruce still got it, baby), choir of dogs barking christmas songs\u000a  \u000a2010 - Pathfinder - Beyond the Space, Beyond the Time, Sabaton - Coat of Arms.  At the Edge of Time was the best PM album that year.  Non PM - Alcest - Écailles de Lune AoTY for me.  \u000a  \u000a2015 - This year is going to be much stronger than 2010 and Beyond the Red Mirror doesn't have anything as good as Wheel of Time. \u000a\u000a  \u000a
p8624
aVSome good stuff on there. Some of the bands on there were in my short list. \u000a\u000aI was stuck on 1989 so just went with BG.\u000a\u000a1992 - I had Images and Words and Fear of the Dark on shortlist but went with BG because The Bards Song is probably the greatest thing ever to sing at Wacken.\u000a\u000a1995 - Imaginations is my favourite BG album so it was going to win whatever year it was in.\u000a\u000a1998 - I was disappointed Rhapsody was this year as I wanted to give them a mention. \u000a\u000a2002 - I defaulted to Night at the Opera because I couldn't really think of anything else at the time.\u000a\u000a2006 - I would probably give it to Dragonland but Twist in the Myth holds a special place in my heart because I met my wife when BG were touring that album.\u000a\u000a2010 - At the Edge of Time was awesome.\u000a\u000a2015 - Not over yet.\u000a\u000a

asVBlind Guardian - Beyond The Red Mirror (Official Album Stream)
p8660
(lp8661
VThe Throne, Grand Parade, and Prophecies are all masterpieces. I think this album might be their best, only second to nightfall.
p8662
aV"Sacred Mind" as well. And "The Holy Grail". And "At the Edge of Time". And "The Ninth Wave". 
p8663
aVPretty much the whole album is really really good, At the Edge of Time is my favorite song on it.
p8664
aVAgreed (on the first sentance; "Sacred Mind" is personally my favorite). Except for maybe "Miracle Machine". It's a bit... okay. Doesn't do much for me. But I understand why they wanted a short slow song before the epic finale. 
p8665
aVMiracle Machine sounds like Touched by the Crimson King Hansi decided to revisit The Eldar. Needless to say, I love it.
p8666
aVThere was one song off the album that reminded me of something from Demons &amp; Wizards. I don't remember which, but that might have been it. 
p8667
aVAt the Edge of the Time is definitely my favourite song on it also.\u000a\u000aI also enjoyed Twilight if the Gods, The Throne and the Holy Grail
p8668
aVAs much as I enjoy and appreciate this, I have no idea why they would put the whole thing on Youtube so soon after the album's release.
p8669
aVPromotion &amp; marketing. It's a little surprising that Nuclear Blast would do this, since they tend to squash youtube posts of their music, but it's nice to see them trying out streams.
p8670
aVI'm glad they did it, since although my Earbook had arrived at home already, I was away all week and this allowed me to give a first few listens.
p8671
aVI never really got the blind guardian circlejerk but this album is amazing.
p8672
aVTheir music has a lot of small details that keeps it feeling freash after many re-listens.
p8673
aVIt took me a really long time to figure out these guys, but I've had a similar realization in recent times.  Listening to their albums is a lot like listening to prog for me -- it takes several listens before I can really "get" it, partially just because there's so much going on in their music.  
p8674
aVI 100% agree with you.  Even this new album, after loving this band, I feel like the drums are fucked sounding.  They may be growing on me after listening.
p8675
aVThere's a Blind Guardian circlejerk? What? Where? When? Huh?
p8676
aVWhat an amazing, gloriously epic album from the bards! Next week we'll kick off official album discussions with it.\u000a\u000aIn the mean time, here's my Blind Guardian (main) album rankings since people have been doing that recently:\u000a\u000a1. Nightfall in Middle-earth\u000a2. A Night at the Opera\u000a3. At the Edge of Time\u000a4. Imaginations from the Other Side\u000a5. Beyond the Red Mirror\u000a6. A Twist in the Myth\u000a7. Somewhere Far Beyond\u000a8. Tales from the Twilight World\u000a9. Follow the Blind\u000a10. Battalions of Fear
p8677
aVMy list would be the same, except to have one and two switched, and that's just because Night at the Opera was the first power metal I'd ever heard, so it has a special place in my heart. Also, I'd probably put Twist in the Myth lower. Besides *Fly* and *Skalds and Shadows*, I find it a boring album. 
p8678
aVAwesome, I was going to make a post about a discussion of the new album (wouldn't have been till Monday/Tuesday) but good thing I held off.
p8679
aV1. Nightfall in Middle-earth\u000a1. At the Edge of Time\u000a1. Imaginations from the Other Side\u000a1. Somewhere Far Beyond\u000a1. A Night at the Opera\u000a1. Beyond the Red Mirror\u000a1. Tales from the Twilight World\u000a1. Follow the Blind\u000a1. A Twist in the Myth\u000a1. Battalions of Fear\u000a\u000awould be my ranking. Haven't given Red Mirror a final verdict yet, was a bit underwhelmed on my first listening, but will give it a few more listenings this week.
p8680
aVMy ranking is very different.  \u000a  \u000a1. Somewhere Far Beyond  \u000a2. The Forgotten Tales (I know, not a traditional "studio album", but it's so incredibly good. "To France" especially).  \u000a3. Battalions of Fear  \u000a4. Nightfall in Middle-Earth  \u000a5. A Night at the Opera  \u000a6. Imaginations from the Other Side  \u000a7. Tales from the Twilight World  \u000a8. A Twist in the Myth  \u000a9. Follow the Blind  \u000a  \u000aAnd those are all the ones I own, so I'm not gonna cover the other ones :)
p8681
aVVinyl should be here today, I cringed seeing this on the tracking info:\u000a\u000a&gt; A late UPS trailer arrival has caused a delay. We're adjusting plans to deliver your package as quickly as possible. / Delivery will be rescheduled. \u000a\u000a...but the weather has been shitty - still, I'm so fucking excited even though I've already listened to it a bunch.\u000a\u000aAs far as rank is concerned, it's in the same spot in my list, but the rest is a little different:\u000a\u000a1. Nightfall in Middle-Earth (no explanation needed)\u000a\u000a2. Tales from the Twilight World (mostly because of my favorite BG song, The Last Candle, but the rest of the album is also excellent)\u000a\u000a3. A Night at the Opera (the change in style worked, this album is almost perfect)\u000a\u000a4. At the Edge of Time (whereas bands tend to get weaker over time, I thought this one kicked a ton of ass)\u000a\u000a5. Beyond the Red Mirror (see previous note, add four more years... may eventually swap with AtEoT)\u000a\u000a6. Somewhere Far Beyond (title track, Time What is Time and the Bard's Songs keep this above the rest - also has the cover of Queen's Spread Your Wings, which I thought was excellent)\u000a\u000a7. Imaginations from the Other Side (this was actually the first album I heard by BG - definitely good, but not better than any of the previous, imo)\u000a\u000a8. Follow the Blind / Battalions of Fear / A Twist in the Myth (hard to rank these last three, so I'm keeping them tied for now)\u000a\u000aEdit: Honorable Mention: Imaginations Through the Looking Glass, one of the best (if not *the best*) live albums I've ever heard.  What I wouldn't give/do to have been at this show - I don't even want to admit to a lot of it, it gets a little dark...
p8682
aVAm I the only one who hears a lot of Demons and Wizards in this album? Especially in Miracle Machine.
p8683
aVHansi definitely takes a D&amp;W approach at times - it's not super prevalent, but it does have a presence. [I also noted the D&amp;W vocals on Miracle Machine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerMetal/comments/2us6l8/blind_guardian_beyond_the_red_mirror_official/cobf401) I actually think this is the album that Hansi has the most variety in his style, as there's callbacks to most of the stages of his development as a vocalist, and there's plenty of new stuff from him in it as well.
p8684
aVWasn't too excited by the single, but really refreshing to hear the Ninth Wave.
p8685
aVI just went through my first listen. So far my fav's are The Ninth Wave, At the Edge of Time, Distant Memories, and Miracle Machine. I think Miracle Machine could have been the best song on the album if at least the chorus was backed up by heavy instrumentation; the chorus is so good! 
p8686
aVI love the album, but I find the production quality to be a bit hit or miss, which is a tad disappointing. \u000a\u000aNot sure what I'm talking about? Grab some good headphones and listen to "Prophecies" or "The Throne" then listen to "Grand Parade" or "Sacred Mind". It's almost like 2 different studios did the audio engineering. 
p8687
aVThe new album is amazing! The bards never disappoint! My favorite songs are Prophecies, At The Edge of Time, Twilight of the Gods, Distant Memories and Holy Grail. Ninth Wave, The Throne and Sacred Mind are good too. The only tracks I haven't been able to get into yet (on my third listen) are Ashes of Eternity, Miracle Machine, and Grand Parade.
p8688
aVNot like the old Blind Guardian, but still great. As I have bought the LP, the art on the picture disc is amazing too. Not many bands are that dedicated to get these things right too.
p8689
aVNew album is fantastic and secures the second place on the list. I never thought that would happen.\u000a\u000a1. Somewhere Far Beyond\u000a2. Beyond The Red Mirror\u000a3. Tales From The Twilight World\u000a4. Imaginations From The Other Side\u000a5. At The Edge Of Time\u000a6. Nightfall In Middle-Earth\u000a7. Battalions Of Fear\u000a8. A Twist In The Myth\u000a9. A Night At The Opera\u000a10. Follow The Blind

p8692
aVDoes Savage Circus still exist?\u000a\u000aI never listened to Persuader. Will look into that. Thanks!
p8693
aVForget about it. Just try to outlive the fact it's impossible to swim two times in the same river - river has changed, you have changed. Try to get band's new staff or look for other bands.\u000a\u000aAnd, man, just listen the album accurately. It full of jewels (several ships to be honest), but not a background music type. A bit hard to get it, but your work will be awarded by tsumamy of ear orgasms.\u000a\u000aIf you like old BG, there are classy Holy Grail and the Throne and Distant Memories and Sacred Mind.

p8705
aVNight Witches is absolutely amazing too.
p8706
aVIt is, I love that song, but its most memorable part isn't really a chorus.
p8707
aVFor me it's the opening up until the first verse begins. The change in intensity is so good.
p8708
aVYup.\u000aI wonder if there's a proper name for what "From the dephs of hell in silence" is. Prelude and epilogue, perhaps?
p8709
aVI just refer to that as the intro and outro because those are the only times they're used
p8710
aVI think I know the part you mean:\u000a\u000a"But when captured by the Axis,\u000a\u000aAnd forced to tell the truth,\u000a\u000aWe'll tell it with a smile,\u000a\u000aWe will surprise them with a laugh..."
p8711
aVI meant the most memorable part of Night Witches isn't a chorus, but the intro and outros. I find the chorus of Resist and Bite to be its most memorable part. Despite the songs specific story about a unit in Belgium, I think the chorus rings true in cases of a hopeless but valiant defence throughout the war.
p8712

aVWhen I first listened to Inhuman Rampage, I wasn't quite sold on Dragonfroce in those first 7 minutes. The next 7 sealed the deal on this track.
p8715
aVThe Soulforged by Blind Guardian is hands down my favorite. So catchy, so empowering, so fucking awesome. 
p8716
aVOh my god, I was obsessed with this song when I was 15-17. I still think its one of the best songs I've ever heard (although IMO it was one of their weaker albums).\u000a\u000aIn fact, its been a while....
p8717
aVI agree!  There are the lines "Still born, but you're still alive, you're still alive!  Truth lies in loneliness, when hope is long gone by" which I find super fantastic.  It helped me whenever I was feeling sad or angry or something, because no matter what I was going through I was at least alive, you know?  
p8718

aVSince Father Time is already picked, I'll go with [Victoria's Secret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUszotxuwGo), especially the final one where it's getting really bombastic.

p8729
aVI've never been a big fan of Hammerfall but i totally love their new album. And this song is magnificent! (I really like this word, magnificent)

aVCONFUTATIS MALEDICTIS
p8737
aVHelloween's ["Future World"](http://youtu.be/_9h3jRaZyB4). Easily one of the corniest choruses (hell, corniest *songs*) ever written, but when you're drunkenly singing along with a bunch of other equally drunk Helloween fans it's straight magical.
p8738
aVThat's a damn classic.
p8739

p8752
aVLoves me some Acid Rain chorus. 
p8753
aVMy first thought was immediately The Things We Believe In, it's just so catchy and melodic.
p8754
aVHeavenly does the best job of cranking out fantastic choruses - [Virus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6ZJP1QyeBo) is probably my top one from them.

aVHaven't had the time to listen to the entire album, but what I've heard so far sounds promising to say the least. 
p8782
aVI love Visigoth, but I almost feel like the EP/demo versions are better suited to their sound.  The album is a little over-polished production wise and the vocals are too buried in the mix.\u000a\u000aStill, it is a solid offering.

p8786
aVI am pretty god damn excited, these guys are from like 10 minutes away from my hometown. Closest thing I have to a Sonata Arctica from my region.
p8787
aVI am really digging this, hope it's just as cracking as Fall From Grace, but by the sounds of it, it probably will!
p8788
aVI hear a little bit of Savatage in this one!
p8789
aVDid anyone else think the vocals sounded not great? Borealis is one of my favourite bands (both albums probably rank in my top 20 albums ever), but I'm definitely worried. Everything other than the vocals sounded great, and I'm sure I'll grow to love those, but this is one of those albums where my expectations are so high, that I'll end up disappointed no matter how it turns out.
p8790
aVNope, they sounded exactly the same as before. Sounds like their live singing.
p8791
aVReally? I've seen them live 5 times and think he sounds better than this. It's mostly just that his voice (particularly in the first part with vocals) sounded incredibly processed. It reminded me of comparing the first Skull Fist album to the second one. I grew into like Jackie's voice on the second SF album, but it was definitely not as raw as before.
p8792

aVI believe the mod team want to open it up for revision at some point given a number of times it's been mentioned.
p8804
aVYep, that will be coming in a few weeks unless one of you guys (mods) wants to start it earlier.
p8805
aVI'm fine with waiting.  I'm so swamped with school work right now I couldn't start it if I wanted to. 
p8806
aVIt makes me cringe every time I see it. 
p8807
aVpls mushmancat you just don't like it because it has a Sabaton album on.
p8808
aVThere are certainly things I would add (Angra), but almost every album in there is a classic in the genre and definitely deserving of its spot.
p8809
aVAfter listening to Heroes, I personally think it should replace Primo Victoria. That or Carolus Rex at the very least should replace it. 
p8810
aVHeoroes while good seems like Sabatons weakest work, since Metalizer. I do agree with Carlous Rex replacing Primo Victoria their best album imo.

aV/r/epicmetal /r/progmetal\u000a\u000aNever stop searching for enjoyable music
p8812
aVDon't forget to check \u000aGamma Ray (e.g. "Land of the free" )\u000aHelloween\u000aAvantasia\u000aDreamtale (e.g. "Epsilon")\u000aDo you ever heard about Nightwish?
p8813
aVCheck out Rhapsody of Fire.
p8814
aVStay awhile and listen
p8815
aVtry sonata arctica :)
p8816
aVYou are in for a treat! In particular I'd say to listen to Nightfall by Blind Guardian the whole way through if you can. The album is an amazing experience
p8817
aVGreat, glad you have discovered the genre, I highly recommend listening to Demons &amp; Wizards as well if you are a big fan of Iced Earth and Blind Guardian, it is a side project with 2 albums by the vocalist for Blind Guardian and the lead guitarist of Iced Earth.
p8818
aVEdguy, Helloween, Avantasia, Sonata Arctica\u000a\u000aTry these bands out
p8819
aVTry Helloween, Edguy, Avantasia, and Masterplan as well.
p8820
aV***We have such sights to show you...***
p8821
aVJust wait till you discover the good bands this genre has to offer. \u000a\u000aAlso, while not as aggressive as Guardian or Iced Earth, Crystallion's Hundred days album is about Napoleon.

aVWell this is out of left field. What the hell have I said in those two posts that is abrasive and rude?  What kind of fucking cupcakes and rainbows world do you live in where me saying "of the bands he listed I only like Blind Guardian" is edgy, rude and abrasive. I guess from now on I should cater my posts for your overly sensitive sensibilities.\u000a\u000a!!!!!!!!TRIGGER WARNING!!!!!\u000a\u000aI don't think Iced Earth is that good. \u000a\u000a\u000aIs that better? Does that meet your standards?\u000a\u000aAnd the irony of you telling me to ignore posts I don't like is heavier than Yob.

aVIced Earth for me was great with Matt Barlow, aside from that meh.

aVI really like Matt Barlow, but the two albums with Stu Block are my favorite Iced Earth albums.

p8834
aVI fail to see the rudeness in his comment, he actually made a good recommendation of a band that he's rather unknown. Maybe he doesn't like Iced Earth, I can't say that I really like Iced Earth, I think their first three albums were excellent (in particular Night of the Stormrider) but everything else they have ever released afterwards as a lot of problems in my opinion.

asVMichael Kiske and Amanda Somerville - City of Heroes (2015)
p8841
(lp8842
VMichael Kiske is such a busy guy! Awesome solo!\u000a\u000aDidn't know Mat Sinner (Primal Fear, Silent Force, Voodoo Circle) and Magnus Karlsson (Primal Fear) were apart of this
p8843
aVMagnus Karlsson is the brainchild behind the first album, and the first Allen-Lande albums. I definitely will be getting the next Kiske-Somerville \u000a\u000a
p8844
aVOnly listened to after the first chorus but it sounds pretty weak to me.
p8845
aVThat's because it is.
p8846
aVI was one of the few people i know that thoroughly enjoyed their last duet album. Im really looking forward to this one! 
p8847
aVI really wasn't a fan but I'll be damned if this isn't catchy as hell!
p8848
aVIt's sounding like everyone has gotten stronger since the last album, especially Kiske and Somerville
p8849
aVHappen to know of any more like it? I somehow never knew about it until last night when I seen this posted, and I'm liking it a lot. And something about this song and Set a Fire make me wanna go run a mile and punch out a bear, I wouldn't mind hearing some similar stuff if I can, since I generally run more in the prog metal than power metal circles.
p8850
aVI know that people might say it has to much pop influence, but man I am a sucker for great duets. \u000a\u000aLoved their 1st album will get the 2nd.\u000a\u000athx for posting
