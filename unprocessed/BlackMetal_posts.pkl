VWhat is Black Metal to you?
p1
VJust curious what this subreddit thought about trends within the genre, more specifically hifi vs lofi recordings and satanic vs non-satanic lyrics and themes. \u000aIs either important or necessary? Hail!

sVLooking for specific recommendations!
p7
VHi, I'm looking for recommendations.  \u000a  \u000aExamples of bands I like: Burzum, Darkthrone (especially Hate Them/Sardonic Wrath), Rotting Christ, Summoning, Ulver, some Ildjarn, Make a Change... Kill Yourself, Mystic Forest/Eikenskaden, Blut Aus Nord, first Immortal album and more.  \u000a  \u000a**Some things I am interested in:**  \u000a - Lyrics about solitude, love/loss, emptiness, nature, regret, pain etc... Basically more introspective/personal as opposed to satanic, aggressive, or evil.  \u000a - Focus on melody and ambience  \u000a - Synthesizers (complimentary like Burzum, Summoning, or Isengard, not at the forefront like Dimmu Borgir)  \u000a - Bands who sound original or unique  \u000a - Bands with either raw or clean production and sound  \u000a - Bands that potentially use industrial/electronic elements (I am a big fan of Ulver's later electronic work, and Mysticum's electronic elements for example)  \u000a  \u000a**Some things I am not interested in:**  \u000a - Anything with mostly blastbeats, or blastbeats faster than the average Fenriz/Vikernes 'half speed' blastbeat  \u000a - Anything that is overly angry, satanic (as in Gorgoroth satanic, not Darkthrone satanic), or based around shock value  \u000a - Anything that focuses too much on viking lyrics or image   \u000a - Anything that focuses more on pummeling as opposed to melody and ambience.  \u000a - Anything overly 'folky'  \u000a\u000a**Thank you very much if you take the time to give me some recommendations!**

sVI'm in a one-man black metal project, would love some second opinions on my music
p43
VI know it's crappy to advertise like this, but I'm not doing it for any sort of monetary gain. I've been working towards getting a one-manned black metal project up and running for a while, and long story short; I'm happy to say I've done it. It's not traditional black metal, but still, the point is; I'd like you guys to check it out. The song I've finished is totally free to download, I just want some feedback is all. I'm working towards an E.P. (which will be free as well), and I'd like some second opinions on my sound. Thanks, guys.\u000aLink: https://soundcloud.com/orestappedinarnage/children

sVNew Diagnose:Lebensgefahr Material
p49
VIn an update a few days ago to the [official site of Nattramn](http://humanianimaliliberati.com/), musician behind such projects as Silencer and Diagnose:Lebensgefahr, a new edition of the 2007 album "Transformalin" was announced.\u000a\u000aIncluded in this vinyl edition are 3 new songs, which were recorded alongside Transformalin but never made the cut to the final album:\u000a\u000a* "Utsikt Ifrån Botten", which translates to "View from the Ocean's Floor", is the first song written under Diagnose:Lebensgefahr, and carries Silencer-like aspects to it. You can hear part of this song when visiting the [official Diagnose:Lebensgefahr site](http://www.diagnoselebensgefahr.com/).\u000a\u000a* "Obducenten Har Vaknat", which translates to "Mortician's Awakening", is the counterpart to the song ["Obducentens Dröm", or "Mortician's Dream"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t76p6MHyGl0).\u000a\u000a* "När Livet Slås Sönder", which translates to "As Life is Smashed to Pieces", is the other new track on the album. Little information is given on the actual site.\u000a\u000aOnly 500 copies of the album are currently on sale, and I was wondering if anyone on this sub had ordered a copy. I'd certainly be interested in hearing the new tracks, as a big fan of the original Transformalin.

VI've been looking everywhere for another band with similar vocal's and guitarwork to [Svarttjern] (http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AZNziX5sL_k), and Ragnarok comes closest. I've found a whole shit-ton of great lesser known band's while I've searched, but I have yet to find more than one other band similar to Svarttjern's style. Anyone have any recommendations?Svarttjerns vocals and guitarwork are just fucking apocalyptical.

VI'm probably going to be downvoted to hell for this, but I was wondering if any of you know of any "acoustic black metal" bands. I ask because I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPIpGPBWLoA) of a Keep of Kalessin guitarist playing an acoustic rendition of one of their tracks. Personally, I think it sounds really fucking cool. \u000a\u000aI also teach a guitar class at a local school, and I think this would be a neat way to expose my students to music they otherwise wouldn't hear, since I'm sure their parents wouldn't be too stoked about me exposing their middle-schoolers to black metal lol.\u000a\u000aThanks for any help, guys!

I will do what I can do so that you're not getting the same old same old.There will still be some additional nocturnal poisoning merch, for example a 'stealing from the poor' shirt, maybe an album reissued on vinyl, but the NP merch will decrease and mostly newer Xasthur merch will increase. The next xasthur full length will be in 2016." \u000a\u000a - Via Nocturnal Poisoning's Facebook page\u000a\u000a \u000aEdit: The new album will NOT be traditional Xasthur, but instead will be Nocturnal Poisoning material under the name Xasthur.

sVI need some recommendations
p309
VSo, I've dedicated February to getting to know black metal, a genre that I never really got into. \u000a\u000aIt all started with Enslaved - Havenless. From there I kind of took the historical approach and started with Mayhem, Burzum, Bathory etc. \u000a\u000aGoing from Wikipedia and the blackest list in the side bar of this sub, I've about covered the early scene, the large influential bands and a lot of the current large names. \u000a\u000aSo here's where I need help. There is *a lot* of black metal to listen to and I need some guidance. \u000a\u000aMy favorite albums so far are:\u000a\u000a**Enslaved - Below the Lights** - This is one of the greatest albums I've ever heard. It's evil, it's technical and it's playful. Holy shit. I dislike their later albums. Clean vocals is not my thing. \u000a\u000a**Taake - Doedskvad** - This is black metal I could get drunk to. It's aggressive and fun, but tight as shit. \u000a\u000a**Dissection - Storm of the Light's Bane** - The exact right amount of melodic \u000a\u000a**Burzum - Filosofem** - A bit slower and more evil than I think I prefer, but I don't believe I have to defend Varg's skills as a composer \u000a\u000aBonus: **Kvelertak - Kvelertak** - This isn't really black metal, but there are winks and nods. I love metal that can have a bit of fun with its genre (have I come to the wrong place? :) \u000a\u000aOf any of you have some recommendations from outside The Blackest List based on this, I would love to hear them. \u000a\u000aThanks!

VI went to see Revenge, Watain, and Mayhem last night at Webster Hall in NYC. Wasn't really expecting much since I never was a big fan of Mayhem, and had never heard of Revenge - a Canadian band - and frankly didn't like them all that much anyway. I also mostly listen to more chilled out bm (e.g. Drudkh), most of whom are disbanded, dead, incarcerated, don't tour, or don't tour the US. But I really wanted to see a BM show. \u000a\u000aWatain took the stage and killed it. The front row definitely got hit with some red colored liquid - no idea what it was.  Put on a relatively long set and was definitely the highlight of the evening for me. \u000a\u000aMayhem was pretty good, but just didn't live up to what what Watain put on, IMO.

sVLooking for recommendations of numinous "dark metal" kind of sound
p477
VDefinition of the numinous has something to do with the intimation of spectrality in negative space.. can be literally a ghost or not \u2026 the monolith from 2001 is a weird example , another weird example is the band Offspring who have often had very paranormal themes to their music , I know just about everyone here wouldn't call them metal but nor would many of you classify Blue Oyster Cult as metal neither and I think there is something seriously wrong with that, Black Sabbath is not a metal band but predominantly a stoner band. I'd say Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is their most metal album, along with Dio's stuff, but most of it not so much. It's not a style of music to me but something thematic . It's not *about* vikings either. Says something about missing the forest for the trees? That'd characterize my feelings about most black metal out there. \u000a\u000aBands like,\u000a\u000aBethlehem -- Dark Metal\u000a\u000aEvergrey -- In Search of Truth\u000a\u000aParadise Lost -- Icon\u000a\u000aKrohm -- A World Through Dead Eyes \u000a\u000aEvoken -- Quietus \u000a\u000aSamael, Tiamat, Rotting Christ, stuff on Century Media records has a lot of this . If I was to be really picky I'd say that Agalloch is not a black metal band but a folk band, but that Ulver is firmly black metal in terms of chilling effect .  A lot of Offspring's music has quite a spooky vibe to it and I think they're a very misunderstood band, far more metal than they ever were a punk or hardcore band. It's not really the style of music I go for but the sound or the theme .

sVDoes Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?
p483
VHey guys, I've long wondered how DSO gets their drums, since they don't credit a drummer (or anyone) and the metal archives doesn't list a drummer for them either. I've heard the argument that their drums are unplayable, but I don't buy that at all -- they're challenging but there are a host of drummers out there in today's metal scene who could learn that stuff in a day. And they've never really sounded synthetic to me, until yesterday when I was listening to 'Drought' and specifically on the track 'The Crackled Book of Life' where you can just hear the drums and the choir, they sound very programmed to me. In particular the cymbals, which have that characteristic Drumkit From Hell sound (especially when played rapidly one after another). I've never wanted to believe they used a drum machine, and I was skeptical before, but now I'm wondering if it's all programmed. If so, it's skillfully done, and you can't argue with the end result... but it's a shame.\u000a\u000aAnyway just wondering if anyone else had thoughts on this.\u000a\u000aEDIT: link to the exact part I'm talking about. Pay attention to the cymbals in particular. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=renZtnPZlFU#t=183

p551
VWell, the time is upon us. Some of you have longed for it, others have dreaded it; to some of you this is coming out of the blue. Uniting you all, however, is your obligation to abide it: the /r/blackmetal blacklist. The deciding factors are two, and they are as simple as can be: if it's a black metal band and it has more than 100,000 listeners on [last.fm](http://www.last.fm), posting their songs are hereby forbidden.* The list is dynamic and subject to change without warning at any time.\u000a\u000aThe reason? It should be obvious enough, but in the interest of thoroughness I'll spell it out: posting eminent mainstays of the genre adds nothing to the community. As you'll notice if you peruse past posts, songs by the likes of Bathory, Mayhem, Darkthrone, etc. will receive a large number (30+) of upvotes, and will often receive zero comments, or if they do, they will be fluff like "classic!" or something similarly vacuous. This community was never intended to be a museum of black metal, nor even an archive. Its purpose is the elucidation of the darker regions of the genre where those with a pre-existing familiarity with it can share and interact with like cohorts. For newcomers to black metal, the blacklist will serve the dual purpose of a gateway to the genre, much as /r/metal 's does for that community. \u000a\u000aThe list will be officially added to the sidebar shortly, but in the meantime it comprises the following bands:\u000a\u000aMayhem\u000a\u000a\u000aEmperor\u000a\u000a\u000aDarkthrone\u000a\u000a\u000aImmortal\u000a\u000a\u000aBurzum\u000a\u000a\u000aSatyricon\u000a\u000a\u000aDark Funeral\u000a\u000a\u000aMarduk\u000a\u000a\u000a1349\u000a\u000a\u000aBathory\u000a\u000a\u000aBehemoth\u000a\u000a\u000aBorknagar\u000a\u000a\u000aUlver\u000a\u000a\u000aCarpathian Forest\u000a\u000a\u000aEnslaved\u000a\u000a\u000aDimmu Borgir\u000a\u000a\u000aAgalloch\u000a\u000a\u000aGorgoroth\u000a\u000a\u000aCradle of Filth\u000a\u000a\u000aAlcest\u000a\u000a\u000aDissection\u000a\u000a\u000aShining\u000a\u000a\u000aSummoning\u000a\u000a\u000aRotting Christ\u000a\u000a\u000aOld Man's Child\u000a\u000a\u000aSamael\u000a\u000a\u000aArcturus\u000a\u000a*New releases (up to one week after official release date) excepted.\u000a\u000aFeel free to use the comment section to:\u000a\u000a* Bemoan the fascist mods\u000a\u000a* Make suggestions -- as in, of bands to add to the list\u000a\u000a* Make your case against the instatement of the list, which as you might surmise, will be of little consequence\u000a\u000a* Grumble amongst yourselves.\u000a\u000aUltimately, we feel this is a benefit to the community and your experience with it. \u000a\u000aBenevolently dictatorial regards,\u000a\u000athe /r/blackmetal moderators.\u000a\u000aP.S., someone who knows CSS better than "not at all" will be along shortly to tidy up the list. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

sVGreetings, I'm looking to expand my musical tastes into Black Metal
p790
VIn my teenage years I developed a love for metal. Anything I could get my hands on I would listen to. That stopped over the years as I found hip-hop (Aesop Rock, Eyedea, Brother Ali, El-P, so on and so forth) and fell out of the metal scene for quite some time. Feeling nostalgic I decided to listen to Cradle of Filth's song "Babalon A.D." and immediately remembered my love for the genre. I was wondering, and I'm sorry if there is some sort of post I over-looked, if you guys could help me find bands like them? \u000a\u000aThe thing that I loved about Cradle of Filth were how melodic/symphonic their compositions were. With Dani Filths amazing highs and the backing of female vocals on some tracks, mixed with crazy drums and dark riffs, and the lyricism (well, the few things I could understand anyway) absolutely made them a powerhouse in my opinion. I understand they fell off years ago in terms of musicality and and whatnot, but albums like Midian and Damnation and a Day remain some of my favorite albums of any genre. \u000a\u000aSorry for getting lost, the point is, could any of you help me find bands that are similar? Thank you for your time.

sVQuestion about Black Metal genre
p825
VI rarely listen to Black Metal since I don't like the depressing feel I get after listening to it after a while.\u000a\u000aBUT. I heard this absolutely **EPIC** sort of Black Metal song. And I'm curious if this is a sub genre or you know more songs like that, so here it goes: The song I heard lasted very long, the screaming was constant, very raspy and ongoing. There was some kind of flute instrument played. The guitar played long outdrawn power-chords almost exclusively, and the drumming was extreme and intense. It gave me a chilling feeling I very rarely get when listening to music, and I listen to lots of different music. But this song just gave me a sensation of feeling like I was back in time where there was Vikings and Dragons out in the wilderness. It was the most athmospheric music I've probably heard in my life. So PLAESE can someone tell me what this may have been?\u000a\u000a(Yeah I know its a long question, but I NEED to know because It gaves me chills all the way till the end and I really want to listen to more lik this) Thanks.

p855
VI usually stick up for Liturgy a lot more than most people I know in the scene do, and I really enjoyed most of their work (I liked Renihilation and their split with Oval and I liked a couple songs on Aesthetica) but [this song's total wank](\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebxIwwhV5MA). Their new album is coming out in March and to be completely honest I went from being slightly excited for it to not giving a shit. \u000a\u000aI don't know if there's much of a discussion worth talking about here because I'm not sure if there's any more discussion worth having about it, but if there is anyone around who enjoyed this new song, please help me out, I'm not getting it.

VHi everyone. I'm sorry if this is against the rules, but I saw nothing against these types of posts in the rules. I also made this a self-post so I won't get any karma.\u000a\u000aAnyways, I've been working on an archive of some of my favourite Black Metal albums in the past few months. I still have a lot of albums to add, but it's pretty updated. Many of the albums are fairly underground and/or underrated, so I'm sure everyone here can discover at least one new Black Metal album. There's a stickied post at the top, explaining some things about the subreddit. Also, the newest post on the sub gives a bit of info about what's happened to it recently (Summary: I'm looking for moderators.)\u000a\u000aI encourage you to leave a comment on an album you enjoy, or maybe send me some recommendations. I'd like to help people discover new music, so I figured this would be the best place to do it.\u000a\u000aHave a great day, and I hope you enjoy. Here's the sub: /r/BlackMetalArchive
