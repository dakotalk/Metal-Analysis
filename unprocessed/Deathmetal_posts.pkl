VAn example would be [Desultor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts6vFKbbCjY), a band labeled on the metal-archives as technical death metal. Some people would argue that they're not death metal, but, well, those people would be wrong.\u000a\u000aDon't mistake me, I LOVE death metal with growled vocals, but sometimes it's nice to have a change of pace. \u000a\u000aEDIT: Progressive death that alternates clean vocals with growls in a "copying Opeth" style is cheating. Ergo, no Opeth, no The Faceless, no Black Crown Initiate, etc. \u000a\u000aEDIT2: Why the fuck would you downvote this post? The fuck, /r/deathmetal?

VA few years ago I stumbled across a youtube video which showcased various songs from several lesser known old school death metal bands. One of these songs began with what sounded like medieval or monk-like chanting followed by an awesome old-school death metal sound, and I can't for the life of me remember the name of the song.\u000a\u000aThe title of the song and band has eluded me for several years and it's been driving me nuts.

I'm finding something very generic. Or some goat grunting about how he screwed some dead dumpster fetuses or something. (In other words silly lyrics) I guess I just haven't really found a entry point. I would start with the old stuff. Yet I don't really know any bands or the history. Im fine with any genre or subgenre of Death metal. So far I have enjoyed. Abysmal Dawn. Immolation. Death and Soulburns new album. Dont know if these are good but hey. I like them. I like when the songs are able to progress. Flow. Add a lot of ideas and elements but staying on the more "thunderous" side like Immolation. I would greatly appreciate it if you guys could help.

The majority of the day after the show I was not sore at all. Then as soon as I got off work that night my shoulder started to hurt and by the time I was driving home I started having trouble breathing. Now my entire left shoulder blade and back is killing me anytime I take a step, breathe deep, or move either arm. I am open to any suggestions to stop this hell.

sVAsian Death Metal
p215
VAsian death metal is awesome. I'm an Australian playing in an otherwise all-Japanese brutal death band, Pukelization. I've linked our soundcloud. I'm gonna offer my opinion on the scenes I'm aware of in Asia and suggest some bands. \u000a\u000aIndonesia in particular is undoubtedly the hidden metal capital of the world. Strangely, brutal death metal has almost been absorbed into the mainstream economy. Many government officials support brutal death metal events which have major sponsors such as Marlboro. Indonesian death metal fests must be among the biggest and most frequent. You can view high quality filmed events of local Indonesian death metal. Indonesian death metal scene is quite self sufficient due to its size, many bands dont need to travel internationally. In the streets you can identify many metal fans. I would suggest listening to Asphyxiate and Demigod from Indonesia.\u000a\u000aPhilippines has a flourishing metal scene. Metal is much more underground here, but is getting healthier due to the hard work of local promoters like 'Insane Bazooka' putting on shows and drawing Asian internationals. Philippines have a wide range of metal but seem to favour brutal slam. Philippines has a great hardcore &amp; punk scene as well. I once attended a show in the south and a government official was in attendance, when police came to shit it down, he allowed the show to go on. From Philippines check out Down from the Wound, Human Mastication, The Deadflesh Architect, Mass Hypnosia and more.\u000a\u000aVietnam has a young metal scene which is working very hard to grow and doing a great job. Vietnam seems to have a wide range of metal and metalcore. Vietnam metal shows tend to start early in the afternoon, as VN has strict laws about noise after 10pm. The scene is supported by blogs and social media promoters like Saigon Metal Group and Vietnam Hardcore. Metalcore seems to be the big one here but all metal can be found. Check out Brutore, Multiplex, Cruel Society, SagoMetal and more.\u000a\u000aTaiwan I have been just one time but heres my impression. Seems like deathcore is really big in Taiwan. Entering the rehearsal studios of Taiwan I can see the posters and merchandise for many local deathcore bands on the walls. They also have some death metal. We were brought across by Revilement, awesome technical death metal band. Check out Revilement, Beyond Cure and SIDEEFFECT.\u000a\u000aThere are many metal scenes and bands in Asia, and these are just the ones I've been personally. There are also scenes in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and more. Although Ive been to Japan I feel like spotlighting some of the other scenes in this post. Anyway, happy headbanging, enjoy some Asian metal! \u000a\u000aAlso, check out InDarkPurity zine!\u000a

VSo, I consider myself someone who knows his way around the genre(s) pretty well.  I'm typically a brutal death metal fan, but stuff like Belphegor's "Stigma Diabolicum" or Carpathian Forest's "Start Up the Incinerator" move me on an emotional and spiritual level I can't quite explain.\u000a\u000aIn that vein, I'm looking for more stuff like Septic Flesh's "Mechanical Babylon" intro that use very atmospheric tones of worship, almost, in their music.  Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpInrL7uQxM \u000aI like deeper vocals, and already have the vast majority of the basic bands I can think of (The Faceless, Septic Flesh, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Behemoth, Dimmu Borgir, Old Man's Child, one or two tracks of Rotting Christ, you get the picture) and I'm just looking for more atmospheric stuff that puts me in a place of what I can only describe as worship.\u000a\u000aCheers, everybody!

I haven't really listened to [Torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_(album)) and I haven't heard any of there new stuff yet.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a[Behemoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behemoth_(band)) - [Demigod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demigod_(album)), [The Apostasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apostasy), and [The Satanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanist_(album)). I like songs off of their older albums as well but these are my favorites.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI really Like [Beheaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beheaded_(band))'s Elapsed in the Vortex of Extinction but I haven't listend to the rest of [Never to Dawn](http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Beheaded/Never_to_Dawn/354638) yet.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI really like [Fallujah](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Fallujah/3540255104)'s Saphire but I hear all of [The_Flesh_Prevails](http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Fallujah/The_Flesh_Prevails/412147) sounds very similar. I have not listened to it yet.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI like some of [Hypocrisy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy_(band))'s [End of Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_Disclosure) but I can't seem to get into their older work. Maybe I'm not listining to the right albums.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI like a lot of [Morbid Angel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbid_Angel)'s older work but their new album is just god awful. Same with [Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slayer).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI can be more specifc if needed (like listing my favorite songs).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBased on this, recommend some songs/albums/bands that you think I will like.

I apologize for not having more stuff to go off but that's all I can remember.\u000a\u000aEdit: [Found it!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u0AHVpapkA) Thanks for the guesses though.

sVkinda boring
p555
VAm I the only one who became alienated from this music genre?\u000aI mean all of them. I was really into this kind of music in most of my childhood and early adulthood but now I don't feel anything. I started with heavy metal and some of the grand names, then I began my own way. There were some black ones like naglfar but I was really into in death metal like vomitory, fleshcrawl, cryptopsy (old) and so on. The best part was when I first listen to NCC and got to know with grindcore and goregrind. But this time has ended. Whenever I am listening to this, it's just a noisy void. There aren't any good ideas. Whenever a new album come out I can name wich band has already tried similar riffs, tone etc. Kinda boring. \u000aYesterday I gave it a try again and was on a concert but after one hour I gave up. I think I'll take a little break and will see it later.\u000aHas anybody ever got the same?

The later ones have better production value because I got a better understanding on how to mix. \u000a\u000aWould this be something you would enjoy listening to? Is it even death metal? What kind of vocal styles would work best with this type of music? I was thinking of doing thrashy vocals for fast parts and switch to guttural ones for slower instances.\u000a\u000aVocals and soloing are the hardest parts for me, so I'm still working at it. Soon enough, I have a drummer and bassist who will come in so I can move this project out of my bedroom and on to the stage.\u000a

p585
VThis jam has been hitting me hard, lately.  I pursue music for the feelings brings to the surface in me.  I like brutal death for the intensity and visceral human disgust.  I like death metal like Behemoth's "Evangelion" or "Apostasy" for the rage and spirituality, and black metal like Gorgoroth, Carpathian Forest, Horde, or Mayhem for the raw, unfettered spirituality.  Obviously, the lines get blurred amongst the dozen bands I celebrate and experience, but funeral doom generates an entirely unique sensation.  The sorrow, heartache, and general bleakness creates something totally unique.  Besides generally ALL Paramecium, this has become a new favorite.\u000a\u000aRevel in the melancholy:  \u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSSFG_pNPg0\u000a(5:01 is when things get heavy for me).\u000a\u000aYou guys all fucking rock.

VFor me it was Bolt Thrower - Those Once Loyal\u000a\u000aI was new to metal and was listening to crap like Disturbed and such and I asked a friend who is into mostly old school to name some death and thrash metal bands and among the first ones he named was Bolt Thrower. I fell in love and been listening to DM for years now. And In metal I got by purchasing a Rammstein CD by accident.\u000a\u000aAlso, is it just me or did your first few bands decided the sound of DM you like? Ever since I started listening to DM I always preferred war themed DM that is sluggish and heavy with deep growls.

With all the social networks that exist today, I find it hard to believe that there is not even one person that can say "Oh, I have seen him in the supermarket" or whatever.\u000a\u000a\u000aAny help?

V[The Promethean Kings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm0u68qRZ0M&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLPPfvssj9akA5bbVUNJNnETQTm9-Swqo6)-The pinch harmonic work on this one around 1:35 is piercing and awesome. Love this song.\u000a\u000a[The Ophidian Form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqYrZs6EBrM&amp;list=PLPPfvssj9akA5bbVUNJNnETQTm9-Swqo6&amp;index=5)\u000a\u000aI wanted to hear y'alls thoughts on this album if you've listened to it.\u000a\u000aI honestly can't get enough of it. I'm not a huge of symphonic elements sneaking into my metal, but this album is one of few that I'm gladly to make an exception for. Also, I am blown away by the guitar proficiency in this. I don't know of too many metal bands with this same kind of "epic" style that remain so technical. Son of Aurelius is another band that also blends a similar brand of technicality and epicness together pretty flawlessly, but I can't get over how intricate this LP is. There are parts I've had to listen to over and over to discern what each guitarist is doing, conversely there are some tremolo parts that pair with drop tempo with the drums that sound like the earth is being torn in half. This is probably my favorite album this year.

I like the music of old school bands like Obituary and Morbid Angel too but the while the vocals are intelligible it just sounds like someone barking into a microphone. I like deep vocals that sound like part of the song, not just throw on as an afterthought. What should I listen to next?

sVR.I.P. my death metal collection
p872
VSo my HDD suddenly died on me trapping my death metal collection on it. I had 80-90 discographies of mostly lesser known death metal bands. \u000a\u000aSo far I managed to remember over 50 but I can't make myself download all that music again. It's not that it's big but it's really hard to find.\u000a\u000aI feel like a big part of me is missing.\u000a\u000aAnd before someone says that I should buy albums, I would if I had the money. Unfortunately I don't.\u000a\u000aAnd if anyone wants to download an album and can't find it, here's a good torrent site for it: http://en.metal-tracker.com/ \u000a\u000aEdit: I'm sure it's dead and extraction would be over 200 euros which is ridiculous. I just wanted to share my experience and tell you people to always backup your files.\u000a\u000aEdit 2: For all those that call download stealing and us that do it thieves, I sincerely apologise for not living in a country where we make so much money that we can spend it on luxuries like albums or video games or whatever. We will now stop listening to music all together because we're poor.

Even though there isn't much of a chance of people in other subreddits having any clue what the original sounded like.\u000a\u000aSO, if I post them here are you guys going to string me up for it? If so, where do you think I should post them? Some are really too good not to share.

VWasn't sure where to talk about this and since I mostly listen to death metal I figured I'd do it here. You guys only post links so a discussion is always good.\u000a\u000aI've been hearing a lot about djent lately. Some talk about it like its a genre and call themselves djentheads. So are there really people dumb enough to consider djent a genre? It's a sound and not really a good one. What I've heard so far sounds like it's some kind of deathcore/metalcore.\u000a\u000aHere's how it sounds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lai14aOv29M
