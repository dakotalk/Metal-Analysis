VThe only reason I know it exists is because of Ceremony and Trash Talk. I havent heard much from Trash Talk in the last year and a half and Ceremony is Indie all of a sudden? \u000a\u000aI'm looking for something that is heavy, has loads of feedback and is fast.\u000aThen again, I'm not really sure what "true" power violence is, I just thought it was another form of hardcore (Kind of like a derivative, traditional styled bands being like Bane and Have Heart. While you have heavier stuff like Death Threat and Terror.) Though, I think I may be wrong.

Vsomething like the beginning of [this](http://acxdc.bandcamp.com/track/jack-trippin) or [this](http://willowtip.bandcamp.com/track/excommunicated)\u000a\u000abut preferably even faster and more nuts. one without any slow parts / breakdowns. a track that just rips from beginning to end and tears itself apart with raw fury. the longer the better. it can even be instrumental but the only caveat is that i don't want deep gurgling vocals like some grind bands have, i want the screechiest most obnoxious vocals possible. although if it has deep vocals and it's crazy enough it'll work i guess. i'm making a short film and i just need something that will make people unfamiliar with the genre shit their pants in terror

Vlooking for other creeps and nerds to start a powerviolence or a fastcore band with. I play guitar and bass and scream really loud to try and get my point across that life sucks. I'm looking for others specifically drums to jam with. I'm way into all the original bands that you're into but also bands like Iron Lung, Kung fu Rick, and SFN. With that being said, I'm looking to do a weird PV band more in the vein of dystopia with really fast parts and maybe a few odd time signatures in it because fuck you and your bobbing head. Anyway, I have a car and will travel to closer surrounding states to do this so if anyone is interested or know anyone that may be interested let me know. \u000a\u000aHere is a link to some stuff that I've done. \u000astandard PV stuff: https://soundcloud.com/bikesrule/sets/heatstroke-hetfield-demo\u000a\u000aweirder stuff: https://soundcloud.com/bikesrule/when-will-it-end\u000a                   https://soundcloud.com/bikesrule/im-starting-to-pass-out\u000a

VAs many of you know, Fred Phelps, the evil mastermind behind the Westboro Baptist Church, is on his deathbed. In celebration, my label wants to put together a comp, entitled "Fred Phelps: A Tribute." Any grind/powerviolence/anything similar bands that want to tell Fred Phelps to hurry up and die, and probably have the comp sent to his children, write a song lyrically matching the theme, and send it our way. Hoping to get 20 - 40 bands, so don't hesitate to join in the fun.\u000a\u000aHere's the Bandcamp.\u000ahttp://dickcrushrecords.bandcamp.com/\u000aAnd the Facebook.\u000ahttps://www.facebook.com/DICKCRUSHRECORDS\u000a\u000aLet us know on Fartbook or message me here if you want in.\u000aThat old bastard's gonna kick the bucket soon, and I'd like to get a copy to Shirley while it's still fresh, so let's go go go!\u000a\u000aEDIT: I should be more specific with the genres. We'll take anything grind, powerviolence, hardcore, thrash, doom, slam, sludge, even punk rock (although we might be a little picky with that last one). Anything you play that is even similar to those genres is good. Anything one might call "extreme music" will fit right in.

sV'You're Crazy - Volume One' - An anthology of stories from the hardcore punk scene
p636
VYou\u2019re Crazy Volume One compiles twenty-five first-hand accounts of people from the punk scene who live with mental illness, addiction and trauma. This volume also includes two stories of punk rockers who are allies to those of us who struggle and their experience. This book exists to help empower the writers who are sharing their personal experiences so that they can be better understood. It also exists to help show that we are not alone in this world and that life can get better. It\u2019s a necessity in our community. We all deserve to be heard. You\u2019re Crazy aims to help decrease the stigma that the authors, and those like them, face while dealing with mental illness, addiction and trauma. By sharing their stories they are putting themselves on the line as they take ownership of their lives and experiences while demonstrating the reality of their lives. These stories educate and inspire, increasing understanding and empathy while reducing stigma.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/youre-crazy---volume-one/14056453

VHi all. I've recently been commissioned to write an essay on the history and present activity of powerviolence in the international punk community. It will be included as a chapter on a forthcoming volume about punk rock in the 21st century (published by some professors in the UK). I could use your help with suggestions for reliable resources regarding powerviolence. I've been a PV fan for quite a while, but have never seen any kind of literature on the subject (which is part of the intrigue, obviously). Let me know!
