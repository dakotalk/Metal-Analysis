p60
aVIndeed, first band that sprung to mind.
p61
aVKreator as well.  Endless Pain was quite possibly the very first thrash album with guttural vocals.
p62
aVYeah man, Pleasure to Kill comes to mind, too. Any Kreator where Ventor (drummer) sings is also extra gruff.
p63
aVYeah, they did have a "death metal" influence phase. As did Testament, come to think of it.
p64
aVDemolition Hammer. Epidemic of Violence and Tortured Existence are unreal. 
p65
aVThe first Cannibal Corpse album, "Eaten Back to Life" is pretty thrashy, plus has guttural vocals. Not as death metal as Butchered at Birth and beyond.
p66
aVI don't hear that.  Can you post an example of a song from that album that is "pretty thrashy"?
p67
aVNot straight thrash by any means, but the track Mangled, specifically. It has more of a thrash/hardcore punk drum style, and thrash-styled guitar. It sounds that way to me, anyhow. 
p68
aVI see what you mean.  Definitely a hardcore sort of influence there.
p69
aVThe track, "Put Them to Death" also has some thrashy parts to it. Specifically the second half of the song. 
p70
aVSkeletonwitch is considered blackened thrash, and you may want to check out some later Testament. Try "Demonic" if you want a death-y style sound. \u000a\u000aPantera, though, isn't thrash, and if you want "gutteral" like him, then you won't have to look too hard. They're groove metal. 
p71
aVWell, following wikipedia and some "best thrash metal bands/songs" lists, they're thrash. Anyway, thanks I will try those.
p72
aVIt says that about Pantera? That's cute.\u000a\u000aFIRST FOUR ALBUMS ONLY /teasing hardcore fans\u000a\u000aEdit: Also, damn, wow, that Wikipedia page is pitifully badly organized. "Hey, this band has some vaguely thrashy elements ... uh ... chuck them in there". Damn community editing doesn't always work, I suppose.
p73
aVOnly when you have self-professed metalheads whose extent of the genre is focused almost entirely on mainstream metal bands like Pantera.  I don't ever depend on Wikipedia for genres anyway.  The standard there is if someone in a newspaper, magazine, etc. refers to a band as being part of a particular genre, they can be written as such on their page.\u000a\u000aGo to Metal Archives for accurate genre listings.
p74
aVTrue that. I've known about that site and increasingly had to use it here and there over the years, no clue why it's still not a first go-to for my brain most of the time.
p75
aVGod, it's awfully nitpicky to make an entire separate genre classification that basically amounts to "thrashy but slower."  Then again, what's more metal than needless technicality?  \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a.... :D\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI'll see myself out. 
p76
aVNunslaughter and Witchery are some of my favorites.
p77
aVTry toxic holocaust.\u000aThey're a mix with thrash, punk and black metal lirycs.
p78
aVTry Infernäl Mäjesty. Also Num Skull and Dragon (Pol).\u000a\u000aEdit: Oh wait, you said Pantera-Like. Never mind, then. Exhorder it is.
p79
aVPhil Anselmo is not thrash, pretty sure when Pantera was thrash he wasn't very guttural. What do you mean? Once you start singing like Phil Anselmo it stops being thrash.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I'm drunk, so this may be more inflammatory than intended.\u000a\u000aEDIT 2: When Phil Anselmo speaks he sounds EXACTLY like that cockroach dude in human disguise from men in black.\u000a\u000aEDIT 3: Try 'SODOM' they are thrash and pretty guttural. Maybe Sepultura - Beneath The Remains
p80
aV[deleted]
p81
aVHas nobody mentioned GWAR? They're not the guttural-est but neither is Pantera. They definitely have a roughness and intensity that I think you'll find interesting. Also totally seconding Sodom, good stuff.\u000a\u000aBy subgenre definition, thrash music typically (though of course not always) uses a thrash-style harsh vocal, which is often not the same as "growls", depending on the definitions of harsh vocals you use. You'll find some examples that cross over, though. 
p82
aVGWAR isn't fast enough to be thrash but neither is Pantera.  Think Exodus, Overkill, DRI, Anthrax, Testament, Megadeth, Metallica, Exhorder, etc.
p83
aVPantera most certainly isn't thrash, but I disagree with you about GWAR and I disagree that speed is the defining characteristic to consider. Overall speed is a factor, but bands like Megadeth prove that thrashy elements aren't always in the kickin' backbeats and high tempos ... just *mostly*. Edit: I mean, half of my favorite Overkill songs are factually slower than some of my favorite GWAR songs. It just doesn't stand as a criteria ^^I ^^should ^^have ^^said ^^"a ^^sole ^^criterion" ^^here ^^... . Edit edit: I should note that my exposure to GWAR is somewhat cursory so maybe some of their material varies more widely than I'm aware.
p84
aVWell I mean thrash metal got its name from being an offshoot of speed metal.  Speed is absolutely one of the main defining characteristics of thrash metal.  In GWAR's case, most of their music is in the classic metal vein but they are definitely full of thrash elements. Anyway, we're nitpicking here.  I've been banging my head to metal since the 80's and ain't about to stop.  :)
p85
aV*One of* the main defining characteristics, I agree -- it just seemed to me like you were saying it was an essential "yes/no" indicator, know what I mean? But I can tell from your reply here that I read into your comment before a bit too much, and we both agree that it's nitpicky after a point, ha! And well, shit, if there's more traditional heavy in GWAR than I realized, that's just a good reason to go listen to more of it! Thanks for the memo. ;)
p86
aVThe funny thing is that even though I've seen GWAR in concert and thought I knew what I was talking about, after reading your post and went to Youtube and damn if every GWAR tune I randomly picked wasn't fairly straight up thrash LOL

p96
aV Generally, keep in mind that German Thrash is heavier, with harsher vocals. So you've got your classics, like Sodom, Kreator, Destruction, Exumer, Tormentor, Protector, Poison... German Thrash, one of the best style of music ever, look it up.  Then, if you want guttural vocals, you might want to try death/thrash; bands like Merciless, Massacra, Mortal Sin, Morbid Saint, Rigor Mortis, Possessed... And for bands like Pantera, you're looking for groove metal, so try listening to Exhorder, Lamb of God and Warbeast.

VI would say best thrash metal shows i have seen are always going to be at smaller venues that fill up.  This year i was able to catch Havok in one show and Toxic Holocaust in another, both in Brooklyn, NY and had an amazing time.  Was able to meet the band as well.  I have seen bigger acts like Megadeth and Anthrax and had a good time, but the smaller shows are where its at for me.  \u000a\u000a\u000aEdit - Also, as an Ecuadorian...i approve of that fan up front for the big four holding an Ecuadorian Flag that says metallica.  Pretty awesome.  
p154
aVI agree about the smaller shows being better. Skeletonwitch is playing here this month at a little hole in the wall and it's going to be awesome.
p155
aVjealous!  they are playing in NYC next month but in a larger venue for 41 bucks.
p156
aVHoly crap! 41 bucks?
p157
aVI think I'd have to say Megadeth December 22, 1990 on the Rust in Peace tour. I had just turned 15 and it was first real metal show I had been to. It was a place called The Morocco Shrine Auditorium in Jax, FL. It was basically a bingo hall. I still have the ticket stub. http://i.imgur.com/XyVTAdS.jpg\u000a\u000aA close second would probably be Danzig in 1993 on the Danzig 4 tour. I remember Korn opening up for them and no one knew who they were. Marilyn Manson played second, and the drummer passed out in the middle of the show. This resulted in the crowd cheering so they just left the stage and the house played Seasons in the Abyss in it's entirety before Danzig's set. You can imagine how good Slayer sounded after Marilyn Manson. People were moshing and singing to it. At some point during the Danzig set, John Christ threw one of his guitar picks and it ended up on my friend's shoulder. We're not sure how long it was there, but I noticed it just sitting there during a song. It was a pretty cool night.\u000a\u000aMy third favorite show would be Metallica in 1991. My friend won snake pit passes so we got to do the meet and greet and everything. I would have preferred to see them on the Justice tour, but hey, you can imagine how awesome this was for a 15 year old metalhead to be able to go into the snake pit and then meet Metallica. \u000a\u000aSorry for the bad lighting, and they're kind of faded but you can read most of it!\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/qlc18C0.jpg \u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/FlOTwXE.jpg

p159
aVBest thrash concert I've attended was either Kreator or Anthrax both in Melbourne, 2009 and 2013 respectively. Both fucking excellent for different reasons. 
p160
aVSlayer last year in June. It was a small show, only 1300 people. No opening band, only Slayer. It was awesome. I was in the front row, and I even met Tom and Kerry before the show. They put Hanneman's guitar on stage, that was nice. They all played great. No one can replace Hanneman, but Holt was great, full of energy. After the show my friend got a crew member to give him Holt's half-full beer bottle. We also caught setlists.\u000a\u000aIt was the best metal concert I've ever been to. And then I saw Iron Maiden live.\u000a\u000a
p161
aVTie between Biohazard and Fear Factory, both played in very small venues and kicked ass.\u000a\u000aOne thing I remember from the Biohazard show, there was this wasted couple in front of me being more than obnoxious. The dude then climbed a tall stack of speakers and wanted to dive into the crowd and surf. Nobody looked anxious to catch him though and Evan stopped in the middle of a song and told everyone they'd better catch him or they'd walk off the stage. Dude was caught and immediately set on the ground. Someone ended up throwing an elbow up into his eye and so off he stumbled to the exit with his hollering bitch of a gf.

p208
aVDude, fucking [Phantom Limb Masturbation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=had_xt1uccE)... Knight's lead guitar is something like a new take on neoclassical and I will never be able to achieve his stage of vibrato... Absolutely wonderful.

aVJimmy Hedlund of the Swedish power/folk metal band Falconer might be one of the most amazing lead guitarist's I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. I urge all of you to check out his videos on youtube. It's a shame he's not more well known. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAISpV2okNI\u000a\u000aAlso in terms of thrash metal, Jeff Waters and Marty Friedman's stuff with Megadeth.
p212
aVWow spectacular! \u000a\u000aHis stuff kinda reminds me of marty friedman, I can guess the notes before I hear them. Really creative stuff.
p213
aVVernon Reid has always blown my mind.  He was the one who made me pick up the guitar in the first place.  His album solos are literally amazing, but then I started seeing him live, and collecting their live albums.  What sets him apart more than anything, is that he improvises his solos live, at an absolutely incredible level.  It's one thing for a great guitarist to pull off a solo live when they've practiced it note-for-note for dozens of hours and played it the same way hundreds of times.  Vernon is playing mind-blowing solos, completely different every time.  I followed him(Living Colour) for 3 shows and each one was completely different, and at the absolute highest level of musicianship I've ever witnessed.  He's 55 now, and instead of slowing down, he's still getting better and better.\u000a\u000a
p214
aVJari from wintersun, formerly of ensiferum. 
p215
aVRoope Latvala is pretty fantastic if you're looking for interesting sounding kind of solos over killer riffs. Victor Smolski is another great guitarist who takes technical precision to new heights.
p216
aVWhat bands are these dudes from?
p217
aVRoope is from the Finnish band Stone, and I know Victor primarily from his time with Rage; check out their song "Unity".
p218
aVI listen to No Anesthesia! all the time. Such a good album. Had no idea who the guitarist was.\u000a\u000aThanks for the info!
p219
aVI find his solos so creative; not just the usual shredding often found in thrash. He's in Children of Bodom now.
p220
aVJeff Waters has to be one of the best guitarists I've ever seen. Got to sit 5 feet from him during a guitar clinic and he just melts faces. He's super energetic when he's playing and shreds at the speed of light. It kind of annoys me when a guy says "I really pushed my limits when I wrote this one, so don't get super high expectations" and then proceeds to not miss a note and sound better than it does on the album.. My left hand aspires to be his left hand. My right hand aspires to be Jon Schaeffer. His picking with jeffs fretting would be the best thing ever.

p432
aVYeah that's what I was referring to in my first post, sorry if I was unclear.\u000a\u000aI still think the screaming thing is an issue, since lots of "thrash metal" bands use it in a lot of their songs. I know you define thrash differently than I do, but I think if you look at what the community puts on the front page (which I'm sure you do) I think you'll get a good idea of what the majority definition of thrash is, and if people follow this rule, I think it's gonna reallllly cut down the submission rate.
p433
aVThat is why the keyword "consistent" is there. There are plenty of occasional screaming, yelling, shouting, in metal songs. \u000a\u000aBut usually you won't find a thrash metal song that is filled consistently with screaming/growling. It even makes it difficult to hear the music.\u000a\u000aIf I look on the front page on this community, I don't see anyone violating the rules I put on the sidebar. I haven't moderated/deleted/removed a submission in a long long time.\u000a\u000aI'm more concerned about the fact that the community is much more vicious in downvoting (that is affecting our submission-rate), rather than me or moderators moderating too much.
p434
aVWhat about Skeletonwitch or Vektor? The Witch only has Black and Death type vocals and Vektor Black type vocald with some screams. All their songs are without clean vocals.

VSkeletonwitch is the freshest modern thrash that I've ever experienced.
p578
aVI've noticed that nothing... NOTHING... in newer thrash has matched the apocalyptic malevolence of [Darkness Descends era Dark Angel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEWLbgqCkUk). It's a kind of classic evil. Not terribly blasphemous our outrageously heavy, but as evil as it can sound while still being fun. It's lost on newer thrash.\u000a\u000aAs far as being unique, [HeXeN](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTTm1VVkOCQ) doesn't rip too hard off the 80's. It's quite technical too-like a Megadeth/Coroner hybrid.
p579
aVI think most people agree that the majority of thrash bands nowadays just rehash the same old 80s sound, and a lot of it isn't that great.  I still like some of the new wave bands (especially Warbringer).  \u000aIf you like fresh sounding modern thrash, surely you've heard [Vektor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7G7iYCxK9U), no???
p580
aVThe problem is simple. Thrash metal is extremely fucking hard to do well.\u000a\u000aIt's not easy. When I started this subreddit, I expected tons of bands to be able to achieve the same level of melody, rhythm, riffs, solos, technicality, excitement, song structure as famous bands like Megadeth, Metallica, Anthrax. Nope. It's unbelievably rare.\u000a\u000aIt makes me appreciate thrash giants even more. It's hard to find a good band. I have yet to discover a good one that is newer or younger guitarists. Lately, I've only been listening to rammstein and that's not even thrash, but they've figured out how to make good metal rock songs of the quality I have grown to expect.

p583
aVTestament's Formation of Damnation and Dark Roots of Earth albums are both awesome, and feel modern to me. More importantly, they feel *alive*, they actually have genuine energy. I got into Testament late, with TFOD, and have gone back to the older stuff since, The Gathering and The Ritual are great too. The thing with Testament is that they are still reaching, still trying. DROE in particular has many little layers and fills, etc. with makes things melodic and interesting. Seriously, listen to their last two albums with headphones, then switch the headphones around, it sounds quite different because there are so many harmonies and extra fills spread around. Awesome!\u000a\u000aIt's pretty safe to say that Dave Mustaine has written more awesome music as an individual than anyone in the big four, he's pretty much been the driving force in Megadeth since day one. That is a huge feat. That said, Megadeth's energy has been going down ever since United Abominations.  There are still some great riffs on Thirteen, but it just feels formulaic. Play this part four times, then this part, repeat. Funny though, I've only had two CD's in the car for the past year; a Megadeth mix CD and Sepultura's Arise. Ahh the good stuff.\u000a\u000aDeath Magnetic was a good return to form for Metallica, but was a production nightmare in my opinion. I listened to it like crazy when it came out, but these days I never do. Oddly enough it's like it hasn't aged well. The stripped down, ultra compressed sound just gets grating after a while, and the songs are just too fucking long, they tried to hard with that aspect. I hope it's like Megadeth's The World needs a hero; not quite back on course, but turning in the right direction. I actually liked the Load era stuff, it's just not what you expect from them, not metal per-se (which is totally fine). I couldn't even watch the behind the scenes stuff for DM. It felt like the band was just floating through the process, with a bunch of smug kids at the production controls. Kind of embarrasing. Metallica and Megadeth would both be better off musically if they just played what they felt like, regardless of genre, and shed a bunch of the business/production shit that they have gotten way too comfortable with.\u000a\u000aNever really got deep into Anthrax or Slayer, but I like a bunch of their stuff too.\u000a\u000aThese critisisms are just musings of a fan, who am I to judge anyway? I would still kill to see any of these bands live. They are the keystone bands that define the genre for a reason. They are fucking awesome.
p584
aVSame story for Black Metal. I've been racking my fucking brain for years trying to come up with the next evolution... That is, an admirable evolution, not a cross-mixing of ten different genres. What will be next level, the thrash, the death, the black... These amazing foundations were set by pioneers... So what the fuck is wrong with my generation?! AARGH!!!
p585
aVI think maybe the problem is, back in the day, people had less distractions. In the 80s, you learned guitar, and played for hours and hours, you jammed with people who did the same. Now--too many distractions. \u000a\u000aI don't know for sure if that is why new GOOD metal artists are hard to find.
p586
aVWhat about Vektor?
p587
aVNow, I am a huge fan of this band, so this is a bit biased, but [Tantara](http://soundcloud.com/indierecordings/tantara-based-on-evil) really gives me the old thrash vibe, without sounding like a rehash of the 80's. Interesting riffs, good lyrics with relevant themes and they're guys that really tend to their fans in a good way.\u000a\u000aI also like the two newest albums by Overkill. I really enjoy the more fast-paced thrash with aggressive drums and riffing, and that is exactly what those albums offer. Granted, I haven't heard much of the old Overkill, so I don't know if it their newest efforts are really similiar to their old stuff, but it was really something new and exciting for me the first time I heard them.

aVCheck out Possessor.  www.facebook.com/possessormetal

aVRide The Lightning, again and again.\u000aAn overall more intense record that flows more cohesively, in my opinion.
p621
aVHmm.. tough call. While the highs of Ride the Lightning (For Whom the Bell Tolls &amp; Fade to Black) are greater than Master of Puppets for me, I've never seen a song so out of place like Escape was on that album.  For musical content, it's dead even for me. \u000a\u000aSo I'd say Ride the Lightning based upon the production. I like a bit more of a raw production on thrash albums, it's part of the allure of thrash for me. 
p622
aVEscape... yeah that's a good point.  It's easy to forget sometimes that Lightning has a throw away song, whereas Puppets is solid all the way through.

p758
aVRisk exists remember.
p759
aVDefinitely better than the previous single I heard from this album.  I wish Dave had stuck with what he was doing on Endgame though, for latter-day Megadeth that's about as good as it's gonna get.  What little I've heard of this one suggests he's going back to a poppier, less thrashy songwriting style.
p760
aVStill a good song though. He doesn't have the energy or creativity left to do pure complicated thrash like in his youth, the guy is 55. I'd cut him a break.  We probably won't ever get another RIP or SFSGSW, KIMB, or PS, or even CTE, or even Youthanasia. It just won't ever happen. These were timeless legendary masterpieces made in the pinnacle of this guy's career.\u000a\u000aBut at least he's trying. And it's just disrespectful to have a new megadeth song that can't even get 1 upvote. \u000a\u000aI can see that happening with supercollider, but this is not that bad.

asVMegadeth - In my Darkest Hour (Big 4 Concert)
p763
(lp764
VWow, if you fucking watched this concert, Megadeth fucking killed. Out of all the bands, Megadeth delivered. In my opinion (which will get "downvoted into oblivion" and my personal opinion) it goes like this: Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer and Metallica. Being on a "thrash" subreddit, I know Metallica is loved and they did a fantastic job, but they were the worst of the four.
p765
aVI think all of the bands were pretty strong at this show, especially Anthrax. I was at the Big 4 at Yankee Stadium and there I think it went Anthrax, Slayer, Megadeth (Dave had to get surgery the next day and you could tell he was in pain, but good on him for trying) and although Metallica had a lot of energy, James's vocals weren't impressive.

aVI agree. I only saw the DVD (I would have shit my pants if I were able to see this live), but all bands performed extremely well. Anthrax really impressed me.

aVTo me it sounds like a song that never made it in Ride The Lightning, so they tweaked it. Can't wait for more songs though!
p891
aVToo little too late.  Sounds like they are listening to some of the new wave of thrash and taking cues from those bands.
p892
aVIt sounds like they're listening to themselves. Parts of this song remind me of Dyer's Eve, ...And Justice For All, Leper Messiah, and the intro reminds me of Kill 'Em All. I even got a Slayer vibe at some point, and I love Slayer. But even if you wanna go off of the "new thrash" idea, new thrash is great.

p897
aVThey might be, but good music is good music.

aVIt's by far the weakest part of this song, but somehow I think I'll get over it.
p900
aVLars is the weakest part of this song...and the last decade...
p901
aVDude Lars is killing it here...
p902
aVNo, he's really not. I've been a lifelong fan of Metallica, listening since the 80's. I am a drummer. I've played metal, thrash, etc...off and on for 20 years and Lars is one of my influences as a drummer. His work on albums through "...And Justice for All" is some of the best and he should be considered a pioneer, but he isn't a relevant drummer anymore. I saw them live a couple years ago when Lamb of God opened up for them and the show really should have ended there. Metallica played Dyer's Eve and Lars didn't even play the double-bass through the entire song...it was heartbreaking, and I'll never see them live again. 
p903
aVHe's obviously practiced since then; he's playing the double bass. I was disappointed in Dyer's Eve live as well, but he obviously worked towards this.
p904
aV&gt; Metallica played Dyer's Eve and Lars didn't even play the double-bass through the entire song\u000a\u000aWow, [this really is sad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Us1X63fMpw)
p905
aVIt sounds bad because this is a shitty cell phone recording, but James's voice is actually pretty much back. Go listen to Fight Fire With Fire at the Orion festival in 2012, and then go listen to All Nightmare Long off Death Magnetic. You'll find that he still has the versatility to do thrash vocals.

aVCheck out that surprise show at Orion where they played Kill 'Em All songs, his voice is good. Not old level awesome, but pretty good.

aVI'm not usually into death metal either. But I find that that Melodic Death Metal strikes a certain cord with me more so than other death genres.\u000a\u000aAmon Amarth is my current favorite (The Pursuit Of Vikings being my favorite song(and what got me into it in the first place)): http://youtu.be/v20mhyekByU\u000a\u000aScar Symmetry is another good one to check out: http://youtu.be/23RJHxIzrw4\u000a
p915
aVgive it a try, dude. worst thing that happens is you don't like it. Cannibal Corpse is my personal favorite but i also like Deicide, a little bit of Nile, and when i'm in the mood for it some Six Feet Under. (not a huge death metal fan but i do like some bands) i'd imagine people would tell you to give Behemoth and Death a listen as well. 
p916
aVok I will :) its seem that Death is very popular so I might try them out.
p917
aVFirst couple of albums by Death sound a lot like thrash but with growling so that might be a nice starting point. Generally old death meal has a tendency to sound like thrash.
p918
aVOne of the most notable bands that got me into death metal was Kataklysm... I mostly listened to thrash and melodic death before.\u000a\u000aTry [Serenity In Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMmbdnbOz9k) and [Shadows And Dust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXHLwVWsFgA)!
p919

aVFor whatever reason, writing good solos is incredibly difficult, even for the most famous lead guitarists in the world--but Marty Friedman is simply phenomenal at this.\u000a\u000aHe knows how to play with emotion.

aVRon Jarzombek. Fuck yea.\u000a\u000aI would say a tie between Erik Nelson from Vektor or Rob Pellegri from Lich King. Erik is incredible with his harmonizing and musical flow. Rob is just a fucking badass with his solos (check out [Fan Massacre](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4ZUkwj2qHE) for a taste of what I mean).
p1065
aVTough to call a favorite, but I always thought Glenn Tipton and KK Downing had some of coolest solos.  
p1066
aVNot thrash. But i guess painkiller is kinda thrashy and that is a killer fucking solo (well, both of them).

aVThey always do. They play just as hard for a small group as they do for bigger shows. Can't wait til they play in front of thousands. I know they played Whiskey a Go Go in Cali before they came to AZ for the Dark Tranquility tour and they said it was fucking packed as shit haha. 
p1080
aVSaw them with Dark Tranquility and Exmortus took the show.  Seriously, they had their shit together so very well.  Their whole album is good too
p1081
aVThe whole discography is good haha. I have gone to just about every show they have done here in AZ since 07. I honestly didn't even watch the other two bands when they were on the DT tour. I just hung with them hahahaha. DT is fine and all but not completely up my alley. \u000aExmortus has got to be the tightest band I've ever had the pleasure of hearing haha. Their whole discography is good
p1082
aVThese guys slay. I've been listening to them since about 07 when I first saw them live. They've become my favourite of the new bands. Fantastic guitar work and heavy as fuck. Super nice guys as well. They're about to start a tour with Destruction soon. Please go check them out. They have some of the best live shows I've ever seen and I've never seen someone unhappy with their shows, even new fans haha. Please check em out and talk to them, they're cool as fuck and humble as all hell.

They autographed their new CD and a poster for me, and it was my birthday, when I told them that they wished me happy birthday both in person and in the autographs too.\u000a\u000aProbably the best birthday of my life, and my awesome wife set it up, since DT is my favorite band.

VSounds a little better than World Painted Blood, but it's still pretty boring, IMO.
p1092
aVDespite everyone not liking the song, due to it not being 'slayer', I really like it.  It reminds me of Tantara's singer a bit when he screams "Implode!".  But the solo...isn't even a solo though, man :(
p1093
aVWhat's tantara up to?
p1094
aVTheir latest facebook post: \u000a\u000a"What's up guys, long time no see, but we've been busy taking some time off lately. All is good in the world of Tantara and we hope to finish writing our album soon..."\u000a\u000aSo, not much, apparently. Really looking forward to the new album next year, though!
p1095
aVAh, thanks. I followed them when their drummer was doing Metallica covers on YouTube before Tantara. Then I kinda lost interest after their first album and their EP/Demo. Not too bad! Can't wait for their new one then. 
p1096
aVHoping the rest of the album is better than this... it's not terrible, but it sounds to me like a rejected Christ Illusion track.

(lp1132
VThere Toxic Holocaust. They are a 3 piece band. If I'm right it bass, a guitar which is also played by the lead singer, and the drums.
p1133
aVMunicipal Waste is all one guitar, Overkill used to be all one guitar for their first four albums or so, Sodom is a power trio to this day, as is S.O.D., D.R.I., and a lot of others.
p1134
aVAlso ANVIL. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anvil_(band)\u000a
p1135
aVCoroner, Destruction, Venom, as well as what everyone else has said. That's just off the top of my head. I know there's a lot more.
p1136
aVCoroner is fucking amazing
p1137
aVDestruction is the shit.
p1138
aVThey may not be pure thrash, but they're *thrashy*, but Pantera did alright for themselves with one guitarist.\u000a\u000aProng was thrash for awhile as a 3 piece and they were damn good.  They changed sounds here and there and occasionally added a second guitar live but for the most part were/are 3 piece.  \u000a\u000aPropain is often a 3 piece, but sometimes they add a rythym guitarist.  Again not really *thrash* but similar enough to demonstrate a trio can pull it off.\u000a\u000aAlso Voivod did a stint in the 90s as a trio.
p1139
aVYeah I guess Pantera did okay for themselves.. ha.  I'd forgotten about Prong, I guess because I think of them as more part of that whole 90's Brooklyn thing.\u000a
p1140
aVAbsu, while not strictly thrash, and more like black thrash, has performed as a trio in the past. Maybe even recorded some shit as a trio, but I can't confirm this. 
p1141
aV[Wargasm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab-USkm107E) is an awesome power trio, [Forced Entry](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=we%27re+dicks+forced+entry&amp;oq=we%27re+dicks+forced+entry&amp;gs_l=youtube.3...491.1763.0.2536.7.6.0.0.0.0.173.637.3j3.6.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.qPeRxmS-4ME) is pretty cool as well.  I believe Annihilator only had one guitar for awhile, and Razor only had one for most their career, Tankard hasn't had two for awhile.  Destruction comes to mind as well as Exciter if you count them as thrash.  There is also S.O.D., Whiplash, Sodom, Sadus, Realm, Exumer.  Quite a few if you look into it.

p1194
aVChecking it out on Spotify this minute. 'Rise Up' is pretty bitchin' so far.
p1195
aVi'd have to say Last Stand for Independence and A Day In The Death are my 2 favorites. Cold Embrace isn't bad either.
p1196
aVThe dark toots of thrash tour was fucking sick as well

aVi didn't make it to that tour (no shows near where i live, sad panda) but i got to see Testament when they were touring with Anthrax.

aVI'm pretty sure if I was using such a rig, people would have no choice but to notice ;)
p1209
aVTo be fair its the rig my band uses. I use the Mesa other guitarist uses the Marshall.
p1210
aVCool, what Boogie you rocking? I was thinking of getting one for my next amp but have decided to go with an Engl instead. They just sound so blistering.
p1211
aVMy last name is also Marshall so I get the 'like the amp company' thing all the time. \u000aI roll with the Triple rec. You can't go wrong with Engl man. Those amps are great, such clear gain.
p1212
aVHaha, although that must get annoying after a while. That's exactly how I'd describe the Engl sound. I used a Mark V to record my band's demo, it was totally seething.
p1213
aVThat's one thing that's always pulled me towards Engl, but the old school chug my Mesa puts out is destructive. What pickups are you using?
p1214
aVEMG 81s. I held out against getting them for so long but a guitar that I've wanted for a very long time (LTD EC1000) has them in, so when I got it I was kind of converted. I'd prefer to prefer my Bareknuckle Nailbomb though. You?
p1215
aVYour right, I thought the post said  last 12 years..whoops
p1216
aVAgreed with Dark Roots of Earth. Probably one of my favorite albums of 2012. Phantom Antichrist was great too. \u000aThe new Warbeast album, Destroy, that came out earlier this week kicks all kinds of ass. There's nothing soft about it.

Glad Souza is back as long as he doesn't write the fucking lyrics.\u000aStill wish Baloff was around, mind you.
p1413
aVSouza is my favourite of Exodus's vocalists myself.He's really hit and miss with lyrics, I agree. Cheesy as fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. I saw them with Dukes as well and just thought he came off as a dick wad. As far as I've seen, he's a nice as fuck dude, but on stage, he just seems like an obnoxious idiot. I'm glad Souza is back in the fold. Great vocalist, and he doesn't seem like a moron on stage. Baloff is great, and I'll get shit for this I'm sure, but vocally, he isn't my favourite. He had the attitude sure, but man, listening to BBB can be hard sometimes because they have his vocals buried in so much reverb to make him sound good. He came off so much better live. Like the live in Dynamo right before Pleasures was released and before Souza, he sounds fucking bad ass there. If he had pulled that off on the album, that would have been so good. The reverb being gone makes him so much better.

aVI do too. But the direction they're going fits who they are now. New Metallica is still great, but the wild, uncaring, fuck you attitude will always be the Metallica that made me fall in love with metal.
p1742
aVI have to disagree. Metallica is the new KISS. They have some sort of merch for everything now. It's not a band, it's a brand. They are mailing it in, and have been for at least a decade. I love this band, but I won't even go see them live anymore. James still has that wicked downstroke riff, but his voice is flat out gone. The grit is non-existent. I mean I know why, huge tour after black album, blah blah. Kirk is pentatonic with a wah pedal, and still has most his parts written for him. Lars... well, we won't go there. Everyone knows. And Rob has zero business being in this band. Go back to ST and Infectious Grooves. And his basketball jersey "costume" and cheesy flame job basses really bother me, no idea why. Just seems so 1999 to me. Decent player, wrong band.\u000a\u000aAnd the downtuning. Oh the downtuning. Biggest disappointment yet. Honestly, if you're at they age where you have to change the key of songs, and water down drum parts, it's time to hang it up. Especially in a metal band. A former "thrash" metal band at that.\u000a\u000aI'm hardcore. I still have my battle jacket from 1986 with the original Damage Inc. backpatch. I just wish they would call it a day before I become even more embarrassed to own it. To me a Metallica fan in the eighties meant no one fucked with you. We were an army. Now it's not just becoming soft, it's becoming a joke and it seriously breaks my heart.\u000a\u000aAll Nightmare Long is pretty decent and the Full Arsenal Tour was cool though.

VTestament has always been one of my favorites. I think they put the right riffs with decent song writings, on top of excellent solo work by Skolnick. The first four albums may have a decent amount of filler, but they aren't BAD songs. On top of the usual greats (Over the Wall, Into the Pit, Souls of Black) they sometimes throw a curve ball and give something really different but just as kickass, like Musical Death(A Dirge) \u000a\u000aI also saw them last week on the Dark Roots of Thrash tour, if you have the chance you should check them out. It was really a great show and flawlessly executed by all the guys, and who doesn't love Gene Hoglan.

p2017
aVThe first Lazarus AD album is killer. After that... Eh, not so much. 
p2018
aVDamn, I never heard Noisem before. They are badass. Plunging into Darkeness by Fueled by fire is a good one too. Their first album seemed like such a novelty but Plunging was super badass. Destruction's album The Antichrist is pretty modern-ish sounding, I'm really into it.

aVSome of my thrash favorites are Stone from Finland, Forced Entry and Panic from Seattle, Rage from Germany, although Rage are a bit more speed than thrash. A lot of the best bands are less well-known.
p2059
aV[DEATH ANGEL!](http://youtu.be/BH8nfDIOkFk)\u000a\u000a
p2060
aVI'm really loving Sacred Mother Tongue lately.  They started off metalcore but have moved into exclusively heavy and thrash metal:\u000a\u000a[A Light Will Shine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGY1bUEW1mc)\u000a\u000a[Evolve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XetrdAdOM)\u000a\u000aThey have some sick riffs that reminds you of that perfect 80s-90s thrash like the big four. Their vocalist sings really well and actually puts work into song structure unlike most metal bands.\u000a\u000aThe guitarist is incredibly talented and even has videos of basically simulating the style of many famous guitarists.\u000a\u000aIf you're looking for more stuff that has that aggression, high-tempo, but melodic kind of metal (though albeit may not be as heavy), I introduce a lot of good new bands and old classics in /r/catchymelodicmetal as well. But only if you want to expand a bit more than just thrash metal.
p2061
aVThank you for this - I too have been looking to expand my thrash...

aVMight I recommend a couple of bands on my label?  I know, blatant self-promotion, but I think both bands are great and I was recommending the first one for years before I literally started my own label specifically to help them out.  \u000a\u000aBesieged.  These guys are from Winnipeg and play very fast, VERY heavy death-tinged thrash, sort of in the style of Sepultura (old) and Demolition Hammer.  We just reissued their 2010 album "Victims Beyond All Help" (tragically overlooked) and they're working on a new one now as well.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyezfvY8xcg\u000a\u000aBirth A.D.  If you like crossover (punk mixed with thrash) - e.g. SOD, DRI, Suicidal Tendencies, Municipal Waste - you should really enjoy this.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETjTks4xSkw
p2073
aVI'm not super into trash, I enjoy it from time to time, but usually I like something more mellow. That being said, one of my favorite thrash bands are [Carnivore](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz4Nw1kPu4Q) - only 2 albums so not that much to dig through. Their goal was to be as offensive as possible, and their songs actually vary in style and form.
p2074
aVI personally love Evile, but they do tend to be really fast riffs all the time.\u000a\u000a[Listen to this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=924bRfmiJ20) and tell me they're not pulling off old school thrash perfectly.

VGoing to preface this by saying that I'm in 100% support of you guys continuing this. I'm a huge fan of thrash and death metal and love to hear up-and-coming projects such as yours, so understand that my critiques are coming from a place of wanting you to improve, not from wanting you to stop or feel discouraged. And remember that I am only one opinion among billions.\u000a\u000aThe vocals: The very first line ("July, 1943 Operation Citadel") seems to run too long. The phrase pushes into the first and second beats of the following measures. If your music was straight droning death/doom, that wouldn't be such a huge deal, but thrash is an entirely different story. When I listen to thrash, I expect my heartbeat to rise and to be continuously banging my head, even if it's just a slight nodding while sitting in traffic. What accentuates thrash into my head/body wanting to move that way is the congruence of the vocals, drums and guitar/bass hitting the final beat in a measure together. It's almost a palatable resolution to each riff or each measure when that happens. With the vocals in this current rendition, they are actually preventing that feeling because of how much of his phrasing bleeds over into other measures. There's not enough solid closure and transition into the next riffs, so it feels at times as if the riffs really aren't changing and that the vocals are the main attraction (which, in thrash, it usually is not). Perhaps a suggestion would be to not allow the phrases to be drawn out longer than the first beat of the next measure. Hopefully this makes sense. The vocalist will be fine, in my opinion, as long as that can be worked on. The tone of his growls are decent, but if you look in the sidebar for this subreddit, even there you can see "tempo, abrupt riff changes". Not sure if they are referencing the same thing I am here, but as I said, drawn out phrasing, extended growls, are hard to place properly in this style of music. It can be done, but for the most part, vocals should be pretty quick, tight phrasing.\u000a\u000aThe end of the Chorus section is anticlimactic. "Grind of treads relentless" seems to end at an obscure point that doesn't accentuate the end of the riff it is being used in. Also, it seems some of the lines are pushed together without much riff-room to breathe, specifically between "Onward through the smoke and dust" and "The mechanized ranks are thrust, Roar of guns endless". Seems as if these phrases were shoved in to that section just to add words, not to actually accentuate the music.\u000a\u000aThis section did this relatively well, and perhaps should be looked at as an example: "Emotionless weapons, the world at war\u000aThe burning carcasses of iron beasts\u000aShock action, Steel melee"\u000a\u000aAnyway, when I get the chance, I will add some more. I'm at work at the moment. Hope this helps.

VI really dig "Give Me Liberty..." I'm getting the album tonight. 
p2255
aVIt's a big change from Time is UP. It's also a slightly different line up (new bassist) though. I enjoyed "I am the State", "Give Me Liberty", and "Unnatural Selection", but the other tracks were confusing, seeing as how their first two albums rip your brains apart. I noticed on their facebook they seem to refer to themselves as heavy metal now, so maybe they're making a genre hop. Either way I'll still rock their first two releases, plus Point of No Return, and always support their thrashy stuff.
p2256
aVSo, I shouldn't buy the album, then? I like thrash PERIOD. If it's not thrash, I'm gonna be real bummed.
p2257
aVStraight up, I was disappointed when I listened to the album. It's not that the songs are terrible, most just seem to fall short of me wanting to listen to them again. The album itself lacks that in your face screaming adrenaline thrash usually has. The songs I mentioned before are the ones I will be adding to my "thrash" playlist. The album is $8 on itunes if you want go give it a try. I pre-ordered the album, but if I hadn't I would only purchase those three songs.

aVThe fact that this sub *has* the traditional Big 4 --whose new releases mostly suck--in the sidebar, and not as a blacklist like /r/BlackMetal does with prominent artists in that genre is a good reason for me to prefer /r/truethrash.

Do yourself a favor and get the fuck away from screaming shit. \u000a\u000a\u000aMy suggestions to you guys is to find another guitarist to round out your sound. Give a listen to bands like Exodus, Hexen, Saxxon, and Machine Head. Try some Sepultura. I guarantee you you have nothing to lose by trying things out with two guitarists instead of three.

aVNo this and kill 'em all are both more speed metal than thrash metal
p2440
aVNo. Kill 'Em All is one of the most pivotal thrash metal albums of all time. You seem to be completely ignorant about what thrash metal is.\u000a\u000aThe critics at the time had called it "the true birth of thrash".\u000a\u000aOne also said "it also captures thrash on the cusp of blowing up" and "it became, for better or worse, the benchmark against which early thrash [album] would be measured"\u000a\u000aThis album, Kill 'Em All, is what true thrash metal is all about, fast riffs, aggression, anger, driving tempo, tempo changes, distortion, punk-rock song structures melding it with heavy metal. It is the definition of thrash metal.

p2443
aVToday's standards are the same as in 1980s. The only difference is there's more thrash metal bands that try to alter what thrash metal is and try to get themselves that label despite not relating much to it.

p2627
aVHave you seen Slayer or Exodus recently? The real issue with Metallica now is Lars. Other drummers, like Dave Lombardo (before last year's unfortunate exit from Slayer), Tom Hunting are still excellent drummers who can play all the songs just as good as they did 20 years ago. Lars cannot.\u000a\u000aI am still a fan too, but you'll never see this quality of playing from them again, because Lars can't hack it. It is really sad.

p2791
aVboth CM and NB (i prefer the latter) seem to be good at that, especially making good deals and not doing all the work for the bands. And most of the bands they sign that dont know shit end up getting dropped (or leaving) after one release. Im fairly sure that havok is gonna be on CM for quite some time. Looking forward to see how big they get
p2792
aVWell, they're probably gonna do fine since David is one hell of a business man. HOWEVER, all I care about is that they put out a better album than Unnatural Selection, that was a huge bummer for me. 
p2793
aVTheyve been so hard at work constantly for the past...what..5 years? Touring nonstop. Although its not THAAT bad, im letting their latest record just speak as an example that havok is able to work nonstop and still manage to put together an album that is at least great
p2794
aVBasically, its not the worst album in the world, but it was a let down. They do a good job of working constantly, but there was a lot of cheese on that album unfortunately. But, they've had some short comings here and there, like the Murder by Metal demo from back in 06 I believe, there is a song on there that is a huge pile of shit. I think its called Die Young. Despite not caring for their new album entirely, i'm still excited for more, I hope they redeem themselves, as they've been one of my favourites since I first saw them back in 07.

p2842
aVI guess it was the instrumental part of it that got me going. It had awesome riffs, the chorus was/is catchy and it really reminded me of Dyer's Eve, but separated itself from it in some way. The fact that they are Norwegian also contributed to my interest, as the selection of good Norwegian metal is low (not really that much into Black Metal).

aVConsidering I listen almost exclusively to thrash metal, I find no better band than Megadeth. Feel free to share any bands you consider better at thrash than Megadeth. (Not from the Big 4, I've listened to them, I prefer Megadeth and Slayer).
p2901
aVPersonally, I think Testament were putting out the best thrash in the 80s, and they are still putting out some of the best thrash today. Exodus and Death Angel are very close behind and again, both are still putting out quality music. Even some of the newer bands like Vektor are bringing the genre to new levels. Megadeth have my respect for their past accomplishments, but I find their music boring and their recent stuff appalling. But hey, opinions. 
p2902
aVI might give those bands a try, now that you mention it. Don't know why you're being downvoted though.

p2977
aVLol i INSTANTLY thought of THAT Slaughter upon first reading it.\u000aAnd while I don't hate them, it made me cringe to think of them on someone's thrash list. But then of course it wasn't them. So all was good.\u000a\u000aI never really did care for that track though, I mean the glam rock Slaughter one you posted. But some of their other stuff wasn't too bad. Mike Slaughter had a decent voice when he wasn't trying to make your dog howl. If he'd have kept from the high pitched shit they would have been at least decent.
p2978
aVTragic Period by Exhorder from that album is one of the best songs ever made.. The burning of Sodom from Darkness Descends is really beast too, one of the fastest songs ever.

p2985
aVSodom are not thrash metal
p2986
aVHow could you think Sodom is not thrash metal? \u000a\u000a* Fast aggressive tempos, low-register, complex guitar riffs, high-register guitar solos and double bass drumming.\u000a\u000a* Tempo, abrupt riff changes.\u000a\u000a* High mid-tones on distortion.\u000a\u000a* Vocally, anything from melodic singing to shouted vocals.\u000a\u000a* Most thrash guitar solos are played at high speed\u000a\u000a* Often influenced by the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement and punk elements.\u000a\u000a* Thrash tends to have an accelerating feel\u000a\u000a* Drumming: two bass drums, double-bass pedal for tempo\u000a\u000aSodom has ALL of those dude. Sodom is clearly a Thrash Metal^TM band. I can't even think of a counter argument. 
p2987
aVCompletely wrong, next you'll be telling me Devin Townsend is Papa Eremitus.

p3037
aVImho that can be said for 80% of all metal bands :)

aVi totally agree... however, the occasional cheesiness doesn't even scratch the epicness of some of those killer riffs, in my opinion. you don't often find the epicness of such riffs played in such a clean way. listen to the re-recording of bloodbath for example, it's incredible!

p3119
aVI agree with you, but I try not to expect the masterpieces of the 90s from a bunch of 50+ year olds. I'm looking for "decent." Decent is what I can't find even in many young musicians these days.
p3120
aVDance in the rain is definitely one of my favorites off this album. The album definitely isn't pure thrash (the titly track sucks), but some of the songs are fast as he'll and heavy as shit.
p3121
aVDave's vocals have regressed so much, I can't stand them.
p3122
aVSeems like it.
p3123
aVTo me it sounds like he's more truthful to himself about what he can do and what he can't. I think the old albums sound like he's pressuring himself into singing in a way he can't.
p3124
aVI mean he could never sing, but now it sounds like uninspired spoken word with stupid lyrics.
p3125
aVAfter my first listen through I only really liked "Cold sweat" and "Kingmaker". It doesn't seem like a very good album to me but I'll give it another listen before I make a decision.
p3126
aVDamn, I can't decide much about it either. I've only heard the samples so far. They seem fairly decent, like I think this album is probably better than abysmal "th1rteen", but I doubt it's as good as Endgame.
p3127
aVCold sweat was an interesting cover choice!
p3128
aVThis is garbage. I loved every album up until this one (besides Risk). Dave has lost his touch and is playing it safe.
p3129
aVI understand that a band doesn't want to always rehash what they did before, but why does that mean that they have to cut their nuts off and write radio friendly bullshit songs.  Historically, Megadeth is my favorite band, which is probably why I find this album so appalling.  The irony is that as the bands "mature" and "progress" their music becomes more and more cookie cutter and it is embarrassing.  I don't even want to see them on tour this time because I can't sit there and listen to him sing this garbage.
p3130
aVI highly doubt they will get on radio so I don't think that's the issue here. \u000a\u000aThough I think they do try to appeal to a wider audience and simply can't write as creatively and with complexity and aggressive speeds anymore.
p3131
aVI actually like it a lot, I'm not surprised the thrash community hasn't taken a liking to it, but thrash fans in general just don't like it when artists try to branch out. I think the title track is really well-done, and there are a bunch of other standouts on the album like Dance In The Rain and Forget To Remember.\u000a\u000aI think it's refreshing when a band like Megadeth tries to get out of a rut by trying something new, rather than making the same album over and over again.

aV3 Inches of Blood is a pretty good band. One of their best albums, in my opinion, is Fire up the Blades. It has some really good thrash and great drumming. They also have an interesting way they do their vocals. They have two singers. One to do the clean higher-end vocals, en-kin to Rob Halford and the other one to do the low-end growler style vocals. This makes for some really great sounds when the harmonize. Their songs do tend to be on the short side but that's just nit picking.\u000a\u000a\u000aTL:DR 3 Inches of Blood great band, go listen to them.

aVYou went full retard man...
p3171
aVDid I? I apologise, I don't know the exact specifications for Thrash Metal.
p3172
aVYou don't know what thrash metal is at all
p3173
aVOkay, explain to me what Thrash metal is. I don't know EXACTLY what they are, I just know the generals.
p3174
aVTechnically speaking... Thrash metal is Heavy metal and punk mixed together. Literally? It's fast paced, aggressive, more raw and dissonant sounding, low shredding riffs with soaring solo's, and with either high pitched wirey vocals (i.e, early exodus) or harsher growly-ish vocals (i.e. warbringer). The description for thrash is in the sidebar i just reworded it.\u000a\u000aFirst off, Rammstein isn't metal at all, Pantera can be catagorized as thrash but most metal heads (or maybe just me) like to put them in their own genre (Groove metal), and AILD is Melodic Metal-core. I haven't heard anything past their 3rd CD, but when Shadows are Security came out it got pretty lame. Looking back with the taste's in music i have now, it was all pretty lame.
p3175
aVRammstein is metal...
p3176
aVNo, they are not, they are metal by non-metal head standards. Just like drowning pool. You can't do songs with bands like T.a.T.u. and call yourself metal.
p3177
aVThey are a metal band. They produce mostly metal music. They have produced some non metal music but that makes them no less of a metal band. Get off your high horse and deal with it. I don't even like rammstein. I think they're a horribly over rated band. But still metal. 
p3178
aVI'm may be on a high horse, but they are not a metal band. They could have been at some point in their career but they are not now. As you said, just flip-flopped.. Just because you produce some metal music doesn't make you metal. \u000a\u000aJust googled and listened to 8 rammstein songs and came to the same conclusion that they are not metal. Industrial/Hard Rock with metal influences? Sure, but...\u000a\u000aIf making playing triplets/shredding with a distorted guitar tone (over usually one riff per song), some heavy drums, and dark sounding vocals is all you need to be metal in your eyes then so be it.\u000a\u000aEveryone wants to be metal, it takes something special to actually be.
p3179
aVWhatever dude I can't be bothered to argue. You can believe that shit if you want to. But just know. You're a fucking idiot. 
p3180
aVMaybe you shouldn't start things you don't care to finish? It's OK though, I know how the internet works. You can't be "bothered" and call me an idiot to cop out of the argument that you started because it's so easy to do so over this series of tubes. Take this time to reflect, listen to, and spread the word of some real metal instead of trying to defend bands that think they can desecrate and consume a genre, that is so brilliant, into the mainstream like Rammstein.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQVV2HG2RJ0\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfgqWkgImq8\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZpyJkAPL68

p3454
aVIf you're a fan of early Destruction, Sodom etc., you know, beastial black metal/blackened thrash metal, Endless Pain is pretty good. The best track off of it in my opinion is Flag Of Hate. They play it live pretty often even now.\u000a\u000aPleasure To Kill is a classic and considered to be one of their best/the best album, the whole album is pretty sick, but my favorites are Pleasure To Kill, The Pestilence, Command Of The Blade and Under The Guillotine.\u000a\u000aTerrible Certainty is a bit better controlled than the previous albums, it has better sound quality, production and so on. It's not just brutality and speed here anymore like in Pleasure To Kill. My favs here are Blind Faith and Storming With Menace.\u000a\u000aExtreme Aggression is where the things get awesome. I think this is their best album, the riffs here are really memorable and nice, the songwriting is good. I can't even select the best tracks off of this album, I like them all.\u000a\u000aComa Of Souls has some really good songs in terms of lyrics (When The Sun Burns Red, \u000aPeople Of The Lie), the instrumentals are okay. \u000a\u000aI'm not a fan of the newer albums except Violent Revolution and Phantom Antichrist.

aVAlthough I'm not a huge fan of the entire album, Riot of Violence is a great song off of Pleasure to Kill. Endless Pain is also a pretty good album. I kind of like the lo-fi production it has, and it feels a bit tighter to me that Pleasure to Kill does.

p3475

aVThunderbirds are heavy but they have the thrash growl and really nice necks.
p3480
aVThe Yamaha RBXJM2 works quite well for me, but is controversial. Some people love it, some hate it. The string spacing is relatively narrow, and slapping is relatively hard. it has a growly sound, and the built-in EQ means that you might need a pre-amp when you want to use effects. It doesn't have very well defined heights. On the plus side, it is ridiculously easy to play, string spacing is relatively narrow, there are six strings, and it has a growly sound. I played Prog and normal metal with it. I wouldn't want to play a four-stringer again. I didn't utilise the high C much, but having the low B is brilliant in metal I think.

VDETAILS FOR JEFF HANNEMAN MEMORIAL CELEBRATION:\u000a\u000aThe Jeff Hanneman Memorial Celebration will take place on Thursday, May 23 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles from 3:30 \u2013 7:30PM. Hanneman passed away on May 2 at the age of 49.\u000a\u000aThe Memorial Celebration will be free and open to the public on a first-come, first-in basis (subject to venue capacity). All ages are welcome, and paid parking will be available around the venue.\u000a\u000aJeff Hanneman helped shape Slayer\u2019s uncompromising thrash-metal sound as well as an entire genre of music. His riffs of fury and punk-rock attitude were heard in the songs he wrote, including Slayer classics \u201cAngel of Death,\u201d \u201cRaining Blood,\u201d \u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d and \u201cWar Ensemble.\u201d Hanneman co-founded Slayer with fellow-guitarist Kerry King, bassist Tom Araya and drummer Dave Lombardo in Huntington Park, CA in 1981. For more than 30 years, Hanneman was the band member who stayed out of the spotlight, rarely did interviews, amassed an impressive collection of World War II memorabilia, was with his wife Kathy for nearly three decades, shut off his phone and went incommunicado when he was home from tour, did not want to be on the road too late into any December as Christmas was his favorite holiday, and, from the time he was about 12 years old, woke up every, single day with one thing on his mind: playing the guitar.\u000a\u000aIt was once suggested to Slayer that if they would write \u201cjust one mainstream song that could get on the radio,\u201d they would likely sell millions of records and change the commercial course of their career, similar to what had happened to Metallica with 1993\u2032s \u201cEnter Sandman.\u201d Jeff was the first to draw a line of integrity in the sand, replying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to make a Slayer record. If you can get it on the radio, fine, if not, then fuck it.\u201d

p3580
aVA few years ago, when I was a freshmen in high school, I'd easily vote for Metallica, but, idk I guess I burnt myself out with Metallica and they got kinda old to me. But ever since I got into Slayer, I can't stop listening, they don't get old (especially Reign In Blood).
p3581
aVFirst place for Slayer, second for old Metallica and then Megadeth. Never really understood why Anthrax is on the big four, (even tho i like the band very much) but there are easily better ones out there. Like example Annihilator or Testament.
p3582
aVPeople are not aware of the depth, intricacy, and masterpieces made by Anthrax. They just don't have as much clout and albums as the other 3 bands. They also have very strange music sometimes that makes you not want to listen to others. \u000a\u000ai.e., it's hard to get into, but Anthrax is definitely deserving of Big Four and if you don't agree I suggest you listen to more than the first-page-of-"anthrax"-youtube.
p3583
aVMegadeth and Metallica
p3584
aVI know it's trendy to hate on Metallica and stuff but I have to say them, best metal band ever. I love the other 3 bands too.
p3585
aVI love all 4 of those bands, and have since the late 80s, but come on, put on a playlist of Master of Puppets, Orion, One, Creeping Death, and Call of Ktulu, and the other 3 bands combined can't compete with it.
p3586
aVIMO\u000a1. Metallica\u000a2.Megadeth\u000a3/4. Tie Anthrax and Slayer
p3587
aVHonestly it is hard to choose as they are all such incredible bands.\u000a\u000aEven thrash metal fans, those who think one of the bands is not "good enough" should go back and listen to all the albums because I assure you: you are wrong. They are all good and the term "big four" didn't come out of nowhere.
p3588
aVI really think that Metallica/Slayer should take the #1 spot in a tie, but the other 2 listed on there should be replaced with Exodus (especially Megadeth) as Exodus really represents to me what thrash metal should be about.\u000a\u000a
p3589
aVYou must not have listened to much Megadeth or Anthrax. Try listening to it again you'll change your mind.
p3590
aVI've listened to plenty of Megadeth, and the more I listen, the more I can't stand em, and I couldn't get into anthrax, they just don't seem to embody the vision of what thrash metal music should be. If you listen to Exodus-Another lesson in violence, that's what thrash metal should be.

aVI mean if you hate melody with good metal pausing and aggressive speed changes which is exactly what Megadeth and Anthrax are known for; then yes you won't like Megadeth or Anthrax.\u000a\u000aSome don't like the vocals so I can understand that.

aVHad to go with Megadeth. I kind of would have liked the "Other Big Four" (Testament, Exodus, Overkill and Kreator) to have been included, or have a separate poll all together.
p3595
aVMetallica easily. Not only are they te most successful, but they were the first breakout band in the sub-genre. \u000a\u000aAfter them, I'd probably list SLAYER followed by Anthrax then Megadeth (last two are more so my opinion)

V\u201cThe devil is in the detail,\u201d as the old saying goes. Translated to Sodom vocalist/bassist Tom Angelripper\u2019s sharp-tongued and highly critical powers of observation, you might also say: the worst perversions often hide behind seemingly harmless terms. What are we referring to? For example to \u2018Katjuscha\u2019, one of twelve hard-as-nails songs which Sodom present on their latest studio album, Epitome Of Torture. After all, Sodom\u2019s \u2018Katjuscha\u2019 has little to do with the same-named folk song by Mikhail Isakovsky, but is about the Russian rocket launcher which has been responsible for death and destruction thousandfold. \u201cThe Katjuscha has been produced since World War II and is still used today,\u201d the Sodom frontman explains. \u201cIt\u2019s been responsible for the death of more people than Stalin\u2019s organ. To name such a deadly weapon after a girl is as grotesque as giving the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima the code name \u2018Little Boy\u2019.\u201d It\u2019s obvious that Sodom 2013 haven\u2019t changed their scornful view of the world, presenting an album in Epitome Of Torture that is as uncompromising as ever in musical as well as lyrical terms. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s still plenty of inspiration for angry lyrics around,\u201d says Angelripper.\u000a\u000aThe bitter thrash metal attack \u2018Waterboarding\u2019, which deals with torture methods, fits perfectly into this context. \u201cIt always surprises me how inventive \u2013 in the most negative sense of the word \u2013 people can be when it comes to torturing others,\u201d states the vocalist, who recorded Epitome Of Torture together with guitarist Bernemann and new drummer Markus \u201cMakka\u201d Freiwald. \u201cAt the same time, Epitome Of Torture features not only typical Sodom numbers, like the title track, our new hit \u2018S.O.D.O.M.\u2019 and \u2018Stigmatized\u2019, the toughest Sodom number in ages, but also two or three recordings which are slightly more moderate and melodic than what people have come to expect from us,\u201d Tom Angelripper points out. He is referring to songs such as \u2018Cannibal\u2019 and \u2018Tracing The Victim\u2019, which allow guitarist Bernemann to present his impressive musical skills, as well as \u2018Into The Skies Of War\u2019, on which Angelripper allowed himself to be inspired by icons such as Motörhead and Tank: \u201cLuckily, it\u2019s impossible to hide my influences.\u201d\u000a\u000aEpitome Of Torture was produced by Waldemar Sorychta, whose expertise as a sound engineer and audio magician thoroughly benefitted Sodom\u2019s 2010 release In War And Pieces. Tom Angelripper: \u201cWaldemar is an exceptional producer, who always succeeds in evening out an artist\u017ds weak spot and promoting his strengths. He doesn\u2019t let you get away with anything, he knows all our weak spots. Which occasionally makes working at the studio a little demanding, but at the end of the day it\u2019s all worthwhile, as the result shows.\u201d The Sodom frontman describes the sound on Epitome Of Torture as \u201chard-as-nails and contemporary, without ignoring our tried-and-tested old-school attitude.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe new album will be available worldwide through SPV/Steamhammer in four different formats: as a limited-edition DigiPak including two bonus tracks and a poster, in a regular jewel case, as a double gatefold colored vinyl with three bonus tracks and for download. The cover artwork featuring Sodom\u2018s popular \u201cKnarrenheinz\u201dlogo was developed by graphic designer Meran Karanitant, who has caused a stir with his work for Six Feet Under, Hatebreed and Dimmu Borgir, among others.\u000a\u000a\u000aRelease Dates are: Germany April 26th, Europe April 29th and US/Canada May 7th!\u000a\u000aTracklisting:\u000a\u000aLimited Edition Digipak:\u000a\u000a1.
