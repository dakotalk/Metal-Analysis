sVLooking for more post metal like Russian Circles
p17
VI'm a huge fan of Cloudkicker (which I consider to be approximately at the fringe of post-metal, perhaps I'm wrong) and Russian Circles.\u000aI would like to listen to some things more like them.  Any suggestions, r/postmetal?\u000a\u000aEdit: some things I like about those mentioned above: to start with, I like the crispness of the overall sound.  It's a modern metal sound where it needs to be, but not over-saturated with gain.  \u000a\u000aI'm also very into time signatures, so if you know of any post metal groups that do strange time signatures well I would be particularly interested in those.

p23
VSo I've been lurking around here for awhile. I mostly hang around /r/postrock. I've been trying to clean out my music library, which is currently filled with stuff my friend had given me, and fill it with music I've found a taken a liking to. Post-Rock is still probably my favorite genre ever, but I haven't been giving Post-Metal, Shoegaze, Post-Hardcore, etc the attention they deserve. So right now I'm in the market to check out some more artists and broaden my horizons.\u000a\u000aSo name all your favorite bands, the best albums, songs, etc. If it help at all, my favorite band is *shels and though I really like ISIS's "In the Absence of Truth" I haven't heard much else by them (blasphemy, I know).\u000a\u000aThanks!

sVNew to this subreddit, thought I'd share some thoughts.
p70
VI found this amusing, being that as far as I know, Aaron Turner pretty much coined the phrase "Post-Metal", but check it out. Taken from an OMG interview for "NO".\u000a\u000a"AT: What is post-metal? Did metal end at some point? We don't recognize genre \u2013 we are beholden only to our own creative whims, desire only to use of sound as a tool for the manipulation of consciousness. If we can use our music to move ourselves and listeners beyond the confines of linear time and the widely accepted notion of three dimensional space, we will consider our efforts successful. Anything less is utter failure."\u000a\u000aI think he's also just fucking around with the interviewer a bit there, but it does make one think. I see reposts from this subreddit in r/sludge, r/doommetal, and more. \u000a\u000aTo me, post metal is more of a category for those who are less concerned with lumping bands into specific little sub-genres, and more of just a guideline to tunes metal-oriented, but aren't afraid to travel elsewhere.

VHey folks, \u000a\u000aHere in Salt Lake we just finished Crucial Fest, our local "Heavy" music festival.

We also have "doom and gloom fest" coming up, which is more post-metal friendly; This one sheds the punk and  adds a bit more sludge and doom.\u000a\u000aAnything like either of these happen near you?

VSomeone posted a comment a while ago saying that their favorite lyrics were from a track that my mind wants to say was from some incarnation of [Aaron Turner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Turner)'s music. I think the lyrics compared humans to rats and maybe plague, and it was a really heavy track, very Greymachine kind of sound. I thought it could be some Greymachine, Godflesh (its not "Like Rats"), or Old Man Gloom but came up empty-handed. Boy am I going to look stupid when it has nothing to do with Aaron Turner. \u000a\u000a Thanks for any help, I would love to hear this track again. (Or just post some songs with great lyrics!)

sVAny postmetal bands using non-conventional instruments?
p237
VHi r/postmetal,\u000aI'm relatively new to the genre and gearing up for the journey of discovery. As I was listening to some reddit-recommended albums, I had the thought that I'd really enjoy a strings-based band making postmetal, kind of like what Apocalyptica did for heavy metal. \u000a\u000aSo, expanding the concept, are there any postmetal bands/artists you'd like to recommend that use alternative/non-conventional instruments?\u000a\u000aHopefully this is not a dumb or terribly uninformed post, thanks for your understanding if it is.

sVWhat is your favorite Isis album, and why is it Panopticon? (Happy 10th anniversary to an amazing post metal album)
p304
VSorry for the joke in the title; I know that Panopticon is definitely not everyone's favorite album, but I thought it was only fitting since it is the 10th anniversary.\u000a\u000aAnyways, so, why do you like Panopticon/Isis? Sorry for the long winded journey about how I got into Isis, but I thought it would be cool to hear everyone's journey.\u000a\u000aSo I've always been a metal head, but I could never really get into the heavy, growling metal that everyone thinks of when they think of metal. I grew up listening to Metallica, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, and Pantera, and Pantera was definitely the heaviest vocals that I ever got into. Then about four years ago, my friend and I got a new roommate, and he was wearing an Opeth shirt. I'd heard of them, but I didn't know anything about them at the time. I asked him for some suggestions on where to start, and I was told to give Black Water Park a listen (of course). It took me a couple listens, but I fell pretty hard for Opeth. From there, I went to Still Life, Ghost Reveries, My Arms...., Watershed, and to Orchid and Morningrise. I really think that Opeth opened the way for me to listen to songs with growling vocalists.\u000a\u000aAnyways, it was about a year later, as I was getting into collecting records, that I decided I wanted to give Isis a try. I had actually seen them open for Tool back in 2006, and while I didn't know any of their songs, I still enjoyed their set. I kind of forgot about them until three years ago. So I made a post on /r/music asking people for any recommendations on Isis, and of course, two people posted (I was new to reddit and post-metal, so I didn't even think to look for /r/postmetal). The general consensus was to start mid-discography, unless I wanted to get into their more doomy stuff with Celestial, Mosquito Control, etc. For whatever reason, I ended up choosing Panopticon, and I don't know if I would have liked them if I hadn't started there.\u000a\u000aOnce the beginning of So Did We hit, I knew I was going to love this album. The beginning of the song is so brutal and heavy, and his growls just rattle your soul. And then the clean guitars kick in, and you just don't know where the song is going to go. Then the song builds again with heavy guitars, and then mellows out as the song fades into Backlit.  \u000a\u000aHaving never listened to Isis, but being a prog fan, I really liked the progressiveness of the album. There was a stark contrast between the distorted guitars and clean, reverb-y guitars, but then there are also mixes of them, and it's hard to distinguish what is going on. I think Isis did a really great job of the layering of the different tracks and having them build on top of each other to create this epic soundscape that really takes the listener to another place. The vocals can sometimes be so muted and faded that the music almost always takes the spotlight; and there are some really great instrumental sections on their songs, like the intros to In Fiction or Wills Dissolve, or the entirety of Altered Course. \u000a\u000aAnyways, thanks for reading this. Sorry if I started to ramble a bit at any point. I'm looking forward to hearing what you guys think as well.

sVAnyone interested in doing vocals for a post black metal project?
p380
VI've had ideas for a solo post black metal project for quite a long time, and it's now finally coming along. Sadly, I can't growl or sing at all. Therefore I'm wondering if someone here is capable at growling, and would like to do the vocals for the project? When it comes to the style of the vocals, I'm thinking harsh vocals in the vein of ISIS and Altar of Plagues.\u000a\u000aThe project is just starting up, but I'm planning on releasing an EP quite soon. Unless my music is too terrible, that is.\u000a\u000aYou can hear a four minute-demo of one of the songs I'm working on here: https://soundcloud.com/3rdfromthesun/four-minute-demo\u000a\u000aFeedback on the song is also appreciated.\u000a(Keep in mind that it is a demo of a longer song, and it's not mixed or mastered. The drums are also just a rough sketching, and bass has not been recorded yet.)

VI can pretty much accredit my still being alive to ISIS. I was at a super looow point in life and was almost to the point of giving in and calling it quits. Long before this a friend had given me Panopticon and insisted on me trying it out. One day I put my music library on shuffle so I could lay in bed and sulk. At some point Wills Devide came on and I FELT IT! I cant really put it into words. I listened to Panopticon on repeat for hours that night. This was 4 years ago and still to this day if im ever depressed ISIS will bring me out of it.

VOne of the best features of the genre: the slow build to enormous, world-crushing climax. Who's done it best? Post specific examples, and when checking out other songs, do them the justice of listening to the whole thing. Yes, it might take twelve minutes, but that's the point. You can't get the same impact by just skipping to the ending. \u000a\u000aOf course the legends have some deserving tracks, but I'll start off with two recent ones (below for separate vote-ability):

The rest of the line up is a work in progress as we speak (who knows - maybe i'll throw out a post on that topic later? Keep your eyes open redditors in the UK)\u000a\u000aBut to cut the chase - how do you go about writing songs? Some people come up with riffs in the shower. Others jam for hours. Whats your writing process? And how do you record/note down those sounds you come up with? \u000a\u000aWe're most of the way through our first song, but i just want to expand my thinking to avoid hitting any writing block

VI propose a challenge to the readers of this subreddit: at some point over the next week, take a half hour to go out and discover a new post metal band.  They don't have to be amazing, or even "new"; just new to *you*.  Then, of course, come back here and post them!\u000a\u000aLet's face it, this is a pretty obscure genre (as evidenced by this subreddit having only 605 subscribers!).  But there ARE a lot of bands out there, if you're willing to dig a little.  For me, I've found the best way to discover a new band is to go to youtube, look up a video from a band I like, then start checking out the related videos.  I've had a lot of success this way - I don't always find the most amazing bands, but at least it's something new!\u000a\u000aI'll get this started.  I was doing some digging this morning and came across some pretty interesting sludge-y post metal in [Destroy Judas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKhZoD2qA7Q).  If you like it, their [bandcamp page](http://destroyjudas.bandcamp.com/) has the album available for download at name your own price.

VIt's all in the title. I would really appreciate some direction. Thanks, friends! (p.s. I prefer instrumental stuff.)\u000a\u000aedit: that should be a question mark at the end of the title.\u000a\u000asecond edit: also, I didn't originally notice that "Intro to Post Metal" in the sidebar, so thanks for dealing with me haha.\u000a\u000athird edit: the type of stuff I'm most interested in is like Pelican's "What We All Come To Need" (album and the song itself). I haven't started on your guys's quite generous suggestions yet but I can tell from the comments that there is a lot more distinction within the postmetal subgenre than I realized. So I might be into what some of you have referred to as the "heavier postrock".

Otherwise, you will see the post you spammed back on the page.\u000a\u000aJust wanted to throw that out there. If you guys want to offer suggestions/any concerns/etc., let us know! This is our community, not the mods' community. Let's chat!

sV[The Mods Love you] Note to our friendly post-metallers...
p644
VHey guys,\u000a\u000aWe've noticed on particular user on here has been a real knobjob on here, and we've gone ahead and banned them.\u000a\u000aWE ARE NOT AFRAID TO BAN YOU.\u000a\u000aThis community was created to share our love of post metal. Yes, some things may not be TRUE post metal, but we don't care. If you post Shakira on here... ok... you're gonna get it removed. But if you want to post something that you feel is appropriate to this sub, then post it! Don't be afraid. If you feel like you are being harassed, or had something undeservedly reported, let your friendly Mods know.\u000a\u000aThere is no one definition of post metal. We all have our own interpretation. I, myself, have posted a lot of black post metal (or post black metal or shoegaze black metal or whatever) because I want people to know about it. If you post something by EITS, great! Maybe that song means something to you, and you want to share it. NOT EVERYONE KNOWS WHO EITS IS. Shit. I didn't hear of ISIS until well after I started listening to post metal. Shit happens.\u000a\u000aDon't be afraid to share with each other. All "post-metal" is welcome. Local bands, huge bands, news, tours, whoever. This is what this community is for, and we intend to keep it that way. So, let's share what we love.\u000a\u000aWe don't have many rules, but if you can't follow the few rules we have, then you will get banned.\u000a\u000aThe rules are in the sidebar, but here they are just for show:\u000a\u000a* Feel free to post anything revolving around post metal. Post black metal? Sure! Post hardcore? Bring it on! Post hardened crust death stomp? Never heard of it; why not!\u000a* If you are going to flag something, send the moderators a note! Otherwise, we will put it back!\u000a* Are you in a band? Want us to hear your stuff? Do you think it'd fit in here? Post it!\u000a* Got a problem? Message your lovable moderators!\u000a\u000aThanks again for everything, everyone! You guys all rule.

VHey guys,\u000a\u000aI was dicking around on the moderator shenanigans on the sidebar, and I noticed a cute little link called, "moderation queue." Struck my fancy. Took a look in there, and I saw a bunch of stuff in there that people flagged. Here's the problem I found.\u000a\u000aA lot of these flagged posts were legit, and I don't want people missing out on posts because someone decided to flag it. Now, it could have been an accident. I don't know. I was hoping you guys could start messaging us when you guys do flag stuff. We don't get any messages when someone flags a post, so those flagged posts just sit there, unnoticed.\u000a\u000aPlease give us the link title you flagged, and a reason why you flagged it. We want to make sure people aren't missing out on stuff. So, if we decide it's a valid flag, we'll leave it flagged. Otherwise, it'll come back into circulation.\u000a\u000aI know. It is kind of nazi-ish to throw this out like this, but we wanna make sure people are getting exposed to everything. Especially in such small community, we wanna make sure people are getting everything possible.\u000a\u000aYou guys can feel free to criticize! If you guys have better ideas for resolving this type of stuff, or if you have any issues, please, feel free to drop a line in this post. We wanna make sure we are working as a community to ensure this truly IS a community.\u000a\u000aLet us know!

I wonder if the bass parts being so good and high in the mix are what makes this record so great, among other things.\u000a\u000aIs there anything else out there like it?
