I love this new generation of bands growing up on Agalloch, the influence runs deep with this band; I imagine they got their name from In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion ("this pantheon of oak, this citadel of stone").\u000a\u000aThank you for turning me onto this band, next paycheck I'm buying an EP.

p345
(lp346
VSo what's your opinion?  I'm finding it pretty boring but I'm not all that surprised (for me, each subsequent album since Pale Folklore has been a small step down).  Love the Musk Ox tracks though.  Best track on first listen was Vales Beyond Dimension, or the last section of Plateau of the Ages.\u000a\u000aAgalloch is still a wonderful band after all these years..
p347
aVAfter a first listen, I think I like it. It's more subdued than anything else they've done, but it's also more intricate. There's a lot of subtlety there, which for me was sometimes lost in the noise in Marrow. I'll have to give it another 20 listens and see how I rank it against the others. And for the record, my favorite of theirs was Ashes Against the Grain. :)
p348
aVI'm looking forward to more listens, my opinion often changes on albums like this one.\u000a
p349
aVI agree. Agalloch is my all-time favorite band, but I don't find any of their stuff being as good as PF. Still, even the worst of Agalloch is playlistworthy for me.
p350
aVNice.. yeah most newer Agalloch fans don't appreciate Pale Folklore but to me its easily their best.  I love John Haughm's "imperfect" style of drumming and I think it suits the folk aspects of the music so well.  The first two albums are genuine masterpieces, and although I still enjoy the more recent stuff, it doesn't quite measure up in terms of allure, mystery, and charm.

p386
aVCouldn't agree with you more... It's a sad thing they currently seem to lack the inspiration to make a new album
p387
aVI think they're focusing on side projects more then anything. They've had long gaps like this before so I'm sure they'll resurface.
p388
aVI might be wrong, but I remember them saying that in one interview, after Oath bound... but I also believe they will resurface maybe next year maybe five, ten more, I only know that that one's anticipated :)

aVAwesome! Thanks for the tip. Can't wait.
p397
aVHe also said that he wasn't going to release anymore music in this style because people compared him too much to Agalloch and called his music "Hipster metal". Even goes as far as to say that he should never have released music he wrote in high school. \u000a\u000aI am really not sure what to expect of this release. Its a shame he let people get to him like that.
p398
aVI think he needs to pay more attention to the people who liked it and less to the people who didn't. Fuck those people. There's an entire genre like Agalloch and many of those bands are excellent. And, you know, found in this subreddit.
p399
aVThat is a shame. 
p400
aVThere is a sixth track that was released in the "Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer" compilation! Called Earthen Throne. Or if you already knew about that one you're probably missing the bonus track on Ashen Eidolon called Stone of Remembrance.\u000a\u000ap.s. I know your comment is 4 months old but I for one love discovering tracks I wasn't aware of by bands I love so just in case.

p431
aVVery nice! That is some awesome dirty KVLT recording. Definitely passing this around to my buddies.
p432
aVThanks man, much appreciated. We don't get much exposure, nor have I done a great job of promoting this. Anyways, here's the entire EP \u000a\u000ahttp://www.mediafire.com/?8svv61zbax991ms
p433
aVMuch appreciated! I know what I'm cranking today at work.
p434
aVWhy in german?
p435
aVI'm half German, used to live here in Berlin where I am on a brief vacation right now, been speaking the language for a very long time. I feel that it works very well with the black metal aesthetic....it's very strongly pronounced, with much accentuation is available to use, and in general I just really enjoy it. It's been something I've worked hard on for many years, and seeing as there's not really any market for me when I get my degree in 6 months, well...why not utilize what I've been studying for most of my life?
p436
aVThat's cool.  I was just wondering since it sounded like you were from the States.
p437
aVYeah, well I am definitely from the states. But, I guess you could say I grew up multikulti in a fairly isolationist country
p438
asVHoly crap, Agalloch has actual music videos, and they're awful.  Sad, really
p439
(lp440
VThis kind of thing is why I'm glad to be a music lover who doesn't give a shit for music videos. By anyone. Ever.
p441
aVAgalloch is such a thematic band that I can't help but have these amazing images in my mind while I listen, and then crap like this.  I agree, though.  I never watch videos on purpose.  I was actually just thinking of posting the song when I found it.
p442
aVThe images your mind fits to the music are all you need, as far as I'm concerned.\u000a\u000aI love Sigur Rós, for instance, and have never seen one of their videos. I would hate to have my own mental images of Saeglopur or Olsen Olsen replaced by anything.
p443
aVThe biggest sin in my mind isn't the video itself, it's the dire truncation of this song from an epic to god knows what.
p444
aVSo when the dude shouts "solstafir"?  It's the Icelandic word for this:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular_rays\u000a\u000aThe more you know!
p445
aVThere's actually a band named Solstafir and they just released probably the best atmospheric metal album of 2011 called Svartir Sandar.  \u000a\u000aedit: 2011, I'm not from the future, really
p446
aVReally?  Toss up a link and I'll definitely check em out\u000a
p447
aVhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es0CP2YC-M4\u000a\u000athat's the first song from the album\u000a\u000athey actually had a couple albums before this one, i've only heard the second one which came out in 2009 or so, sounded quite a bit like primordial.  it looks like they have stepped out of that shadow since then, however.
p448
aVI meant as a post to r/atmosphericmetal, but this works :)  Listening now
p449
aVAlright I'll make a post but for a different album.
p450
aVthe fact that such a word even exists in their culture says a lot about the natural phenomena they get to witness - and about the emotions that atm metal in general evokes   *daydream / heart swells*\u000a
p451
aVWhat don't you like about this video? It has everything I expect from them, really; natural landscapes and metal. I love this video. I don't enjoy that the song is cut and shortened, but that's my only complaint.\u000a\u000aIf you ever get the chance to see them live do it. You won't be disappointed.

aVWhile I'm sure this idiot won't answer you, due to his being best buds with the band members and all, but according to [Northern Silence](http://northern-silence.de/index2.htm) there is finally a Gallowbraid album in the works, due out some time this year.  No title and no date, but one can hope.  They have added it to their releases for 2015 and have cataloged it (NSP134).

VSo for serious, what is it about SLC that produces interesting atmospheric metal bands? I used to think it was all the guy from Gallowbraid doing different projects, but now I'm thinking that's not accurate. Gallowbraid, Caladan Brood, Ered Wethrin, and now this. I think there's one more that I'm forgetting about.
p774
aVwell, the funny thing about slc is that we have a music scene that is very alive in all aspects. Music from all genres is constantly being created and performed. Metal is no exception by any means, but the funny thing about what you said is that my roommate happens to play the lead guitar in a band with one of the gentleman who is behind the projects of calladan brood, gallowbraid etc. so I have totally met him and he is great! Yes salt lake seems lame, but in reality it's awesome and we have a swarm of great music here haha. I'm really hoping to keep making more in the near future here.\u000aedit:just realized I posted this w/ my regular account haha. whelp I guess the secrets out
p775
aVI'm from Utah, actually, although I live in Texas now, and it seems like all this stuff started happening after I moved :/
p776
aVHmmm when did you leave? As far I know that guy has been making those projects for quite sometime. As far all this music gong in it has always been that way. I suppose you become more aware of it as you yourself play in groups, and just get older in general. Know what I'm saying? 
p777
aVYa. I moved at the beginning of 2013, but I already knew about Gallowbraid. The others have come out since then, and I didn't find out Gallowbraid was from SLC until I moved here. Looking forward to seeing what else my home state comes up with :)
p778
aVSince you're some kind of insider, can you tell me if Gallowbraid has a site where I can buy their MP3s or something? All I could find was an album on Amazon that said it had to be imported.

p787
aVI definitely like Heathen dream, really nice atmosphere and a nice variety in the songwriting, also very good vocal performance. The other two songs sounds really promising too, I will keep an eye on this..\u000aMaybe a little bit to warm sound, would like louder cymbals, but that's just a minor taste issue.. and the only negative thing I can say about this, nicely done!
p788
aVHeathen Dream is probably my favourite too. \u000a\u000aThanks for the feedback! I agree with you about the drums, but I am very limited because they were done using a drum program. Ideally I would record them properly, but I can't really afford it. :(

p839
aVI agree completely... the post was at 0 when I commented, just wanted to preface that I wasn't the cunt that did it.  Happens all the time, less so here but all the time in /r/blackmetal.
p840
aVYou're definitely not the only one, and I see why its polarizing. Personally, I wish there were more like this. I've got a lot of other artists in the same playlist that share a lot of commonality but lack the leads that originally drew me to Ghost Bath. 
p841
aVI've heard nothing but praise for them (at least on here, I don't read many blogs or other forums - I have an aversion to most critics and reviewers, with a few exceptions).  Anyway I'll give this a listen, of course, but I found the debut boring.  Nothing against the genre so you never know, subsequent listens might change my opinion.
p842
aVUnfortunately if you didn't like the debut I don't think you will like this at all. All the other songs share many of the some qualities. My biggest gripe with the album is that almost half of it feels like an interlude.

p923
aVI like that initiative, I'll try to help, it would be really sad to see this subreddit die. And also to post bands that everyone (every 3-5 people visiting this subreddit) already is familiar with would reduce us to a obscure version of most other music-subreddit. And that's not our goal is it?

aVI think you're up in the night. Ashes Against the Grain was amazing. This kinda sounds like they're going back to that after the grungy experimental thing they had going on in Marrow of the Spirit wasn't as well-received.\u000a

aVI was referring to Marrow of the Spirit and Faustian Echoes... I love Ashes against the Grain!\u000a
p1225
aVOh gotcha :)
p1226
aVGrungy experimental? Did we even listen to the same album? It was a return to a much more black metal influenced sound and Faustian Echoes went even further in that direciton
p1227
aVOkay grungy might have been the wrong word. Not grunge as in Nirvana. Grunge as in over distorted to the point where I had to check several times to make sure I was listening to the a legit copy because it sounded badly ripped and oversampled at first. I got used to it. I like the album. Still, probably their least good in my opinion.

VI'm not sure if atmospheric but this song definitely kicks ass! I like the sound of the snare but the guitars could be mixed slightly better. Thanks for the post! 
p1275
aVYou're probably right.. this album is a classic at this point, I figured it might be appreciated here.
p1276
aVI highly suggest you try listening to the album from the beginning. It's one of those albums that got progressively better for me each time I heard it. The mixing and atmosphere of this album make it a bit inaccessible at first, but it's a very intentional sound that makes itself more apparent after a few listens. A very cold sound.\u000a\u000aThis is indeed an atmospheric black metal classic that everyone should at least be somewhat familiar with, IMO.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Link to the full album: [Nocternity - Onyx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FuYZL5UiBM). Stay for the intro at least!
p1277
aVOver the years its worked its way into the company of the very most rarefied black metal albums.. It really is a beast.  Its a mystery as to why there is not more output from them, a couple songs here and there every few years and little more (and nothing coming even close to the sound nor the quality of Onyx).\u000a\u000aMy favorite thing about this album is easily the drums.. so close to just obliterating everything else, its a rampaging battery of sound that perfectly suits the mood and style of the guitars/vocals.  I will always come back to this album.
p1278
aVOne of my favorite black metal albums! Also my favorite track on the album. This is definitely atmospheric, which isn't synonymous with slow/ambient! The guitar tone is perfectly mixed for an icy wall of sound, and almost nothing comes close to the sound Nocternity achieves.\u000a\u000aI have to say, it took me some time to "come around" to the Nocternity sound, but this is the song that eventually captured me.
