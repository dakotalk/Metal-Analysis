aVYou might like Dimmu's latest album Abrahadabra. It is filled with orchestral music, similar to Progenies' sound. You might also like the band Carach Angren.
p100
aVProud owner of their entire discography here and I've seen them live a few times.  \u000a\u000aCan 100% confirm that this is their best album.  The sound is really amazing.  
p101
aVCan you pinpoint what it was that you like about this song specifically? If it's Vortex' harmonies that juxtapose the screaming, then I'd recommend Arcturus, listen to "the chaos path" on YouTube.  If it's the grandeur in the mix between orchestral parts and metal, then get some Bal-Saggoth.  You can also never, ever go wrong with Carach Angren.

p155
aVCheck out [Encyclopaedia Metallum](http://www.metal-archives.com/), they have every metal band known to man on there (death/metalcore not included). This is pretty much the universally accepted "encyclopedia" of metal bands. In this case, they define Gojira -- whom I fucking love btw, I've been listening to their two most recent albums at work -- as "Progressive/Groove/Death Metal." They are hard to define, but there's no doubt they're a progressive *something.* Personally I would almost call them post-death metal, in the same way At the Drive-In is post-hardcore, but I don't think such a genre has been "created."

p246
aVStart with Dimmu Borgir's Abrahadabra. The production quality is great. Gateways is my favorite song by far, with an amazing climax.
p247
aVI don't want to step all over your opinion. But please do not do this..\u000a\u000aPersonally I feel like the quality of that band dropped significantly after "In Sorte Diaboli". Two incredibly important people in that band left before Abrahadabra. The release of that album was probably the most disappointing releases I've ever heard.
p248
aVThat's a great opinion, buddy, but I'll do as I please.

aVNo one does it better than Dimmu Borgir!

aVAll the Vesania albums are well produced, fire frost arcanum being my favorite. Abigail Williams gets a lot of hate but any of their albums after the legend ep are solid releases. The first 3 grave worm albums are good too. There's also some more recent bands like aquilius, advent sorrow and Saturnian.

p298
aVI really like old Dimmu. They changed their music and image to something that I think makes them look and sound pretty silly.\u000a\u000aI hear what you're saying though, new DB isn't nearly as bad as most people make it out to be. Just not my thing.
p299
aVExactly. Thank you so much for saying that. "Just not my thing". That's just it.
p300
aVThere's nothing wrong with any music anyone listens to, it's all based on taste. We all have our own elitist moments and judge bands too harshly. Maybe some are just being elitist because they don't want to be singled out by others or maybe they're just afraid of trying out new sounds. Everyone has them, but it doesn't mean YOU have to stop listening to what you want to listen to.  \u000aIf someone bashes your music then they're just shallow, if you bash their music back then you're just as shallow as them. We all just need to accept that there's all types of different flavors. We will get nowhere bickering about who's better or who sucks, it's all opinion.\u000a\u000aedit: Also, Dimmu grew outside of the box and made actual money off their recordings just like Cradle of Filth. If you're angry because someone expanded on a genre and made it mainstream then you're just a cunt. That's all musicians and bands do, expand on their sound. Just because a band makes a break or ends up on a Top 50 list doesn't mean they sold out, they're making a living doing what they love and I think that's all anyone could ever ask for.
p301
aVWell said.
p302
aVThanks man! I just love music and hate seeing it ripped apart all of the time. I listen to copious amounts of genre's and people give me shit constantly. I know where you're coming from and there's no reasoning for anyone to act that way.   \u000aWhatever happened to "If you don't have anything nice to say then don't say it"?
p303
aVI really like Dimmu Borgir.  I like their old albums I like their new albums.\u000a\u000aI hate when people say I wish a band would put out an album like their first one etc. If you like a bands older albums listen to them,  but if they keep putting out cds that are exactly the same I would get tired of the bands very quickly.  like it when a band tries new things and evolves.  
p304
aVTHANK YOU for this!!! I don't think that they've gotten better over the years, but I can't think of a single album that I truly dislike by them. I loved Abrahadabra. And that's really controversial because black metal is my favorite style of music. So most of the people i talk to that are black metallers really give me a lot of shit every time i mention Dimmu. I know the metal parts of the new shit is very simple compared to the older days, but i dont have a problem with the symphonics taking the spotlight in some cases. 
p305
aVThank you. I hold the **extremely** unpopular opinion that Dimmu Borgir's music has gotten consistently better and better with each release, and I actually dislike the older, traditional "this is how black metal is supposed to sound" music. I don't understand that mentality at all. I think it's very closed minded. \u000a\u000a   I for one like progression and imagination. Generic tremolo licks atop unchanging blast beats with indecipherable vocals don't do it for me at all. A band sounding like an amazing dark orchestra does. My only argument is this: The newer Dimmu Borgir music that everyone hates... paints fucking PICTURES in my brain. I see landscapes. I envision scenes. It makes me perceive colors and shapes. You can't argue how it makes me feel with statistics and a perception of what you think *they* should be doing in *their* art. \u000a\u000a It's just aesthetically pleasing to *me.* Period.\u000a\u000a
