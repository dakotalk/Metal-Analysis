sVQuestion: What type of imagery does listening to some of your favorite Doom bring to mind?
p28
VFor example, sometimes when I am really high and following the smoke to the riff filled lands I picture a man (much stronger and badass looking than I) standing on a beach just smashing coconuts with a baseball bat hundreds of yards out into the ocean. Through storms and fair weather day and night just sending coconuts flying. People ask him what he is doing and all he ever says is "waiting." \u000a\u000a\u000aOne day (usually when the guitars cut out and it's just a funk bass riff caring my mind to the deepest darkest emptiest places of outerspace) a huge storm comes in and shit starts looking really gnarly, but this dude is just standing there with his baseball bat just mean mugging the shit out of the ocean. Well as the bass starts playing a little heavier and some guitar feedback comes screeching through a god damn comet hits the ocean and creates a fucking massive tidal wave. As the guitar starts playing the same riff as the bass and the drummer starts whaling on the cymbals, a smile creeps across this guys face and he gets his baseball bat into position. \u000a\u000a\u000aWaves start beating down on this guy and he is just waiting for the big wave to come in. And as this like 100ft wave approaches he exhales and goes to swing. And the point is not about if he can or can not repel a wave, the point is he is heavy enough to fucking try. \u000a\u000a\u000aThats how doom makes me feel.

VHere at /r/doommetal we try to be inclusive rather than exclusive and to that aim we have created the Green List. You will probably begin to notice links that have been tagged with the Green List flair soon. This list will include tracks that have been posted many times over the years. The purpose of the Green List is to encourage metal veterans to suggest other music the submitter might like based on the users submission. Instead of just removing links that were posted by newcomers to the genre, we want to make an event of it. We don't want the submitter to feel like they've done something wrong, because they haven't. We want to welcome them instead. We don't want to alienate newcomers who are trying to share a cool track, and we think we have the right kind of community to pull it off. \u000a\u000aFor the current Green List please check the sidebar. \u000a\u000a

p122
VI'm a big fan of lots of different types of music, including classical. One of my favourite pieces is Sergei Rachmaninov's "[Prelude in C# minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXQCPAR0EHo)". Around the time I heard this, I was getting into Sabbath, Electric Wizard et. al. and the dark chords in this piece really spoke to me. I was also getting into prog rock, especially Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, who "heavied" up classical pieces, such as Bartok's "The Barbarian", Prokofiev's "Dance of the Knights" and Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition". I thought it would be really cool if a metal band would cover the Prelude in C# minor!\u000a\u000a\u000aJump forward a few years and there I am, getting into Dutch progressive rock, and I stumble upon an LP by Ekseption. I recognised one track straight away - it was [their take on the Prelude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaQ1_DWrFkg)! My main problem with their rendition, and indeed with most of their material, is the extensive use of horns. But it was heading towards what I had envisaged from years before.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNot long afterwards, I found out a bit more about doom metal, and I also discovered a doom metal band covered the Ekseption song. From their 2006 album, The Burning Halo, Draconian offered up what [I had been looking for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y06P8KpzsVA). Personally I wish it didn't have the harsh vocals, but that's just my preference. It's still a great rendition.\u000a\u000a\u000aSorry for the long post but when I'm not working, I'm bored.

Sewed on myself by hand, DIY style (as every metal jacket should be). The patch is available [here](http://holymountainprinting.bigcartel.com/product/pallbearer-goat-head-back-patch) for $10. I can personally confirm the quality, so far there is little fraying and the material is a sturdy heavy canvas. \u000a\u000aIt really doesn't have to be said for this subreddit, but if you are going to criticize remember that **constructive criticism is always the best kind**.

VI'm aware of such bands as [Uaral](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Uaral/25123) and [Corrupted](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Corrupted/17630) both of which have some neo-folk influences but don't really embrace the full neo-folk sound like some other non-metal bands that I'm aware of (e.g. [Nebelung](https://nebelung.bandcamp.com/) or [Raflum](https://raflum.bandcamp.com/)).\u000a\u000aWhat I like most about neo-folk is the soft, melancholic sad sound, and the strong association with nature that is often present in the lyrics and ambient sounds (e.g. running water).\u000a\u000aAll subgenres of Doom are acceptable to me, just so long as there is some definite neo-folk influence. Let me know if more examples are necessary.

sVJust getting into Doom, but there's some I love and some I don't...Can anyone point me in the right direction?
p481
VI've loved metal for a long time, though I'd always been an old school thrash fan.  Over the summer, a friend took me to see [Iron Heel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2bsVw57bRA) and I was fucking blown away.  Since then I've been trying to find other doom I can get into, and while I've found lots that I like, it's not scratching my specific itch.  I like Crowbar, but they're too fast.  I like Sons of Otis but they're too psychedelic.  I like Electric Wizard, but they're not riffy enough.  I like Negative Reaction, but I think I like them because I love thrash and groove.  Other than Iron Heel, the only bands I've heard that really hit the spot are Pallbearer and Sleep.\u000a\u000aSo, I think the things I'm looking for are riffy, slow bands with clean vocals.  Anyone got any recommendations?

sVwhy I love Ufomammut
p591
Vthere's a moment in most Ufomammut songs when it really just kicks in. most of you probably know what I mean: the song builds and builds, and there's a moment when the effects and distortion all come together. you headbang a little harder at this part, and it continues for a few bars. \u000a\u000athen it REALLY happens. the song straight up goes nuclear, almost catching you off guard. the bass increases, and the mixing almost seems to shift into the back of your head. this part is what truly makes the buildup all worth it.\u000a\u000aEDIT: example - at about 2:40 of "Oroborus"\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avNHxMRhrx0#t=150

p629
VI live in a condo and I can't turn my shit up because of neighbors, therefore that means no bass, no noise, no doom. So I need some headphones that will go so fucking loud that I will go buttfuck insane from the sheer amplitude of doom. So bottom line is, I need a FUCKLOAD of bass, and they have to be able to reach completely ludicrous volume without\u000aa) exploding\u000ab) melting\u000ac) blowing or\u000ad) getting all distorted and shit\u000a If someone could help it would be much appreciated.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Ok guys, most of that was for comical exaggeration, but I'm still looking for some loud headphones, I know better than to go too crazy with it.

Heck, I'll even come see your band.\u000a\u000aI prefer Death/Doom, Gothic/Doom, and Funeral Doom.\u000a\u000aHelp a fellow metalhead out?\u000a\u000aI wish My Dying Bride, Draconian, or Swallow the Sun were touring the States right now.\u000a\u000aAnyway, thanks!

sVYour top 5/6/42 doom albums of all time?
p738
VPretty simple. I saw the r/Doommetal's best albums of 2014, but I realized I really didn't dig anything that came out this year that much. I remember looking back at an indie thread that had the concept of best albums of this year recorded in any other year, but not quite what I'd like to go with. But yeah. Your favorites? I'll start.\u000a\u000a#1: [DOPESMOKERRRRR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIw7oeZKpZc)\u000aThe heaviest thing in existence. Nothing else should ever be in this spot.\u000a#2: Windhand's Soma. I can't find a full album on youtube, but check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE7aB95aTFE) out. Approximately half a Dopesmoker long, so I guess it's worthy of its own place.\u000a#3: [Church of Misery's Thy Kingdom Scum](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeVcTgilDeCnCH922OaL0gO2zNpxVtBL1)\u000aJapanese doom metal about serial killers. Can you get any more metal than that?\u000a#4: [Pallbearer, Sorrow And Extinction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBJfHuyGpsI) \u000aNo explanation needed.\u000a#5: Electric Wizard's Come My Fanatics. \u000aCan't find a stream for this one either, but hey. Take a nice [Return Trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVGcRNotCAE)\u000a#6: [Cough, Ritual Abuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ_aHEOerpY)\u000aCough reminds me of Electric Wizard but with a sort of tortured agony in the sound. Just dark, and heavy, and hopeless.\u000aYay for not having full albums on youtube. Maybe I should fix that. \u000aSo, your picks?
p739
sVWriting lyrics [discussion]
p740
VSo I've been working on some songs for a new band. Musically, it feels so naturally playing/writing this type of music and some songs I've been working on already have lyrics but my question is, what is a good approach for writing doom metal lyrics? I've written about things such as addiction, disease, depression, and death. It's just that I can only write about the same thing so many times before it's all the same, you know? \u000a\u000aHow do you write in a way that fits the style without letting it all sound the same? As well as how to avoid sounding too angsty too of course.

VI've been giving Electric Wizards discography a good playthrough and I am loving it. I've tried listening to sunn o))) before but couldn't really fit into it. In looking for stuff that is; slow,  heavy and crushing (so basically doom metal). I've read the required listening thread and I'm going to start their when I can get to it all. What got me into wanting to get into slow and heavy music is a new band(not doom per say,  more sludgy prog death)  called alkaloid, pretty good. I've also been a fan of crowbar for a while and of course sabbath my whole life pretty much. Sorry for the rant. \u000a\u000aTl;Dr new to doom and looking for some tasty and doomy riffs.

sVLooking for modern doom with clean female vocals- any suggestions?
p1062
VOutside of symphonic metal, which I'm not a fan off, female vocals are extremely rare in metal. \u000a\u000aThe only doom band I can think of with clean female vocals is Blood ceremony, and they're a bit vintage sounding for my tastes.\u000a\u000aCan anyone recommend any more modern sounding stuff, with clean female vocals (Electric wizard, but with female singing is essentially what I'm after)

sVAnyone else pre-order Holy Mountain from Earache yet?
p1096
VHonestly, I almost didn't want to order it through them, just so that I wasn't supporting Earache's shadiness surrounding what is a near perfect release and what is one of my all time favorite records period. Then I thought to myself how absurdly priced these things will be on ebay. So fuck it, I got one of the blue/black's out of /200 They've already sold out of all colors but black. I'll happily go see SLEEP the next time they're in NY and give them all of my money that way. Anyone score a green copy??
