p30
aVOh, is that so?  Tell me then, how did it die? You seem pretty knowledgeable based on your post. 
p31
aVHow does anything die? Too many low-quality bands that don't understand the genre making pale imitations.

aVWhat is black metal?\u000a\u000aForgive the lateness of the replies, I'm in a very busy state, catering to the rats, I will attempt replies as I am able. I am most interested in a serious discussion on this issue.\u000a\u000aThe linked bands I gave, how are they "low-quality pale imitations"? I am curious, I am not attacking you.\u000a\u000aLow quality to me means Cradle of Filth or some such bullshit passing as "kvlt" &amp; such popular interweb scene BS. \u000a\u000aTo me, black metal must be black, elitist, and most importantly; anti-human. \u000a\u000aI do enjoy the old "true" black metal bands of the early 90's as much as the next nobody, but surely the spirit of black metal hasn't died. We are still here, frowning, existing. We aren't popular, we never really intended that.\u000a\u000awtfimdrunk, trying to make sense, nite\u000a \u000a\u000a
p33
aVI should have made clear I do not know most of the bands you linked.\u000a\u000aBlack metal is epic melodic atmospheric death metal, if you want a one-line definition.\u000a\u000aIt's form of Romantic art, like Blake, Bruckner, Goethe, Wordsworth, et al.\u000a\u000aAnything that falls short of that, or too far short of these classics, is probably not worth the time:\u000a\u000a* Immortal - Pure Holocaust\u000a* Emperor - Wrath of the Tyrant\u000a* Burzum - Det Som Engang Var\u000a* Rotting Christ - Thy Mighty Contract\u000a* Gorgoroth - Antichrist\u000a* Enslaved - Vikinglgr Veldi\u000a* Mayhem - De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u000a\u000aThese bands are intense.\u000a\u000aMost post-1994 black metal is like post-1985 hardcore, form without content and thus, has no real atmosphere or intensity.

VHmm, I'll try to get more submissions to this subreddit. Although I dislike ANUS, a subreddit where people read ANUS has to be intellegent. The thing about ANUS is the needless verbosity. There is no reason to express ideas in such a manner unless you are trying to show that you are intellectually superior or else trying to write poetry. If it is trying to be poetic, then it is quite pathetic, so I just have to assume that they are trying to pretend they are intellectually superior by using bigger words. The website just screams "My cock is larger than yours." For example:\u000a\u000a&gt; His technique combines the modern fascination with layers, or repeated complimentary patterns started at different times, and the ancient concept of recursion, where each repetition participates in the re-uptake of information from its context, finally forming a synthesis. \u000a\u000aThe "re-uptake of information from its context"? Even I don't know exactly what that is suppossed to mean. Definitely not musical terminology, which is generally the best way to present ideas in a music review. And isn't layering a form of recursion? Take part, add complimentary part, making new part. Repeat. So what, is this a synthesis between 2 things which are the exact same? Or is the reviewer saying there is a synthesis between the parts, thus making this whole sentence twice rednudant? \u000a\u000aWhat he could have said is "*This music uses the technique of layering, or adding in complimentary repeating parts at different times, in a manner which produces a strong synthesis between the combined parts.*" He could then go on to say "*His use of the looping structures in a narrative fashion is a nod to classical and baroque structures*" instead of the next monstrosity of a sentence. Of course, that isn't a nod to classical and baroque structures at all (at most a nod to the concept of counterpoint), but at least it would be a sentence that makes sense and isn't difficult to read. \u000a\u000aMaybe ANUS hides their ideas in abstruse rhetoric in order to filter out the idiots, but for me at least it also filters out the fun of earnest intellectual conversations without pretensiousness, but rather just the exchange of ideas.
p157
aVI think it's designed to be semi-poetic.\u000a\u000aThey write more about it here:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.anus.com/metal/about/\u000a\u000ahttp://www.anus.com/metal/about/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=63
p158
aV&gt; He dazzled them with his never-ending vocabulary, and I think this actually helped them understand what he said: They had to make sense of it before reacting.\u000a\u000aThat's actually a very interesting idea. It doesn't seem to be true, most people just look at an ANUS review, scratch their heads, and leave. I imagine it's the same with people like buckley. I would love for a site that doesn't insult it's readers but rather expects intelligence from them. That doesn't mean to me that you have do do it the way ANUS does it. I think you're right that it is supposed to be semi-poetic. Perhaps it'd be nicer if they just ditched all pretense and wrote poems for their reviews? I like how they argue that they are following the traditions of other metal bands by using such latinate technical words. It seems great when I read their defense of it, but then I look at those reviews, and no, it isn't really. I think of the einstein quote: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." Of course, it isn't true all the time, but I think as a rule of thumb it really helps.

aVJust came across this but it's an Icelandic wolf cross.\u000a\u000a"Wolf cross is found in Iceland, dated to about 900 AD One can not say with certainty to what meaning the wolf cross had. There are several theories: - An extremely stylized Thor's hammer. - A mixture of Thor's hammer and the Christian cross. - In case of navigation. That in the middle of the cross was mounted a so-called "Sunstone" Vikings used iolite stone, also known as "sunstone" for navigation. It acts as a polarizer and one can with the help of this blue stone determine the sun's location at the overcast weather."
