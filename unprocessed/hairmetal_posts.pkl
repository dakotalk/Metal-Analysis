VHi guys.\u000a\u000aSteel Panther are playing in my city soon and I'd love to go in full regalia this time. Problem is it's proving to be a bit of a problem finding the proper clothes.

VI'm pretty new to reddit, so what do we have to do? Plenty of people listen to hair metal, hair bands, glam metal. I know you bastards are out there. It's not like we're running out of songs; I did several searches and made a list of great stuff that's never been posted. I'll try to administer it in daily to bi-daily doses.\u000a\u000aLet's get this shit rockin!

VJust saw them this weekend. Interesting format of getting a bunch of singers together to do a show. Had Mark Slaughter, the Nelson twins, Eric Martin, Janet Gardner, and Kip Winger there.  \u000aThere were some hiccups, but overall was a good show. Worst hiccup was that it sounded like everyone there was playing and singing in a different key for Love and Affection.  \u000aEric Martin tore it up, I thought. Oddly enough with Matthew Nelson playing bass all night (except for when Winger was on) they did not play Addicted to that Rush.  =P\u000aWinger had the crowd going as well. Looking at the potential lineups, I could have enjoyed Stephen Pearcy and/or Joey Lynn Turner as well.  \u000aSo, if you hear they are in your area, could be worth it to just get the hits from them.

sVPlease help me identify this 80/90's hair metal music video and custom guitar.
p257
VI recall watching a music video in ~1991-1992 in which a guitarist played a green electric guitar with a painting of a woman on it.\u000aIt was for a late 80's/early 90's hair metal band like Guns N Roses, Poison, Aerosmith, etc.\u000aTo my memory the guitar was a simple Fender-style guitar with dark green paint; the illustration of the woman was in the 1950's pin-up tradition, as seen on tattoos and WWII planes.\u000a\u000aI feel like the guitar was either an integral part of the story in the music video, or it held my interest as a child because the guitarist was treating the guitar sensually, perhaps because he was comparing it to a woman.\u000a\u000aMy initial memory was that Slash from Guns N Roses was playing this guitar, and that he threw it off a cliff in the music video. Upon relating the story to a friend, he challenged this version of the story, saying that Slash played nondescript guitars, while saying that he vaguely remembered the green guitar I described.\u000a\u000aA subsequent Google Image search revealed that the scene I remembered of Slash casting his guitar off of a tall rock formation appeared in the video for 'November Rain,' and it was indeed a different guitar, Slash's trademark 'plain' Les Paul.\u000a\u000aThe last thing I have to add about this guitar is that, as a child, I had the impression that it was a "famous guitar"... it was someone's trademark guitar, and I may have even seen it featured by itself in 'Hit Parade' magazine.\u000a\u000aSo, who owned this beguiling guitar, and what music video was it featured in?
