VBored and drunk on a Sunday morning, I decided to link some videos of some of my favorite underground/obscure black metal bands for your enjoyment or your anguish.

p31
Vhttp://imageshack.us/a/img687/3556/hellsheadbangerscompila.jpg\u000a\u000a"Following, in the footsteps of and paying tribute to the 80's Metal Underground, Hells Headbangers Records has compiled and unleashed a compilation that acts not only as a taste of what the label has to offer, but also showcasing many of the underground Metal Scene's up and coming bands that may have gone under the radar otherwise.\u000a\u000aHHR has brought forth into the modern day Metal scene the idea and belief that no matter if a release is that of a single band, that it should be presented with the same care of a normal (for lack of a better term) release. Refusing to hastily slapping together a Cd sampler with random tracks and little to no artwork, HHR has reinstated the presentation of the compilation sampler being no different than any other release under bearing their logo.\u000a\u000aWith that in mind, the label approached the multi-talented underground artist, label boss and musician Antichrist Kramer to create the artwork to this release. The idea was to, and is to follow on all subsequent future compilations from the label, present the compilation with a reworking of and homage to a classic and highly iconic and recognizable Metal cover artwork from the past, albeit with the entire text and aesthetic changed to that of HHR and their Demon headed mascot.\u000a\u000aHHR decided that the perfect album to pay respect and honor to for the first of the new Compilation releases, was one of the most influential and groundbreaking Extreme Metal albums of all time: SLAYER's "Show No Mercy". An album that all involved feel encompasses every single aspect of what Metal is, should and forever will be. The idea was presented to Kramer (of whom when asked, ranked SLAYER's "Show No Mercy" as his personal favorite album hands down and "most important album of all time, regardless of artist or genre"), and within the span of weeks, he created a piece that not only at first glance replicates the entire artwork flawlessly, but delivered a piece of art that has the same initial impact of that which it pays honor to.\u000a\u000aDrawn, inked and colored completely by hand without a single touch of a computer program, Kramer delivered exactly what HHR were looking for. The original piece was created with pen and ink, colored pencil, markers and watercolor, and brings to the feeling and aesthetic of the original artwork to life in a way that computer generated artwork can never ever replicate. The SLAYER album and its artwork were created at the dawn of the birth of Extreme Metal, and for those there during this time period, it is greatly agreed upon that the feelings and powerful ideas that were coming to fore at this time can never be explained fully nor captured in this day and age. HHR and Kramer have absolutely done so with this release.\u000a\u000aReplacing the key elements of the artwork with those of the label, the artwork is now re-imagined as a new piece, yet still wholly familiar and exacting in its presentation. The Baphomet creature is now replaced with the HHR Demon whose belt buckle now says "HHR", the sword pentagram now with "HHR" entangled within, and the devil tailed blazing album title now reads "Hells Headbangers". This artwork will most assuredly be remembered and seen as one of the all time best reworkings/homage/tribute pieces in all of Metal. No matter who you are, what micro-genre you are into, SLAYER and "Show No Mercy" in particular, influenced you, either directly or indirectly. Hells Headbangers Records and Antichrist Kramer proudly proclaim this with this modern day soon to be classic release.\u000a\u000aHHR made sure to let the public know that this artwork and idea was completed and done before Hanneman's passing, and that Kramer delivered the final piece to HHR mered DAYS before news broke of the tragic event. Whether or not unseen forces and hands had a play in this will never be known, but what is known for sure is that a more fitting tribute could not have been made.\u000a\u000aThe compilation consists of 20 TRACKS IN TOTAL, and features brand new songs from upcoming albums by MIDNIGHT, WITCH CROSS, PROFANATICA, IMPIETY as well as material from earlier releases in 2013 and mid-late 2012. Many may have received this album in Cd format as a added bonus early in the summer when ordering from the label, but with the format and presentation that it now is being presented within, makes it a "must have" release regardless or not if you already have the free Cd version. Seeing the artwork at the at close to full scale that it was created at, along with the massive A2 poster featuring the same, allows one to appreciate the detail and devotion that went in to this piece on a level that was not possible on the Cd format. That alone is worth the price of admission.\u000a\u000aReleased and now for sale for a mere $12, with the option of purchasing with an accompanying Lp slipmat featuring the artwork, this amazing release is now available for worldwide shipping. Absolutely buy this release and support the label and artist, as this is Metal to the fucking bone, and a release such as this came at a time when it was greatly needed. 'Nuff said.\u000a\u000aOne final note, HHR and Kramer have informed me that the label and artist are working on more reworkings of classic albums for future compilations now, with the next cover to be "done and in the hands of HHR soon". None would divulge what the cover that is being paid tribute to is, but the one thing anyone can know for sure is that whatever it is, it will be something jaw dropping." - Michael Sanchez for The Metal Underground Radio Show\u000a\u000aYou can buy the 2Lp, the slip mats and shirts with the artwork here:\u000ahttp://shop-hellsheadbangers.com/hells-headbangers-compilation-volume-6-vinyl.asp?utm_source=Hells+Headbangers+Mailing+List&amp;utm_campaign=bb824839ba-HHR_DISTRO_UPDATE12_14_2013&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f82cdc0965-bb824839ba-91401197\u000a\u000aI am already working on the next compilation cover, and it will be done shortly after the new year. HHR and I have many plans for what bands/albums will be paid tribute to on these compilations.
