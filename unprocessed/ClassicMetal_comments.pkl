One gets the feeling that *of course* it's by a popular metal band, because, as with St. Anger, the riffs are boring.  I feel like people who wear that album on their shirts are novices to metal, the dabbler type who like Slipknot and other impure metalcore/nu metal stuff; they aren't in it for intense feelings of awesome.\u000a\u000aOr that may just be my autistic obsessiveness talking.

VI started trying to find some of the earlier Scandinavian metal bands and came up with a relatively small number compared to what the US/UK metal scenes were producing around the same time. Which is interesting because for all the importance Scandinavia would hold in heavy metal in later years, they were kind of late to the game. I found a couple bands from Sweden and Denmark that formed in the seventies, but didn't release anything until a decade later.\u000a\u000aOn an unrelated note, that album cover is hilarious.
p338
aVHow early is the cutoff?
p339
aV1980 as a year of formation. So basically you have US/UK with hundreds bands and all of Scandinavia with about fifty (50), the overwhelming majority of which are from Sweden. And yes, obviously population size has to be factored in. The thing is that in more recent years, the output from Scandinavia has been disproportionately large, especially from Norway. So basically, Norway sat almost completely dormant for the first decade of the genre, only to explode much later.\u000a\u000aSure, 1980 is an arbitrary number, but it was just a starting point for the investigation. And even though it's arbitrary, it still yields some meaningful results.
p340
aVThere's probably a lot more that are lost to to time and not being accounted for compared to the US and UK, but it makes sense to me - the first Priest album that charted in most of those countries was Killing Machine. Looking at how many bands formed in those places in '81 and '82, it's a different story ... except Norway, where you can directly trace the activity explosion to the black metal scene there.\u000a\u000aSweden's always had a disproportionate amount considering the population since there's a state-run program where kids can get instruments and rehearsal places paid for by the program. 
p341
aVRE: Sweden\u000a\u000aI didn't know that about the government subsidies but it makes sense.\u000a\u000aSweden has always been an interesting study for me, especially regarding Christian metal. Naturally, the US was the birthplace of that scene, but even in Sweden, where Christianity has been all but completely dead for the last century, they still ended up putting out the proto band Jerusalem and then Leviticus later, even beating out UK's own Omega in terms of the date of the first release. It's baffling, really.
p342
aVIf you mean the Omega that put out The Prophet, that was [Apocalypse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LccEcxkNiak) after they changed their name.\u000a\u000aI don't think any of Sweden's early metal bands had any material going in the opposite spiritual direction before Bathory - "Run With the Devil," "Master of Evil," "Stranger From the Dark," "Orphan Devil" (at least as far as I can make out from the vocals) etc. weren't really glorifying things. "Black Writs" *kinda* does, but the next song on that EP was "Born to Rock Hard," so ...
p343
aVYeah, that's the same Omega. Had no idea they had a different original name. So they ended up beating out Sweden by a year it seems.\u000a\u000aWho were some of the first to use Satanic-glorifying stuff in metal? I'm not counting Sabbath because they basically just used his name as a way to be spooky as far as I can tell. I'm talking like Venom, Slayer, Mercyful Fate, Hell, and Bathory.
p344
aVVenom, definitely. Witchfynde and Death SS had the image but not really the lyrics on their recordings before Venom. Acid and Running Wild might have had a song or two each on demos before Venom's first single, but IIRC "Raise the Dead" is on Venom's demo from the year before. Everything else came after Venom, although whether or not Venom was the inspiration for those bands is a different matter. (I don't remember either of the bands whose members formed Mercyful Fate having that kind of lyrics.)\u000a\u000aOtherwise there's bands like Coven (who were terrible) and Black Widow (who weren't), but neither one really matters in the grand scheme of metal until occult rock schtick bands started popping up 5-6 years ago.
p345
aV&gt; occult rock schtick bands\u000a\u000aI'm assuming you're referring to Ghost - are there a bunch of others?
p346
aVYep - them, Jex Thoth, The Devil's Blood, Blood Ceremony, Uncle Acid &amp; The Deadbeats, Occultation, etc.
p347
aVDo they all suck?

aVI don't mind at all if people post less-obscure stuff here - I'd just prefer it not be "The Number of the Beast"/"Breakin' the Law"/"Ace of Spades"/"Master of Puppets"/"Raining Blood" etc. \u000a\u000aThere's cool stuff hidden in even the biggest bands' discographies.
p814
aV&gt; There's cool stuff hidden in even the biggest bands discographies.\u000a\u000aI agree. I try to keep my submissions here to little gems I discover along the way that I'm pretty sure a lot of people haven't heard. I notice that most of your posts are the same way.\u000a\u000aI see this sub as a way to fill in the forty years of heavy metal that I missed from being too late to the show. /r/Metal is fantastic for newer stuff . . . but except for the REC CENTRE thread, it's not terribly good for the classic stuff. In fact, aside from the main threads, I almost think that sub is just *too* busy to be of any use. Fridays are good but there's just a flood. Here I feel like I can learn about a few new bands a day.

So, they changed their name to Child Saint, and wrote a song, using Dave's riffs called... Child Saint.\u000a\u000aAt some point, Dave regretted giving it up, so he re-used the riffs and the song (I believe it was Polaris) ended up on RIP.\u000a\u000aThat's how the story goes, any way.

aVI've been working my way through this list over the last couple hours.\u000a\u000aI don't think that female vocalists are incapable of harsh vocals, but I really don't like the few that I've heard. The heavy metal bands in this group are good, but Chastain freaking takes the cake. I liked Sacrilege and Battlefield musically, but the vocalist for Zed Yago is everything I like about good singing. There's some real depth and substance there.\u000a\u000aI should have mentioned Christian Mistress, but I literally just found out about them within the last twenty-four (24) hours.\u000a\u000aIt's funny because all the gimmicky metal female vocalists seem to get all the attention. I'm saving this thread for later reference as soon as somebody asks me about heavy metal with good female vocalists.

p1299
aVNot sure why I'm bothering to type all this for the two people that will ever read it but:\u000a\u000aHell got signed on Mausoleum records (after countless rejections) for their debut album. The record label went bust before release and this is a direct reason for David Halliday's (guitar &amp; vocals) suicide.\u000a\u000aKev Bower (lead guitar) has a son who is into metal. He was looking over an Arch Enemy CD that his son had bought and noticed the name of the producer: Andy Sneap, who David Halliday had tought guitar and was a regular at Hell shows in the 80s. Kev got in touch with Andy and met. This is when reforming the band to record the album was mooted. Kev hadn't played guitar since and could only remember how to play 'The Oppressors'. \u000a\u000a'Human Remains' was recorded originally with Martin Walkyier (Sabbat/Skyclad) on vocals however the result sounded much like an unrealeased Sabbat album so Kev asked his brother David Beckford (surname changed for acting reasons) who was in the studio to do some voiceover work to try his hand at singing one of the songs. This obviously went well because the band continued with David Beckford on lead vocals. Martin Walkyier incidentally hasn't spoken to Andy Sneap since he was let go from Hell. Make of that what you will.\u000a\u000aHell owe much of their current success to Andy Sneap working for free as well as having the right industry connections. Kev Bower's carpentry skill allowing them to have a high quality stage production at a budget and David Beckford's acting pedigree for his command over the audience in the live setting. \u000a\u000aIncidentally the song posted is one of only a couple of songs from the demo period that haven't been re-recorded or incorporated into a new song as of yet.
p1300
aVMore than two will read your think. Hell may be years down the road for me  but I dig the logo and such comments that raise awarenes. Thoughts also intersect unseen. Like dreams. Like weaving an ensign to ourselves, in my opinion.
p1301
aV&gt; Not sure why I'm bothering to type all this for the two people that will ever read it\u000a\u000aHey now. I am immensely appreciative of whatever I can glean from the readers and contributors of this subreddit. I think it sucks that so few people participate here, but there seems to be a general rule that little more than a small percentage of subscribers will ever do anything on the smaller subreddits.\u000a\u000aThat said, I didn't know anything about the history if Hell. I just know that I recently picked up a couple albums and was shocked when they showed up in the Metal Archives as having formed in 1982. So, thank you for typing all that out. /u/deathofthesun may already know that, but I didn't.
p1302
aVThanks a lot! I had to do at least a brief overview of how the band got back together because they're one of my favourite bands. I've seen them 8 times since their first return gig. (Which included full pyros in a tiny dive club and cost the princely sum of £5)\u000a\u000aI'm not sure all of the information is public domain as I can't remember what I've read online and what I've got from talking to the band themselves. I find official histories to be very dry and I love talking to bands about the more human elements of what makes a band work.\u000a\u000aI'm glad someone still appreciates indepth stuff on Reddit, I'd rather given up on it as the upvote system puts short 'witty' comments and videos of songs that people upvote without listening to because they already like the band to the top. Which is the opposite of a conducive environment for in-depth discussion.\u000a\u000a
p1303
aVI think the only thing that might not be out there is the extent of how pissed Walkyier was/is.\u000a\u000aTo be honest I'd welcome more text-only/discussion threads here. By now it's populous enough that there could be some decent discussion.
p1304
aV&gt; there could be some decent discussion\u000a\u000aYeah, there *could* be, but it's like pulling teeth to get readers to contribute. I'm not interested in karma at all, but it is very frustrating to see over a thousand subscribers here, and basically only a single contributor doing the overwhelming majority of the posting and the only one answering questions. It's the same way on a small subreddit that I moderate as well.\u000a\u000aThen on the larger subreddits, you have endless post after post of garbage and people only upvoting the popular bands. Face it, it takes effort to contribute to an online community and very few people are interested in doing so. I'd post here more often, but I just don't have that much of a knowledge base to justify doing so. If I find a good track to post, there is a pretty good chance that the band has been posted already.
p1305
aVThe general rule of thumb is 10% of the subscribers are active and 10% of that amount participate. So 1,200/120/12 sounds about right for a sub this sized. Three years ago it had barely hit 200 subscribers. There were never many self-posts in the past, so it wasn't too surprising that didn't change over time. \u000a\u000aIf a band hasn't been submitted in the last six months, go for it. 
p1306
aVThere's a collage of the rejection letters they got in the 2CD and 3LP versions of Human Remains.\u000a\u000aThe only thing that bums me out about the reunion is the comprehensive demo anthology that was in the works never materialized, although the Human Remains demo bonus was a nice consolation prize.

But by *Nightfall*, the chance to *Run for the Light* is gone and the *Symphony of Shadows* has overtaken us. During the summer months (around the time of the feast of *Saint Vitus*), this is more manageable, but *After the Fall*, we run into *Trouble* with *The Darkening* days. After to-day's reading from *Psalm IX*, the *Reverend (Bizarre* as it may seem) warned us of not seeking *Salvation's Answer* and used the *Tales of Creation* to highlight the resurrection, where all will be *Exhumed of the Earth*.
p1396

The only Swedish bands we truly respected in those days were Heavy Load because they were the first Swedish Metal band, Neon Rose because they were the first good Heavy Rock band coming out of Sweden, and Yngwie Malmsteen because he played the shit out of anyone and everything back then.\u201d\u000a\u000aIIRC part of why Messiah had to talk Leif into letting him audition for Candlemass was because Leif wasn't big on Mercy.
p1398
aVI not sure that contradicts the point about them nearly arriving at this independently of each other.\u000a\u000aAlso,\u000a\u000a&gt;IIRC part of why Messiah had to *harass the shit out of* Leif into letting him audition for Candlemass was because Leif wasn't big on Mercy.\u000a\u000aWhen I heard the bonus commentary on Epicus I was amazed they let him in, but I guess it worked out.
p1399
aVIt was more the "didn't know each other" part, although even once Mercy started playing doom I don't think they were super-close to Nemesis and definitely not to Candlemass.
p1400
aVYeah, they were aware of each other's bands, but they lived in different cities and didn't really associate before Candlemass. I'm agreeing that they knew *of* each other, but there was no pooling of ideas or anything.

aVThat's not actually a thing, though - just like Venezuelan or Canadian or wherever else metal. \u000a\u000aIt only comes into play for NWOBHM (which was a movement and not a genre) and USPM, since the power metal term got co-opted later for something totally different from what it used to mean. 
p1480
aVWell, it depends on what you mean by "thing". In a grander sense, no. But when you're discussing HM of the 80s specifically, it's most certainly a term that's often used. In that small niche, I'd consider it to be much more relevant than "Canadian Metal" or "Venezuelan Metal" which are much more general.\u000a\u000aSaying that modern Swedish Heavy Metal bands' genre is "Swedish Heavy Metal" isn't very wise though, unless they're a '80s revival band' (of which there are several).
p1481
aVIn terms of referring to where they're from, sure, but it doesn't give any indication to what a band actually sounds like. Gotham City, Heavy Load, Torch, Overdrive, Axe Witch. Glory Bells Band, early 220 Volt and Europe, etc. didn't play Swedish Metal. They played heavy metal. (Well you could say epic metal for Heavy Load, but I think you know what I mean.) Oz moved from Finland to Sweden and what they were playing fit right in.

VIt's a classification based on geography and time, nothing more. \u000a\u000aAnyone who considers it a genre can be disregarded, same for anyone who thinks Judas Priest were a part of it.

p1521
aV&gt; It's a classification based on geography and time, nothing more. \u000a\u000aAh, OK I guess I always wondered why we tag bands as "NWOBHM" unless it's implied that all said bands just played traditional (heavy) metal and just happened to be in the UK between a certain number of years.\u000a\u000aThat's a massive variety in the first list. And that AtomKraft track just blows me away. I can't imagine how that sound came out so many years ago.\u000a\u000aAs for the second list, that's where my bafflement came in since bands all around the globe were building on the same sound.
p1522
aVThat Atomkraft album is from '85 - their earlier demos sound a bit different.\u000a\u000aA lot of the bands would fall under the traditional banner, but not such an overwhelming majority that you can make a blanket statement about the whole movement like a lot of people tend to.

VCould this also be considered power metal? How does the term *melodic metal* relate to power metal and heavy metal?
p1661
aVIf you mean melodic metal as in /r/melodicmetal, it's just a catch-all term for non-black/death/grind/thrash. Basically just clean vocals.\u000a\u000aBefore the term power metal got co-opted by Keepers of the Seven Keys/Bland Guardian type stuff, it originally meant bands that were more powerful than the norm, maybe even faster. It was also before speed and thrash had become solidified descriptors, so sometimes Kill 'Em All, the Metal Church debut, Fistful of Metal, etc. get lumped in as power/speed. Burning Star, Battle Cry, Ample Destruction ... that's power metal.\u000a\u000aSome NWOBHM bands would fall into that category (since NWOBHM isn't a genre), others are just heavy metal.\u000a\u000aFor Syron Vanes, they're just plain ol' heavy metal.

The first two are their best. \u000a\u000aOther than them, limiting it to heavy/speed/power and including a few announced for next year:\u000a\u000a* Rage - 21 albums (plus one under the name Avenger)\u000a* Earthshaker (JPN) - 20 albums\u000a* Ossian - 19 albums\u000a* Manilla Road - 17 albums\u000a* Running Wild, Grave Digger, Anthem (JPN) - 16 albums (plus one for Grave Digger under the name Digger)\u000a* Anvil, Killers (FRA) - 15 albums\u000a* Riot, Turbo, Pretty Maids, Aria - 14 albums\u000a* Pokolgep, Virgin Steele, Baron Rojo - 13 albums\u000a* Raven, Girlschool - 12 albums\u000a* Saint - 11 albums\u000a* Stormwitch, Tygers of Pan Tang, Satan's Host, Tokyo Blade - 10 albums\u000a* Helstar, Chastain, Kat, ADX, Jag Panzer, Picture, Obús, Rata Blanca, Nightmare (FRA), Master (RUS) - 9 albums\u000a\u000aProbably forgetting a few. Some are successful in their homeland and relatively unknown outside of it. Some were/are more consistent than others - YMMV.
p1922
aVI know/have about maybe one fourth of those bands, tops. This is exactly what I was looking for.\u000a\u000aI'm not going to ask about which albums to get from all of those - I'll do the discovery on my own. This is already above and beyond the call of duty here.\u000a\u000a&gt; Pokolgép\u000a\u000aI love how you know so many Magyar bands. I got into the Magyar metal scene because of a friend of mine from Transylvania who is half Hungarian, half Romanian. I mean, music is music, but it's still pretty cool when otherwise unknown band names pop up and you're like, "Hey, I know that band!" This doesn't happen to me very often, and certainly not with Hungarian bands.\u000a\u000a&gt; Obús\u000a\u000aYes! This band looks awesome. They sing in Spanish too. This is perfect.
p1923
aV&gt; That s/t VR album is the pretty much the last one in their discography you need\u000a\u000aDammit, I hate it when you're right.\u000a\u000aExplanation. I was so impressed by the first releases of Vicious Rumors that I went ahead and got most of their albums. After the self-titled, they just dropped off completely. I mean, the guitarwork was still top notch, but everything but the guitar was just awful, almost had a nu-metal feel to it.\u000a\u000aI take your recommendations seriously, but I also know that in many cases you can be less forgiving than I would be (case in point: Megadeth after *Youthanasia*) so I really had no idea of the serious drop in quality that would come on their later works.
p1924
aVYeah, they definitely tried to hitch a ride on the Pantera train for a few albums. \u000a\u000aSupposedly the last three are good again - I was going to catch them live but they canceled the tour, so I can't say for sure if they've changed back into something worthy or not since I was going to use the show to gauge whether those albums would be worth the plunge.
p1925
aVI have heard that they are still doing shows. In fact, some guy posted on /r/Metal that his music teacher plays bass for them currently. Crazy.\u000a\u000aAlso, Liege Lord is playing in Brooklyn this March. I know that's quite a haul for both of us, but I am seriously considering if I can make that work.
p1926
aVThe odds of me making it out for that NY show with Brocas Helm/Exciter/High Spirits/etc. was a lot better before the Nifelheim/Ares Kingdom show got added Sunday night. \u000a\u000aBecause of that additional show I'd need Monday off to fly back I don't know if I could get the time off work for both that and MDF.

p2065
aVIncubus is a given. Messiah Force is a fantastic speed metal band, but I hadn't seen them posted before. You have to remember that I've only been subscribed to /r/ClassicMetal for less than a year.\u000a\u000aBut for USPM, it's hard to beat [Apostle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GDndUj6ZSE). The *White Metal* EP and the *Metal for the Master* LP are unskippable.\u000a\u000aAlso, [Messiah Prophet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6lPQVUnAww), [Bloodgood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt4Z5PxgoYA), and [Leviticus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB88b11d_6w) are pretty important too.\u000a\u000aTry to ignore the absurdity of my making recommendations for you.
p2066
aVI was just limiting it to bands that had been submitted here - and I thought Bride had been but apparently not. \u000a\u000aApostle and Leviticus are great. Bloodgood aren't a favorite but they're not bad either. Messiah Prophet ... not really a fan.
p2067
aVWhat do you think of the thrash/death bands like [Mortification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu4KTS3iNGc), [Crimson Thorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib-1Pt5Dbts), [Vengeance Rising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-Jux-1trTw) and [Deliverance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxis5KjxI1A)?
p2068
aVI like Vengeance Rising's Human Sacrifice and a couple Believer albums. The first two Mortification albums aren't a favorite but I don't think they suck, either. \u000a\u000aIf you want to lump Deadly Blessing into the thrash category on a technicality, they'd be my non-Incubus favorite.
p2069
aVWow, I actually don't know Deadly Blessing. Holy crap.\u000a\u000aMy non-Incubus favourite would be Seventh Angel, but their latest effort completely left their thrash roots behind. They are listed on the archives as thrash/doom, which seems weird until you hear their music.

p2102
(lp2103
VFrom my limited understanding, the release history for this band is cloudy, due to re-releases, re-records, and copyright issues.
p2104
aVAll you really need are:\u000a\u000a* The Story of Death SS 1977-1984 (the original version, not the Svart reissue) - has the first EP, plus some early demos and live stuff\u000a* The Horned God of the Witches - most of the early demos, plus some alternate early recordings\u000a\u000a... and then the first three albums, which aren't on par with the Paul Chain-era stuff though still good in their own right - mostly the first, In Death of Steve Sylvester. The next two have diminishing returns, especially Heavy Demons. The live album The Cursed Concert is decent but not mandatory by any stretch. \u000a\u000aA lot of the early songs got re-recorded on the first three albums. \u000a\u000aEverything after that is best ignored.
p2105
aVI picked up the Svart reiss of In Death of Steve Sylvester.\u000a\u000a&gt;(the original version, not the Svart reissue)\u000a\u000aWhy's that?
p2106
aVThey replaced a few songs from the original with newer, inferior versions and dropped a couple of songs altogether.\u000a\u000aI don't think they messed with the In Death ... reissue, just The Story Of.

p2258
aVGiven the timeframe and place of origin I'd bet a few bucks that was one of the main inspirations.\u000a\u000a[One other song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d_B2ceqpMA) popped up on a Stormbringer comp a decade ago (and far outshone almost all the other featured bands) ... was hoping they or another label would release a full demo collection but it's sadly never materialized.

VNot to be confused with Adramelch, who has been very popular in reddit lately somehow.\u000a\u000aHere is a little lesson for those interested, \u000a\u000a&gt;Adramelech, also called Adrammelech, Adramelek or Adar-malik, (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05b7\u05d3\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05de\u05b6\u05bc\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0, Modern Adrammelekh Tiberian \u02bcA\u1e0framméle\u1e35; Greek: \u0391\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c7 Adramelekh; Latin: Adramelech) was a form of sun god related to Moloch. The centre of his worship was the town of Sepharvaim. According to (II Kings 17:31) the cult was brought by the Sepharvite colonists into Samaria: "the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim". - like Moloch. The melech element means "King" in Hebrew.\u000a\u000ahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adramelech
