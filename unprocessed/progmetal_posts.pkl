Those who make the argument that this inhibits discussion are without grounds--this thread will contain comments for every individual song on the album(s) so that there can be threaded discussion for them if people desire that. Also, general self-posts regarding the album will remain admissible, though we recommend people use this thread if at all possible.

sVAdvice for my first prog show
p13
VHello, thank you for reading this. Here is my dilemma. Both Haken and Chon are playing at the same venue on the same night only 30 minutes apart.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=5695115&amp;pl=webhall&amp;REFID=whsite\u000a\u000ahttp://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=5629145&amp;pl=webhall&amp;REFID=whsite\u000a\u000aIf you were in my shoes who would you see? I really like both bands and have been stuck on this for a while. I thought about Haken first because it is their first American tour and 3rd show in the US. Kind of special right?\u000a\u000aBut I also really enjoy Chon and would love to see them live. \u000a\u000aAgain, who would you choose? Thank you for reading this!

sVDifference between the terms "experimental" and "progressive"?
p15
VI've heard these terms many times, sometimes interchangeably, and they seem to refer largely to a certain genre of music. However, I'm still somewhat unsure how to define each term or how to describe them to people who are unfamiliar with them. Also is there a difference between the two? Thanks!

I've listened to this song dozens of time and never picked up on it! I think it's Petrucci's guitar, he probably hit a fret, but I wonder why they didn't do another take (he would have noticed it)? Any theories?

p89
Vthe show in ft lauderdale was great. very solid performance by everyone. including Nothing More and Wovenwar(they were fantastic). But I was a really disappointed by the fact that Thank You Scientist weren't able to make the show, and also the fact that Spencer developed strep throat. (I know these things happen and I'm not blaming them for it). it lead to playing only so many songs and some had to be played instrumental. I guess what I'm trying to say is that all in all my friend and I didn't feel we got our monies worth.

p122
VNot sure this has been discussed before, so feel free to link me if it has.\u000a\u000aFirst, I'm excluding instrumental music from this category because lyrics and vocals are a huge part of what I'm referencing.\u000a\u000aIn my music library I have made a distinct separation of what I consider two very different styles of "prog" rock/metal. I literally label bands as "prog rock/metal" or "progressive rock/metal".\u000a\u000aTo me **prog** seems to include or even require most or all of the following elements:\u000a\u000a* Keyboards\u000a* Concept albums\u000a* Cheesy/nerdy themes (i.e. Sci-Fi stuff)\u000a* Odd time signatures (sometimes so much so that it's difficult to keep the music fluid)\u000a* Non-melodic/dissonant scales\u000a* Value technicality over emotionality\u000a* High-pitched or off-key vocals\u000a\u000aThen **progressive** to me seems to be a lot less formulaic but often incorporates the following:\u000a\u000a* Additional instrumentation (i.e. more than just guitar/bass/drums but doesn't often get stuck on one instrument)\u000a* Odd time signatures\u000a* Sticks with melodic scales or balances well melodic+dissonant scales\u000a* Balance of emotion and technicality\u000a* Various genres (quite often I consider just combining my "progressive" rock/metal library into one since they are often a mix of both and many other genres (i.e. jazz, blues, classical, etc.)\u000a\u000aI tend to prefer "progressive" over "prog" 80-90% of the time. I prefer emotion most of all in my music. It's the number one most important characteristic. I value technical ability very highly, but not for the sake of just being technical. Too much focus on dissonant/non-melodic scales for the sake of being different often grates my ears and eventually turns me off. Cheesy keyboard effects and Sci-Fi themes disconnects me from the music and leaves me detached.\u000a\u000aExamples of **prog** bands that are just too \u201cprog\u201d (i.e. follows the formula outlined above too strictly) for me. Now this doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t respect them or listen to them (I often come back and listen to a new album or try them again). But for some reason just the keyboards or vocals are often what push me away, even if the guitars or drums are amazing:\u000a\u000a* Rush\u000a* Dream Theater (though I do love Scenes from a Memory, \u201cPull Me Under\u201d being one of my fav songs by them)\u000a* Genesis\u000a* Yes\u000a* Marillion\u000a* Spock\u2019s Beard\u000a* Savatage\u000a* Symphony X\u000a* Redemption\u000a* Vanden Plas\u000a\u000aExamples of **prog** bands that do something right (or include something that I don\u2019t like but am able to filter out or get past):\u000a\u000a* Evergrey\u000a* Disperse\u000a* Haken\u000a* Votum\u000a* Mystery\u000a* Riverside\u000a* Division by Zero\u000a\u000aExamples of **progressive** bands I love and why (there\u2019s so many so I sadly have to limit this by trying to pick my favorite of each unique characteristic):\u000a\u000a* Tool: everything (seriously: song structure, lyrics, vocal style, instrumentation, production, mixing, etc were so unique at that time and still are)\u000a* Opeth: soft/hard dynamics (i.e. vocals &amp; guitars)\u000a* Mastodon: ~~scales~~ melodic dissonance? (these guys are hard to describe for me)\u000a* Wretched: overall instrumentation\u000a* Devin Townsend: production &amp; genres\u000a* Katatonia: mood/emotion\u000a* Between the Buried and Me: genres\u000a* Periphery: nothing super unique but a large blend of slightly unique characteristics\u000a* Tesseract/Skyharbor: vocals &amp; atmosphere\u000a* Karnivool: lyrics &amp; tunings\u000a* Gazpacho: instrumentation &amp; mood\u000a* The Dear Hunter: genres &amp; themes\u000a* The Tea Party: world instruments\u000a\u000aAnyway, I just felt like putting this together. I don\u2019t care if anyone reads it, but sometimes I like to organise my thoughts and see what others\u2019 opinions are if they feel like reading my thoughts and responding. Now that you know my tastes feel free to recommend new bands for me or try to introduce me to someone that breaks the boundaries of what I claim I don\u2019t like.\u000a\u000a**TL:DR** I split progressive music into two categories: prog and progressive. Prog tends to set a formula and stick with it (i.e. time signatures, themes, keyboards, vocals, etc.) while progressive I consider literally progressive (i.e. artists that literally do something different or unique: general death metal but throw in acoustic guitars, general rock but through in eastern instruments, etc.). I like \u201cprogressive\u201d a lot more. What bands do you like/dislike, and what categories do they fall into? What would you recommend to me that you think I would like?

p131
V I've been listening to a good deal of Dream Theater tonight for no apparent reason. I'm not a dedicated fan to their work but I do of course appreciate it all and thoroughly enjoy listening to it.  \u000a  \u000a We all know Labrie gets a bad rap sometimes but I want to talk about how amazing he sounds in songs such as Octavarium and Forsaken. There are plenty more but they stick out in my mind. I have to say he's one of a few singers that evoke a totally different feeling in me. There's something grandiose and epic about his voice that really draws me in.  \u000a  \u000a I just wanted to show some love for this extraordinarily talented man that I'm not even a huge fan of.

sVGood Guitar Effects Pedals for Prog?
p133
VHey, first of all- I'm not sure if this question is allowed here. If it isn't, I'm sorry, and I'll delete it. The reason I ask here instead of /r/guitar is that I think I'm more likely to reach my 'target audience' here.\u000a\u000aBut I wanted to get this community's opinion on what are some good electric guitar pedals for prog metal playing (and additionally what amps/setups you use?). \u000a\u000aI'm looking for a suboctaver, a customizable delay, that sort of thing. Not against multipedals, but they tend to be (in my experience), quantity over quality.\u000a\u000aAlso, really interested in getting another wah. Best wah I ever had was a Zoom, nice gain, good range, etc.\u000a\u000aAny suggestions?\u000a\u000aEdit: Forgot to mention that I have a Jackson Pro Soloist (SL2).

sVThere's more Animals As Leaders, and you haven't heard it.
p148
VIf you're as much of an AAL addict as me, there being more Animals As Leaders music somewhere out there totally new to you is a pretty exciting concept, and it might well be the case. There's an ever growing collection of music by Tosin Abasi, Javier Reyes, Matt Gartska and Navene Koperweis lurking on the internets. If you missed out on one or more of these, hopefully you'll find something new you love. If I've missed anything, let me know. \u000a\u000a* [REFLUX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e73z1gy1Ks) (Abasi) - Not my sort of thing but this is Tosin in the early days; interesting to see his roots. \u000a\u000a* WAVE OF BABIES (AAL) - This is fairly well known, but a great AAL track released before Weightless that doesn't feature on any album. [Check out the live performance at EMGtv.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt-RoSzsEKA) \u000a\u000a* [OPTIMIST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4gTgM0UepQ) &amp; [PESSIMIST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UItUYIwkFcc) (Abasi) - Two standalone tracks released by Abasi and Misha Mansoor around Joy of Motion time and with some similar vibes to both that record and Periphery. \u000a\u000a* [MESTIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lBOgvLam90&amp;list=PLH22-xSMERQrgi1kWmox2vvoJ2o-z0scd) (Reyes) - A solo project by Javier under the alias Mestis, with one album out (and possibly the only one that will ever be released?) called Basal Ganglia. Clocking in around the 20 minute mark, it's short and sweet. Really sweet  in fact, this is one of my favourite albums with heavy AAL influence and some of Javier's unique Latin jazz flavour that crept into the Joy of Motion album in tracks like Para Mexer. [Check out the live performance of Tomato- sorry, Te Mato at EMGtv.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Ps3q_DbUw) \u000a\u000a* [TRAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBX8an0PY5c&amp;list=PLC82B49CF43E5229D) (Abasi+Reyes) - Basically a prog supergroup that wrote a jazz album called Lingua Franca and it's fucking awesome. Again, definite moments in here that have a very AAL feel to them. \u000a\u000a* [NAVENE-K](http://navenek.bandcamp.com/music) (Koperweis) - Solo project undertaken by Koperweis when he parted ways with AAL after production of Weightless. This stuff is quite different to AAL with electronic and percussion driven music with a minimalist angle. Some sick drops, beast mode drumming and the keen ear can pick out some lingering AAL influence in the melodies. \u000a\u000a* [ENTHEOS](http://www.metalsucks.net/2015/01/05/entheos-former-members-faceless-animals-leaders-launch-new-project/) (Koperweis) - Bookmark it, favourite it, write it down, set it add your damn desktop background, whatever. Navene has formed a new band that have a first EP to release in the near future, and you don't want to forget about it. They've finished making it from what I can gather and the promo clip glaring around somewhere out in the ether sounds dope. Be ready for this shit.\u000a\u000a* [FLESHWROUGHT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZGljDQmavE) (Koperweis) - A band in a very different area of metal to AAL but featuring Navene's monstrous drumming.\u000a\u000a* [ANIMOSITY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvMplYSUCWY) - Another pre-AAL band featuring Koperweis. Deathcore fans rejoice.\u000a\u000a* [TWO MAN TRIO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuEHZ6pNx4c) (Gartska) - Some crazy musicianship going on here. Matt's outstanding rhythms and a dude playing bass and keyboard simultaneously, hence Two Man Trio. \u000a\u000a* [HYPHENS](https://clyp.it/j12wobas) (AAL) - A demo for Weightless. Probably the earliest collaborative work for AAL out there, the first album being written by Abasi alone. You can spot moments in here that would later be used in the track Weightless, a very cool listen. While we're at it, [a demo of The Price Of Everything And The Value Of Nothing can be heard here.](https://clyp.it/dwkt1cyo)\u000a\u000a* AAL EXTRAS - There's a [vocal cover of Behaving Badly by Kelela Mizanekrostos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baEuKEDw72E), and it's really cool. The original is nice to watch, but there's also a [remastered version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suDb9R3Pv7w) by an AAL fan that improves the sound significantly. There's also a [Behaving Badly &amp; The Price Of Everything And The Value Of Nothing medley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnlXhTksH-w) they play live and there's a drum cam of it on YouTube. \u000a\u000aThese are all easy to find on Google, hopefully I've introduced you to something new here. Here's to hoping for a fourth AAL album! \u000a\u000a

sV[Discussion] Periphery canceling their appearance in Philly tonight. The rest of the show goes on as planned.
p253
VFrom their facebook page:\u000a\u000a&gt; To our dear friends in Philadelphia,\u000a&gt; We are extremely upset to inform you that we are not able to make it to your fine city to perform for you today.\u000a&gt; There are two members of Periphery who are currently battling illnesses/ailments that sadly require full on bed rest. Doctors have been seen and they have strongly advised us to take the immediate, necessary time off from performing, to stop the symptoms from getting much worse on both accounts.\u000a&gt; We are working with our team and the promoters to find a new time/date to come and perform for you all, but today we will absolutely miss you.\u000a&gt; On a positive note, Nothing More, Wovenwar, and Thank You Scientist are doing just fine, and will still be coming to Philadelphia today to absolutely destroy for you.\u000a&gt; We will continue to update you as information comes in, and we genuinely thank you for your understanding and empathy in this shot situation.\u000a&gt; Please still enjoy the show today, and we'll do our best to get back to you as soon as we can.\u000a&gt; Thank you,\u000a&gt; Periphery\u000a\u000aTampa saw a truncated performance from these guys a few weeks ago, with Spencer stating he had strep throat. A song was played instrumentally, for that purpose.\u000a\u000a\u000aI am curious as to the plan to remedy this for those who paid to see Periphery. I was only interested in TYS and Periphery when I went. TYS played for about 20 minutes, followed by the shit sandwich that is that radio metal that filled the time between TYS and Periphery. I would not be happy about going to a show like this and would expect a full refund.\u000a\u000aEdit: This actually may be the last day of their tour. Seems so shady, despite them being sick. I feel so bad for anyone who wanted to see them and now are stuck w/o the money for their tickets and no show worth seeing.\u000a\u000aEdit 2: Looks like full refunds being offered at "point of sale". So, I guess you either see the venue or whatever ticket broker you used.\u000a

I can also present the fruits of your commenting labour, the playlist so far ladies and gents: http://grooveshark.com/#!/playlist/Awesome+Proggy+Metal/104500900\u000aOf course still a work in progress, but quadrupled in size since your excellent contributions \u000aAlso a quick apology if my answers are terrible and nonsensical in places, I respond/type at the end of my working day, which is a very long day aha.\u000aPeace and love!

sVIs the sidebar an actual picture of Plini?
p257
VI've been following Plini since the Halcyon full-length, and he's been pretty notoriously camera-shy. Is the sidebar picture regarding his AMA an actual picture of him? If so, what is the context? Did he put it out quietly? It's literally the only picture I've ever seen of him.

sVCan any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?
p259
VI am typically a technical deathmetal fan with a little blues rock sprinkled here and there.\u000a\u000aBut for years and years I have always loved a couple of bands that were outside of my typical range and I never explored the genre further until now.\u000a\u000aI have adored Coheed and Cambria and Protest the hero for years. Recently I started looking for more bands like them and have found the following which I really enjoy:\u000a\u000a* Corelia\u000a\u000a* Periphery\u000a\u000a* The Mars Volta\u000a\u000a* Antemasque\u000a\u000a* Closure in Moscow\u000a\u000aCan anyone suggest more bands based on these that I might like? I typically like high pitched singing mixed with growls if thats any help.\u000a\u000aThanks in advance

sVKnow any bands with an eastern, exotic, or tribal feel to them?
p329
VI'm really into atmospheric bands that envelope you in their sound, specifically ones that have an arabesque feel to them, such as Myrath and Jericco.  In addition, I've always loved music with traditional elements to them (Eluveitie is one of my favorite bands of all time), but I've had a hard time finding a progressive group that encorporates such elements into their music on an extensive scale.  Portions of Unitopia and United Progressive Front's tracks offer such a feel with the tribal drums, exotic flutes, and tambourines, but there has to be more out there somewhere!\u000a\u000aFor further reference, I'm way more into clean vocals when it comes to progressive music...in fact, instrumentals are fine, too.

VGot the twin albums in the mail today and I have to say I am so *blown away* with what they have created. It is really heavy without sounding like they are trying to be the blackest most brutal band out there and that's an achievement as far as I'm concerned. What I love is the way the music (especially the vocals) really manage to convey the intense emotions the character in the story is experiencing, very moving. The artwork is fantastic also. I need to hear it some more but the real stand outs are:\u000a\u000a* The Bad Thing (SO POWERFUL, both emotionally and musically, I lose my mind every time I hear the transition from the end of the first chorus into the 2nd verse. *chills*)\u000a* Alpha\u000a* 22 Faces\u000a* Heavy Heart\u000a\u000aBeing one who really digs concept albums in general, I have been reading the lyrics and listening to the songs and I have a rough (and brief) estimation of what I think is happening in the story, though I may be way off, it will be interesting to hear what they say when they eventually talk about it.\u000a\u000a* **ALPHA**: So I think it starts during a satanic cult birthing ritual in an old cathedral in the forest (judging from the artwork) where the mother is bathed in the blood of the circle while the child is being born, and the onlookers pore their hatred and negativity into the child in order to create a demon. The child grows in the cathedral where it was born, in total isolation, the only people he comes into contact with are the cult, and as he grows, the hatred builds inside of him until it overwhelms him and the darkness takes over.\u000a\u000a* **OMEGA**: At this point he becomes the embodiment of all the evil and filth that had been poured into him from inception, strikes out and slaughters everyone. There is a brief mention of a girl locked in the same place, growing up, who may have been his only companion, however briefly, and fears what they have turned him into (what is underneath the stone), and manages to escape and run away. He starts to realise his own demonic destiny, believing that what soul he may have had has been destroyed and this leads him on a Journey down into the earth ("there's a crack in the earth") where he is being called by Beelzebub. Once he arrives he has an internal struggle, believing that he is sin, destruction and unholy filth, yet he yearns for forgiveness and begins to repent. This begins to heal his soul and he is drawn up into the light above, to his surprise.\u000a\u000aI'm keen to hear what everyone else thinks.\u000a\u000aEither way, killer albums. Fucking stoked.

sVWhat are your favorite "epic" progressive rock/metal tracks.
p499
VSo, I've been listening to ["Milliontown" by Frost*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJThffrpY1Q) and ["Learned"](https://arcaneaustralia.bandcamp.com/track/learned) by Arcane lately. Both of them are very lengthy, ambitious, and fleshed-out tracks spanning 20+ minutes. It got me thinking: what are you favorite "epic songs?" To lay a set of ground rules, I'd define an "epic song" as:\u000a\u000a* Having a length of over 15-17 minutes\u000a* Being a continuous piece of music over its entire track length\u000a* It could be divided into separate parts, but it doesn't necessarily need to be.\u000a\u000aNow, I'm sure I'm going to see "Octavarium," "The Odyssey," and "The Great Escape" posted a lot, but I'm going to go against the grain and choose a Haken song...and not the one most people would think. To date, no lengthy track has enraptured me and made me feel like pausing it would be a disservice to the song like ["Crystallised"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk9Wk96yzBY) has. Every part of it seems deliberate and nothing feels out of place. Not taking anything away from "Celestial Elixir" and "Visions," which also fall into the "epic" category, I just gravitate more towards "Crystallised."

p514
Vhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_hhXZ48gc&amp;feature=youtu.be\u000a\u000aThis song is part of THE HUMAN TRANSCRIPTION. Several speeches, each in different languages, were converted into musical pieces by extracting the notes from their regular spoken voices. For fans of James Franco and Seth Rogans "The Interview".\u000a\u000a\u000aIn this instance, Korean is the language transcribed. It is important to note that the many different speakers in this composition all sound enthusiastic, and often speak from hi pitch to low pitch, or vice versa. Korean is very tonal and rhythmic, which made this transcription an enjoyable challenge. No modifications, alterations, or editing was done to the voice.\u000a\u000aThere are no political points of view or any other aspects associated with this project other than the extraction of melodies from the language and mood; in other words, to see how language and music naturally reflect.\u000a\u000a\u000aGuitars - Felix Martin\u000aBass- Kilian Duarte\u000aDrums- Phil Galatioto

sVMy interpretation of Periphery's Juggernaut Alpha/Omega story
p535
VSorry in advance for the wall of text, but I spent a lot of time listening and thinking about the new Juggernaut albums from Periphery and below is in my opinion the story the album tells.  I hope you all like it and am inviting feedback on parts you may think I\u2019m dead wrong about or may be on the right track about.   I obviously can\u2019t know if any of what I\u2019ve come up with is right or not.  \u000a\u000aTLDR: The overarching story of the albums tells a story of a man who is born into a cult, involved in some kind of experimentation or even perhaps satanic rituals.  He is having second thoughts about everything he\u2019s been involved in and tries to come to terms with it and grow past it, but in the end can\u2019t do it.  In an attempt to free himself from the guilt and redeem himself, he kills those that he was controlled by.  Not finding relief, and possibly captured, he  loses his faith. After taking his own life, he serves his sentence in hell and is reborn.  There are many references to political conspiracy events in the real world which leads me to believe that the album draws a lot of influence from the stories and events of real people who may have been involved in such events.  \u000a\u000aI\u2019ll try to explain the story line song by song below.\u000a\u000a\u000a* 1.	A Black Minute \u2013 The title itself seems to be a reference to multiple books by the same name, that all tell the story of murders that start small and as more information is revealed, more -crimes become involved and evidence uncovered.  More and more political figures, police and others get involved before ultimately a massive cover up takes place by those with the power and those who are guilty.   This sets the background of our narrator, a child who is born into some kind of religious cult.  The lyrics paint a picture of what seems to be a ritual taking place, with the word \u201csacrifice\u201d being used.\u000a* 2.	MK Ultra \u2013 [Literally the code name of a CIA operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra)  involving mind control that went horribly wrong, involved unknown deaths and injuries of children and adults as well.  MK Ultra is unquestionably told as the \u201csacrifice\u201d, or ritual, is taking place, with a much harsher tone and tells the story of the abuse they give to the children.  Direct quotes such as \u201cInnocent babe, shall we corrupt at such a young age\u201d and \u201ctake this bruise as a sign that we own you now and forevermore\u201d are fairly clear in my mind.  The elevator type music that comes toward the end of the song, signifies that the experience is all but routine for the members of the evil group, part of their life as normal as anything else, and also that the ritual is done.\u000a* 3.	Heavy Heart \u2013 This song is a reflection by the narrator on what his life has become.  He feels bad but is trying to just let it go, \u201cWhat's left with me is a memory, when the flesh moves on\u201d showing that his mind is having trouble getting past it.  Wishing he could just go away and disappear from it all, \u201csometimes I wish I had wings, fly far away from this life\u201d.  His horrible actions consume his everyday life, \u201cthese thoughts go on all day, and it takes hold of me\u201d.  He finally finds rest (sleep), ashamed of what he\u2019s a part of and whats happened to him, it even haunts him even in sleep.  \u201cResting now, their bodies hit the ground, nightmares creep over me I hear the sounds\u201d.  \u000a* 4.	The Event \u2013 I believe this song is the narrator dreaming, re-experiencing the atrocities he has been forced to be a part of.   \u000a* 5.	The Scourge \u2013 The narrator awakes from the nightmare \u201ceyes heavy, omens clear\u201d.  He is distraught and wanting to give up, \u201cThis man, he fell apart,\u201d  but as you\u2019ll notice halfway through the song it begins to get a little more cheery as he decides that he needs to get it together as \u201cI will survive.\u201d  He also seems to point anger at those he has been involved with and may have coerced/forced him to be a part of things he regrets, \u201cthe blood that it spills shall start my serenade, to you\u201d.  Perhaps looking to get revenge.  The end of the song also samples part of psychosphere, an allusion to what he may be planning.  \u000a* 6.	Alpha \u2013 This song seems to the narrator coming to realize some of society\u2019s problems with never being content.  The narrator may have been victim of this very problem, always wanting what he can\u2019t have and willing to do questionable things to be able to reach higher places which is how he\u2019s ended up in this situation he\u2019s in.  \u201cWanting what you\u2019ll never have and it\u2019s a goddamn broken state of mind,\u201d he seems to be coming to the realization that the root of most problems come from envy and never being content with what we have.  \u201cIt\u2019s envy been eating away at the core of us, wanting what you\u2019ll never have,\u201d.  \u000a* 7.	22 Faces \u2013 Another song that gets its title from a real life story of a girl named Jenny Hill who is an alleged survivor of a modern day human sacrifice ceremony.  22 faces is the name of the book about her, which is a reference to the 22 multiple personalities that she has from the trauma.  The lyrics of the song express the narrator is trying to live his life day to day and just get by while he is plotting revenge.  Life has turned into a mundane process for him as he keeps his head down and trudges through.  \u201cHave I lost track of time? Yeah!.....Staring at the hourglass, my life, it feels like a machine, running with no direction.\u201d\u000a* 8.	Rainbow Gravity \u2013 Getting its name from a fairly recent and controversial theory of the universe that goes against the big bang theory, Rainbow Gravity continues the dialogue of Alpha but takes it to the extreme.  As the scientific theory states, the universe does not have a single starting or ending point, but goes back and goes forward infinitely, this song talks about the future of humanity and where it is we may be going.  \u201cWill we fall forever alone, down in this unknown abyss\u201d \u2013 maybe a reference to the theory.  \u000a* 9.	Four Lights \u2013 This song is a reference to a fictional mind control experiment taking place in Star Trek The Next Generation season 6 episode 11 \u201cChain of command,  Part II\u201d.  In the episode, Captain Jean-Luc Picard is tortured and attempted to be \u2018programmed\u2019  into saying there are 5 lights lit when there are actually 4 (very similar to 1984\u2019s 2+2=5 scene). Another instrumental, setting up the scene that is about to take place.  \u000a* 10.	Psychosphere \u2013 meaning all realms of consciousness.  Pyschosphere is the climax of the album leading up to what I believe is the scene where he kills those responsible for what happened to him.  He\u2019s separated from his old self and is seemingly a new person and has become the bringer of destruction.  \u201cI am a product of a mind that was never mine and now it says kill them slow\u201d.  He knows that once he does this act he can never go back, \u201cThis is a one way road, kill them slow\u201d.  He views this act as one that may finally free him from the guilt and burden that he\u2019s been carrying ever since, what I suppose would be, his involvement in some kind of cult.  \u201cStop fucking pulling, would you release the grip and let go?! (in reference to the memories and guilt), I\u2019ve got a life to live and a life to end,\u201d \u000a\u000a \u000a**Omega**\u000a\u000a\u000a* 1.	Reprise \u2013 literally meaning a repeated passage of music, this song mimics the black minute from alpha.  \u000a* 2.	The Bad Thing \u2013 Still upset with everything that\u2019s happened to him up to this point the narrator doesn\u2019t know where to direct his anger, \u201cI wish that I could throw everyone and everything,\u201d and is just generally pissed at everything.  \u201cI\u2019d like a reason just to help them bleed, give me a reason come on give it to me,\u201d he has a lot of pent up anger and doesn\u2019t seem to care who he takes it out on.  \u000a* 3.	Priestess-The narrator feels imprisoned still even though he\u2019s in a sense let go of his old life.  Maybe he even is literally imprisoned by other members of the cult,  maybe he only killed his parents or a few of the members.  In this prison he lets the darkness seep into his mind and begins considering taking his own life.   I don\u2019t think he feels as redeemed as he hoped, and is still carrying the full weight as before.  A religious song by name, and in my opinion, makes reference to one of the most religious places in the world in the chorus.  \u201cNevermind what is underneath the stone, this life we live alone,\u201d The stone he\u2019s referencing I believe is the \u201cfoundation stone\u201d which rests in the Jerusalem which has ties to multiple biblical events in Christianity, Judaism and Islam.  Legend has it that buried under the stone was the Ark of the Covenant.  The narrator is saying that we don\u2019t need to worry about the different religions or religion at all, and need to worry about ourselves.   For this story to make sense the narrator would have to have been religious to some extent whether by choice or forced into it since the cult like situation he was in.  Giving up his faith in this song he takes a drastic step moving forward.\u000a* 4.	Graveless -  In graveless the narrator takes his own life, having given up on ever getting his second chance at life, he can\u2019t escape the horrors he has been a part of and having lost his faith (in priestess) sees no other option.  \u000a* 5.	Hell Below \u2013 Fairly straight forward you can probably guess what this song is about.  After taking his life he\u2019s now descending into hell.  \u201cThe demons drag me down, clawing for the heavens, they pull,\u201d\u000a* 6.	Omega \u2013 The title track of the second album, and \u201cend\u201d in the sense of alpha and omega, this is the end of the line for the narrator...or so he thinks.  He continues his journey into the underworld and sees himself for what he became, a demon.   Reliving his atrocities he begins begging for pity.  \u201cI\u2019ve learned from past experience I am a monster\u2026\u201d \u201cTake pity on a soul and grant me resurrection, grant forgiveness\u201d He wishes he didn\u2019t take his own life, \u201cRegret is ripping the throat from my neck,\u201d because now he is stuck in hell, \u201cNow I can\u2019t speak, I wander, here in death, I weep.\u201d  With the final lines he offers the same advice as before, \u201cstop bleeding on the inside, we are alive, and it\u2019s more than enough to paint the walls that are white,\u201d saying that we need to be happy with what we have and that being alive is enough to give us enjoyment and satisfaction.  \u000a* 7.	Stranger Things \u2013 In a twist ending, the album continues!  The narrator continues his new life in hell, \u201cbelow the hadean seal.\u201d  An unknown amount of time has passed, but his sentence has been served \u201cFallen angel, you speak my name,\u201d He\u2019s being called upon, \u201cThe needle turns, the hourglass is spinning around,\u201d signifying that time is up, \u201cGive it, I want it\u2026 a sense of a fucking life,\u201d He believes he\u2019s going to be released.  \u201cTake a breath for seconds in this moment,\u201d he\u2019s taking a deep breath, almost in disbelief of what\u2019s happening, \u201cexhale your death and feel life, like water raining from above,\u201d he has gotten his life back.  \u201cThe tortured realm has released my name, I can feel my body parting with this world. Rebirth is starting from within, I\u2019m born some place beyond your time,\u201d he\u2019s been released and is reborn into the world once again.  Perhaps he is born again at another such cult ritual that he was originally born as the end of stranger things is the same as the intro to a black minute, you could say that he's repeating the cycle.\u000a

sVMy Band - "Möbius Lung"
p580
VSo, I'm in a band called "Möbius Lung." I play guitar and write all of the music and my friend plays drums. Unfortunately, that's all we have right now. We're looking for a bassist with no luck and we'd like to eventually have a vocalist. Also, we don't have a lot of money. So, we're having a hard time growing as a band right now. I managed to buy a recording device called the "H2n" and that's what we've been using to record our music. We just record it live, so there's a few mistakes here and there in our songs that we've uploaded to YouTube. Currently, we've uploaded a total of 8 songs. Most of them need to be re-recorded and re-uploaded because the quality of each recording isn't consistent. So there's still a lot of work to be done... \u000a\u000aWe're very passionate about our music and we won't give up! out of the 8 songs that we have uploaded to YouTube right now, my personal favorite is "A Dissolving of Veils." Let me know what you guys think and keep in mind that these are just cheap demos and they will sound much better once we get more money and at least a bassist!\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZuJxQoihHs\u000a\u000aOne more thing to note is that most of the songs on our first album are going to flow right into each other. This song is one of them, so if it seems like the song just kinda ends abruptly, that's why.\u000a\u000a===EDIT===\u000a\u000aHere's another favorite of mine...\u000a\u000a"Diamond of the Unseen"\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j0uc787Glg\u000a

sVThe future of Djent?
p613
VSo, the latest Periphery Album were both loved and hated. Everyone can at least agree that Juggernaut is a long way from their first EP. \u000a\u000aBands whom were previously against the sound as well as the use of electronic effects have now adapted to the sound. And if history has taught us anything, adaptation is the beginning of the downfall, as well as mass production. The smaller bands who used Djent based sound now has had their one hit and now retracts to their main fanbase.\u000a\u000aPeriphery has in some ways been the "face of djent" as in the way of they should have some credit for making people aware of the sound. And people have been criticising Periphery for "going too poppy" on their last album. Do you guys think that now that record-companies has sucked out the last of the djentlemen or do you think the wave has yet to hit it's peak?\u000a\u000aTL;DR: Is Djent going to become bigger or smaller?

sVAdvice for someone struggling with composition?
p653
VHey guys, this is by far my favorite reddit community and I figured some of the composers and/or music consumers here might have some advice. I'm in the process of writing my very first concept album and so far it has been kind of a nightmare. I have my concept identified and have even wrote out a narrative of the story with characters, etc. I don't really have a problem coming up with riffs, but I'm struggling with piecing the music together to make a cohesive "unit." Things don't seem to fit together and it blows. I truly realize you can't rush this process, but I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels. I would be eternally grateful for any advice. Thanks guys.\u000a\u000aUPDATE: just a little snippet. [Soundcloud link](https://soundcloud.com/gavin-clark/jazzmetal-run)

sV/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)
p661
V---\u000a\u000aWelcome to week one of /r/progmetal's Album of the Week series. Each week we'll pick a new prog metal (or prog metal-related) album to showcase for the sake of an open, comprehensive subreddit discussion. The albums are all moderator-choices and the order of said albums has been randomized so that there is no discernible pattern. Without further ado:\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a#**Band:** Nokturnal Mortum\u000a\u000a#**Album:** The Voice of Steel [(cover art)](http://i.imgur.com/4EJfOV0.jpg)\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a**Released:** December 26, 2009\u000a\u000a**Country:** Ukraine\u000a\u000a**Flavour:** Black, folk, psychedelic, blues\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a**Why we picked it:** Nokturnal Mortum has spent the majority of their career in relative obscurity playing a brand of synth-heavy black metal. However, with their most recent release, *The Voice of Steel,* they really hit on something different. The album is incredibly difficult to characterize, as it incorporates so many different stylings and influences. At its core, it's black metal that makes use of traditional Ukrainian folk instruments and melodies (see *The Voice of Steel* and *Ukraine*). But to me, this album stands out due to its numerous oddball elements. The dream-like, ethereal, at times psychedelic, soundscapes are one of such examples (see *My Dream Islands* and *White Tower*). One of the most special moments on the disc is probably the bluesy soloing that occurs in the latter half of *Valkyrie,* an absolute standout track. Rather than going on about the little things that make this album special, I'm going to simply say that it's the amalgamation of all of them that makes *The Voice of Steel* a journey. This musical achievement is  something that no one else is really doing, or has done before (at least in this way), and is one of the most progressive things I've heard in years (in an aural sense, rather than technical). If you don't listen to the full thing right now, I will fucking kill you. \u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a**Featured track:** [Valkyrie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtQ0i3oOYdc)\u000a\u000a**Full Album Stream:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcsVp0A4Vik)\u000a\u000a[Wikipedia Entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice_of_Steel)\u000a\u000a[Metal Archives Entry](http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Nokturnal_Mortum/%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81_%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%96_%28The_Voice_of_Steel%29/257430)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

sV[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega
p701
VThe albums leaked a few hours ago (**don't share links to illegal downloads.** Mark announced an album stream for tomorrow, if you can't find a download link). \u000a\u000aWhat does everyone think of it?\u000a\u000aJuggernaut: Alpha has quite the few pop-ish moments, I noticed. It takes some getting used to. In fact, the whole album might take a while to grow on me because this clearly isn't classic Periphery (not a bad thing). Reminds of The Dear Hunter, even though this album is more "all-over-the-place", in terms of genres, which I find hard to appreciate at the moment.\u000a\u000aThe second album is more like P2, I think. I like it a lot more than the first half. One gripe I have is the fact that Omega isn't the album closer. That track is, in my opinion, the best Periphery song to date. The last chorus, reprising Alpha's chorus, works perfectly. And the breakdown is fucking amazing. Then Strange Things comes on and, while it's not a bad song, it kind of just drags the album on unnecessarily.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind I have no clue what the lyrical content is about.\u000a\u000aSorry if I'm doing something illegal, mods, but I think this is ok.\u000a\u000aEdit: I'm hearing it for the second time, I forgot to mention how much I love the melody reprises throughout the album. And how much I hate that the album has these 1 second pauses between songs, even though they're clearly supposed to seamlessly flow into eachother. I hope it's only a problem in the leaked files.\u000a\u000a[Juggernaut: Alpha is now streaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDDZyf3qzVw&amp;list=PLH22-xSMERQp9Jq_FLpgQ57BHZEm132Nz)

VHey, /r/progmetal, after browsing in a few other subs, it's come to my attention that we don't have any sort of collaborative music sharing thing going on, with the exception of our (awesome) Hall of Fame. \u000a\u000aSo, I'd like to propose we make a couple Spotify playlists:\u000a\u000a1.

sVLooking to expand my listening catalog, bands similar to Dillinger Escape Plan
p765
VGreetings, \u000a\u000aI started listening to Dillinger Escape Plan about 3 years ago, and really got into them about 2 years ago. They were really my first introduction into prog metal! My favorite album is Ire Works and my favorite song is widower. I like Greg's vocal range, and I essentially slowly started to enjoy their heavier and noisier tracks. Widower is my favorite melodic track, and Milk Lizard (I know it isn't the heaviest) is my favorite heavier track. I particularly like how Greg's throatier vocals go from somewhat understandable, to all out reckless vocals. \u000a\u000aI read a bunch of interviews with Greg in particular and worked my way backwards based on their influences. Nine Inch Nails came up, and Trent is okay, I prefer his movie scores and instrumentals. I have been trying really hard to get into Mr. Bungle, but a lot of it sounds like strange circus music. I like "California" okay. I prefer Patton's work with Faith No More. \u000a\u000aI like everything I have heard from Tool. When I was a wee lass without a very developed musical taste I bought just by chance the BTBAM album colors, and really liked the track "Prequel to the Sequel". I'm also a big fan of Mastodon and Baroness. Not prog, but I was raised on Southern Rock, bands/songs with Southern Rock influences I would probably like.

sVDo you like concept albums? Let's talk about instrumental endings and what they mean!
p779
VSo, I love concept albums. Most of us here do. And I recently had my mind blown by [heavyblog's BTBAM breakdown](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2012/07/24/prognotes-between-the-buried-and-mes-the-parallax-part-i-introduction/), which got me to thinking about some of my other favorite endings to albums. You may or may not have had similar experiences with these albums and songs, but I'd be curious to hear your input on some of my favorite ambiguous endings:\u000a\u000a* **Isolate** (Circus Maximus). What exactly does the ominous clank and cut-off of the music represent? To me, the final lyrics ("I'm a survivor and this is my destiny") represent our protagonist finally defeating his insanity. But then what about the orchestral bit that follows? It's positive. Perhaps a bit exhausted, but definitely hopeful. And then the sudden clank. It's a plot twist! Does it represent a relapse back into insanity, or was he never in control of his mind in the first place? His triumphant declaration could just have been shouted at padded walls....What do you think it all means?\u000a\u000a* **The Great Escape** (Seventh Wonder). What does the final instrumental section represent? It obviously mirrors the opening section, in which Earth ("Tellus" from Wiseman) says a tearful goodbye to her destructive children (humanity). But the final section has no lyrics. Interesting! Does this mean that Earth has forever lost her voice (humanity's sins were irreversible)? What emotion is being communicated? My current head canon is "forgiveness," but I'm undecided whether this comes from a dying mother earth or a now thriving one sans humanity (as they tragically perish in space, unbeknownst to Earth). The final section is positive, trails off, and feels more definite than the first one, though still tender. What's your head canon?\u000a\u000a* **V- The New Mythology Suite** (Symphony X). What does that last three-note cello bit mean? I might be reading too much into this, but I really feel like that motif is the final word in the story: the moral, the summary, the feeling we're meant to leave with as Atlantis slips forever away. I take it as one part cautionary (learn from Atlantis's technological hubris), one part sorrow (everything I've ever known is forever lost), and one part hopeful (whoever hears this tale won't repeat the same mistakes). What's your take?\u000a\u000a* **King of Terrors** (also Symphony X). The song closely follows Poe's short story, The Pit and the Pendulum, but does it part ways at the end? In Poe's version, the protagonist is saved by French soldiers moments from his death. So why does King of Terrors end on such a menacing fade out? Does it represent the fading terror he leaves behind as he is taken to safety, or is it maybe a dark creative license taken by the band...Is the final "...LAST" really his last breath?\u000a\u000aI apologize for the wall of text that maybe not very many will relate to, but I had to get these thoughts written down somewhere, and I don't know of a better community to share them with. Cheers if you read it all.

So I decided to check out their other stuff and came across this album. \u000a\u000aTell me what you guys think. They are very different. They have a female vocalist, which is definitely gonna take some getting used to, but their instrumentals are fucking brilliant! I've only heard about two songs so far and I'm still trying to decide if I love it or not, but it's definitely an interesting listen.

VThis has happened several times in the last year at shows like Scale the Summit and The Contortionist.\u000aFull disclosure....i am now 44 however i am not too old as the saying goes.  I love loud music but when i have paid money to see a band play i want to be able to hear the damn music not a vast group of locusts attacking the venue!\u000aI want to go to shows but i am seriously considering not going anymore.  \u000aI have been to so many concerts in my life since my dad was the ticket manager for a big entertainment venue while i was young so i know what loud is and what completely distorted hell is!!!!!\u000a\u000aPlease chime in and lets do the bands a favor and allow their audiences be able to hear them as they intended....im sure they would appreciate it.\u000a\u000aThere is a saying that goes....you can't do what you want in chess you have to do what you need to.\u000aThis goes for the sound guys or the whomever is in charge of the sound at that venue..  Just because you don't have great acoustics doesn't mean you can ignore it....TURN THAT SHIT DOWN SO WE CAN HEAR IT PROPERLY!!!

Hell, I am currently wearing a Meshuggah beanie that I bought at one of their concerts. I also love bands like Mastodon, Gojira, Tool and Between the Buried and Me and that sort of thing. Well, recently I came across this band through YouTube's related videos and I know they're not super heavy like Meshuggah, but I have listened to this album like every day for the past week. It has really grown on me! The vocalist is a little strange and it might take a while to get used to him, but they are just so talented. My favorite song is the last one on this EP titled, "Crystallised." There's like this Acapella part in that song that you might think is a little weird at first, which I understand, cuz it threw me off. lol But just give them a chance. The part at 27:14 is what makes the whole song so damn good, in my opinion! Tell me what you guys think...

sVFind a terrible review of one of your favorite albums, post it here and lol
p901
V"The amazing thing about Meshuggah\u2019s Nothing is that in many ways it is an album that does nothing.\u000a\u000aOn the surface this has all of the elements that gave Meshuggah their distinct sound. The bizarre time signatures are here as is the meaty guitar sound and Jens Kidman\u2019s unique gravelly bark. The production is excellent and contributes to a very clean sound that adds to the technical sounding nature of the album. And it\u2019s heavy. In fact it\u2019s a positively brutal sound that even many full fledged death metal bands fail to get without relying heavily on blast beats.\u000a\u000aThough they were always heavily influenced by their rhythm section there was always a semblance on writing some sort of song which went somewhere. If you listen to the seminal Destroy Erase Improve there is a demented thrash vibe that permeates the album coupled with more melancholy moments (e.g. Acrid Placidity). There are different tempos and each song sounds like a separate song, with its own vibe and intent. Not on Nothing.\u000a\u000aOn Nothing, Meshhugah strip away any vestige of song writing. As a result it creates the impression of one giant monotonous off kilter riff that goes on for nearly an hour. The songs, if they can be called that, merge into one another to form one giant amorphous mass. There is absolutely no variation on the album except for the pointless waffle at the end.\u000a\u000aContributing to the monotony is that the album seems toneless and is stuck in the same speed through out. There is no real variation in the songs, the tempo at which they\u2019re played, the riffs played or Kidman\u2019s vocals\u000a\u000aIn many ways it\u2019s like listening to a CD skipping on the same spot. It is undeniably heavy and it is technically sophisticated but it\u2019s a mindless heaviness and an equally mindless technicality.\u000a\u000aTo sum it up in five words, Nothing is mind numbingly boring."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy favorite part is "The bizarre time signatures are here "  *MOST OF NOTHING IS IN 4/4 MY GOD*

VI'm really disappointed. Somebody expressed that he doesn't like Periphery's new record. For whatever reasons. Doesn't matter. That's not why I'm upset. What I really don't like is that every single one of his comments in the thread was downvoted to at least -5. This is not how I know this sub, normally we have proper discussions about our different tastes without having to downvote somebody who doesn't agree with our tastes. I think it's really childish and simply not what this sub should represent, which is a community with many different tastes, with the common factor that we like progressive metal. If our tastes diverge, we talk about why they do, what we like about a band and what we don't like about them, and then understand that different people have different tastes. No need to be negativ about anything. At least this is what I would like the sub to be.

sVNon-metal flair suggestion
p964
VI recently received a lot of responses to a comment I made in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2vsrfa/the_dear_hunter_the_bitter_suite_607/) where I pointed out that whilst I really liked the song (and have now since found a new band to obsess over), it wasn't metal. A lot of people jumped down my throat saying that there is often an overlap in interests that span across other genres and so-on and that posts like that should be welcomed. It made me feel very silly that I pointed it out in the first place, because I also actually like it when we spice things up and throw in songs that have this overlap, I wouldn't have found a new band if it weren't for it. So my suggestion is obviously not to exclude this stuff, because obviously there is elements to other types of music that appeal to fans of progmetal on the same levels of interest. So perhaps a new "non-metal" or "not metal" flair could be added to these submissions if anyone, for whatever reason, wants to filter them in or out? I suggested it in that thread and a few people seemed to like the idea.

sVLet's talk about live sound
p981
VSo last night my buddy and I were lucky enough to see The Contortionist/Revocation/Fallujah show. All three of thise bands feature fantastic musicians who not only excel in musicianship, but also crafting great songs.\u000a\u000aThat said, the wild inconsistency in live SOUND quality drives me crazy. Not necessarily between venues - that's a given. I'm talking about between bands playing the same gig. \u000a\u000aTake the first of those bands to play, Fallujah. Their sound is a very melodic and harmonious one. One of the things my ear gravitates towards is the intricate melodies layed by their guitarists. But I swear, if I had never listened to Fallujah before last night, i wouldn't have had the slightest clue what was going on. The guitars were barely audible even during the solos - smothered beneath a wall of muddled bass and vocals.\u000a\u000aSo the night moves on. Revocation is on next. Dave Davidson does a breif sound check and gets the balance he likes and they start jamming. This mix is a step up - not ideal, but this time I can discern actual riffs. I'm not super familiar with their catalogue so it was a good barometer for the clarity of sound. \u000a\u000aFinally the contortionist. Crystal clear sound. The bass drum is a nice balanced trigger (I think it was triggered) and doesn't overpower on the low end. The guitars are razor sharp and the bass has a nice thwack to it without muddling everything up.\u000a\u000aSo why is there so little consistency? Are some performers simply unaware of their mix or is it a question of available gear when opening versus headlining? Anyone out there with mixing experience I'd love to hear what you think.\u000a\u000aEdit: Thanks for the great responses everyone!

Vhttps://soundcloud.com/chaosdivine/sets/colliding-skies\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a... and it's quite good. According to [their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/chaosdivine/posts/10152871958088122) this stream is courtesy of Heavy Music Magazine and should disappear after this week, so best listen to it while you can.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aIf you don't know Chaos Divine, they're a great band from Perth, Australia, self-described as 'Progressive Heavy Rock', which roughly translates to 'mostly clean Progressive Metal with occasional tasteful Death Metal vocals'. Their previous album, 2011's 'The Human Connection', is one of my favourites and this new one sounds great as well.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aThe new album was [successfully crowdfunded](http://www.pozible.com/project/180797) last year and can now be pre-ordered [here](http://www.nervegas.com.au/?rf=kw&amp;kw=colliding+skies). It will be released March 6th.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aRecommended tracks: *Before the Dawn* and *The Shepherd*
