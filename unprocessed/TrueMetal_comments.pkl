p55
aVThanks, I haven't looked into black metal that much yet. But from the discussions I've read it's clear there's a clear distinction--like with most old-school black metal bands--between their old and new stuff.

VThe more a genre becomes popular, the more it begins being overrun with easy selling cliches that appeal to a wider, less demanding audience while having the unavoidable side effect of lowering the quality. Back in the 90's it happened with symphonic black metal (suddenly everybody became a harpsicord wielding vampire); later on, power metal's turn came, with fast high pitches and dragons popping up everywhere. In both cases, the overall quality of the genre was severly damaged, in terms both of new bands coming out sounding quite the same and older acts being forced to chase the this cheapened new wave everybody was so excited about.\u000a\u000aNow, it's not all bad: as long as something is able to drag more people into metal, then it's a good thing. It only takes a little more patience to dodge all the shit in order to pick the right bands in some genres, but usually the effort is worth the while
p78
aVThank you! I really like "folkier" folk metal. All too often, you get garbage like your first link. I mean, I know what metal sounds like. And, metal is my favorite genre. If you are going to infuse other genres into metal, at least make it apparent. A lot of "folk metal" is a drop of folk in a bucket of metal. Its slightly better than accidentally running across a folk riff every once in a while. The stuff you linked to was pretty good. I would even prefer a bit more folk in my metal, but still pretty awesome.
p79
aVI don't think you're "too dumb"?  I think you just don't care for it.  \u000a\u000aPersonally, I really enjoy three subgenres of metal:  melodeath (old In Flames, Dark Tranquility, At The Gates, etc.), technical death (Necrophagist, Origin, Hate Eternal, etc.), and folk metal (I love Eluveitie).  \u000a\u000aI also really dislike black metal (I find it pretentious) and doom metal (I get bored with it quickly). \u000a\u000aI don't think black or doom metal "sucks" or that I'm "too dumb" to understand it.  It's just not my bag.
p80
aVi liked the first group the most as far as folk metal goes... the instruments give a feel for me along with some cool fables of demons and dragons and ancient lore...not a hardcore fan but certainly prefer folk metal of all metal genres.. thanks for the links
p81
aVMost of the big folk metal bands are as you said: watered down metal with a bunch of folk thrown in.  That being said I do enjoy Ensiferum, they're pretty popular but they're waaaaaaaay better than Eluveitie, Korpiklaani, Arkona etc (imo).  Ensiferum certainly isn't as folky as other bands.  \u000a\u000aFor other bands you should probably know: Moonsorrow, Windir, Nokturnal Mortum, Primordial
p82
aVNotice, how most of the bands you mentioned in the first paragraph are closer to what they call "viking" metal, incorporating death growls with heavily laid folk instruments, and the bands in the second paragraph are what they call "pagan" with black metal influences and much less folk instrumentation, relying more on creating the "atmosphere" of folk.
p83
aVYeah, Windir is really awesome. 
p84
aVFor your first link, eluveitie look like it care more about the traditional instrument than the guitar (but in helvetios (their last album) the riffs are better) and if you don't know, inis mona is a "cover" of a very famous celtic song (tri martolod)

For a small town like Perth this band was  too big...but for reality and content , there really was nowhere else....the band was deep, the lyrics and music wasnt trend , it was emotion and culture, Samain was fucking deep...and maybe that didnt sell?\u000a\u000aWe still have the gems though...and this band is worth some credit. The Demo is the best from my POV, the album...amazing...but Im old school...love it, but I want that striving emotion...\u000a\u000a(Album and demo is available online with a Google blog search, well worth it and legal..the band and label they were on are dead)

aVThere's just tooooooo many.
p225
aVTo go through, or that you'd want?\u000a\u000aHonestly, the only stuff that I'd say I'm 100% against trading are the Desolation Angels LP, Elixir's Son of Odin, Legend's From the Fjords and the Death SS 7".
p226
aVThat i'd want.\u000a\u000aTraveller is one of my favorite albums, in my top ten for sure so there's very few things i would let it go for. A big one being Blind Guardian's - Banished From Sanctuary 7". Anything else i would want to trade i either already have or are almost non-existent. Like Killen - S/T and Leader - Out In The Wasteland. And even in those cases it would be hard. 
p227
aVNo worries, totally understandable. \u000a\u000aKillen pops up from time to time but it's gotten stupid expensive recently. One of these days ...

aVYea last time I saw that Killen, it was on a sell list for \u20ac300
p229
aVNice collection. I see some of my favorites in there (Bathory, Judas Priest, Omen, Celtic Frost, Running Wild, Tank, etc.). I was actually at a shop today where someone had sold back some decent 80s metal, but it was mostly thrash and that's not my bag. (Plus it's primarily a bookstore and their records are overpriced based on price guides). Still, it's unusual to see Testament, Toxik, etc. records in bins around here.\u000a\u000aI've got some decent stuff, but not a collection I'd ever stack against yours.\u000a\u000aThere is [/r/vinyl](/r/vinyl), but it's overrun with Pitchfork-approved indie rock, people who just inherited their relatives' record collections and people posting cameraphone pics of their latest haul of "gems" (read: dollar records) from Goodwill. Occasionally some good stuff sneaks through, but by and large it's a disappointing subreddit.
p230
aVThanks dude. \u000aYea i see records in store that don't usually carry them and sometimes i get lucky. I found that Warrant LP for 8 bucks in a book store.
p231
aVYeah, i just started collecting about a year ago, it mainly started when i went to France and raided every single record store i could find (btw if you're ever in Marseilles, there is a metal shop called Sabre Tooth which is probably the best record store i have ever been to.)\u000a\u000aI'm at college so i can't take pics of anything (no way would i take my shit to a dorm) but some of the gems i'm rather proud of are:\u000a\u000aDepravity - Remasquerade 7"\u000aAdramelech - Spring of Recovery 7"\u000aArghoslent - Incorrigible Biggotry\u000aLantlos - .neon\u000a\u000aI know there are some i'm forgetting but those are probably the rarest i own atm, i only have a collection of about 45 total.

p402
(lp403
VI have a group of about 6 friends. Between the 7 of us, we play in a few different bands--a death metal band, a doom metal band, and a punk band. I'm super into trad metal, NWOBHM, old school thrash, old school death, etc. My tastes have always leaned towards the older sound, I don't know why. The other dudes always give me a hard time when I wear an Angel Witch shirt to our shows when they're all wearing Abominable Putridity or Aborted shirts or whatever. I think it's hilarious, especially when you realize that the old school stuff is responsible for everything else. Without the early pioneers, we'd never have the extreme stuff. 
p404
aVI feel the same way-ish, but (and I'm really trying not to sound hipster here, sorry), I kinda feel more that way as some of the 'trad' bands like Iced Earth, gamma Ray whatever... I think they're pretty mainstream if that makes sense? \u000a\u000aI think it's because of my age more than anything. I'm 37, and being a teenager/early twenties in the 90s meant that there really wasn't a huge amount of good metal around, or at least you had to search for it. By around 2000 it was coming back a bit, festivals like Wacken were starting to really be noticed, and those were the guys that were headlining a lot of the time. \u000a\u000aI tend to think of 'obscure' trad metal to be bands like Doomhammer, Quartz, Preying Mantis and stuff - the second and third tier early 80s bands that would turn up on 'metal for muthas' Vinyl collections - a fair bit turns up on /r/headbangtothis too. \u000a\u000aFor me, even though the songwriting isn't always as amazing as their larger contemporaries, or they aren't the heaviest, I think that a lot of those bands really embrace the sheer, wonderful lunacy of metal. They're hilarious and over-the-top, but that doesn't mean they aren't serious either, they just embrace it and push things to their logical extent. I always loved a lot of Thrash for the same reason. For me, that sense of heart and love of the music that makes you want to headbang *instinctively* is what metal is all about, and you don't need to be super-technical to do it, you've just got to be... true metal! 
p405
aVI definitely think age plays into it. I'm only 21 so my generation was exposed to a lot of processed music. Not that it's bad but I believe we simply lost appreciation for rawness. Genres like black metal (my favourite sub-genre) sound best in a lo-fi environment usually but it's more of a joke among my peers that I'm the black metal guy because they haven't really experienced the intensity of the music.
p406
aVI guess that's probably true - I do remember when the NWOSDM came along in the 90s and it was excellent, bands like In Flames, Dark tranquility and Arch Enemy's early stuff was great but less processed than those bands sound now - there's definitely a touch of Linkin Park on the new In Flames album - it's just gotten more processed over time and I think that's kind of a shame as it's lost a lot of its individuality because of it. I guess you need to work your way up to really raw black stuff! I kind of came in through iron maiden, got into thrash then death, then black... and ended up listening to bands like Watchmaker or stuff like Merzbow, so there's a progression, but it seems like maybe there isn't the chance to do that organically as much anymore, weirdly because you can get hold of almost anything really easily, you might be less likely to mail off to Belgium for an obscure doom demo (Or possibly I'm just a weirdo who still does that sort of thing :)
p407
aVI see a little bit of appreciation for old stuff but honestly among my peers and whatever shell of a metal scene exists in my city, I just don't find anything in common with most people. 
p408
aV&gt; I think that a lot of those bands really embrace the sheer, wonderful lunacy of metal. They're hilarious and over-the-top, but that doesn't mean they aren't serious either, they just embrace it and push things to their logical extent. I always loved a lot of Thrash for the same reason. For me, that sense of heart and love of the music that makes you want to headbang instinctively is what metal is all about, and you don't need to be super-technical to do it, you've just got to be... true metal!\u000a\u000aWell put. I always try to explain this to people when they say how cheesy my album collection is. \u000a\u000a
p409
aVAgreed! I once went to a festival and in order to limit how many albums I bought, I made a rule that I'd only buy if it had a picture of a dude with an axe on the front. I bought 27 albums that weekend( oh, and Iron Angel are an awesome band by the way;).

aV'you only like the good stuff, elitist'\u000aI like to listen to shitty ass fake piss-willy metal because I'm not an elitist like you.
p412
aVI feel as though traditional heavy metal is still alive.  You just have to look hard for it.  Bands like Iced Earth, 3 Inches of Blood, Varga, and many others keep the spirit of metal alive and well. \u000aTake my band for instance, we're just a bunch of Judas Priest nuts coming together to make music that (surprisingly) sounds like Priest. \u000aMetal has unfortunately deteriorated over the years in terms of the quality of music.  The audio quality is great, but the music itself is so generic and bland.  You're not alone my friend.  Metallica, Slayer, Maiden, Priest, W.A.S.P., Megadeth, and Anthrax will always be my favourites.

p416
aVYes the production standards changed a lot. In HM the apparition of numeric era was a big step. From now on musicians had tools that could avoid to spend hours recording but also allow them to cheat a bit. Lately i was reading some article from Neudi's official fb page (Drummer in Roxxcalibur and Manilla Road and sound engineer) and this guys is just an encyclopedia , he tell much about the differences between 80' band and metalheads and today scene vision of it, as he've been a witness of its changes through time. And one of the subject he spoke about was, are the numeric tools reducing the general quality of music (metal here) as drummers use trigger and guitarists use simulation amps, and sequencer that allows to record a track in several times and not in one shot as it was back in time , etc , etc ... He sometimes slip into total subjectivity but i think it's assumed and besides of that, is informations are always quite relevant ! Check for him if you want to know more !

(lp462
V&gt;Now I know there is no accounting for taste\u2014\u2014sure. But is music all so subjective that you can\u2019t even form a coherent opinion about it without being narrow-minded? That\u2019s what people seem to be telling me. I listen to what is considered \u201cmusic\u201d these days, and my response is almost always the same. If it has any melodic quality at all, or even any rhythmic quality, it\u2019s usually so painfully unmemorable that I could hear the record a thousand times over in a six-month period, and on the seventh month not be able to recall even one riff. Sure, I might remember that it sounded \u201ckinda doomy\u201d or \u201ckinda thrashy\u201d due to the guitar sound, vocal style (or the label its on!!), but chances are that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ll be able to recall.
p463
aVThat column was an expression of my thought I've been unable to make for the last year or two. I'm definitely sharing it with my elitist bandmates.\u000a\u000aSome explanation:\u000aFor my second year of school I decided to live in the dorms. Somehow I wound up in the music students dorm (I'm not a music major). I thought this was cool.\u000a\u000aI met more kids in my life than ever before who were self-professed metal fans. I thought this was cool. Then I listened to what they call metal. Having started with the big four at the beginning of high school, being introduced to prog by DT and Symphony X, and now digging my way through my love of folk, tech-death, and obscure tech-prog, I didn't know how to respond. Their idea of metal seemed to be loud and brutal. Don't get me wrong, those are two key components of metal. But when they're all you have...well, the music you make isn't metal.\u000a\u000atl;dr Met a bunch of posers last year who showed me what the kids think of metal these days.

p862
aVAs far as I know, there is no band called Rhinocervs, only the label/distro. They release compilation tapes that are generally labeled under the Rhinocervs name (essentially serving as an anonymous label). They will label the artist if they mean to (see Odour of Dust and Rot).

p1810
aVWolvhammer is pretty cool, the fact they keep changing styles a bit from album to album keeps me interested in their future.. went from a blackened crust to a more "profound lore"-ish sound (longer tracks, more atmosphere and less crust, I guess).  \u000a\u000aSince the two Twilight albums were really different, I feel this third and final one should be firing on all cylinders, or at least be interesting.

p1930
aVI find that it is pretty truly bad.  its mostly formulaic ,it could be recorded by any studio band, and it always seemed to me that they would right one edgy lyric and just keep coming back to that one line like they are really proud of it.  i don't care about vocals, and lyrics much but its a big part of nu-metal.  its just radio poprock  and most all of that is rather turdy.  
p1931
aVyou see, i don't agree. i've heard five finger detah punch or avenged sevenfold being called nu-metal, and it does make some sense, kinda between a hard rock and metal, but anyway, i enjoy these bands. i know what separates them from amon amarth for example, but i don't think those diffreences make them any better or worse, just different

Then forms Ulver, only plays on the first demo, leaves the band because they weren't evil enough. He's kinda like Norway's Paul Ledney. IMO, his work with both of those bands is some of their best material. His influence to the songwriting is instantly evident if you are familiar with VBE.\u000a\u000a[Satyricon - All Evil (All Evil Demo 1992)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1QvDWEx2us)\u000a\u000a\u000a[Ulver - Tragidiens Trone (Vargnatt Demo 1993)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLfFkktE90Y)

p2209
aVYea I think that's where I downloaded it from, along with the demos.  But Antti himself has them (well, reprints) for sale on his webstore so it's one of those rare times I can pick up an old classic AND still support the artist as opposed to a re-seller.

VI used to run one so maybe this is just shitty self-promotion or whatever but I think we did a good job of keeping things varied. We were called [The Hand ov Doom] (http://www.metal-injection.net/hand-ov-doom). My goal with the show was to base each episode on some theme that brings a lot of different bands together. Sometimes it was lyrical content, sometimes musical. If you like it let me know what you think! Cheers!\u000a\u000aEDIT: Turns out the podcast has been deleted. Bummer. I have all the episodes...I can soundcloud 'em or mediafire or something if you're really that interested.
p2347
aVThanks, sounds pretty cool, but I doubt I'd listen to more than one or two.  If you ever post them for another reason put something on TrueMetal and I'll give it a go.
p2348
aVHellcast is pretty good. It's affiliated with Hells Headbangers. I learned of Hic Iacet from that podcast. Pretty good mix of sub-genres, and lot's of interviews (one with the artist Putrid that I remember). It's available on iTunes. I don't really follow it anymore, but it's definitely a lot better than the slew of shit podcasts with shit bands and shit content.
p2349
aVShit, I had the name wrong, I searched "hell's headbangers". Thanks man.  
p2350
aVhttp://www.ritualmadnesspodcast.com/\u000a\u000aMinnesota Loud and Local! They play all sorts of music on here and talk a lot about Minnesota based artists and bands, usualy they have a guest on air with them. They are funny as hell, I love em! you can get them on Itunes as well.\u000a
p2351
aVI'll give it a look, thanks.
p2352
aVThe older "Talking Metal" podcasts on iTunes were pretty cool. There's two types of episodes, from what I remember - music, and interviews. I picked up a couple of new favorite from the music ones, and the interviews are always cool. Check out the one with Vinnie Paul - it takes place right as Hellyeah's first album came out, so you get to hear some cool stories.
